Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000
If they reach just 12 of the worlds population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by years end

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only about 4 of the present number of computer users

At our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium

PART II WAR


21 THE SHOW IS CONFISCATED

You hav perhaps wondered wharebouts I was for these many dase
gone and past Perchans you sposed Id gone to the Tomb of
the Cappylets tho I dont know what those is Its a popler
noospaper frase

Listen to my tail and be silent that ye may here Ive been
among the Seseshers a earnin my daily peck by my legitimit
perfeshun and havnt had no time to weeld my facile quill for
the Grate Komick paper if youll allow me to kote from your
troothful advertisement

My success was skaly and I likewise had a narrer scape of my
life If what Ive bin threw is Suthren hosspitality bout
which weve hearn so much then I feel bound to obsarve that
they made two much of me They was altogether two lavish with
their attenshuns

I went amung the Seseshers with no feelins of annermosity I
went in my perfeshernal capacity I was actooated by one of
the most Loftiest desires which can swell the human Buzzum
vizto giv the peeple their moneys worth by showin them
Sagashus Beests and Wax Statoots which I venter to say air
onsurpast by any other statoots anywheres I will not call
that man who sez my statoots is humbugs a lier and a hoss
thief but bring him be4 me and Ill wither him with one of my
scornful frowns

But to proseed with my tail In my travels threw the Sonny
South I heared a heap of talk about Seceshon and bustin up the
Union but I didnt think it mounted to nothin The
politicians in all the villages was swearin that Old Abe
sometimes called the Prahayrie flower shouldnt never be
noggerated They also made fools of theirselves in varis
ways but as they was used to that I didnt let it worry me
much and the Stars and Stripes continued for to wave over my
little tent Moor over I was a Son of Malty and a member of
several other Temperance Societies and my wife she was a
Dawter of Malty an I sposed these fax would secoor me the
infloonz and pertectiun of all the fust families Alas I
was dispinted State arter State seseshed and it growed
hotter and hotter for the undersined Things came to a
climbmacks in a small town in Alabamy where I was premtorally
ordered to haul down the Stars  Stripes A deppytashun of
redfaced men cum up to the door of my tent ware I was standin
takin money the arternoon exhibishun had commenst an my
Italyun organist was jerkin his solestirrin chimes We air
cum Sir said a millingtary man in a cockt hat upon a hi
and holy mishun The Southern Eagle is screamin threwout this
sunny landproudly and defiantly screamin Sir

Whats the matter with him sez I dont his vittles sit
well on his stummick

That Eagle Sir will continner to scream all over this Brite
and tremenjus land

Wall let him SCREAM If your Eagle can amuse hisself by
screamin let him went The men anoyed me for I was Bizzy
makin change

We are cum Sir upon a matter of dooty

Youre right Capting Its every mans dooty to visit my
show said I

We air cum

And thats the reason you are here sez I larfin one of my
silvery larfs I thawt if he wanted to goak Id giv him sum
of my sparklin eppygrams

Sir youre inserlent The plain question is will you haul
down the StarSpangled Banner and hist the Southern flag

Nary hist Those was my reply

Your wax works and beests is then confisticated  you air
arrested as a Spy

Sez I My fragrant roses of the Southern clime and Bloomin
daffodils whats the price of whisky in this town and how
many cubic feet of that seductive flooid can you individooally
hold

They made no reply to that but said my wax figgers was
confisticated I axed them if that was ginerally the stile
among thieves in that country to which they also made no
reply but said I was arrested as a Spy and must go to
Montgomry in iuns They was by this time jined by a large
crowd of other Southern patrits who commenst hollerin Hang
the baldheaded aberlitionist and bust up his immoral
exhibition I was ceased and tied to a stump and the crowd
went for my tentthat waterproof pavilion wherein
instruction and amoosment had been so muchly combined at 15
cents per headand tore it all to pieces Meanwhile dirty
faced boys was throwin stuns and empty beer bottles at my
massiv brow and takin other improper liberties with my
person Resistance was useless for a varity of reasons as I
readily obsarved

The Seseshers confisticated my statoots by smashin them to
attums They then went to my money box and confisticated all
the loose change therein contaned They then went and bust in
my cages lettin all the animils loose a small but helthy
tiger among the rest This tiger has a excentric way of
tearin dogs to peaces and I allers sposed from his gineral
conduck that hed hav no hesitashun in servin human beins in
the same way if he could get at them Excuse me if I was
crooil but I larfed boysterrusly when I see that tiger spring
in among the people Go it my sweet cuss I inardly
exclaimed I forgive you for bitin off my left thum with all
my heart Rip em up like a bully tiger whose Lare has bin
inwaded by Seseshers

I cant say for certain that the tiger serisly injured any of
them but as he was seen a few days after sum miles distant
with a large and well selected assortment of seats of trowsis
in his mouth and as he lookt as tho hed been havin sum
vilent exercise I rayther guess he did You will therefore
perceive that they didnt confisticate him much

I was carried to Montgomry in iuns and placed in durans vial
The jail was a ornery edifiss but the table was librally
surplied with Bakin an Cabbidge This was a good variety for
when I didnt hanker after Bakin I could help myself to the
cabbige

I had nobody to talk to nor nothin to talk about howsever
and I was very lonely specially on the first day so when the
jailer parst my lonely sell I put the few stray hairs on the
back part of my hed Im bald now but thare was a time when I
wore sweet auburn ringlets into as dishhevild a state as
possible  rollin my eyes like a manyyuck I cride Stay
jaler stay I am not mad but soon shall be if you dont
bring me suthin to Talk He brung me sum noospapers for
which I thanked him kindly

At larst I got a interview with Jefferson Davis the President
of the Southern Conthieveracy He was quite perlite and axed
me to sit down and state my case I did it when he larfed
and said his gallunt men had been a little 2 enthoosiastic in
confisticatin my show

Yes sez I they confisticated me too muchly I had sum
hosses confisticated in the same way onct but the
confisticaters air now poundin stun in the States Prison in
Injinnapylus

Wall wall Mister Ward you air at liberty to depart you air
friendly to the South I know Even now we hav many frens in
the North who sympathize with us and wont mingle with this
fight

J Davis theres your grate mistaik Many of us was your
sincere frends and thought certin parties amung us was fussin
about you and meddlin with your consarns intirely too much
But J Davis the minit you fire a gun at the piece of dry
goods called the StarSpangled Banner the North gits up and
rises en massy in defence of that banner Not agin you as
individooalsnot agin the South evenbut to save the flag
We should indeed be weak in the knees unsound in the heart
milkwhite in the liver and soft in the hed if we stood
quietly by and saw this glorus Govyment smashed to pieces
either by a furrin or a intestine foe The gentleharted
mother hates to take her naughty child across her knee but
she knows it is her dooty to do it So we shall hate to whip
the naughty South but we must do it if you dont make back
tracks at onct and we shall wallup you out of your boots J
Davis it is my decided opinion that the Sonny South is makin
a egrejus muttonhed of herself

Go on sir youre safe enuff Youre two small powder for
me sed the President of the Southern Conthieveracy

Wait till I go home and start out the Baldinsville Mounted
Hoss Cavalry Im Capting of that Corpse I am and J Davis
beware Jefferson D I now leave you Farewell my gay Saler
Boy Goodbye my bold buccaneer Pirut of the deep blue
sea adoo adoo

My tower threw the Southern Conthieveracy on my way home was
thrillin enuff for yeller covers It will form the subjeck of
my next Betsy Jane and the projeny air well

Yours respectively

A Ward


22 THRILLING SCENES IN DIXIE

I had a narrer scape from the sonny South The swings and
arrers of outrajus fortin alluded to by Hamlick warnt
nothin in comparison to my trubles I come pesky near swearin
sum profane oaths moren onct but I hope I didnt do it for
Ive promist she whose name shall be nameless except that her
initials is Betsy J that Ill jine the Meetin House at
Baldinsville jest as soon as I can scrape money enuff
together so I can ford to be piuss in good stile like my
welthy nabers But if Im confisticated agin Im fraid I
shall continner on in my present benited state for sum time

I figgered conspicyusly in many thrillin scenes in my tower
from Montgomry to my humsted and on sevril occasions I
thought the grate komick paper wouldnt be inriched no more
with my lubrications Arter biddin adoo to Jefferson D I
started for the depot I saw a nigger sittin on a fence a
playin on a banjo My Afrikan Brother sed I coting from a
Track I onct red you belong to a very interestin race Your
masters is goin to war excloosively on your account

Yes boss he replied an I wish em honorable graves
and he went on playin the banjo larfin all over and openin
his mouth wide enuff to drive in an oldfashioned 2 wheeled
chaise

The train of cars in which I was to trust my wallerable life
was the scaliest rickytiest lookin lot of consarns that I
ever saw on wheels afore What time does this string of
secondhand coffins leave I inquired of the depot master
He sed direckly and I went in  sot down I hadnt moren
fairly squatted afore a dark lookin man with a swinister
expression onto his countenance entered the cars and lookin
very sharp at me he axed what was my principles

Secesh I ansered Im a Dissoluter Im in favor of Jeff
Davis Bowregard Pickens Capt Kidd Bloobeard Munro
Edards the devil Mrs Cunningham and all the rest of em

Youre in favor of the war

Certingly By all means Im in favor of this war and also
of the next war Ive been in favor of the next war for over
sixteen years

War to the knife sed the man

Blud Eargo Blud sed I tho them words isnt orrigernal
with me them words was rit by Shakspeare who is ded His
mantle fell onto the author of The Seven Sisters whos goin
to hav a Spring overcoat made out of it

We got under way at larst an proceeded on our jerney at
about the rate of speed which is ginrally obsarved by
properlyconducted funeral processions A hansum yung gal
with a red musketer bar on the back side of her hed and a
sassy little black hat tipt over her forrerd sot in the seat
with me She wore a little Sesesh flag pind onto her hat
and she was a goin for to see her troo love who had jined the
Southern army all so bold and gay So she told me She was
chilly and I offered her my blanket

Father livin I axed

Yes sir

Got any Uncles

A heap Uncle Thomas is ded tho

Peace to Uncle Thomass ashes and success to him I will be
your Uncle Thomas Lean on me my pretty Secesher and linger
in Blissful repose She slept as secoorly as in her own
housen and didnt disturb the sollum stillness of the night
with ary snore

At the first station a troop of Sojers entered the cars and
inquired if Old Wax Works was on bored That was the
disrespectiv stile in which they referred to me Becawz if
Old Wax Works is on bored sez a man with a face like a
doublebreasted lobster were going to hang Old Wax Works

My illustrious and patriotic Bummers sez I a gittin up and
takin orf my Shappo if you allude to A Ward its my
pleasin dooty to inform you that hes ded He saw the error
of his ways at 15 minutes parst 2 yesterday and stabbed
hisself with a stuffed sledstake dyin in five beautiful
tabloos to slow moosic His last words was My perfeshernal
career is over I jerk no more

And who be you

Im a stoodent in Senator Benjamins law offiss Im going
up North to steal some spoons and things for the Southern
Army

This was satisfactory and the intossicated troopers went orf
At the next station the pretty little Secessher awoke and sed
she must git out there I bid her a kind adoo and giv her sum
pervisions Accept my blessin and this hunk of ginger bred
I sed She thankt me muchly and tript galy away Theres
considerable human nater in a man and Im afraid I shall
allers giv aid and comfort to the enemy if he cums to me in
the shape of a nice young gal

At the next station I didnt get orf so easy I was dragged
out of the cars and rolled in the mud for several minits for
the purpose of takin the conseet out of me as a Secesher
kindly stated

I was let up finally when a powerful large Secesher came up
and embraced me and to show that he had no hard feelins agin
me put his nose into my mouth I returned the compliment by
placin my stummick suddenly agin his right foot when he
kindly made a spittoon of his ablebodied face Actooated by
a desire to see whether the Secesher had bin vaxinated I then
fastened my teeth onto his left coatsleeve and tore it to the
shoulder We then vilently bunted out heads together for a
few minutes danced around a little and sot down in a
mudpuddle We riz to our feet agin and by a sudden and adroit
movement I placed my left eye agin the Seceshers fist We
then rushed into each others arms and fell under a twohoss
wagon I was very much exhaustid and didnt care about gettin
up agin but the man sed he reckoned Id better and I
conclooded I would He pulled me up but I hadnt bin on my
feet moren two seconds afore the ground flew up and hit me in
the hed The crowd sed it was high old sport but I couldnt
zackly see where the lafture come in I riz and we embraced
agin We careered madly to a steep bank when I got the upper
hands of my antaggernist and threw him into the raveen He
fell about forty feet striking a grindstone pretty hard I
understood he was injured I havent heard from the
grindstone

A man in a cockt hat cum up and sed he felt as though a
apology was doo me There was a mistake The crowd had taken
me for another man I told him not to mention it and axed
him if his wife and little ones was so as to be about and got
on bored the train which had stopped at that station 20
minits for refreshments I got all I wantid It was the
hartiest meal I ever et

I was rid on a rale the next day a bunch of blazin fire
crackers bein tied to my coat tales It was a fine spectycal
in a dramatic pint of view but I didnt enjoy it I had
other adventers of a startlin kind but why continner Why
lasserate the Public Boozum with these here things Suffysit
to say I got across Mason  Dixies line safe at last I made
tracks for my humsted but she to whom Im harnist for life
failed to recognize in the emashiated bein who stood before
her the gushin youth of fortysix summers who had left her
only a few months afore But I went into the pantry and
brought out a certin black bottle Raisin it to my lips I
sed Heres to you old gal I did it so natral that she
knowed me at once Those form Them voice That natral
stile of doin things Tis he she cried and rushed into my
arms It was too much for her  she fell into a swoon I cum
very near swoundin myself

No more today from yours for the Pepetration of the Union
and the bringin of the Goddess of Liberty out of her present
bad fix

Weathersfield is justly celebrated for her onyins and
patritism the world over and to be axed to paws and address
you on this my fust perfeshernal tower threw New Englan

Grate applaws They thought this was one of my
eccentricities while the fact is I was stuck This between
you and I

Im a plane man I dont know nothin about no ded languages
and am a little shaky on livin ones There4 expect no flowry
talk from me What I shall say will be to the pint right
strate out

Im not a politician and my other habits air good Ive no
enemys to reward nor friends to sponge But Im a Union man
I luv the Unionit is a Big thingand it makes my hart bleed

Im for the Union as she air and withered be the arm of every
ornery cuss who attempts to bust her up Thats me I hav
sed It was a very sweaty day and at this pint of the
orashun a man fell down with sunstroke I told the awjince
that considerin the large number of putty gals present I was
more afraid of a DAWTER STROKE This was impromptoo and
seemed to amoose them very much

Feller CitizensI haint got time to notis the growth of
Ameriky frum the time when the Mayflowers cum over in the
Pilgrim and brawt Plymouth Rock with them but every skool boy
nose our kareer has been tremenjis You will excuse me if I
dont prase the erly settlers of the Kolonies Peple which
hung idiotic old wimin for witches burnt holes in Quakers
tongues and consined their feller critters to the tredmill and
pillery on the slitest provocashun may hav bin very nice folks
in their way but I must confess I dont admire their stile
and will pass them by I spose they ment well and so in the
novel and techin langwidge of the nusepapers peas to their
ashis Thare was no diskount however on them brave men who
fit bled and died in the American Revolushun We neednt be
afraid of setting em up two steep Like my show they will
stand any amount of prase G Washington was abowt the best
man this world ever sot eyes on He was a clearheded
warmharted and stiddy goin man He never slopt over The
prevailin weakness of most public men is to SLOP OVER Put

see the multitood goin it blind they go Pel Mel with it
instid of exerting theirselves to set it right They cant
see that the crowd which is now bearin them triumfantly on its
shoulders will soon diskiver its error and cast them into the
hoss pond of Oblivyun without the slitest hesitashun
Washington never slopt over That wasnt Georges stile He
luved his country dearly He wasnt after the spiles He was
a human angil in a 3 kornerd hat and knee britches and we
shant see his like right away My frends we cant all be
Washingtons but we kin all be patrits  behave ourselves in a
human and a Christian manner When we see a brother goin down
hill to Ruin let us not give him a push but let us seeze rite
hold of his coat tails and draw him back to Morality

Imagine G Washington and P Henry in the character of

24 THE WAR FEVER IN BALDINSVILLE

As soon as Id recooperated my physikil system I went over
into the village The peasantry was glad to see me The
skoolmaster sed it was cheerin to see that gigantic intelleck
among em onct more Thats what he called me I like the
skoolmaster and allers send him tobacker when Im off on a
travelin campane Besides he is a very sensible man Such
men must be encouraged

They dont git news very fast in Baldinsville as nothin but a
plank road runs in there twice a week and thats very much
out of repair So my nabers wasnt much posted up in regard
to the wars Squire Baxter sed hed voted the dimicratic
ticket for goin on forty year and the war was a dam black
republican lie Jo Stackpole who kills hogs for the Squire
and has got a powerful muscle into his arms sed hed bet 5
dollars he could lick the Crisis in a fair standup fight if
he wouldnt draw a knife on him So it wentsum was for war
and sum was for peace The skoolmaster however sed the
Slave Oligarky must cower at the feet of the North ere a year
had flowed by or pass over his dead corpse Esto perpetua
he added And sine qua non also sed I sternly wishing to
make a impression onto the villagers Requiescat in pace
sed the skoolmaster Too troo too troo I anserd its a
scanderlus fact

The newspapers got along at last chock full of war and the
patriotic fever fairly bust out in Baldinsville Squire
Baxter sed he didnt blieve in Coercion not one of em and
could prove by a file of Eagles of Liberty in his garrit
that it was all a Whig lie got up to raise the price of
whisky and destroy our other liberties But the old Squire
got putty riley when he heard how the rebels was cuttin up
and he sed he reckoned he should skour up his old muskit and
do a little square fitin for the Old Flag which had allers
bin on the ticket HED voted and he was too old to Bolt now
The Squire is all right at heart but it takes longer for him
to fill his venerable Biler with steam than it used to when he
was young and frisky As I previously informed you I am
Captin of the Baldinsville Company I riz gradooally but
majestically from drummers Secretary to my present position
But I found the ranks wasnt full by no means and commenced
for to recroot Havin notist a gineral desire on the part of
young men who are into the crisis to wear eppylits I
detarmined to have my company composed excloosviely of
offissers everybody to rank as BrigadeerGinral The
follerin was among the varis questions which I put to
recroots

 Do you know a masked battery from a hunk of gingerbread

 Do you know a eppylit from a piece of chalk

 If I trust you with a real gun how many men of your own
company do you speck you can manage to kill durin the war

 Hav you ever heard of Ginral Price of Missouri and can you
avoid simler accidents in case of a battle

 Have you ever had the measles and if so how many

 How air you now

 Show me your tongue c c Sum of the questions was
sarcusstical

The company filled up rapid and last Sunday we went to the
meetin house in full uniform I had a seris time gittin into
my military harness as it was bilt for me many years ago but
I finally got inside of it tho it fitted me putty clost
Howsever onct into it I lookt finein fact awinspirin
Do you know me Mrs Ward sed I walking into the kitchin

Know you you old fool Of course I do

I saw at once she did

I started for the meetin house and Im afraid I tried to walk
too strate for I cum very near fallin over backards and in
attemptin to recover myself my sword got mixed up with my
legs and I fell in among a choice collection of young ladies
who was standin near the church door aseein the sojer boys
come up My cockt hat fell off and sumhow my coat tales got
twisted round my neck The young ladies put their
handkerchers to their mouths and remarked Te he while my
ancient female single friend Sary Peasley bust out in a loud
larf She exercised her mouth so vilently that her new false
teeth fell out onto the ground

Miss Peaseley sed I gittin up and dustin myself you must
be more careful with them store teeth of yourn or youll have
to gum it agin

Methinks I had her

Id bin to work hard all the week and I felt rather snoozy
Im fraid I did git half asleep for on hearin the minister
ask Why was man made to mourn I sed I giv it up havin
a vague idee that it was a condrum It was a onfortnit
remark for the whole meetin house lookt at me with mingled
surprise and indignation I was about risin to a pint of
order when it suddenly occurd to me whare I was and I kept
my seat blushin like the red red roseso to speak

The next mornin I rose with the lark NBI dont sleep
with the lark tho A goak

My little dawter was execootin ballids accompanyin herself
with the Akordeon and she wisht me to linger and hear her
sing Hark I hear a angel singin a angel now is onto the
wing

Let him fly my child sed I abucklin on my armer I must
forth to my Biz

We air progressin pretty well with our drill As all air
commandin offissers there aint no jelusy and as we air all
exceedin smart it taint worth while to try to outstrip each
other The idee of a company composed excloosively of
CommandersinChiefs orriggernated I spose I skurcely need
say in these Brane Considered AS a idee I flatter myself
it is putty hefty Weve got all the tackticks at our tongs
ends but what we particly excel in is restin muskits We can
rest muskits with anybody

Our corpse will do its dooty We go to the aid of Columbywe
fight for the stars

Well be chopt into sassige meat before well exhibit our
cotetales to the foe

Well fight till theres nothin left of us but our little toes
and even they shall defiantly wiggle

 Ever of thee
 A Ward


25 A WAR MEETING

Our complaint just now is war meetins Theyve bin havin em
bad in varis parts of our cheerful Republic and natrally we
caught em here in Baldinsville They broke out all over us
Theyre better attended than the Eclipse was

I remember how people poured into our town last Spring to see
the Eclipse They labored into a impression that they
couldnt see it to home and so they cum up to our place I
cleared a very handsome amount of money by exhibitin the
Eclipse to em in an opentop tent But the crowds is bigger
now Posey County is aroused I may say indeed that the
prahayories of Injianny is on fire

Our big meetin came off the other night and our old friend
of the Bugle was elected Cheerman

The BugleHorn of Liberty is one of Baldinsvilles most
eminentest institootions The advertisements are well
written and the deaths and marriages are conducted with
signal ability The editor MR SLINKERS is a polishd
skarcastic writer Folks in these parts will not soon forgit
how he used up the Eagle of Freedom a family journal
published at Snootville near here The controversy was about
a plank road The road may be as our cotemporary says a
humbug but OUR aunt isnt baldheded and WE havent got a
oneeyed sister Sal Wonder if the Editor of the Eagle of
Freedom sees it This used up the Eagle of Freedom
feller because his aunts head does present a skinnd
appearance and his sister SARAH is very much oneeyed For a
genteel homethrust MR SLINKERS has few ekals He is a man
of great pluck likewise He has a fierce nostril and I
believe upon my soul that if it wasnt absolootly necessary
for him to remain here and announce in his paper from week to
week that our Govment is about to take vigrous measures to
put down the rebellionI blieve upon my soul this
illustris man would enlist as a Brigadier Ginral and git his
Bounty
    

I was fixin myself up to attend the great war meetin when my
daughter entered with a young man who was evijently from the
city and who wore long hair and had a wild expression into
his eye In one hand he carried a portfolio and his other
paw claspt a bunch of small brushes My daughter introduced
him as MR SWEIBIER the distinguished landscape painter from
Philadelphy

He is a artist papa Here is one of his masterpiecesa
young mother gazin admirinly upon her firstborn and my
daughter showed me a really pretty picter done in ile Is
it not beautiful papa He throws so much soul into his
work

Does he does he said Iwell I reckon Id better hire
him to whitewash our fence It needs it What will you
charge sir I continued to throw some soul into my fence

My daughter went out of the room in very short meeter takin
the artist with her and from the emphatical manner in which
the door slamd I concluded she was summat disgusted at my
remarks She closed the door I may say in ITALICS I went
into the closet and larfed all alone by myself for over half
an hour I larfed so vilently that the preserve jars rattled
like a cavalry offissers sword and things which it aroused
my BETSY who came and opened the door pretty suddent She
seized me by the few lonely hairs that still linger sadly upon
my barefooted hed and dragged me out of the closet
incidentally obsarving that she didnt exactly see why she
should be compelled at her advanced stage of life to open a
assylum for sooperanooated idiots

My wife is one of the best wimin on this continent altho she
isnt always gentle as a lamb with mint sauce No not
always

But to return to the war meetin It was largely attended
The Editor of the Bugle arose and got up and said the fact
could no longer be disguised that we were involved in a war
Human gore said he is flowin All ablebodied men
should seize a musket and march to the tented field I repeat
it sir to the tented field

A voiceWhy dont you go yourself you old blowhard

I am identified young man with a Arkymedian leaver which
moves the world said the Editor wiping his auburn brow with
his left coattail I allude young man to the press
Terms two dollars a year invariably in advance Job
printing executed with neatness and dispatch And with this
brilliant bust of elekance the Editor introduced Mr J Brutus
Hinkins who is suffering from an attack of College in a
naberin place Mr Hinkins said Washington was not safe
Who can save our national capeetle

DAN SETCHELL I said He can do it afternoons Let him
plant his light and airy form onto the Long Bridge make faces
at the hirelin foe and theyll skedaddle Old SETCH can do
it

I call the Napoleon of Showmen said the Editor of the
BugleI call that Napoleonic man whose life is adorned
with so many noble virtues and whose giant mind lights up
this warlike sceneI call him to order

I will remark in this connection that the Editor of the
Bugle does my job printing

You said Mr Hinkins who live away from the busy haunts
of men do not comprehend the magnitood of the crisis The
busy haunts of men is where people comprehend this crisis We
who live in the busy haunts of menthat is to say we dwell
as it were in the busy haunts of men

I really trust that the genlman will not fail to say
suthin about the busy haunts of men before he sits down
said I

I claim the right to express my sentiments here said Mr
Hinkins in a slightly indignant tone and I shall brook no
interruption if I am a Softmore

You couldnt be MORE SOFT my young friend I observed
whereupon there was cries of Order order

I regret I cant mingle in this strife personally said the
young man

You might inlist as a libertypole said I in a silvery
whisper

But he added I have a voice and that voice is for war
The young man then closed his speech with some strikin and
orginal remarks in relation to the starspangled banner He
was followed by the village minister a very worthy man
indeed but whose sermons have a tendency to make people sleep
pretty industriously

I am willin to inlist for one he said

Whats your weight parson I asked

A hundred and sixty pounds he said

Well you can inlist as a hundred and sixty pounds of
morphine your dooty bein to stand in the hospitals arter a
battle and preach while the surgical operations is bein
performed Think how much youd save the Govment in
morphine

He didnt seem to see it but he made a good speech and the
editor of the Bugle rose to read the resolutions commencin
as follers

RESOLVED That we view with anxiety the fact that there is now
a war goin on and

RESOLVED That we believe Stonewall Jackson sympathizes with
the secession movement and that we hope the ninemonths men

At this point he was interrupted by the sounds of silvery
footsteps on the stairs and a party of wimin carryin guns
and led by BETSY JANE who brandishd a loud and rattlin
umbereller burst into the room

Here cried I are some ninemonths wimin

Mrs Ward said the editor of the BugleMrs WARD and
ladies what means this extrordnry demonstration

It means said that remarkable female that you men air
makin fools of yourselves You air willin to talk and urge
others to go to the wars but you dont go to the wars
yourselves War meetins is very nice in their way but they
dont keep STONEWALL JACKSON from comin over to Maryland and
helpin himself to the fattest beef critters What we want is
more cider and less talk We want you ablebodied men to stop
speechifying which dont mount to the wiggle of a sick cats
tail and to go fitin otherwise you can stay to home and
take keer of the children while we wimin will go to the
wars

Gentlman said I thats my wife Go in old gal and I
throwd up my ancient white hat in perfeck rapters

Is this rollbook to be filled up with the names of men or
wimin she cried

With menwith men and our quoty was made up that very
night

There is a great deal of gas about these war meetins A war
meetin in fact without gas would be suthin like the play
of HAMLET with the part of OTHELLO omitted

Still believin that the Goddess of Liberty is about as well
sot up with as any young lady in distress could expect to be
I am
 Yours moren anybody elses
 A Ward

My only daughter threw herself onto my boosum and said It

My wife was to the sowin circle I knew she and the wimin

OTHER sowin circle which likewise met that arternoon and
was doubtless enjoyin theirselves ekally well in slanderin
the fustnamed circle and I didnt send for her I allus
like to see people enjoy theirselves

My son ORGUSTUS was playin onto a floot

ORGUSTUS is a ethereal cuss The twins was bildin cobhouses
in a corner of the kitchin

Itll cost some postagestamps to raise this famly and yet
it ud go hard with the old man to lose any lamb of the flock

An old bachelor is a poor critter He may have hearn the
skylark or whats nearly the same thing MISS KELLOGG and
CARLOTTY PATTI sing he may have hearn OLE BULL fiddle and
all the DODWORTHS toot an yet he dont know nothin about

happy wellfed children And you may ax the father of sich
children home to dinner feelin werry sure therell be no
spoons missin when he goes away Sich fathers never drop tin
fivecent pieces into the contribution box nor palm shoepegs
off onto blind hosses for oats nor skedaddle to British sile
when their countrys in dangernor do anything which is
really mean I dont mean to intimate that the old bachelor
is up to little games of this sortnot at allbut I repeat
hes a poor critter He dont live here only stays He
ought to pologize on behalf of his parients for bein here
at all The happy marrid man dies in good stile at home
surrounded by his weeping wife and children The old bachelor
dont die at allhe sort of rots away like a pollywogs
tail
    

My townsmen were sort o demoralized There was a evident
desine to ewade the Draft as I obsarved with sorrer and
patritism was below Parand MAR too A jew desprit I
hadnt no sooner sot down on the piazzy of the tavoun than I
saw sixteen solitary hossmen ridin four abreast wendin
their way up the street

Whats them Is it cavilry

That said the landlord is the stage Sixteen ablebodied
citizens has literally bot the stage line tween here and
Scotsburg Thats them Theyre Stagedrivers Stage
drivers is exempt

I saw that each stagedriver carried a letter in his left
hand

The mail is hevy today said the landlord Ginrally
they dont have moren half a dozen letters tween em To
day theyre got one a piece Bile my lights and liver

And the passengers

There aint any skacely nowdays said the landlord and
what few ther is very much prefer to walk the roads is so
rough

And how ist with you I inquired of the editor of the
BugleHorn of Liberty who sot near me

I cant go he said shakin his head in a wise way
Ordinarily I should delight to wade in gore but my bleedin
country bids me stay at home It is imperatively necessary
that I remain here for the purpose of announcin from week to
week that OUR GOVMENT IS ABOUT TO TAKE VIGOROUS MEASURES TO
PUT DOWN THE REBELLION

I strolled into the village oystersaloon where I found Dr
SCHWAZEY a leadin citizen in a state of mind which showed
that hed bin histin in moren his share of pizen

Hello old Beeswax he bellered hows yer grandmams When
you goin to feed your stuffed animils

Whats the matter with the eminent physician I pleasantly
inquired

This he said this is whats the matter Im a habitooal
drunkard Im exempt

Jes so

Do you see them beans old man and he pinted to a plate
before him Do you see em

I do They are a cheerful fruit when used tempritly

Well said he I hadnt eat anything since last week I
eat beans now BECAUSE I eat beans THEN I never mix my
vittles

Its quite proper you should eat a little suthin once in a
while I said Its a good idee to occasionally instruct
the stummick that it mustnt depend excloosively on licker for
its sustainance

A blessin he cried a blessin onto the hed of the man
what invented beans A blessin onto his hed

Which his name is GILSON Hes a first family of Bostin
said I
    

This is a speciment of how things was goin in my place of
residence
    

A few was true blue The schoolmaster was among em He
greeted me warmly He said I was welkim to those shores He
said I had a massiv mind It was gratifyin he said to see
the great intelleck stalkin in their midst onct more I have
before had occasion to notice this schoolmaster He is
evidently a young man of far more than ordnary talents

The schoolmaster proposed we should git up a mass meetin
The meetin was largely attended We held it in the open air
round a roarin bonfire

The schoolmaster was the first orator Hes pretty good on
the speak He also writes well his composition bein seldom
marred by ingrammatticisms He said this inactivity surprised
him What do you expect will come of this kind of doins
Nihil fit

Hooray for Nihil I interrupted Fellowcitizens lets
giv three cheers for Nihil the man who fit

The schoolmaster turned a little red but repeatedNihil
fit

Exactly I said Nihil FIT He wasnt a strategy feller

Our venerable friend said the schoolmaster smilin
pleasantly isnt posted in Virgil

No I dont know him But if hes a ablebodied man he must
stand his little draft

The schoolmaster wound up in eloquent style and the
subscriber took the stand

I said the crisis had not only cum itself but it had brought
all its relations It has cum I said with a evident
intention of makin us a good long visit Its goin to take
off its things and stop with us My wife says so too This
is a good war For those who like this war its just such a
kind of war as they like Ill bet ye My wife says so too
If the Federal army succeeds in takin Washington and they
seem to be advancin that way pretty often I shall say it is
strategy and Washington will be safe And that noble banner
as it werethat banner as it werewill be a emblem or
rather I should say that noble bannerAS IT WERE My wife
says so too I got a little mixed up here but they didnt
notice it Keep mum Feller citizens it will be a proud
day for this Republic when Washington is safe My wife says
so too

The editor of the BugleHorn of Liberty here arose and said
I do not wish to interrupt the gentleman but a impertant
despatch has just bin received at the telegraph office here
I will read it It is as follows GOVMENT IS ABOUT TO TAKE
VIGOROUS MEASURES TO PUT DOWN THE REBELLION Loud applause

That said I is cheering Thats soothing And Washington
will be safe Sensation Philadelphia is safe Gen
PATTERSONS in Philadelphia But my heart bleeds particly
for Washington My wife says so too

Theres money enough No trouble about MONEY Theyve got a
lot of firstclass banknote engravers at Washington which
place I regret to say is by no means safe who turn out two
or three cords of money a daygood money too Goes well
These banknote engravers made good wages I expect they lay
up property They are full of Union sentiment There is
considerable Union sentiment in Virginny more especially
among the honest farmers of the Shenandoah valley My wife
says so too

Then it isnt money we want But we do want MEN and we must
have them We must carry a whirlwind of fire among the foe
We must crush the ungrateful rebels who are poundin the
Goddess of Liberty over the head with slungshots and
stabbin her with stolen knives We must lick em quick We
must introduce a large number of firstclass funerals among
the people of the South Betsy says so too

This war haint been too well managed We all know that
What then We are all in the same boatif the boat goes
down we go down with her Hence we must all fight It aint
no use to talk now about who CAUSED the war Thats played
out The war is upon usupon us alland we must all fight
We cant reason the matter with the foe When in the broad
glare of the noonday sun a speckled jackass boldly and
maliciously kicks over a peanutstand do we reason with
him I guess not And why reason with those other Southern
people who are trying to kick over the Republic Betsy my
wife says so too

The meeting broke up with enthusiasm

We shant draft in Baldinsville if we can help it


27 SURRENDER OF CORNWALLIS

It was customary in many of the inland towns of New England
some thirty years ago to celebrate the anniversary of the
surrender of Lord Cornwallis by a sham representation of that
important event in the history of the Revolutionary War A
town meeting would be called at which a company of men would
be detailed as British and a company as Americanstwo
leading citizens being selected to represent Washington and
Cornwallis in mimic surrender

The pleasant little town of W in whose schools the writer
has been repeatedly corrected upon whose ponds he has often
skated upon whose richest orchards he has with other
juvenile bandits many times dashed in the silent midnight
the town of W where it was popularly believed these bandits
would come to a bad end resolved to celebrate the
surrender Rival towns had celebrated and W determined to
eclipse them in the most signal manner It is my privilege to
tell how W succeeded in this determination

The great day came It was ushered in by the roar of
musketry the ringing of the village church bell the
squeaking of fifes and the rattling of drums

People poured into the village from all over the county
Never had W experienced such a jam Never had there been
such an onslaught upon gingerbread carts Never had New
England rum for this was before Neal Dows day flowed so
freely And Ws fair daughters who mounted the housetops
to see the surrender had never looked fairer The old folks
came too and among them were several warscarred heroes who
had fought gallantly at Monmouth and Yorktown These brave
sons of 76 took no part in the demonstration but an honored
bench was set apart for their exclusive use on the piazza of
Sile Smiths store When they were dry all they had to do was
to sing out to Siles boy Jerry a leetle New Englan this
way if YOU please It was brought forthwith

At precisely 9 oclock by the schoolmasters new Lepeen
watch the American and British forces marched on to the
village green and placed themselves in battle array reminding
the spectator of the time when

 Brave Wolfe drew up his men
 In a style most pretty
 On the Plains of Abraham
 Before the city

The character of Washington had been assigned to Squire Wood
a welltodo and influential farmer while that of Cornwallis
had been given to the village lawyer a kindhearted but
rather pompous person whose name was Caleb Jones

Squire Wood the Washington of the occasion had met with
many unexpected difficulties in preparing his forces and in
his perplexity he had emptied not only his own canteen but
those of most of his aids The consequence wasmortifying as
it must be to all true Americansblushing as I do to tell it
Washington at the commencement of the mimic struggle was most
unqualifiedly drunk

The sham fight commenced Bang bang bang from the
Americansbang bang bang from the British The bangs were
kept hotly up until the powder gave out and then came the
order to charge Hundreds of wooden bayonets flashed fiercely
in the sunlight each soldier taking very good care not to hit
anybody

Thaz hic right shouted Washington who during the
shooting had been racing his horse wildly up and down the
line thaz right GIN it to em Cut their tarnal heads
off

On Romans shrieked Cornwallis who had once seen a
theatrical performance and remembered the heroic appeals of
the Thespian belligerents on to the fray No sleep till
mornin

Let eout all their bowels yelled Washington and down with
taxation on tea

The fighting now ceased the opposing forces were properly
arranged and Cornwallis dismounting prepared to present his
sword to Washington according to programme As he walked
slowly towards the Father of His Country he rehearsed the
little speech he had committed for the occasion while the
illustrious being who was to hear it was making desperate
efforts to keep in his saddle Now he would wildly brandish
his sword and narrowly escape cutting off his horses ears
and then he would fall suddenly forward on to the steeds
neck grasping the mane as drowning men seize hold of straws
He was giving an inimitable representation of Toodles on
horseback All idea of the magnitude of the occasion had left
him and when he saw Cornwallis approaching with slow and
stately step and swordhilt extended toward him he inquired

Whatn devil YOU want any hic how

General Washington said Cornwallis in dignified and
impressive tones I tender you my sword I need not inform
you Sir how deeply

The speech was here suddenly cut short by Washington who
driving the spurs into his horse playfully attempted to ride
over the commander of the British forces He was not
permitted to do this for his aids seeing his unfortunate
condition seized the horse by the bridle straightened
Washington up in his saddle and requested Cornwallis to
proceed with his remarks

General Washington said Cornwallis the British Lion
prostrates himself at the feet of the American Eagle

EAGLE EAGLE yelled the infuriated Washington rolling off
his horse and hitting Cornwallis a frightful blow on the head
with the flat of his sword do you call me a EAGLE you mean
sneakin cuss He struck him again sending him to the
ground and said Ill learn you to call me a Eagle you
infernal scoundrel

Cornwallis remained upon the ground only a moment Smarting
from the blows he had received he arose with an entirely
unlooked for recuperation on the part of the fallen and in
direct defiance of historical example in spite of the men of
both nations indeed he whipped the Immortal Washington until
he roared for mercy

The Americans at first mortified and indignant at the conduct
of their chief now began to sympathize with him and resolved
to whip their mock foes in earnest They rushed fiercely upon
them but the British were really the stronger party and drove
the Americans back Not content with this they charged madly
upon them and drove them from the fieldfrom the village in
fact There were many heads damaged eyes draped in mourning
noses fractured and legs lamedit is a wonder that no one was
killed outright

Washington was confined to his house for several weeks but he
recovered at last For a time there was a coolness between
himself and Cornwallis but they finally concluded to join the
whole county in laughing about the surrender

They live now Time the artist has thoroughly whitewashed
their heads but they are very jolly still On town meeting
days the old Squire always rides down to the village In the
hind part of his venerable yellow wagon is always a bunch of
hay ostensibly for the old white horse but really to hide a
glass bottle from the vulgar gaze This bottle has on one
side a likeness of Lafayette and upon the other may be seen
the Goddess of Liberty What the bottle contains inside I
cannot positively say but it is true that Squire Wood and
Lawyer Jones visit that bottle very frequently on townmeeting
days and come back looking quite red in the face When this
redness in the face becomes of the blazing kind as it
generally does by the time the polls close a short dialogue
like this may be heard

We shall never play surrender again Lawyer Jones

Them days is over Squire Wood


28 THINGS IN NEW YORK

The stoodent and connyseer must have noticed and admired in
varis parts of the United States of America large yeller
hanbills which not only air gems of art in theirselves but
they troothfully sit forth the attractions of my showa show
let me here obsarve that contains many livin wild animils
every one of which has got a Beautiful Moral

Them hanbills is sculpt in New York

 I annoolly repair here to git some more on um

 bein here I thot Id issoo a Adress to the public on
matters and things

Since last I meyandered these streets I have bin all over the
Pacific Slopes and Utah I cum back now with my virtoo
unimpaired but Ive got to git some new clothes

Many changes has taken place even durin my short absence 
sum on um is Sollum to contempulate The house in Varick
street where I used to Board is bein torn down That
house which was rendered memoriable by my livin into it is
parsin away parsin away But some of the timbers will be
made into canes which will be sold to my admirers at the low
price of one dollar each Thus is changes goin on
continerly In the New World it is warin the Old World
Empires is totterin  Dysentaries is crumblin These canes
is cheap at a dollar

Sammy Booth Duane street sculps my hanbills  hes artist
He studid in RomeState of New York

Im here to read the proofsheets of my hanbils as fast as
theyre sculpt You have to watch these ere printers pretty
close for theyre jest as apt to spel a wurd rong as anyhow

But I have time to look around sum  how do I find things I
return to the Atlantic States after a absence of ten months 
what State do I find the country in Why I dont know what
State I find it in Suffice it to say that I do not find it
in the State of New Jersey

I find sum things that is cheerin particly the resolve on
the part of the wimin of America to stop wearin furrin goods

I never meddle with my wifes things She may wear muslin
from Greenlands icy mountains and bombazeen from Injys
coral strands if she wants to but Im glad to state that
that superior woman has peeled off all her furrin clothes and
jumpt into fabrics of domestic manufactur

But says sum folks if you stop importin things you stop the
revenoo Thats all right We can stand it if the Revenoo
can On the same principle young men should continer to get
drunk on French brandy and to smoke their livers as dry as a
corncob with Cuby cigars because 4sooth if they dont it
will hurt the Revenoo This talk bout the Revenoo is of the
bosh boshy One thing is tolbly certinif we dont send
gold out of the country we shall have the consolation of
knowing that it is in the country So I say great credit is
doo the wimin for this patriotic moveand to tell the trooth
the wimin genrally know what theyre bout Of all the
blessins theyre the soothinist If thered never bin any
wimin where would my children be today

But I hope this move will lead to other moves that air just as
much needed one of which is a genral and therrer curtainment
of expenses all round The fact is we air gettin terbly
extravgant and onless we paws in our mad career in less than
two years the Goddess of Liberty will be seen dodgin into a
Pawn Brokers shop with the other gown done up in a bundle
even if she dont have to Spout the gold stars in her
headband Let us all take hold jintly and live and dress
centsibly like our forefathers who knowd moren we do if
they warnt quite so honest Suttle goaketh

There air other cheerin signs for Ameriky We dont for
instuns lack great Genrals and we certinly dont brave
sojersbut theres one thing I wish we did lack and that is
our present Congress

I venture to say that if you sarch the earth all over with a
tenhoss power mikriscope you wont be able to find such
another pack of poppycock gabblers as the present Congress of
the United States of America would be able to findfind among
their constituents

Gentleman of the Senit  of the House youve sot there and
drawd your pay and made summercomplaint speeches long enuff
The country at large incloodin the undersined is disgusted
with you Why dont you show us a statesmansumbody who can
make a speech that will hit the poplar hart right under the
great Public weskit Why dont you show us a statesman who
can rise up to the Emergency and cave in the Emergencys
head

Congress you wont do Go home you mizzerable devilsgo
home

At a special Congressional lection in my district the other
day I delibritly voted for Henry Clay I admit that Henry is
dead but inasmuch as we dont seem to have a live statesman
in our National Congress let us by all means have a first
class corpse

Them who think that a cane made from the timbers of the house
I once boarded in is essenshall to their happiness should not
delay about sendin the money right on for one

My reported captur by the North American savijis of Utah led
my wide circle of friends and creditors to think that I had
bid adoo to earthly things and was a angel playin on a golden
harp Hents my rival home was on expected

It was 11 PM when I reached my homestid and knockt a
healthy knock on the door thereof

A nightcap thrusted itself out of the front chamber winder
It was my Betsys nightcap And a voice said

Who is it

It is a Man I answered in a gruff vois

I dont blieve it she sed

Then come down and search me I replied

Then resumin my natral voice I said It is your own A W
Betsy Sweet lady wake Ever of thou

Oh she said its you is it I thought I smelt
something

But the old girl was glad to see me

In the mornin I found that my family were entertainin a
artist from Philadelphy who was there paintin some startlin
waterfalls and mountains and I morin suspected he had a
hankerin for my oldest dauter

Mr Skimmerhorn father sed my dauter

Glad to see you Sir I replied in a hospittle voisGlad
to see you

He is an artist father sed my child

A whichist

An artist A painter

And glazier I askt Air you a painter and glazier sir

My dauter and wife was mad but I couldnt help it I felt in
a comikil mood

It is a wonder to me Sir sed the artist considerin what
a widespread reputation you have that some of our Eastern
managers dont secure you

Its a wonder to me said I to my wife that somebody dont
secure him with a chain

After breakfast I went over to town to see my old friends
The editor of the Bugle greeted me cordyully and showed me
the follerin article hed just written about the paper on the
other side of the street

We have recently put up in our office an entirely new sink
of unique constructionwith two holes through which the
soiled water may pass to the new bucket underneath What will
the hellhounds of The Advertiser say to this We shall
continue to make improvements as fast as our rapidly
increasing business may warrant Wonder whether a certain
editors wife thinks she can palm off a brass watchchain on
this community for a gold one

That says the Editor hits him whar he lives That will
close him up as bad as it did when I wrote an article
ridicooling his sister whos got a cockeye

A few days after my return I was shown a young man who says
hell be Dam if he goes to the war He was settin on a
barrel and was indeed a Loathsum objeck

Last Sunday I heard Parson Batkins preach and the good old
man preached well too tho his prayer was ruther lengthy
The Editor of the Bugle who was with me sed that prayer
would make fifteen squares solid nonparil

I dont think of nothin more to write about So Bleeve me
if all those endearing young charms c c

210 IN CANADA

Im at present existin under a monikal form of Govment In
other words Im travellin among the crowned heds of Canady
They aint pretty bad people On the contry they air
exceedin good people

Troo they air deprived of many blessins They dont enjoy
for instans the priceless boon of a war They havent any
American Egil to onchain and they haint got a Fourth of July
to their backs

Altho this is a monikal form of Govment I am onable to
perceeve much moniky I tried to git a piece in Toronto but
failed to succeed

Mrs VICTORIA who is Queen of England and has all the
luxuries of the markets includin game in its season dont
bother herself much about Canady but lets her do bout as
shes mighter She however ginrally keeps her supplied
with a lord whos called a Govner Ginral Sometimes the
politicians of Canady make it lively for this lordfor Canady
has politicians and I expect they dont differ from our
politicians some of em bein gifted and talented liars no
doubt

The present Govner Ginral of Canady is Lord MONK I saw him
review some volunteers at Montreal He was accompanied by
some other lords and dukes and generals and those sort of
things He rode a little bay horse and his close wasnt any
better than mine Youll always notiss by the way that the
higher up in the world a man is the less good harness he puts
on Hence Ginral HALLECK walks the streets in plain
citizens dress while the second lieutenant of a volunteer
regiment piles all the brass things he can find onto his back
and drags a fortypound sword after him

Monk has been in the lord bisniss some time and I understand
it pays tho I dont know what a lords wages is The wages
of sin is death and postage stamps But this has nothing to
do with MONK

One of Lord MONKS daughters rode with him on the field She
has golden hair a kind good face and wore a red hat I
should be very happy to have her pay me and my family a visit
at Baldinsville Come and bring your knittin Miss MONK
Mrs WARD will do the fair thing by you She makes the best
slapjacks in America As a slapjackist she has no ekal
She wears the Belt

What the review was all about I dont know I havent a
gigantic intelleck which can grasp great questions at onct
I am not a WEBSTER or a SEYMOUR I am not a WASHINGTON or a
OLD ABE Fur from it I am not as gifted a man as HENRY WARD
BEECHER Even the congregation of Plymouth MeetinHouse in
Brooklyn will admit that Yes I should think so But while
I dont have the slitest idee as to what the review was fur I
will state that the sojers looked pooty scrumptious in their
red and green close

Come with me jentle reader to Quebeck Quebeck was surveyed
and laid out by a gentleman who had been afflicted with the
delirium tremens from childhood and hence his idees of things
was a little irregler The streets dont lead anywheres in
particler but everywheres in ginral The city is bilt on a
variety of perpendicler hills each hill bein a trifle wuss
nor tother one Quebeck is full of stone walls and arches
and citadels and things It is said no foe could ever git
into Quebeck and I guess they couldnt And I dont see what
theyd WANT to get in there for

Quebeck has seen lively times in a warlike way The French
and Britishers had a setto there in 1759 JIM WOLFE
commanded the latters and JO MONTCALM the formers Both
were hunky boys and fit nobly But WOLFE was too many
measles for MONTCALM and the French was slewd WOLFE and
MONTCALM was both killed In arter years a common monyment
was erected by the genrous people of Quebeck aided by a
bully Earl named GEORGE DALHOUSIE to these noble fellows
That was well done

Durin the Revolutionary War B ARNOLD made his way through
dense woods and thick snows from Maine to Quebeck which it
was one of the hunkiest things ever done in the military line
It would have been better if B ARNOLDS funeral had come off
immeditly on his arrival there

On the Plains of Abraham there was onct some tall fitin and
ever since then there has been a great demand for the bones of
the slewd on that there occasion But the real ginooine
bones was long ago carried off and now the boys make a hansum
thing by cartin the bones of hosses and sheep out there and
sellin em to intelligent American towerists Takin a
perfessional view of this dodge I must say that it betrays
genius of a lorfty character

It reminded me of a inspired feet of my own I used to
exhibit a wax figger of HENRY WILKINS the Boy Murderer
HENRY had in a moment of inadvertence killed his Uncle
EPHRAM and walked off with the old mans money Well this
stattoo was lost somehow and not sposin it would make any
particler difference I substitooted the fullgrown stattoo of
one of my distinguished piruts for the Boy Murderer One
night I exhibited to a poor but honest audience in the town of
Stoneham Maine This ladies and gentlemen said I
pointing my umbrella that weapon which is indispensable to
every troo American to the stattoo this is a lifelike wax
figger of the notorious HENRY WILKINS who in the dead of
night murdered his Uncle EPHRAM in cold blood A sad warning
to all uncles havin murderers for nephews When a mere child
this HENRY WILKINS was compelled to go to the Sundayschool
He carried no Sundayschool book The teacher told him to go
home and bring one He went and returned with a comic song
book A depraved proceedin

But says a man in the audience when you was here before
your wax figger represented HENRY WILKINS as a boy Now
HENRY was hung and yet you show him to us now as a fullgrown
man Hows that

The figger has growd sirit has growd I said

I was angry If it had been in these times I think I should
have informed agin him as a traitor to his flag and had him
put in Fort Lafayette

I say adoo to Quebeck with regret It is oldfogyish but
chockfull of interest Young gentlemen of a romantic turn of
mind who air botherin their heads as to how they can spend
their fathers money had better see Quebeck

Altogether I like Canady Good people and lots of pretty
girls I wouldnt mind comin over here to live in the
capacity of a Duke provided a vacancy occurs and provided
further I could be allowed a few starspangled banners a
eagle a boon of liberty etc

Dont think Ive skedaddled Not at all Im coming home in
a week

Lets have the Union restored as it was if we can but if we
cant IM IN FAVOR OF THE UNION AS IT WASNT But the Union
anyhow

Gentlemen of the editorial corpse if you would be happy be
virtoous I who am the emblem of virtoo tell you so

211 THE NOBLE RED MAN

The red man of the forest was formly a very respectful
person Justice to the noble aboorygine warrants me in sayin
that orrigernerly he was a majestic cuss

At the time CHRIS arrove on these shores I allood to CHRIS
COLUMBUS the savajis was virtoous and happy They were
innocent of secession rum drawpoker and sinfulness
ginrally They didnt discuss the slavery question as a
custom They had no Congress faro banks delirium tremens
or Associated Press Their habits was consequently good
Late suppers dyspepsy gas companies thieves ward
politicians pretty waitergirls and other metropolitan
refinements were unknown among them No savage in good
standing would take postagestamps You couldnt have bot a
coonskin with a barrel of em The female Aboorygine never
died of consumption because she didnt tie her waist up in
whalebone things but in loose and flowin garments she
bounded with naked feet over hills and plains like the wild
and frisky antelope It was a onlucky moment for us when
CHRIS sot his foot onto these ere shores It would have
been better for us of the present day if the injins had given
him a warm meal and sent him home ore the ragin billers For
the savages owned the country and COLUMBUS was a fillibuster
CORTEZ PIZARRO and WALKER were onehorse fillibusters
COLUMBUS was a fourhorse team fillibuster and a large yaller
dog under the waggin I say in view of the mess we are
makin of things it would have been better for us if cOLUMBUS
had staid to home It would have been better for the show
bisniss The circulation of Vanity Fair would be larger
and the proprietors would all have boozum pins Yes sir and
perhaps a tenpin alley

By which I dont wish to be understood as intimatin that the
scalpin wretches who are in the injin bisness at the present
day are of any account or calculated to make home happy
specially the Sioxes of Minnesoty who desarve to be murdered
in the first degree and if POPE will only stay in St Paul
and not go near em HIMSELF I reckon they will be


212 ARTEMUS WARD IN RICHMOND

 OLONZO WARD

Afore I comments this letter from the late rebil capitol I

that name but I do not recugnize him now To me he is wuss
than ded I took him from collige sum 16 years ago and gave
him a good situation as the Bearded Woman in my Show How did
he repay me for this kindness He basely undertook one day
while in a Backynalian mood on rum  right in sight of the
aujience in the tent to stand upon his hed whareby he
betrayd his sex on account of his boots  his Beard fallin
off his face thus rooinin my prospecks in that town 
likewise incurrin the seris displeasure of the Press which
sed boldly I was triflin with the feelins of a intelligent
public I know no such man as Olonzo Ward I do not even
wish his name breathed in my presents I do not recognize
him I perfectly disgust him

 RICHMOND

The old man finds hisself once more in a Sunny climb I cum
here a few days arter the city catterpillertulated

My naburs seemed surprised  astonisht at this darin bravery
onto the part of a man at my time of life but our family was
never knowd to quale in dangers stormy hour

My father was a sutler in the Revolootion War My father once
had a intervoo with Ginral La Fayette

He asked La Fayette to lend him five dollars promisin to pay
him in the Fall but Lafy said he couldnt see it in those
lamps Lafy was French and his knowledge of our langwidge
was a little shaky

Immejutly on my rival here I perceeded to the Spotswood
House and callin to my assistans a young man from our town
who writes a good runnin hand I put my ortograph on the
Register and handin my umbrella to a baldheded man behind
the counter who I sposed was Mr Spotswood I said Spotsy

He called a cullud purson and said

My brother I sed air you aware that youve bin
mancipated Do you realize how glorus it is to be free Tell
me my dear brother does it not seem like some dreams or do
you realize the great fact in all its livin and holy
magnitood

He sed he would take some gin

I was showd to the cowyard and laid down under a onemule
cart The hotel was orful crowded and I was sorry I hadnt
gone to the Libby Prison Tho I should hav slept comfble
enuff if the bedclothes hadnt bin pulled off me durin the
night by a scoundrul who cum and hitched a mule to the cart
and druv it off I thus lost my cuverin and my throat feels
a little husky this mornin

Ginral Hulleck offers me the hospitality of the city givin
me my choice of hospitals

He has also very kindly placed at my disposal a smallpox
amboolance

 UNION SENTIMENT

There is raly a great deal of Union sentiment in this city I
see it on evry hand

I met a man todayI am not at liberty to tell his name but
he is a old and inflooentooial citizen of Richmond and sez
he Why Weve bin fightin agin the Old Flag Lor bless
me how singlar He then borrerd five dollars of me and
bust into a flood of teers

Sed another a man of standin and formerly a bitter rebuel
Let us at once stop this effooshun of Blud The Old Flag is
good enuff for me Sir he added you air from the North
Have you a doughnut or a piece of custard pie about you

I told him no but I knew a man from Vermont who had just
organized a sort of restaurant where he could go and make a
very comfortable breakfast on New England rum and cheese He
borrowed fifty cents of me and askin me to send him Wm
Lloyd Garrisons ambrotype as soon as I got home he walked
off

Said another Theres bin a tremendous Union feelin here from
the fust But we was kept down by a rain of terror Have you
a dagerretype of Wendell Phillips about your person and will
you lend me four dollars for a few days till we air once more
a happy and united people

 JEFF DAVIS

Jeff Davis is not poplar here She is regarded as a
Southern sympathizer  yit Im told he was kind to his
Parents She ran away from em many years ago and has never
bin back This was showin em a good deal of consideration
when we refleck what his conduck has been Her captur in
female apparel confooses me in regard to his sex  you see I
speak of him as a her as frekent as otherwise  I guess he
feels so hisself

 R LEE

Robert Lee is regarded as a noble feller

He was opposed to the war at the fust and drawd his sword
very reluctant In fact he wouldnt hav drawd his sword at
all only he had a large stock of military clothes on hand
which he didnt want to waste He sez the colored man is
right and he will at once go to New York and open a Sabbath
School for negro minstrels

 THE CONFEDERATE ARMY

The surrender of R Lee J Johnston and others leaves the
Confedrit Army in a ruther shattered state That army now
consists of Kirby Smith four mules and a Bass drum and is
movin rapidly tords Texis

 A PROUD AND HAWTY SUTHENER

Feelin a little peckish I went into a eatin house today
and encountered a young man with long black hair and slender
frame He didnt wear much clothes and them as he did wear
looked onhealthy He frowned on me and sed kinder scornful
So Siryou come here to taunt us in our hour of trouble do
you

No said I I cum here for hash

Pishhaw he sed sneerinly I mean you air in this city for
the purposes of gloating over a fallen people Others may
basely succumb but as for me I will never yieldNEVER
NEVER

Tripe and onions he sed furcely then he added I eat with
you but I hate you Youre a lowlived Yankee

To which I pleasantly replied Howl you have your tripe

Fried mudsill with plenty of hamfat

He et very ravenus Poor feller He had lived on odds and
ends for several days eatin crackers that had bin turned
over by revelers in the bread tray at the bar

He got full at last and his hart softened a little toards
me After all he sed you have sum people at the North
who air not wholly loathsum beasts

Well yes I sed we hav now and then a man among us who
isnt a coldbluded scoundril Young man I mildly but
gravely sed this crooil war is over and youre lickt Its
rather necessary for sumbody to lick in a good square lively
fite and in this ere case it happens to be the United States
of America You fit splendid but we was too many for you
Then make the best of it  let us all give in and put the
Republic on a firmer basis nor ever

I dont gloat over your misfortuns my young fren Fur from
it Im a old man now  my hart is softer nor it once was
You see my spectacles is mistend with suthin very like
tears Im thinkin of the sea of good rich Blud that has
been spilt on both sides in this dredful war Im thinkin of
our widders and orfuns North and of yourn in the South I
kin cry for both Bleeve me my young fren I kin place my
old hands tenderly on the fair yung hed of the Virginny maid
whose lover was laid low in the battle dust by a fedral
bullet and say as fervently and piously as a venerble
sinner like me kin say anythin God be good to you my poor
dear my poor dear

I riz up to go  takin my young Southern fren kindly by the
hand I sed Yung man adoo You Southern fellers is probly
my brothers tho youve occasionally had a cussed queer way
of showin it Its over now Let us all line in and make a
country on this continent that shall giv all Europe the cramp
in the stummuck evry time they look at us Adoo adoo

And as I am through I likewise say adoo to you jentle
reader merely remarkin that the StarSpangled Banner is
wavin round loose agin and that there dont seem to be
anything the matter with the Goddess of Liberty beyond a slite
cold

213 ARTEMUS WARD TO THE PRINCE OF WALES

think it has got biles friend Wales

In my country weve got war while your country in

American citizen of African scent scaped but so did
Vallandiggum who is Conservativ and who wus resuntly sent
South tho he would have bin sent to the Dry Tortoogus if Abe
had sposed for a minit that the Tortoogusses would keep him

We haint got any daily paper in our town but weve got a
female sewin circle which ansers the same purpuss and we
wasnt long in suspents as to who was drafted

One young man who was drawd claimed to be exemp because he was
the only son of a widowd mother who supported him A few
ablebodid dead men was drafted but whether their heirs will
have to pay 3 hundrid dollars a peace for em is a question
for Whitin who pears to be tinkerin up this draft bizniss
right smart I hope he makes good wages

I think most of the conscrips in this place will go A few
will go to Canady stopping on their way at Concord NH
where I understan there is a Muslum of Harts

You see Im sassy friend Wales hittin all sides but no
offense is ment You know I aint a politician and never

wellbalanced mind Says he Yes I have old hossfly he

Billson He is now an outcast in the State of Vermont The
miserble man once played Hamlet There wasnt any orchestry
and wishin to expire to slow moosic he died playin on a
claironett himself interspersed with hartrendin groans 
such is the world Alars alars how onthankful we air to
that Providence which kindly allows us to live and borrow
money and fail und do bizniss

But to return to our subjeck With our resunt grate triumps
on the Mississippi the Father of Waters and them is waters
no Father need feel shamed oftwig the wittikism and the
cheerin look of things in other places I reckon we shant
want any Muslum of Harts And what upon airth do the people
of Concord NH want a Muslum of Harts for Haint you got
the State House now  what more do you want

But all this is furrin to the purpuss of this note arter all
My objeck in now addressin you is to giv you sum advice
friend Wales about managin your wife a bizniss Ive had
over thirty years experience in

You had a good weddin The papers have a good deal to say
about vikins in connexion thare with Not knowings what
that air and so I frankly tells you my noble lord dook of
the throne I cant zackly say whether we hab em or not We
was both very much flustrated But I never injoyed myself
better in my life

Dowtless your supper was ahead of ourn As regards eatin
uses Baldinsville was allers shaky But you can git a good
meal in New York  cheap to You can git half a mackril at
Delmonicos or Mr Mason Dorys for six dollars and biled
pertaters throwd in

As I sed I manige my wife without any particler trouble
When I fust commenst trainin her I institooted a series of
experiments and them as didnt work I abandingd Youd
better do similer Your wife may objeck to gittin up and
bildin the fire in the mornin but if you commence with her
at once you may be able to overkum this prejoodiss I regret
to obsarve that I didnt commence arly enuff I wouldnt have
you spose I was ever kicked out of bed Not at all I
simply say in regard to bildin fires that I didnt
commence arly enuff It was a ruther cold mornin when I fust
proposed the idee to Betsy It wasnt well received and I
found myself layin on the floor putty suddent I thought Id
git up and bild the fire myself

Of course now youre marrid you can eat onions _I_ allus
did and if I know my own hart I allus will My daughter
who is goin on 17 and is frisky says theys disgustin And
speaking of my daughter reminds me that quite a number of
young men have suddenly discovered that Im a very
entertainin old feller and they visit us frekently
specially on Sunday evenins One young chapa lawyer by
habitdont cum as much as he did My wifes father lives
with us His intelleck totters a little and he saves the
papers containin the proceedins of our State Legislater The
old genlman likes to read out loud and he reads tolble
well He eats hash freely which makes his voice clear but
as he onfortnitly has to spell the most of his words I may
say he reads slow Wall whenever this lawyer made his
appearance I would set the old man areading the Legislativ
reports I kept the young lawyer up one night till 12 oclock
listenin to a lot of acts in regard to a drawbridge away orf
in the east part of the State havin sent my daughter to bed
at halfpast 8 He hasnt bin there since and I understan
he says I go round swindlin the Public

I never attempted to reorganize my wife but onct I shall
never attempt agin Id bin to a public dinner and had
allowed myself to be betrayed into drinkin several peoples
healths and wishin to make em as robust as possible I
continnerd drinkin their healths until my own became
affected Consekens was I presented myself at Betsys
bedside late at night with considble licker concealed about
my person I had sumhow got perseshun of a hosswhip on my way
home and rememberin sum cranky observations of Mrs Wards
in the mornin I snapt the whip putty lively and in a very
loud woice I sed Betsy you need reorganizin I have cum
Betsy I continuedcrackin the whip over the bedI have
cum to reorganize you Haave you perayed tonight

        

I dreamd that sumbody had laid a hosswhip over me sevril
conseckootiv times and when I woke up I found she had I
haint drank much of anythin since and if I ever have
another reorganizin job on hand I shall let it out

My wife is 52 years old and has allus sustained a good
character Shes a good cook Her mother lived to a
venerble age and died while in the act of frying slapjacks
for the County Commissioners And may no rood hand pluk a
flour from her toomstun We haint got any picter of the old
lady because shed never stand for her ambrotipe and
therefore I cant giv her likeness to the world through the
meejum of the illusterated papers but as she wasnt a
brigadierginral particlerly I dont spose theyd publish
it any how

Its best to give a woman considerable leeway But not too
much A naber of mine Mr Roofus Minkins was once very sick
with the fever but his wife moved his bed into the dooryard
while she was cleanin house I toald Roofus this wasnt the
thing specially as it was rainin vilently but he said he
wanted to giv his wife a little leeway That was 2 mutch
I told Mrs Minkins that her Roofus would die if he staid out
there into the rain much longer when she said It shant be
my fault if he dies unprepared at the same time tossin him
his mothers Bible It was orful I stood by however and
nussed him as wells I could but I was a putty wetnuss I
tell you

Theres varis ways of managin a wife friend Wales but the
best and only safe way is to let her do jist about as she
wants to I dopted that there plan sum time ago and it
works like a charm

Remember me kindly to Mrs Wales and good luck to you both
And as years roll by and accidents begin to happen to you
among which I hope therell be Twinsyou will agree with me
that family joys air the only ones a man can bet on with any
certinty of winnin

It may interest you to know that Im prosperin in a pecoonery
pint of view I make bout as much in the course of a year as
a cabnet offisser does  I understand my business a good
deal better than some of them do

 Respecks to St George  the Dragon
 Ever be appy
