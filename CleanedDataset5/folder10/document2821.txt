Preface

To THE ADDRESS OF

CAPTAIN J MAFFLIN

Duke of Derrys Pink Hussars

DEAR MAFFLINYou will remember that I wrote this story as an Awful
Warning None the less you have seen fit to disregard it and have
followed Gadsbys exampleas I betted you would I acknowledge that you
paid the money at once but you have prejudiced the mind of Mrs Mafflin
against myself for though I am almost the only respectable friend
of your bachelor days she has been darwaza band to me throughout the
season Further she caused you to invite me to dinner at the Club
where you called me a wild ass of the desert and went home
at halfpast ten after discoursing for twenty minutes on the
responsibilities of housekeeping You now drive a mailphaeton and sit
under a Church of England clergyman I am not angry Jack It is your
kismet as it was Gaddys and his kismet who can avoid Do not think
that I am moved by a spirit of revenge as I write thus publicly that
you and you alone are responsible for this book In other and more
expansive days when you could look at a magnum without flushing and
at a cheroot without turning white you supplied me with most of the
material Take it back againwould that I could have preserved your
fatherless speech in the tellingtake it back and by your slippered
hearth read it to the late Miss Deercourt She will not be any the more
willing to receive my cards but she will admire you immensely and you
I feel sure will love me You may even invite me to another very bad
dinnerat the Club which as you and your wife know is a safe
neutral ground for the entertainment of wild asses Then my very dear
hypocrite we shall be quits

Yours always

RUDYARD KIPLING

P SOn second thoughts I should recommend you to keep the book away
from Mrs Mafflin




POOR DEAR MAMMA

afternoon

anything dear

Miss THREEGAN Extracting long lavender silk stocking from the
rubbish You know him better than I do

horse entering Misses CAPTAIN GADSBY who is sitting in the shadow of
the windowcurtain and gazes round helplessly

action from the sire Aloud rising Good evening Miss Threegan

Miss T Conscious that she is flushing Good evening Captain Gadsby

Miss T Yes Im not a khansamah you know Perhaps you frighten him
You should never frighten a servant He loses his head Its very bad
policy

CAPT G Hes so awfly stupid

Miss T Folding her hands in her Zap You should call him quietly and
say O khansamah jee

CAPT G Getting interested Yes Aside Fancy that little
featherweight saying O khansamah jee to my bloodthirsty Mir Khan

Miss T Then you should explain the dinner dish by dish

CAPT G But I cant speak the vernacular

Miss T Patronizingly You should pass the Higher Standard and try

CAPT G I have but I dont seem to be any the wiser Are you

Miss T I never passed the Higher Standard But the khansamah is very
patient with me He doesnt get angry when I talk about sheeps topees
or order maunds of grain when I mean seers

grass in the bazar

CAPT G Admiringly How do you know

Nearly every day

CAPTAIN follows

CAPT G Aside Superb eyes I wonder that I never noticed them

Wednesday Can you spare me one

Miss T Shortly No I dont want any of your charitydances You only
ask me because Mamma told you to I hop and I bump You know I do

CAPT G Aside Thats true but little girls shouldnt understand
these things Aloud No on my word I dont You dance beautifully

thought officers in the Army didnt tell fibs

CAPT G It wasnt a fib believe me I really do want the pleasure of a
dance with you

Miss T Wickedly Why Wont Mamma dance with you any more

CAPT G More earnestly than the necessity demands I wasnt thinking
of your Mother Aside You little vixen

Miss T Still looking out of the window Eh Oh I beg your par don I
was thinking of something else

CAPT G Aside Well I wonder what shell say next Ive never known
a woman treat me like this before I might beDash it I might be an
Infantry subaltern Aloud Oh please dont trouble Im not worth
thinking about Isnt your Mother ready yet

Miss T I should think so but promise me Captain Gadsby you wont
take poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more It tires her so

CAPT G She says that no exercise tires her

Miss T Yes but she suffers afterward You dont know what rheumatism
is and you oughtnt to keep her out so late when it gets chill in the
evenings

CAPT G Aside Rheumatism I thought she came off her horse rather
in a bunch Whew One lives and learns Aloud Im sorry to hear that
She hasnt mentioned it to me

Miss T Flurried Of course not Poor dear Mamma never would And
you mustnt say that I told you either Promise me that you wont Oh
CAPTAIN Gadsby promise me you wont

CAPT G I am dumb orI shall be as soon as youve given me that
dance and anotherif you can trouble yourself to think about me for a
minute

Miss T But you wont like it one little bit Youll be awfully sorry

CAPT G I shall like it above all things and I shall only be sorry
that I didnt get more Aside Now what in the world am I saying

Miss T Very well You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are
trodden on Shall we say Seven

CAPT G And Eleven Aside She cant be more than eight stone but
even then its an absurdly small foot Looks at his own riding boots

Miss T Theyre beautifully shiny I can almost see my face in them

CAPT G I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the
rest of my life if you trod on my toes

Miss T Very likely Why not change Eleven for a square

CAPT G No please I want them both waltzes Wont you write them
down

Miss T J dont get so many dances that I shall confuse them You will
be the offender

CAPT G Wait and see Aside She doesnt dance perfectly perhaps
but

Miss T Your tea must have got cold by this time Wont you have another
cup

CAPT G No thanks Dont you think its pleasanter out in the veranda
Aside I never saw hair take that color in the sunshine before
Aloud Its like one of Dicksees pictures

Miss T Yes I Its a wonderful sunset isnt it Bluntly But what do
you know about Dicksees pictures

CAPT G I go Home occasionally And I used to know the Galleries
Nervously You mustnt think me only a Philistine witha moustache

Miss T Dont Please dont Im so sorry for what I said then I was
horribly rude It slipped out before I thought Dont you know the
temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake
of saying them Im afraid I gave way to it

CAPT G Watching the girl as she flushes I think I know the feeling
It would be terrible if we all yielded to it wouldnt it For instance
I might sayPOOR DEAR MAMMA Entering habited hatted and booted
Ah Captain Gadsby Sorry to keep you waiting Hope you havent been
bored My little girl been talking to you

Miss T Aside Im not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism Im not
Im NOT I only wished Id mentioned the corns too

CAPT G Aside What a shame I wonder how old she is It never
occurred to me before Aloud Weve been discussing Shakespeare and
the musical glasses in the veranda

Miss T Aside Nice man He knows that quotation He isnt a
Philistine with a moustache Aloud Goodbye Captain Gadsby Aside
What a huge hand and what a squeeze I dont suppose he meant it but he
has driven the rings into my fingers

POOR DEAR MAMMA Has Vermillion come round yet Oh yes Captain Gadsby
dont you think that the saddle is too far forward They pass into the
front veranda

CAPT G Aside How the dickens should I know what she prefers She
told me that she doted on horses Aloud I think it is

Miss T Coming out into front veranda Oh Bad Buldoo I must speak to
him for this He has taken up the curb two links and Vermillion bates
that Passes out and to horses head

CAPT G Let me do it

Miss T No Vermillion understands me Dont you old man Looses
curbchain skilfully and pats horse on nose and throttle Poor
Vermillion Did they want to cut his chin off There

Captain Gadsby watches the interlude with undisguised admiration

POOR DEAR MAMMA Tartly to Miss T Youve forgotten your guest I
think dear

Miss T Good gracious So I have Goodbye Retreats indoors hastily

POOR DEAR MAMMA Bunching reins in fingers hampered by too tight
gauntlets CAPTAIN Gadsby

CAPTAIN GADSBY stoops and makes the footrest POOR DEAR MAMMA blunders
halts too long and breaks through it

CAPT G Aside Cant hold up even stone forever Its all your
rheumatism Aloud Cant imagine why I was so clumsy Aside Now
Little Featherweight would have gone up like a bird

They ride oat of the garden The Captain falls back

CAPT G Aside How that habit catches her under the arms Ugh

POOR DEAR MAMMA With the worn smile of sixteen seasons the worse for
exchange Youre dull this afternoon CAPTAIN Gadsby

CAPT G Spurring up wearily Why did you keep me waiting so long

Et cetera et cetera et cetera

old man But Gandy was such a superior animal as a rule Why didnt he
go Home and pick his wife there

MACKESY They are all alike when they come to the turn into the
straight About thirty a man begins to get sick of living alone

CURTISS And of the eternal muttonychop in the morning

DOONE Its a dead goat as a rule but go on Mackesy

MACKESY If a mans once taken that way nothing will hold him Do you
remember Benoit of your service Doone They transferred him to Tharanda
when his time came and he married a platelayers daughter or something
of that kind She was the only female about the place

DONE Yes poor brute That smashed Benoits chances of promotion
altogether Mrs Benoit used to ask Was you gem to the dance this

tarbrush in the family I suppose

JERVOISE Tarbrush Not an anna You young fellows talk as though
the man was doing the girl an honor in marrying her Youre all too
conceitednothings good enough for you

BLAYNE Not even an empty Club a dam bad dinner at the Judges and
a Station as sickly as a hospital Youre quite right Were a set of
Sybarites

DOONE Luxurious dogs wallowing in

CURTISS Prickly heat between the shoulders Im covered with it Lets
hope Beora will be cooler

BLAYNE Whew Are you ordered into camp too I thought the Gunners had
a clean sheet

CURTISS No worse luck Two cases yesterdayone diedand if we have a
third out we go Is there any shooting at Beora Doone

DOONE The countrys under water except the patch by the Grand Trunk
Road I was there yesterday looking at a bund and came across four
poor devils in their last stage Its rather bad from here to Kuchara

CURTISS Then were pretty certain to have a heavy go of it Heigho
I shouldnt mind changing places with Gaddy for a while Sport with
Amaryllis in the shade of the Town Hall and all that Oh why doesnt
somebody come and marry me instead of letting me go into choleracamp

MACKESY Ask the Committee

CURTISS You ruffian Youll stand me another peg for that Blayne
what will you take Mackesy is fine on moral grounds Done have you any
preference

DONE Small glass Kummel please Excellent carminative these days
Anthony told me so

MACKESY Signing voucher for four drinks Most unfair punishment
I only thought of Curtiss as Actaeon being chivied round the billiard
tables by the nymphs of Diana

BLAYNE Curtiss would have to import his nymphs by train Mrs Cockleys
the only woman in the Station She wont leave Cockley and hes doing
his best to get her to go

CURTISS Good indeed Heres Mrs Cockleys health To the only wife in
the Station and a damned brave woman

OMNES Drinking A damned brave woman

BLAYNE I suppose Gandy will bring his wife here at the end of the cold
weather They are going to be married almost immediately I believe

CURTISS Gandy may thank his luck that the Pink Hussars are all
detachment and no headquarters this hot weather or hed be torn
from the arms of his love as sure as death Have you ever noticed the
thoroughminded way British Cavalry take to cholera Its because they
are so expensive If the Pinks had stood fast here they would have been
out in camp a month ago Yes I should decidedly like to be Gandy

MACKESY Hell go Home after hes married and send in his paperssee
if he doesnt

BLAYNE Why shouldnt he Hasnt he money Would any one of us be here
if we werent paupers

DONE Poor old pauper What has become of the six hundred you rooked
from our table last month

BLAYNE It took unto itself wings I think an enterprising tradesman got
some of it and a shroff gobbled the restor else I spent it

CURTISS Gandy never had dealings with a shroff in his life

DONE Virtuous Gandy If I had three thousand a month paid from
England I dont think Id deal with a shroff either

MACKESY Yawning Oh its a sweet life I wonder whether matrimony
would make it sweeter

CURTISS Ask Cockleywith his wife dying by inches

BLAYNE Go home and get a fool of a girl to come out towhat is it
Thackeray saysthe splendid palace of an Indian proconsul

DOONE Which reminds me My quarters leak like a sieve I had fever last
night from sleeping in a swamp And the worst of it is one cant do
anything to a roof till the Rains are over

CURTISS Whats wrong with you You havent eighty rotting Tommies to
take into a running stream

DONE No but Im mixed boils and bad language Im a regular Job all
over my body Its sheer poverty of blood and I dont see any chance of
getting richereither way

BLAYNE Cant you take leave DONE Thats the pull you Army men have
over us Ten days are nothing in your sight Im so important that
Government cant find a substitute if I go away Yees Id like to be
Gandy whoever his wife may be

CURTISS Youve passed the turn of life that Mackesy was speaking of

DONE Indeed I have but I never yet had the brutality to ask a woman to
share my life out here

BLAYNE On my soul I believe youre right Im thinking of Mrs Cockley
The womans an absolute wreck

DONE Exactly Because she stays down here The only way to keep her fit
would be to send her to the Hills for eight monthsand the same with
any woman I fancy I see myself taking a wife on those terms

MACKESY With the rupee at one and sixpence The little Doones would be
little Debra Doones with a fine Mussoorie chichi anent to bring home
for the holidays

CURTISS And a pair of beewtiful sambhurhorns for Done to wear free
of expense presented byDONE Yes its an enchanting prospect By the
way the rupee hasnt done falling yet The time will come when we shall
think ourselves lucky if we only lose half our pay

CURTISS Surely a thirds loss enough Who gains by the arrangement
Thats what I want to know

BLAYNE The Silver Question Im going to bed if you begin squabbling
Thank Goodness heres Anthonylooking like a ghost

Enter ANTHONY Indian Medical Staff very white and tired

ANTHONY Evening Blayne Its raining in sheets Whiskey peg lao
khitmatgar The roads are something ghastly

CURTISS Hows Mingle

ANTHONY Very bad and more frightened I handed him over to Fewton
Mingle might just as well have called him in the first place instead of
bothering me

BLAYNE Hes a nervous little chap What has he got this time

ANTHONY Cant quite say A very bad tummy and a blue funk so far He
asked me at once if it was cholera and I told him not to be a fool
That soothed him

CURTIS Poor devil The funk does half the business in a man of that
build

ANTHONY Lighting a cheroot I firmly believe the funk will kill him
if he stays down You know the amount of trouble hes been giving Fewton
for the last three weeks Hes doing his very best to frighten himself
into the grave

GENERAL CHORUS Poor little devil Why doesnt he get away

ANTHONY Cant He has his leave all right but hes so dipped he cant
take it and I dont think his name on paper would raise four annas
Thats in confidence though

MACKESY All the Station knows it

ANTHONY I suppose I shall have to die here he said squirming all
across the bed Hes quite made up his mind to Kingdom Come And I know
he has nothing more than a wetweather tummy if he could only keep a
hand on himself

BLAYNE Thats bad Thats very bad Poor little Miggy Good little
chap too I say

ANTHONY What do you say

BLAYNE Well look hereanyhow If its like thatas you sayI say
fifty

CURTISS I say fifty

MACKESY I go twenty better

DONE Bloated Croesus of the Bar I say fifty Jervoise what do you
say Hi Wake up

JERVOISE Eh Whats that Whats that

CURTISS We want a hundred rupees from you Youre a bachelor drawing a
gigantic income and theres a man in a hole

JERVOISE What man Any one dead

BLAYNE No but hell die if you dont give the hundred Here Heres a
pegvoucher You can see what weve signed for and Anthonys man will
come round tomorrow to collect it So there will be no trouble

JERVOISE Signing One hundred E M J There you are feebly It
isnt one of your jokes is it

BLAYNE No it really is wanted Anthony you were the biggest
pokerwinner last week and youve defrauded the taxcollector too long
Sign

ANTHONY Lets see Three fifties and a seventytwo twentythree
twentysay four hundred and twenty Thatll give him a month clear
at the Hills Many thanks you men Ill send round the chaprassi
tomorrow

CURTISS You must engineer his taking the stuff and of course you
mustnt

ANTHONY Of course It would never do Hed weep with gratitude over his
evening drink

BLAYNE Thats just what he would do damn him Oh I say Anthony you
pretend to know everything Have you heard about Gandy

ANTHONY No Divorce Court at last

BLAYNE Worse Hes engaged

ANTHONY How much He cant be

BLAYNE He is Hes going to be married in a few weeks Markyn told me
at the Judges this evening Its pukka

ANTHONY You dont say so Holy Moses Therell be a shine in the tents
of Kedar

CURTISS Regiment cut up rough think you

ANTHONY Dont know anything about the Regiment

MACKESY It is bigamy then

ANTHONY Maybe Do you mean to say that you men have forgotten or is
there more charity in the world than I thought

DONE You dont look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret You
bloat Explain

ANTHONY Mrs Herriott

BLAYNE After a long pause to the room generally Its my notion that
we are a set of fools

MACKESY Nonsense That business was knocked on the head last season
Why young Mallard

ANTHONY Mallard was a candlestick paraded as such Think awhile
Recollect last season and the talk then Mallard or no Mallard did
Gandy ever talk to any other woman

CURTISS Theres something in that It was slightly noticeable now you
come to mention it But shes at Naini Tat and hes at Simla

ANTHONY He had to go to Simla to look after a globetrotter relative of
hisa person with a title Uncle or aunt

BLAYNE And there he got engaged No law prevents a man growing tired of
a woman

ANTHONY Except that he mustnt do it till the woman is tired of him
And the Herriott woman was not that

CURTISS She may be now Two months of Naini Tal works wonders

DONE Curious thing how some women carry a Fate with them There was a
Mrs Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men invariably fell away and
got married It became a regular proverb with us when I was down there
I remember three men desperately devoted to her and they all one after
another took wives

CURTISS Thats odd Now I should have thought that Mrs Deegies
influence would have led them to take other mens wives It ought to
have made them afraid of the judgment of Providence

ANTHONY Mrs Herriott will make Gandy afraid of something more than the
judgment of Providence I fancy

BLAYNE Supposing things are as you say hell be a fool to face her
Hell sit tight at Simla

ANTHONY Shouldnt be a bit surprised if he went off to Naini to
explain Hes an unaccountable sort of man and shes likely to be a
more than unaccountable woman

DONE What makes you take her character away so confidently

ANTHONY Primum tern pus Caddy was her first and a woman doesnt allow
her first man to drop away without expostulation She justifies the
first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever
and ever Consequently

BLAYNE Consequently we are sitting here till past one oclock talking
scandal like a set of Station cats Anthony its all your fault
We were perfectly respectable till you came in Go to bed Im off
Goodnight all

CURTISS Past one Its past two by Jove and heres the khit coming for
the late charge Just Heavens One two three four five rupees to
pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is
no better than she should be Im ashamed of myself Go to bed you
slanderous villains and if Im sent to Beora tomorrow be prepared to
hear Im dead before paying my card account

continues his dinner

CAPT G In answer to the thunderstorm in her eyes Cornsmy worst

slowly his eyes on his plate Dyou remember that evening in July
before the Rains broke when you said that the end would have to come
sooner or laterand you wondered for which of US it would come first

breath in your body it should never come And I believed you

CAPT G Fingering menucard Well it has Thats all

contented yourself with merely Saying a thingyou swore that as far
as lay in your power youd make my wretched life pleasant for me And
youve denied me the consolation of breaking down I should have
done itindeed I should A woman would hardly have thought of this
refinement my kind considerate friend Fanguard as before You have
explained things so tenderly and truthfully too You havent spoken or
written a word of warning and you have let me believe in you till the
last minute You havent condescended to give me your reason yet No
A woman could not have managed it half so well Are there many men like
you in the world

CAPT G Im sure I dont know To Khitmatgar Ohe Simpkin do

of my compromising you Youve chosen your ground far too well and Ive
been properly brought up Lowering fan Havent you any pity Pip

for you

MRS H I think you have said it once or twice before Youre growing
very careful of my feelings My God Pip I was a good woman once You
said I was Youve made me what I am What are you going to do with

cant think worse than that

MRS H Oh yes I can And now will you tell me the reason of all
this Remorse Has Bayard been suddenly consciencestricken

CAPT G Angrily his eyes still lowered No The thing has come to an
end on my side Thats all Mafisch

wouldntI couldnt do itliar though you are

CAPT G Ive spoken the truth

MRS H My dear Sir you flatter yourself You have lied over the
reason Pip remember that I know you as you dont know yourself You
have been everything to me though you areFanguard Oh what a
contemptible Thing it is And so you are merely tired of me

CAPT G Since you insist upon my repeating itYes

MRS H Lie the first I wish I knew a coarser word Lie seems so
ineffectual in your case The fire has just died out and there is no
fresh one Think for a minute Pip if you care whether I despise you
more than I do Simply Mafisch is it

CAPT G Yes Aside I think I deserve this

MRS H Lie number two Before the next glass chokes you tell me her
name

CAPT G Aside Ill make her pay for dragging Minnie into the

MRS H Very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity
Youd cry my name on the housetops to make people turn round

CAPT G I wish I had There would have been an end to this business

MRS H Oh no there would notAnd so you were going to be virtuous
and blase were you To come to me and say Ive done with you The
incident is cloosed I ought to be proud of having kept such a man so
long

CAPT G Aside It only remains to pray for the end of the dinner
Aloud You know what I think of myself

I know your mind thoroughly I do You want to get it all over andOh
I cant keep you back And youre goingthink of it Pipto throw me
over for another woman And you swore that all other women werePip

one that I know

an earthquake

MRS H She cant Is there anything that I wouldnt do for youor

women are alike

CAPT G Aside Then this is the exception that proves the rule

any one else in the world and would sacrifice all the others to Oh do

believes that he is the only man I am interested in Ill tell you what
he said to me

MRS H Hes been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner
Shall I do it and you can see what an idiot he looks

CAPT G But what imports the nomination of this gentleman

MRS H Watch Sends a glance to the Vaynor man who tries vainly to
combine a mouthful of ice pudding a smirk of selfsatisfaction a glare
of intense devotion and the stolidity of a British dining countenance

CAPT G Critically He doesnt look pretty Why didnt you wait till
the spoon was out of his mouth

MRS H To amuse you Shell make an exhibition of you as Ive made of
him and people will laugh at you Oh Pip cant you see that Its

made a fool of like the others I never made a fool of you did I

CAPT G Aside What a clever little woman it is

MRS H Well what have you to say

pews

CAPT G Wagging his head with intense conviction Never mind There
is a pukka heaven

right But Darwin says that we came from those

books

MRS G Folding her hands If it pleases my Lord the King to issue
proclamation

you Are you nothing

the future then rememberI dont know quite how to put it

CAPT G Snorting indignantly Dont try Marry again indeed

MRS G I must Listen my husband Never never never tell your wife

MRS G And thats why you shouldnt have told me You must be the
Judge and oh Pip dearly as I love you I shant be able to help you
I shall hinder you and you must judge in spite of me

CAPT G Meditatively We have a great many things to find out
together God help us bothsay so Pussybut we shall understand each
other better every day and I think Im beginning to see now How in the
world did you come to know just the importance of giving me just that
lead

MRS G Ive told you that I dont know Only somehow it seemed that in
all this new life I was being guided for your sake as well as my own

CAPT G Aside Then Mafilin was right They know and wewere blind
all of us Lightly Getting a little beyond our depth dear arent
we Ill remember and if I fail let me be punished as I deserve

MRS G There shall be no punishment Well start into life together
from hereyou and Iand no one else

CAPT G And no one else A pause Your eyelashes are all wet Sweet
Was there ever such a quaint little Absurdity

MRS G Was there ever such nonsense talked before

CAPT G Knocking the ashes out of his pipe Tisnt what we say its
what we dont say that helps And its all the profoundest philosophy
But no one would understandeven if it were put into a book

MRS G The idea Noonly we ourselves or people like ourselvesif
there are any people like us

CAPT G Magisterially All people not like ourselves are blind
idiots

MRS G Wiping her eyes Do you think then that there are any people
as happy as we are

CAPT G Must beunless weve appropriated all the happiness in the
world

MRS G Looking toward Simla Poor dears Just fancy if we have

CAPT G Then well hang on to the whole show for its a great deal too
jolly to loseeh wife o mine

MRS G O Pip Pip How much of you is a solemn married man and how
much a horrid slangy schoolboy

CAPT G When you tell me how much of you was eighteen last birthday and
how much is as old as the Sphinx and twice as mysterious perhaps Ill
attend to you Lend me that banjo The spirit moveth me to jowl at the
sunset

MRS G Mind Its not tuned Ah How that jars

CAPT G Turning pegs Its amazingly different to keep a banjo to
proper pitch

MRS G Its the same with all musical instruments What shall it be

CAPT G Vanity and let the hills hear Sings through the first and
hal of the second verse Turning to MRS G Now chorus Sing Pussy

BOTH TOGETHER Con brio to the horror of the monkeys who are settling
for the night

 Vanity all is Vanity said Wisdom scorning me
 I clasped my true Loves tender hand and answered frank and freeee
 If this be Vanity whod be wise If this be Vanity whod be wise
 If this be Vanity whod be wiise Crescendo Vanity let it be

MRS G Defiantly to the grey of the evening sky Vanity let it be

ECHO Prom the Fagoo spur Let it be




FATIMA

And you may go in every room of the house and see everything that is
there but into the Blue Room you must not goThe Story of Blue Beard

SCENEThe GADSBYS bungalow in the Plains Time 11 A M on a
Sunday morning Captain GADSBY in his shirtsleeves is bending over a
complete set of Hussars equipment from saddle to picketingrope which
is neatly spread over the floor of his study He is smoking an unclean
briar and his forehead is puckered with thought

CAPT G To himself fingering a headstall Jacks an ass Theres
enough brass on this to load a muleand if the Americans know anything
about anything it can be cut down to a bit only Dont want the
wateringbridle either HumbugHalf a dozen sets of chains and pulleys
for one horse Rot Scratching his head Now lets consider it all
over from the beginning By Jove Ive forgotten the scale of weights
Neer mind Keep the bit only and eliminate every boss from the
crupper to breastplate No breastplate at all Simple leather strap
across the breastlike the Russians Hi Jack never thought of that

MRS G Entering hastily her hand bound in a cloth Oh Pip Ive
scalded my hand over that horrid horrid Tiparee jam

CAPT G Absently Eb Whaat

MRS G With roundeyed reproach Ive scalded it awfully Arent you
sorry And I did so want that jam to jam properly

CAPT G Poor little woman Let me kiss the place and make it well
Unrolling bandage You small sinner Wheres that scald I cant see
it

MRS G On the top of the little finger ThereIts a most normous big
burn

CAPT G Kissing little finger Baby Let Hyder look after the jam
You know I dont care for sweets

MRS G IndeedPip

CAPT G Not of that kind anyhow And now run along Minnie and leave
me to my own base devices Im busy

MRS G Calmly settling herself in long chair So I see What a mess
youre making Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into
the house

CAPT G To play with Do you mind dear

MRS G Let me play too Id like it

CAPT G Im afraid you wouldnt PussyDont you think that jam will
burn or whatever it is that jam does when its not looked after by a
clever little housekeeper

MRS G I thought you said Hyder could attend to it I left him in the
veranda stirringwhen I hurt myself so

CAPT G His eye returning to the equipment Pooor little
womanThree pounds four and seven is three eleven and that can be cut
down to two eight with just a leetle care without weakening anything
Farriery is all rot in incompetent hands Whats the use of a shoecase
when a mans scouting He cant stick it on with a licklike a
stampthe shoe Skittles

MRS G Whats skittles Pah What is this leather cleaned with

CAPT G Cream and champagne andLook here dear do you really want to
talk to me about anything important

MRS G No Ive done my accounts and I thought Id like to see what
youre doing

CAPT G Well love now youve seen andWould you mindThat is to
sayMinnie I really am busy

MRS G You want me to go

CAPT G Yes dear for a little while This tobacco will hang in your
dress and saddlery doesnt interest you

MRS G Everything you do interests me Pip

CAPT G Yes I know I know dear Ill tell you all about it some day
when Ive put a head on this thing In the meantime

MRS G Im to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child

CAPT G Noo I dont mean that exactly But you see I shall be
tramping up and down shifting these things to and fro and I shall be
in your way Dont you think so

MRS G Cant I lift them about Let me try Reaches forward to
troopers saddle

CAPT G Good gracious child dont touch it Youll hurt yourself
Picking up saddle Little girls arent expected to handle numdahs
Now where would you like it put Holds saddle above his head

MRS G A break in her voice Nowhere Pip how good you areand how
strong Oh whats that ugly red streak inside your arm

CAPT G Lowering saddle quickly Nothing Its a mark of sorts
Aside And Jacks coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried

MRS G I know its a mark but Ive never seen it before It runs all
up the arm What is it

CAPT G A cutif you want to know

MRS G Want to know Of course I do I cant have my husband cut to
pieces in this way How did it come Was it an accident Tell me Pip

CAPT G Grimly No Twasnt an accident I got itfrom a manin
Afghanistan

MRS G In action Oh Pip and you never told me

CAPT G Id forgotten all about it

MRS G Hold up your arm What a horrid ugly scar Are you sure it
doesnt hurt now How did the man give it you

CAPT G Desperately looking at his watch With a knife I came
downold Van Loo did thats to sayand fell on my leg so I couldnt
run And then this man came up and began chopping at me as I sprawled

MRS G Oh dont dont Thats enoughWell what happened

CAPT G I couldnt get to my holster and Mafflin came round the corner
and stopped the performance

MRS G How Hes such a lazy man I dont believe he did

CAPT G Dont you I dont think the man had much doubt about it Jack
cut his head off

MRS G Cuthisheadoff With one blow as they say in the books

CAPT G Im not sure I was too interested in myself to know much about
it Anyhow the head was off and Jack was punching old Van Loo in the
ribs to make him get up Now you know all about it dear and now

MRS G You want me to go of course You never told me about this
though Ive been married to you for ever so long and you never would
have told me if I hadnt found out and you never do tell me anything
about yourself or what you do or what you take an interest in

CAPT G Darling Im always with you arent I

MRS G Always in my pocket you were going to say I know you are but
you are always thinking away from me

CAPT G Trying to hide a smile Am I I wasnt aware of it Im
awfly sorry

MRS G Piteously Oh dont make fun of me Pip you know what I
mean When you are reading one of those things about Cavalry by that
idiotic Princewhy doesnt he be a Prince instead of a stableboy

CAPT G Prince Kraft a stableboyOh my Aunt Never mind dear You
were going to say

MRS G It doesnt matter you dont care for what I say Onlyonly
you get up and walk about the room staring in front of you and then
Mafflin comes in to dinner and after Im in the drawingroom I can hear
you and him talking and talking and talking about things I cant
understand andoh I get so tired and feel so lonelyI dont want to
complain and be a trouble Pip but I do indeed I do

CAPT G My poor darling I never thought of that Why dont you ask
some nice people in to dinner

MRS G Nice people Where am I to find them Horrid frumps And if I
did I shouldnt be amused You know I only want you

CAPT G And you have me surely Sweetheart

MRS G I have not Pip why dont you take me into your life

CAPT G More than I do That would be difficult dear

MRS G Yes I suppose it wouldto you Im no help to youno
companion to you and you like to have it so

CAPT G Arent you a little unreasonable Pussy

MRS G Stamping her foot Im the most reasonable woman in the
worldwhen Im treated properly

CAPT G And since when have I been treating you improperly

MRS G Alwaysand since the beginning You know you have

CAPT G I dont but Im willing to be convinced

MRS G Pointing to saddlery There

CAPT G How do you mean

MRS G What does all that mean Why am I not to be told Is it so
precious

CAPT G I forget its exact Government value just at present It means
that it is a great deal too heavy

MRS G Then why do you touch it

CAPT G To make it lighter See here little love Ive one notion
and Jack has another but we are both agreed that all this equipment is
about thirty pounds too heavy The thing is how to cut it down without
weakening any part of it and at the same time allowing the trooper
to carry everything he wants for his own comfortsocks and shirts and
things of that kind

MRS G Why doesnt he pack them in a little trunk

CAPT G Kissing her Oh you darling Pack them in a little trunk
indeed Hussars dont carry trunks and its a most important thing to
make the horse do all the carrying

MRS G But why need you bother about it Youre not a trooper

CAPT G No but I command a few score of him and equipment is nearly
everything in these days

MRS G More than me

CAPT G Stupid Of course not but its a matter that Im tremendously
interested in because if I or Jack or I and Jack work out some sort
of lighter saddlery and all that its possible that we may get it
adopted

MRS G How

CAPT G Sanctioned at Home where they will make a sealed patterna
pattern that all the saddlers must copyand so it will be used by all
the regiments

MRS G And that interests you

CAPT G Its part of my profession yknow and my profession is a good
deal to me Everything in a soldiers equipment is important and if we
can improve that equipment so much the better for the soldiers and for
us

MRS G Whos us

CAPT G Jack and I only Jacks notions are too radical Whats that
big sigh for Minnie

MRS G Oh nothingand youve kept all this a secret from me Why

CAPT G Not a secret exactly dear I didnt say anything about it to
you because I didnt think it would amuse you

MRS G And am I only made to be amused

CAPT G No of course I merely mean that it couldnt interest you

MRS G Its your work andand if youd let me Id count all these
things up If they are too heavy you know by how much they are too
heavy and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of
lightness and

CAPT G I have got both scales somewhere in my head but its hard to
tell how light you can make a headstall for instance until youve
actually had a model made

MRS G But if you read out the list I could copy it down and pin it
up there just above your table Wouldnt that do

CAPT G It would be awfly nice dear but it would be giving you
trouble for nothing I cant work that way I go by rule of thumb I
know the present scale of weights and the other onethe one that
Im trying to work towill shift and vary so much that I couldnt be
certain even if I wrote it down

MRS G Im so sorry I thought I might help Is there anything else
that I could be of use in

CAPT G Looking round the room I cant think of anything Youre
always helping me you know

MRS G Am I How

CAPT G You are of course and as long as youre near meI cant
explain exactly but its in the air

MRS G And thats why you wanted to send me away

CAPT G Thats only when Im trying to do workgrubby work like this

MRS G Mafflins better then isnt he

CAPT G Rashly Of course he is Jack and I have been thinking along
the same groove for two or three years about this equipment Its our
hobby and it may really be useful some day

MRS G After a pause And thats all that you have away from me

CAPT G It isnt very far away from you now Take care the oil on that
bit doesnt come off on your dress

MRS G I wishI wish so much that I could really help you I believe I
couldif I left the room But thats not what I mean

CAPT G Aside Give me patience I wish she would go Aloud I
assure you you cant do anything for me Minnie and I must really
settle down to this Wheres my pouch

MRS G Crossing to writingtable Here you are Bear What a mess you
keep your table in

CAPT G Dont touch it Theres a method in my madness though you
mightnt think of it

MRS G At table I want to lookDo you keep accounts Pip

CAPT G Bending over saddlery Of a sort Are you rummaging among the
Troop papers Be careful

MRs G Why I shant disturb anything Good gracious I had no idea
that you had anything to do with so many sick horses

CAPT G Wish I hadnt but they insist on falling sick Minnie if
I were you I really should not investigate those papers You may come
across something that you wont like

MRS G Why will you always treat me like a child I know Im not
displacing the horrid things

CAPT G Resignedly Very well then Dont blame me if anything
happens Play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery
Slipping hand into trouserspocket Oh the deuce

MRS G Her back to G Whats that for

CAPT G Nothing Aside Theres not much in it but I wish Id torn
it up

MRS G Turning over contents of table I know youll hate me for
this but I do want to see what your work is like A pause Pip what
are farcybuds

CAPT G Hab Would you really like to know They arent pretty things

MRS G This Journal of Veterinary Science says they are of absorbing
interest Tell me

CAPT G Aside It may turn her attention

Gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy

MRS G Oh thats enough Dont go on

CAPT G But you wanted to knowThen these things suppurate and
matterate and spread

MRS G Pin youre making me sick Youre a horrid disgusting
schoolboy

CAPT G On his knees among the bridles You asked to be told Its
not my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors

MRS G Why didnt you sayNo

CAPT G Good Heavens child Have you come in here simply to bully me

MRS G I bully you How could I Youre so strong Hysterically
Strong enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me
there to cry Arent you

CAPT G It seems to me that youre an irrational little baby Are you
quite well

MRS G Do I look ill Returning to table Who is your lady friend
with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside

CAPT G Aside Then it wasnt locked up confound it Aloud
God made her therefore let her pass for a woman You remember what
farcybuds are like

MRS G Showing envelope This has nothing to do with them Im going
to open it May I

CAPT G Certainly if you want to Id sooner you didnt though I
dont ask to look at your letters to the Deercourt girl

MRS G Youd better not Sir Takes letter from envelope Now may I
look If you say no I shall cry

CAPT G Youve never cried in my knowledge of you and I dont believe
you could

MRS G I feel very like it today Pip Dont be hard on me Reads
letter It begins in the middle without any Dear Captain Gadsby or
anything How funny

CAPT G Aside No its not Dear Captain Gadsby or anything now
How funny

MRS G What a strange letter Reads And so the moth has come
too near the candle at last and has been singed intoshall I say
Respectability I congratulate him and hope he will be as happy as he
deserves to be What does that mean Is she congratulating you about
our marriage

CAPT G Yes I suppose so

MRS G Still reading letter She seems to be a particular friend of
yours

CAPT G Yes She was an excellent matron of sortsa Mrs
Herriottwife of a Colonel Herriott I used to know some of her people
at Home long agobefore I came out

MRS G Some Colonels wives are youngas young as me I knew one who
was younger

CAPT G Then it couldnt have been Mrs Herriott She was old enough to
have been your mother dear

MRS G I remember now Mrs Scargill was talking about her at the
Dutfins tennis before you came for me on Tuesday Captain Mafflin
said she was a dear old woman Do you know I think Mafilin is a very
clumsy man with his feet

CAPT G Aside Good old Jack Aloud Why dear

MRS G He had put his cup down on the ground then and he literally
stepped into it Some of the tea spirted over my dressthe grey one I
meant to tell you about it before

CAPT G Aside There are the makings of a strategist about Jack
though his methods are coarse Aloud Youd better get a new dress
then Aside Let us pray that that will turn her

MRS G Oh it isnt stained in the least I only thought that Id tell
you Returning to letter What an extraordinary person Reads
But need I remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of
wardshipwhat in the world is a charge of wardshipwhich as you
yourself know may end in Consequences

CAPT G Aside Its safest to let em see everything as they come
across it but seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule
Aloud I told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging
my table

MRS G Absently What does the woman mean She goes on talking about
Consequencesalmost inevitable Consequences with a capital C for
half a page Flushing scarlet Oh good gracious How abominable

CAPT G Promptly Do you think so Doesnt it show a sort of motherly
interest in us Aside Thank Heaven Harry always wrapped her meaning
up safely Aloud Is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter
darling

MRS G Its impertinentits simply horrid What right has this woman
to write in this way to you She oughtnt to

CAPT G When you write to the Deercourt girl I notice that you
generally fill three or four sheets Cant you let an old woman babble
on paper once in a way She means well

MRS G I dont care She shouldnt write and if she did you ought to
have shown me her letter

CAPT G Cant you understand why I kept it to myself or must I explain
at lengthas I explained the farcybuds

MRS G Furiously Pip I hate you This is as bad as those idiotic
saddlebags on the floor Never mind whether it would please me or not
you ought to have given it to me to read

CAPT G It comes to the same thing You took it yourself

MRS G Yes but if I hadnt taken it you wouldnt have said a word
I think this Harriet Herriottits like a name in a bookis an
interfering old Thing

CAPT G Aside So long as you thoroughly understand that she is old
I dont much care what you think Aloud Very good dear Would you
like to write and tell her so Shes seven thousand miles away

MRS G I dont want to have anything to do with her but you ought to
have told me Turning to last page of letter And she patronizes me
too Ive never seen her Reads I do not know how the world stands
with you in all human probability I shall never know but whatever I
may have said before I pray for her sake more than for yours that all
may be well I have learned what misery means and I dare not wish that
any one dear to you should share my knowledge

CAPT G Good God Cant you leave that letter alone or at least
cant you refrain from reading it aloud Ive been through it once Put
it back on he desk Do you hear me

MRS G Irresolutely I shshant Looks at Gs eyes Oh Pip

I oughtnt to have been here at all andandandsobbing Oh be
good to me Be good to me Theres only youanywhere Breaks down in
long chair hiding face in cushions

CAPT G Aside She doesnt know how she flicked me on the raw
Aloud bending over chair I didnt mean to be harsh dearI didnt

Bends lower MRS G slides right arm round his neck Several interludes
and much sobbing

Pettishly I knew I couldnt take the last note How do the bass

THE SWELLING OF JORDAN

If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how
canst thou contend with horses And if in the land of peace wherein thou
trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of
Jordan

SCENEThe GADSBYS bungalow in the Plains on a January morning MRS
G arguing with bearer in back veranda

CAPT M Mornin Mrs Gadsby Hows the Infant Phenomenon and the
Proud Proprietor

Passes into front veranda where GADSBY is watching GADSBY JUNIOR aged
ten months crawling about the matting

CAPT M Whats the trouble Gaddyspoiling an honest mans Europe

amazingly Any amount of bone below the knee there

CAPT G Yes hes a healthy little scoundrel Dont you think his
hairs growing

CAPT M Lets have a look Hi Hst Come here General Luck and well

MRS G Within What absurd name will you give him next Why do you
call him that

CAPT M Isnt he our InspectorGeneral of Cavalry Doesnt he come
down in his seventeentwo perambulator every morning the Pink Hussars
parade Dont wriggle Brigadier Give us your private opinion on the
way the third squadron went past Trifle ragged werent they

CAPT G A bigger set of tailors than the new draft I dont wish to see
Theyve given me more than my fair shareknocking the squadron out of
shape Its sickening

CAPT M When youre in command youll do better young un Cant you
walk yet Grip my finger and try To G Twont hurt his hocks will
it

CAPT G Oh no Dont let him flop though or hell lick all the
blacking off your boots

MRS G Within Whos destroying my sons character

CAPT M And my Godsons Im ashamed of you Gaddy Punch your father
in the eye Jack Dont you stand it Hit him again

CAPT G Sotto voce Put The Butcha down and come to the end of the
veranda Id rather the Wife didnt hearjust now

CAPT M You look awfly serious Anything wrong

CAPT G Depends on your view entirely I say Jack you wont think
more hardly of me than you can help will you Come further this
wayThe fact of the matter is that Ive made up my mindat least Im
thinking seriously ofcutting the Service

CAPT M Hwhatt

CAPT G Dont shout Im going to send in my papers

CAPT M You Are you mad

CAPT G Noonly married

CAPT M Look here Whats the meaning of it all You never intend to
leave us You cant Isnt the best squadron of the best regiment of the
best cavalry in all the world good enough for you

CAPT G Jerking his head over his shoulder She doesnt seem to
thrive in this Godforsaken country and theres The Butcha to be
considered and all that you know

CAPT M Does she say that she doesnt like India

CAPT G Thats the worst of it She wont for fear of leaving me

CAPT M What are the Hills made for

CAPT G Not for my wife at any rate

CAPT M You know too much Gaddy andI dont like you any the better
for it

CAPT G Never mind that She wants England and The Butcha would be all
the better for it Im going to chuck You dont understand

CAPT M Hotly I understand this One hundred and thirtyseven new
horse to be licked into shape somehow before Luck comes round again a
hairyheeled draft wholl give more trouble than the horses a camp next
cold weather for a certainty ourselves the first on the roster the
Russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes notice and you
the best of us all backing out of it all Think a little Gaddy You
wont do it

CAPT G Hang it a man has some duties toward his family I suppose

CAPT M I remember a man though who told me the night after
Amdheran when we were picketed under Jagai and hed left his swordby
the way did you ever pay Ranken for that swordin an Utmanzais
headthat man told me that hed stick by me and the Pinks as long as
he lived I dont blame him for not sticking by meIm not much of a
manbut I do blame him for not sticking by the Pink Hussars

CAPT G Uneasily We were little more than boys then Cant you see
Jack how things stand Tisnt as if we were serving for our bread
Weve all of us more or less got the filthy lucre Im luckier than
some perhaps Theres no call for me to serve on

CAPT M None in the world for you or for us except the Regimental If
you dont choose to answer to that of course

CAPT G Dont be too hard on a man You know that a lot of us only take
up the thing for a few years and then go back to Town and catch on with
the rest

CAPT M Not lots and they arent some of Us

CAPT G And then there are ones affairs at Home to be consideredmy
place and the rents and all that I dont suppose my father can last
much longer and that means the title and so on

CAPT M Fraid you wont be entered in the Stud Book correctly unless
you go Home Take six months then and come out in October If I could
slay off a brother or two I spose I should be a Marquis of sorts
Any fool can be that but it needs men Gaddymen like youto lead
flanking squadrons properly Dont you delude yourself into the belief
that youre going Home to take your place and prance about among
pinknosed Kabuli dowagers You arent built that way I know better

CAPT G A man has a right to live his life as happily as he can You
arent married

CAPT M Nopraise be to Providence and the one or two women who have
had the good sense to jawab me

CAPT G Then you dont know what it is to go into your own room and see
your wifes head on the pillow and when everything else is safe and the
house shut up for the night to wonder whether the roofbeams wont give
and kill her

CAPT M Aside Revelations first and second Aloud Soo I knew
a man who got squiffy at our Mess once and confided to me that he never
helped his wife on to her horse without praying that shed break her neck
before she came back All husbands arent alike you see

CAPT G What on earth has that to do with my case The man must ha
been mad or his wife as bad as they make em

CAPT M Aside No fault of yours if either werent all you say
Youve forgotten the time when you were insane about the Herriott woman
You always were a good hand at forgetting Aloud Not more mad than
men who go to the other extreme Be reasonable Gaddy Your roofbeams
are sound enough

CAPT G That was only a way of speaking Ive been uneasy and worried
about the Wife ever since that awful business three years agowhenI
nearly lost her Can you wonder

CAPT M Oh a shell never falls twice in the same place Youve paid
your toll to misfortunewhy should your Wife be picked out more than
anybody elses

CAPT G I can talk just as reasonably as you can but you dont
understandyou dont understand And then theres The Butcha Deuce
knows where the Ayah takes him to sit in the evening He has a bit of a
cough Havent you noticed it

CAPT M Bosh The Brigadiers jumping out of his skin with pure
condition Hes got a muzzle like a roseleaf and the chest of a
twoyearold Whats demoralized you

CAPT G Funk Thats the long and the short of it Funk

CAPT M But what is there to funk

CAPT G Everything Its ghastly

CAPT M Ah I see

You dont want to fight And by Jingo when we do Youve got the kid
youve got the Wife Youve got the money too

Thats about the case eh

CAPT G I suppose thats it But its not br myself Its because of
them At least I think it is

CAPT M Are you sure Looking at the matter in a coldblooded light
the Wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight She has
an ancestral home to go to money and the Brigadier to carry on the
illustrious name

CAPT G Then it is for myself or because they are part of me You dont
see it My lifes so good so pleasant as it is that I want to make it
quite safe Cant you understand

CAPT M Perfectly Shelterpit for the Offcers charger as they say
in the Line

CAPT G And I have everything to my hand to make it so Im sick of the
strain and the worry for their sakes out here and there isnt a single
real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether Itll only cost
meJack I hope youll never know the shame that Ive been going
through for the past six months

CAPT M Hold on there I dont wish to be told Every man has his moods
and tenses sometimes

CAPT G Laughing bitterly Has he What do you call craning over to
see where your nearfore lands

CAPT M In my case it means that I have been on the Considerable Bend
and have come to parade with a Head and a Hand It passes in three
strides

CAPT G Lowering voice It never passes with me Jack Im always
thinking about it Phil Gadsby funking a fall on parade Sweet picture
isnt it Draw it for me

CAPT M Gravely Heaven forbid A man like you cant be as bad as
that A fall is no nice thing but one never gives it a thought

CAPT G Doesnt one Wait till youve got a wife and a youngster of
your own and then youll know how the roar of the squadron behind you
turns you cold all up the back

CAPT M Aside And this man led at Amdheran after Bagal Deasin went
under and we were all mixed up together and he came out of the snow
dripping like a butcher Aloud Skittles The men can always open out
and you can always pick your way more or less We havent the dust to
bother us as the men have and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a
man

CAPT G Neveras long as he can see But did they open out for poor
Errington

CAPT M Oh this is childish

CAPT G I know it is worse than that I dont care Youve ridden
Van Loo Is he the sort of brute to pick his wayspecially when were
coming up in column of troop with any pace on

CAPT M Once in a Blue Moon do we gallop in column of troop and then
only to save time Arent three lengths enough for you

CAPT G Yesquite enough They just allow for the full development of
the smash Im talking like a cur I know but I tell you that for the
past three months Ive felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of
my back every time that Ive led

CAPT M But Gaddy this is awful

CAPT G Isnt it lovely Isnt it royal A Captain of the Pink Hussars
watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing Colonel
of a Black Regiment

CAPT M You never did

CAPT G Once Only He squelched like a mussuck and the
TroopSergeantMajor cocked his eye at me You know old Haffys eye I
was afraid to do it again

CAPT M I should think so That was the best way to rupture old Van
Loos tummy and make him crumple you up You knew that

CAPT G I didnt care It took the edge off him

CAPT M Took the edge off him Gaddy youyouyou mustnt you
know Think of the men

CAPT G Thats another thing I am afraid of Dyou spose they know

CAPT M Lets hope not but theyre deadly quick to spot skirmlittle
things of that kind See here old man send the Wife Home for the hot
weather and come to Kashmir with me Well start a boat on the Dal or
cross the Rhotangshoot ibex or loafwhich you please Only come
Youre a bit off your oats and youre talking nonsense Look at the
Colonelswagbellied rascal that he is He has a wife and no end of a
bowwindow of his own Can any one of us ride round himchalkstones and
all I cant and I think I can shove a crock along a bit

CAPT G Some men are different I havent any nerve Lord help me I
havent the nerve Ive taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well
under the wallets I cant help it Im so afraid of anything happening
to me On my soul I ought to be broke in front of the squadron for
cowardice

CAPT M Ugly word that I should never have the courage to own up

CAPT G I meant to lie about my reasons when I began butIve got out
of the habit of lying to you old man Jack you wontBut I know you
wont

CAPT M Of course not Half aloud The Pinks are paying dearly for
their Pride

CAPT G Eb Whatat

CAPT M Dont you know The men have called Mrs Gadsby the Pride of
the Pink Hussars ever since she came to us

CAPT G Tisnt her fault Dont think that Its all mine

CAPT M What does she say

CAPT G I havent exactly put it before her Shes the best little
woman in the world Jack and all thatbut she wouldnt counsel a man
to stick to his calling if it came between him and her At least I
think

CAPT M Never mind Dont tell her what you told me Go on the Peerage
and LandedGentry tack

CAPT G Shed see through it Shes five times cleverer than I am

CAPT M Aside Then shell accept the sacrifice and think a little
bit worse of him for the rest of her days

CAPT G Absently I say do you despise me

CAPT M Queer way of putting it Have you ever been asked that
question Think a minute What answer used you to give

CAPT G So bad as that Im not entitled to expect anything more but
its a bit hard when ones best friend turns round and

CAPT M So have found But you will have consolationsBailiffs and
Drains and Liquid Manure and the Primrose League and perhaps if
youre lucky the Colonelcy of a Yeomanry Cavalry Regimentall
uniform and no riding I believe How old are you

CAPT G Thirtythree I know its

CAPT M At forty youll be a fool of a J P landlord At fifty youll
own a bathchair and The Brigadier if he takes after you will be
fluttering the dovecotes ofwhats the particular dunghill youre going
to Also Mrs Gadsby will be fat

CAPT G Limply This is rather more than a joke

CAPT M Dyou think so Isnt cutting the Service a joke It generally
takes a man fifty years to arrive at it Youre quite right though It
is more than a joke Youve managed it in thirtythree

CAPT G Dont make me feel worse than I do Will it satisfy you if I
own that I am a shirker a skrimshanker and a coward

CAPT M It wil not because Im the only man in the world who can talk
to you like this without being knocked down You mustnt take all that
Ive said to heart in this way I only spokea lot of it at leastout
of pure selfishness because becauseOh damn it all old manI dont
know what I shall do without you Of course youve got the money and
the place and all thatand there are two very good reasons why you
should take care of yourself

CAPT G Doesnt make it any sweeter Im backing outI know I am I
always had a soft drop in me somewhereand I darent risk any danger to
them

CAPT M Why in the world should you Youre bound to think of your
familybound to think Erhmm If I wasnt a younger son Id go toobe
shot if I wouldnt

CAPT G Thank you Jack Its a kind lie but its the blackest youve
told for some time I know what Im doing and Im going into it with my
eyes open Old man I cant help it What would you do if you were in my
place

CAPT M Aside Couldnt conceive any woman getting permanently
between me and the Regiment Aloud Cant say Very likely I should
do no better Im sorry for youawfly sorrybut if thems your
sentiments I believe I really do that you are acting wisely

CAPT G Do you I hope you do In a whisper Jack be very sure of
yourself before you marry Im an ungrateful ruffian to say this but
marriageeven as good a marriage as mine has beenhampers a mans
work it cripples his swordarm and oh it plays Hell with his notions
of duty Sometimesgood and sweet as she issometimes I could wish
that I had kept my freedomNo I dont mean that exactly

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
