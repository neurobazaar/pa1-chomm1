FOMA GORDYEFF

The Man Who Was Afraid

By Maxim Gorky


Translated by Herman Bernstein




INTRODUCTORY NOTE

OUT of the darkest depths of life where vice and crime and misery
abound comes the Byron of the twentieth century the poet of the
vagabond and the proletariat Maxim Gorky Not like the beggar humbly
imploring for a crust in the name of the Lord nor like the jeweller
displaying his precious stones to dazzle and tempt the eye he comes to
the worldnay in accents of Tyrtaeus this commoner of Nizhni Novgorod
spurs on his troops of freedomloving heroes to conquer as it were
the placid selfsatisfied literatures of today and bring new life to
pale bloodless frames

Like Byrons impassioned utterances borne on the tones of a wild and
quite artless melody is Gorkys mad unbridled powerful voice as he
sings of the madness of the brave of the barefooted dreamers who are
proud of their idleness who possess nothing and fear nothing who are
gay in their misery though miserable in their joy

Gorkys voice is not the calm cultivated wellbalanced voice
of Chekhov the Russian De Maupassant nor even the apostolic
wellmeaning but comparatively faint voice of Tolstoy the preacher it
is the roaring of a lion the crash of thunder In its elementary power
is the heart rending cry of a sincere but suffering soul that saw the
brutality of life in all its horrors and now flings its experiences
into the face of the world with unequalled sympathy and the courage of a
giant

For Gorky above all has courage he dares to say that he finds the
vagabond the outcast of society more sublime and significant than
society itself

His Bosyak the symbolic incarnation of the Overman is as naive and
as bold as a childor as a genius In the vehement passions of the
magnanimous compassionate hero in tatters in the aristocracy of his
soul and in his constant thirst for Freedom Gorky sees the rebellious
and irreconcilable spirit of man of future manin these he sees
something beautiful something powerful something monumental and is
carried away by their strange psychology For the barefooted dreamers
life is Gorkys life his ideals are Gorkys ideals his pleasures and
pains Gorkys pleasures and pains

And Gorky though broken in health now buffeted by the storms of fate
bruised and wounded in the battlefield of life still like Byron and
like Lermontov

 seeks the storm
 As though the storm contained repose

And in a leonine voice he cries defiantly

 Let the storm rage with greater force and fury

CHAPTER I

ABOUT sixty years ago when fortunes of millions had been made on the
Volga with fairytale rapidity Ignat Gordyeeff a young fellow was
working as waterpumper on one of the barges of the wealthy merchant
Zayev

Built like a giant handsome and not at all stupid he was one of those
people whom luck always follows everywherenot because they are gifted
and industrious but rather because having an enormous stock of energy
at their command they cannot stop to think over the choice of means
when on their way toward their aims and excepting their own will
they know no law Sometimes they speak of their conscience with fear
sometimes they really torture themselves struggling with it but
conscience is an unconquerable power to the fainthearted only the
strong master it quickly and make it a slave to their desires for
they unconsciously feel that given room and freedom conscience would
fracture life They sacrifice days to it and if it should happen
that conscience conquered their souls they are never wrecked even in
defeatthey are just as healthy and strong under its sway as when they
lived without conscience

At the age of forty Ignat Gordyeeff was himself the owner of three
steamers and ten barges On the Volga he was respected as a rich and
clever man but was nicknamed Frantic because his life did not flow
along a straight channel like that of other people of his kind but
now and again boiling up turbulently ran out of its rut away from
gainthe prime aim of his existence It looked as though there were
three Gordyeeffs in him or as though there were three souls in Ignats
body One of them the mightiest was only greedy and when Ignat lived
according to its commands he was merely a man seized with untamable
passion for work This passion burned in him by day and by night he
was completely absorbed by it and grabbing everywhere hundreds and
thousands of roubles it seemed as if he could never have enough of
the jingle and sound of money He worked about up and down the Volga
building and fastening nets in which he caught gold he bought up grain
in the villages floated it to Rybinsk on his barges he plundered
cheated sometimes not noticing it sometimes noticing and triumphant
be openly laughed at by his victims and in the senselessness of his
thirst for money he rose to the heights of poetry But giving up so
much strength to this hunt after the rouble he was not greedy in
the narrow sense and sometimes he even betrayed an inconceivable but
sincere indifference to his property Once when the ice was drifting
down the Volga he stood on the shore and seeing that the ice was
breaking his new barge having crushed it against the bluff shore he
ejaculated

Thats it Again Crush it Now once more Try

Well Ignat asked his friend Mayakin coming up to him the ice is
crushing about ten thousand out of your purse eh

Thats nothing Ill make another hundred But look how the Volga is
working Eh Fine She can split the whole world like curd with a
knife Look look There you have my Boyarinya She floated but once
Well well have mass said for the dead

The barge was crushed into splinters Ignat and the godfather sitting
in the tavern on the shore drank vodka and looked out of the window
watching the fragments of the Boyarinya drifting down the river
together with the ice

Are you sorry for the vessel Ignat asked Mayakin

Why should I be sorry for it The Volga gave it to me and the Volga
has taken it back It did not tear off my hand

Nevertheless

Whatnevertheless It is good at least that I saw how it was all done
Its a lesson for the future But when my Volgar was burnedI was
really sorryI didnt see it How beautiful it must have looked when
such a woodpile was blazing on the water in the dark night Eh It was
an enormous steamer

Werent you sorry for that either

For the steamer It is true I did feel sorry for the steamer But
then it is mere foolishness to feel sorry Whats the use I might have
cried tears cannot extinguish fire Let the steamers burn And even
though everything be burned down Id spit upon it If the soul is but
burning to work everything will be erected anew Isnt it so

Yes said Mayakin smiling These are strong words you say And
whoever speaks that way even though he loses all will nevertheless be
rich

Regarding losses of thousands of roubles so philosophically Ignat knew
the value of every kopeika he gave to the poor very seldom and only to
those that were altogether unable to work When a more or less healthy
man asked him for alms Ignat would say sternly

Get away You can work yet Go to my dvornik and help him to remove the
dung Ill pay you for it

Whenever he had been carried away by his work he regarded people
morosely and piteously nor did he give himself rest while hunting for
roubles And suddenlyit usually happened in spring when everything on
earth became so bewitchingly beautiful and something reproachfully wild
was breathed down into the soul from the clear skyIgnat Gordyeeff
would feel that he was not the master of his business but its low
slave He would lose himself in thought and inquisitively looking about
himself from under his thick knitted eyebrows walk about for days
angry and morose as though silently asking something which he feared
to ask aloud They awakened his other soul the turbulent and lustful
soul of a hungry beast Insolent and cynical he drank led a depraved
life and made drunkards of other people He went into ecstasy and
something like a volcano of filth boiled within him It looked as though
he was madly tearing the chains which he himself had forged and carried
and was not strong enough to tear them Excited and very dirty his face
swollen from drunkenness and sleeplessness his eyes wandering madly
and roaring in a hoarse voice he tramped about the town from one tavern
to another threw away money without counting it cried and danced
to the sad tunes of the folk songs or fought but found no rest
anywherein anything

It happened one day that a degraded priest a short stout little
baldheaded man in a torn cassock chanced on Ignat and stuck to him
just as a piece of mud will stick to a shoe An impersonal deformed and
nasty creature he played the part of a buffoon they smeared his
bald head with mustard made him go upon allfours drink mixtures of
different brandies and dance comical dances he did all this in silence
an idiotic smile on his wrinkled face and having done what he was told
to do he invariably said outstretching his hand with his palm upward

Give me a rouble

They laughed at him and sometimes gave him twenty kopeiks sometimes
gave him nothing but it sometimes happened that they threw him a
tenrouble bill and even more

You abominable fellow cried Ignat to him one day Say who are you

The priest was frightened by the call and bowing low to Ignat was
silent

Who Speak roared Ignat

I am a manto be abused answered the priest and the company burst
out laughing at his words

Are you a rascal asked Ignat sternly

A rascal Because of need and the weakness of my soul

Come here Ignat called him Come and sit down by my side

Trembling with fear the priest walked up to the intoxicated merchant
with timid steps and remained standing opposite him

Sit down beside me said Ignat taking the frightened priest by the
hand and seating him next to himself You are a very near man to me I
am also a rascal You because of need I because of wantonness I am a
rascal because of grief Understand

I understand said the priest softly All the company were giggling

Do you know now what I am

I do

Well say You are a rascal Ignat

The priest could not do it He looked with terror at the huge figure of
Ignat and shook his head negatively The companys laughter was now like
the rattling of thunder Ignat could not make the priest abuse him Then
he asked him

Shall I give you money

Yes quickly answered the priest

And what do you need it for

He did not care to answer Then Ignat seized him by the collar and
shook out of his dirty lips the following speech which he spoke almost
in a whisper trembling with fear

I have a daughter sixteen years old in the seminary I save for her
because when she comes out there wont be anything with which to cover
her nakedness

Ah said Ignat and let go the priests collar Then he sat for a long
time gloomy and lost in thought and now and again stared at the priest
Suddenly his eyes began to laugh and he said

Arent you a liar drunkard

The priest silently made the sign of the cross and lowered his head on
his breast

It is the truth said one of the company confirming the priests
words

True Very well shouted Ignat and striking the table with his fist
he addressed himself to the priest

Eh you Sell me your daughter How much will you take

The priest shook his head and shrank back

One thousand

The company giggled seeing that the priest was shrinking as though cold
water was being poured on him

Two roared Ignat with flashing eyes

Whats the matter with you How is it muttered the priest stretching
out both hands to Ignat

Three

Ignat Matveyich cried the priest in a thin ringing voice For
Gods sake For Christs sake Enough Ill sell her For her own sake
Ill sell her

In his sickly sharp voice was heard a threat to someone and his eyes
unnoticed by anybody before flashed like coals But the intoxicated
crowd only laughed at him foolishly

Silence cried Ignat sternly straightening himself to his full
length and flashing his eyes

Dont you understand devils whats going on here Its enough to make
one cry while you giggle

He walked up to the priest went down on his knees before him and said
to him firmly

Father now you see what a rascal I am Well spit into my face

Something ugly and ridiculous took place The priest too knelt before
Ignat and like a huge turtle crept around near his feet kissed his
knees and muttered something sobbing Ignat bent over him lifted him
from the floor and cried to him commanding and begging

Spit Spit right into my shameless eyes

The company stupefied for a moment by Ignats stern voice laughed
again so that the panes rattled in the tavern windows

Ill give you a hundred roubles Spit

And the priest crept over the floor and sobbed for fear or for
happiness to hear that this man was begging him to do something
degrading to himself

Finally Ignat arose from the floor kicked the priest and flinging at
him a package of money said morosely with a smile

Rabble Can a man repent before such people Some are afraid to hear
of repentance others laugh at a sinner I was about to unburden myself
completely the heart trembled Let me I thought No I didnt think at
all Just so Get out of here And see that you never show yourself to
me again Do you hear

Oh a queer fellow said the crowd somewhat moved

Legends were composed about his drinking bouts in town everybody
censured him strictly but no one ever declined his invitation to those
drinking bouts Thus he lived for weeks

And unexpectedly he used to come home not yet altogether freed from
the odour of the kabaks but already crestfallen and quiet With humbly
downcast eyes in which shame was burning now he silently listened to
his wifes reproaches and humble and meek as a lamb went away to his
room and locked himself in For many hours in succession he knelt before
the cross lowering his head on his breast his hands hung helplessly
his back was bent and he was silent as though he dared not pray His
wife used to come up to the door on tiptoe and listen Deep sighs were
heard from behind the doorlike the breathing of a tired and sickly
horse

God You see whispered Ignat in a muffled voice firmly pressing the
palms of his hands to his broad breast

During the days of repentance he drank nothing but water and ate only
rye bread

In the morning his wife placed at the door of his room a big bottle of
water about a pound and a half of bread and salt He opened the door
took in these victuals and locked himself in again During this time he
was not disturbed in any way everybody tried to avoid him A few days
later he again appeared on the exchange jested laughed made contracts
to furnish corn as sharpsighted as a bird of prey a rare expert at
anything concerning his affairs

But in all the moods of Ignats life there was one passionate desire
that never left himthe desire to have a son and the older he grew the
greater was this desire Very often such conversation as this took place
between him and his wife In the morning at her tea or at noon during
dinner hour he gloomily glared at his wife a stout wellfed woman
with a red face and sleepy eyes and asked her

Well dont you feel anything

She knew what he meant but she invariably replied

How can I help feeling Your fists are like dumbbells

You know what Im talking about you fool

Can one become pregnant from such blows

Its not on account of the blows that you dont bear any children
its because you eat too much You fill your stomach with all sorts of
foodand theres no room for the child to engender

As if I didnt bear you any children

Those were girls said Ignat reproachfully I want a son Do you
understand A son an heir To whom shall I give my capital after my
death Who shall pray for my sins Shall I give it to a cloister I have
given them enough Or shall I leave it to you What a fine pilgrim you
are Even in church you think only of fish pies If I die youll marry
again and my money will be turned over to some fool Do you think this
is what I am working for

And he was seized with sardonic anguish for he felt that his life was
aimless if he should have no son to follow him

During the nine years of their married life his wife had borne him four
daughters all of whom had passed away While Ignat had awaited their
birth tremblingly he mourned their death but littleat any rate they
were unnecessary to him He began to beat his wife during the second
year of their married life at first he did it while being intoxicated
and without animosity but just according to the proverb Love your
wife like your soul and shake her like a peartree but after each
confinement deceived in his expectation his hatred for his wife grew
stronger and he began to beat her with pleasure in revenge for not
bearing him a son

Once while on business in the province of Samarsk he received a
telegram from relatives at home informing him of his wifes death
He made the sign of the cross thought awhile and wrote to his friend
Mayakin

Bury her in my absence look after my property

Then he went to the church to serve the mass for the dead and having
prayed for the repose of the late Aquilinas soul he began to think
that it was necessary for him to marry as soon as possible

He was then fortythree years old tall broadshouldered with a heavy
bass voice like an archdeacon his large eyes looked bold and wise
from under his dark eyebrows in his sunburnt face overgrown with a
thick black beard and in all his mighty figure there was much truly
Russian crude and healthy beauty in his easy motions as well as in
his slow proud walk a consciousness of power was evidenta firm
confidence in himself He was liked by women and did not avoid them

Ere six months had passed after the death of his wife he courted the
daughter of an Ural Cossack The father of the bride notwithstanding
that Ignat was known even in Ural as a pranky man gave him his
daughter in marriage and toward autumn Ignat Gordyeeff came home with
a young Cossackwife Her name was Natalya Tall wellbuilt with large
blue eyes and with a long chestnut braid she was a worthy match for the
handsome Ignat He was happy and proud of his wife and loved her with
the passionate love of a healthy man but he soon began to contemplate
her thoughtfully with a vigilant eye

Seldom did a smile cross the oval demure face of his wifeshe was
always thinking of something foreign to life and in her calm blue eyes
something dark and misanthropic was flashing at times Whenever she was
free from household duties she seated herself in the most spacious room
by the window and sat there silently for two or three hours Her
face was turned toward the street but the look of her eyes was so
indifferent to everything that lived and moved there beyond the window
and at the same time it was so fixedly deep as though she were looking
into her very soul And her walk too was queer Natalya moved about
the spacious room slowly and carefully as if something invisible
restrained the freedom of her movements Their house was filled with
heavy and coarsely boastful luxury everything there was resplendent
screaming of the proprietors wealth but the Cossackwife walked past
the costly furniture and the silverware in a shy and somewhat frightened
manner as though fearing lest they might seize and choke her
Evidently the noisy life of the big commercial town did not interest
this silent woman and whenever she went out driving with her husband
her eyes were fixed on the back of the driver When her husband took
her visiting she went and behaved there just as queerly as at home when
guests came to her house she zealously served them refreshments taking
no interest whatever in what was said and showing preference toward
none Only Mayakin a witty droll man at times called forth on her
face a smile as vague as a shadow He used to say of her

Its a treenot a woman But life is like an inextinguishable
woodpile and every one of us blazes up sometimes She too will take
fire wait give her time Then we shall see how she will bloom

Eh Ignat used to say to her jestingly What are you thinking about
Are you homesick Brighten up a bit

She would remain silent calmly looking at him

You go entirely too often to the church You should wait You have
plenty of time to pray for your sins Commit the sins first You know
if you dont sin you dont repent if you dont repent you dont work
out your salvation You better sin while you are young Shall we go out
for a drive

I dont feel like going out

He used to sit down beside her and embrace her She was cold returning
his caresses but sparingly Looking straight into her eyes he used to
say

Natalya Tell mewhy are you so sad Do you feel lonesome here with
me

No she replied shortly

What then is it Are you longing for your people

No its nothing

What are you thinking about

I am not thinking

What then

Oh nothing

Once he managed to get from her a more complete answer

There is something confused in my heart And also in my eyes And it
always seems to me that all this is not real

She waved her hand around her pointing at the walls the furniture and
everything Ignat did not reflect on her words and laughing said to
her

Thats to no purpose Everything here is genuine All these are costly
solid things If you dont want these Ill burn them Ill sell them
Ill give them awayand Ill get new ones Do you want me to

What for said she calmly

He wondered at last how one so young and healthy could live as though
she were sleeping all the time caring for nothing going nowhere
except to the church and shunning everybody And he used to console
her

Just wait Youll bear a son and then an altogether different life
will commence You are so sad because you have so little anxiety and he
will give you trouble Youll bear me a son will you not

If it pleases God she answered lowering her head

Then her mood began to irritate him

Well why do you wear such a long face You walk as though on glass
You look as if you had ruined somebodys soul Eh You are such a
succulent woman and yet you have no taste for anything Fool

Coming home intoxicated one day he began to ply her with caresses
while she turned away from him Then he grew angry and exclaimed

Natalya Dont play the fool look out

She turned her face to him and asked calmly

What then

Ignat became enraged at these words and at her fearless look

What he roared coming up close to her

Do you wish to kill me asked she not moving from her place nor
winking an eye

Ignat was accustomed to seeing people tremble before his wrath and it
was strange and offensive to him to see her calm

There he cried lifting his hand to strike her Slowly but in time
she eluded the blow then she seized his hand pushed it away from her
and said in the same tone

Dont you dare to touch me I will not allow you to come near me

Her eyes became smaller and their sharp metallic glitter sobered Ignat
He understood by her face that she too was a strong beast and if she
chose to she wouldnt admit him to her even though she were to lose her
life

Oh he growled and went away

But having retreated once he would not do it again he could not bear
that a woman and his wife at that should not bow before himthis
would have degraded him He then began to realise that henceforth his
wife would never yield to him in any matter and that an obstinate
strife for predominance must start between them

Very well Well see who will conquer he thought the next day
watching his wife with stern curiosity and in his soul a strong desire
was already raging to start the strife that he might enjoy his victory
the sooner

But about four days later Natalya Fominichna announced to her husband
that she was pregnant

Ignat trembled for joy embraced her firmly and said in a dull voice

Youre a fine fellow Natalya Natasha if it should be a son If you
bear me a son Ill enrich you I tell you plainly Ill be your slave
By God Ill lie down at your feet and you may trample upon me if you
like

This is not within our power its the will of the Lord said she in a
low voice

Yes the Lords exclaimed Ignat with bitterness and drooped his head
sadly

From that moment he began to look after his wife as though she were a
little child

Why do you sit near the window Look out Youll catch cold in your
side you may take sick he used to say to her both sternly and
mildly Why do you skip on the staircase You may hurt yourself And
you had better eat more eat for two that he may have enough

And the pregnancy made Natalya more morose and silent as though she
were looking still deeper into herself absorbed in the throbbing of new
life within her But the smile on her lips became clearer and in her
eyes flashed at times something new weak and timid like the first ray
of the dawn

When at last the time of confinement came it was early on an autumn
morning At the first cry of pain she uttered Ignat turned pale and
started to say something but only waved his hand and left the bedroom
where his wife was shrinking convulsively and went down to the little
room which had served his late mother as a chapel He ordered vodka
seated himself by the table and began to drink sternly listening to the
alarm in the house and to the moans of his wife that came from above In
the corner of the room the images of the ikons indifferent and dark
stood out confusedly dimly illumined by the glimmering light of the
image lamp There was a stamping and scraping of feet over his head
something heavy was moved from one side of the floor to the other there
was a clattering of dishes people were bustling hurriedly up and down
the staircase Everything was being done in haste yet time was creeping
slowly Ignat could hear a muffled voice from above

As it seems she cannot be delivered that way We had better send to
the church to open the gates of the Lord

Vassushka one of the hangerson in his house entered the room next to
Ignats and began to pray in a loud whisper

God our Lord descend from the skies in Thy benevolence born of
the Holy Virgin Thou dost divine the helplessness of human creatures
Forgive Thy servant

And suddenly drowning all other sounds a superhuman soulrending cry
rang out and a continuous moan floated softly over the room and died
out in the corners which were filled now with the twilight Ignat cast
stern glances at the ikons heaved a deep sigh and thought

Is it possible that its again a daughter

At times he arose stupidly stood in the middle of the room and crossed
himself in silence bowing before the ikons then he went back to the
table drank the vodka which had not made him dizzy during these hours
dozed off and thus passed the whole night and following morning until
noon

And then at last the midwife came down hastily crying to him in a
thin joyous voice

I congratulate you with a son Ignat Matveyich

You lie said he in a dull voice Whats the matter with you
batushka Heaving a sigh with all the strength of his massive chest
Ignat went down on his knees and clasping his hands firmly to his
breast muttered in a trembling voice

Thank God Evidently Thou didst not want that my stem should be
checked My sins before Thee shall not remain without repentance I
thank Thee Oh Lord Oh and rising to his feet he immediately began
to command noisily

Eh Let someone go to St Nicholas for a priest Tell him that Ignat
Matveyich asked him to come Let him come to make a prayer for the
woman

The chambermaid appeared and said to him with alarm

Ignat Matveyich Natalya Fominichna is calling you She is feeling
bad

Why bad Itll pass he roared his eyes flashing cheerfully Tell
her Ill be there immediately Tell her shes a fine fellow Ill just
get a present for her and Ill come Hold on Prepare something to eat
for the priest Send somebody after Mayakin

His enormous figure looked as though it had grown bigger and
intoxicated with joy he stupidly tossed about the room he was smiling
rubbing his hands and casting fervent glances at the images he crossed
himself swinging his hand wide At last he went up to his wife

His eyes first of all caught a glimpse of the little red body which the
midwife was bathing in a tub Noticing him Ignat stood up on tiptoes
and folding his hands behind his back walked up to him stepping
carefully and comically putting forth his lips The little one was
whimpering and sprawling in the water naked impotent and pitiful

Look out there Handle him more carefully He hasnt got any bones
yet said Ignat to the midwife softly

She began to laugh opening her toothless mouth and cleverly throwing
the child over from one hand to the other

You better go to your wife

He obediently moved toward the bed and asked on his way

Well how is it Natalya

Then on reaching her he drew back the bed curtain which had thrown a
shadow over the bed

Ill not survive this said she in a low hoarse voice

Ignat was silent fixedly staring at his wifes face sunk in the white
pillow over which her dark locks were spread out like dead snakes
Yellow lifeless with black circles around her large wideopen
eyesher face was strange to him And the glance of those terrible
eyes motionlessly fixed somewhere in the distance through the
wallthat too was unfamiliar to Ignat His heart compressed by a
painful foreboding slackened its joyous throbbing

Thats nothing Thats nothing Its always like this said he softly
bending over his wife to give her a kiss But she moaned right into his
face

Ill not survive this

Her lips were gray and cold and when he touched them with his own he
understood that death was already within her

Oh Lord he uttered in an alarmed whisper feeling that fright was
choking his throat and suppressing his breath

Natasha What will become of him He must be nursed What is the matter
with you

He almost began to cry at his wife The midwife was bustling about him
shaking the crying child in the air She spoke to him reassuringly but
he heard nothinghe could not turn his eyes away from the frightful
face of his wife Her lips were moving and he heard words spoken in
a low voice but could not understand them Sitting on the edge of the
bed he spoke in a dull and timid voice Just think of it He cannot
do without you hes an infant Gather strength Drive this thought away
from you Drive it away

He talked yet he understood he was speaking useless words Tears welled
up within him and in his breast there came a feeling heavy as stone and
cold as ice

Forgive me Goodbye Take care Look out Dont drink whispered
Natalya soundlessly

The priest came and covering her face with something and sighing
began to read gentle beseeching words

Oh God Almighty Lord who cureth every disease cure also Thy servant
Natalya who has just given birth to a child and restore her from the
bed on which she now lies for in the words of David We indulge in
lawlessness and are wicked in Thine eyes

The old mans voice was interrupted now and then his thin face was
stern and from his clothes came the odour of rockrose

Guard the infant born of her guard him from all possible temptation
from all possible cruelty from all possible storms from evil spirits
night and day

Ignat listened to the prayer and wept silently His big hot tears fell
on the bare hand of his wife But the hand evidently did not feel that
the tears were dropping upon it it remained motionless and the skin
did not tremble from the fall of the tears After the prayer Natalya
became unconscious and a day later she died without saying another
wordshe died just as quietly as she had lived Having arranged
a pompous funeral Ignat christened his son named him Foma and
unwillingly gave his boy into the family of the godfather his old
friend Mayakin whose wife too had given birth to a child not long
before The death of his wife had sown many gray hairs in Ignats dark
beard but in the stern glitter of his eyes appeared a new expression
gentle clear and mild



CHAPTER II

MAYAKIN lived in an enormous twostory house near a big palisade where
sturdy old spreading linden trees were growing magnificently The rank
branches covered the windows with a dense dark embroidery and the sun
in broken rays peeped into the small rooms which were closely crowded
with miscellaneous furniture and big trunks wherefore a stern and
melancholy semidarkness always reigned there supreme The family was
devoutthe odour of wax of rockrose and of imagelamp oil filled the
house and penitent sighs and prayers soared about in the air Religious
ceremonials were performed infallibly with pleasure absorbing all the
free power of the souls of the dwellers of the house Feminine figures
almost noiselessly moved about the rooms in the halfdark stifling
heavy atmosphere They were dressed in black wore soft slippers on
their feet and always had a penitent look on their faces

The family of Yakov Tarazovich Mayakin consisted of himself his wife a
daughter and five kinswomen the youngest of whom was thirtyfour years
old These were alike devout and impersonal and subordinate to Antonina
Ivanovna the mistress of the house She was a tall thin woman with
a dark face and with stern gray eyes which had an imperious and
intelligent expression Mayakin also had a son Taras but his name
was never mentioned in the house acquaintances knew that since the
nineteenyearold Taras had gone to study in Moscowhe married there
three years later against his fathers willYakov disowned him Taras
disappeared without leaving any trace It was rumoured that he had been
sent to Siberia for something

Yakov Mayakin was very queerly built Short thin lively with a little
red beard sly greenish eyes he looked as though he said to each and
every one

Never mind sir dont be uneasy Even though I know you for what you
are if you dont annoy me I will not give you away

His beard resembled an egg in shape and was monstrously big His high
forehead covered with wrinkles joined his bald crown and it seemed
as though he really had two facesone an open penetrating and
intellectual face with a long gristle nose and above this face another
one eyeless and mouthless covered with wrinkles behind which Mayakin
seemed to hide his eyes and his lips until a certain time and when that
time had arrived he would look at the world with different eyes and
smile a different smile

He was the owner of a ropeyard and kept a store in town near the
harbour In this store filled up to the ceiling with rope twine hemp
and tow he had a small room with a creaking glass door In this room
stood a big old dilapidated table and near it a deep armchair
covered with oilcloth in which Mayakin sat all day long sipping
tea and always reading the same Moskovskiya Vedomosty to which he
subscribed year in and year out all his life Among merchants he
enjoyed the respect and reputation of a brainy man and he was very
fond of boasting of the antiquity of his race saying in a hoarse voice

We the Mayakins were merchants during the reign of Mother
Catherine consequently I am a pureblooded man

In this family Ignat Gordyeeffs son lived for six years By the time
he was seven years old Foma was a bigheaded broadshouldered boy
seemingly older that his years both in his size and in the serious look
of his dark almondshaped eyes Quiet silent and persistent in his
childish desires he spent all his days over his playthings with
Mayakins daughter Luba quietly looked after by one of the kinswomen
a stout pockmarked old maid who was for some reason or other
nicknamed Buzya She was a dull somewhat timid creature and even to
the children she spoke in a low voice in words of monosyllables Having
devoted her time to learning prayers she had no stories to tell Foma

Foma was on friendly terms with the little girl but when she angered
or teased him he turned pale his nostrils became distended his eyes
stared comically and he beat her audaciously She cried ran to her
mother and complained to her but Antonina loved Foma and she paid but
little attention to her daughters complaints which strengthened the
friendship between the children still more Fomas day was long and
uniform Getting out of bed and washing himself he used to place
himself before the image and under the whispering of the pockmarked
Buzya he recited long prayers Then they drank tea and ate many
biscuits cakes and pies After teaduring the summerthe children
went to the big palisade which ran down to a ravine whose bottom
always looked dark and damp filling them with terror The children were
not allowed to go even to the edge of the ravine and this inspired in
them a fear of it In winter from tea time to dinner they played in
the house when it was very cold outside or went out in the yard to
slide down the big ice hill

They had dinner at noon in Russian style as Mayakin said At first a
big bowl of fat sour cabbage soup was served with rye biscuits in
but without meat then the same soup was eaten with meat cut into small
pieces then they ate roast meatpork goose veal or rennet with
gruelthen again a bowl of soup with vermicelli and all this was
usually followed by dessert They drank kvass made of red bilberries
juniperberries or of breadAntonina Ivanovna always carried a stock
of different kinds of kvass They ate in silence only now and then
uttering a sigh of fatigue the children each ate out of a separate
bowl the adults eating out of one bowl Stupefied by such a dinner
they went to sleep and for two or three hours Mayakins house was
filled with snoring and with drowsy sighs

Awaking from sleep they drank tea and talked about local news the
choristers the deacons weddings or the dishonourable conduct of this
or that merchant After tea Mayakin used to say to his wife

Well mother hand me the Bible

Yakov Tarasovich used to read the Book of Job more often than anything
else Putting his heavy silverframed spectacles on his big ravenous
nose he looked around at his listeners to see whether all were in their
places

They were all seated where he was accustomed to see them and on their
faces was a familiar dull and timid expression of piety

There was a man in the land of Uz began Mayakin in a hoarse voice
and Foma sitting beside Luba on the lounge in the corner of the room
knew beforehand that soon his godfather would become silent and pat his
bald head with his hand He sat and listening pictured to himself
this man from the land of Uz The man was tall and bare his eyes were
enormously large like those of the image of the Saviour and his voice
was like a big brass trumpet on which the soldiers played in the camps
The man was constantly growing bigger and bigger and reaching the sky
he thrust his dark hands into the clouds and tearing them asunder
cried out in a terrible voice

Why is light given to a man whose way is hid and whom God hath hedged
in

Dread fell on Foma and he trembled slumber fled from his eyes he
heard the voice of his godfather who said with a light smile now and
then pinching his beard

See how audacious he was

The boy knew that his godfather spoke of the man from the land of Uz
and the godfathers smile soothed the child So the man would not break
the sky he would not rend it asunder with his terrible arms And then
Foma sees the man againhe sits on the ground his flesh is clothed
with worms and clods of dust his skin is broken But now he is small
and wretched he is like a beggar at the church porch

Here he says

What is man that he should be clean And he which is born of woman
that he should be righteous These words attributed by Mayakin to Job
are from Eliphaz the Temanites replyTranslators Note

He says this to God explained Mayakin inspired How says he can I
be righteous since I am made of flesh Thats a question asked of God
How is that

And the reader triumphantly and interrogatively looks around at his
listeners

He merited it the righteous man they replied with a sigh

Yakov Mayakin eyes them with a smile and says

Fools You better put the children to sleep

Ignat visited the Mayakins every day brought playthings for his son
caught him up into his arms and hugged him but sometimes dissatisfied
he said to him with illconcealed uneasiness

Why are you such a bugbear Oh Why do you laugh so little

And he would complain to the lads godfather

I am afraid that he may turn out to be like his mother His eyes are
cheerless

You disturb yourself rather too soon Mayakin smilingly replied

He too loved his godson and when Ignat announced to him one day that
he would take Foma to his own house Mayakin was very much grieved

Leave him here he begged See the child is used to us there hes
crying

Hell cease crying I did not beget him for you The air of the
place is disagreeable It is as tedious here as in an old believers
hermitage This is harmful to the child And without him I am lonesome
I come homeit is empty I can see nothing there It would not do for
me to remove to your house for his sake I am not for him he is for me
So And now that my sister has come to my house there will be somebody
to look after him

And the boy was brought to his fathers house

There he was met by a comical old woman with a long hooklike nose and
with a mouth devoid of teeth Tall stooping dressed in gray with gray
hair covered by a black silk cap she did not please the boy at first
she even frightened him But when he noticed on the wrinkled face her
black eyes which beamed so tenderly on him he at once pressed his head
close to her knees in confidence

My sickly little orphan she said in a velvetlike voice that trembled
from the fulness of sound and quietly patted his face with her hand
stay close to me my dear child

There was something particularly sweet and soft in her caresses
something altogether new to Foma and he stared into the old womans
eyes with curiosity and expectation on his face This old woman led him
into a new world hitherto unknown to him The very first day having
put him to bed she seated herself by his side and bending over the
child asked him

Shall I tell you a story Fomushka

And after that Foma always fell asleep amid the velvetlike sounds of
the old womans voice which painted before him a magic life Giants
defeating monsters wise princesses fools who turned out to be
wisetroops of new and wonderful people were passing before the boys
bewitched imagination and his soul was nourished by the wholesome
beauty of the national creative power Inexhaustible were the treasures
of the memory and the fantasy of this old woman who oftentimes
in slumber appeared to the boynow like the witch of the
fairytalesonly a kind and amiable old witchnow like the beautiful
allwise Vasilisa His eyes wide open holding his breath the boy
looked into the darkness that filled his chamber and watched it as it
slowly trembled in the light of the little lamp that was burning before
the image And Foma filled this darkness with wonderful pictures of
fairytale life Silent yet living shadows were creeping over the
walls and across the floor it was both pleasant and terrible to him to
watch their life to deal out unto them forms and colours and having
endowed them with life instantly to destroy them all with a single
twinkle of the eyelashes Something new appeared in his dark eyes
something more childish and naive less grave the loneliness and the
darkness awaking in him a painful feeling of expectation stirred his
curiosity compelled him to go out to the dark corner and see what
was hidden there beyond the thick veils of darkness He went and found
nothing but he lost no hope of finding it out

He feared his father and respected him Ignats enormous size his
harsh trumpetlike voice his bearded face his grayhaired head his
powerful long arms and his flashing eyesall these gave to Ignat the
resemblance of the fairytale robbers

Foma shuddered whenever he heard his voice or his heavy firm steps but
when the father smiling kindheartedly and talking playfully in a loud
voice took him upon his knees or threw him high up in the air with his
big hands the boys fear vanished

Once when the boy was about eight years old he asked his father who
had returned from a long journey

Papa where were you

On the Volga

Were you robbing there asked Foma softly

Whaat Ignat drawled out and his eyebrows contracted

Arent you a robber papa I know it said Foma winking his eyes
slyly satisfied that he had already read the secret of his fathers
life

I am a merchant said Ignat sternly but after a moments thought he
smiled kindheartedly and added And you are a little fool I deal in
corn I run a line of steamers Have you seen the Yermak Well that
is my steamer And yours too

It is a very big one said Foma with a sigh

Well Ill buy you a small one while you are small yourself Shall I

Very well Foma assented but after a thoughtful silence he again
drawled out regretfully But I thought you were a robber or a giant

I tell you I am a merchant repeated Ignat insinuatingly and there
was something discontented and almost timorous in his glance at the
disenchanted face of his son

Like Grandpa Fedor the Kalatch baker asked Foma having thought
awhile

Well yes like him Only I am richer than he I have more money than
Fedor

Have you much money

Well some people have still more

How many barrels do you have

Of what

Of money I mean

Fool Is money counted by the barrel

How else exclaimed Foma enthusiastically and turning his face
toward his father began to tell him quickly Maksimka the robber
came once to a certain town and filled up twelve barrels with money
belonging to some rich man there And he took different silverware and
robbed a church And cut up a man with his sword and threw him down the
steeple because he tried to sound an alarm

Did your aunt tell you that asked Ignat admiring his sons
enthusiasm

Yes Why

Nothing said Ignat laughing So you thought your father was a
robber

And perhaps you were a robber long ago

Foma again returned to his theme and it was evident on his face that he
would be very glad to hear an affirmative answer

I was never a robber Let that end it

Never

I tell you I was not What a queer little boy you are Is it good to
be a robber They are all sinners the robbers They dont believe in
Godthey rob churches They are all cursed in the churches Yes Look
here my son youll have to start to study soon It is time youll
soon be nine years old Start with the help of God Youll study during
the winter and in spring Ill take you along with me on the Volga

Will I go to school asked Foma timidly

First youll study at home with auntie Soon after the boy would sit
down near the table in the morning and fingering the Slavonic alphabet
repeat after his aunt

Az Buky Vedy

When they reached bra vra gra dra for a long time the boy could not
read these syllables without laughter Foma succeeded easily in gaining
knowledge almost without any effort and soon he was reading the first
psalm of the first section of the psalter Blessed is the man that
walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly

Thats it my darling So Fomushka thats right chimed in his aunt
with emotion enraptured by his progress

Youre a fine fellow Foma Ignat would approvingly say when informed
of his sons progress Well go to Astrakhan for fish in the spring
and toward autumn Ill send you to school

The boys life rolled onward like a ball downhill Being his teacher
his aunt was his playmate as well Luba Mayakin used to come and when
with them the old woman readily became one of them

They played at hide and seek and blind mans buff the children
were pleased and amused at seeing Anfisa her eyes covered with a
handkerchief her arms outstretched walking about the room carefully
and yet striking against chairs and tables or looking for them in each
and every commodious corner saying

Eh little rascals Eh rogues Where have they hidden themselves Eh

And the sun shone cheerfully and playfully upon the old wornout body
which yet retained a youthful soul and upon the old life that was
adorning according to its strength and abilities the lifepath of two
children

Ignat used to go to the Exchange early in the morning and sometimes
stayed away until evening in the evening he used to go to the
town council or visiting or elsewhere Sometimes he returned home
intoxicated At first Foma on such occasions ran from him and hid
himself then he became accustomed to it and learned that his father
was better when drunk than sober he was kinder and plainer and was
somewhat comical If it happened at night the boy was usually awakened
by his trumpetlike voice

Anfisa Dear sister Let me in to my son let me in to my successor

And auntie answered him in a crying and reproachful voice

Go on You better go to sleep you cursed devil Drunk again eh You
are gray already

Anfisa May I see my son with one eye Foma knew that Anfisa would
not let him in and he again fell asleep in spite of the noise of
their voices But when Ignat came home intoxicated during the day he
immediately seized his son with his enormous paws and carried him about
the rooms asking him with an intoxicated happy laughter

Fomka What do you wish Speak Presents Playthings Ask Because you
must know theres nothing in this world that I wouldnt buy for you I
have a million Ha ha ha And Ill have still more Understand Alls
yours Ha ha

And suddenly his enthusiasm was extinguished like a candle put out by
a violent puff of the wind His flushed face began to shake his eyes
burning red filled with tears and his lips expanded into a sad and
frightened smile

Anfisa in case he should die what am I to do then

And immediately after these words he was seized with fury

Id burn everything he roared staring wildly into some dark corner
of the room Id destroy everything Id blow it up with dynamite

Enough you ugly brute Do you wish to frighten the child Or do you
want him to take sick interposed Anfisa and that was sufficient for
Ignat to rush off hastily muttering

Well well well I am going I am going but dont cry Dont make any
noise Dont frighten him

And when Foma was somewhat sick his father casting everything aside
did not leave the house for a moment but bothered his sister and his
son with stupid questions and advice gloomy sighing and with fear in
his eyes he walked about the house quite out of sorts

Why do you vex the Lord said Anfisa Beware your grumblings will
reach Him and He will punish you for your complaints against His
graces

Eh sister sighed Ignat And if it should happen My entire life is
crumbling away Wherefore have I lived No one knows

Similar scenes and the striking transitions of his father from one mood
to another frightened the child at first but he soon became accustomed
to all this and when he noticed through the window that his father
on coming home was hardly able to get out of the sledge Foma said
indifferently

Auntie papa came home drunk again



Spring came and fulfilling his promise Ignat took his son along on
one of his steamers and here a new life abounding in impressions was
opened before Fomas eyes

The beautiful and mighty Yermak Gordyeeffs steam towboat was
rapidly floating down the current and on each side the shores of the
powerful and beautiful Volga were slowly moving past himthe left side
all bathed in sunshine stretching itself to the very end of the sky
like a pompous carpet of verdure the right shore its high banks
overgrown with woods swung skyward sinking in stern repose

The broadbosomed river stretched itself majestically between the
shores noiselessly solemnly and slowly flowed its waters conscious of
their invincible power the mountainous shore is reflected in the water
in a black shadow while on the left side it is adorned with gold and
with verdant velvet by a border of sand and the wide meadows Here and
there villages appear on mountain and on meadow the sun shines bright
on the windowpanes of the huts and on the yellow roofs of straw the
church crosses sparkle amid the verdure of the trees gray windmill
wings revolve lazily in the air smoke from the factory chimney rises
skyward in thick black curling clouds Crowds of children in blue red
or white shirts standing on the banks shouted loudly at the sight of
the steamer which had disturbed the quiet of the river and from under
the steamers wheels the cheerful waves are rushing toward the feet
of the children and splash against the bank Now a crowd of children
seated in a boat rowed toward the middle of the river to rock there
on the waves as in a cradle Trees stood out above the water sometimes
many of them are drowned in the overflow of the banks and these stand
in the water like islands From the shore a melancholy song is heard

Oh ooo once more

The steamer passes many rafts splashing them with waves The beams are
in continual motion under the blows of the waves the men on the rafts
in blue shirts staggering look at the steamer and laugh and shout
something The big beautiful vessel goes sidewise on the river the
yellow scantlings with which it is loaded sparkle like gold and are
dimly reflected in the muddy vernal water A passenger steamer comes
from the opposite side and whistlesthe resounding echo of the whistle
loses itself in the woods in the gorges of the mountainous bank and
dies away there In the middle of the river the waves stirred up by the
two vessels strike against one another and splash against the steamers
sides and the vessels are rocked upon the water On the slope of the
mountainous bank are verdant carpets of winter corn brown strips of
fallow ground and black strips of ground tilled for spring corn Birds
like little dots soar over them and are clearly seen in the blue
canopy of the sky nearby a flock is grazing in the distance they look
like childrens toys the small figure of the shepherd stands leaning on
a staff and looks at the river

The glare of the waterfreedom and liberty are everywhere the meadows
are cheerfully verdant and the blue sky is tenderly clear a restrained
power is felt in the quiet motion of the water above it the generous
May sun is shining the air is filled with the exquisite odour of
fir trees and of fresh foliage And the banks keep on meeting them
caressing the eyes and the soul with their beauty as new pictures
constantly unfold themselves

Everything surrounding them bears the stamp of some kind of tardiness
allnature as well as menlive there clumsily lazily but in that
laziness there is an odd gracefulness and it seems as though beyond the
laziness a colossal power were concealed an invincible power but as
yet deprived of consciousness as yet without any definite desires and
aims And the absence of consciousness in this halfslumbering life
throws shades of sadness over all the beautiful slope Submissive
patience silent hope for something new and more inspiriting are heard
even in the cry of the cuckoo wafted to the river by the wind from the
shore The melancholy songs sound as though imploring someone for help
And at times there is in them a ring of despair The river answers the
songs with sighs And the treetops shake lost in meditation Silence

Foma spent all day long on the captains bridge beside his father
Without uttering a word he stared wideeyed at the endless panorama of
the banks and it seemed to him he was moving along a broad silver path
in those wonderful kingdoms inhabited by the sorcerers and giants of his
familiar fairytales At times he would load his father with questions
about everything that passed before them Ignat answered him willingly
and concisely but the boy was not pleased with his answers they
contained nothing interesting and intelligible to him and he did not
hear what he longed to hear Once he told his father with a sigh

Auntie Anfisa knows better than you

What does she know asked Ignat smiling

Everything replied the boy convincedly

No wonderful kingdom appeared before him But often cities appeared on
the banks of the river just such cities as the one where Foma lived
Some of them were larger some smaller but the people and the houses
and the churchesall were the same as in his own city Foma examined
them in company with his father but was still unsatisfied and returned
to the steamer gloomy and fatigued

Tomorrow we shall be in Astrakhan said Ignat one day

And is it just the same as the other cities

Of course How else should it be

And what is beyond Astrakhan

The sea The Caspian Sea it is called

And what is there

Fishes queer fellow What else can there be in the water

Theres the city Kitezh standing in the water

Thats a different thing Thats Kitezh Only righteous people live
there

And are there no righteous cities on the sea

No said Ignat and after a moments silence added The sea water is
bitter and nobody can drink it

And is there more land beyond the sea

Certainly the sea must have an end It is like a cup

And are there cities there too

Again cities Of course Only that land is not ours it belongs to
Persia Did you see the Persians selling pistachionuts and apricots in
the market

Yes I saw them replied Foma and became pensive

One day he asked his father

Is there much more land left

The earth is very big my dear If you should go on foot you couldnt
go around it even in ten years

Ignat talked for a long time with his son about the size of the earth
and said at length

And yet no one knows for certain how big it really is nor where it
ends

And is everything alike on earth

What do you mean

The cities and all

Well of course the cities are like cities There are houses
streetsand everything that is necessary

After many similar conversations the boy no longer stared so often into
the distance with the interrogative look of his black eyes

The crew of the steamer loved him and he too loved those fine
sunburnt and weatherbeaten fellows who laughingly played with him
They made fishing tackles for him and little boats out of bark played
with him and rowed him about the anchoring place when Ignat went to
town on business The boy often heard the men talking about his father
but he paid no attention to what they said and never told his father
what he heard about him But one day in Astrakhan while the steamer
was taking in a cargo of fuel Foma heard the voice of Petrovich the
machinist

He ordered such a lot of wood to be taken in What an absurd man First
he loads the steamer up to the very deck and then he roars You
break the machinery too often he says You pour oil he says at
random

The voice of the gray and stern pilot replied

Its all his exorbitant greediness Fuel is cheaper here so he is
taking all he can He is greedy the devil

Oh how greedy

This word repeated many times in succession fixed itself in Fomas
memory and in the evening at supper he suddenly asked his father

Papa

What

Are you greedy

In reply to his fathers questions Foma told him of the conversation
between the pilot and the machinist Ignats face became gloomy and his
eyes began to flash angrily

Thats how it is ejaculated Ignat shaking his head Well
youdont you listen to them They are not your equals dont have
so much to do with them You are their master they are your servants
understand that If we choose to we can put every one of them ashore
They are cheap and they can be found everywhere like dogs Understand
They may say many bad things about me But they say them because I am
their master The whole thing arises because I am fortunate and rich
and the rich are always envied A happy man is everybodys enemy

About two days later there was a new pilot and another machinist on the
steamer

And where is Yakov asked the boy

I discharged him I ordered him away

For that queried Foma

Yes for that very thing

And Petrovich too

Yes I sent him the same way

Foma was pleased with the fact that his father was able to change the
men so quickly He smiled to his father and coming out on the deck
walked up to a sailor who sat on the floor untwisting a piece of rope
and making a swab

We have a new pilot here announced Foma

I know Good health to you Foma Ignatich How did you sleep

And a new machinist too

And a new machinist Are you sorry for Petrovich

Really And he was so good to you

Well why did he abuse my father

Oh Did he abuse him

Of course he did I heard it myself

Mmand your father heard it too

No I told him

Yousodrawled the sailor and became silent taking up his work
again

And papa says to me You he says you are master hereyou can
drive them all away if you wish

So said the sailor gloomily looking at the boy who was so
enthusiastically boasting to him of his supreme power From that day
on Foma noticed that the crew did not regard him as before Some became
more obliging and kind others did not care to speak to him and
when they did speak to him it was done angrily and not at all
entertainingly as before Foma liked to watch while the deck was being
washed their trousers rolled up to their knees or sometimes taken off
altogether the sailors with swabs and brushes in their hands cleverly
ran about the deck emptying pails of water on it besprinkling one
another laughing shouting falling Streams of water ran in every
direction and the lively noise of the men intermingled with the gray
splash of the water Before the boy never bothered the sailors in this
playful and light work nay he took an active part besprinkling them
with water and laughingly running away when they threatened to pour
water over him But after Yakov and Petrovich had been discharged he
felt that he was in everybodys way that no one cared to play with him
and that no one regarded him kindly Surprised and melancholy he left
the deck walked up to the wheel sat down there and offended he
thoughtfully began to stare at the distant green bank and the dented
strip of woods upon it And below on the deck the water was splashing
playfully and the sailors were gaily laughing He yearned to go down to
them but something held him back

Keep away from them as much as possible he recalled his fathers
words you are their master Then he felt like shouting at the
sailorssomething harsh and authoritative so his father would scold
them He thought a long time what to say but could not think of
anything Another two three days passed and it became perfectly clear
to him that the crew no longer liked him He began to feel lonesome on
the steamer and amid the particoloured mist of new impressions still
more often there came up before Foma the image of his kind and gentle
Aunt Anfisa with her stories and smiles and soft ringing laughter
which filled the boys soul with a joyous warmth He still lived in the
world of fairytales but the invisible and pitiless hand of reality
was already at work tearing the beautiful fine web of the wonderful
through which the boy had looked at everything about him The incident
with the machinist and the pilot directed his attention to his
surroundings Fomas eyes became more sharpsighted A conscious
searchfulness appeared in them and in his questions to his father rang a
yearning to understand which threads and springs were managing the deeds
of men

One day a scene took place before him the sailors were carrying wood
and one of them the young curlyhaired and gay Yefim passing the deck
of the ship with handbarrows said loudly and angrily

No he has no conscience whatever There was no agreement that I should
carry wood A sailorwell ones business is clearbut to carry wood
into the bargainthank you That means for me to take off the skin I
have not sold He is without conscience He thinks it is clever to sap
the life out of us

The boy heard this grumbling and knew that it was concerning his father
He also noticed that although Yefim was grumbling he carried more wood
on his stretcher than the others and walked faster than the others
None of the sailors replied to Yefims grumbling and even the one who
worked with him was silent only now and then protesting against the
earnestness with which Yefim piled up the wood on the stretchers

Enough he would say morosely you are not loading a horse are
you

And you had better keep quiet You were put to the cartcart it and
dont kickand should your blood be suckedkeep quiet again What can
you say

Suddenly Ignat appeared walked up to the sailor and stopping in front
of him asked sternly

What were you talking about

I am talkingI know replied Yefim hesitating There was no
agreementthat I must say nothing

And who is going to suck blood asked Ignat stroking his beard

The sailor understood that he had been caught unawares and seeing no
way out of it he let the log of wood fall from his hands rubbed his
palms against his pants and facing Ignat squarely said rather boldly

And am I not right Dont you suck it

I

You

Foma saw that his father swung his hand A loud blow resounded and the
sailor fell heavily on the wood He arose immediately and worked on in
silence Blood was trickling from his bruised face on to the white bark
of the birch wood he wiped the blood off his face with the sleeve of
his shirt looked at his sleeve and heaving a sigh maintained silence
and when he went past Foma with the handharrows two big turbid
tears were trembling on his face near the bridge of his nose and Foma
noticed them

At dinner Foma was pensive and now and then glanced at his father with
fear in his eyes

Why do you frown asked his father gently

Frown

Are you ill perhaps Be careful If there is anything tell me

You are strong said Foma of a sudden musingly

I Thats right God has favoured me with strength

How hard you struck him exclaimed the boy in a low voice lowering
his head

Ignat was about to put a piece of bread with caviar into his mouth
but his hand stopped held back by his sons exclamation he looked
interrogatively at Fomas drooping head and asked

You mean Yefim dont you

Yes he was bleeding And how he walked afterward how he cried said
the boy in a low voice

Mm roared Ignat chewing a bite Well are you sorry for him

Its a pity said Foma with tears in his voice

Yes So thats the kind of a fellow you are said Ignat

Then after a moments silence he filled a wineglass with vodka
emptied it and said sternly in a slightly reprimanding tone

There is no reason why you should pity him He brawled at random
and therefore got what he deserved I know him he is a good fellow
industrious strong and not a bit foolish But to argue is not his
business I may argue because I am the master It isnt simple to be
master A punch wouldnt kill him but will make him wiser Thats
the way Eh Foma You are an infant and you do not understand these
things I must teach you how to live It may be that my days on earth
are numbered

Ignat was silent for awhile drank some more vodka and went on
instinctively

It is necessary to have pity on men You are right in doing so But you
must pity them sensibly First look at a man find out what good there
is in him and what use may be made of him And if you find him to
be strong and capablepity and assist him And if he is weak and
not inclined to workspit upon him pass him by Just keep this in
mindthe man who complains against everything who sighs and moans all
the timethat man is worth nothing he merits no compassion and you
will do him no good whatever even if you help him Pity for such people
makes them more morose spoils them the more In your godfathers house
you saw various kinds of peopleunfortunate travellers and hangerson
and all sorts of rabble Forget them They are not men they are just
shells and are good for nothing They are like bugs fleas and other
unclean things Nor do they live for Gods sakethey have no God They
call His name in vain in order to move fools to pity and thus pitied
to fill their bellies with something They live but for their bellies
and aside from eating drinking sleeping and moaning they can do
nothing And all they accomplish is the souls decay They are in your
way and you trip over them A good man among themlike fresh apples
among bad onesmay soon be spoilt and no one will profit by it You
are young thats the trouble You cannot comprehend my words Help him
who is firm in misery He may not ask you for assistance but think of
it yourself and assist him without his request And if he should happen
to be proud and thus feel offended at your aid do not allow him to see
that you are lending him a helping hand Thats the way it should be
done according to common sense Here for example two boards let us
say fall into the mudone of them is a rotten one the other a good
sound board What should you do What good is there in the rotten board
You had better drop it let it stay in the mud and step on it so as not
to soil your feet As to the sound board lift it up and place it in the
sun if it can be of no use to you someone else may avail himself of
it Thats the way it is my son Listen to me and remember There is no
reason why Yefim should be pitied He is a capable fellow he knows his
value You cannot knock his soul out with a box on the ear Ill just
watch him for about a week and then Ill put him at the helm And
there I am quite sure hell be a good pilot And if he should be
promoted to captain he wouldnt lose couragehe would make a clever
captain Thats the way people grow I have gone through this school
myself dear I too received more than one box on the ear when I was
of his age Life my son is not a dear mother to all of us It is our
exacting mistress

Ignat talked with his son about two hours telling him of his own youth
of his toils of men their terrible power and of their weakness of
how they live and sometimes pretend to be unfortunate in order to live
on other peoples money and then he told him of himself and of how he
rose from a plain working man to be proprietor of a large concern The
boy listened to his words looked at him and felt as though his father
were coming nearer and nearer to him And though his fathers story
did not contain the material of which Aunt Anfisas fairytales were
brimful there was something new in it something clearer and
more comprehensible than in her fairytales and something just as
interesting Something powerful and warm began to throb within his
little heart and he was drawn toward his father Ignat evidently
surmised his sons feelings by his eyes he rose abruptly from his seat
seized him in his arms and pressed him firmly to his breast And Foma
embraced his neck and pressing his cheek to that of his father was
silent and breathed rapidly

My son whispered Ignat in a dull voice My darling My joy Learn
while I am alive Alas it is hard to live

The childs heart trembled at this whisper he set his teeth together
and hot tears gushed from his eyes

Until this day Ignat had never kindled any particular feeling in his
son the boy was used to him he was tired of looking at his enormous
figure and feared him slightly but was at the same time aware that his
father would do anything for him that he wanted Sometimes Ignat would
stay away from home a day two a week or possibly the entire summer
And yet Foma did not even notice his absence so absorbed was he by his
love for Aunt Anfisa When Ignat returned the boy was glad but he could
hardly tell whether it was his fathers arrival that gladdened him or
the playthings he brought with him But now at the sight of Ignat the
boy ran to meet him grasped him by the hand laughed stared into his
eyes and felt weary if he did not see him for two or three hours His
father became interesting to him and rousing his curiosity he fairly
developed love and respect for himself Every time that they were
together Foma begged his father

Papa tell me about yourself



The steamer was now going up the Volga One suffocating night in July
when the sky was overcast with thick black clouds and everything on the
Volga was somewhat ominously calm they reached Kazan and anchored near
Uslon at the end of an enormous fleet of vessels The clinking of the
anchor chains and the shouting of the crew awakened Foma he looked
out of the window and saw far in the distance small lights glimmering
fantastically the water about the boat black and thick like oiland
nothing else could be seen The boys heart trembled painfully and he
began to listen attentively A scarcely audible melancholy song reached
his earsmournful and monotonous as a chant on the caravan the watchmen
called to one another the steamer hissed angrily getting up steam
And the black water of the river splashed sadly and quietly against the
sides of the vessels Staring fixedly into the darkness until his eyes
hurt the boy discerned black piles and small lights dimly burning high
above them He knew that those were barges but this knowledge did
not calm him and his heart throbbed unevenly and in his imagination
terrifying dark images arose

Ooo a drawling cry came from the distance and ended like a wail

Someone crossed the deck and went up to the side of the steamer

Ooo was heard again but nearer this time

Yefim some one called in a low voice on the deck Yefimka

Well

Devil Get up Take the boathook

Ooo someone moaned near by and Foma shuddering stepped back from
the window

The queer sound came nearer and nearer and grew in strength sobbed and
died out in the darkness While on the deck they whispered with alarm

Yefimka Get up A guest is floating

Where came a hasty question then bare feet began to patter about the
deck a bustle was heard and two boathooks slipped down past the boys
face and almost noiselessly plunged into the water

A gueeest Some began to sob near by and a quiet but very queer
splash resounded

The boy trembled with fright at this mournful cry but he could not tear
his hands from the window nor his eyes from the water

Light the lantern You cant see anything

Directly

And then a spot of dim light fell over the water Foma saw that the
water was rocking calmly that a ripple was passing over it as though
the water were afflicted and trembled for pain

Look Look they whispered on the deck with fright

At the same time a big terrible human face with white teeth set
together appeared on the spot of light It floated and rocked in the
water its teeth seemed to stare at Foma as though saying with a smile

Eh boy boy it is cold Goodbye

The boathooks shook were lifted in the air were lowered again into
the water and carefully began to push something there

Shove him Shove Look out he may be thrown under the wheel

Shove him yourself then

The boathooks glided over the side of the steamer and scratching
against it produced a noise like the grinding of teeth Foma could
not close his eyes for watching them The noise of feet stamping on the
deck over his head was gradually moving toward the stern And then
again that moaning cry for the dead was heard

A gueeest

Papa cried Foma in a ringing voice Papa His father jumped to his
feet and rushed toward him

What is that What are they doing there cried Foma

Wildly roaring Ignat jumped out of the cabin with huge bounds He soon
returned sooner than Foma staggering and looking around him had time
to reach his fathers bed

They frightened you Its nothing said Ignat taking him up in his
arms Lie down with me

What is it asked Foma quietly

It was nothing my son Only a drowned man A man was drowned and he is
floating Thats nothing Dont be afraid he has already floated clear
of us

Why did they push him interrogated the boy firmly pressing close to
his father and shutting his eyes for fright

It was necessary to do so The water might have thrown him under the
wheel Under ours for instance Tomorrow the police would notice
it there would be trouble inquests and we would be held here for
examination Thats why we shoved him along What difference does it
make to him He is dead it doesnt pain him it doesnt offend him And
the living would be troubled on his account Sleep my son

So he will float on that way

He will float Theyll take him out somewhere and bury him

And will a fish devour him

Fish do not eat human bodies Crabs eat them They like them

Fomas fright was melting from the heat of his fathers body but
before his eyes the terrible sneering face was still rocking in the
black water

And who is he

God knows Say to God about him Oh Lord rest his soul 

Lord rest his soul repeated Foma in a whisper

Thats right Sleep now dont fear He is far away now Floating on
See here be careful as you go up to the side of the ship You may fall
overboard God forbid And

Did he fall overboard

Of course Perhaps he was drunk and thats his end And maybe he threw
himself into the water There are people who do that They go and throw
themselves into the water and are drowned Life my dear is so arranged
that death is sometimes a holiday for one sometimes it is a blessing
for all

Papa

Sleep sleep dear



CHAPTER III

DURING the very first day of his school life stupefied by the lively
and hearty noise of provoking mischiefs and of wild childish games
Foma picked out two boys from the crowd who at once seemed more
interesting to him than the others One had a seat in front of him
Foma looking askance saw a broad back a full neck covered with
freckles big ears and the back of the head closely cropped covered
with lightred hair which stood out like bristles

When the teacher a baldheaded man whose lower lip hung down called
out Smolin African the redheaded boy arose slowly walked up to
the teacher calmly stared into his face and having listened to the
problem carefully began to make big round figures on the blackboard
with chalk

Good enough said the teacher Yozhov Nicolai Proceed

One of Fomas neighbours a fidgety little boy with black little
mouseeyes jumped up from his seat and passed through the aisle
striking against everything and turning his head on all sides At the
blackboard he seized the chalk and standing up on the toes of his
boots noisily began to mark the board with the chalk creaking and
filling with chalk dust dashing off small illegible marks

Not so loud said the teacher wrinkling his yellow face and
contracting his fatigued eyes Yozhov spoke quickly and in a ringing
voice

Now we know that the first peddler made 17k profit

Enough Gordyeeff Tell me what must we do in order to find out how
much the second peddler gained

Watching the conduct of the boys so unlike each other Foma was thus
taken unawares by the question and he kept quiet

Dont you know How Explain it to him Smolin

Having carefully wiped his fingers which had been soiled with chalk
Smolin put the rag away and without looking at Foma finished the
problem and again began to wipe his hands while Yozhov smiling and
skipping along as he walked returned to his seat

Eh you he whispered seating himself beside Foma incidentally
striking his side with his fist Why dont you know it What was the
profit altogether Thirty kopecks And there were two peddlers One of
them got 17 Well how much did the other one get

I know replied Foma in a whisper feeling confused and examining the
face of Smolin who was sedately returning to his seat He didnt like
that round freckled face with the blue eyes which were loaded with
fat And Yozhov pinched his leg and asked

Whose son are you The Frantics

Yes

So Do you wish me to prompt you always

Yes

And what will you give me for it

Foma thought awhile and asked

And do you know it all yourself

I I am the best pupil Youll see for yourself

Hey there Yozhov you are talking again cried the teacher faintly

Yozhov jumped to his feet and said boldly

Its not I Ivan Andreyichits Gordyeeff

Both of them were whispering announced Smolin serenely

Wrinkling his face mournfully and moving his big lip comically the
teacher reprimanded them all but his words did not prevent Yozhov from
whispering immediately

Very well Smolin Ill remember you for telling

Well why do you blame it all on the new boy asked Smolin in a low
voice without even turning his head to them

All right all right hissed Yozhov

Foma was silent looking askance at his brisk neighbour who at once
pleased him and roused in him a desire to get as far as possible away
from him During recess he learned from Yozhov that Smolin too was
rich being the son of a tanyard proprietor and that Yozhov himself
was the son of a guard at the Court of Exchequer and very poor The
last was clearly evident by the adroit boys costume made of gray
fustian and adorned with patches on the knees and elbows by his pale
hungrylooking face and by his small angular and bony figure This
boy spoke in a metallic alto elucidating his words with grimaces and
gesticulations and he often used words whose meaning was known but to
himself

Well be friends he announced to Foma

Why did you complain to the teacher about me Gordyeeff reminded
Yozhov looking at him suspiciously

There Whats the difference to you You are a new scholar and rich
The teacher is not exacting with the rich And I am a poor hangeron he
doesnt like me because I am impudent and because I never bring him any
presents If I had been a bad pupil he would have expelled me long ago
You know Ill go to the Gymnasium from here Ill pass the second class
and then Ill leave Already a student is preparing me for the second
class There Ill study so that they cant hold me back How many horses
do you have

Three What do you need to study so much for asked Foma

Because I am poor The poor must study hard so that they may become
rich They become doctors functionaries officers I shall be a
tinkler A sword at my side spur on my boots Cling cling And what
are you going to be

I dont know said Foma pensively examining his companion

You need not be anything And are you fond of pigeons

Yes

What a goodfornothing you are Oh Eh Yozhov imitated Fomas slow
way of speaking How many pigeons do you have

I have none

Eh you Rich and yet you have no pigeons Even I have three If my
father had been rich I would have had a hundred pigeons and chased them
all day long Smolin has pigeons too fine ones Fourteen He made me
a present of one Only he is greedy All the rich are greedy And you
are you greedy too

I dont know said Foma irresolutely

Come up to Smolins and the three of us together will chase the
pigeons

Very well If they let me

Why does not your father like you

He does like me

Well then hell let you go Only dont tell him that I am coming
Perhaps he would not let you go with me Tell him you want to go to
Smolins Smolin

A plump boy came up to them and Yozhov accosted him shaking his head
reproachfully

Eh you redheaded slanderer It isnt worth while to be friends with
you blockhead

Why do you abuse me asked Smolin calmly examining Foma fixedly

I am not abusing you I am telling the truth Yozhov explained
straightening himself with animation Listen Although you are a
kissel butlet it go Well come up to see you on Sunday after mass

Come Smolin nodded his head

Well come up Theyll ring the bell soon I must run to sell the
siskin declared Yozhov pulling out of his pocket a paper package
wherein some live thing was struggling And he disappeared from the
schoolyard as mercury from the palm of a hand

What a queer fellow he is said Foma dumfounded by Yozhovs
adroitness and looking at Smolin interrogatively

He is always like this Hes very clever the redheaded boy
explained

And cheerful too added Foma

Cheerful too Smolin assented Then they became silent looking at
each other

Will you come up with him to my house asked the redheaded boy

Yes

Come up Its nice there

Foma said nothing to this Then Smolin asked him

Have you many friends

I have none

Neither did I have any friends before I went to school Only cousins
Now youll have two friends at once

Yes said Foma

Are you glad

Im glad

When you have lots of friends it is lively And it is easier to study
toothey prompt you

And are you a good pupil

Of course I do everything well said Smolin calmly

The bell began to bang as though it had been frightened and was hastily
running somewhere

Sitting in school Foma began to feel somewhat freer and compared his
friends with the rest of the boys He soon learned that they both were
the very best boys in school and that they were the first to attract
everybodys attention even as the two figures 5 and 7 which had not
yet been wiped off the blackboard And Foma felt very much pleased that
his friends were better than any of the other boys

They all went home from school together but Yozhov soon turned into
some narrow side street while Smolin walked with Foma up to his very
house and departing said

You see we both go home the same way too

At home Foma was met with pomp his father made him a present of a heavy
silver spoon with an ingenious monogram on it and his aunt gave him
a scarf knitted by herself They were awaiting him for dinner having
prepared his favourite dishes for him and as soon as he took off his
coat seated him at the table and began to ply him with questions

Well how was it How did you like the school asked Ignat looking
lovingly at his sons rosy animated face

Pretty good Its nice replied Foma

My darling sighed his aunt with feeling look out hold your own
with your friends As soon as they offend you tell your teachers about
it

Go on What else will you tell him Ignat smiled Never do that Try
to get square with every offender yourself punish him with your own
hand not with somebody elses Are there any good fellows there

There are two Foma smiled recalling Yozhov One of them is so
boldterrible

Whose is he

A guards son

Mm Bold did you say

Dreadfully bold

Well let him be And the other

The other one is redheaded Smolin

Ah Evidently Mitry Ivanovitchs son Stick to him hes good company
Mitry is a clever peasant If the son takes after his father it is all
right But that other oneyou know Foma you had better invite them
to our house on Sunday Ill buy some presents and you can treat them
Well see what sort of boys they are

Smolin asked me to come to him this Sunday said Foma looking up at
his father questioningly

So Well you may go Thats all right go Observe what kind of
people there are in the world You cannot pass your life alone without
friendship Your godfather and I for instance have been friends for
more than twenty years and I have profited a great deal by his common
sense So you too try to be friendly with those that are better and
wiser than you Rub against a good man like a copper coin against
silver and you may then pass for a silver coin yourself

And bursting into laughter at his comparison Ignat added seriously

I was only jesting Try to be not artificial but genuine And have
some common sense no matter how little but your own Have you many
lessons to do

Many sighed the boy and to his sigh like an echo his aunt answered
with a heavy sigh

Well study Dont be worse than others at school Although Ill tell
you even if there were twentyfive classes in your school they could
never teach you there anything save reading writing and arithmetic You
may also learn some naughty things but God protect you I shall give
you a terrible spanking if you do If you smoke tobacco Ill cut your
lips off

Remember God Fomushka said the aunt See that you dont forget our
Lord

Thats true Honour God and your father But I wish to tell you that
school books are but a trivial matter You need these as a carpenter
needs an adze and a pointer They are tools but the tools cannot teach
you how to make use of them Understand Let us see Suppose an adze
were handed to a carpenter for him to square a beam with it Its not
enough to have hands and an adze it is also necessary for him to know
how to strike the wood so as not to hit his foot instead To you the
knowledge of reading and writing is given and you must regulate your
life with it Thus it follows that books alone are but a trifle in this
matter it is necessary to be able to take advantage of them And it is
this ability that is more cunning than any books and yet nothing about
it is written in the books This Foma you must learn from Life itself
A book is a dead thing you may take it as you please you may tear it
break itit will not cry out While should you but make a single wrong
step in life or wrongly occupy a place in it Life will start to bawl
at you in a thousand voices it will deal you a blow felling you to the
ground

Foma his elbows leaning on the table attentively listened to his
father and under the sound of his powerful voice he pictured to himself
now the carpenter squaring a beam now himself his hands outstretched
carefully and stealthily approaching some colossal and living thing and
desiring to grasp that terrible something

A man must preserve himself for his work and must be thoroughly
acquainted with the road to it A man dear is like the pilot on a
ship In youth as at high tide go straight A way is open to you
everywhere But you must know when it is time to steer The waters
recedehere you see a sandbank there a rock it is necessary to know
all this and to slip off in time in order to reach the harbour safe and
sound

I will reach it said the boy looking at his father proudly and with
confidence

Eh You speak courageously Ignat burst into laughter And the aunt
also began to laugh kindly

Since his trip with his father on the Volga Foma became more lively and
talkative at home with his father with his aunt and with Mayakin But
on the street in a new place or in the presence of strangers he was
always gloomy always looking about him with suspicion as though he
felt something hostile to him everywhere something hidden from him
spying on him

At nights he sometimes awoke of a sudden and listened for a long time
to the silence about him fixedly staring into the dark with wideopen
eyes And then his fathers stories were transformed before him into
images and pictures Without being aware of it he mixed up those
stories with his aunts fairytales thus creating for himself a chaos
of adventures wherein the bright colours of fantasy were whimsically
intertwined with the stern shades of reality This resulted in something
colossal incomprehensible the boy closed his eyes and drove it all
away from him and tried to check the play of his imagination which
frightened him In vain he attempted to fall asleep and the chamber
became more and more crowded with dark images Then he quietly roused
his aunt

Auntie Auntie

What Christ be with you

Ill come to you whispered Foma

Why Sleep darling sleep

I am afraid confessed the boy

You better say to yourself And the Lord will rise again then you
wont be afraid

Foma lies with his eyes open and says the prayer The silence of the
night pictures itself before him in the form of an endless expanse
of perfectly calm dark water which has overflowed everything and
congealed there is not a ripple on it not a shadow of a motion and
neither is there anything within it although it is bottomlessly deep
It is very terrible for one to look down from the dark at this dead
water But now the sound of the night watchmans mallet is heard and
the boy sees that the surface of the water is beginning to tremble and
covering the surface with ripples light little balls are dancing upon
it The sound of the bell on the steeple with one mighty swing brings
all the water in agitation and it is slightly trembling from that sound
a big spot of light is also trembling spreading light upon the water
radiating from its centre into the dark distance there growing paler
and dying out Again there is weary and deathlike repose in this dark
desert

Auntie whispers Foma beseechingly

Dearest

I am coming to you

Come then come my darling

Going over into aunties bed he presses close to her begging

Tell me something

At night protests auntie sleepily

Please

He does not have to ask her long Yawning her eyes closed the old
woman begins slowly in a voice grown heavy with sleep

Well my dear sir in a certain kingdom in a certain empire there
lived a man and his wife and they were very poor They were so
unfortunate that they had nothing to eat They would go around begging
somebody would give them a crust of stale bread and that would keep them
for awhile And it came to pass that the wife begot a childa child was
bornit was necessary to christen it but being poor they could not
entertain the godparents and the guests so nobody came to christen the
child They tried this and they tried thatyet nobody came And they
began to pray to the Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord

Foma knew this awful story about Gods godchild He had heard it more
than once and was already picturing to himself this godchild riding on
a white horse to his godfather and godmother he was riding in the
darkness over the desert and he saw there all the unbearable miseries
to which sinners are condemned And he heard their faint moans and
requests

Oh Man Ask the Lord yet how long are we to suffer here

Then it appeared to Foma that it was he who was riding at night on the
white horse and that the moans and the implorings were addressed to
him His heart contracts with some incomprehensible desire sorrow
compressed his breast and tears gathered in his eyes which he had
firmly closed and now feared to open

He is tossing about in his bed restlessly

Sleep my child Christ be with you says the old woman interrupting
her tale of men suffering for their sins

But in the morning after such a night Foma rose sound and cheerful
washed himself hastily drank his tea in haste and ran off to school
provided with sweet cakes which were awaited by the always hungry
little Yozhov who greedily subsisted on his rich friends generosity

Got anything to eat he accosted Foma turning up his sharppointed
nose Let me have it for I left the house without eating anything I
slept too long devil take it I studied up to two oclock last night
Have you solved your problems

No I havent

Eh you lazy bones Well Ill dash them off for you directly

Driving his small thin teeth into the cakes he purred something like a
kitten stamped his left foot beating time and at the same time solved
the problem rattling off short phrases to Foma

See Eight bucketfuls leaked out in one hour And how many hours did it
leaksix Eh what good things they eat in your house Consequently we
must multiply six by eight Do you like cake with green onions Oh how
I like it So that in six hours fortyeight bucketfuls leaked out of
the first gaugecock And altogether the tub contained ninety Do you
understand the rest

Foma liked Yozhov better than Smolin but he was more friendly with
Smolin He wondered at the ability and the sprightliness of the little
fellow He saw that Yozhov was more clever and better than himself he
envied him and felt offended on that account and at the same time he
pitied him with the condescending compassion of a satisfied man for a
hungry one Perhaps it was this very compassion that prevented him from
preferring this bright boy to the boring redheaded Smolin Yozhov
fond of having a laugh at the expense of his wellfed friends told them
quite often Eh you are little trunks full of cakes

Foma was angry with him for his sneers and one day touched to the
quick said wickedly and with contempt

And you are a beggara pauper

Yozhovs yellow face became overcast and he replied slowly

Very well so be it I shall never prompt you againand youll be like
a log of wood

And they did not speak to each other for about three days very much to
the regret of the teacher who during these days had to give the lowest
markings to the son of the esteemed Ignat Matveyich

Yozhov knew everything he related at school how the procurators
chambermaid gave birth to a child and that for this the procurators
wife poured hot coffee over her husband he could tell where and when it
was best to catch perch he knew how to make traps and cages for birds
he could give a detailed account of how the soldier had hanged himself
in the garret of the armoury and knew from which of the pupils parents
the teacher had received a present that day and precisely what sort of a
present it was

The sphere of Smolins knowledge and interests was confined to the
merchants mode of life and above all the redheaded boy was fond of
judging whether this man was richer than that valuing and pricing their
houses their vessels and their horses All this he knew to perfection
and spoke of it with enthusiasm

Like Foma he regarded Yozhov with the same condescending pity but more
as a friend and equal Whenever Gordyeeff quarrelled with Yozhov Smolin
hastened to reconcile them and he said to Foma one day on their way
home

Why do you always quarrel with Yozhov

Well why is he so selfconceited said Foma angrily

He is proud because you never know your lessons and he always helps
you out He is clever And because he is pooris he to blame for that
He can learn anything he wants to and he will be rich too

He is like a mosquito said Foma disdainfully he will buzz and
buzz and then of a sudden will bite

But there was something in the life of these boys that united them all
there were hours when the consciousness of difference in their natures
and positions was entirely lost On Sundays they all gathered at
Smolins and getting up on the roof of the wing where they had an
enormous pigeonhouse they let the pigeons loose

The beautiful wellfed birds ruffling their snowwhite wings darted
out of the pigeonhouse one by one and seating themselves in a row
on the ridge of the roof and illumined by the sun cooing flaunted
before the boys

Scare them implored Yozhov trembling for impatience

Smolin swung a pole with a bastwisp fastened to its end and whistled

The frightened pigeons rushed into the air filling it with the hurried
flapping of their wings And now outlining big circles they easily
soar upwards into the blue depths of the sky they float higher and
higher their silver and snowwhite feathers flashing Some of them are
striving to reach the dome of the skies with the light soaring of the
falcon their wings outstretched wide and almost motionless others
play turn over in the air now dropping downward in a snowy lump now
darting up like an arrow Now the entire flock seems as though hanging
motionless in the desert of the sky and growing smaller and smaller
seems to sink in it With heads thrown back the boys admire the birds
in silence without taking their eyes from themtheir tired eyes so
radiant with calm joy not altogether free from envying these winged
creatures which so freely took flight from earth up into the pure
and calm atmosphere full of the glitter of the sun The small group of
scarcely visible dots now mere specks in the azure of the sky leads
on the imagination of the children and Yozhov expresses their common
feeling when in a low voice he says thoughtfully

Thats the way we ought to fly friends

While Foma knowing that human souls soaring heavenward oftentimes
assume the form of pigeons felt in his breast the rising of a burning
powerful desire

Unified by their joy attentively and mutely awaiting the return of
their birds from the depths of the sky the boys pressing close to one
another drifted far away from the breath of life even as their pigeons
were far from earth at this moment they are merely children knowing
neither envy nor anger free from everything they are near to one
another they are mute judging their feelings by the light in their
eyesand they feel as happy as the birds in the sky

But now the pigeons come down on the roof again and tired out by their
flight are easily driven into the pigeonhouse

Friends lets go for apples suggests Yozhov the instigator of all
games and adventures

His call drives out of the childrens souls the peacefulness brought
into them by the pigeons and then like plunderers carefully listening
for each and every sound they steal quietly across the back yards
toward the neighbouring garden The fear of being caught is balanced by
the hope of stealing with impunity But stealing is work and dangerous
work at that and everything that is earned by your own labour is so
sweet And the more effort required to gain it the sweeter it is
Carefully the boys climb over the fence of the garden and bending
down crawl toward the apple trees and full of fright look around
vigilantly Their hearts tremble and their throbbing slackens at the
faintest rustle They are alike afraid of being caught and if noticed
of being recognised but in case they should only see them and yell
at them they would be satisfied They would separate each going in a
different direction and then meeting again their eyes aglow with joy
and boldness would laughingly tell one another how they felt when they
heard some one giving chase to them and what happened to them when they
ran so quickly through the garden as though the ground were burning
under their feet

Such invasions were more to Fomas liking than all other adventures
and games and his behaviour during these invasions was marked with
a boldness that at once astounded and angered his companions He was
intentionally careless in other peoples gardens he spoke loud noisily
broke the branches of apple trees and tearing off a wormeaten apple
threw it in the direction of the proprietors house The danger of being
caught in the act did not frighten him it rather encouraged himhis
eyes would turn darker his teeth would clench and his face would
assume an expression of anger and pride

Smolin distorting his big mouth contemptibly would say to him

You are making entirely too much fuss about yourself

I am not a coward anyway replied Foma

I know that you are not a coward but why do you boast of it One may
do a thing as well without boasting

Yozhov blamed him from a different point of view

If you thrust yourself into their hands willingly you can go to the
devil I am not your friend Theyll catch you and bring you to your
fatherhe wouldnt do anything to you while I would get such a
spanking that all my bones would be skinned

Coward Foma persisted stubbornly

And it came to pass one day that Foma was caught by the second captain
Chumakov a thin little old man Noiselessly approaching the boy who
was hiding away in his bosom the stolen apples the old man seized him
by the shoulders and cried in a threatening voice

Now I have you little rogue Aha

Foma was then about fifteen years old and he cleverly slipped out of
the old mans hands Yet he did not run from him but knitting his brow
and clenching his fist he said threateningly

You dare to touch me

I wouldnt touch you Ill just turn you over to the police Whose son
are you

Foma did not expect this and all his boldness and spitefulness suddenly
left him

The trip to the police station seemed to him something which his father
would never forgive him He shuddered and said confusedly

Gordyeeff

Ignat Gordyeeffs

Yes

Now the second captain was taken aback He straightened himself
expanded his chest and for some reason or other cleared his throat
impressively Then his shoulders sank and he said to the boy in a
fatherly tone

Its a shame The son of such a wellknown and respected man It is
unbecoming your position You may go But should this happen again Hm
I should be compelled to notify your father to whom by the way I have
the honour of presenting my respects

Foma watched the play of the old mans physiognomy and understood that
he was afraid of his father Like a young wolf he looked askance at
Chumakov while the old man with comical seriousness twisted his
gray moustache hesitating before the boy who did not go away
notwithstanding the given permission

You may go repeated the old man pointing at the road leading to his
house

And how about the police asked Foma sternly and was immediately
frightened at the possible answer

I was but jesting smiled the old man I just wanted to frighten
you

You are afraid of my father yourself said Foma and turning his back
to the old man walked off into the depth of the garden

I am afraid Ah Very well exclaimed Chumakov after him and Foma
knew by the sound of his voice that he had offended the old man He felt
sad and ashamed he passed the afternoon in walking and coming home
he was met by his fathers stern question

Foma Did you go to Chumakovs garden

Yes I did said the boy calmly looking into his fathers eyes

Evidently Ignat did not expect such an answer and he was silent for
awhile stroking his beard

Fool Why did you do it Have you not enough of your own apples

Foma cast down his eyes and was silent standing before his father

See you are shamed Yozhishka must have incited you to this Ill
give it to him when he comes or Ill make an end of your friendship
altogether

I did it myself said Foma firmly

From bad to worse exclaimed Ignat But why did you do it

Because

Because mocked the father Well if you did it you ought to be
able to explain to yourself and to others the reason for so doing Come
here

Foma walked up to his father who was sitting on a chair and placed
himself between his knees Ignat put his hand on the boys shoulders
and smiling looked into his eyes

Are you ashamed

I am ashamed sighed Foma

There you have it fool You have disgraced me and yourself

Pressing his sons head to his breast he stroked his hair and asked
again

Why should you do such a thingstealing other peoples apples

II dont know said Foma confusedly Perhaps because it is so
lonesome I play and play the same thing day after day I am growing
tired of it While this is dangerous

Exciting asked the father smiling

Yes

Mm perhaps it is so But nevertheless Foma look outdrop this or
I shall deal with you severely

Ill never climb anywhere again said the boy with confidence

And that you take all the blame on yourselfthat is good What will
become of you in the future only God knows but meanwhileit is pretty
good It is not a trifle if a man is willing to pay for his deeds with
his own skin Someone else in your place would have blamed his friends
while you say I did it myself Thats the proper way Foma You
commit the sin but you also account for it Didnt Chumakov strike
you asked Ignat pausing as he spoke

I would have struck him back declared Foma calmly

Mm roared his father significantly

I told him that he was afraid of you That is why he complained
Otherwise he was not going to say anything to you about it

Is that so

By God Present my respects to your father he said

Did he

Yes

Ah the dog See what kind of people there are he is robbed and yet he
makes a bow and presents his respects Ha ha It is true it might have
been worth no more than a kopeck but a kopeck is to him what a rouble
is to me And it isnt the kopeck but since it is mine no one dares
touch it unless I throw it away myself Eh The devil take them Well
tell mewhere have you been what have you seen

The boy sat down beside his father and told him in detail all the
impressions of that day Ignat listened fixedly watching the animated
face of his son and the eyebrows of the big man contracted pensively

You are still but floating on the surface dear You are still but a
child Eh Eh

We scared an owl in the ravine related the boy That was fun It
began to fly about and struck against a treebang It even began to
squeak so pitifully And we scared it again again it rose and flew
about here and there and again it struck against something so that its
feathers were coming out It flew about in the ravine and at last hid
itself somewhere with difficulty We did not try to look for it we felt
sorry it was all bruised Papa is an owl entirely blind in daytime

Blind said Ignat some men will toss about in life even as this owl
in daytime Ever searching for his place he strives and strivesonly
feathers fly from him but all to no purpose He is bruised sickened
stripped of everything and then with all his might he thrusts himself
anywhere just to find repose from his restlessness Woe to such people
Woe to them dear

How painful is it to them said Foma in a low voice

Just as painful as to that owl

And why is it so

Why It is hard to tell Someone suffers because he is darkened by his
pridehe desires much but has but little strength Another because of
his foolishness But then there are a thousand and one other reasons
which you cannot understand

Come in and have some tea Anfisa called to them She had been
standing in the doorway for quite a long while and folding her hands
lovingly admired the enormous figure of her brother who bent over Foma
with such friendliness and the pensive pose of the boy who clung to
his fathers shoulder

Thus day by day Fomas life developed slowlya quiet peaceful life
not at all brimful of emotions Powerful impressions rousing the boys
soul for an hour or for a day sometimes stood out strikingly against
the general background of this monotonous life but these were soon
obliterated The boys soul was as yet but a calm lakea lake hidden
from the stormy winds of life and all that touched the surface of the
lake either sank to the bottom stirring the placid water for a moment
or gliding over the smooth surface swam apart in big circles and
disappeared

Having stayed at the district school for five years Foma passed four
classes tolerably well and came out a brave darkhaired fellow with
a swarthy face heavy eyebrows and dark down on the upper lip His
big dark eyes had a naive and pensive look and his lips were like a
childs halfopen but when meeting with opposition to his desires
or when irritated by something else the pupils of his eyes would grow
wide his lips press tight and his whole face assume a stubborn and
resolute expression His godfather smiling sceptically would often say
to him

To women Foma youll be sweeter than honey but as yet not much
common sense can be seen in you

Ignat would heave a sigh at these words

You had better start out your son as soon as possible

Theres time yet wait

Why wait Hell go about the Volga for two or three years and then
well have him married Theres my Lubov

Lubov Mayakina was now studying in the fifth class of some boarding
school Foma often met her on the street at which meeting she always
bowed condescendingly her fair head in a fashionable cap Foma liked
her but her rosy cheeks her cheerful brown eyes and crimson lips could
not smooth the impression of offence given to him by her condescending
bows She was acquainted with some Gymnasium students and although
Yozhov his old friend was among them Foma felt no inclination to be
with them and their company embarrassed him It seemed to him that
they were all boasting of their learning before him and that they were
mocking his ignorance Gathered together in Lubovs house they would
read some books and whenever he found them reading or loudly arguing
they became silent at his sight All this removed them further from him
One day when he was at Mayakins Luba called him to go for a walk in
the garden and there walking by his side asked him with a grimace on
her face

Why are you so unsociable You never talk about anything

What shall I talk about since I know nothing said Foma plainly

Studyread books

I dont feel like doing it

You see the Gymnasium students know everything and know how to talk
about everything Take Yozhov for instance

I know Yozhova chatterbox

You simply envy him He is very cleveryes He will soon graduate from
the Gymnasiumand then hell go to Moscow to study in the University

Well what of it said Foma indifferently

And youll remain just an ignorant man

Well be it so

That will be nice exclaimed Luba ironically

I shall hold my ground without science said Foma sarcastically And
Ill have a laugh at all the learned people Let the hungry study I
dont need it

Pshaw how stupid you are bad disgusting said the girl with
contempt and went away leaving him alone in the garden Offended and
gloomy he looked after her moved his eyebrows and lowering his head
slowly walked off into the depth of the garden

He already began to recognise the beauty of solitude and the sweet
poison of contemplation Oftentimes during summer evenings when
everything was coloured by the fiery tints of sunset kindling the
imagination an uneasy longing for something incomprehensible penetrated
his breast Sitting somewhere in a dark corner of the garden or lying
in bed he conjured up before him the images of the fairytale
princessesthey appeared with the face of Luba and of other young
ladies of his acquaintance noiselessly floating before him in the
twilight and staring into his eyes with enigmatic looks At times these
visions awakened in him a mighty energy as though intoxicating himhe
would rise and straightening his shoulders inhale the perfumed air
with a full chest but sometimes these same visions brought to him a
feeling of sadnesshe felt like crying but ashamed of shedding tears
he restrained himself and never wept in silence Or suddenly his heart
began to tremble with the desire to express his gratitude to God to
bow before Him the words of the prayer flashed through his memory and
beholding the sky he whispered them for a long time one by one and
his heart grew lighter breathing into prayer the excess of his power

The father patiently and carefully introduced him into commercial
circles took him on the Exchange told him about his contracts and
enterprises about his coassociates described to him how they had made
their way what fortunes they now possessed what natures were theirs
Foma soon mastered it regarding everything seriously and thoughtfully

Our bud is blooming into a bloodred cuprose Mayakin smiled winking
to Ignat

And yet even when Foma was nineteen years old there was something
childish in him something naive which distinguished him from the boys
of his age They were laughing at him considering him stupid he kept
away from them offended by their relations toward him As for his
father and Mayakin who were watching him vigilantly this uncertainty
of Fomas character inspired them with serious apprehensions

I cannot understand him Ignat would say with contrite heart He does
not lead a dissipated life he does not seem to run after the women
treats me and you with respect listens to everythinghe is more like a
pretty girl than a fellow And yet he does not seem to be stupid

No theres nothing particularly stupid about him said Mayakin

It looks as though he were waiting for somethingas though some kind
of shroud were covering his eyes His late mother groped on earth in the
same way

Just look theres Afrikanka Smolin but two years older than my
boywhat a man he has become That is it is difficult to tell whether
he is his fathers head or his father his He wants to go to some
factory to study He swears

Eh says he papa you have not taught me enough Yes While mine
does not express himself at all Oh Lord

Look here Mayakin advised him you had better push him head foremost
into some active business I assure you Gold is tested in fire Well
see what his inclinations are when at liberty Send him out on the
Kamaalone

To give him a trial

Well hell do some mischiefyoull lose somethingbut then well
know what stuff he is made of

IndeedIll send him off Ignat decided

And thus in the spring Ignat sent his son off on the Kama with two
barges laden with corn The barges were led by Gordyeeffs steamer
Philezhny under the command of Fomas old acquaintance the former
sailor Yefimnow Yefim Ilyich a squarely built man of about thirty
with lynxlike eyesa soberminded steady and very strict captain

They sailed fast and cheerfully because all were contented At first
Foma was proud of the responsible commission with which he had been
charged Yefim was pleased with the presence of the young master who
did not rebuke or abuse him for each and every oversight and the happy
frame of mind of the two most important persons on the steamer reflected
in straight rays on the entire crew Having left the place where they
had taken in their cargo of corn in April the steamer reached the place
of its destination in the beginning of May and the barges were anchored
near the shore with the steamer at their side Fomas duty was to
deliver the corn as soon as possible and receiving the payments start
off for Perm where a cargo of iron was awaiting him which Ignat had
undertaken to deliver at the market

The barges stood opposite a large village near a pine forest about two
versts distant from the shore On the very next day after their arrival
a big and noisy crowd of women and peasants on foot and on horses
came up to the shore early in the morning Shouting and singing they
scattered on the decks and in an instant work started expeditiously
Having descended into the holds the women were filling the sacks with
rye the peasants throwing the sacks upon their shoulders ran over the
gangplanks to the shore and from the shore carts heavily laden with
the longexpected corn went off slowly to the village The women sang
songs the peasants jested and gaily abused one another the sailors
representing the guardians of peace scolded the working people now and
then the gangplanks bending under the feet of the carriers splashed
against the water heavily while on the shore the horses neighed and
the carts and the sand under the wheels were creaking

The sun had just risen the air was fresh and invigorating and densely
filled with the odour of pines the calm water of the river reflecting
the clear sky was gently murmuring breaking against the sides of the
vessels and the chains of the anchors The loud and cheerful noise
of toil the youthful beauty of nature gaily illumined by the
sunbeamsall was full of a kindhearted somewhat crude sound power
which pleasantly stirred Fomas soul awakening in him new and perplexed
sensations and desires He was sitting by the table under the awning of
the steamer and drinking tea together with Yefim and the receiver of
the corn a provincial clerka redheaded shortsighted gentleman in
glasses Nervously shrugging his shoulders the receiver was telling in
a hoarse voice how the peasants were starving but Foma paid little
attention to his words looking now at the work below now at the other
side of the rivera tall yellow sandy steep shore whose edges were
covered with pine trees It was unpeopled and quiet

Ill have to go over there thought Foma And as though from a
distance the receivers tiresome unpleasant harsh voice fell on his
ears

You wouldnt believe itat last it became horrible Such an incident
took place A peasant came up to a certain intelligent man in Osa and
brought along with him a girl about sixteen years old

What do you wish

Here he says Ive brought my daughter to your Honour

What for

Perhaps he says youll take heryou are a bachelor

That is how What do you mean

I took her around town he says I wanted to hire her out as a
servantbut nobody would have hertake her at least as your mistress

Do you understand He offered his own daughterjust think of it A
daughteras a mistress The devil knows what that is Eh The man of
course became indignant and began abusing the peasant But the peasant
spoke to him reasonably

Your Honour Of what use is she to me at this time Utterly useless
I have says he three boysthey will be working men it is necessary
to keep them up Give me says he ten roubles for the girl and that
will improve my lot and that of my boys

How is that Eh It is simply terrible I tell you

No good sighed Yefim As they sayhunger will break through stone
walls The stomach you see has its own laws

This story called forth in Foma a great incomprehensible interest in the
fate of the girl and the youth hastened to enquire of the receiver

Well did the man buy her

Of course not exclaimed the receiver reproachfully

Well and what became of her

Some good people took pity on herand provided for her

Ah drawled Foma and suddenly he said firmly and angrily I would
have given that peasant such a thrashing I would have broken his head
And he showed the receiver his big tightlyclenched fist

Eh What for cried the receiver in a sickly loud voice tearing his
spectacles from his eyes You do not understand the motive

I do understand it said Foma with an obstinate shake of his head

But what could he do It came to his mind

How can one allow himself to sell a human being

Ah It is brutal I agree with you

And a girl at that I would have given him the ten roubles

The receiver waved his hand hopelessly and became silent His gesture
confused Foma He arose from his seat walked off to the railing
and looked down at the deck of the barge which was covered with an
industriously working crowd of people The noise intoxicated him and
the uneasy something which was rambling in his soul was now defined
into a powerful desire to work to have the strength of a giant to
possess enormous shoulders and put on them at one time a hundred bags of
rye that every one looking at him might be astonished

Come now hurry up there he shouted down in a ringing voice A few
heads were raised to him some faces appeared before him and one of
themthe face of a darkeyed womansmiled at him a gentle and enticing
smile Something flared up in his breast at this smile and began to
spread over his veins in a hot wave He drew back from the railing and
walked up to the table again feeling that his cheeks were burning

Listen said the receiver addressing him wire to your father asking
him to allow some grain for waste Just see how much is lost here And
here every pound is precious You should have understood this What a
fine father you have he concluded with a biting grimace

How much shall I allow asked Foma boldly and disdainfully Do
you want a hundred puds A pud is a weight of 40 Russian pounds Two
hundred

II thank you exclaimed the receiver overjoyed and confused if
you have the right to do it

I am the master said Foma firmly And you must not speak that way
about my fathernor make such faces

Pardon me II do not doubt that you have full power I thank you
heartily And your father tooin behalf of all these menin behalf of
the people

Yefim looked cautiously at the young master spreading out and smacking
his lips while the master with an air of pride on his face listened
to the quickwitted speech of the receiver who was pressing his hand
firmly

Two hundred puds That is Russianlike young man I shall directly
notify the peasants of your gift Youll see how grateful they will
behow glad And he shouted down

Eh boys The master is giving away two hundred puds

Three hundred interposed Foma

Three hundred puds Oh Thank you Three hundred puds of grain boys

But their response was weak The peasants lifted up their heads and
mutely lowered them again resuming their work A few voices said
irresolutely and as though unwillingly

Thanks May God give you We thank you very humbly

And some cried out gaily and disdainfully

Whats the use of that If they had given each of us a glass of vodka
insteadthat would be a just favour For the grain is not for usbut
for the country Council

Eh They do not understand exclaimed the receiver confused Ill go
down and explain it to them

And he disappeared But the peasants regard for his gift did not
interest Foma He saw that the black eyes of the rosycheeked woman were
looking at him so strangely and pleasingly They seemed to thank him
and caressingly beckoned him and besides those eyes he saw nothing The
woman was dressed like the city women She wore shoes a calico waist
and over her black hair she had a peculiar kerchief Tall and supple
seated on a pile of wood she repaired sacks quickly moving her hands
which were bare up to the elbows and she smiled at Foma all the time

Foma Ignatyich he heard Yefims reproachful voice youve showed off
too much Well if it were only about fifty puds But why so much Look
out that we dont get a good scolding for this

Leave me alone said Foma shortly

What is it to me Ill keep quiet But as you are so young and as I
was told to keep an eye on you I may get a rap on the snout for being
heedless

Ill tell my father all about it Keep quiet said Foma

As for melet it be soso that you are master here

Very well

I have said this Foma Ignatyich for your own sakebecause you are so
young and simpleminded

Leave me alone Yefim

Yefim heaved a sigh and became silent while Foma stared at the woman
and thought

I wish they would bring such a woman for sale to me

His heart beat rapidly Though as yet physically pure he already knew
from conversations the mysteries of intimate relations between men and
women He knew by rude and shameful names and these names kindled in
him an unpleasant burning curiosity and shame his imagination worked
obstinately for he could not picture it to himself in intelligible
images And in his soul he did not believe that those relations were
really so simple and rude as he had been told When they had laughed
at him and assured him that they were such and indeed could not be
otherwise he smiled stupidly and confusedly but thought nevertheless
that the relations with women did not have to be in such a shameful form
for everyone and that in all probability there was something purer
less rude and abusive to a human being

Now looking at the darkeyed working woman with admiration Foma
distinctly felt just that rude inclination toward her and he was
ashamed and afraid of something And Yefim standing beside him said
admonitively

There you are staring at the woman so that I cannot keep silence any
longer You do not know her but when she winks at you you may because
of your youthand with a nature like yoursyou may do such a thing
that well have to go home on foot by the shore And well have to thank
God if our trousers at least remain with us

What do you want asked Foma red with confusion

I want nothing And you had better mind me In regard to affairs with
women I may perfectly well be a teacher You must deal with a woman very
plainlygive her a bottle of vodka something to eat after it then a
couple of bottles of beer and after everything give her twenty kopecks
in cash For this price she will show you all her love in the best way
possible

You are lying said Foma softly

I am lying Why shall I lie to you since I have observed that same
policy perhaps a hundred times Just charge me to have dealings with
her Eh Ill make you acquainted with her in a moment

Very well said Foma feeling that he could hardly breathe and that
something was choking his throat

Well then Ill bring her up in the evening

And Yefim smiled approvingly into Fomas face and walked off Until
evening Foma walked about as though lost in mist not noticing the
respectful and beseeching glances with which the peasants greeted him
at the receivers instigation Dread fell on him he felt himself guilty
before somebody and to all those that addressed him he replied humbly
and gently as though excusing himself for something Some of the
working people went home toward evening others gathered on the shore
near a big bright bonfire and began cooking their supper Fragments of
their conversation floated about in the stillness of the evening The
reflection of the fire fell on the river in red and yellow stripes
which trembled on the calm water and on the window panes of the cabin
where Foma was sitting He sat in the corner on a lounge which was
covered with oilclothand waited On the table before him were a few
bottles of vodka and beer and plates with bread and dessert He
covered the windows and did not light the lamp the faint light from
the bonfire penetrating through the curtains fell on the table on
the bottles and on the wall and trembled now growing brighter now
fainter It was quiet on the steamer and on the barges only from
the shore came indistinct sounds of conversation and the river was
splashing scarcely audible against the sides of the steamer It seemed
to Foma that somebody was hiding in the dark near by listening to him
and spying upon him Now somebody is walking over the gangplank of the
barges with quick and heavy stepsthe gangplank strikes against the
water clangously and angrily Foma hears the muffled laughter of the
captain and his lowered voice Yefim stands by the cabin door and
speaks softly but somewhat reprimandingly as though instructing Foma
suddenly felt like crying out

It is not necessary

And he arose from the loungebut at this moment the cabin door was
opened the tall form of a woman appeared on the threshold and
noiselessly closing the door behind her she said in a low voice

Oh dear How dark it is Is there a living soul somewhere around here

Yes answered Foma softly

Well then good evening

And the woman moved forward carefully

Ill light the lamp said Foma in a broken voice and sinking on the
lounge he curled himself up in the corner

It is good enough this way When you get used to it you can see
everything in the dark as well

Be seated said Foma

I will

She sat down on the lounge about two steps away from him Foma saw the
glitter of her eyes he saw a smile on her full lips It seemed to
him that this smile of hers was not at all like that other smile
beforethis smile seemed plaintive sad This smile encouraged him
he breathed with less difficulty at the sight of these eyes which on
meeting his own suddenly glanced down on the floor But he did not know
what to say to this woman and for about two minutes both were silent It
was a heavy awkward silence She began to speak

You must be feeling lonesome here all alone

Yes answered Foma

And do you like our place here asked the woman in a low voice

It is nice There are many woods here

And again they became silent

The river if you like is more beautiful than the Volga uttered
Foma with an effort

I was on the Volga

Where

In the city of Simbirsk

Simbirsk repeated Foma like an echo feeling that he was again unable
to say a word

But she evidently understood with whom she had to deal and she suddenly
asked him in a bold whisper

Why dont you treat me to something

Here Foma gave a start Indeed how queer I am Well then come up
to the table

He bustled about in the dark pushed the table took up one bottle then
another and again returned them to their place laughing guiltily and
confusedly as he did so She came up close to him and stood by his side
and smiling looked at his face and at his trembling hands

Are you bashful she suddenly whispered

He felt her breath on his cheek and replied just as softly

Yes

Then she placed her hands on his shoulders and quietly drew him to her
breast saying in a soothing whisper

Never mind dont be bashful my young handsome darling How I pity
you

And he felt like crying because of her whisper his heart was melting
in sweet fatigue pressing his head close to her breast he clasped
her with his hands mumbling to her some inarticulate words which were
unknown to himself

Be gone said Foma in a heavy voice staring at the wall with his eyes
wide open

Having kissed him on the cheek she walked out of the cabin saying to
him

Well goodbye

Foma felt intolerably ashamed in her presence but no sooner did she
disappear behind the door than he jumped up and seated himself on the
lounge Then he arose staggering and at once he was seized with the
feeling of having lost something very valuable something whose presence
he did not seem to have noticed in himself until the moment it was lost
But immediately a new manly feeling of selfpride took possession of
him It drowned his shame and instead of the shame pity for the woman
sprang up within himfor the halfclad woman who went out alone into
the dark of the chilly May night He hastily came out on the deckit
was a starlit but moonless night the coolness and the darkness
embraced him On the shore the goldenred pile of coals was still
glimmering Foma listenedan oppressive stillness filled the air only
the water was murmuring breaking against the anchor chains There was
not a sound of footsteps to be heard Foma now longed to call the woman
but he did not know her name Eagerly inhaling the fresh air into his
broad chest he stood on deck for a few minutes Suddenly from beyond
the roundhousefrom the prowa moan reached his earsa deep loud
moan resembling a wail He shuddered and went thither carefully
understanding that she was there

She sat on the deck close to the side of the steamer and leaning her
head against a heap of ropes she wept Foma saw that her bare white
shoulders were trembling he heard her pitiful moans and began to feel
depressed Bending over her he asked her timidly

What is it

She nodded her head and said nothing in reply

Have I offended you

Go away she said

But how said Foma alarmed and confused touching her head with his
hand Dont be angry You came of your own free will

I am not angry she replied in a loud whisper Why should I be angry
at you You are not a seducer You are a pure soul Eh my darling Be
seated here by my side

And taking Foma by the hand she made him sit down like a child in
her lap pressed his head close to her breast and bending over him
pressed her lips to his for a long time

What are you crying about asked Foma caressing her cheek with one
hand while the other clasped the womans neck

I am crying about myself Why have you sent me away she asked
plaintively

I began to feel ashamed of myself said Foma lowering his head

My darling Tell me the truthhavent you been pleased with me she
asked with a smile but her big hot tears were still trickling down on
Fomas breast

Why should you speak like this exclaimed the youth almost
frightened and hotly began to mumble to her some words about her
beauty about her kindness telling her how sorry he was for her and
how bashful in her presence And she listened and kept on kissing his
cheeks his neck his head and his uncovered breast

He became silentthen she began to speaksoftly and mournfully as
though speaking of the dead

And I thought it was something else When you said Be gone I got
up and went away And your words made me feel sad very sad There was
a time I remembered when they caressed me and fondled me unceasingly
without growing tired for a single kind smile they used to do for me
anything I pleased I recalled all this and began to cry I felt sorry
for my youth for I am now thirty years old the last days for a woman
Eh Foma Ignatyevich she exclaimed lifting her voice louder and
reiterating the rhythm of her harmonious speech whose accents rose and
fell in unison with the melodious murmuring of the water

Listen to mepreserve your youth There is nothing in the world better
than that There is nothing more precious than youth With youth as
with gold you can accomplish anything you please Live so that you
shall have in old age something to remind you of your youth Here I
recalled myself and though I cried yet my heart blazed up at the very
recollection of my past life And again I was young as though I drank
of the water of life My sweet child Ill have a good time with you if
I please you well enjoy ourselves as much as we can Eh Ill burn to
ashes now that I have blazed up

And pressing the youth close to herself she greedily began to kiss him
on the lips

Loook ouuut the watch on the barge wailed mournfully and
cutting short the last syllable began to strike his mallet against the
castiron board

The shrill trembling sounds harshly broke the solemn quiet of the
night

A few days later when the barges had discharged their cargo and the
steamer was ready to leave for Perm Yefim noticed to his great sorrow
that a cart came up to the shore and that the darkeyed Pelageya with a
trunk and with some bundles was in it

Send a sailor to bring her things ordered Foma nodding his head
toward the shore

With a reproachful shake of his head Yefim carried out the order
angrily and then asked in a lowered voice

So she too is coming with us

She is going with me Foma announced shortly

It is understood Not with all of us Oh Lord

Why are you sighing

Yes Foma Ignatyich We are going to a big city Are there not plenty
of women of her kind

Well keep quiet said Foma sternly

I will keep quiet but this isnt right

What

This very wantonness of ours Our steamer is perfect cleanand
suddenly there is a woman there And if it were at least the right sort
of a woman But as it is she merely bears the name of woman

Foma frowned insinuatingly and addressed the captain imperiously
emphasizing his words

Yefim I want you to bear it in mind and to tell it to everybody here
that if anyone will utter an obscene word about her Ill strike him on
the head with a log of wood

How terrible said Yefim incredulously looking into the masters
face with curiosity But he immediately made a step backward Ignats
son like a wolf showed his teeth the apples of his eyes became wider
and he roared

Laugh Ill show you how to laugh

Though Yefim lost courage he nevertheless said with dignity

Although you Foma Ignatyich are the master yet as I was told
Watch Yefim and then I am the captain here

The captain cried Foma shuddering in every limb and turning pale
And who am I

Well dont bawl On account of such a trifle as a woman

Red spots came out on Fomas pale face he shifted from one foot to the
other thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket with a convulsive
motion and said in a firm and even voice

You Captain See here say another word against meand you go to
the devil Ill put you ashore Ill get along as well with the pilot
Understand You cannot command me Do you see

Yefim was dumfounded He looked at his master and comically winked his
eyes finding no reply to his words

Do you understand I say

Yes I understand drawled Yefim But what is all this noise about
On account of

Silence

Fomas eyes which flashed wildly and his face distorted with wrath
suggested to the captain the happy thought to leave his master as soon
as possible and turning around quickly he walked off

Pshaw How terrible As it seems the apple did not fall too far from
the tree he muttered sneeringly walking on the deck He was angry at
Foma and considered himself offended for nothing but at the same time
he began to feel over himself the real firm hand of a master For years
accustomed to being subordinate he rather liked this manifestation of
power over him and entering the cabin of the old pilot he related
to him the scene between himself and his master with a shade of
satisfaction in his voice

See he concluded his story A pup coming from a good breed is an
excellent dog at the very first chase From his exterior he is soso A
man of rather heavy mind as yet Well never mind let him have his
fun It seems now as though nothing wrong will come out of this With a
character like his no How he bawled at me A regular trumpet I tell
you And he appointed himself master at once As though he had sipped
power and strictness out of a ladle

Yefim spoke the truth during these few days Foma underwent a striking
transformation The passion now kindled in him made him master of the
soul and body of a woman he eagerly absorbed the fiery sweetness of
this power and this burned out all that was awkward in him all that
gave him the appearance of a somewhat stupid gloomy fellow and
destroying it filled his heart with youthful pride with the
consciousness of his human personality Love for a woman is always
fruitful to the man be the love whatever it may even though it were to
cause but sufferings there is always much that is rich in it Working
as a powerful poison on those whose souls are afflicted it is for the
healthy man as fire for iron which is to be transformed into steel

Fomas passion for the thirtyyearold woman who lamented in his
embraces her dead youth did not tear him away from his affairs he was
never lost in the caresses or in his affairs bringing into both his
whole self The woman like good wine provoked in him alike a thirst
for labour and for love and she too became younger from the kisses of
the youth

In Perm Foma found a letter waiting for him It was from his godfather
who notified him that Ignat out of anxiety for his son had begun to
drink heavily and that it was harmful to drink thus for a man of his
age The letter concluded with advice to hurry up matters in order
to return home the sooner Foma felt alarmed over this advice and it
clouded the clear holiday of his heart But this shadow soon melted in
his worries over his affairs and in the caresses of Pelageya His life
streamed on with the swiftness of a river wave and each day brought to
him new sensations awakening in him new thoughts Pelageyas relations
with him contained all the passion of a mistress all that power of
feeling which women of her age put into their passion when drinking the
last drops from the cup of life But at times a different feeling awoke
in her a feeling not less powerful and by which Foma became still more
attached to hersomething similar to a mothers yearning to guard her
beloved son from errors to teach him the wisdom of life Oftentimes at
night sitting in his embraces on the deck she spoke to him tenderly
and sadly

Mind me as an older sister of yours I have lived I know men I have
seen a great deal in my life Choose your companions with care for
there are people just as contagious as a disease At first you cannot
tell them even when you see them he looks to be a man like everybody
else and suddenly without being aware of it yourself you will start
to imitate him in life You look aroundand you find that you have
contracted his scabs I myself have lost everything on account of a
friend I had a husband and two children We lived well My husband was
a clerk at a volost She became silent and looked for a long time at
the water which was stirred by the vessel Then she heaved a sigh and
spoke to him again

May the Holy Virgin guard you from women of my kindbe careful You
are tender as yet your heart has not become properly hardened And
women are fond of such as youstrong handsome rich And most of all
beware of the quiet women They stick to a man like bloodsuckers and
suck and suck And at the same time they are always so kind so gentle
They will keep on sucking your juice but will preserve themselves
Theyll only break your heart in vain You had better have dealings with
those that are bold like myself These live not for the sake of gain

And she was indeed disinterested In Perm Foma purchased for her
different new things and whatnot She was delighted but later having
examined them she said sadly

Dont squander your money too freely See that your father does not get
angry I love you anyway without all this

She had already told him that she would go with him only as far as
Kazan where she had a married sister Foma could not believe that she
would leave him and when on the eve of their arrival at Kazan she
repeated her words he became gloomy and began to implore her not to
forsake him

Do not feel sorry in advance she said We have a whole night before
us You will have time to feel sorry when I bid you goodbye if you
will feel sorry at all

But he still tried to persuade her not to forsake him and
finallywhich was to be expectedannounced his desire to marry her

So so and she began to laugh Shall I marry you while my husband
is still alive My darling my queer fellow You have a desire to marry
eh But do they marry such women as I am You will have many many
mistresses Marry then when you have overflowed when you have had your
fill of all sweets and feel like having rye bread Then you may marry
I have noticed that a healthy man for his own peace must not marry
early One woman will not be enough to satisfy him and hell go to
other women And for your own happiness you should take a wife only
when you know that she alone will suffice for you

But the more she spoke the more persistent Foma became in his desire
not to part with her

Just listen to what Ill tell you said the woman calmly A splinter
of wood is burning in your hand and you can see well even without its
lightyou had better dip it into water so that there will be no smell
of smoke and your hand will not be burned

I do not understand your words

Do understand You have done me no wrong and I do not wish to do you
any And therefore I am going away

It is hard to say what might have been the result of this dispute if an
accident had not interfered with it In Kazan Foma received a telegram
from Mayakin who wrote to his godson briefly Come immediately on the
passenger steamer Fomas heart contracted nervously and a few hours
later gloomy and pale his teeth set together he stood on the deck
of the steamer which was leaving the harbour and clinging to the rail
with his hands he stared motionlessly into the face of his love who
was floating far away from him together with the harbour and the shore
Pelageya waved her handkerchief and smiled but he knew that she was
crying shedding many painful tears From her tears the entire front
of Fomas shirt was wet and from her tears his heart full of gloomy
alarm was sad and cold The figure of the woman was growing smaller
and smaller as though melting away and Foma without lifting his eyes
stared at her and felt that aside from fear for his father and sorrow
for the woman some new powerful and caustic sensation was awakening in
his soul He could not name it but it seemed to him as something like a
grudge against someone

The crowd in the harbour blended into a close dark and dead spot
faceless formless motionless Foma went away from the rail and began
to pace the deck gloomily

The passengers conversing aloud seated themselves to drink tea the
porters bustled about on the gallery setting the tables somewhere
below on the stern in the third class a child was crying a harmonica
was wailing the cook was chopping something with knives the dishes
were jarringproducing a rather harsh noise Cutting the waves and
making foam shuddering under the strain and sighing heavily the
enormous steamer moved rapidly against the current Foma looked at the
wide strip of broken struggling and enraged waves at the stern of the
steamer and began to feel a wild desire to break or tear something
also to go breast foremost against the current and to mass its
pressure against himself against his breast and his shoulders

Fate said someone beside him in a hoarse and weary voice

This word was familiar to him his Aunt Anfisa had often used it as
an answer to his questions and he had invested in this brief word a
conception of a power similar to the power of God He glanced at the
speakers one of them was a gray little old man with a kind face
the other was younger with big weary eyes and with a little black
wedgeshaped beard His big gristly nose and his yellow sunken cheeks
reminded Foma of his godfather

Fate The old man repeated the exclamation of his interlocutor with
confidence and began to smile Fate in life is like a fisherman on the
river it throws a baited hook toward us into the tumult of our life and
we dart at it with greedy mouths Then fate pulls up the rodand the
man is struggling flopping on the ground and then you see his heart is
broken Thats how it is my dear man

Foma closed his eyes as if a ray of the sun had fallen full on them
and shaking his head he said aloud

True That is true

The companions looked at him fixedly the old man with a fine wise
smile the largeeyed man unfriendly askance This confused Foma he
blushed and walked away thinking of Fate and wondering why it had first
treated him kindly by giving him a woman and then took back the gift
from him so simply and abusively And he now understood that the vague
caustic feeling which he carried within him was a grudge against Fate
for thus sporting with him He had been too much spoiled by life to
regard more plainly the first drop of poison from the cup which was
just started and he passed all the time of the journey without sleep
pondering over the old mans words and fondling his grudge This grudge
however did not awaken in him despondency and sorrow but rather a
feeling of anger and revenge

Foma was met by his godfather and to his hasty and agitated question
Mayakin his greenish little eyes flashing excitedly said when he
seated himself in the carriage beside his godson

Your father has grown childish

Drinking

Worsehe has lost his mind completely

Really Oh Lord Tell me

Dont you understand A certain lady is always around him

What about her exclaimed Foma recalling his Pelageya and for some
reason or other his heart was filled with joy

She sticks to him andbleeds him

Is she a quiet one

She Quiet as a fire Seventyfive thousand roubles she blew out of his
pocket like a feather

Oh Who is she

Sonka Medinskaya the architects wife

Great God Is it possible that sheDid my fatherIs it possible that
he took her as his sweetheart asked Foma with astonishment in a low
voice

His godfather drew back from him and comically opening his eyes wide
said convincedly

You are out of your mind too By God youre out of your mind Come to
your senses A sweetheart at the age of sixtythree And at such a price
as this What are you talking about Well Ill tell this to Ignat

And Mayakin filled the air with a jarring hasty laughter at which his
goatlike beard began to tremble in an uncomely manner It took Foma a
long time to obtain a categorical answer the old man contrary to his
habit was restless and irritated his speech usually fluent was now
interrupted he was swearing and expectorating as he spoke and it was
with difficulty that Foma learned what the matter was Sophya Pavlovna
Medinskaya the wealthy architects wife who was well known in the city
for her tireless efforts in the line of arranging various charitable
projects persuaded Ignat to endow seventyfive thousand roubles for the
erection of a lodginghouse in the city and of a public library with
a readingroom Ignat had given the money and already the newspapers
lauded him for his generosity Foma had seen the woman more than once
on the streets she was short he knew that she was considered as one of
the most beautiful women in the city and that bad rumours were afoot as
to her behaviour

Is that all exclaimed Foma when his godfather concluded the story
And I thought God knows what

You You thought cried Mayakin suddenly grown angry You thought
nothing you beardless youngster

Why do you abuse me Foma said

Tell me in your opinion is seventyfive thousand roubles a big sum or
not

Yes a big sum said Foma after a moments thought

Ah ha

But my father has much money Why do you make such a fuss about it

Yakov Tarasovich was taken aback He looked into the youths face with
contempt and asked him in a faint voice

And you speak like this

I Who then

You lie It is your young foolishness that speaks Yes And my old
foolishnessbrought to test a million times by lifesays that you are
a young dog as yet and it is too early for you to bark in a basso

Foma hearing this had often been quite provoked by his godfathers too
picturesque language

Mayakin always spoke to him more roughly than his father but now the
youth felt very much offended by the old man and said to him reservedly
but firmly

You had better not abuse me without reflection for I am no longer a
small child

Come come exclaimed Mayakin mockingly lifting his eyebrows and
squinting

This roused Fomas indignation He looked full into the old mans eyes
and articulated with emphasis

And I am telling you that I dont want to hear any more of that
undeserved abuse of yours Enough

Mm Soo Pardon me

Yakov Tarasovich closed his eyes chewed a little with his lips and
turning aside from his godson kept silent for awhile The carriage
turned into a narrow street and noticing from afar the roof of his
house Foma involuntarily moved forward At the same time Mayakin asked
him with a roguish and gentle smile

Foma Tell meon whom you have sharpened your teeth Eh

Why are they sharp asked Foma pleased with the manner in which
Mayakin now regarded him

Pretty good Thats good dear Thats very good Your father and I
were afraid lest you should be a laggard Well have you learned to
drink vodka

I drank it

Rather too soon Did you drink much of it

Why much

Does it taste good

Not very

So Never mind all this is not so bad Only you are too outspoken
You are ready to confess all your sins to each and every pope that comes
along You must consider it isnt always necessary to do that Sometimes
by keeping silent you both please people and commit no sins Yes A
mans tongue is very seldom sober Here we are See your father does
not know that you have arrived Is he home yet I wonder

He was at home his loud somewhat hoarse laughter was heard from the
open windows of the rooms The noise of the carriage which stopped at
the house caused Ignat to look out of the window and at the sight of
his son he cried out with joy

Ah Youve come

After a while he pressed Foma to his breast with one hand and pressing
the palm of his other hand against his sons forehead thus bending
his head back he looked into his face with beaming eyes and spoke
contentedly

You are sunburnt Youve grown strong Youre a fine fellow Madame
Hows my son Isnt he fine

Not bad looking a gentle silver voice was heard Foma glanced from
behind his fathers shoulder and noticed that a slender woman with
magnificent fair hair was sitting in the front corner of the room
resting her elbows on the table her dark eyes her thin eyebrows and
plump red lips strikingly defined on her pale face Behind her armchair
stood a large philodendronplant whose big figured leaves were hanging
down in the air over her little golden head

How do you do Sophya Pavlovna said Mayakin tenderly approaching
her with his hand outstretched What are you still collecting
contributions from poor people like us

Foma bowed to her mutely not hearing her answer to Mayakin nor what
his father was saying to him The lady stared at him steadfastly and
smiled to him affably and serenely Her childlike figure clothed in
some kind of dark fabric was almost blended with the crimson stuff
of the armchair while her wavy golden hair and her pale face shone
against the dark background Sitting there in the corner beneath the
green leaves she looked at once like a flower and like an ikon

See Sophya Pavlovna how he is staring at you An eagle eh said
Ignat

Her eyes became narrower a faint blush leaped to her cheeks and she
burst into laughter It sounded like the tinkling of a little silver
bell And she immediately arose saying

I wouldnt disturb you Goodbye

When she went past Foma noiselessly the scent of perfume came to him
and he noticed that her eyes were dark blue and her eyebrows almost
black

The sly rogue glided away said Mayakin in a low voice angrily
looking after her

Well tell us how was the trip Have you squandered much money roared
Ignat pushing his son into the same armchair where Medinskaya had been
sitting awhile before Foma looked at him askance and seated himself in
another chair

Isnt she a beautiful young woman eh said Mayakin smiling feeling
Foma with his cunning eyes If you keep on gaping at her she will eat
away all your insides

Foma shuddered for some reason or other and saying nothing in reply
began to tell his father about the journey in a matteroffact tone But
Ignat interrupted him

Wait Ill ask for some cognac

And you are keeping on drinking all the time they say said Foma
disapprovingly

Ignat glanced at his son with surprise and curiosity and asked

Is this the way to speak to your father

Foma became confused and lowered his head

Thats it said Ignat kindheartedly and ordered cognac to be
brought to him

Mayakin winking his eyes looked at the Gordyeeffs sighed bid them
goodbye and after inviting them to have tea with him in his raspberry
garden in the evening went away

Where is Aunt Anfisa asked Foma feeling that now being alone with
his father he was somewhat ill at ease

She went to the cloister Well tell me and I will have some cognac

Foma told his father all about his affairs in a few minutes and he
concluded his story with a frank confession

I have spent much money on myself

How much

About six hundred roubles

In six weeks Thats a good deal I see as a clerk youre too expensive
for me Where have you squandered it all

I gave away three hundred puds of grain

To whom How

Foma told him all about it

Hm Well thats all right Ignat approved Thats to show what stuff
we are made of Thats clear enoughfor the fathers honourfor the
honour of the firm And there is no loss either because that gives a
good reputation And that my dear is the very best signboard for a
business Well what else

And then I somehow spent more

Speak frankly Its not the money that I am asking you aboutI just
want to know how you lived there insisted Ignat regarding his son
attentively and sternly

I was eating drinking Foma did not give in bending his head
morosely and confusedly

Drinking vodka

Vodka too

Ah So Isnt it rather too soon

Ask Yefim whether I ever drank enough to be intoxicated

Why should I ask Yefim You must tell me everything yourself So you
are drinking I dont like it

But I can get along without drinking

Come come Do you want some cognac

Foma looked at his father and smiled broadly And his father answered
him with a kindly smile

Eh you Devil Drink but look outknow your business What can
you do A drunkard will sleep himself sober a foolnever Let us
understand this much at least for our own consolation And did you have
a good time with girls too Be frank Are you afraid that I will beat
you or what

Yes There was one on the steamer I had her there from Perm to Kazan

So Ignat sighed heavily and said frowning Youve become defiled
rather too soon

I am twenty years old And you yourself told me that in your days
fellows married at the age of fifteen replied Foma confused

Then they married Very well then let us drop the subject
Well youve had dealings with a woman What of it A woman is like
vaccination you cannot pass your life without her As for myself I
cannot play the hypocrite I began to go around with women when I was
younger than you are now But you must be on your guard with them

Ignat became pensive and was silent for a long time sitting motionless
his head bent low on his breast

Listen Foma he started again sternly and firmly I shall die
before long I am old Something oppresses my breast I breathe with
difficulty Ill die Then all my affairs will fall on your shoulders
At first your godfather will assist youmind him You started quite
well you attended to everything properly you held the reins firmly
in your hands And though you did squander a big sum of money it is
evident that you did not lose your head God grant the same in the
future You should know this business is a living strong beast you
must manage it ably you must put a strong bridle on it or it will
conquer you Try to stand above your business Place yourself so that it
will all be under your feet that each little tack shall be visible to
you

Foma looked at his fathers broad chest heard his heavy voice and
thought to himself

Oh but you wont die so soon

This thought pleased him and awakened in him a kind warm feeling for
his father

Rely upon your godfather He has enough common sense in his head to
supply the whole town with it All he lacks is courage or he would have
risen high Yes I tell you my days on earth are numbered Indeed it
is high time to prepare myself for death to cast everything aside to
fast and see to it that people bear me goodwill

They will said Foma with confidence

If there were but a reason why they should

And the lodginghouse

Ignat looked at his son and began to laugh

Yakov has had time to tell it to you already The old miser He must
have abused me

A little Foma smiled

Of course Dont I know him

He spoke of it as though it were his own money

Ignat leaned back in his chair and burst into still louder laughter

The old raven eh Thats quite true Whether it be his own money or
mine it is all the same to him There he is trembling now He has an
aim in view the baldheaded fellow Can you tell me what it is

Foma thought awhile and said

I dont know

Eh youre stupid He wants to tell our fortunes

How is that

Come now guess

Foma looked at his father andguessed it His face became gloomy he
slightly raised himself from the armchair and said resolutely

No I dont want to I shall not marry her

Oh Why so She is a strong girl she is not foolish shes his only
child

And Taras The lost one But II dont want to at all

The lost one is gone consequently it is not worthwhile speaking of
him There is a will dear which says All my movable and real estates
shall go to my daughter Lubov And as to the fact that she is your
godfathers daughter well set this right

It is all the same said Foma firmly I shall not marry her

Well it is rather early to speak of it now But why do you dislike her
so much

I do not like such as she is

Soo Just think of it And which women are more to your liking sir
may I ask

Those that are more simple Shes always busy with her Gymnasium
students and with her books Shes become learned Shell be laughing at
my expense said Foma emotionally

That is quite true She is too bold But that is a trifle All sorts of
rust can be removed if you try to do it Thats a matter for the future
And your godfather is a clever old man His was a peaceful sedentary
life sitting in one place he gave a thought to everything It is
worthwhile listening to him for he can see the wrong side of each
and every worldly affair He is our aristocratdescending from Mother
Yekaterinaha ha He understands a great deal about himself And as
his stem was cut off by Taras he decided to put you in Tarass place
do you see

No Id rather select my place myself said Foma stubbornly

You are foolish as yet Ignat smiled in reply to his sons words

Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Aunt Anfisa

Foma Youve come she cried out somewhere behind the doors Foma
rose and went to meet her with a gentle smile

Again his life streamed on slowly calmly monotonously Again the
Exchange and his fathers instructions Retaining a kindly sarcastic and
encouraging tone in his relation toward his son Ignat began to treat
him more strictly He censured him for each and every trifle and
constantly reminded him that he brought him up freely that he was never
in his way and that he never beat him

Other fathers beat fellows like yourself with logs of wood And I never
even touched you with a finger

Evidently I didnt deserve it said Foma one day calmly

Ignat became angry at his son for these words and for the tone

Dont talk so much he roared Youve picked up courage because of
the softness of my hand You find an answer to every word I say Beware
though my hand was soft it can nevertheless still squeeze you so that
tears will gush forth from your heels Youve grown up too soon like
a toadstool just sprung up from the ground You have a bad smell
already

Why are you so angry at me asked Foma perplexed and offended when
his father chanced to be in a happy frame of mind

Because you cannot tolerate it when your father grumbles at you Youre
ready to quarrel immediately

But it is offensive I have not grown worse than I was before Dont I
see how others live at my age

Your head wouldnt fall off from my scolding you And I scold you
because I see there is something in you that is not mine What it is
I do not know but I see it is there And that something is harmful to
you

These words of Ignat made the son very thoughtful Foma also felt
something strange in himself something which distinguished him from the
youth of his age but he too could not understand what it was And he
looked at himself with suspicion

Foma liked to be on the Exchange amid the bustle and talk of the sedate
people who were making deals amounting to thousands of roubles the
respect with which the less welltodo tradesmen greeted and spoke to
himto Foma the son of the millionaireflattered him greatly He
felt happy and proud whenever he successfully managed some part of his
fathers business assuming all responsibility on his own shoulders and
received a smile of approval from his father for it There was in him
a great deal of ambition yearning to appear as a grownup man of
business butjust as before his trip to Permhe lived as in solitude
he still felt no longing for friends although he now came in contact
everyday with the merchants sons of his age They had invited him
more than once to join them in their sprees but he rather rudely and
disdainfully declined their invitations and even laughed at them

I am afraid Your fathers may learn of your sprees and as theyll give
you a drubbing I might also come in for a share

What he did not like in them was that they were leading a dissipated and
depraved life without their fathers knowledge and that the money
they were spending was either stolen from their parents or borrowed on
longtermed promissory notes to be paid with exorbitant interest
They in turn did not like him for this very reserve and aversion which
contained the pride so offensive to them He was timid about speaking to
people older than himself fearing lest he should appear in their eyes
stupid and thickheaded

He often recalled Pelageya and at first he felt melancholy whenever her
image flashed before his imagination But time went on and little by
little rubbed off the bright colours of this woman and before he
was aware of it his thoughts were occupied by the slender angellike
Medinskaya She used to come up to Ignat almost every Sunday with
various requests all of which generally had but one aimto hasten the
building of the lodgingasylum In her presence Foma felt awkward huge
heavy this pained him and he blushed deeply under the endearing look
of Sophya Pavlovnas large eyes He noticed that every time she looked
at him her eyes would grow darker while her upper lip would tremble
and raise itself slightly thus displaying very small white teeth This
always frightened him When his father noticed how steadfastly he was
staring at Medinskaya he told him one day

Dont be staring so much at that face Look out she is like a
birch ember from the outside it is just as modest smooth and
darkaltogether cold to all appearancesbut take it into your hand and
it will burn you

Medinskaya did not kindle in the youth any sensual passion for there
was nothing in her that resembled Pelageya and altogether she was not
at all like other women He knew that shameful rumours about her were
in the air but he did not believe any of them But his relations to her
were changed when he noticed her one day in a carriage beside a stout
man in a gray hat and with long hair falling over his shoulders His
face was like a bladderred and bloated he had neither moustache nor
beard and altogether he looked like a woman in disguise Foma was told
that this was her husband Then dark and contradicting feelings sprang
up within him he felt like insulting the architect and at the same
time he envied and respected him Medinskaya now seemed to him less
beautiful and more accessible he began to feel sorry for her and yet
he thought malignantly

She must surely feel disgusted when he kisses her

And after all this he sometimes perceived in himself some bottomless and
oppressive emptiness which could not be filled up by anythingneither
by the impressions of the day just gone by nor by the recollection
of the past and the Exchange and his affairs and his thoughts of
Medinskayaall were swallowed up by this emptiness It alarmed him in
the dark depth of this emptiness he suspected some hidden existence of
a hostile power as yet formless but already carefully and persistently
striving to become incarnate

In the meantime Ignat changing but little outwardly was growing ever
more restless and querulous and was complaining more often of being ill

I lost my sleep It used to be so sound that even though you had torn
off my skin I would not have felt it While now I toss about from side
to side and I fall asleep only toward morning And every now and then
I awaken My heart beats unevenly now though tired out often thus
tuktuktuk And sometimes it sinks of a suddenand it seems as though
it would soon tear itself away and fall somewhere into the deep into
the bosom Oh Lord have pity upon me through Thy great mercy And
heaving a penitent sigh he would lift heavenward his stern eyes grown
dim now devoid of their bright sparkling glitter

Death keeps an eye on me somewhere close by he said one day morosely
but humbly And indeed it soon felled his big sturdy body to the
ground

This happened in August early in the morning Foma was sound asleep
when suddenly he felt somebody shaking him by the shoulder and a hoarse
voice called at his ear

Get up

He opened his eyes and saw that his father was seated in a chair near
his bed monotonously repeating in a dull voice

Get up get up

The sun had just risen and its light falling on Ignats white linen
shirt had not yet lost its rosy tints

Its early said Foma stretching himself

Well youll sleep enough later

Lazily muffling himself in the blanket Foma asked

Why do you need me

Get up dear will you please exclaimed Ignat adding somewhat
offended It must be necessary since I am waking you

When Foma looked closely at his fathers face he noticed that it was
gray and weary

Are you ill

Slightly

Shall we send for a doctor

The devil take him Ignat waved his hand I am not a young man any
longer I know it as well without him

What

Oh I know it said the old man mysteriously casting a strange
glance around the room Foma was dressing himself and his father with
lowered head spoke slowly

I am afraid to breathe Something tells me that if I should now heave a
deep sigh my heart would burst Today is Sunday After the morning mass
is over send for the priest

What are you talking about papa Foma smiled

Nothing Wash yourself and go into the garden I ordered the samovar
to be brought there Well drink our tea in the morning coolness I feel
like drinking now hot strong tea Be quicker

The old man rose with difficulty from the chair and bent and
barefooted left the room in a staggering gait Foma looked at his
father and a shooting chill of fear made his heart shrink He washed
himself in haste and hurried out into the garden

There under an old spreading appletree sat Ignat in a big oaken
armchair The light of the sun fell in thin stripes through the
branches of the trees upon the white figure of the old man clad in his
nightgarments There was such a profound silence in the garden that
even the rustle of a branch accidentally touched by Fomas clothes
seemed to him like a loud sound and he shuddered On the table before
his father stood the samovar purring like a wellfed tomcat and
exhaling a stream of steam into the air Amid the silence and the fresh
verdure of the garden which had been washed by abundant rains the day
before this bright spot of the boldly shining loud brass seemed to
Foma as something unnecessary as something which suited neither the
time nor the placenor the feeling that sprang up within him at the
sight of the sickly bent old man who was dressed in white and who sat
alone underneath the mute motionless darkgreen foliage wherein red
apples were modestly peeping

Be seated said Ignat

We ought to send for a doctor Foma advised him irresolutely seating
himself opposite him

It isnt necessary Its a little better now in the open air And now
Ill sip some tea and perhaps that will do me more good said Ignat
pouring out tea into the glasses and Foma noticed that the teapot was
trembling in his fathers hand

Drink

Silently moving up one glass for himself Foma bent over it blowing the
foam off the surface of the tea and with pain in his heart hearing the
loud heavy breathing of his father Suddenly something struck against
the table with such force that the dishes began to rattle

Foma shuddered threw up his head and met the frightened almost
senseless look of his fathers eyes Ignat stared at his son and
whispered hoarsely

An apple fell down the devil take it It sounded like the firing of
a gun

Wont you have some cognac in your tea Foma suggested

It is good enough without it

They became silent A flight of finches winged past over the garden
scattering a provokingly cheerful twittering in the air And again the
ripe beauty of the garden was bathed in solemn silence The fright was
still in Ignats eyes

Oh Lord Jesus Christ said he in a low voice making the sign of the
cross Yes There it isthe last hour of my life

Stop papa whispered Foma

Why stop Well have our tea and then send for the priest and for
Mayakin

Id rather send for them now

Theyll soon toll for the massthe priest isnt homeand then theres
no hurry it may pass soon

And he noisily started to sip the tea out of the saucer

I should live another year or two You are young and I am very much
afraid for you Live honestly and firmly do not covet what belongs to
other people take good care of your own

It was hard for him to speak he stopped short and rubbed his chest with
his hand

Do not rely upon others expect but little from them We all live in
order to take not to give Oh Lord Have mercy on the sinner

Somewhere in the distance the deep sound of the bell fell on the silence
of the morning Ignat and Foma crossed themselves three times

After the first sound of the belltone came another then a third and
soon the air was filled with sounds of the churchbells coming from all
sidesflowing measured calling aloud

There they are tolling for the mass said Ignat listening to the
echo of the bellmetal Can you tell the bells by their sounds

No answered Foma

Just listen This one nowdo you hear the bassthis is from the
Nikola Church It was presented by Peter Mitrich Vyaginand this the
hoarse onethis is at the church of Praskeva Pyatnitza

The singing waves of the belltones agitated the air which was filled
with them and they died away in the clear blue of the sky Foma
stared thoughtfully at his fathers face and saw that the alarm was
disappearing from his eyes and that they were now brighter

But suddenly the old mans face turned very red his eyes distended and
rolled out of their orbits his mouth opened with fright and from it
issued a strange hissing sound

FFAAch

Immediately after this Ignats head fell back on his shoulder and his
heavy body slowly slipped down from the chair to the ground as if the
earth had dragged him imperiously unto itself Foma was motionless and
silent for awhile then he rushed up to Ignat lifted his head from the
ground and looked into his face The face was dark motionless and the
wideopen eyes expressed nothingneither pain nor fear nor joy
Foma looked around him As before nobody was in the garden and the
resounding chatter of the bells was still roaring in the air Fomas
hands began to tremble he let go his fathers head and it struck
heavily against the ground Dark thick blood began to gush in a narrow
stream from his open mouth across his blue cheek

Foma struck his breast with both hands and kneeling before the dead
body he wildly cried aloud He was trembling with fright and with eyes
like those of a madman he was searching for someone in the verdure of
the garden



CHAPTER IV

HIS fathers death stupefied Foma and filled him with a strange
sensation quiet was poured into his soula painful immovable quiet
which absorbed all the sounds of life without accounting for it
All sorts of acquaintances were bustling about him they appeared
disappeared said something to himhis replies to them were untimely
and their words called forth no images in him drowning without leaving
any trace in the bottomless depths of the deathlike silence which
filled his soul He neither cried nor grieved nor thought of anything
pale and gloomy with knitted brow he was attentively listening to this
quiet which had forced out all his feelings benumbed his heart and
tightly clutched his brains He was conscious but of the purely physical
sensation of heaviness in all his frame and particularly in his breast
and then it also seemed to him that it was always twilight and even
though the sun was still high in the skyeverything on earth looked
dark and melancholy

The funeral was arranged by Mayakin Hastily and briskly he was bustling
about in the rooms making much clatter with the heels of his boots
he cried at the household help imperiously clapped his godson on the
shoulder consoling him

And why are you petrified Roar and you will feel relieved Your father
was oldold in body Death is prepared for all of us you cannot escape
itconsequently you must not be prematurely torpid You cannot bring
him to life again with your sorrow and your grief is unnecessary
to him for it is said When the body is robbed of the soul by the
terrible angels the soul forgets all relatives and acquaintances
which means that you are of no consequence to him now whether you cry
or laugh But the living must care for the living You had better cry
for this is human It brings much relief to the heart

But neither did these words provoke anything in Fomas head or in his
heart He came to himself however on the day of the funeral thanks to
the persistence of his godfather who was assiduously and oddly trying
to rouse his sad soul

The day of the funeral was cloudy and dreary Amid a heavy cloud of dust
an enormous crowd of people winding like a black ribbon followed
the coffin of Ignat Gordyeeff Here and there flashed the gold of the
priests robes and the dull noise of the slow movement of the crowd
blended in harmony with the solemn music of the choir composed of the
bishops choristers Foma was pushed from behind and from the sides he
walked seeing nothing but the gray head of his father and the mournful
singing resounded in his heart like a melancholy echo And Mayakin
walking beside him kept on intrusively whispering in his ears

Look what a crowdthousands The governor himself came out to
accompany your father to the church the mayor and almost the entire
city council And behind youjust turn around There goes Sophya
Pavlovna The town pays its respects to Ignat

At first Foma did not listen to his godfathers whisper but when he
mentioned Medinskaya he involuntarily looked back and noticed the
governor A little drop of something pleasant fell into his heart at
the sight of this important personage with a bright ribbon across
his shoulder with orders on his breast pacing after the coffin an
expression of sorrow on his stern countenance

Blessed is the road where this soul goeth today Yakov Tarasovich
hummed softly moving his nose and he again whispered in his godsons
ear

Seventyfive thousand roubles is such a sum that you can demand so many
escorts for it Have you heard that Sonka is making arrangements for the
laying of the cornerstone on the fifteenth Just forty days after the
death of your father

Foma again turned back and his eyes met the eyes of Medinskaya He
heaved a deep sigh at her caressing glance and felt relieved at once
as if a warm ray of light penetrated his soul and something melted
there And then and there he considered that it was unbecoming him to
turn his head from side to side

At church Fomas head began to ache and it seemed to him that
everything around and underneath him was shaking In the stifling air
filled with dust with the breathing of the people and the smoke of
the incense the flames of the candles were timidly trembling The meek
image of Christ looked down at him from the big ikon and the flames
of the candles reflected in the tarnished gold of the crown over the
Saviours brow reminded him of drops of blood

Fomas awakened soul was greedily feeding itself on the solemn gloomy
poetry of the liturgy and when the touching citation was heard Come
let us give him the last kiss a loud wailing sob escaped from Fomas
chest and the crowd in church was stirred to agitation by this outburst
of grief

Having uttered the sob Foma staggered His godfather immediately caught
him by his arms and began to push him forward to the coffin singing
quite loudly and with some anger

 Kiss him who was but lately with us
 Kiss Foma kiss himhe is given over to the grave covered with a stone
 He is settling down in darkness and is buried with the dead

Foma touched his fathers forehead with his lips and sprang back from
the coffin with horror

Hold your peace You nearly knocked me down Mayakin remarked to him
in a low voice and these simple calm words supported Foma better than
his godfathers hands

Ye that behold me mute and lifeless before you weep for me brethren
and friends begged Ignat through the mouth of the Church But his son
was not crying any longer his horror was called forth by the black
swollen face of his father and this horror somewhat sobered his soul
which had been intoxicated by the mournful music of the Churchs lament
for its sinful son He was surrounded by acquaintances who were kindly
consoling him he listened to them and understood that they all felt
sorry for him and that he became dear to them And his godfather
whispered in his ear

See how they all fawn upon you The tomcats have smelt the fat

These words were unpleasant to Foma but they were useful to him as
they caused him to answer at all events

At the cemetery when they sang for Ignats eternal memory he cried
again bitterly and loud His godfather immediately seized him by the
arms and led him away from the grave speaking to him earnestly

What a fainthearted fellow you are Do I not feel sorry for him I
have known his real value while you were but his son And yet I do
not cry For more than thirty years we lived together in perfect
harmonyhow much had been spoken how much thoughthow much sorrow
drunk You are young it is not for you to grieve Your life is before
you and you will be rich in all sorts of friendship while I am old
and now that I buried my only friend I am like a pauper I can no
longer make a bosom friend

The old mans voice began to jar and squeak queerly His face was
distorted his lips were stretched into a big grimace and were
quivering and from his small eyes frequent tears were running over the
now contracted wrinkles of his face He looked so pitiful and so unlike
himself that Foma stopped short pressed him close to his body with the
tenderness of a strong man and cried with alarm

Dont cry fatherdarling Dont cry

There you have it said Mayakin faintly and heaving a deep sigh he
suddenly turned again into a firm and clever old man

You must not cry said he mysteriously seating himself in the
carriage beside his godson You are now the commanderinchief in the
war and you must command your soldiers bravely Your soldiers are the
roubles and you have a great army of these Make war incessantly

Surprised at the quickness of his transformation Foma listened to his
words and for some reason or other they reminded him of those clods of
earth which the people threw into Ignats grave upon his coffin

On whom am I to make war said Foma with a sigh

Ill teach you that Did your father tell you that I was a clever old
man and that you should mind me

He did

Then do mind me If my mind should be added to your youthful strength
a good victory might be won Your father was a great man but he did not
look far before him and he could not take my advice He gained success
in life not with his mind but more with his head Oh what will become
of you You had better move into my house for you will feel lonesome in
yours

Aunt is there

Aunt She is sick She will not live long

Do not speak of it begged Foma in a low voice

And I will speak of it You need not fear deathyou are not an old
woman on the oven Live fearlessly and do what you were appointed to
do Man is appointed for the organisation of life on earth Man is
capitallike a rouble he is made up of trashy copper groshes and
copecks From the dust of the earth as it is said and even as he
has intercourse with the world he absorbs grease and oil sweat and
tearsa soul and a mind form themselves in him And from this he starts
to grow upward and downward Now you see his price is a grosh now a
fifteen copeck silver piece now a hundred roubles and sometimes he is
above any price He is put into circulation and he must bring interests
to life Life knows the value of each of us and will not check our
course before time Nobody dear works to his own detriment if he is
wise And life has saved up much wisdom Are you listening

I am

And what do you understand

Everything

You are probably lying Mayakin doubted

But why must we die asked Foma in a low voice

Mayakin looked into his face with regret smacked his lips and said

A wise man would never ask such a question A wise man knows for
himself that if it is a river it must be flowing somewhere and if it
were standing in one place it would be a swamp

Youre simply mocking me at random said Foma sternly The sea is
not flowing anywhere

The sea receives all rivers into itself and then powerful storms rage
in it at times Then the sea of life also submits on agitation stirred
up by men and death renovates the waters of the sea of life that they
might not become spoiled No matter how many people are dying they are
nevertheless forever growing in number

What of it But my father is dead

You will die as well

Then what have I to do with the fact that people are growing in
number Foma smiled sadly

Eh he he sighed Mayakin That indeed concerns none of us There
your trousers probably reason in the same way what have we to do with
the fact that there are all sorts of stuff in the world But you do not
mind themyou wear them out and throw them away

Foma glanced at his godfather reproachfully and noticing that the old
man was smiling he was astonished and he asked respectfully

Can it be true father that you do not fear death

Most of all I fear foolishness my child replied Mayakin with humble
bitterness My opinion is this if a fool give you honey spit upon it
if a wise man give you poison drink it And I will tell you that the
perch has a weak soul since his fins do not stand on end

The old mans mocking words offended and angered Foma He turned aside
and said

You can never speak without these subterfuges

I cannot exclaimed Mayakin and his eyes began to sparkle with alarm
Each man uses the very same tongue he has Do I seem to be stern Do
I

Foma was silent

Eh you Know thishe loves who teaches Remember this well And as to
death do not think of it It is foolish dear for a live man to think
of death Ecclesiastes reflected on death better than anybody else
reflected on it and said that a living dog is better than a dead lion

They came home The street near the house was crowded with carriages
and from the open windows came loud sounds of talk As soon as Foma
appeared in the hall he was seized by the arms and led away to the
table and there was urged to drink and eat something A marketplace
noise smote the air the hall was crowded and suffocating Silently
Foma drank a glass of vodka then another and a third Around him they
were munching and smacking their lips the vodka poured out from the
bottles was gurgling the wineglasses were tinkling They were speaking
of dried sturgeon and of the bass of the soloist of the bishops choir
and then again of the dried sturgeon and then they said that the mayor
also wished to make a speech but did not venture to do so after the
bishop had spoken fearing lest he should not speak so well as the
bishop Someone was telling with feeling

The deceased one used to do thus he would cut off a slice of salmon
pepper it thickly cover it with another slice of salmon and then send
it down immediately after a drink

Let us follow his example roared a thick basso Offended to the
quick Foma looked with a frown at the fat lips and at the jaws chewing
the tasty food and he felt like crying out and driving away all these
people whose sedateness had but lately inspired him with respect for
them

You had better be more kind more sociable said Mayakin in a low
voice coming up to him

Why are they gobbling here Is this a tavern cried Foma angrily

Hush Mayakin remarked with fright and hastily turned to look around
with a kind smile on his face

But it was too late his smile was of no avail Fomas words had been
overheard the noise and the talk was subsiding some of the guests
began to bustle about hurriedly others offended frowned put down
their forks and knives and walked away from the table all looking at
Foma askance

Silent and angry he met these glances without lowering his eyes

I ask you to come up to the table cried Mayakin gleaming amid the
crowd of people like an ember amid ashes Be seated pray Theyre soon
serving pancakes

Foma shrugged his shoulders and walked off toward the door saying
aloud

I shall not eat

He heard a hostile rumbling behind him and his godfathers wheedling
voice saying to somebody

Its for grief Ignat was at once father and mother to him

Foma came out in the garden and sat down on the same place where his
father had died The feeling of loneliness and grief oppressed his
heart He unbuttoned the collar of his shirt to make his breathing
easier rested his elbows on the table and with his head tightly
pressed between his hands he sat motionless It was drizzling and the
leaves of the appletree were rustling mournfully under the drops of the
rain He sat there for a long time alone motionless watching how the
small drops were falling from the appletree His head was heavy from
the vodka and in his heart there was a growing grudge against men
Some indefinite impersonal feelings and thoughts were springing up and
vanishing within him before him flashed the bald skull of his godfather
with a little crown of silver hair and with a dark face which resembled
the faces of the ancient ikons This face with the toothless mouth and
the malicious smile rousing in Foma hatred and fear augmented in
him the consciousness of solitude Then he recalled the kind eyes of
Medinskaya and her small graceful figure and beside her arose the
tall robust and rosycheeked Lubov Mayakina with smiling eyes and with
a big light goldencoloured braid Do not rely upon men expect but
little at their handshis fathers words began to ring in his memory
He sighed sadly and cast a glance around him The tree leaves were
fluttering from the rain and the air was full of mournful sounds The
gray sky seemed as though weeping and on the trees cold tears were
trembling And Fomas soul was dry dark it was filled with a painful
feeling of orphanhood But this feeling gave birth to the question

How shall I live now that I am alone

The rain drenched his clothes and when he felt that he was shivering
with cold he arose and went into the house

Life was tugging him from all sides giving him no chance to be
concentrated in thinking of and grieving for his father and on the
fortieth day after Ignats death Foma attired in holiday clothes
with a pleasant feeling in his heart went to the ceremony of the
cornerstone laying of the lodgingasylum Medinskaya notified him in
a letter the day before that he had been elected as a member of the
building committee and also as honorary member of the society of which
she was president This pleased him and he was greatly agitated by the
part he was to play today at the laying of the cornerstone On his way
he thought of how everything would be and how he should behave in order
not to be confused before the people

Eh eh Hold on

He turned around Mayakin came hastening to him from the sidewalk
He was in a frockcoat that reached his heels in a high cap and he
carried a huge umbrella in his hand

Come on take me up there said the old man cleverly jumping into the
carriage like a monkey To tell the truth I was waiting for you I was
looking around thinking it was time for you to go

Are you going there asked Foma

Of course I must see how they will bury my friends money in the
ground

Foma looked at him askance and was silent Why do you frown upon me
Dont fear you will also start out as a benefactor among men

What do you mean asked Foma reservedly Ive read in the newspaper
this morning that you were elected as a member of the building committee
and also as an honorary member of Sophyas society

Yes

This membership will eat into your pocket sighed Mayakin

That wouldnt ruin me

I dont know it observed the old man maliciously

I speak of this more because there is altogether very little wisdom in
this charity business and I may even say that it isnt a business at
all but simply harmful nonsense

Is it harmful to aid people asked Foma hotly

Eh you cabbage head said Mayakin with a smile You had better come
up to my house Ill open your eyes in regard to this I must teach you
Will you come

Very well I will come replied Foma

So And in the meantime hold yourself proud at the laying of the
cornerstone Stand in view of everybody If I dont tell this to you
you might hide yourself behind somebodys back

Why should I hide myself said Foma displeased

Thats just what I say there is no reason why For the money was
donated by your father and you are entitled to the honour as his heir
Honour is just the same as money With honour a business man will get
credit everywhere and everywhere there is a way open to him Then come
forward so that everybody may see you and that if you do five copecks
worth of work you should get a rouble in return for it And if you will
hide yourselfnothing but foolishness will be the result

They arrived at their destination where all the important people had
gathered already and an enormous crowd of people surrounded the piles
of wood bricks and earth The bishop the governor the representatives
of the citys aristocracy and the administration formed together with
the splendidly dressed ladies a big bright group and looked at the
efforts of the two stonemasons who were preparing the bricks and the
lime Mayakin and his godson wended their way toward this group He
whispered to Foma

Lose no courage these people have robbed their bellies to cover
themselves with silk

And he greeted the governor before the bishop in a respectfully
cheerful voice

How do you do your Excellency Give me your blessing your Holiness

Ah Yakov Tarasovich exclaimed the governor with a friendly smile
shaking and squeezing Mayakins hand while the old man was at the same
time kissing the bishops hand How are you deathless old man

I thank you humbly your Excellency My respects to Sophya Pavlovna
Mayakin spoke fast whirling like a pegtop amid the crowd of people
In a minute he managed to shake hands with the presiding justice of the
court with the prosecutor with the mayorin a word with all those
people whom he considered it necessary to greet first such as these
however were few He jested smiled and at once attracted everybodys
attention to his little figure and Foma with downcast head stood
behind him looking askance at these people wrapped in costly stuffs
embroidered with gold he envied the old mans adroitness and lost his
courage and feeling that he was losing his couragehe grew still
more timid But now Mayakin seized him by the hand and drew him up to
himself

There your Excellency this is my godson Foma the late Ignats only
son

Ah said the governor in his basso Im very pleased I sympathise
with you in your misfortune young man he said shaking Fomas hand
and became silent then he added resolutely and confidently To lose a
father that is a very painful misfortune

And having waited about two seconds for Fomas answer he turned away
from him addressing Mayakin approvingly

I am delighted with the speech you made yesterday in the city hall
Beautiful clever Yakov Tarasovich Proposing to use the money for this
public club they do not understand the real needs of the population

And then your Excellency a small capital means that the city will
have to add its own money

Perfectly true Perfectly true

Temperance I say is good Would to God that all were sober I dont
drink either but what is the use of these performances libraries and
all that since the people cannot even read

The governor replied approvingly

Here I say you better use this money for a technical institution If
it should be established on a small plan this money alone will suffice
and in case it shouldnt we can ask for more in St Petersburgtheyll
give it to us Then the city wouldnt have to add of its own money and
the whole affair would be more sensible

Precisely I fully agree with you But how the liberals began to cry at
you Eh Ha ha

That has always been their business to cry

The deep cough of the archdeacon of the cathedral announced the
beginning of the divine service

Sophya Pavlovna came up to Foma greeted him and said in a sad low
voice

I looked at your face on the day of the funeral and my heart saddened
My God I thought how he must suffer

And Foma listened to her and felt as though he was drinking honey

These cries of yours they shook my soul my poor child I may speak to
you this way for I am an old woman already

You exclaimed Foma softly

Isnt that so she asked naively looking into his face

Foma was silent his head bent on his breast

Dont you believe that I am an old woman

I believe you that is I believe everything you may say only this is
not true said Foma feelingly in a low voice

What is not true What do you believe me

No not this but that Iexcuse me I cannot speak said Foma
sadly all aflush with confusion I am not cultured

You need not trouble yourself on this account said Medinskaya
patronisingly You are so young and education is accessible
to everybody But there are people to whom education is not only
unnecessary but who can also be harmed by it Those that are pure of
heart sanguine sincere like children and you are of those people
You are are you not

What could Foma say in answer to this question He said sincerely

I thank you humbly

And noticing that his words called forth a gay gleam in Medinskayas
eyes Foma appeared ridiculous and stupid in his own eyes he
immediately became angry at himself and said in a muffled voice

Yes I am such I always speak my mind I cannot deceive If I see
something to laugh at I laugh openly I am stupid

What makes you speak that way said the woman reproachfully and
adjusting her dress she accidentally stroked Fomas hand in which he
held his hat This made him look at his wrist and smile joyously and
confusedly

You will surely be present at the dinner wont you asked Medinskaya

Yes

And tomorrow at the meeting in my house

Without fail

And perhaps sometime you will drop in simply on a visit wouldnt
you

II thank you Ill come

I must thank you for the promise

They became silent In the air soared the reverently soft voice of the
bishop who recited the prayer expressively outstretching his hand over
the place where the cornerstone of the house was laid

May neither the wind nor water nor anything else bring harm unto it
may it be completed in thy benevolence and free all those that are to
live in it from all kinds of calumny

How rich and beautiful our prayers are are they not asked
Medinskaya

Yes said Foma shortly without understanding her words and feeling
that he was blushing again

They will always be opponents of our commercial interests Mayakin
whispered loudly and convincingly standing beside the city mayor not
far from Foma What is it to them All they want is somehow to deserve
the approval of the newspaper But they cannot reach the main point
They live for mere display not for the organisation of life these
are their only measures the newspapers and Sweden Mayakin speaks of
Sweden meaning SwitzerlandTranslators note The doctor scoffed at
me all day yesterday with this Sweden The public education says he
in Sweden and everything else there is firstclass But what is Sweden
anyway It may be that Sweden is but a fib is but used as an example
and that there is no education whatever or any of the other things
there And then we dont live for the sake of Sweden and Sweden cannot
put us to test We have to make our lip according to our own last Isnt
it so

And the archdeacon droned his head thrown back

Eternal meemoory to the founder of this hoouse

Foma shuddered but Mayakin was already by his side and pulling him by
the sleeve asked

Are you going to the dinner

And Medinskayas velvetlike warm little hand glided once more over
Fomas hand

The dinner was to Foma a real torture For the first time in his
life among these uniformed people he saw that they were eating and
speakingdoing everything better than he and he felt that between him
and Medinskaya who was seated just opposite him was a high mountain
not a table Beside him sat the secretary of the society of which Foma
had been made an honorary member he was a young court officer bearing
the odd name of Ookhtishchev As if to make his name appear more
absurd than it really was he spoke in a loud ringing tenor and
altogetherplump short roundfaced and a lively talkerhe looked
like a brand new bell

The very best thing in our society is the patroness the most
reasonable is what we are doingcourting the patroness the most
difficult is to tell the patroness such a compliment as would satisfy
her and the most sensible thing is to admire the patroness silently and
hopelessly So that in reality you are a member not of the Society
of Solicitude and so on but of the Society of Tantaluses which is
composed of persons bent on pleasing Sophya Medinskaya

Foma listened to his chatter now and then looking at the patroness who
was absorbed in a conversation with the chief of the police Foma roared
in reply to his interlocutor pretending to be busy eating and he
wished that all this would end the sooner He felt that he was wretched
stupid ridiculous and he was certain that everybody was watching and
censuring him This tied him with invisible shackles thus checking his
words and his thoughts At last he went so far that the line of various
physiognomies stretched out by the table opposite him seemed to him a
long and wavy white strip besprinkled with laughing eyes and all these
eyes were pricking him unpleasantly and painfully

Mayakin sat near the city mayor waved his fork in the air quickly
and kept on talking all the time now contracting now expanding the
wrinkles of his face The mayor a grayheaded redfaced shortnecked
man stared at him like a bull with obstinate attention and at times he
rapped on the edge of the table with his big finger affirmatively The
animated talk and laughter drowned his godfathers bold speech and Foma
was unable to hear a single word of it much more so that the tenor of
the secretary was unceasingly ringing in his ears

Look there the archdeacon arose he is filling his lungs with air he
will soon proclaim an eternal memory for Ignat Matveyich

May I not go away asked Foma in a low voice

Why not Everybody will understand this

The deacons resounding voice drowned and seemed to have crushed the
noise in the hail the eminent merchants fixed their eyes on the big
wideopen mouth from which a deep sound was streaming forth and
availing himself of this moment Foma arose from his seat and left the
hall

After awhile he breathed freely and sitting in his cab thought sadly
that there was no place for him amid these people Inwardly he called
them polished He did not like their brilliancy their faces their
smiles or their words but the freedom and the cleverness of their
movements their ability to speak much and on any subject their pretty
costumesall this aroused in him a mixture of envy and respect for
them He felt sad and oppressed at the consciousness of being unable to
talk so much and so fluently as all these people and here he recalled
that Luba Mayakina had more than once scoffed at him on this account

Foma did not like Mayakins daughter and since he had learned from his
father of Mayakins intention to marry him to Luba the young Gordyeeff
began to shun her But after his fathers death he was almost every day
at the Mayakins and somehow Luba said to him one day

I am looking at you and do you knowyou do not resemble a merchant
at all

Nor do you look like a merchants daughter said Foma and looked at
her suspiciously He did not understand the meaning of her words did
she mean to offend him or did she say these words without any kind
thoughts

Thank God for this said she and smiled to him a kind friendly smile

What makes you so glad he asked

The fact that we dont resemble our fathers

Foma glanced at her in astonishment and kept silent

Tell me frankly said she lowering her voice you do not love my
father do you You dont like him

Not very much said Foma slowly

And I dislike him very much

What for

For everything When you grow wiser you will know it yourself Your
father was a better man

Of course said Foma proudly

After this conversation an attachment sprang up between them almost
immediately and growing stronger from day to day it soon developed
into friendship though a somewhat odd friendship it was

Though Luba was not older than her godbrother she nevertheless treated
him as an older person would treat a little boy She spoke to him
condescendingly often jesting at his expense her talk was always full
of words which were unfamiliar to Foma and she pronounced these
words with particular emphasis and with evident satisfaction She was
especially fond of speaking about her brother Taras whom she had never
seen but of whom she was telling such stories as would make him look
like Aunt Anfisas brave and noble robbers Often when complaining of
her father she said to Foma

You will also be just such a skinflint

All this was unpleasant to the youth and stung his vanity But at
times she was straightforward simpleminded and particularly kind and
friendly to him then he would unburden his heart before her and for a
long time they would share each others thoughts and feelings

Both spoke a great deal and spoke sincerely but neither one understood
the other it seemed to Foma that whatever Luba had to say was foreign
to him and unnecessary to her and at the same time he clearly saw that
his awkward words did not at all interest her and that she did not care
to understand them No matter how long these conversations lasted they
gave both of them the sensation of discomfort and dissatisfaction As
if an invisible wall of perplexity had suddenly arisen and stood between
them They did not venture to touch this wall or to tell each other
that they felt it was therethey resumed their conversations dimly
conscious that there was something in each of them that might bind and
unite them

When Foma arrived at his godfathers house he found Luba alone She
came out to meet him and it was evident that she was either ill or out
of humour her eyes were flashing feverishly and were surrounded with
black circles Feeling cold she muffled herself in a warm shawl and
said with a smile

It is good that youve come For I was sitting here alone it is
lonesomeI dont feel like going anywhere Will you drink tea

I will What is the matter with you are you ill

Go to the diningroom and Ill tell them to bring the samovar she
said not answering his question

He went into one of the small rooms of the house whose two windows
overlooked the garden In the middle of the room stood an oval table
surrounded with oldfashioned leathercovered chairs on one partition
hung a clock in a long case with a glass door in the corner was a
cupboard for dishes and opposite the windows by the walls was an
oaken sideboard as big as a fairsized room

Are you coming from the banquet asked Luba entering

Foma nodded his head mutely

Well how was it Grand

It was terrible Foma smiled I sat there as if on hot coals They
all looked there like peacocks while I looked like a barnowl

Luba was taking out dishes from the cupboard and said nothing to Foma

Really why are you so sad asked Foma again glancing at her gloomy
face

She turned to him and said with enthusiasm and anxiety

Ah Foma What a book Ive read If you could only understand it

It must be a good book since it worked you up in this way said Foma
smiling

I did not sleep I read all night long Just think of it you readand
it seems to you that the gates of another kingdom are thrown open
before you And the people there are different and their language is
different everything different Life itself is different there

I dont like this said Foma dissatisfied Thats all fiction
deceit so is the theatre The merchants are ridiculed there Are they
really so stupid Of course Take your father for example

The theatre and the school are one and the same Foma said Luba
instructively The merchants used to be like this And what deceit can
there be in books

Just as in fairytales nothing is real

You are wrong You have read no books how can you judge Books are
precisely real They teach you how to live

Come come Foma waved his hand Drop it no good will come out of
your books There take your father for example does he read books
And yet he is clever I looked at him today and envied him His
relations with everybody are so free so clever he has a word for each
and every one You can see at once that whatever he should desire he is
sure to attain

What is he striving for exclaimed Luba Nothing but money But there
are people that want happiness for all on earth and to gain this end
they work without sparing themselves they suffer and perish How can my
father be compared with these

You need not compare them They evidently like one thing while your
father likes another

They do not like anything

Hows that

They want to change everything

So they do strive for something said Foma thoughtfully They do
wish for something

They wish for happiness for all cried Luba hotly I cant
understand this said Foma nodding his head Who cares there for my
happiness And then again what happiness can they give me since I
myself do not know as yet what I want No you should have rather
looked at those that were at the banquet

Those are not men announced Luba categorically

I do not know what they are in your eyes but you can see at once that
they know their place A clever easygoing lot

Ah Foma exclaimed Luba vexed You understand nothing Nothing
agitates you You are an idler

Now thats going too far Ive simply not had time enough to see where
I am

You are simply an empty man said Luba resolutely and firmly

You were not within my soul replied Foma calmly You cannot know my
thoughts

What is there that you should think of said Luba shrugging her
shoulders

So First of all I am alone Secondly I must live Dont I understand
that it is altogether impossible for me to live as I am now I do not
care to be made the laughingstock of others I cannot even speak
to people No nor can I think Foma concluded his words and smiled
confusedly

It is necessary to read to study Luba advised him convincingly
pacing up and down the room

Something is stirring within my soul Foma went on not looking at
her as though speaking to himself but I cannot tell what it is
I see for instance that whatever my godfather says is clever and
reasonable But that does not attract me The other people are by far
more interesting to me

You mean the aristocrats asked Luba

Yes

Thats just the place for you said Luba with a smile of contempt
Eh you Are they men Do they have souls

How do you know them You are not acquainted with them

And the books Have I not read books about them

The maid brought in the samovar and the conversation was interrupted
Luba made tea in silence while Foma looked at her and thought of
Medinskaya He was wishing to have a talk with her

Yes said the girl thoughtfully I am growing more and more
convinced everyday that it is hard to live What shall I do Marry
Whom Shall I marry a merchant who will do nothing but rob people all
his life nothing but drink and play cards A savage I do not want
it I want to be an individual I am such for I know how wrong the
construction of life is Shall I study My father will not allow this
Oh Lord Shall I run away I have not enough courage What am I to do

She clasped her hands and bowed her head over the table

If you knew but how repulsive everything is There is not a living soul
around here Since my mother died my father drove everyone away Some
went off to study Lipa too left us She writes me

Read Ah I am reading I am reading she exclaimed with despair in
her voice and after a moments silence she went on sadly

Books do not contain what the heart needs most and theres much I
cannot understand in them And then I feel weary to be reading all the
time alone alone I want to speak to a man but there is none to speak
to I feel disgusted We live but once and it is high time for me to
live and yet there is not a soul Wherefore shall I live Lipa tells
me Read and you will understand it I want bread and she gives me
a stone I understand what one must doone must stand up for what he
loves and believes He must fight for it

And she concluded uttering something like a moan

But I am alone Whom shall I fight There are no enemies here There
are no men I live here in a prison

Foma listened to her words fixedly examining the fingers of his hand
he felt that in her words was some great distress but he could not
understand her And when she became silent depressed and sad he found
nothing to tell her save a few words that were like a reproach

There you yourself say that books are worthless to you and yet you
instruct me to read

She looked into his face and anger flashed in her eyes

Oh how I wish that all these torments would awaken within you the
torments that constantly oppress me That your thoughts like mine
would rob you of your sleep that you too would be disgusted with
everything and with yourself as well I despise every one of you I
hate you

All aflush she looked at him so angrily and spoke with so much
spitefulness that in his astonishment he did not even feel offended by
her She had never before spoken to him in such manner

Whats the matter with you he asked her

I hate you too You what are you Dead empty how will you live
What will you give to mankind she said with malice in a low voice

Ill give nothing let them strive for it themselves answered Foma
knowing that these words would augment her anger

Unfortunate creature exclaimed the girl with contempt

The assurance and the power of her reproaches involuntarily compelled
Foma to listen attentively to her spiteful words he felt there was
common sense in them He even came nearer to her but she enraged and
exasperated turned away from him and became silent

It was still light outside and the reflection of the setting sun lay
still on the branches of the lindentrees before the windows but the
room was already filled with twilight and the sideboard the clock and
the cupboard seemed to have grown in size The huge pendulum peeped
out every moment from beneath the glass of the clockcase and flashing
dimly was hiding with a weary sound now on the right side now on
the left Foma looked at the pendulum and he began to feel awkward and
lonesome Luba arose and lighted the lamp which was hanging over the
table The girls face was pale and stern

You went for me said Foma reservedly What for I cant
understand

I dont want to speak to you replied Luba angrily

Thats your affair But nevertheless what wrong have I done to you

You

I

Understand me I am suffocating It is close here Is this life Is
this the way how to live What am I I am a hangeron in my fathers
house They keep me here as a housekeeper Then theyll marry me Again
housekeeping Its a swamp I am drowning suffocating

And what have I to do with it asked Foma

You are no better than the others

And therefore I am guilty before you

Yes guilty You must desire to be better

But do I not wish it exclaimed Foma

The girl was about to tell him something but at this time the bell
began to ring somewhere and she said in a low voice leaning back in
her chair

Its father

I would not feel sorry if he stayed away a little longer said Foma
I wish I could listen to you some more You speak so very oddly

Ah my children my doves exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich appearing in
the doorway Youre drinking tea Pour out some tea for me Lugava

Sweetly smiling and rubbing his hands he sat down near Foma and asked
playfully jostling him in the side

What have you been cooing about

Soabout different trifles answered Luba

I havent asked you have I said her father to her with a grimace
You just sit there hold your tongue and mind your womans affairs

Ive been telling her about the dinner Foma interrupted his
godfathers words

Aha Sooo Well then Ill also speak about the dinner I have been
watching you of late You dont behave yourself sensibly

What do you mean asked Foma knitting his brow ill pleased

I just mean that your behaviour is preposterous and thats all When
the governor for instance speaks to you you keep quiet

What should I tell him He says that it is a misfortune to lose a
father Well I know it What could I tell him

But as the Lord willed it so I do not grumble your Excellency Thats
what you should have said or something in this spirit Governors my
dear are very fond of meekness in a man

Was I to look at him like a lamb said Foma with a smile

You did look like a lamb and that was unnecessary You must look
neither like a lamb nor like a wolf but just play off before him as
though saying You are our father we are your children and he will
immediately soften

And what is this for

For any event A governor my dear can always be of use somewhere

What do you teach him papa said Luba indignantly in a low voice

Well what

To dance attendance

You lie you learned fool I teach him politics not dancing
attendance I teach him the politics of life You had better leave us
alone Depart from evil and prepare some lunch for us Go ahead

Luba rose quickly and throwing the towel across the back of the chair
left the room Mayakin winking his eyes looked after her tapped the
table with his fingers and said

I shall instruct you Foma I shall teach you the most genuine true
knowledge and philosophy and if you understand them your life will be
faultless

Foma saw how the wrinkles on the old mans forehead were twitching and
they seemed to him like lines of Slavonic letters

First of all Foma since you live on this earth it is your duty to
think over everything that takes place about you Why That you may
not suffer for your own senselessness and may not harm others by your
folly Now every act of man is doublefaced Foma One is visible to
allthis is the wrong side the other is concealedand that is the
real one It is that one that you must be able to find in order to
understand the sense of the thing Take for example the lodgingasylums
the workhouses the poorhouses and other similar institutions Just
consider what are they for

What is there to consider here said Foma wearily Everybody knows
what they are forfor the poor and feeble

Eh dear Sometimes everybody knows that a certain man is a rascal and
a scoundrel and yet all call him Ivan or Peter and instead of abusing
him they respectfully add his fathers name to his own

What has this to do with it

Its all to the point So you say that these houses are for the poor
for beggars consequently in accordance with Christs commandment
Very well But who is the beggar The beggar is a man forced by fate
to remind us of Christ he is a brother of Christ he is the bell of the
Lord and he rings in life to rouse our conscience to arouse the satiety
of the flesh of man He stands by the window and sings out For the
sake of Christ and by his singing he reminds us of Christ of His holy
commandment to help the neighbour But men have so arranged their life
that it is impossible for them to act according to the teachings of
Christ and Jesus Christ has become altogether unnecessary to us Not
one time but perhaps a hundred thousand times have we turned Him
over to the cross and yet we cannot drive Him altogether out of life
because His poor brethren sing His Holy name on the streets and thus
remind us of Him And now we have arranged to lock up these beggars
in separate houses that they should not walk around on the streets and
should not rouse our conscience

Clever whispered Foma amazed staring fixedly at his godfather

Aha exclaimed Mayakin his eyes beaming with triumph

How is it that my father did not think of this asked Foma uneasily

Just wait Listen further it is still worse So you see we have
arranged to lock them up in all sorts of houses and that they might be
kept there cheaply we have compelled those old and feeble beggars
to work and we need give no alms now and since our streets have been
cleared of the various ragged beggars we do not see their terrible
distress and poverty and we may therefore think that all men on earth
are wellfed shod and clothed Thats what all these different houses
are for for the concealment of the truth for the banishment of Christ
from our life Is this clear to you

Yes said Foma confused by the old mans clever words

And this is not all The pool is not yet baled out to the bottom
exclaimed Mayakin swinging his hand in the air with animation

The wrinkles of his face were in motion his long ravenous nose was
stirring and in his voice rang notes of irritability and emotion

Now let us look at this thing from the other side Who contributes
most in favour of the poor for the support of these houses asylums
poorhouses The rich people the merchants our body of merchants
Very well And who commands our life and regulates it The nobles the
functionaries and all sorts of other people not belonging to our class
From them come the laws the newspapers scienceeverything from them
Before they were landowners now their land was snatched away from
themand they started out in service Very well But who are the most
powerful people today The merchant is the supreme power in an empire
because he has the millions on his side Isnt that so

True assented Foma eager to hear the sooner that which was to
follow and which was already sparkling in the eyes of his godfather

Just mark this the old man went on distinctly and impressively We
merchants had no hand in the arrangement of life nor do we have a voice
or a hand in it today Life was arranged by others and it is they that
multiplied all sorts of scabs in lifeidlers and poor unfortunates
and since by multiplying them they obstructed life and spoilt itit is
justly judging now their duty to purify it But we are purifying it
we contribute money for the poor we look after themwe judge it for
yourself why should we mend anothers rags since we did not tear them
Why should we repair a house since others have lived in it and since
it belongs to others Were it not wiser for us to step aside and watch
until a certain time how rottenness is multiplying and choking those
that are strangers to us They cannot conquer it they have not the
means to do it Then they will turn to us and say Pray help us
gentlemen and well tell them Let us have room for our work Rank us
among the builders of this same life And as soon as they do this we
too will have to clear life at one sweep of all sorts of filth and
chaff Then the Emperor will see with his clear eyes who are really his
faithful servants and how much wisdom they have saved up while their
hands were idle Do you understand

Of course I do exclaimed Foma

When his godfather spoke of the functionaries Foma reminded himself
of the people that were present at the dinner he recalled the brisk
secretary and a thought flashed through his mind that this stout little
man has in all probability an income of no more than a thousand roubles
a year while he Foma has a million But that man lives so easily and
freely while he Foma does not know how to live is indeed abashed to
live This comparison and his godfathers speech roused in him a whirl
of thoughts but he had time to grasp and express only one of them

Indeed do we work for the sake of money only Whats the use of money
if it can give us no power

Aha said Mayakin winking his eyes

Eh exclaimed Foma offended How about my father Have you spoken to
him

I spoke to him for twenty years

Well how about him

My words did not reach him The crown of your fathers head was rather
thick His soul was open to all while his mind was hidden away far
within him Yes he made a blunder and I am very sorry about the
money

I am not sorry for the money

You should have tried to earn even a tenth part of it then speak

May I come in came Lubas voice from behind the door

Yes step right in said the father

Will you have lunch now she asked entering

Let us have it

She walked up to the sideboard and soon the dishes were rattling Yakov
Tarasovich looked at her moved his lips and suddenly striking Fomas
knee with his hand he said to him

Thats the way my godson Think

Foma responded with a smile and thought But hes clevercleverer than
my father

But another voice within him immediately replied

Cleverer but worse



CHAPTER V

FOMAS dual relation toward Mayakin grew stronger and stronger as time
went on listening to his words attentively and with eager curiosity he
felt that each meeting with his godfather was strengthening in him the
feeling of hostility toward the old man Sometimes Yakov Tarasovich
roused in his godson a feeling akin to fear sometimes even physical
aversion The latter usually came to Foma whenever the old man was
pleased with something and laughed From laughter the old mans wrinkles
would tremble thus changing the expression of his face every now
and then his dry thin lips would stretch out and move nervously
displaying black broken teeth and his red little beard was as though
aflame His laughter sounded like the squeaking of rusty hinges and
altogether the old man looked like a lizard at play Unable to conceal
his feelings Foma often expressed them to Mayakin rather rudely both
in words and in gesture but the old man pretending not to notice it
kept a vigilant eye on him directing his each and every step Wholly
absorbed by the steamship affairs of the young Gordyeeff he even
neglected his own little shop and allowed Foma considerable leisure
time Thanks to Mayakins important position in town and to his
extensive acquaintance on the Volga business was splendid but
Mayakins zealous interest in his affairs strengthened Fomas suspicions
that his godfather was firmly resolved to marry him to Luba and this
made the old man more repulsive to him

He liked Luba but at the same time she seemed suspicious and dangerous
for him She did not marry and Mayakin never said a word about it he
gave no evening parties invited none of the youths to his house and did
not allow Luba to leave the house And all her girl friends were married
already Foma admired her words and listened to her just as eagerly as
to her father but whenever she started to speak of Taras with love and
anguish it seemed to him that she was hiding another man under that
name perhaps that same Yozhov who according to her words had to leave
the university for some reason or other and go to Moscow There was a
great deal of simplemindedness and kindness in her which pleased Foma
and ofttimes her words awakened in him a feeling of pity for her it
seemed to him that she was not alive that she was dreaming though
awake

His conduct at the funeral feast for his father became known to all the
merchants and gave him a bad reputation On the Exchange he noticed
everybody looked at him sneeringly malevolently and spoke to him in
some peculiar way One day he heard behind him a low exclamation full
of contempt

Gordyeeff Milksop

He felt that this was said of him but he did not turn around to see who
it was that flung those words at him The rich people who had inspired
him with timidity before were now losing in his eyes the witchery of
their wealth and wisdom They had more than once snatched out of his
hands this or that profitable contract he clearly saw that they would
do it again and they all seemed to him alikegreedy for money always
ready to cheat one another When he imparted to his godfather his
observation the old man said

How then Business is just the same as wara hazardous affair There
they fight for the purse and in the purse is the soul

I dont like this announced Foma

Neither do I like everythingtheres too much fraud

But to be fair in business matters is utterly impossible you must be
shrewd In business dear on approaching a man you must hold honey in
your left hand and clutch a knife in your right Everybody would like
to buy five copecks worth for a half a copeck

Well this isnt too good said Foma thoughtfully But it will be
good later When you have taken the upper hand then it will be good
Life dear Foma is very simple either bite everybody or lie in the
gutter

The old man smiled and the broken teeth in his mouth roused in Foma the
keen thought

You have bitten many it seems

Theres but one wordbattle repeated the old man

Is this the real one asked Foma looking at Mayakin searchingly

That is what do you meanthe real

Is there nothing better than this Does this contain everything

Where else should it be Everybody lives for himself Each of us wishes
the best for himself And what is the best To go in front of others to
stand above them So that everybody is trying to attain the first place
in lifeone by this means another by that means But everyone is
positively anxious to be seen from afar like a tower And man was
indeed appointed to go upward Even the Book of Job says Man is born
unto trouble as the sparks to fly upward Just see even children at
play always wish to surpass one another And each and every game has its
climax which makes it interesting Do you understand

I understand this said Foma firmly and confidently

But you must also feel this With understanding alone you cannot go
far and you must desire and desire so that a big mountain should seem
to you but a hillock and the sea but a puddle Eh When I was of your
age I had an easy life while you are only taking aim But then good
fruit does not ripen early

The old mans monotonous speeches soon accomplished what they were
intended to do Foma listened to them and made clear to himself the aim
of life He must be better than others he resolved and the ambition
kindled by the old man took deep root in his heart It took root
within his heart but did not fill it up for Fomas relations toward
Medinskaya assumed that character which they were bound to assume He
longed for her he always yearned to see her while in her presence
he became timid awkward and stupid he knew it and suffered on this
account He frequently visited her but it was hard to find her at home
alone perfumed dandies like flies over a piece of sugarwere always
flitting about her They spoke to her in French sang and laughed while
he looked at them in silence tortured by anger and jealousy His
legs crossed he sat somewhere in a corner of her richly furnished
drawingroom where it was extremely difficult to walk without
overturning or at least striking against somethingFoma sat and watched
them sternly

Over the soft rugs she was noiselessly passing hither and thither
casting to him kind glances and smiles while her admirers were fawning
upon her and they all like serpents were cleverly gliding by the
various little tables chairs screens flowerstandsa storehouse
full of beautiful and frail things scattered about the room with a
carelessness equally dangerous to them and to Foma But when he walked
there the rugs did not drown his footsteps and all these things caught
at his coat trembled and fell Beside the piano stood a sailor made of
bronze whose hand was lifted ready to throw the lifesaving ring on
this ring were ropes of wire and these always pulled Foma by the hair
All this provoked laughter among Sophya Pavlovna and her admirers and
Foma suffered greatly changing from heat to cold

But he felt no less uncomfortable even when alone with her Greeting him
with a kindly smile she would take a seat beside him in one of the cosy
corners of her drawingroom and would usually start her conversation by
complaining to him of everybody

You wouldnt believe how glad I am to see you Bending like a cat
she would gaze into his eyes with her dark glance in which something
avidious would now flash up

I love to speak to you she said musically drawling her words Ive
grown tired of all the rest of them Theyre all so boring ordinary
and wornout while you are fresh sincere You dont like those people
either do you

I cant bear them replied Foma firmly

And me she asked softly

Foma turned his eyes away from her and said with a sigh

How many times have you asked me that

Is it hard for you to tell me

It isnt hard but what for

I must know it

You are making sport of me said Foma sternly And she opened her
eyes wide and inquired in a tone of great astonishment

How do I make sport of you What does it mean to make sport

And her face looked so angelic that he could not help believing her

I love you I love you It is impossible not to love you said he
hotly and immediately added sadly lowering his voice But you dont
need it

There you have it sighed Medinskaya satisfied drawing back from
him I am always extremely pleased to hear you say this with so much
youthfulness and originality Would you like to kiss my hand

Without saying a word he seized her thin white little hand and
carefully bending down to it he passionately kissed it for a long time
Smiling and graceful not in the least moved by his passion she freed
her hand from his Pensively she looked at him with that strange
glitter in her eyes which always confused Foma she examined him as
something rare and extremely curious and said

How much strength and power and freshness of soul you possess Do you
know You merchants are an altogether new race an entire race with
original traditions with an enormous energy of body and soul Take you
for instanceyou are a precious stone and you should be polished Oh

Whenever she told him You or according to your merchant fashion
it seemed to Foma that she was pushing him away from her with these
words This at once saddened and offended him He was silent looking
at her small maidenly figure which was always somehow particularly well
dressed always sweetscented like a flower Sometimes he was seized
with a wild coarse desire to embrace and kiss her But her beauty
and the fragility of her thin supple body awakened in him a fear of
breaking and disfiguring her and her calm caressing voice and the
clear but somewhat cautious look of her eyes chilled his passion
it seemed to him as though she were looking straight into his soul
divining all his thoughts But these bursts of emotion were rare
Generally the youth regarded Medinskaya with adoration admiring
everything in herher beauty her words her dresses And beside
this adoration there was in him a painfully keen consciousness of his
remoteness from her of her supremacy over him

These relations were established between them within a short time after
two or three meetings Medinskaya was in full possession of the youth and
she slowly began to torture him Evidently she liked to have a healthy
strong youth at her mercy she liked to rouse and tame the animal in
him merely with her voice and glance and confident of the power of her
superiority she found pleasure in thus playing with him On leaving
her he was usually halfsick from excitement bearing her a grudge
angry with himself filled with many painful and intoxicating
sensations And about two days later he would come to undergo the same
torture again

One day he asked her timidly

Sophya Pavlovna Have you ever had any children

No

I thought not exclaimed Foma with delight

She cast at him the look of a very naive little girl and said

What made you think so And why do you want to know whether I had any
children or not

Foma blushed and bending his head began to speak to her in a heavy
voice as though he was lifting every word from the ground and as though
each word weighed a few puds

You seea woman whohas given birth to childrensuch a woman has
altogether different eyes

So What kind are they then

Shameless Foma blurted out

Medinskaya broke into her silver laughter and Foma looking at her
also began to laugh

Excuse me said he at length Perhaps Ive said something wrong
improper

Oh no no You cannot say anything improper You are a pure amiable
boy And so my eyes are not shameless

Yours are like an angels announced Foma with enthusiasm looking
at her with beaming eyes And she glanced at him as she had never done
before her look was that of a mother a sad look of love mingled with
fear for the beloved

Go dear one I am tired I need a rest she said to him as she rose
without looking at him He went away submissively

For some time after this incident her attitude toward him was stricter
and more sincere as though she pitied him but later their relations
assumed the old form of the catandmouse play

Fomas relation toward Medinskaya could not escape his godfathers
notice and one day the old man asked him with a malicious grimace

Foma You had better feel your head more often so that you may not lose
it by accident

What do you mean asked Foma

I speak of Sonka You are going to see her too often

What has that to do with you said Foma rather rudely And why do
you call her Sonka

Its nothing to me I would lose nothing if you should be fleeced
And as to calling her Sonkaeverybody knows that is her name So does
everybody know that she likes to rake up the fire with other peoples
hands

She is clever announced Foma firmly frowning and hiding his hands
in his pockets She is intelligent

Clever thats true How cleverly she arranged that entertainment
there was an income of two thousand four hundred roubles the
expensesone thousand nine hundred the expenses really did not even
amount to a thousand roubles for everybody does everything for her for
nothing Intelligent She will educate you and especially will those
idlers that run around her

Theyre not idlers they are clever people replied Foma angrily
contradicting himself now And I learn from them What am I I know
nothing What was I taught While there they speak of everythingand
each one has his word to say Do not hinder me from being like a man

Pooh How youve learned to speak With so much anger like the hail
striking against the roof Very well be like a man but in order to be
like a man it might be less dangerous for you to go to the tavern the
people there are after all better than Sophyas people And you young
man you should have learned to discriminate one person from another
Take Sophya for instance What does she represent An insect for the
adornment of nature and nothing more

Intensely agitated Foma set his teeth together and walked away from
Mayakin thrusting his hands still deeper into his pockets But the old
man soon started again a conversation about Medinskaya

They were on their way back from the bay after an inspection of
the steamers and seated in a big and commodious sledge they were
enthusiastically discussing business matters in a friendly way It was
in March The water under the sledgerunners was bubbling the snow was
already covered with a rather dirty fleece and the sun shone warmly and
merrily in the clear sky

Will you go to your lady as soon as we arrive asked Mayakin
unexpectedly interrupting their business talk

I will said Foma shortly and with displeasure

Mm Tell me how often do you give her presents asked Mayakin
plainly and somewhat intimately

What presents What for Foma wondered

You make her no presents You dont say Does she live with you then
merely so for loves sake

Foma boiled up with anger and shame turned abruptly toward the old man
and said reproachfully

Eh You are an old man and yet you speak so that it is a shame to
listen to you To say such a thing Do you think she would come down to
this

Mayakin smacked his lips and sang out in a mournful voice

What a blockhead you are What a fool and suddenly grown angry he
spat out Shame upon you All sorts of brutes drank out of the pot
nothing but the dregs remained and now a fool has made a god unto
himself of this dirty pot Devil You just go up to her and tell her
plainly I want to be your lover I am a young man dont charge me
much for it

Godfather said Foma sternly in a threatening voice I cannot bear
to hear such words If it were someone else

But who except myself would caution you Good God Mayakin cried out
clasping his hands So she has led you by the nose all winter long
What a nose What a beast she is

The old man was agitated in his voice rang vexation anger even tears
Foma had never before seen him in such a state and looking at him he
was involuntarily silent

She will ruin you Oh Lord The Babylonian prostitute

Mayakins eyes were blinking his lips were trembling and in rude
cynical words he began to speak of Medinskaya irritated with a
wrathful jar in his voice

Foma felt that the old man spoke the truth He now began to breathe with
difficulty and he felt that his mouth had a dry bitter taste

Very well father enough he begged softly and sadly turning aside
from Mayakin

Eh you ought to get married as soon as possible exclaimed the old
man with alarm

For Christs sake do not speak uttered Foma in a dull voice

Mayakin glanced at his godson and became silent Fomas face looked
drawn he grew pale and there was a great deal of painful bitter
stupor in his halfopen lips and in his sad look On the right and on
the left of the road a field stretched itself covered here and there
with patches of winterraiment Rooks were hopping busily about over
the black spots where the snow had melted The water under the
sledgerunners was splashing the muddy snow was kicked up by the hoofs
of the horses

How foolish man is in his youth exclaimed Mayakin in a low voice
Foma did not look at him

Before him stands the stump of a tree and yet he sees the snout of a
beastthats how he frightens himself Oh oh

Speak more plainly said Foma sternly

What is there to say The thing is clear girls are cream women are
milk women are near girls are far Consequently go to Sonka if
you cannot do without it and tell her plainly Thats how the matter
stands Fool If she is a sinner you can get her more easily Why are
you so angry then Why so bristled up

You dont understand said Foma in a low voice

What is it I do not understand I understand everything

The heart Man has a heart sighed the youth

Mayakin winked his eyes and said

Then he has no mind



CHAPTER VI

WHEN Foma arrived in the city he was seized with sad revengeful anger
He was burning with a passionate desire to insult Medinskaya to abuse
her His teeth firmly set together his hands thrust deep into his
pockets he walked for a few hours in succession about the deserted
rooms of his house he sternly knitted his brow and constantly threw
his chest forward His breast was too narrow to hold his heart which
was filled with wrath He stamped the floor with heavy and measured
steps as though he were forging his anger

The vile wretchdisguised herself as an angel Pelageya vividly arose
in his memory and he whispered malignantly and bitterly

Though a fallen woman she is better She did not play the hypocrite
She at once unfolded her soul and her body and her heart is surely just
as her breastwhite and sound

Sometimes Hope would whisper timidly in his ear

Perhaps all that was said of her was a lie

But he recalled the eager certainty of his godfather and the power
of his words and this thought perished He set his teeth more firmly
together and threw his chest still more forward Evil thoughts like
splinters of wood stuck into his heart and his heart was shattered by
the acute pain they caused

By disparaging Medinskaya Mayakin made her more accessible to his
godson and Foma soon understood this A few days passed and Fomas
agitated feelings became calm absorbed by the spring business cares
The sorrow for the loss of the individual deadened the spite he owed
the woman and the thought of the womans accessibility increased his
passion for her And somehow without perceiving it himself he suddenly
understood and resolved that he ought to go up to Sophya Pavlovna and
tell her plainly openly just what he wanted of herthats all He
even felt a certain joy at this resolution and he boldly started off to
Medinskaya thinking on the way only how to tell her best all that was
necessary

The servants of Medinskaya were accustomed to his visits and to his
question whether the lady was at home the maid replied

Please go into the drawingroom She is there alone

He became somewhat frightened but noticing in the mirror his stately
figure neatly clad with a frockcoat and his swarthy serious face in
a frame of a downy black beard set with large dark eyeshe raised his
shoulders and confidently stepped forward through the parlour Strange
sounds of a string instrument were calmly floating to meet him
they seemed to burst into quiet cheerless laughter complaining of
something tenderly stirring the heart as though imploring it for
attention and having no hopes of getting it Foma did not like to hear
musicit always filled him with sadness Even when the machine in the
tavern played some sad tune his heart filled with melancholy anguish
and he would either ask them to stop the machine or would go away some
little distance feeling that he could not listen calmly to these
tunes without words but full of lamentation and tears And now he
involuntarily stopped short at the door of the drawingroom

A curtain of long strings of particoloured glass beads hung over the
door The beads had been strung so as to form a fantastic figure of some
kind of plants the strings were quietly shaking and it seemed that pale
shadows of flowers were soaring in the air This transparent curtain did
not hide the inside of the drawingroom from Fomas eyes Seated on a
couch in her favourite corner Medinskaya played the mandolin A large
Japanese umbrella fastened up to the wall shaded the little woman
in black by its mixture of colours the high bronze lamp under a red
lampshade cast on her the light of sunset The mild sounds of the
slender strings were trembling sadly in the narrow room which was
filled with soft and fragrant twilight Now the woman lowered the
mandolin on her knees and began running her fingers over the strings
also to examine fixedly something before her Foma heaved a sigh

A soft sound of music soared about Medinskaya and her face was forever
changing as though shadows were falling on it falling and melting away
under the flash of her eyes

Foma looked at her and saw that when alone she was not quite so
goodlooking as in the presence of peoplenow her face looked
older more seriousher eyes had not the expression of kindness and
gentleness they had a rather tired and weary look And her pose
too was weary as if the woman were about to stir but could not Foma
noticed that the feeling which prompted him to come to her was now
changing in his heart into some other feeling He scraped with his foot
along the floor and coughed

Who is that asked the woman starting with alarm And the strings
trembled issuing an alarmed sound

It is I said Foma pushing aside the strings of the beads

Ah But how quietly youve entered I am glad to see you Be seated
Why didnt you come for such a long time

Holding out her hand to him she pointed with the other at a small
armchair beside her and her eyes were gaily smiling

I was out on the bay inspecting my steamers said Foma with
exaggerated ease moving his armchair nearer to the couch

Is there much snow yet on the fields

As much as one may want But it is already melting considerably There
is water on the roads everywhere

He looked at her and smiled Evidently Medinskaya noticed the ease of
his behaviour and something new in his smile for she adjusted her dress
and drew farther away from him Their eyes metand Medinskaya lowered
her head

Melting said she thoughtfully examining the ring on her little
finger

Yees streams everywhere Foma informed her admiring his boots

Thats good Spring is coming

Now it wont be delayed long

Spring is coming repeated Medinskaya softly as if listening to the
sounds of her words

People will start to fall in love said Foma with a smile and for
some reason or other firmly rubbed his hands

Are you preparing yourself asked Medinskaya drily

I have no need for it I have been ready long ago I am already in love
for all my life

She cast a glance at him and started to play again looking at the
strings and saying pensively

Spring How good it is that you are but beginning to live The heart is
full of power and there is nothing dark in it

Sophya Pavlovna exclaimed Foma softly She interrupted him with a
caressing gesture

Wait dearest Today I can tell you something good Do you know a
person who has lived long has such moments that when he looks into his
heart he unexpectedly finds there something long forgotten For years it
lay somewhere in the depth of his heart but lost none of the fragrance
of youth and when memory touches it then spring comes over that
person breathing upon him the vivifying freshness of the morning of his
life This is good though it is very sad

The strings trembled and wept under the touch of her fingers and it
seemed to Foma that their sounds and the soft voice of the woman were
touching his heart gently and caressingly But still firm in his
decision he listened to her words and not knowing their meaning
thought

You may speak And I wont believe anything you may say

This thought irritated him And he felt sorry that he could not listen
to her words as attentively and trustfully as before

Are you thinking of how it is necessary to live asked the woman

Sometimes I think of it and then I forget again I have no time for
it said Foma and smiled And then what is there to think of It is
simple You see how others live Well consequently you must imitate
them

Ah dont do this Spare yourself You are so good There is something
peculiar in you whatI do not know But it can be felt And it seems
to me it will be very hard for you to get along in life I am sure you
will not go along the usual way of the people of your circle No You
cannot be pleased with a life which is wholly devoted to gain to hunts
after the rouble to this business of yours Oh no I know you will
have a desire for something else will you not

She spoke quickly with a look of alarm in her eyes Looking at her
Foma thought

What is she driving at

And he answered her slowly

Perhaps I will have a desire for something else Perhaps I have it
already

Drawing up closer to him she looked into his face and spoke
convincingly

Listen Do not live like all other people Arrange your life somehow
differently You are strong young You are good

And if I am good then there must be good for me exclaimed Foma
feeling that he was seized with agitation and that his heart was
beginning to beat with anxiety

Ah but that is not the case Here on earth it is worse for the good
people than for the bad ones said Medinskaya sadly

And again the trembling notes of music began to dance at the touch of
her fingers Foma felt that if he did not start to say at once what was
necessary he would tell her nothing later

God bless me he said to himself and in a lowered voice
strengthening his heart began

Sophya Pavlovna Enough I have something to say I have come to tell
you Enough We must deal fairly openly At first you have attracted
me to yourself and now you are fencing away from me I cannot
understand what you say My mind is dull but I can feel that you wish
to hide yourself I can see itdo you understand now what brought me
here

His eyes began to flash and with each word his voice became warmer and
louder She moved her body forward and said with alarm

Oh cease

No I wont I will speak

I know what you want to say

You dont know it all said Foma threateningly rising to his feet
But I know everything about youeverything

Yes Then the better it is for me said Medinskaya calmly

She also arose from the couch as though about to go away somewhere but
after a few seconds she again seated herself on the couch Her face was
serious her lips were tightly compressed but her eyes were lowered
and Foma could not see their expression He thought that when he told
her I know everything about you she would be frightened she would
feel ashamed and confused would ask his forgiveness for having made
sport of him Then he would embrace her and forgive her But that was
not the case it was he who was confused by her calmness He looked at
her searching for words to resume his speech but found them not

It is better she repeated firmly and drily So you have learned
everything have you And of course youve censured me as I deserve
I understand I am guilty before you But no I cannot justify myself

She became silent and suddenly lifting her hands with a nervous
gesture clasped her head and began to adjust her hair

Foma heaved a deep sigh Her words had killed in him a certain hopea
hope whose presence in his heart he only felt now that it was dead And
shaking his head he said with bitter reproach

There was a time when I looked at you and thought How beautiful she
is how good the dove And now you say yourself I am guilty Ah

The voice of the youth broke down And the woman began to laugh softly

How fine and how ridiculous you are and what a pity that you cannot
understand all this

The youth looked at her feeling himself disarmed by her caressing words
and melancholy smile That cold harsh something which he had in his
heart against her was now melting before the warm light of her eyes
The woman now seemed to him small defenseless like a child She was
saying something in a gentle voice as though imploring and forever
smiling but he paid no attention to her words

Ive come to you said he interrupting her words without pity I
meant to tell you everything And yet I said nothing I dont feel like
doing it My heart sank You are breathing upon me so strangely Eh I
should not have seen you What are you to me It would be better for me
to go away it seems

Wait dearest dont go away said the woman hastily holding out her
hand to him Why so severe Do not be angry at me What am I to
you You need a different friend a woman just as simpleminded and
soundsouled as you are She must be gay healthy II am already an
old woman I am forever worrying My life is so empty and so weary so
empty Do you know when a person has grown accustomed to live merrily
and then cannot be merry he feels bad He desires to live cheerfully
he desires to laugh yet he does not laughit is life that is laughing
at him And as to men Listen Like a mother I advise you I beg and
implore youobey no one except your own heart Live in accordance with
its promptings Men know nothing they cannot tell you anything that is
true Do not heed them

Trying to speak as plainly and intelligibly as possible she was
agitated and her words came incoherently hurriedly one after another
A pitiful smile played on her lips all the time and her face was not
beautiful

Life is very strict It wants all people to submit to its requests
and only the very strong ones can resist it with impunity It is yet
questionable whether they can do it Oh if you knew how hard it is to
live Man goes so far that he begins to fear his own self He is split
into judge and criminalhe judges his own self and seeks justification
before himself And he is willing to pass days and nights with those
that despise him and that are repulsive to himjust to avoid being
alone with himself

Foma lifted his head and said distrustfully with surprise

I cannot understand what it is Lubov also says the same

Which Lubov What does she say

My fostersister She says the sameshe is forever complaining of
life It is impossible to live she says

Oh she is yet young And it is a great happiness that she already
speaks of this

Happiness Foma drawled out mockingly It must be a fine happiness
that makes people sigh and complain

Youd better listen to complaints There is always much wisdom in these
complaints of men Oh There is more wisdom in these complaints than
anywhere else You listen to thesethey will teach you to find your
way

Foma heard the womans voice which sounded convincing and perplexed
looked about him Everything had long been familiar to him but today it
looked somewhat new to him A mass of trifles filled the room all
the walls were covered with pictures and shelves bright and beautiful
objects were staring from every corner The reddish light of the lamp
filled one with melancholy Twilight wrapped everything in the room and
only here and there the gold of the frames or the white spots of marble
flashed dimly Heavy fabrics were motionlessly hanging before the doors
All this embarrassed and almost choked Foma he felt as though he had
lost his way He was sorry for the woman But she also irritated him

Do you hear how I speak to you I wish I were your mother or your
sister Never before did anybody awaken in me so warm and kindred a
feeling as you have done And you you look at me in such an unfriendly
way Do you believe me Yes No

He looked at her and said with a sigh

I dont know I used to believe you

And now she asked hastily

And nowit is best for me to go I dont understand anything and yet
I long to understand I do not even understand myself On my way to you
I knew what to say and here all is confused You have put me up on the
rack you have set me on edge And then you tell meI am as a mother
to youwhich meansbegone

Understand me I feel sorry for you the woman exclaimed softly

Fomas irritation against her was growing stronger and stronger and as
he went on speaking to her his words became absurd While he spoke he
kept on moving his shoulders as though tearing something that entangled
him

Sorry What for I do not need it Eh I cannot speak well It is
bad to be dumb ButI would have told you You did not treat me
properlyindeed why have you so enticed a man Am I a plaything for
you

I only wanted to see you by my side said the woman simply in a
guilty voice

He did not hear these words

And when it came to the point you were frightened and you shut
yourself off from me You began to repent Ha ha Life is bad And why
are you always complaining of some life What life Man is life and
except man there is no life You have invented some other monster You
have done this to deceive the eye to justify yourself You do some
mischief you lose yourself in different inventions and foolishnesses
and then you sigh Ah life Oh life And have you not done it
yourself And covering yourself with complaints you confuse others You
have lost your way very well but why do you want to lead me astray Is
it wickedness that speaks in you I feel bad you say let him also
feel badthere Ill besprinkle his heart with my poisonous tears
Isnt that so Eh God has given you the beauty of an angel but your
heartwhere is it

Standing before her he trembled in every limb and examined her from
head to foot with reproachful looks Now his words came freely from his
heart he spoke not loud but with power and pleasure Her head raised
the woman stared into his face with wideopen eyes Her lips were
trembling and deep wrinkles appeared at the corners of her mouth

A beautiful person should lead a good life While of you they say
things Fomas voice broke down he raised his hand and concluded in a
dull voice

Goodbye

Goodbye said Medinskaya softly

He did not give her his hand but turning abruptly he walked away from
her But already at the door he felt that he was sorry for her and
he glanced at her across his shoulder There in the corner she stood
alone her head bent her hands hanging motionless

Understanding that he could not leave her thus he became confused and
said softly but without repenting

Perhaps I said something offensiveforgive me For after all I love
you and he heaved a deep sigh

The woman burst into soft nervous laughter

No you have not offended me God speed you

Well then goodbye repeated Foma in a still lower voice

Yes replied the woman also in a low voice

Foma pushed aside the strings of beads with his hand they swung back
noisily and touched his cheeks He shuddered at this cold touch and went
out carrying away a heavy perplexed feeling in his breast with his
heart beating as though a soft but strong net were cast over it

It was night by this time the moon was shining and the frost covered
the puddles with coatings of dull silver Foma walked along the
sidewalk he broke these with his cane and they cracked mournfully The
shadows of the houses fell on the road in black squares and the shadows
of the treesin wonderful patterns And some of them looked like thin
hands helplessly clutching the ground

What is she doing now thought Foma picturing to himself the woman
alone in the corner of a narrow room in the reddish halflight

It is best for me to forget her he decided But he could not forget
her she stood before him provoking in him now intense pity now
irritation and even anger And her image was so clear and the thoughts
of her were so painful as though he was carrying this woman in his
breast A cab was coming from the opposite side filling the silence of
the night with the jarring of the wheels on the cobblestones and with
their creaking on the ice When the cab was passing across a moonlit
strip the noise was louder and more brisk and in the shadows it was
heavier and duller The driver and the passenger in it were shaking
and hopping about for some reason or other they both bent forward
and together with the horse formed one big black mass The street was
speckled with spots of light and shade but in the distance the darkness
seemed thick as though the street were fenced off by a wall rising from
earth to the skies Somehow it occurred to Foma that these people did
not know whither they were going And he too did not know whither he
was going His house rose before his imaginationsix big rooms where
he lived alone Aunt Anfisa had gone to the cloister perhaps never to
returnshe might die there At home were Ivan the old deaf dvornik
the old maid Sekleteya his cook and servant and a black shaggy dog
with a snout as blunt as that of a sheatfish And the dog too was
old

Perhaps I really ought to get married thought Foma with a sigh

But the very thought of how easy it was for him to get married made him
ill at ease and even ridiculous in his own eyes It were but necessary
to ask his godfather tomorrow for a brideand before a month would
pass a woman would live with him in his house And she would be near
him day and night He would say to her Lets go for a walk and she
would go He would tell her Lets go to sleep and again she would
go Should she desire to kiss him she would kiss him even though he
did not like it And if he should tell her Go away I dont want it
she would feel offended What would he speak to her about What would
she tell him He thought and pictured to himself young ladies of his
acquaintance daughters of merchants Some of them were very pretty and
he knew that any one of them would marry him willingly But he did not
care to have any of them as his wife How awkward and shameful it must
be when a girl becomes a wife And what does the newlymarried couple
say to each other after the wedding in the bedroom Foma tried to
think what he would say in such a case and confused he began to laugh
finding no appropriate words Then he recalled Luba Mayakin She would
surely be first to say something uttering some unintelligible words
which were foreign to herself Somehow it seemed to him that all her
words were foreign and she did not speak as was proper for a girl of
her age appearance and descent

And here his thoughts rested on Lubovs complaints His gait became
slower he was now astounded by the fact that all the people that were
near to him and with whom he talked a great deal always spoke to him of
life His father his aunt his godfather Lubov Sophya Pavlovna all
these either taught him to understand life or complained of it He
recalled the words said by the old man on the steamer about Fate and
many other remarks on life reproaches and bitter complaints against it
which he happened to hear from all sorts of people

What does it mean he thought what is life if it is not man And
man always speaks as if life were something else something outside
of man and that something hinders him from living Perhaps it is the
devil

A painful feeling of fear fell on the youth he shuddered and hastily
looked around The street was deserted and quiet the dark windows of
the houses stared dimly into the dark of night and along the walls and
fences Fomas shadow followed him

Driver he cried out aloud quickening his steps The shadow started
and crawled after him frightened black silent It seemed to Foma that
there was a cold breath behind him and that something huge invisible
and terrible was overtaking him Frightened he almost ran to meet
the cab which appeared noisily from the darkness and when he seated
himself in the cab he dared not look back though he wished to do so



CHAPTER VII

ABOUT a week passed since Foma spoke to Medinskaya And her image
stood fixedly before Foma by night and by day awakening in his heart
a gnawing feeling of anxiety He longed to go to her and was so much
afflicted over her that even his bones were aching from the desire of
his heart to be near her again But he was sternly silent he frowned
and did not care to yield to this desire industriously occupying
himself with his affairs and provoking in himself a feeling of anger
against the woman He felt that if he went up to her he would no longer
find her to be the same as he had left her something must have changed
within her after that conversation and she would no longer receive him
as cordially as before would not smile at him the clear smile that used
to awaken in him strange thoughts and hopes Fearing that all this was
lost and that something else must have taken its place he restrained
himself and suffered

His work and his longing for the woman did not hinder him from thinking
of life He did not philosophize about this enigma which was already
stirring a feeling of alarm in his heart he was not able to argue but
he began to listen attentively to everything that men said of life and
he tried to remember their words They did not make anything clear to
him nay they increased his perplexity and prompted him to regard them
suspiciously They were clever cunning and sensiblehe saw it in
dealings with them it was always necessary to be on ones guard he knew
already that in important matters none of them spoke as they thought
And watching them carefully he felt that their sighs and their
complaints of life awakened in him distrust Silently he looked at
everybody with suspicion and a thin wrinkle masked his forehead

One morning his godfather said to him on the Exchange

Anany has arrived He would like to see you Go up to him toward
evening and see that you hold your tongue Anany will try to loosen it
in order to make you talk on business matters He is cunning the
old devil he is a holy fox hell lift his eyes toward heaven and
meanwhile will put his paw into your pocket and grab your purse Be on
your guard

Do we owe him anything asked Foma

Of course We havent paid yet for the barge and then fifty
fivefathom beams were taken from him not long ago If he wants
everything at oncedont give A rouble is a sticky thing the longer
it turns about in your hand the more copecks will stick to it A
rouble is like a good pigeonit goes up in the air you turn around and
seeit has brought a whole flock with it into the pigeonhouse

But how can we help paying it now if he demands it

Let him cry and ask for itand you roarbut dont give it to him

Ill go up there soon

Anany Savvich Shchurov was a rich lumberdealer had a big sawmill
built barges and ran rafts He had had dealings with Ignat and Foma had
more than once seen this tall heavilybearded longarmed whitehaired
old man who kept himself as erect as a pinetree His big handsome
figure his open face and his clear eyes called forth in Foma a feeling
of respect for Shchurov although he heard it rumoured that this
lumberdealer had gained his wealth not by honest toil and that he
was leading an evil life at home in an obscure village of the forest
district and Ignat had told Foma that when Shchurov was young and was
but a poor peasant he sheltered a convict in the bathhouse in his
garden and that there the convict made counterfeit money for him Since
that time Anany began to grow rich One day his bathhouse burned down
and in the ashes they discovered the corpse of a man with a fractured
skull There was a rumour in the village that Shchurov himself had
killed his workmankilled and then burned him Such things had happened
more than once with the goodlooking old man but similar rumours were
on foot with reference to many a rich man in townthey had all it
was said hoarded up their millions by way of robberies murders and
mainly by passing counterfeit money Foma had heard such stories in his
childhood and he never before considered whether they were true or not

He also knew that Shchurov had got rid of two wivesone of them died
during the first night of the wedding in Ananys embraces Then he took
his sons wife away from him and his son took to drink for grief and
would have perished in drunkenness had he not come to himself in time
and gone off to save himself in a hermitage in Irgiz And when his
mistressdaughterinlaw had passed away Shchurov took into his house
a dumb beggargirl who was living with him to this day and who had
recently borne him a dead child On his way to the hotel where Anany
stayed Foma involuntarily recalled all this and felt that Shchurov had
become strangely interesting to him

When Foma opened the door and stopped respectfully on the threshold
of the small room whose only window overlooked the rusty roof of the
neighbouring house he noticed that the old Shchurov had just risen from
sleep and sitting on his bed leaning his hands against it he stared
at the ground and he was so bent that his long white beard fell over
his knees But even bent he was large

Who entered asked Anany in a hoarse and angry voice without lifting
his head

I How do you do Anany Savvich

The old man raised his head slowly and winking his large eyes looked
at Foma

Ignats son is that right

The same

Well come over here sit down by the window Let me see how youve
grown up Will you not have a glass of tea with me

I wouldnt mind

Waiter cried the old man expanding his chest and taking his beard
in his hand he began to examine Foma in silence Foma also looked at
him stealthily

The old mans lofty forehead was all covered with wrinkles and its skin
was dark Gray curly locks covered his temples and his sharppointed
ears his calm blue eyes lent the upper part of his face a wise and good
expression But his cheeks and his lips were thick and red and seemed
out of place on his face His thin long nose was turned downward as
though it wished to hide itself in his white moustache the old man
moved his lips and from beneath them small yellow teeth were gleaming
He had on a pink calico shirt a silk belt around his waist and black
loose trousers which were tucked into his boots Foma stared at his
lips and thought that the old man was surely such as he was said to be

As a boy you looked more like your father said Shchurov suddenly and
sighed Then after a moments silence he asked Do you remember your
father Do you ever pray for him You must you must pray he went on
after he heard Fomas brief answer Ignat was a terrible sinner and he
died without repentance taken unawares He was a great sinner

He was not more sinful than others replied Foma angrily offended in
his fathers behalf

Than who for instance demanded Shchurov strictly

Are there not plenty of sinners

There is but one man on earth more sinful than was the late Ignatand
that is that cursed heathen your godfather Yashka ejaculated the old
man

Are you sure of it inquired Foma smiling

I Of course I am said Shchurov confidently nodding his head and
his eyes became somewhat darker I will also appear before the Lord
and that not sinless I shall bring with me a heavy burden before His
holy countenance I have been pleasing the devil myself only I trust to
God for His mercy while Yashka believes in nothing neither in dreams
nor in the singing of birds Yashka does not believe in God this I
know And for his nonbelief he will yet receive his punishment on
earth

Are you sure of this too

Yes I am And dont you think I also know that you consider it
ludicrous to listen to me What a sagacious fellow indeed But he who
has committed many sins is always wise Sin is a teacher Thats why
Yashka Mayakin is extraordinarily clever

Listening to the old mans hoarse and confident voice Foma thought

He is scenting death it seems

The waiter a small man with a face which was pale and characterless
brought in the samovar and quickly hastened out of the room with short
steps The old man was undoing some bundles on the windowsill and said
without looking at Foma

You are bold and the look of your eyes is dark Before there used to
be more lighteyed people because then the souls used to be brighter
Before everything was simplerboth the people and the sins and now
everything has become complicated Eh eh

He made tea seated himself opposite Foma and went on again

Your father at your age was a waterpumper and stayed with the fleet
near our village At your age Ignat was as clear to me as glass At a
single glance you could tell what sort of a man he was While youhere
I am looking at you but cannot see what you are Who are you You
dont know it yourself my lad and thats why youll suffer Everybody
nowadays must suffer because they do not know themselves Life is
a mass of windfallen trees and you must know how to find your
way through it Where is it All are going astray and the devil is
delighted Are you married

Not yet said Foma

There again you are not married and yet Im quite sure you are not
pure any longer Well are you working hard in your business

Sometimes Meanwhile I am with my godfather

What sort of work is it you have nowadays said the old man shaking
his head and his eyes were constantly twinkling now turning dark
now brightening up again You have no labour now In former years
the merchant travelled with horses on business Even at night in
snowstorms he used to go Murderers used to wait for him on the road
and kill him And he died a martyr washing his sins away with blood
Now they travel by rail they are sending telegrams or theyve even
invented something that a man may speak in his office and you can hear
him five miles away There the devil surely has a hand in it A man
sits without motion and commits sins merely because he feels lonesome
because he has nothing to do the machine does all his work He has
no work and without toil man is ruined He has provided himself with
machines and thinks it is good While the machine is the devils trap
for you He thus catches you in it While toiling you find no time for
sin but having a machineyou have freedom Freedom kills a man
even as the sunbeams kill the worm the dweller of the depth of earth
Freedom kills man

And pronouncing his words distinctly and positively the old
Anany struck the table four times with his finger His face beamed
triumphantly his chest rose high and over it the silver hair of his
beard shook noiselessly Dread fell on Foma as he looked at him and
listened to his words for there was a ring of firm faith in them
and it was the power of this faith that confused Foma He had already
forgotten all he knew about the old man all of which he had but a while
ago believed to be true

Whoever gives freedom to his body kills his soul said Anany looking
at Foma so strangely as if he saw behind him somebody who was grieved
and frightened by his words and whose fear and pain delighted him All
you people of today will perish through freedom The devil has captured
youhe has taken toil away from you and slipped machines and telegrams
into your hands How freedom eats into the souls of men Just tell me
why are the children worse than their fathers Because of their freedom
yes Thats why they drink and lead depraved lives with women They have
less strength because they have less work and they have not the spirit
of cheerfulness because they have no worries Cheerfulness comes in time
of rest while nowadays no one is getting tired

Well said Foma softly they were leading depraved lives and
drinking just as much in former days as now I suppose

Do you know it You should keep silence cried Anany flashing his
eyes sternly In former days man had more strength and the sins were
according to his strength While you of today have less strength
and more sins and your sins are more disgusting Then men were like
oaktrees And Gods judgment will also be in accordance with their
strength Their bodies will be weighed and angels will measure their
blood and the angels of God will see that the weight of the sins does
not exceed the weight of the body and the blood Do you understand God
will not condemn the wolf for devouring a sheep but if a miserable rat
should be guilty of the sheeps death God will condemn the rat

How can a man tell how God will judge man asked Foma thoughtfully
A visible trial is necessary

Why a visible trial

That people might understand

Who but the Lord is my judge

Foma glanced at the old man and lowering his head became silent
He again recalled the fugitive convict who was killed and burnt
by Shchurov and again he believed that it really was so And the
womenhis wives and his mistresseshad surely been hastened toward
their graves by this old mans caresses he had crushed them with his
bony chest drunk the sap of their life with these thick lips of his
which were scarlet yet from the clotted blood of the women who died in
the embraces of his long sinewy arms And now awaiting death which
was already somewhere beside him he counts his sins judges others and
perhaps judges himself and says

Who but the Lord is my judge

Is he afraid or not Foma asked himself and became pensive stealthily
scrutinising the old man

Yes my lad Think spoke Shchurov shaking his head think how you
are to live The capital in your heart is small and your habits are
great see that you are not reduced to bankruptcy before your own self
Hohoho

How can you tell what and how much I have within my heart said Foma
gloomily offended by his laughter

I can see it I know everything because I have lived long Ohhoho
How long I have lived Trees have grown up and been cut down and houses
built out of them and even the houses have grown old While I have seen
all this and am still alive and when at times I recall my life I
think Is it possible that one man could accomplish so much Is it
possible that I have witnessed all this The old man glanced at Foma
sternly shook his head and became silent

It became quiet Outside the window something was softly rustling on
the roof of the house the rattle of wheels and the muffled sounds of
conversation were heard from below from the street The samovar on the
table sang a sad tune Shchurov was fixedly staring into his glass of
tea stroking his beard and one could hear that something rattled in
his breast as if some burden was turning about in it

Its hard for you to live without your father isnt it said he

I am getting used to it replied Foma

You are rich and when Yakov dies you will be richer still Hell
leave everything to you

I dont need it

To whom else should he leave it He has but one daughter and you
ought to marry that daughter and that she is your godsister and
fostersisterno matter That can be arrangedand then you would be
married What good is there in the life you are now leading I suppose
you are forever running about with the girls

No

You dont say Eh eh eh the merchant is passing away A certain
forester told meI dont know whether he lied or notthat in former
days the dogs were wolves and then degenerated into dogs It is the
same with our calling we will soon also be dogs We will take up
science put stylish hats on our heads well do everything that is
necessary in order to lose our features and there will be nothing by
which to distinguish us from other people It has become a custom to
make Gymnasium students of all children The merchants the nobles the
commonersall are adjusted to match the same colour They dress them
in gray and teach them all the same subjects They grow man even as they
grow a tree Why do they do it No one knows Even a log could be told
from another by its knot at least while here they want to plane the
people over so that all of them should look alike The coffin is already
waiting for us old people Yees It may be that about fifty years
hence no one will believe that I lived in this world I Anany the son
of Savva by the surname of Shchurov So And that I Anany feared no
one save God And that in my youth I was a peasant that all the land I
possessed then was two desyatins and a quarter while toward my old age
I have hoarded up eleven thousand desyatins all forests and perhaps
two millions in cash

There they always speak of money said Foma with dissatisfaction
What joy does man derive from money Mm bellowed Shchurov You will
make a poor merchant if you do not understand the power of money

Who does understand it asked Foma

I said Shchurov with confidence And every clever man Yashka
understands it Money That is a great deal my lad Just spread it out
before you and think What does it contain Then will you know that
all this is human strength human mind Thousands of people have put
their life into your money and thousands more will do it And you can
throw it all into the fire and see how the money is burning and at that
moment you will consider yourself master

But nobody does this

Because fools have no money Money is invested in business Business
gives bread to the masses And you are master over all those masses
Wherefore did God create man That man should pray to Him He was
alone and He felt lonesome so He began to desire power and as man was
created in the image of the Lord man also desires power And what save
money can give power Thats the way Well and youhave you brought
me money

No answered Foma From the words of the old man Fomas head was heavy
and troubled and he was glad that the conversation had at last turned
to business matters

That isnt right said Shchurov sternly knitting his brow It is
overdueyou must pay

Youll get a half of it tomorrow

Why a half Why not all

We are badly in need of money now

And havent you any But I also need it

Wait a little

Eh my lad I will not wait You are not your father Youngsters like
you milksops are an unreliable lot In a month you may break up the
whole business And I would be the loser for it You give me all the
money tomorrow or Ill protest the notes It wouldnt take me long to
do it

Foma looked at Shchurov with astonishment It was not at all that same
old man who but a moment ago spoke so sagaciously about the devil Then
his face and his eyes seemed different and now he looked fierce his
lips smiled pitilessly and the veins on his cheeks near his nostrils
were eagerly trembling Foma saw that if he did not pay him at once
Shchurov would indeed not spare him and would dishonour the firm by
protesting the notes

Evidently business is poor grinned Shchurov Well tell the
truthwhere have you squandered your fathers money

Foma wanted to test the old man

Business is none too brisk said he with a frown We have no
contracts We have received no earnest money and so it is rather hard

Soo Shall I help you out

Be so kind Postpone the day of payment begged Foma modestly
lowering his eyes

Mm Shall I assist you out of my friendship for your father Well be
it so Ill do it

And for how long will you postpone it inquired Foma

For six months

I thank you humbly

Dont mention it You owe me eleven thousand six hundred roubles Now
listen rewrite the notes for the amount of fifteen thousand pay me the
interest on this sum in advance And as security Ill take a mortgage on
your two barges

Foma rose from the chair and said with a smile

Send me the notes tomorrow Ill pay you in full

Shchurov also rose from his chair and without lowering his eyes at
Fomas sarcastic look said calmly scratching his chest

Thats all right

Thank you for your kindness

Thats nothing You dont give me a chance or I would have shown you
my kindness said the old man lazily showing his teeth

Yes If one should fall into your hands

Hed find it warm

I am sure youd make it warm for him

Well my lad that will do said Shchurov sternly Though you
consider yourself quite clever it is rather too soon Youve gained
nothing and already you began to boast But you just win from methen
you may shout for joy Goodbye Have all the money for tomorrow

Dont let that trouble you Goodbye

God be with you

When Foma came out of the room he heard that the old man gave a slow
loud yawn and then began to hum in a rather hoarse bass

Open for us the doors of mercy Oh blessed Virgin Mary

Foma carried away with him from the old man a double feeling Shchurov
pleased him and at the same time was repulsive to him

He recalled the old mans words about sin thought of the power of
his faith in the mercy of the Lord and the old man aroused in Foma a
feeling akin to respect

He too speaks of life he knows his sins but does not weep over
them does not complain of them He has sinnedand he is willing to
stand the consequences Yes And she He recalled Medinskaya and his
heart contracted with pain

And she is repenting It is hard to tell whether she does it purposely
in order to hide from justice or whether her heart is really aching
Who but the Lord says he is to judge me Thats how it is

It seemed to Foma that he envied Anany and the youth hastened to recall
Shchurovs attempts to swindle him This called forth in him an aversion
for the old man He could not reconcile his feelings and perplexed he
smiled

Well I have just been at Shchurovs he said coming to Mayakin and
seating himself by the table

Mayakin in a greasy morninggown a countingboard in his hand began
to move about in his leathercovered armchair impatiently and said
with animation

Pour out some tea for him Lubava Tell me Foma I must be in the City
Council at nine oclock tell me all about it make haste

Smiling Foma related to him how Shchurov suggested to rewrite the
notes

Eh exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich regretfully with a shake of the
head Youve spoilt the whole mass for me dear How could you be so
straightforward in your dealings with the man Psha The devil drove me
to send you there I should have gone myself I would have turned him
around my finger

Hardly He says I am an oak

An oak And I am a saw An oak An oak is a good tree but its fruits
are good for swine only So it comes out that an oak is simply a
blockhead

But its all the same we have to pay anyway

Clever people are in no hurry about this while you are ready to run as
fast as you can to pay the money What a merchant you are

Yakov Tarasovich was positively dissatisfied with his godson He frowned
and in an angry manner ordered his daughter who was silently pouring
out tea

Push the sugar nearer to me Dont you see that I cant reach it

Lubovs face was pale her eyes seemed troubled and her hands moved
lazily and awkwardly Foma looked at her and thought

How meek she is in the presence of her father

What did he speak to you about asked Mayakin

About sins

Well of course His own affair is dearest to each and every man And
he is a manufacturer of sins Both in the galleys and in hell they have
long been weeping and longing for him waiting for him impatiently

He speaks with weight said Foma thoughtfully stirring his tea

Did he abuse me inquired Mayakin with a malicious grimace

Somewhat

And what did you do

I listened

Mm And what did you hear

The strong he says will be forgiven but there is no forgiveness
for the weak

Just think of it What wisdom Even the fleas know that

For some reason or another the contempt with which Mayakin regarded
Shchurov irritated Foma and looking into the old mans face he said
with a grin

But he doesnt like you

Nobody likes me my dear said Mayakin proudly There is no reason
why they should like me I am no girl But they respect me And they
respect only those they fear And the old man winked at his godson
boastfully

He speaks with weight repeated Foma He is complaining The real
merchant says he is passing away All people are taught the same
thing he says so that all may be equal looking alike

Does he consider it wrong

Evidently so

Foool Mayakin drawled out with contempt

Why Is it good asked Foma looking at his godfather suspiciously

We do not know what is good but we can see what is wise When we see
that all sorts of people are driven together in one place and are all
inspired there with one and the same ideathen must we acknowledge that
it is wise Becausewhat is a man in the empire Nothing more than
a simple brick and all bricks must be of the same size Do you
understand And those people that are of equal height and weightI can
place in any position I like

And whom does it please to be a brick said Foma morosely

It is not a question of pleasing it is a matter of fact If you are
made of hard material they cannot plane you It is not everybodys phiz
that you can rub off But some people when beaten with a hammer turn
into gold And if the head happens to crackwhat can you do It merely
shows it was weak

He also spoke about toil Everything he says is done by machinery
and thus are men spoiled

He is out of his wits Mayakin waved his hand disdainfully I am
surprised what an appetite you have for all sorts of nonsense What
does it come from

Isnt that true either asked Foma breaking into stern laughter

What true thing can he know A machine The old blockhead should have
thoughtwhat is the machine made of Of iron Consequently it need
not be pitied it is wound upand it forges roubles for you Without
any words without trouble you set it into motion and it revolves
While a man he is uneasy and wretched he is often very wretched He
wails grieves weeps begs Sometimes he gets drunk Ah how much there
is in him that is superfluous to me While a machine is like an arshin
yardstick it contains exactly so much as the work required Well I
am going to dress It is time

He rose and went away loudly scraping with his slippers along the
floor Foma glanced after him and said softly with a frown

The devil himself could not see through all this One says this the
other that

It is precisely the same with books said Lubov in a low voice

Foma looked at her smiling goodnaturedly And she answered him with a
vague smile

Her eyes looked fatigued and sad

You still keep on reading asked Foma

Yes the girl answered sadly

And are you still lonesome

I feel disgusted because I am alone Theres no one here to say a word
to

Thats bad

She said nothing to this but lowering her head she slowly began to
finger the fringes of the towel

You ought to get married said Foma feeling that he pitied her

Leave me alone please answered Lubov wrinkling her forehead

Why leave you alone You will get married I am sure

There exclaimed the girl softly with a sigh Thats just what I
am thinking ofit is necessary That is Ill have to get married But
how Do you know I feel now as though a mist stood between other people
and myselfa thick thick mist

Thats from your books Foma interposed confidently

Wait And I cease to understand what is going on about me Nothing
pleases me Everything has become strange to me Nothing is as it should
be Everything is wrong I see it I understand it yet I cannot say
that it is wrong and why it is so

It is not so not so muttered Foma Thats from your books Yes
Although I also feel that its wrong Perhaps that is because we are so
young and foolish

At first it seemed to me said Lubov not listening to him that
everything in the books was clear to me But now

Drop your books suggested Foma with contempt

Ah dont say that How can I drop them You know how many different
ideas there are in the world O Lord Theyre such ideas that set your
head afire According to a certain book everything that exists on earth
is rational

Everything asked Foma

Everything While another book says the contrary is true

Wait Now isnt this nonsense

What were you discussing asked Mayakin appearing at the door in a
long frockcoat and with several medals on his collar and his breast

Just so said Lubov morosely

We spoke about books added Foma

What kind of books

The books she is reading She read that everything on earth is
rational

Really

Well and I say it is a lie

Yes Yakov Tarasovich became thoughtful he pinched his beard and
winked his eyes a little

What kind of a book is it he asked his daughter after a pause

A little yellowcovered book said Lubov unwillingly

Just put that book on my table That is said not without
reflectioneverything on earth is rational See someone thought of it
Yes It is even very cleverly expressed And were it not for the fools
it might have been perfectly correct But as fools are always in the
wrong place it cannot be said that everything on earth is rational And
yet Ill look at the book Maybe there is common sense in it Goodbye
Foma Will you stay here or do you want to drive with me

Ill stay here a little longer

Very well

Lubov and Foma again remained alone

What a man your father is said Foma nodding his head toward the
direction of his godfather

Well what kind of a man do you think he is

He retorts every call and wants to cover everything with his words

Yes he is clever And yet he does not understand how painful my life
is said Lubov sadly

Neither do I understand it You imagine too much

What do I imagine cried the girl irritated

Why all these are not your own ideas They are someone elses

Someone elses Someone elses

She felt like saying something harsh but broke down and became silent
Foma looked at her and setting Medinskaya by her side thought sadly

How different everything isboth men and womenand you never feel
alike

They sat opposite each other both were lost in thought and neither one
looked at the other It was getting dark outside and in the room it
was quite dark already The wind was shaking the lindentrees and their
branches seemed to clutch at the walls of the house as though they felt
cold and implored for shelter in the rooms

Luba said Foma softly

She raised her head and looked at him

Do you know I have quarrelled with Medinskaya

Why asked Luba brightening up

So It came about that she offended me Yes she offended me

Well its good that youve quarrelled with her said the girl
approvingly for she would have turned your head She is a vile
creature she is a coquette even worse than that Oh what things I
know about her

Shes not at all a vile creature said Foma morosely And you dont
know anything about her You are all lying

Oh I beg your pardon

No See here Luba said Foma softly in a beseeching tone dont
speak ill of her in my presence It isnt necessary I know everything
By God She told me everything herself

Herself exclaimed Luba in astonishment What a strange woman she
is What did she tell you

That she is guilty Foma ejaculated with difficulty with a wry smile

Is that all There was a ring of disappointment in the girls
question Foma heard it and asked hopefully

Isnt that enough

What will you do now

Thats just what I am thinking about

Do you love her very much

Foma was silent He looked into the window and answered confusedly

I dont know But it seems to me that now I love her more than before

Than before the quarrel

Yes

I wonder how one can love such a woman said the girl shrugging her
shoulders

Love such a woman Of course Why not exclaimed Foma

I cant understand it I think you have become attached to her just
because you have not met a better woman

No I have not met a better one Foma assented and after a moments
silence said shyly Perhaps there is none better

Among our people Lubov interposed

I need her very badly Because you see I feel ashamed before her

Why so

Oh in general I fear her that is I would not want her to think ill
of me as of others Sometimes I feel disgusted I thinkwouldnt it
be a great idea to go out on such a spree that all my veins would start
tingling And then I recall her and I do not venture And so everything
else I think of her What if she finds it out and I am afraid to do
it

Yes the girl drawled out thoughtfully that shows that you love her
I would also be like this If I loved I would think of himof what he
might say

And everything about her is so peculiar Foma related softly She
speaks in a way all her own And God How beautiful she is And then
she is so small like a child

And what took place between you asked Lubov

Foma moved his chair closer to her and stooping he lowered his voice
for some reason or other and began to relate to her all that had taken
place between him and Medinskaya He spoke and as he recalled the words
he said to Medinskaya the sentiments that called forth the words were
also awakened in him

I told her Oh you why did you make sport of me he said angrily
and with reproach

And Luba her cheeks aflame with animation spurred him on nodding her
head approvingly

Thats it Thats good Well and she

She was silent said Foma sadly with a shrug of the shoulders That
is she said different things but whats the use

He waved his hand and became silent Luba playing with her braid was
also silent The samovar had already become cold And the dimness in the
room was growing thicker and thicker outside the window it was heavy
with darkness and the black branches of the lindentrees were shaking
pensively

You might light the lamp Foma went on

How unhappy we both are said Luba with a sigh

Foma did not like this

I am not unhappy he objected in a firm voice I am simplynot yet
accustomed to life

He who knows not what he is going to do tomorrow is unhappy said
Luba sadly I do not know it neither do you Whither go Yet go we
must Why is it that my heart is never at ease Some kind of a longing
is always quivering within it

It is the same with me said Foma I start to reflect but on what
I cannot make it clear to myself There is also a painful gnawing in my
heart Eh But I must go up to the club

Dont go away Luba entreated

I must Somebody is waiting there for me I am going Goodbye

Till we meet again She held out her hand to him and sadly looked into
his eyes

Will you go to sleep now asked Foma firmly shaking her hand

Ill read a little

Youre to your books as the drunkard to his whisky said the youth
with pity

What is there that is better

Walking along the street he looked at the windows of the house and in
one of them he noticed Lubas face It was just as vague as everything
that the girl told him even as vague as her longings Foma nodded his
head toward her and with a consciousness of his superiority over her
thought

She has also lost her way like the other one

At this recollection he shook his head as though he wanted to frighten
away the thought of Medinskaya and quickened his steps

Night was coming on and the air was fresh A cold invigorating wind
was violently raging in the street driving the dust along the sidewalks
and throwing it into the faces of the passersby It was dark and
people were hastily striding along in the darkness Foma wrinkled his
face for the dust filled his eyes and thought

If it is a woman I meet nowthen it will mean that Sophya Pavlovna
will receive me in a friendly way as before I am going to see her
tomorrow And if it is a manI wont go tomorrow Ill wait

But it was a dog that came to meet him and this irritated Foma to such
an extent that he felt like striking him with his cane

In the refreshmentroom of the club Foma was met by the jovial
Ookhtishchev He stood at the door and chatted with a certain stout
whiskered man but noticing Gordyeeff he came forward to meet him
saying with a smile

How do you do modest millionaire Foma rather liked him for his jolly
mood and was always pleased to meet him

Firmly and kindheartedly shaking Ookhtishchevs hand Foma asked him

And what makes you think that I am modest

What a question A man who lives like a hermit who neither
drinks nor plays nor likes any women By the way do you know Foma
Ignatyevich that peerless patroness of ours is going abroad tomorrow
for the whole summer

Sophya Pavlovna asked Foma slowly Of course The sun of my life is
setting And perhaps of yours as well

Ookhtishchev made a comical sly grimace and looked into Fomas face

And Foma stood before him feeling that his head was lowering on his
breast and that he was unable to hinder it

Yes the radiant Aurora

Is Medinskaya going away a deep bass voice asked Thats fine I am
glad

May I know why exclaimed Ookhtishchev Foma smiled sheepishly and
stared in confusion at the whiskered man Ookhtishchevs interlocutor

That man was stroking his moustache with an air of importance and deep
heavy repulsive words fell from his lips on Fomas ears

Because you see there will be one cocotte less in town

Shame Martin Nikitich said Ookhtishchev reproachfully knitting his
brow

How do you know that she is a coquette asked Foma sternly coming
closer to the whiskered man The man measured him with a scornful look
turned aside and moving his thigh drawled out

I didnt saycoquette

Martin Nikitich you mustnt speak that way about a woman who began
Ookhtishchev in a convincing tone but Foma interrupted him

Excuse me just a moment I wish to ask the gentleman what is the
meaning of the word he said

And as he articulated this firmly and calmly Foma thrust his hands deep
into his trouserspockets threw his chest forward which at once gave
his figure an attitude of defiance The whiskered gentleman again eyed
Foma with a sarcastic smile

Gentlemen exclaimed Ookhtishchev softly

I said cocotte pronounced the whiskered man moving his lips as if
he tasted the word And if you dont understand it I can explain it to
you

You had better explain it said Foma with a deep sigh not lifting
his eyes off the man

Ookhtishchev clasped his hands and rushed aside

A cocotte if you want to know it is a prostitute said the whiskered
man in a low voice moving his big fat face closer to Foma

Foma gave a soft growl and before the whiskered man had time to move
away he clutched with his right hand his curly grayish hair With a
convulsive movement of the hand Foma began to shake the mans head and
his big solid body lifting up his left hand he spoke in a dull voice
keeping time to the punishment

Dont abuse a personin his absence Abuse himright in his
facestraight in his eyes

He experienced a burning delight seeing how comically the stout arms
were swinging in the air and how the legs of the man whom he was
shaking were bending under him scraping against the floor His gold
watch fell out of the pocket and dangled on the chain over his round
paunch Intoxicated with his own strength and with the degradation of
the sedate man filled with the burning feeling of malignancy trembling
with the happiness of revenge Foma dragged him along the floor and in
a dull voice growled wickedly in wild joy In these moments he
experienced a great feelingthe feeling of emancipation from the
wearisome burden which had long oppressed his heart with grief and
morbidness He felt that he was seized by the waist and shoulders from
behind that someone seized his hand and bent it trying to break it
that someone was crushing his toes but he saw nothing following with
his bloodshot eyes the dark heavy mass moaning and wriggling in his
hand Finally they tore him away and downed him and as through a
reddish mist he noticed before him on the floor at his feet the man
he had thrashed Dishevelled he was moving his legs over the floor
attempting to rise two dark men were holding him by the arms his hands
were dangling in the air like broken wings and in a voice that was
choking with sobs he cried to Foma

You mustnt beat me You mustnt I have an

Order You rascal Oh rascal I have children

Everybody knows me Scoundrel Savage OOO You may expect a duel

And Ookhtishchev spoke loudly in Fomas ear

Come my dear boy for Gods sake

Wait Ill give him a kick in the face begged Foma But he was
dragged off There was a buzzing in his ears his heart beat fast but
he felt relieved and well At the entrance of the club he heaved a deep
sigh of relief and said to Ookhtishchev with a goodnatured smile

I gave him a sound drubbing didnt I

Listen exclaimed the gay secretary indignantly You must pardon me
but that was the act of a savage The devil take it I never witnessed
such a thing before

My dear man said Foma friendly did he not deserve the drubbing Is
he not a scoundrel How can he speak like that behind a persons back
No Let him go to her and tell it plainly to her alone

Excuse me The devil take you But it wasnt for her alone that you
gave him the drubbing

That is what do you meanot for her alone For whom then asked
Foma amazed

For whom I dont know Evidently you had old accounts to settle Oh
Lord That was a scene I shall not forget it in all my life

Hethat manwho is he asked Foma and suddenly burst out laughing
How he roared the fool

Ookhtishchev looked fixedly into his face and asked

Tell me is it true that you dont know whom youve thrashed And is
it really only for Sophya Pavlovna

It is by God avowed Foma

So the devil knows what the result may be He stopped short shrugged
his shoulders perplexedly waved his hand and again began to pace
the sidewalk looking at Foma askance Youll pay for this Foma
Ignatyevich

Will he take me to court

Would to God he does He is the ViceGovernors soninlaw

Is that so said Foma slowly and made a long face

Yes To tell the truth he is a scoundrel and a rascal According to
this fact I must admit that he deserves a drubbing But taking into
consideration the fact that the lady you defended is also

Sir said Foma firmly placing his hand on Ookhtishchevs shoulder
I have always liked you and you are now walking with me I understand
it and can appreciate it But do not speak ill of her in my presence
Whatever she may be in your opinion in my opinion she is dear to me
To me she is the best woman So I am telling you frankly Since you are
going with me do not touch her I consider her good therefore she is
good

There was great emotion in Fomas voice Ookhtishchev looked at him and
said thoughtfully

You are a queer man I must confess

I am a simple mana savage I have given him a thrashing and now I
feel jolly and as to the result let come what will

I am afraid that it will result in something bad Do you knowto be
frank in return for your franknessI also like you althoughMm It
is rather dangerous to be with you Such a knightly temper may come over
you and one may get a thrashing at your hands

How so This was but the first time I am not going to beat people
every day am I said Foma confused His companion began to laugh

What a monster you are Listen to meit is savage to fightyou must
excuse me but it is abominable Yet I must tell you in this case you
made a happy selection You have thrashed a rake a cynic a parasitea
man who robbed his nephews with impunity

Well thank God for that said Foma with satisfaction Now I have
punished him a little

A little Very well let us suppose it was a little But listen to me
my child permit me to give you advice I am a man of the law He that
Kayazev is a rascal True But you must not thrash even a rascal for
he is a social being under the paternal custody of the law You cannot
touch him until he transgresses the limits of the penal code But even
then not you but we the judges will give him his due While you must
have patience

And will he soon fall into your hands inquired Foma naively

It is hard to tell Being far from stupid he will probably never be
caught and to the end of his days he will live with you and me in the
same degree of equality before the law Oh God what I am telling you
said Ookhtishchev with a comical sigh

Betraying secrets grinned Foma

It isnt secrets but I ought not to be frivolous Deeevil But then
this affair enlivened me Indeed Nemesis is even then true to herself
when she simply kicks like a horse

Foma stopped suddenly as though he had met an obstacle on his way

Nemesisthe goddess of Justice babbled Ookhtishchev Whats the
matter with you

And it all came about said Foma slowly in a dull voice because
you said that she was going away

Who

Sophya Pavlovna

Yes she is going away Well

He stood opposite Foma and stared at him with a smile in his eyes
Gordyeeff was silent with lowered head tapping the stone of the
sidewalk with his cane

Come said Ookhtishchev

Foma started saying indifferently

Well let her go And I am alone Ookhtishchev waving his cane began
to whistle looking at his companion

Shant I be able to get along without her asked Foma looking
somewhere in front of him and then after a pause he answered himself
softly and irresolutely

Of course I shall

Listen to me exclaimed Ookhtishchev Ill give you some good advice
A man must be himself While you you are an epic man so to say and
the lyrical is not becoming to you It isnt your genre

Speak to me more simply sir said Foma having listened attentively
to his words

More simply Very well I want to say give up thinking of this little
lady She is poisonous food for you

She told me the same put in Foma gloomily

She told you Ookhtishchev asked and became thoughtful Now Ill
tell you shouldnt we perhaps go and have supper

Lets go Foma assented And he suddenly roared obdurately clinching
his fists and waving them in the air Well let us go and Ill get
wound up Ill break loose after all this so you cant hold me back

What for Well do it modestly

No wait said Foma anxiously seizing him by the shoulder Whats
that Am I worse than other people Everybody lives whirls hustles
about has his own point While I am weary Everybody is satisfied with
himself And as to their complaining they lie the rascals They are
simply pretending for beautys sake I have no reason to pretend I am
a fool I dont understand anything my dear fellow I simply wish to
live I am unable to think I feel disgusted one says this another
that Pshaw But she eh If you knew My hope was in her I expected of
herjust what I expected I cannot tell but she is the best of women
And I had so much faith in herwhen sometimes she spoke such peculiar
words all her own Her eyes my dear boy are so beautiful Oh Lord I
was ashamed to look upon them and as I am telling you she would say a
few words and everything would become clear to me For I did not come
to her with love aloneI came to her with all my soul I soughtI
thought that since she was so beautiful consequently I might become a
man by her side

Ookhtishchev listened to the painful unconnected words that burst from
his companions lips He saw how the muscles of his face contracted with
the effort to express his thoughts and he felt that behind this bombast
there was a great serious grief There was something intensely pathetic
in the powerlessness of this strong and savage youth who suddenly
started to pace the sidewalk with big uneven steps Skipping along
after him with his short legs Ookhtishchev felt it his duty somehow to
calm Foma Everything Foma had said and done that evening awakened in
the jolly secretary a feeling of lively curiosity toward Foma and
then he felt flattered by the frankness of the young millionaire This
frankness confused him with its dark power he was disconcerted by its
pressure and though in spite of his youth he had a stock of words
ready for all occasions in life it took him quite awhile to recall
them

I feel that everything is dark and narrow about me said Gordyeeff I
feel that a burden is falling on my shoulders but what it is I cannot
understand It puts a restraint on me and it checks the freedom of my
movements along the road of life Listening to people you hear that
each says a different thing But she could have said

Eh my dear boy Ookhtishchev interrupted Foma gently taking his arm
That isnt right You have just started to live and already you are
philosophizing No that is not right Life is given us to live Which
meanslive and let others live Thats the philosophy And that woman
Bah Is she then the only one in the world The world is large enough
If you wish Ill introduce you to such a virile woman that even the
slightest trace of your philosophy would at once vanish from your soul
Oh a remarkable woman And how well she knows how to avail herself
of life Do you know theres also something epic about her She is
beautiful a Phryne I may say and what a match she would be to you
Ah devil It is really a splendid idea Ill make you acquainted with
her We must drive one nail out with another

My conscience does not allow it said Foma sadly and sternly So
long as she is alive I cannot even look at women

Such a robust and healthy young man Ho ho exclaimed Ookhtishchev
and in the tone of a teacher began to argue with Foma that it was
essential for him to give his passion an outlet in a good spree in the
company of women

This will be magnificent and it is indispensable to you You may
believe me And as to conscience you must excuse me You dont define
it quite properly It is not conscience that interferes with you but
timidity I believe You live outside of society You are bashful
and awkward Youare dimly conscious of all this and it is this
consciousness that you mistake for conscience In this case there can be
no question about conscience What has conscience to do here since it
is natural for man to enjoy himself since it is his necessity and his
right

Foma walked on regulating his steps to those of his companion and
staring along the road which lay between two rows of buildings
resembled an enormous ditch and was filled with darkness It seemed
that there was no end to the road and that something dark inexhaustible
and suffocating was slowly flowing along it in the distance
Ookhtishchevs kind suasive voice rang monotonously in Fomas ears
and though he was not listening to his words he felt that they were
tenacious in their way that they adhered to him and that he was
involuntarily memorizing them Notwithstanding that a man walked beside
him he felt as though he were alone straying in the dark And the
darkness seized him and slowly drew him along and he felt that he was
drawn somewhere and yet had no desire to stop Some sort of fatigue
hindered his thinking there was no desire in him to resist the
admonitions of his companionand why should he resist them

It isnt for everyone to philosophize said Ookhtishchev swinging
his cane in the air and somewhat carried away by his wisdom For if
everybody were to philosophize who would live And we live but once
And therefore it were best to make haste to live By God Thats true
But whats the use of talking Would you permit me to give you a shaking
up Lets go immediately to a pleasurehouse I know Two sisters live
there Ah how they live You will come

Well Ill go said Foma calmly and yawned Isnt it rather late
he asked looking up at the sky which was covered with clouds

Its never too late to go to see them exclaimed Ookhtishchev
merrily



CHAPTER VIII

ON the third day after the scene in the club Foma found himself
about seven versts from the town on the timberwharf of the merchant
Zvantzev in the company of the merchants son of Ookhtishcheva
sedate baldheaded and rednosed gentleman with side whiskersand four
ladies The young Zvantzev wore eyeglasses was thin and pale and when
he stood the calves of his legs were forever trembling as though they
were disgusted at supporting the feeble body clad in a long checked
topcoat with a cape in whose folds a small head in a jockey cap was
comically shaking The gentleman with the side whiskers called him Jean
and pronounced this name as though he was suffering from an inveterate
cold Jeans lady was a tall stout woman with a showy bust Her
head was compressed on the sides her low forehead receded her long
sharppointed nose gave her face an expression somewhat birdlike And
this ugly face was perfectly motionless and the eyes alone small
round and cold were forever smiling a penetrating and cunning smile
Ookhtishchevs ladys name was Vera she was a tall pale woman with red
hair She had so much hair that it seemed as though the woman had put
on her head an enormous cap which was coming down over her ears her
cheeks and her high forehead from under which her large blue eyes
looked forth calmly and lazily

The gentleman with the side whiskers sat beside a young plump buxom
girl who constantly giggled in a ringing voice at something which he
whispered in her ear as he leaned over her shoulder

And Fomas lady was a stately brunette clad all in black
Darkcomplexioned with wavy locks she kept her head so erect and high
and looked at everything about her with such condescending haughtiness
that it was at once evident that she considered herself the most
important person there

The company were seated on the extreme link of the raft extending far
into the smooth expanse of the river Boards were spread out on the
raft and in the centre stood a crudely constructed table empty bottles
provision baskets candywrappers and orange peels were scattered about
everywhere In the corner of the raft was a pile of earth upon which
a bonfire was burning and a peasant in a short fur coat squatting
warmed his hands over the fire and cast furtive glances at the people
seated around the table They had just finished eating their sturgeon
soup and now wines and fruits were before them on the table

Fatigued with a twodays spree and with the dinner that had just been
finished the company was in a weary frame of mind They all gazed
at the river chatting but their conversation was now and again
interrupted by long pauses

The day was clear and bright and young as in spring The cold
clear sky stretched itself majestically over the turbid water of the
giganticallywide overflowing river which was as calm as the sky and
as vast as the sea The distant mountainous shore was tenderly bathed
in bluish mist Through it there on the mountain tops the crosses
of churches were flashing like big stars The river was animated at the
mountainous shore steamers were going hither and thither and their
noise came in deep moans toward the rafts and into the meadows where
the calm flow of the waves filled the air with soft and faint sounds
Gigantic barges stretched themselves one after another against the
current like huge pigs tearing asunder the smooth expanse of the
river Black smoke came in ponderous puffs from the chimneys of the
steamers slowly melting in the fresh air which was full of bright
sunshine At times a whistle resoundedit was like the roar of some
huge enraged animal embittered by toil And on the meadows near the
rafts all was calm and silent Solitary trees that had been drowned
by the flood were now already covered with lightgreen spangles of
foliage Covering their roots and reflecting their tops the water gave
them the appearance of globes and it seemed as though the slightest
breeze would send them floating fantastically beautiful down the
mirrorlike bosom of the river

The redhaired woman pensively gazing into the distance began to sing
softly and sadly

Along the Volga river A little boat is floooating

The brunette snapping her large stern eyes with contempt said
without looking at her We feel gloomy enough without this

Dont touch her Let her sing entreated Foma kindly looking into
his ladys face He was pale some spark seemed to flash up in his eyes
now and then and an indefinite indolent smile played about his lips

Let us sing in chorus suggested the man with the side whiskers

No let these two sing exclaimed Ookhtishchev with enthusiasm
Vera sing that song You know I will go at dawn How is it Sing
Pavlinka

The giggling girl glanced at the brunette and asked her respectfully

Shall I sing Sasha

I shall sing myself announced Fomas companion and turning toward
the lady with the birdlike face she ordered

Vassa sing with me

Vassa immediately broke off her conversation with Zvantzev stroked her
throat a little with her hand and fixed her round eyes on the face of
her sister Sasha rose to her feet leaned her hand against the table
and her head lifted haughtily began to declaim in a powerful almost
masculine voice

Life on earth is bright to him Who knows no cares or woe And whose
heart is not consumed By passions ardent glow

Her sister nodded her head and slowly plaintively began to moan in a
deep contralto

Ah me Of me the maiden fair

Flashing her eyes at her sister Sasha exclaimed in her lowpitched
notes

Like a blade of grass my heart has withered

The two voices mingled and floated over the water in melodious full
sounds which quivered from excess of power One of them was complaining
of the unbearable pain in the heart and intoxicated by the poison
of its plaint it sobbed with melancholy and impotent grief sobbed
quenching with tears the fire of the suffering The otherthe lower
more masculine voicerolled powerfully through the air full of the
feeling of bloody mortification and of readiness to avenge Pronouncing
the words distinctly the voice came from her breast in a deep stream
and each word reeked with boiling blood stirred up by outrage poisoned
by offence and mightily demanding vengeance

 I will requite him

sang Vassa plaintively closing her eyes

 I will inflame him
 Ill dry him up

Sasha promised sternly and confidently wafting into the air strong
powerful tones which sounded like blows And suddenly changing the
tempo of the song and striking a higher pitch she began to sing as
slowly as her sister voluptuous and exultant threats

Drier than the raging wind Drier than the mowndown grass Oi the
mown and driedup grass

Resting his elbows on the table Foma bent his head and with knitted
brow gazed into the face of the woman into her black halfshut eyes
Staring fixedly into the distance her eyes flashed so brightly and
malignantly that because of their light the velvety voice that burst
from the womans chest seemed to him also black and flashing like her
eyes He recalled her caresses and thought

How does she come to be such as she is It is even fearful to be with
her

Ookhtishchev sitting close to his lady an expression of happiness on
his face listened to the song and was radiant with satisfaction The
gentleman with the side whiskers and Zvantzev were drinking wine softly
whispering something as they leaned toward each other The redheaded
woman was thoughtfully examining the palm of Ookhtishchevs hand
holding it in her own and the jolly girl became sad She drooped her
head low and listened to the song motionless as though bewitched
by it From the fire came the peasant He stepped carefully over the
boards on tiptoe his hands were clasped behind his back and his
broad bearded face was now transformed into a smile of astonishment and
of a naive delight

Eh but feel my kind brave man

entreated Vassa plaintively nodding her head And her sister her
chest bent forward her hand still higher wound up the song in powerful
triumphant notes

The yearning and the pangs of love

When she finished singing she looked haughtily about her and seating
herself by Fomas side clasped his neck with a firm and powerful hand

Well was it a nice song

Its capital said Foma with a sigh as he smiled at her

The song filled his heart with thirst for tenderness and still full
of charming sounds it quivered but at the touch of her arm he felt
awkward and ashamed before the other people

Bravoo Bravo Aleksandra Sarelyevna shouted Ookhtishchev and the
others were clapping their hands But she paid no attention to them and
embracing Foma authoritatively said

Well make me a present of something for the song

Very well I will Foma assented

What

You tell me

Ill tell you when we come to town And if youll give me what I
likeOh how I will love you

For the present asked Foma smiling suspiciously You ought to love
me anyway

She looked at him calmly and after a moments thought said resolutely

Its too soon to love you anyway I will not lie Why should I lie
to you I am telling you frankly I love you for money for presents
Because aside from money men have nothing They cannot give anything
more than money Nothing of worth I know it well already One can love
merely so Yes wait a littleIll know you better and then perhaps I
may love you free of charge And meanwhile you mustnt take me amiss I
need much money in my mode of life

Foma listened to her smiled and now and then quivered from the nearness
of her sound wellshaped body Zvantzevs sour cracked and boring
voice was falling on his ears I dont like it I cannot understand the
beauty of this renowned Russian song What is it that sounds in it Eh
The howl of a wolf Something hungry wild Eh its the groan of a sick
dogaltogether something beastly Theres nothing cheerful theres no
chic to it there are no live and vivifying sounds in it No you ought
to hear what and how the French peasant sings Ah or the Italian

Excuse me Ivan Nikolayevich cried Ookhtishchev agitated

I must agree with you the Russian song is monotonous and gloomy It
has not you know that brilliancy of culture said the man with the
side whiskers wearily as he sipped some wine out of his glass

But nevertheless there is always a warm heart in it put in the
redhaired lady as she peeled an orange

The sun was setting Sinking somewhere far beyond the forest on the
meadow shore it painted the entire forest with purple tints and cast
rosy and golden spots over the dark cold water Foma gazed in that
direction at this play of the sunbeams watched how they quivered as
they were transposed over the placid and vast expanse of waters and
catching fragments of conversation he pictured to himself the words as
a swarm of dark butterflies busily fluttering in the air Sasha
her head resting on his shoulder was softly whispering into his ear
something at which he blushed and was confused for he felt that she
was kindling in him the desire to embrace this woman and kiss her
unceasingly Aside from her none of those assembled there interested
himwhile Zvantzev and the gentleman with the side whiskers were
actually repulsive to him

What are you staring at Eh he heard Ookhtishchevs jestinglystern
voice

The peasant at whom Ookhtishchev shouted drew the cap from his head
clapped it against his knee and answered with a smile

I came over to listen to the ladys song

Well does she sing well

What a question Of course said the peasant looking at Sasha with
admiration in his eyes

Thats right exclaimed Ookhtishchev

There is a great power of voice in that ladys breast said the
peasant nodding his head

At his words the ladies burst out laughing and the men made some
doublemeaning remarks about Sasha

After she had calmly listened to these and said nothing in reply Sasha
asked the peasant

Do you sing

We sing a little and he waved his hand What songs do you know

All kinds I love singing And he smiled apologetically

Come lets sing something together you and I

How can we Am I a match for you

Well strike up

May I sit down

Come over here to the table

How lively this is exclaimed Zvantzev wrinkling his face

If you find it tedious go and drown yourself said Sasha angrily
flashing her eyes at him

No the water is cold replied Zvantzev shrinking at her glance

As you please The woman shrugged her shoulders But it is about
time you did it and then theres also plenty of water now so that you
wouldnt spoil it all with your rotten body

Fie how witty hissed the youth turning away from her and added
with contempt In Russia even the prostitutes are rude

He addressed himself to his neighbour but the latter gave him only an
intoxicated smile in return Ookhtishchev was also drunk Staring
into the face of his companion with his eyes grown dim he muttered
something and heard nothing The lady with the birdlike face was
pecking candy holding the box under her very nose Pavlinka went away
to the edge of the raft and standing there threw orange peels into the
water

I never before participated in such an absurd outing andcompany
said Zvantzev to his neighbour plaintively

And Foma watched him with a smile delighted that this feeble and
uglylooking man felt bored and that Sasha had insulted him Now and
then he cast at her a kind glance of approval He was pleased with the
fact that she was so frank with everybody and that she bore herself
proudly like a real gentlewoman

The peasant seated himself on the boards at her feet clasped his knees
in his hands lifted his face to her and seriously listened to her
words

You must raise your voice when I lower mine understand

I understand but Madam you ought to hand me some just to give me
courage

Foma give him a glass of brandy

And when the peasant emptied it cleared his throat with pleasure
licked his lips and said Now I can do it she ordered knitting her
brow

Begin

The peasant made a wry mouth lifted his eyes to her face and started
in a highpitched tenor

I cannot drink I cannot eat

Trembling in every limb the woman sobbed out tremulously with strange
sadness

Wine cannot gladden my soul

The peasant smiled sweetly tossed his head to and fro and closing his
eyes poured out into the air a tremulous wave of highpitched notes

Oh time has come for me to bid goodbye

And the woman shuddering and writhing moaned and wailed

Oi from my kindred I must part

Lowering his voice and swaying to and fro the peasant declaimed in a
singsong with a remarkably intense expression of anguish

Alas to foreign lands I must depart

When the two voices yearning and sobbing poured forth into the silence
and freshness of the evening everything about them seemed warmer and
better everything seemed to smile the sorrowful smile of sympathy on
the anguish of the man whom an obscure power is tearing away from his
native soil into some foreign place where hard labour and degradation
are in store for him It seemed as though not the sounds nor the song
but the burning tears of the human heart in which the plaint had surged
upit seemed as though these tears moistened the air Wild grief and
pain from the sores of body and soul which were wearied in the struggle
with stern life intense sufferings from the wounds dealt to man by the
iron hand of wantall this was invested in the simple crude words and
was tossed in ineffably melancholy sounds toward the distant empty sky
which has no echo for anybody or anything

Foma had stepped aside from the singers and stared at them with a
feeling akin to fright and the song in a huge wave poured forth
into his breast and the wild power of grief with which it had been
invested clutched his heart painfully He felt that tears would soon
gush from his breast something was clogging his throat and his face
was quivering He dimly saw Sashas black eyes immobile and flashing
gloomily they seemed to him enormous and still growing larger and
larger And it seemed to him that it was not two persons who were
singingthat everything about him was singing and sobbing quivering
and palpitating in torrents of sorrow madly striving somewhere
shedding burning tears and alland all things living seemed clasped in
one powerful embrace of despair And it seemed to him that he too was
singing in unison with all of themwith the people the river and the
distant shore whence came plaintive moans that mingled with the song

Now the peasant went down on his knees and gazing at Sasha waved his
hands and she bent down toward him and shook her head keeping time
to the motions of his hands Both were now singing without words with
sounds only and Foma still could not believe that only two voices were
pouring into the air these moans and sobs with such mighty power

When they had finished singing Foma trembling with excitement with a
tearstained face gazed at them and smiled sadly

Well did it move you asked Sasha Pale with fatigue she breathed
quickly and heavily

Foma glanced at the peasant The latter was wiping the sweat off his
brow and looking around him with such a wandering look as though he
could not make out what had taken place

All was silence All were motionless and speechless

Oh Lord sighed Foma rising to his feet Eh Sasha Peasant Who are
you he almost shouted

I amStepan said the peasant smiling confusedly and also rose to
his feet Im Stepan Of course

How you sing Ah Foma exclaimed in astonishment uneasily shifting
from foot to foot

Eh your Honour sighed the peasant and added softly and convincingly
Sorrow can compel an ox to sing like a nightingale And what makes
the lady sing like this only God knows And she sings with all her
veinsthat is to say so you might just lie down and die with sorrow
Well thats a lady

That was sung very well said Ookhtishchev in a drunken voice

No the devil knows what this is Zvantzev suddenly shouted almost
crying irritated as he jumped up from the table Ive come out here
for a good time I want to enjoy myself and here they perform a funeral
service for me What an outrage I cant stand this any longer Im
going away

Jean I am also going Im weary too announced the gentleman with
the side whiskers

Vassa cried Zvantzev to his lady dress yourself

Yes its time to go said the redhaired lady to Ookhtishchev It is
cold and it will soon be dark

Stepan Clear everything away commanded Vassa

All began to bustle about all began to speak of something Foma stared
at them in suspense and shuddered Staggering the crowd walked
along the rafts Pale and fatigued they said to one another stupid
disconnected things Sasha jostled them unceremoniously as she was
getting her things together

Stepan Call for the horses

And Ill drink some more cognac Who wants some more cognac with
me drawled the gentleman with the side whiskers in a beatific voice
holding a bottle in his hands

Vassa was muffling Zvantzevs neck with a scarf He stood in front of
her frowning dissatisfied his lips curled capriciously the calves of
his legs shivering Foma became disgusted as he looked at them and
he went off to the other raft He was astonished that all these people
behaved as though they had not heard the song at all In his breast
the song was alive and there it called to life a restless desire to do
something to say something But he had no one there to speak to

The sun had set and the distance was enveloped in blue mist Foma
glanced thither and turned away He did not feel like going to town with
these people neither did he care to stay here with them And they were
still pacing the raft with uneven steps shaking from side to side and
muttering disconnected words The women were not quite as drunk as the
men and only the redhaired one could not lift herself from the bench
for a long time and finally when she rose she declared

Well Im drunk

Foma sat down on a log of wood and lifting the axe with which the
peasant had chopped wood for the fire he began to play with it tossing
it up in the air and catching it

Oh my God How mean this is Zvantzevs capricious voice was heard

Foma began to feel that he hated it and him and everybody except
Sasha who awakened in him a certain uneasy feeling which contained
at once admiration for her and a fear lest she might do something
unexpected and terrible

Brute shouted Zvantzev in a shrill voice and Foma noticed that he
struck the peasant on the chest after which the peasant removed his cap
humbly and stepped aside

Foool cried Zvantzev walking after him and lifting his hand

Foma jumped to his feet and said threateningly in a loud voice

Eh you Dont touch him

Whaaat Zvantzev turned around toward him

Stepan come over here called Foma

Peasant Zvantzev hurled with contempt looking at Foma

Foma shrugged his shoulders and made a step toward him but suddenly
a thought flashed vividly through his mind He smiled maliciously and
inquired of Stepan softly

The string of rafts is moored in three places isnt it

In three of course

Cut the connections

And they

Keep quiet Cut

But

Cut Quietly so they dont notice it

The peasant took the axe in his hands slowly walked up to the place
where one link was well fastened to another link struck a few times
with his axe and returned to Foma

Im not responsible your Honour he said

Dont be afraid

Theyve started off whispered the peasant with fright and hastily
made the sign of the cross And Foma gazed laughing softly and
experienced a painful sensation that keenly and sharply stung his heart
with a certain strange pleasant and sweet fear

The people on the raft were still pacing to and fro moving about
slowly jostling one another assisting the ladies with their wraps
laughing and talking and the raft was meanwhile turning slowly and
irresolutely in the water

If the current carries them against the fleet whispered the
peasant theyll strike against the bowsand theyll be smashed into
splinters

Keep quiet

Theyll drown

Youll get a boat and overtake them

Thats it Thank you What then Theyre after all human beings
And well be held responsible for them Satisfied now laughing with
delight the peasant dashed in bounds across the rafts to the shore And
Foma stood by the water and felt a passionate desire to shout something
but he controlled himself in order to give time for the raft to float
off farther so that those drunken people would not be able to jump
across to the moored links He experienced a pleasant caressing
sensation as he saw the raft softly rocking upon the water and floating
off farther and farther from him every moment The heavy and dark
feeling with which his heart had been filled during this time now
seemed to float away together with the people on the raft Calmly he
inhaled the fresh air and with it something sound that cleared his
brain At the very edge of the floating raft stood Sasha with her
back toward Foma he looked at her beautiful figure and involuntarily
recalled Medinskaya The latter was smaller in size The recollection of
her stung him and he cried out in a loud mocking voice

Eh there Goodbye Ha ha ha

Suddenly the dark figures of the people moved toward him and crowded
together in one group in the centre of the raft But by this time a
clear strip of water about three yards wide was flashing between them
and Foma

There was a silence lasting for a few seconds

Then suddenly a hurricane of shrill repulsively pitiful sounds which
were full of animal fright was hurled at Foma and louder than all and
more repulsive than all Zvantzevs shrill jarring cry pierced the ear

Heeelp

Some onein all probability the sedate gentleman with the side
whiskersroared in his basso

Drowning Theyre drowning people

Are you people cried Foma angrily irritated by their screams which
seemed to bite him And the people ran about on the raft in the madness
of fright the raft rocked under their feet floated faster on account
of this and the agitated water was loudly splashing against and under
it The screams rent the air the people jumped about waving their
hands and the stately figure of Sasha alone stood motionless and
speechless on the edge of the raft

Give my regards to the crabs cried Foma Foma felt more and more
cheerful and relieved in proportion as the raft was floating away from
him

Foma Ignatyevich said Ookhtishchev in a faint but sober voice look
out this is a dangerous joke Ill make a complaint

When you are drowned You may complain answered Foma cheerfully

You are a murderer exclaimed Zvantzev sobbing But at this time a
ringing splash of water was heard as though it groaned with fright or
with astonishment Foma shuddered and became as though petrified
Then rang out the wild deafening shrieks of the women and the
terrorstricken screams of men and all the figures on the raft remained
petrified in their places And Foma staring at the water felt
as though he really were petrified In the water something black
surrounded with splashes was floating toward him

Rather instinctively than consciously Foma threw himself with his chest
on the beams of the raft and stretched out his hands his head hanging
down over the water Several incredibly long seconds passed Cold
wet arms clasped his neck and dark eyes flashed before him Then he
understood that it was Sasha

The dull horror which had suddenly seized him vanished replaced now
by wild rebellious joy Having dragged the woman out of the water he
grasped her by the waist clasped her to his breast and not knowing
what to say to her he stared into her eyes with astonishment She
smiled at him caressingly

I am cold said Sasha softly and quivered in every limb

Foma laughed gaily at the sound of her voice lifted her into his arms
and quickly almost running dashed across the rafts to the shore She
was wet and cold but her breathing was hot it burned Fomas cheek and
filled his breast with wild joy

You wanted to drown me said she firmly pressing close to him It
was rather too early Wait

How well you have done it muttered Foma as he ran

Youre a fine brave fellow And your device wasnt bad either though
you seem to be so peaceable

And they are still roaring there ha ha

The devil take them If they are drowned well be sent to Siberia
said the woman as though she wanted to console and encourage him by
this She began to shiver and the shudder of her body felt by Foma
made him hasten his pace

Sobs and cries for help followed them from the river There on the
placid water floated in the twilight a small island withdrawing from
the shore toward the stream of the main current of the river and on
that little island dark human figures were running about

Night was closing down upon them



CHAPTER IX

ONE Sunday afternoon Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin was drinking tea in his
garden and talking to his daughter The collar of his shirt unbuttoned
a towel wound round his neck he sat on a bench under a canopy of
verdant cherrytrees waved his hands in the air wiped the perspiration
off his face and incessantly poured forth into the air his brisk
speech

The man who permits his belly to have the upper hand over him is a
fool and a rogue Is there nothing better in the world than eating and
drinking Upon what will you pride yourself before people if you are
like a hog

The old mans eyes sparkled irritably and angrily his lips twisted with
contempt and the wrinkles of his gloomy face quivered

If Foma were my own son I would have made a man of him

Playing with an acacia branch Lubov mutely listened to her fathers
words now and then casting a close and searching look in his agitated
quivering face Growing older she changed without noticing it her
suspicious and cold relation toward the old man In his words she now
began to find the same ideas that were in her books and this won her
over on her fathers side involuntarily causing the girl to prefer
his live words to the cold letters of the book Always overwhelmed with
business affairs always alert and clever he went his own way alone
and she perceived his solitude knew how painful it was and her
relations toward her father grew in warmth At times she even entered
into arguments with the old man he always regarded her remarks
contemptuously and sarcastically but more tenderly and attentively from
time to time

If the deceased Ignat could read in the newspapers of the indecent life
his son is leading he would have killed Foma said Mayakin striking
the table with his fists How they have written it up Its a
disgrace

He deserves it said Lubov

I dont say it was done at random Theyve barked at him as was
necessary And who was it that got into such a fit of anger

What difference does it make to you asked the girl

Its interesting to know How cleverly the rascal described Fomas
behaviour Evidently he must have been with him and witnessed all the
indecency himself

Oh no he wouldnt go with Foma on a spree said Lubov confidently
and blushed deeply at her fathers searching look

So You have fine acquaintances Lubka said Mayakin with humorous
bitterness Well who wrote it

What do you wish to know it for papa

Come tell me

She had no desire to tell but the old man persisted and his voice was
growing more and more dry and angry Then she asked him uneasily

And you will not do him any ill for it

I I willbite his head off Fool What can I do to him They these
writers are not a foolish lot and are therefore a powera power the
devils And I am not the governor and even he cannot put ones hand out
of joint or tie ones tongue Like mice they gnaw us little by little
And we have to poison them not with matches but with roubles Yes
Well who is it

Do you remember when I was going to school a Gymnasium student used
to come up to us Yozhov Such a dark little fellow

Mm Of course I saw him I know him So its he

Yes

The little mouse Even at that time one could see already that
something wrong would come out of him Even then he stood in the way of
other people A bold boy he was I should have looked after him then
Perhaps I might have made a man of him

Lubov looked at her father smiled inimically and asked hotly

And isnt he who writes for newspapers a man

For a long while the old man did not answer his daughter Thoughtfully
he drummed with his fingers against the table and examined his face
which was reflected in the brightly polished brass of the samovar Then
he raised his head winked his eyes and said impressively and irritably

They are not men they are sores The blood of the Russian people has
become mixed it has become mixed and spoiled and from the bad
blood have come all these book and newspaperwriters these terrible
Pharisees They have broken out everywhere and they are still breaking
out more and more Whence comes this spoiling of the blood From
slowness of motion Whence the mosquitoes for instance From the swamp
All sorts of uncleanliness multiply in stagnant waters The same is true
of a disordered life

That isnt right papa said Lubov softly

What do you mean bynot right

Writers are the most unselfish people they are noble personalities
They dont want anythingall they strive for is justicetruth Theyre
not mosquitoes

Lubov grew excited as she lauded her beloved people her face was
flushed and her eyes looked at her father with so much feeling as
though imploring him to believe her being unable to convince him

Eh you said the old man with a sigh interrupting her Youve read
too much Youve been poisoned Tell mewho are they No one knows
That Yozhovwhat is he Only God knows All they want is the truth you
say What modest people they are And suppose truth is the very dearest
thing there is Perhaps everybody is seeking it in silence Believe
meman cannot be unselfish Man will not fight for what belongs not to
him and if he does fighthis name is fool and he is of no use to
anybody A man must be able to stand up for himself for his own then
will he attain something Here you have it Truth Here I have been
reading the same newspaper for almost forty years and I can see
wellhere is my face before you and before me there on the samovar is
again my face but it is another face You see these newspapers give
a samovar face to everything and do not see the real one And yet you
believe them But I know that my face on the samovar is distorted No
one can tell the real truth mans throat is too delicate for this And
then the real truth is known to nobody

Papa exclaimed Lubov sadly But in books and in newspapers they
defend the general interests of all the people

And in what paper is it written that you are weary of life and that
it was time for you to get married So there your interest is not
defended Eh You Neither is mine defended Who knows what I need Who
but myself understands my interests

No papa that isnt right that isnt right I cannot refute you but
I feel that this isnt right said Lubov almost with despair

It is right said the old man firmly Russia is confused and there
is nothing steadfast in it everything is staggering Everybody lives
awry everybody walks on one side theres no harmony in life All are
yelling out of tune in different voices And not one understands what
the other is in need of There is a mist over everythingeverybody
inhales that mist and thats why the blood of the people has become
spoiledhence the sores Man is given great liberty to reason but is
not permitted to do anythingthats why man does not live but rots and
stinks

What ought one to do then asked Lubov resting her elbows on the
table and bending toward her father

Everything cried the old man passionately Do everything Go ahead
Let each man do whatever he knows best But for that liberty must
be given to mancomplete freedom Since there has come a time when
everyraw youth believes that he knows everything and was created for the
complete arrangement of lifegive him give the rogue freedom Here
Carrion live Come come live Ah Then such a comedy will follow
feeling that his bridle is off man will then rush up higher than his
ears and like a feather will fly hither and thither Hell believe
himself to be a miracle worker and then hell start to show his
spirit

The old man paused awhile and lowering his voice went on with a
malicious smile

But there is very little of that creative spirit in him Hell bristle
up for a day or two stretch himself on all sidesand the poor fellow
will soon grow weak For his heart is rottenhe he he Here he he
he The dear fellow will be caught by the real worthy people by those
real people who are competent to be the actual civil masters who will
manage life not with a rod nor with a pen but with a finger and with
brains

What they will say Have you grown tired gentlemen What they will
say your spleens cannot stand a real fire can they So and raising
his voice the old man concluded his speech in an authoritative tone

Well then now you rabble hold your tongues and dont squeak Or
well shake you off the earth like worms from a tree Silence dear
fellows Ha ha ha Thats how its going to happen Lubavka He he
he

The old man was in a merry mood His wrinkles quivered and carried away
by his words he trembled closed his eyes now and then and smacked his
lips as though tasting his own wisdom

And then those who will take the upper hand in the confusion will
arrange life wisely after their own fashion Then things wont go at
random but as if by rote Its a pity that we shall not live to see
it

The old mans words fell one after another upon Lubov like meshes of a
big strong netthey fell and enmeshed her and the girl unable to free
herself from them maintained silence dizzied by her fathers words
Staring into his face with an intense look she sought support for
herself in his words and heard in them something similar to what she
had read in books and which seemed to her the real truth But the
malignant triumphant laughter of her father stung her heart and the
wrinkles which seemed to creep about on his face like so many dark
little snakes inspired her with a certain fear for herself in his
presence She felt that he was turning her aside from what had seemed so
simple and so easy in her dreams

Papa she suddenly asked the old man in obedience to a thought and a
desire that unexpectedly flashed through her mind Papa and what sort
of a manwhat in your opinion is Taras

Mayakin shuddered His eyebrows began to move angrily he fixed his
keen small eyes on his daughters face and asked her drily

What sort of talk is this

Must he not even be mentioned said Lubov softly and confusedly

I dont want to speak of himand I also advise you not to speak of him
the old man threatened her with his finger and lowered his head with
a gloomy frown But when he said that he did not want to speak of his
son he evidently did not understand himself correctly for after a
minutes silence he said sternly and angrily

Taraska too is a sore Life is breathing upon you milksops and you
cannot discriminate its genuine scents and you swallow all sorts of
filth wherefore there is trouble in your heads Thats why you are
not competent to do anything and you are unhappy because of this
incompetence Taraska Yes He must be about forty now He is lost to
me A galleyslaveis that my son A bluntsnouted young pig He would
not speak to his father andhe stumbled

What did he do asked Lubov eagerly listening to the old mans words

Who knows It may be that now he cannot understand himself if he
became sensible and he must have become a sensible man hes the son of
a father whos not stupid and then he must have suffered not a little
They coddle them the nihilists They should have turned them over
to me Id show them what to do Into the desert Into the isolated
placesmarch Come now my wise fellows arrange life there according
to your own will Go ahead And as authorities over them Id station the
robust peasants Well now honourable gentlemen you were given to eat
and to drink you were given an educationwhat have you learned Pay
your debts pray Yes I would not spend a broken grosh on them I would
squeeze all the price out of themgive it up You must not set a man at
naught It is not enough to imprison him You transgressed the law and
are a gentleman Never mind you must work Out of a single seed comes
an ear of corn and a man ought not be permitted to perish without being
of use An economical carpenter finds a place for each and every chip of
woodjust so must every man be profitably used up and used up entire
to the very last vein All sorts of trash have a place in life and man
is never trash Eh it is bad when power lives without reason nor is
it good when reason lives without power Take Foma now Who is coming
theregive a look

Turning around Lubov noticed the captain of the Yermak Yefim coming
along the garden path He had respectfully removed his cap and bowed to
her There was a hopelessly guilty expression on his face and he seemed
abashed Yakov Tarasovich recognized him and instantly grown alarmed
he cried

Where are you coming from What has happened

II have come to you said Yefim stopping short at the table with a
low bow

Well I see youve come to me Whats the matter Wheres the
steamer

The steamer is there Yefim thrust his hand somewhere into the air and
heavily shifted from one foot to the other

Where is it devil Speak coherentlywhat has happened cried the old
man enraged

Soa misfortune Yakov

Have you been wrecked

No God saved us

Burned up Well speak more quickly

Yefim drew air into his chest and said slowly

Barge No 9 was sunksmashed up One mans back was broken and one is
altogether missing so that he must have drowned About five more were
injured but not so very badly though some were disabled

Soo drawled out Mayakin measuring the captain with an illomened
look

Well Yefimushka Ill strip your skin off

It wasnt I who did it said Yefim quickly

Not you cried the old man shaking with rage Who then

The master himself

Foma And you Where were you

I was lying in the hatchway

Ah You were lying

I was bound there

Whaat screamed the old man in a shrill voice

Allow me to tell you everything as it happened He was drunk and he
shouted Get away Ill take command myself I said I cant I am
the captain Bind him said he And when they had bound me they
lowered me into the hatchway with the sailors And as the master was
drunk he wanted to have some fun A fleet of boats was coming toward
us Six empty barges towed by Cheruigorez So Foma Ignatyich blocked
their way They whistled More than once I must tell the truththey
whistled

Well

Well and they couldnt manage itthe two barges in front crashed into
us And as they struck the side of our ninth we were smashed to pieces
And the two barges were also smashed But we fared much worse

Mayakin rose from the chair and burst into jarring angry laughter
And Yefim sighed and outstretching his hands said He has a very
violent character When he is sober he is silent most of the time and
walks around thoughtfully but when he wets his springs with
winethen he breaks loose Then he is not master of himself and of his
businessbut their wild enemyyou must excuse me And I want to leave
Yakov Tarasovich I am not used to being without a master I cannot live
without a master

Keep quiet said Mayakin sternly Wheres Foma

There at the same place Immediately after the accident he came to
himself and at once sent for workmen Theyll lift the barge They may
have started by this time

Is he there alone asked Mayakin lowering his head

Not quite replied Yefim softly glancing stealthily at Lubov

Really

Theres a lady with him A dark one

So

It looks as though the woman is out of her wits said Yefim with
a sigh Shes forever singing She sings very well Its very
captivating

I am not asking you about her cried Mayakin angrily The wrinkles
of his face were painfully quivering and it seemed to Lubov that her
father was about to weep

Calm yourself papa she entreated caressingly Maybe the loss isnt
so great

Not great cried Yakov Tarasovich in a ringing voice What do you
understand you fool Is it only that the barge was smashed Eh you A
man is lost Thats what it is And he is essential to me I need him
dull devils that you are The old man shook his head angrily and with
brisk steps walked off along the garden path leading toward the house

And Foma was at this time about four hundred versts away from his
godfather in a village hut on the shore of the Volga He had just
awakened from sleep and lying on the floor on a bed of fresh hay in
the middle of the hut he gazed gloomily out of the window at the sky
which was covered with gray scattered clouds

The wind was tearing them asunder and driving them somewhere heavy and
weary one overtaking another they were passing across the sky in an
enormous flock Now forming a solid mass now breaking into fragments
now falling low over the earth in silent confusion now again rising
upward one swallowed by another

Without moving his head which was heavy from intoxication Foma looked
long at the clouds and finally began to feel as though silent clouds
were also passing through his breastpassing breathing a damp
coldness upon his heart and oppressing him There was something impotent
in the motion of the clouds across the sky And he felt the same within
him Without thinking he pictured to himself all he had gone through
during the past months It seemed to him as though he had fallen into a
turbid boiling stream and now he had been seized by dark waves that
resembled these clouds in the sky had been seized and carried away
somewhere even as the clouds were carried by the wind In the darkness
and the tumult which surrounded him he saw as though through a mist
that certain other people were hastening together with himtoday not
those of yesterday new ones each day yet all looking alikeequally
pitiful and repulsive Intoxicated noisy greedy they flew about
him as in a whirlwind caroused at his expense abused him fought
screamed and even wept more than once And he beat them He remembered
that one day he had struck somebody on the face torn someones coat off
and thrown it into the water and that some one had kissed his hands with
wet cold lips as disgusting as frogs Had kissed and wept imploring
him not to kill Certain faces flashed through his memory certain
sounds and words rang in it A woman in a yellow silk waist unfastened
at the breast had sung in a loud sobbing voice

 And so let us live while we can
 And theneen grass may cease to grow

All these people like himself grown wild and beastlike were seized by
the same dark wave and carried away like rubbish All these people
like himself must have been afraid to look forward to see whither this
powerful wild wave was carrying them And drowning their fear in wine
they were rushing forward down the current struggling shouting doing
something absurd playing the fool clamouring clamouring without ever
being cheerful He was doing the same whirling in their midst And now
it seemed to him that he was doing all this for fear of himself in
order to pass the sooner this strip of life or in order not to think of
what would be afterward

Amid the burning turmoil of carouses in the crowd of people seized by
debauchery perplexed by violent passions halfcrazy in their longing
to forget themselvesonly Sasha was calm and contained She never drank
to intoxication always addressed people in a firm authoritative voice
and all her movements were equally confident as though this stream had
not taken possession of her but she was herself mastering its violent
course She seemed to Foma the cleverest person of all those that
surrounded him and the most eager for noise and carouse she held them
all in her sway forever inventing something new and speaking in one and
the same manner to everybody for the driver the lackey and the sailor
she had the same tone and the same words as for her friends and for
Foma She was younger and prettier than Pelageya but her caresses were
silent cold Foma imagined that deep in her heart she was concealing
from everybody something terrible that she would never love anyone
never reveal herself entire This secrecy in the woman attracted him
toward her with a feeling of timorous curiosity of a great strained
interest in her calm cold soul which seemed even as dark as her eyes

Somehow Foma said to her one day

But what piles of money you and I have squandered

She glanced at him and asked

And why should we save it

Indeed why thought Foma astonished by the fact that she reasoned so
simply

Who are you he asked her at another occasion

Why have you forgotten my name

Well the idea

What do you wish to know then

I am asking you about your origin

Ah I am a native of the province of Yaroslavl Im from Ooglich I was
a harpist Well shall I taste sweeter to you now that you know who I
am

Do I know it asked Foma laughing

Isnt that enough for you I shall tell you nothing more about it What
for We all come from the same place both people and beasts And what
is there that I can tell you about myself And what for All this talk
is nonsense Lets rather think a little as to how we shall pass the
day

On that day they took a trip on a steamer with an orchestra of music
drank champagne and every one of them got terribly drunk Sasha sang
a peculiar wonderfully sad song and Foma moved by her singing wept
like a child Then he danced with her the Russian dance and finally
perspiring and fatigued threw himself overboard in his clothes and was
nearly drowned

Now recalling all this and a great deal more he felt ashamed of
himself and dissatisfied with Sasha He looked at her wellshaped
figure heard her even breathing and felt that he did not love this
woman and that she was unnecessary to him Certain gray oppressive
thoughts were slowly springing up in his heavy aching head It seemed
to him as though everything he had lived through during this time was
twisted within him into a heavy and moist ball and that now this ball
was rolling about in his breast unwinding itself slowly and the thin
gray cords were binding him

What is going on in me he thought Ive begun to carouse Why I
dont know how to live I dont understand myself Who am I

He was astonished by this question and he paused over it attempting
to make it clear to himselfwhy he was unable to live as firmly and
confidently as other people do He was now still more tortured by
conscience More uneasy at this thought he tossed about on the hay and
irritated pushed Sasha with his elbow

Be careful said she although nearly asleep

Its all right Youre not such a lady of quality muttered Foma

Whats the matter with you

Nothing

She turned her back to him and said lazily with a lazy yawn

I dreamed that I became a harpist again It seemed to me that I was
singing a solo and opposite me stood a big dirty dog snarling and
waiting for me to finish the song And I was afraid of the dog And I
knew that it would devour me as soon as I stopped singing So I kept
singing singing And suddenly it seemed my voice failed me Horrible
And the dog is gnashing his teeth Oh Lord have mercy on me What does
it mean

Stop your idle talk Foma interrupted her sternly You better tell me
what you know about me

I know for instance that you are awake now she answered without
turning to him

Awake Thats true Ive awakened said Foma thoughtfully and
throwing his arm behind his head went on Thats why I am asking you
What sort of man do you think I am

A man with a drunken headache answered Sasha yawning

Aleksandra exclaimed Foma beseechingly dont talk nonsense Tell
me conscientiously what do you think of me

I dont think anything she said drily Why are you bothering me with
nonsense

Is this nonsense said Foma sadly Eh you devils This is the
principal thing The most essential thing to me

He heaved a deep sigh and became silent After a minutes silence Sasha
began to speak in her usual indifferent voice

Tell him who he is and why he is such as he is Did you ever see Is
it proper to ask such questions of our kind of women And on what ground
should I think about each and every man I have not even time to think
about myself and perhaps I dont feel like doing it at all

Foma laughed drily and said

I wish I were like thisand had no desires for anything

Then the woman raised her head from the pillow looked into Fomas face
and lay down again saying

You are musing too much Look outno good will come of it to you
I cannot tell you anything about yourself It is impossible to say
anything true about a man Who can understand him Man does not know
himself Well here Ill tell youyou are better than others But what
of it

And in what way am I better asked Foma thoughtfully

So When one sings a good songyou weep When one does some mean
thingyou beat him With women you are simple you are not impudent to
them You are peaceable And you can also be daring sometimes

Yet all this did not satisfy Foma

Youre not telling me the right thing said he softly Well I dont
know what you want But see here what are we going to do after they
have raised the barge

What can we do asked Foma

Shall we go to Nizhni or to Kazan

What for

To carouse

I dont want to carouse any more

What else are you going to do

What Nothing

And both were silent for a long time without looking at each other

You have a disagreeable character said Sasha a wearisome
character

But nevertheless I wont get drunk any more said Foma firmly and
confidently

You are lying retorted Sasha calmly

Youll see What do you thinkis it good to lead such a life as this

Ill see

No just tell meis it good

But what is better

Foma looked at her askance and irritated said

What repulsive words you speak

Well here again I havent pleased him said Sasha laughing

What a fine crowd said Foma painfully wrinkling his face Theyre
like trees They also live but how No one understands They are
crawling somewhere And can give no account either to themselves or to
others When the cockroach crawls he knows whither and wherefore he
wants to go And you Whither are you going

Hold on Sasha interrupted him and asked him calmly What have you
to do with me You may take from me all that you want but dont you
creep into my soul

Into your sooul Foma drawled out with contempt Into what soul
He he

She began to pace the room gathering together the clothes that were
scattered everywhere Foma watched her and was displeased because she
did not get angry at him for his words about her soul Her face looked
calm and indifferent as usual but he wished to see her angry or
offended he wished for something human from the woman

The soul he exclaimed persisting in his aim Can one who has a soul
live as you live A soul has fire burning in it there is a sense of
shame in it

By this time she was sitting on a bench putting on her stockings but
at his words she raised her head and sternly fixed her eyes upon his
face

What are you staring at asked Foma

Why do you speak that way said she without lifting her eyes from
him

Because I must

Look outmust you really

There was something threatening in her question Foma felt intimidated
and said this time without provocation in his voice

How could I help speaking

Oh you sighed Sasha and resumed dressing herself

And what about me

Merely so You seem as though you were born of two fathers Do you know
what I have observed among people

Well

If a man cannot answer for himself it means that he is afraid of
himself that his price is a grosh

Do you refer to me asked Foma after a pause

To you too

She threw a pink morning gown over her shoulders and standing in the
centre of the room stretched out her hand toward Foma who lay at her
feet and said to him in a low dull voice

You have no right to speak about my soul You have nothing to do with
it And therefore hold your tongue I may speak If I please I could
tell something to all of you Eh how I could tell it Onlywho will
dare to listen to me if I should speak at the top of my voice And I
have some words about youtheyre like hammers And I could knock you
all on your heads so that you would lose your wits And although you are
all rascalsyou cannot be cured by words You should be burned in the
firejust as fryingpans are burned out on the first Monday of Lent

Raising her hands she abruptly loosened her hair and when it fell over
her shoulders in heavy black locksthe woman shook her head haughtily
and said with contempt

Never mind that I am leading a loose life It often happens that the
man who lives in filth is purer than he who goes about in silks If you
only knew what I think of you you dogs what wrath I bear against you
And because of this wrathI am silent For I fear that if I should sing
it to youmy soul would become empty I would have nothing to live on
Foma looked at her and now he was pleased with her In her words there
was something akin to his frame of mind Laughing he said to her with
satisfaction on his face and in his voice

And I also feel that something is growing within my soul Eh I too
shall have my say when the time comes

Against whom asked Sasha carelessly

Iagainst everybody exclaimed Foma jumping to his feet Against
falsehood I shall ask

Ask whether the samovar is ready Sasha ordered indifferently

Foma glanced at her and cried enraged

Go to the devil Ask yourself

Well all right I shall What are you snarling about

And she stepped out of the hut

In piercing gusts the wind blew across the river striking against its
bosom and covered with troubled dark waves the river was spasmodically
rushing toward the wind with a noisy splash and all in the froth of
wrath The willow bushes on the shore bent low to the groundtrembling
they now were about to lie down on the ground now frightened they
thrust themselves away from it driven by the blows of the wind In the
air rang a whistling a howling and a deep groaning sound that burst
from dozens of human breasts

It goesit goesit goes

This exclamation abrupt as a blow and heavy as the breath from an
enormous breast which is suffocating from exertion was soaring over
the river falling upon the waves as if encouraging their mad play with
the wind and they struck the shores with might

Two empty barges lay anchored by the mountainous shore and their tall
masts rising skyward rocked in commotion from side to side as though
describing some invisible pattern in the air The decks of both barges
were encumbered with scaffolds built of thick brown beams huge sheaves
were hanging everywhere chains and ropes were fastened to them and
rocking in the air the links of the chains were faintly clanging A
throng of peasants in blue and in red blouses pulled a large beam across
the dock and heavily stamping their feet groaned with full chest

It goesit goesit goes

Here and there human figures clung to the scaffoldings like big lumps
of blue and red the wind blowing their blouses and their trousers
gave the men odd forms making them appear now humpbacked now round
and puffed up like bladders The people on the scaffolds and on the
decks of the barges were making fast hewing sawing driving in nails
and big arms with shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows were seen
everywhere The wind scattered splinters of wood and a varied lively
brisk noise in the air the saw gnawed the wood choking with wicked
joy the beams wounded by the axes moaned and groaned drily the
boards cracked sickly as they split from the blows they received the
jointer squeaked maliciously The iron clinking of the chains and the
groaning creaking of the sheaves joined the wrathful roaring of the
waves and the wind howled loudly scattering over the river the noise
of toil and drove the clouds across the sky

Mishkaa The deuce take you cried someone from the top of the
scaffolding And from the deck a largeformed peasant with his head
thrown upward answered

Whaat And the wind playing with his long flaxen beard flung it
into his face

Hand us the end

A resounding basso shouted as through a speakingtrumpet

See how youve fastened this board you blind devil Cant you see
Ill rub your eyes for you

Pull my boys come on

Once morebraveboys cried out some one in a loud beseeching
voice

Handsome and stately in a short cloth jacket and high boots Foma
stood leaning his back against a mast and stroking his beard with his
trembling hand admired the daring work of the peasants The noise about
him called forth in him a persistent desire to shout to work together
with the peasants to hew wood to carry burdens to commandto compel
everybody to pay attention to him and to show them his strength his
skill and the live soul within him But he restrained himself
And standing speechless motionless he felt ashamed and afraid of
something He was embarrassed by the fact that he was master over
everybody there and that if he were to start to work himself no one
would believe that he was working merely to satisfy his desire and not
to spur them on in their work to set them an example And then the
peasants might laugh at him in all probability

A fair and curlyheaded fellow with his shirt collar unbuttoned was
now and again running past him now carrying a log on his shoulder
now an axe in his hands he was skipping along like a frolicsome goat
scattering about him cheerful ringing laughter jests violent oaths
and working unceasingly now assisting one now another as he was
cleverly and quickly running across the deck which was obstructed with
timber and shavings Foma watched him closely and envied this merry
fellow who was radiant with something healthy and inspiring

Evidently he is happy thought Foma and this thought provoked in him
a keen piercing desire to insult him somehow to embarrass him All
those about him were seized with the zest of pressing work all were
unanimously and hastily fastening the scaffoldings arranging the
pulleys preparing to raise the sunken barge from the bottom of the
river all were sound and merrythey all lived While he stood alone
aside from them not knowing what to do not knowing how to do anything
feeling himself superfluous to this great toil It vexed him to feel
that he was superfluous among men and the more closely he watched them
the more intense was this vexation And he was stung most by the thought
that all this was being done for him And yet he was out of place there

Where is my place then he thought gloomily Where is my work Am I
then some deformed being I have just as much strength as any of them
But of what use is it to me The chains clanged the pulleys groaned
the blows of the axes resounded loud over the river and the barges
rocked from the shocks of the waves but to Foma it seemed that he was
rocking not because the barge was rocking under his feet but rather
because he was not able to stand firmly anywhere he was not destined to
do so

The contractor a smallsized peasant with a small pointed gray beard
and with narrow little eyes on his gray wrinkled face came up to him
and said not loud but pronouncing his words with a certain tone from
the bottom of the river He wished that they might not succeed that
they might feel embarrassed in his presence and a wicked thought
flashed through his mind

Perhaps the chains will break

Boys Attention shouted the contractor Start all together God
bless us And suddenly clasping his hands in the air he cried in a
shrill voice

Lethergooo

The labourers took up his shout and all cried out in one voice with
excitement and exertion

Let her go She moves

The pulleys squeaked and creaked the chains clanked strained under the
heavy weight that suddenly fell upon them and the labourers bracing
their chests against the handle of the windlasses roared and tramped
heavily The waves splashed noisily between the barges as though
unwilling to give up their prize to the men Everywhere about Foma
chains and ropes were stretched and they quivered from the strainthey
were creeping somewhere across the deck past his feet like huge gray
worms they were lifted upward link after link falling back with
a rattling noise and all these sounds were drowned by the deafening
roaring of the labourers

It goes it goes it goes they all sang in unison triumphantly
But the ringing voice of the contractor pierced the deep wave of their
voices and cut it even as a knife cuts bread

My boys Go ahead all at once all at once

Foma was seized with a strange emotion passionately he now longed to
mingle with this excited roaring of the labourers which was as broad
and as powerful as the riverto blend with this irritating creaking
squeaking clanging of iron and turbulent splashing of waves
Perspiration came out on his face from the intensity of his desire and
suddenly pale from agitation he tore himself away from the mast and
rushed toward the windlasses with big strides

All at once At once he cried in a fierce voice When he reached
the lever of the windlass he dashed his chest against it with all his
might and not feeling the pain he began to go around the windlass
roaring and firmly stamping his feet against the deck Something
powerful and burning rushed into his breast replacing the efforts
which he spent while turning the windlasslever Inexpressible joy raged
within him and forced itself outside in an agitated cry It seemed to
him that he alone that only his strength was turning the lever thus
raising the weight and that his strength was growing and growing
Stooping and lowering his head like a bull he massed the power of the
weight which threw him back but yielded to him nevertheless Each
step forward excited him the more each expended effort was immediately
replaced in him by a flood of burning and vehement pride His head
reeled his eyes were bloodshot he saw nothing he only felt that
they were yielding to him that he would soon conquer that he would
overthrow with his strength something huge which obstructed his
waywould overthrow conquer and then breathe easily and freely full
of proud delight For the first time in his life he experienced such
a powerful spiritualizing sensation and he drank it with all the
strength of a hungry thirsty soul he was intoxicated by it and he gave
vent to his joy in loud exulting cries in unison with the workers

It goesit goesit goes

Hold on Fasten Hold on boys

Something dashed against Fomas chest and he was hurled backward

I congratulate you on a successful result Foma Ignatyich the
contractor congratulated him and the wrinkles quivered on his face in
cheerful beams

Thank God You must be quite tired now

Cold wind blew in Fomas face A contented boastful bustle was in the
air about him swearing at one another in a friendly way merry with
smiles on their perspiring brows the peasants approached him and
surrounded him closely He smiled in embarrassment the excitement
within him had not yet calmed down and this hindered him from
understanding what had happened and why all those who surrounded him
were so merry and contented

Weve raised a hundred and seventy thousand puds as if we plucked a
radish from a gardenbed said some one

We ought to get a vedro of whisky from our master

Foma standing on a heap of cable looked over the heads of the workers
and saw between the barges side by side with them stood a third
barge black slippery damaged wrapped in chains It was warped all
over it seemed as though it swelled from some terrible disease and
impotent clumsy it was suspended between its companions leaning
against them Its broken mast stood out mournfully in the centre
reddish streams of water like blood were running across the deck
which was covered with stains of rust Everywhere on the deck lay heaps
of iron of black wet stumps of wood and of ropes

Raised asked Foma not knowing what to say at the sight of this ugly
heavy mass and again feeling offended at the thought that merely for
the sake of raising this dirty bruised monster from the water his soul
had foamed up with such joy

Hows the barge asked Foma indefinitely addressing the contractor

Its pretty good We must unload right away and put a company of about
twenty carpenters to work on ittheyll bring it quickly into shape
said the contractor in a consoling tone

And the lighthaired fellow gaily and broadly smiling into Fomas face
asked

Are we going to have any vodka

Cant you wait You have time said the contractor sternly Dont
you seethe man is tired

Then the peasants began to speak

Of course he is tired

That wasnt easy work

Of course one gets tired if he isnt used to work

It is even hard to eat gruel if you are not used to it

I am not tired said Foma gloomily and again were heard the
respectful exclamations of the peasants as they surrounded him more
closely

Work if one likes it is a pleasant thing

Its just like play

Its like playing with a woman

But the lighthaired fellow persisted in his request

Your Honour You ought to treat us to a vedro of vodka eh he said
smiling and sighing

Foma looked at the bearded faces before him and felt like saying
something offensive to them But somehow everything became confused
in his brain he found no thoughts in it and finally without giving
himself an account of his words said angrily

All you want is to drink all the time It makes no difference to you
what you do You should have thoughtwhy to what purpose Eh you

There was an expression of perplexity on the faces of those that
surrounded him blue and red bearded figures began to sigh scratch
themselves shift themselves from one foot to another Others cast a
hopeless glance at Foma and turned away

Yes yes said the contractor with a sigh That wouldnt harm That
isto thinkwhy and how These are words of wisdom

The lighthaired fellow had a different opinion on the matter smiling
kindheartedly he waved his hand and said

We dont have to think over our work If we have itwe do it Our
business is simple When a rouble is earnedthank God we can do
everything

And do you know whats necessary to do questioned Foma irritated by
the contradiction

Everything is necessarythis and that

But wheres the sense

Theres but one and the same sense in everything for our classwhen
you have earned for bread and taxeslive And when theres something to
drink into the bargain

Eh you exclaimed Foma with contempt Youre also talking What do
you understand

Is it our business to understand said the lighthaired fellow with a
nod of the head It now bored him to speak to Foma He suspected that he
was unwilling to treat them to vodka and he was somewhat angry

Thats it said Foma instructively pleased that the fellow yielded
to him and not noticing the cross sarcastic glances And he who
understands feels that it is necessary to do everlasting work

That is for God explained the contractor eyeing the peasants and
added with a devout sigh

Thats true Oh how true that is

And Foma was inspired with the desire to say something correct and
important after which these people might regard him in a different
light for he was displeased with the fact that all save the
lighthaired fellow kept silent and looked at him askance surlily
with such weary gloomy eyes

It is necessary to do such work he said moving his eyebrows Such
work that people may say a thousand years hence This was done by the
peasants of Bogorodskyes

The lighthaired fellow glanced at Foma with astonishment and asked

Are we perhaps to drink the Volga dry Then he sniffed and nodding
his head announced We cant do thatwe should all burst

Foma became confused at his words and looked about him the peasants
were smiling morosely disdainfully sarcastically And these smiles
stung him like needles A seriouslooking peasant with a big gray
beard who had not yet opened his mouth up to that time suddenly opened
it now came closer to Foma and said slowly

And even if we were to drink the Volga dry and eat up that mountain
into the bargainthat too would be forgotten your Honour Everything
will be forgotten Life is long It is not for us to do such deeds
as would stand out above everything else But we can put up
scaffoldingsthat we can

He spoke and sceptically spitting at his feet indifferently walked off
from Foma and slipped into the crowd as a wedge into a tree His
words crushed Foma completely he felt that the peasants considered him
stupid and ridiculous And in order to save his importance as master in
their eyes to attract again the now exhausted attention of the peasants
to himself he bristled up comically puffed up his cheeks and blurted
out in an impressive voice

I make you a present of three buckets of vodka

Brief speeches have always the most meaning and are always apt to
produce a strong impression The peasants respectfully made way for
Foma making low bows to him and smiling merrily and gratefully
thanked him for his generosity in a unanimous roar of approval

Take me over to the shore said Foma feeling that the excitement that
had just been aroused in him would not last long A worm was gnawing his
heart and he was weary

I feel disgusted he said entering the hut where Sasha in a
smart pink gown was bustling about the table arranging wines and
refreshments I feel disgusted Aleksandra If you could only do
something with me eh

She looked at him attentively and seating herself on the bench
shoulder to shoulder with him said

Since you feel disgustedit means that you want something What is it
you want

I dont know replied Foma nodding his head mournfully

Think of itsearch

I am unable to think Nothing comes out of my thinking

Eh you my child said Sasha softly and disdainfully moving away
from him Your head is superfluous to you

Foma neither caught her tone nor noticed her movement Leaning his hands
against the bench he bent forward looked at the floor and swaying
his body to and fro said

Sometimes I think and thinkand the whole soul is stuck round with
thoughts as with tar And suddenly everything disappears without
leaving any trace Then it is dark in the soul as in a cellardark
damp and emptythere is nothing at all in it It is even terribleI
feel then as though I were not a man but a bottomless ravine You ask
me what I want

Sasha looked at him askance and pensively began to sing softly

Eh when the wind blowsmist comes from the sea

I dont want to carouseit is repulsive Always the samethe people
the amusements the wine When I grow maliciousId thrash everybody
I am not pleased with menwhat are they It is impossible to understand
themwhy do they keep on living And when they speak the truthto whom
are we to listen One says this another that While II cannot say
anything

 Eh without thee dear my life is weary

sang Sasha staring at the wall before her And Foma kept on rocking and
said

There are times when I feel guilty before men Everybody lives makes
noise while I am frightened staggeredas if I did not feel the earth
under me Was it perhaps my mother that endowed me with apathy
My godfather says that she was as cold as icethat she was forever
yearning towards something I am also yearning Toward men I am
yearning Id like to go to them and say Brethren help me Teach me
I know not how to live And if I am guiltyforgive me But looking
about I see theres no one to speak to No one wants itthey are all
rascals And it seems they are even worse than I am For I am at least
ashamed of living as I am while they are not They go on

Foma uttered some violent unbecoming invectives and became silent
Sasha broke off her song and moved still farther away from him The wind
was raging outside the window hurling dust against the windowpanes
Cockroaches were rustling on the oven as they crawled over a bunch of
pine wood splinters Somewhere in the yard a calf was lowing pitifully

Sasha glanced at Foma with a sarcastic smile and said

Theres another unfortunate creature lowing You ought to go to him
perhaps you could sing in unison And placing her hand on his curly head
she jestingly pushed it on the side

What are people like yourself good for Thats what you ought to
think of What are you groaning about You are disgusted with being
idleoccupy yourself then with business

Oh Lord Foma nodded his head It is hard for one to make himself
understood Yes it is hard And irritated he almost cried out What
business I have no yearning toward business What is business Business
is merely a nameand if you should look into the depth into the root
of ityoull find it is nothing but absurdity Do I not understand it
I understand everything I see everything I feel everything Only my
tongue is dumb What aim is there in business Money I have plenty
of it I could choke you to death with it cover you with it All this
business is nothing but fraud I meet business peoplewell and what
about them Their greediness is immense and yet they purposely
whirl about in business that they might not see themselves They hide
themselves the devils Try to free them from this bustlewhat will
happen Like blind men they will grope about hither and thither theyll
lose their mindtheyll go mad I know it Do you think that business
brings happiness into man No thats not sosomething else is missing
here This is not everything yet The river flows that men may sail on
it the tree growsto be useful the dogto guard the house There is
justification for everything in the world And men like cockroaches
are altogether superfluous on earth Everything is for them and
theywhat are they for Aha Wherein is their justification Ha ha
ha

Foma was triumphant It seemed to him that he had found something good
for himself something severe against men And feeling that because of
this there was great joy in him he laughed loudly

Does not your head ache inquired Sasha anxiously scrutinizing his
face

My soul aches exclaimed Foma passionately And it aches because it
is uprightbecause it is not to be satisfied with trifles Answer it
how to live To what purpose Theretake my godfatherhe is wise He
sayscreate life But hes the only one like this Well Ill ask him
wait And everybody sayslife has usurped us Life has choked us I
shall ask these too And how can we create life You must keep it in
your hands to do this you must be master over it You cannot make even
a pot without taking the clay into your hands

Listen said Sasha seriously I think you ought to get married
thats all

What for asked Foma shrugging his shoulders

You need a bridle

All right I am living with youyou are all of a kind are you not
One is not sweeter than the other I had one before you of the same
kind as you No but that one did it for loves sake She had taken a
liking to meand consented she was goodbut otherwise she was in
every way the same as youthough you are prettier than she But I took
a liking to a certain ladya lady of noble birth They said she led a
loose life but I did not get her Yes she was clever intelligent
she lived in luxury I used to thinkthats where Ill taste the real
thing I did not get herand it may be if I had succeeded all would
have taken a different turn I yearned toward her I thoughtI could
not tear myself away While now that I have given myself to drink Ive
drowned her in wineI am forgetting herand that also is wrong O man
You are a rascal to be frank

Foma became silent and sank into meditation And Sasha rose from the
bench and paced the hut to and fro biting her lips Then she stopped
short before him and clasping her hands to her head said

Do you know what Ill leave you

Where will you go asked Foma without lifting his head

I dont knowits all the same

But why

Youre always saying unnecessary things It is lonesome with you You
make me sad

Foma lifted his head looked at her and burst into mournful laughter

Really Is it possible

You do make me sad Do you know If I should reflect on it I would
understand what you say and why you say itfor I am also of that
sortwhen the time comes I shall also think of all this And then I
shall be lost But now it is too early for me No I want to live yet
and then later come what will

And Iwill I too be lost asked Foma indifferently already
fatigued by his words

Of course replied Sasha calmly and confidently All such people
are lost He whose character is inflexible and who has no brainswhat
sort of a life is his We are like this

I have no character at all said Foma stretching himself Then after
a moments silence he added

And I have no brains either

They were silent for a minute eyeing each other

What are we going to do asked Foma

We must have dinner

No I mean in general Afterward

Afterward I dont know

So you are leaving me

I am Come lets carouse some more before we part Lets go to Kazan
and there well have a spreesmoke and flame Ill sing your farewell
song

Very well assented Foma Its quite proper at leave taking Eh you
devil Thats a merry life Listen Sasha They say that women of your
kind are greedy for money are even thieves

Let them say said Sasha calmly

Dont you feel offended asked Foma with curiosity But you are not
greedy Its advantageous to you to be with me I am rich and yet you
are going away that shows youre not greedy

I Sasha thought awhile and said with a wave of the hand Perhaps
I am not greedywhat of it I am not of the very lowest of the street
women And against whom shall I feel a grudge Let them say whatever
they please It will be only human talk not the bellowing of bulls And
human holiness and honesty are quite familiar to me Eh how well I know
them If I were chosen as a judge I would acquit the dead only l and
bursting into malicious laughter Sasha said Well that will do weve
spoken enough nonsense Sit down at the table

On the morning of the next day Foma and Sasha stood side by side on
the gangway of a steamer which was approaching a harbour on the Ustye
Sashas big black hat attracted everybodys attention by its deftly
bent brim and its white feathers and Foma was ill at ease as he stood
beside her and felt as though inquisitive glances crawled over his
perplexed face The steamer hissed and quivered as it neared the
landingbridge which was sprinkled by a waiting crowd of people attired
in bright summer clothes and it seemed to Foma that he noticed among
the crowd of various faces and figures a person he knew who now seemed
to be hiding behind other peoples backs and yet lifted not his eye
from him

Lets go into the cabin said he to his companion uneasily

Dont acquire the habit of hiding your sins from people replied
Sasha with a smile Have you perhaps noticed an acquaintance there

Mm Yes Somebody is watching me

A nurse with a milk bottle Ha ha ha

Well there youre neighing said Foma enraged looking at her
askance Do you think I am afraid

I can see how brave you are

Youll see Ill face anybody said Foma angrily but after a close
look at the crowd in the harbour his face suddenly assumed another
expression and he added softly

Oh its my godfather

At the very edge of the landingstage stood Yakov Tarasovich squeezed
between two stout women with his ironlike face lifted upward and he
waved his cap in the air with malicious politeness His beard shook his
bald crown flashed and his small eye pierced Foma like borers

What a vulture muttered Foma raising his cap and nodding his head to
his godfather

His bow evidently afforded great pleasure to Mayakin The old man
somehow coiled himself up stamped his feet and his face seemed beaming
with a malicious smile

The little boy will get money for nuts it seems Sasha teased Foma
Her words together with his godfathers smile seemed to have kindled a
fire in Fomas breast

We shall see what is going to happen hissed Foma and suddenly he
became as petrified in malicious calm The steamer made fast and the
people rushed in a wave to the landingplace Pressed by the crowd
Mayakin disappeared for awhile from the sight of his godson and appeared
again with a maliciously triumphant smile Foma stared at him fixedly
with knitted brow and came toward him slowly pacing the gang planks
They jostled him in the back they leaned on him they squeezed him
and this provoked Foma still more Now he came face to face with the old
man and the latter greeted him with a polite bow and asked

Whither are you travelling Foma Ignatyich

About my affairs replied Foma firmly without greeting his
godfather

Thats praiseworthy my dear sir said Yakov Tarasovich all beaming
with a smile The lady with the featherswhat is she to you may I
ask

Shes my mistress said Foma loud without lowering his eyes at the
keen look of his godfather

Sasha stood behind him calmly examining over his shoulder the little
old man whose head hardly reached Fomas chin Attracted by Fomas loud
words the public looked at them scenting a scandal And Mayakin
too perceived immediately the possibility of a scandal and instantly
estimated correctly the quarrelsome mood of his godson He contracted
his wrinkles bit his lips and said to Foma peaceably

I have something to speak to you about Will you come with me to the
hotel

Yes for a little while

You have no time then Its a plain thing you must be making haste
to wreck another barge eh said the old man unable to contain himself
any longer

And why not wreck them since they can be wrecked retorted Foma
passionately and firmly

Of course you did not earn them yourself why should you spare them
Well come And couldnt we drown that lady in the water for awhile
said Mayakin softly

Drive to the town Sasha and engage a room at the Siberian Inn
Ill be there shortly said Foma and turning to Mayakin he announced
boldly

I am ready Let us go

Neither of them spoke on their way to the hotel Foma seeing that his
godfather had to skip as he went in order to keep up with him purposely
took longer strides and the fact that the old man could not keep step
with him supported and strengthened in him the turbulent feeling of
protest which he was by this time scarcely able to master

Waiter said Mayakin gently on entering the hall of the hotel
and turning toward a remote corner let us have a bottle of moorberry
kvass

And I want some cognac ordered Foma

Soo When you have poor cards you had better always play the lowest
trump first Mayakin advised him sarcastically

You dont know my game said Foma seating himself by the table

Really Come come Many play like that

How

I mean as you doboldly but foolishly

I play so that either the head is smashed to pieces or the wall broken
in half said Foma hotly and struck the table with his fist

Havent you recovered from your drunkenness yet asked Mayakin with a
smile

Foma seated himself more firmly in his chair and his face distorted
with wrathful agitation he said

Godfather you are a sensible man I respect you for your common
sense

Thank you my son and Mayakin bowed rising slightly and leaning his
hands against the table

Dont mention it I want to tell you that I am no longer twenty I am
not a child any longer

Of course not assented Mayakin Youve lived a good while that goes
without saying If a mosquito had lived as long it might have grown as
big as a hen

Stop your joking Foma warned him and he did it so calmly that
Mayakin started back and the wrinkles on his face quivered with alarm

What did you come here for asked Foma

Ah youve done some nasty work here So I want to find out whether
theres much damage in it You see I am a relative of yours And then
I am the only one you have

You are troubling yourself in vain Do you know papa what Ill tell
you Either give me full freedom or take all my business into your own
hands Take everything Everythingto the last rouble

This proposition burst forth from Foma altogether unexpectedly to
himself he had never before thought of anything like it But now that
he uttered such words to his godfather it suddenly became clear to him
that if his godfather were to take from him all his property he would
become a perfectly free man he could go wherever he pleased do
whatever he pleased Until this moment he had been bound and enmeshed
with something but he knew not his fetters and was unable to break
them while now they were falling off of themselves so simply so
easily Both an alarming and a joyous hope blazed up within his breast
as though he noticed that suddenly light had begun to flash upon his
turbid life that a wide spacious road lay open now before him Certain
images sprang up in his mind and watching their shiftings he muttered
incoherently

Here this is better than anything Take everything and be done with
it Andas for meI shall be free to go anywhere in the wide world I
cannot live like this I feel as though weights were hanging on me as
though I were all bound ThereI must not go this I must not do I
want to live in freedom that I may know everything myself I shall
search life for myself For otherwise what am I A prisoner Be kind
take everything The devil take it all Give me freedom pray What
kind of a merchant am I I do not like anything And soI would forsake
meneverything I would find a place for myself I would find some kind
of work and would work By God Father set me at liberty For now you
see I am drinking Im entangled with that woman

Mayakin looked at him listened attentively to his words and his face
was stern immobile as though petrified A dull tavern noise smote
the air some people went past them they greeted Mayakin but he saw
nothing staring fixedly at the agitated face of his godson who smiled
distractedly both joyously and pitifully

Eh my sour blackberry said Mayakin with a sigh interrupting Fomas
speech I see youve lost your way And youre prating nonsense I
would like to know whether the cognac is to blame for it or is it your
foolishness

Papa exclaimed Foma this can surely be done There were cases where
people have cast away all their possessions and thus saved themselves

That wasnt in my time Not people that are near to me said Mayakin
sternly or else I would have shown them how to go away

Many have become saints when they went away

Mm They couldnt have gone away from me The matter is simpleyou
know how to play at draughts dont you Move from one place to another
until you are beaten and if youre not beaten then you have the queen
Then all ways are open to you Do you understand And why am I talking
to you seriously Psha

Papa why dont you want it exclaimed Foma angrily

Listen to me If you are a chimneysweep go carrion on the roof If
you are a fireman stand on the watchtower And each and every sort of
men must have its own mode of life Calves cannot roar like bears If
you live your own life go on live it And dont talk nonsense
and dont creep where you dont belong Arrange your life after your
pattern And from the dark lips of the old man gushed forth in a
trembling glittering stream the jarring but confident and bold words
so familiar to Foma Seized with the thought of freedom which seemed to
him so easily possible Foma did not listen to his words This idea had
eaten into his brains and in his heart the desire grew stronger and
stronger to sever all his connections with this empty and wearisome
life with his godfather with the steamers the barges and the
carouses with everything amidst which it was narrow and stifling for
him to live

The old mans words seemed to fall on him from afar they were blended
with the clatter of the dishes with the scraping of the lackeys feet
along the floor with some ones drunken shouting Not far from them sat
four merchants at a table and argued loudly

Two and a quarterand thank God

Luka Mitrich How can I

Give him two and a half

Thats right You ought to give it its a good steamer it tows
briskly

My dear fellows I cant Two and a quarter

And all this nonsense came to your head from your youthful passion
said Mayakin importantly accompanying his words with a rap on the
table Your boldness is stupidity all these words of yours are
nonsense Would you perhaps go to the cloister or have you perhaps a
longing to go on the highways

Foma listened in silence The buzzing noise about him now seemed to move
farther away from him He pictured himself amid a vast restless crowd
of people without knowing why they bustled about hither and thither
jumped on one another their eyes were greedily opened wide they were
shouting cursing falling crushing one another and they were all
jostling about on one place He felt bad among them because he did not
understand what they wanted because he had no faith in their words
and he felt that they had no faith in themselves that they understood
nothing And if one were to tear himself away from their midst to
freedom to the edge of life and thence behold themthen all would
become clear to him Then he would also understand what they wanted and
would find his own place among them

Dont I understand said Mayakin more gently seeing Foma lost in
thought and assuming that he was reflecting on his wordsI understand
that you want happiness for yourself Well my friend it is not to be
easily seized You must seek happiness even as they search for mushrooms
in the wood you must bend your back in search of it and finding it
see whether it isnt a toadstool

So you will set me free asked Foma suddenly lifting his head and
Mayakin turned his eyes away from his fiery look

Father at least for a short time Let me breathe let me step aside
from everything entreated Foma I will watch how everything goes on
And thenif notI shall become a drunkard

Dont talk nonsense Why do you play the fool cried Mayakin angrily

Very well then replied Foma calmly Very well You do not want it
Then there will be nothing Ill squander it all And there is nothing
more for us to speak of Goodbye Ill set out to work youll see It
will afford you joy Everything will go up in smoke Foma was calm he
spoke with confidence it seemed to him that since he had thus decided
his godfather could not hinder him But Mayakin straightened himself in
his chair and said also plainly and calmly

And do you know how I can deal with you

As you like said Foma with a wave of the hand Well then Now I
like the following Ill return to town and will see to it that you are
declared insane and put into a lunatic asylum

Can this be done asked Foma distrustfully but with a tone of fright
in his voice

We can do everything my dear

Foma lowered his head and casting a furtive glance at his godfathers
face shuddered thinking

Hell do it he wont spare me

If you play the fool seriously I must also deal with you seriously
I promised your father to make a man of you and I will do it if you
cannot stand on your feet Ill put you in irons Then you will stand
Though I know all these holy words of yours are but ugly caprices that
come from excessive drinking But if you do not give that up if
you keep on behaving indecently if you ruin out of wantonness the
property accumulated by your father Ill cover you all up Ill have a
bell forged over you It is very inconvenient to fool with me

Mayakin spoke gently The wrinkles of his cheeks all rose upward and
his small eyes in their dark sockets were smiling sarcastically coldly
And the wrinkles on his forehead formed an odd pattern rising up to his
bald crown His face was stern and merciless and breathed melancholy
and coldness upon Fomas soul

So theres no way out for me asked Foma gloomily You are blocking
all my ways

There is a way Go there I shall guide you Dont worry it will be
right You will come just to your proper place

This selfconfidence this unshakable boastfulness aroused Fomas
indignation Thrusting his hands into his pockets in order not to strike
the old man he straightened himself in his chair and clinching his
teeth said facing Mayakin closely

Why are you boasting What are you boasting of Your own son where is
he Your daughter what is she Eh youyou lifebuilder Well you are
clever You know everything Tell me what for do you live What for
are you accumulating money Do you think you are not going to die Well
what then Youve captured me Youve taken hold of me youve conquered
me But wait I may yet tear myself away from you It isnt the end yet
Eh you What have you done for life By what will you be remembered
My father for instance donated a lodginghouse and youwhat have you
done

Mayakins wrinkles quivered and sank downward wherefore his face
assumed a sickly weeping expression

How will you justify yourself asked Foma softly without lifting his
eyes from him

Hold your tongue you puppy said the old man in a low voice casting
a glance of alarm about the room

Ive said everything And now Im going Hold me back

Foma rose from his chair thrust his cap on his head and measured the
old man with abhorrence

You may go but IllIll catch you It will come out as I say said
Yakov Tarasovich in a broken voice

And Ill go on a spree Ill squander all

Very well well see

Goodbye you hero Foma laughed

Goodbye for a short while Ill not go back on my own I love it I
love you too Never mind youre a good fellow said Mayakin softly
and as though out of breath

Do not love me but teach me But then you cannot teach me the right
thing said Foma as he turned his back on the old man and left the
hall

Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin remained in the tavern alone He sat by the
table and bending over it made drawings of patterns on the tray
dipping his trembling finger in the spilt kvass and his sharppointed
head was sinking lower and lower over the table as though he did not
decipher and could not make out what his bony finger was drawing on the
tray

Beads of perspiration glistened on his bald crown and as usual the
wrinkles on his cheeks quivered with frequent irritable starts

In the tavern a resounding tumult smote the air so that the windowpanes
were rattling From the Volga were wafted the whistlings of steamers
the dull beating of the wheels upon the water the shouting of the
loaderslife was moving onward unceasingly and unquestionably

Summoning the waiter with a nod Yakov Tarasovich asked him with peculiar
intensity and impressiveness

How much do I owe for all this



CHAPTER X

PREVIOUS to his quarrel with Mayakin Foma had caroused because of the
weariness of life out of curiosity and half indifferently now he led
a dissipated life out of spite almost in despair now he was filled
with a feeling of vengeance and with a certain insolence toward men an
insolence which astonished even himself at times He saw that the people
about him like himself lacked support and reason only they did not
understand this or purposely would not understand it so as not to
hinder themselves from living blindly and from giving themselves
completely without a thought to their dissolute life He found
nothing firm in them nothing steadfast when sober they seemed to him
miserable and stupid when intoxicated they were repulsive to him and
still more stupid None of them inspired him with respect with deep
hearty interest he did not even ask them what their names were he
forgot where and when he made their acquaintance and regarding them
with contemptuous curiosity always longed to say and do something that
would offend them He passed days and nights with them in different
places of amusement and his acquaintances always depended just upon
the category of each of these places In the expensive and elegant
restaurants certain sharpers of the better class of society surrounded
himgamblers couplet singers jugglers actors and propertyholders
who were ruined by leading depraved lives At first these people treated
him with a patronizing air and boasted before him of their refined
tastes of their knowledge of the merits of wine and food and then they
courted favours of him fawned upon him borrowed of him money which he
scattered about without counting drawing it from the banks and already
borrowing it on promissory notes In the cheap taverns hairdressers
markers clerks functionaries and choristers surrounded him like
vultures and among these people he always felt betterfreer In these
he saw plain people not so monstrously deformed and distorted as that
clean society of the elegant restaurants these were less depraved
cleverer better understood by him At times they evinced wholesome
strong emotions and there was always something more human in them
But like the clean society these were also eager for money and
shamelessly fleeced him and he saw it and rudely mocked them

To be sure there were women Physically healthy but not sensual Foma
bought them the dear ones and the cheap ones the beautiful and the
ugly gave them large sums of money changed them almost every week
and in general he treated the women better than the men He laughed at
them said to them disgraceful and offensive words but he could never
even when halfdrunk rid himself of a certain bashfulness in their
presence They all even the most brazenfaced the strongest and the
most shameless seemed to him weak and defenseless like small children
Always ready to thrash any man he never laid a hand on women although
when irritated by something he sometimes abused them indecently He felt
that he was immeasurably stronger than any woman and every woman seemed
to him immeasurably more miserable than he was Those of the women who
led their dissolute lives audaciously boasting of their depravity
called forth in Foma a feeling of bashfulness which made him timid
and awkward One evening during supper hour one of these women
intoxicated and impudent struck Foma on the cheek with a melonrind
Foma was halfdrunk He turned pale with rage rose from his chair
and thrusting his hands into his pockets said in a fierce voice which
trembled with indignation

You carrion get out Begone Someone else would have broken your head
for this And you know that I am forbearing with you and that my arm is
never raised against any of your kind Drive her away to the devil

A few days after her arrival in Kazan Sasha became the mistress of a
certain vodkadistillers son who was carousing together with Foma
Going away with her new master to some place on the Kama she said to
Foma

Goodbye dear man Perhaps we may meet again Were both going the same
way But I advise you not to give your heart free rein Enjoy yourself
without looking back at anything And then when the gruel is eaten up
smash the bowl on the ground Goodbye

And she impressed a hot kiss upon his lips at which her eyes looked
still darker

Foma was glad that she was leaving him he had grown tired of her and
her cold indifference frightened him But now something trembled within
him he turned aside from her and said in a low voice

Perhaps you will not live well together then come back to me

Thank you she replied and for some reason or other burst into hoarse
laughter which was uncommon with her

Thus lived Foma day in and day out always turning around on one
and the same place amid people who were always alike and who never
inspired him with any noble feelings And then he considered himself
superior to them because the thoughts of the possibility of freeing
himself from this life was taking deeper and deeper root in his mind
because the yearning for freedom held him in an ever firmer embrace
because ever brighter were the pictures as he imagined himself drifting
away to the border of life away from this tumult and confusion More
than once by night remaining all by himself he would firmly close his
eyes and picture to himself a dark throng of people innumerably great
and even terrible in its immenseness Crowded together somewhere in a
deep valley which was surrounded by hillocks and filled with a
dusty mist this throng jostled one another on the same place in noisy
confusion and looked like grain in a hopper It was as though an
invisible millstone hidden beneath the feet of the crowd were grinding
it and people moved about it like wavesnow rushing downward to be
ground the sooner and disappear now bursting upward in the effort to
escape the merciless millstone There were also people who resembled
crabs just caught and thrown into a huge basketclutching at one
another they twined about heavily crawled somewhere and interfered
with one another and could do nothing to free themselves from
captivity

Foma saw familiar faces amid the crowd there his father is walking
boldly sturdily pushing aside and overthrowing everybody on his way
he is working with his long paws massing everything with his chest and
laughing in thundering tones And then he disappears sinking somewhere
in the depth beneath the feet of the people There wriggling like
a snake now jumping on peoples shoulders now gliding between their
feet his godfather is working with his lean but supple and sinewy
body Here Lubov is crying and struggling following her father with
abrupt but faint movements now remaining behind him now nearing him
again Striding softly with a kind smile on her face stepping aside
from everybody and making way for everyone Aunt Anfisa is slowly
moving along Her image quivers in the darkness before Foma like the
modest flame of a wax candle And it dies out and disappears in the
darkness Pelagaya is quickly going somewhere along a straight road
There Sophya Pavlovna Medinskaya is standing her hands hanging
impotently just as she stood in her drawingroom when he saw her last
Her eyes were large but some great fright gleams in them Sasha
too is here Indifferent paying no attention to the jostling she is
stoutly going straight into the very dregs of life singing her songs
at the top of her voice her dark eyes fixed in the distance before her
Foma hears tumult howls laughter drunken shouts irritable disputes
about copeckssongs and sobs hover over this enormous restless heap of
living human bodies crowded into a pit They jump fall crawl crush
one another leap on one anothers shoulders grope everywhere like
blind people stumbling everywhere over others like themselves
struggle and falling disappear from sight Money rustles soaring
like bats over the heads of the people and the people greedily stretch
out their hands toward it the gold and silver jingles bottles rattle
corks pop someone sobs and a melancholy female voice sings

And so let us live while we can And theneen grass may cease to
grow

This wild picture fastened itself firmly in Fomas mind and growing
clearer larger and more vivid with each time it arose before him
rousing in his breast something chaotic one great indefinite feeling
into which fell like streams into a river fear and revolt and
compassion and wrath and many another thing All this boiled up within
his breast into strained desire which was thrusting it asunder into a
desire whose power was choking him and his eyes were filled with tears
he longed to shout to howl like a beast to frighten all the people
to check their senseless bustle to pour into the tumult and vanity of
their life something new his ownto tell them certain loud firm words
to guide them all into one direction and not one against another
He desired to seize them by their heads to tear them apart one from
another to thrash some to fondle others to reproach them all to
illumine them with a certain fire

There was nothing in him neither the necessary words nor the fire
all he had was the longing which was clear to him but impossible of
fulfillment He pictured himself above life outside of the deep valley
wherein people were bustling about he saw himself standing firmly on
his feet andspeechless He might have cried to the people

See how you live Arent you ashamed

And he might have abused them But if they were to ask on hearing his
voice

And how ought we to live

It was perfectly clear to him that after such a question he would have
to fly down head foremost from the heights there beneath the feet of
the throng upon the millstone And laughter would accompany him to his
destruction

Sometimes he was delirious under the pressure of this nightmare Certain
meaningless and unconnected words burst from his lips he even perspired
from this painful struggle within him At times it occurred to him that
he was going mad from intoxication and that that was the reason why
this terrible and gloomy picture was forcing itself into his mind With
a great effort of will he brushed aside these pictures and excitements
but as soon as he was alone and not very drunk he was again seized by
his delirium and again grew faint under its weight And his thirst for
freedom was growing more and more intense torturing him by its force
But tear himself away from the shackles of his wealth he could not
Mayakin who had Fomas full power of attorney to manage his affairs
acted now in such a way that Foma was bound to feel almost every day the
burden of the obligations which rested upon him People were
constantly applying to him for payments proposing to him terms for the
transportation of freight His employees overwhelmed him in person and
by letter with trifles with which he had never before concerned himself
as they used to settle these trifles at their own risk They looked for
him and found him in the taverns questioned him as to what and how
it should be done he would tell them sometimes without at all
understanding in what way this or that should be done He noticed their
concealed contempt for him and almost always saw that they did not do
the work as he had ordered but did it in a different and better way In
this he felt the clever hand of his godfather and understood that the
old man was thus pressing him in order to turn him to his way And at
the same time he noticed that he was not the master of his business
but only a component part of it and an insignificant part at that This
irritated him and moved him farther away from the old man it augumented
his longing to tear himself away from his business even at the cost of
his own ruin Infuriated he flung money about the taverns and dives
but this did not last long Yakov Tarasovich closed his accounts in the
banks withdrawing all deposits Soon Foma began to feel that even on
promissory notes they now gave him the money not quite as willingly as
before This stung his vanity and his indignation was roused and
he was frightened when he learned that his godfather had circulated a
rumour in the business world that he Foma was out of his mind and
that perhaps it might become necessary to appoint a guardian for
him Foma did not know the limits of his godfathers power and did not
venture to take anyones counsel in this matter He was convinced that
in the business world the old man was a power and that he could do
anything he pleased At first it was painful for him to feel Mayakins
hand over him but later he became reconciled to this renounced
everything and resumed his restless drunken life wherein there was
only one consolationthe people With each succeeding day he became
more and more convinced that they were more irrational and altogether
worse than hethat they were not the masters of life but its slaves
and that it was turning them around bending and breaking them at its
will while they succumbed to it unfeelingly and resignedly and none
of them but he desired freedom But he wanted it and therefore proudly
elevated himself above his drinking companions not desiring to see in
them anything but wrong

One day in a tavern a certain halfintoxicated man complained to him of
his life This was a smallsized meagre man with dim frightened eyes
unshaven in a short frock coat and with a bright necktie He blinked
pitifully his ears quivered spasmodically and his soft little voice
also trembled

Ive struggled hard to make my way among men Ive tried everything
Ive worked like a bull But life jostled me aside crushed me under
foot gave me no chance All my patience gave way Eh and so Ive taken
to drink I feel that Ill be ruined Well thats the only way open to
me

Fool said Foma with contempt Why did you want to make your way
among men You should have kept away from them to the right Standing
aside you might have seen where your place was among them and then
gone right to the point

I dont understand your words The little man shook his closecropped
angular head

Foma laughed selfsatisfied

Is it for you to understand it No do you know I think that he whom
God decreed

Not God but man arranges life Foma blurted out and was even himself
astonished at the audacity of his words And the little man glancing at
him askance also shrank timidly

Has God given you reason asked Foma recovering from his
embarrassment

Of course that is to say as much as is the share of a small man
said Fomas interlocutor irresolutely

Well and you have no right to ask of Him a single grain more Make
your own life by your own reason And God will judge you We are all in
His service And in His eyes we are all of equal value Understand

It happened very often that Foma would suddenly say something which
seemed audacious even to himself and which at the same time elevated
him in his own eyes There were certain unexpected daring thoughts
and words which suddenly flashed like sparks as though an impression
produced them from Fomas brains And he noticed more than once that
whatever he had carefully thought out beforehand was expressed by him
not quite so well and more obscure than that which suddenly flashed up
in his heart

Foma lived as though walking in a swamp in danger of sinking at each
step in the mire and slime while his godfather like a river loach
wriggled himself on a dry firm little spot vigilantly watching the
life of his godson from afar

After his quarrel with Foma Yakov Tarasovich returned home gloomy
and pensive His eyes flashed drily and he straightened himself like a
tightlystretched string His wrinkles shrank painfully his face seemed
to have become smaller and darker and when Lubov saw him in this state
it appeared to her that he was seriously ill but that he was forcing
and restraining himself Mutely and nervously the old man flung himself
about the room casting in reply to his daughters questions dry curt
words and finally shouted to her

Leave me alone You see it has nothing to do with you

She felt sorry for him when she noticed the gloomy and melancholy
expression of his keen green eyes she made it her duty to question
him as to what had happened to him and when he seated himself at
the dinnertable she suddenly approached him placed her hands on
his shoulders and looking down into his face asked him tenderly and
anxiously

Papa are you ill tell me

Her caresses were extremely rare they always softened the lonely old
man and though he did not respond to them for some reason or other he
nevertheless could not help appreciating them And now he shrugged his
shoulders thus throwing off her hands and said

Go go to your place How the itching curiosity of Eve gives you no
rest

But Lubov did not go away persistingly looking into his eyes she
asked with an offended tone in her voice

Papa why do you always speak to me in such a way as though I were a
small child or very stupid

Because you are grown up and yet not very clever Yes Thats the whole
story Go sit down and eat

She walked away and silently seated herself opposite her father
compressing her lips for affront Contrary to his habits Mayakin ate
slowly stirring his spoon in his plate of cabbagesoup for a long time
and examining the soup closely

If your obstructed mind could but comprehend your fathers thoughts
said he suddenly as he sighed with a sort of whistling sound

Lubov threw her spoon aside and almost with tears in her voice said

Why do you insult me papa You see that I am alone always alone You
understand how difficult my life is and you never say a single kind
word to me You never say anything to me And you are also lonely life
is difficult for you too I can see it You find it very hard to live
but you alone are to blame for it You alone

Now Balaams sheass has also started to talk said the old man
laughing Well what will be next

You are very proud of your wisdom papa

And what else

That isnt good and it pains me greatly Why do you repulse me You
know that save you I have no one

Tears leaped to her eyes her father noticed them and his face
quivered

If you were not a girl he exclaimed If you had as much brains as
Marfa Poosadnitza for instance Eh Lubov Then Id laugh at everybody
and at Foma Come now dont cry

She wiped her eyes and asked

What about Foma

Hes rebellious Ha ha he says Take away my property give me
freedom He wants to save his soul in the kabak Thats what entered
Fomas head

Well what is this asked Lubov irresolutely She wanted to say that
Fomas desire was good that it was a noble desire if it were earnest
but she feared to irritate her father with her words and she only gazed
at him questioningly

What is it said Mayakin excitedly trembling That either comes to
him from excessive drinking or elseHeaven forbidfrom his mother
the orthodox spirit And if this heathenish leaven is going to rise in
him Ill have to struggle hard with him There will be a great conflict
between us He has come out breast foremost against me he has at once
displayed great audacity Hes youngtheres not much cunning in him
as yet He says Ill drink away everything everything will go up in
smoke Ill show you how to drink

Mayakin lifted his hand over his head and clenching his fist
threatened furiously

How dare you Who established the business Who built it up You Your
father Forty years of labour were put into it and you wish to destroy
it We must all go to our places here all together as one man there
cautiously one by one We merchants tradesmen have for centuries
carried Russia on our shoulders and we are still carrying it Peter the
Great was a Czar of divine wisdom he knew our value How he supported
us He had printed books for the express purpose of teaching us
business There I have a book which was printed at his order by Polidor
Virgily Oorbansky about inventory printed in 1720 Yes one must
understand this He understood it and cleared the way for us And now
we stand on our own feet and we feel our place Clear the way for us
We have laid the foundation of life instead of bricks we have laid
ourselves in the earth Now we must build the stories Give us freedom
of action Thats where we must hold our course Thats where the
problem lies but Foma does not comprehend this But he must understand
it must resume the work He has his fathers means When I die mine
will be added to his Work you puppy And he is raving No wait Ill
lift you up to the proper point

The old man was choking with agitation and with flashing eyes looked at
his daughter so furiously as though Foma were sitting in her place His
agitation frightened Lubov but she lacked the courage to interrupt her
father and she looked at his stern and gloomy face in silence

The road has been paved by our fathers and you must walk on it I have
worked for fifty years to what purpose That my children may resume it
after I am gone My children Where are my children

The old man drooped his head mournfully his voice broke down and he
said sadly as if he were speaking unto himself

One is a convict utterly ruined the other a drunkard I have little
hope in him My daughter to whom then shall I leave my labour before
my death If I had but a soninlaw I thought Foma would become a man
and would be sharpened up then I would give you unto him and with you
all I havethere But Foma is good for nothing and I see no one else
in his stead What sort of people we have now In former days the
people were as of iron while now they are of indiarubber They are all
bending now And nothingthey have no firmness in them What is it Why
is it so

Mayakin looked at his daughter with alarm She was silent

Tell me he asked her what do you need How in your opinion is it
proper to live What do you want You have studied read tell me what
is it that you need

The questions fell on Lubovs head quite unexpectedly to her and she
was embarrassed She was pleased that her father asked her about this
matter and was at the same time afraid to reply lest she should
be lowered in his estimation And then gathering courage as though
preparing to jump across the table she said irresolutely and in a
trembling voice

That all the people should be happy and contented that all the people
should be equal all the people have an equal right to life to the
bliss of life all must have freedom even as they have air And
equality in everything

At the beginning of her agitated speech her father looked at her face
with anxious curiosity in his eyes but as she went on hastily hurling
her words at him his eyes assumed an altogether different expression
and finally he said to her with calm contempt

I knew it beforeyou are a gilded fool

She lowered her head but immediately raised it and exclaimed sadly

You have said so yourselffreedom

You had better hold your tongue the old man shouted at her rudely
You cannot see even that which is visibly forced outside of each man
How can all the people be happy and equal since each one wants to be
above the other Even the beggar has his pride and always boasts of
something or other before other people A small child even he wants to
be first among his playmates And one man will never yield to another
only fools believe in it Each man has his own soul and his own face
only those who love not their souls and care not for their faces can
be planed down to the same size Eh you Youve read much trash and
youve devoured it

Bitter reproach and biting contempt were expressed on the old mans
face He noisily pushed his chair away from the table jumped up and
folding his hands behind his back began to dart about in the room with
short steps shaking his head and saying something to himself in an
angry hissing whisper Lubov pale with emotion and anger feeling
herself stupid and powerless before him listening to his whisper and
her heart palpitated wildly

I am left alone alone like Job Oh Lord What shall I do Oh alone
Am I not wise Am I not clever But life has outwitted me also What
does it love Whom does it fondle It beats the good and suffers not
the bad to go unpunished and no one understands lifes justice

The girl began to feel painfully sorry for the old man she was seized
with an intense yearning to help him she longed to be of use to him

Following him with burning eyes she suddenly said in a low voice

Papa dear do not grieve Taras is still alive Perhaps he

Mayakin stopped suddenly as though nailed to the spot and he slowly
lifted his head

The tree that grew crooked in its youth and could not hold out will
certainly break when its old But nevertheless even Taras is a straw
to me now Though I doubt whether he is better than Foma Gordyeeff has
a character he has his fathers daring He can take a great deal on
himself But Taraska you recalled him just in time Yes

And the old man who a moment ago had lost his courage to the point of
complaining and griefstricken had run about the room like a mouse
in a trap now calmly and firmly walked up with a careworn face to the
table carefully adjusted his chair and seated himself saying

Well have to sound Taraska He lives in Usolye at some factory I was
told by some merchantstheyre making soda there I believe Ill find
out the particulars Ill write to him

Allow me to write to him papa begged Lubov softly flushing
trembling with joy

You asked Mayakin casting a brief glance at her he then became
silent thought awhile and said

Thats all right Thats even better Write to him Ask him whether he
isnt married how he lives what he thinks But then Ill tell you what
to write when the time has come

Do it at once papa said the girl

It is necessary to marry you off the sooner I am keeping an eye on
a certain redhaired fellow He doesnt seem to be stupid Hes been
polished abroad by the way

Is it Smolin papa asked Lubov inquisitively and anxiously

And supposing it is he what of it inquired Yakov Tarasovich in a
businesslike tone

Nothing I dont know him replied Lubov indefinitely

Well make you acquainted Its time Lubov its time Our hopes for
Foma are poor although I do not give him up

I did not reckon on Fomawhat is he to me

Thats wrong If you had been cleverer perhaps he wouldnt have gone
astray Whenever I used to see you together I thought My girl will
attract the fellow to herself That will be a fine affair But I was
wrong I thought that you would know what is to your advantage
without being told of it Thats the way my girl said the father
instructively

She became thoughtful as she listened to his impressive speech Robust
and strong Lubov was thinking of marriage more and more frequently
of late for she saw no other way out of her loneliness The desire to
forsake her father and go away somewhere in order to study something
to do something This desire she had long since overcome even as she
conquered in herself many another longing just as keen but shallow
and indefinite From the various books she had read a thick sediment
remained within her and though it was something live it had the life
of a protoplasm This sediment developed in the girl a feeling of
dissatisfaction with her life a yearning toward personal independence
a longing to be freed from the heavy guardianship of her father but she
had neither the power to realize these desires nor the clear conception
of their realization But nature had its influence on her and at the
sight of young mothers with children in their arms Lubov often felt a
sad and mournful languor within her At times stopping before the mirror
she sadly scrutinized in it her plump fresh face with dark circles
around her eyes and she felt sorry for herself She felt that life was
going past her forgetting her somewhere on the side Now listening to
her fathers words she pictured to herself what sort of man Smolin might
be She had met him when he was yet a Gymnasium student his face was
covered with freckles he was snubnosed always clean sedate and
tiresome He danced heavily awkwardly he talked uninterestingly
A long time had passed since then he had been abroad had studied
something there how was he now From Smolin her thoughts darted to
her brother and with a sinking heart she thought what would he say in
reply to her letter What sort of a man was he The image of her brother
as she had pictured it to herself prevented her from seeing both her
father and Smolin and she had already made up her mind not to consent
to marry before meeting Taras when suddenly her father shouted to her

Eh Lubovka Why are you thoughtful What are you thinking of mostly

So everything goes so swiftly replied Luba with a smile

What goes swiftly

Everything A week ago it was impossible to speak with you about Taras
while now

Tis need my girl Need is a power it bends a steel rod into a
spring And steel is stubborn Taras well see what he is Man is to
be appreciated by his resistance to the power of life if it isnt life
that wrings him but he that wrings life to suit himself my respects to
that man Allow me to shake your hand lets run our business together
Eh I am old And how very brisk life has become now With each
succeeding year there is more and more interest in it more and more
relish to it I wish I could live forever I wish I could act all the
time The old man smacked his lips rubbed his hands and his small
eyes gleamed greedily

But you are a thinblooded lot Ere you have grown up you are already
overgrown and withered You live like an old radish And the fact that
life is growing fairer and fairer is incomprehensible to you I have
lived sixtyseven years on this earth and though I am now standing
close to my grave I can see that in former years when I was young
there were fewer flowers on earth and the flowers were not quite as
beautiful as they are now Everything is growing more beautiful What
buildings we have now What different trade implements What huge
steamers A world of brains has been put into everything You look and
think what clever fellows you areOh people You merit reward and
respect Youve arranged life cleverly Everything is good everything
is pleasant Only you our successors you are devoid of all live
feelings Any little charlatan from among the commoners is cleverer than
you Take that Yozhov for instance what is he And yet he represents
himself as judge over us and even over life itselfhe has courage But
you pshaw You live like beggars In your joy you are beasts in your
misfortune vermin You are rotten They ought to inject fire into your
veins they ought to take your skin off and strew salt upon your raw
flesh then you would have jumped

Yakov Tarasovich smallsized wrinkled and bony with black broken
teeth in his mouth baldheaded and dark as though burned by the heat
of life and smoked in it trembled in vehement agitation showering
jarring words of contempt upon his daughter who was young wellgrown
and plump She looked at him with a guilty expression in her eyes
smiled confusedly and in her heart grew a greater and greater respect
for the live old man who was so steadfast in his desires

                    

And Foma went on straying and raving passing his days and nights
in taverns and dens and mastering more and more firmly his
contemptuouslyhateful bearing toward the people that surrounded him At
times they awakened in him a sad yearning to find among them some sort
of resistance to his wicked feeling to meet a worthy and courageous man
who would cause him to blush with shame by his burning reproach This
yearning became clearereach time it sprang up in him it was a longing
for assistance on the part of a man who felt that he had lost his way
and was perishing

Brethren he cried one day sitting by the table in a tavern
halfintoxicated and surrounded by certain obscure and greedy people
who ate and drank as though they had not had a piece of bread in their
mouths for many a long day before

Brethren I feel disgusted I am tired of you Beat me unmercifully
drive me away You are rascals but you are nearer to one another than
to me Why Am I not a drunkard and a rascal as well And yet I am a
stranger to you I can see I am a stranger You drink out of me and
secretly you spit upon me I can feel it Why do you do it

To be sure they could treat him in a different way In the depth of his
soul perhaps not one of them considered himself lower than Foma but he
was rich and this hindered them from treating him more as a companion
and then he always spoke certain comically wrathful consciencerending
words and this embarrassed them Moreover he was strong and ready to
fight and they dared not say a word against him And that was just what
he wanted He wished more and more intensely that one of these people
he despised would stand up against him face to face and would tell
him something strong which like a lever would turn him aside from the
sloping road whose danger he felt and whose filth he saw being filled
with helpless aversion for it

And Foma found what he needed

One day irritated by the lack of attention for him he cried to his
drinkingcompanions

You boys keep quiet every one of you Who gives you to drink and to
eat Have you forgotten it Ill bring you in order Ill show you how
to respect me Convicts When I speak you must all keep quiet

And indeed all became silent either for fear lest they might lose his
good will or perhaps afraid that he that healthy and strong beast
might beat them They sat in silence about a minute concealing their
anger at him bending over the plates and attempting to hide from him
their fright and embarrassment Foma measured them with a selfsatisfied
look and gratified by their slavish submissiveness said boastfully

Ah Youve grown dumb now thats the way I am strict I

You sluggard came some ones calm loud exclamation

Whaat roared Foma jumping up from his chair Who said that

Then a certain strange shabbylooking man arose at the end of the
table he was tall in a long frockcoat with a heap of grayish hair
on his large head His hair was stiff standing out in all directions in
thick locks his face was yellow unshaven with a long crooked nose
To Foma it seemed that he resembled a swab with which the steamer decks
are washed and this amused the halfintoxicated fellow

How fine said he sarcastically What are you snarling at eh Do
you know who I am

With the gesture of a tragic actor the man stretched out to Foma his
hand with its long pliant fingers like those of a juggler and he said
in a deep hoarse basso

You are the rotten disease of your father who though he was a
plunderer was nevertheless a worthy man in comparison with you

Because of the unexpectedness of this and because of his wrath Fomas
heart shrank He fiercely opened his eyes wide and kept silent finding
no words to reply to this insolence And the man standing before him
went on hoarsely with animation beastlike rolling his large but dim
and swollen eyes

You demand of us respect for you you fool How have you merited it
Who are you A drunkard drinking away the fortune of your father You
savage You ought to be proud that I a renowned artist a disinterested
and faithful worshipper at the shrine of art drink from the same
bottle with you This bottle contains sandal and molasses infused with
snufftobacco while you think it is port wine It is your license for
the name of savage and ass

Eh you jailbird roared Foma rushing toward the artist But he was
seized and held back Struggling in the arms of those that seized him
he was compelled to listen without replying to the thundering deep and
heavy bass of the man who resembled a swab

You have thrown to men a few copecks out of the stolen roubles and
you consider yourself a hero You are twice a thief You have stolen the
roubles and now you are stealing gratitude for your few copecks But
I shall not give it to you I who have devoted all my life to the
condemnation of vice I stand before you and say openly You are a fool
and a beggar because you are too rich Here lies the wisdom all the
rich are beggars Thats how the famous coupletist RimskyKannibalsky
serves Truth

Foma was now standing meekly among the people that had closely
surrounded him and he eagerly listened to the coupletists thundering
words which now aroused in him a sensation as though somebody was
scratching a sore spot and thus soothing the acute itching of the pain
The people were excited some attempted to check the coupletists flow
of eloquence others wanted to lead Foma away somewhere Without saying
a word he pushed them aside and listened more and more absorbed by the
intense pleasure of humiliation which he felt in the presence of these
people The pain irritated by the words of the coupletist caressed
Fomas soul more and more passionately and the coupletist went on
thundering intoxicated with the impurity of his accusation

You think that you are the master of life You are the low slave of the
rouble

Someone in the crowd hiccoughed and evidently displeased with himself
for this cursed each time he hiccoughed

Oh devil

And a certain unshaven fatfaced man took pity on Foma or perhaps
became tired of witnessing that scene and waving his hands he drawled
out plaintively

Gentlemen drop that It isnt good For we are all sinners Decidedly
all believe me

Well speak on muttered Foma Say everything I wont touch you

The mirrors on the walls reflected this drunken confusion and the
people as reflected in the mirrors seemed more disgusting and hideous
than they were in reality

I do not want to speak exclaimed the coupletist I do not want to
cast the pearls of truth and of my wrath before you

He rushed forward and raising his head majestically turned toward the
door with tragic footsteps

You lie said Foma attempting to follow him Hold on you have made
me agitated now calm me

They seized him surrounded him and shouted something to him while
he was rushing forward overturning everybody When he met tactile
obstacles on his way the struggle with them gave him ease uniting all
his riotous feelings into one yearning to overthrow that which hindered
him And now after he had jostled them all aside and rushed out into
the street he was already less agitated Standing on the sidewalk he
looked about the street and thought with shame

How could I permit that swab to mock me and abuse my father as a
thief

It was dark and quiet about him the moon was shining brightly and
a light refreshing breeze was blowing Foma held his face to the cool
breeze as he walked against the wind with rapid strides timidly looking
about on all sides and wishing that none of the company from the tavern
would follow him He understood that he had lowered himself in the eyes
of all these people As he walked he thought of what he had come to a
sharper had publicly abused him in disgraceful terms while he the
son of a wellknown merchant had not been able to repay him for his
mocking

It serves me right thought Foma sadly and bitterly That serves
me right Dont lose your head understand And then again I wanted
it myself I interfered with everybody so now take your share These
thoughts made him feel painfully sorry for himself Seized and sobered
by them he kept on strolling along the streets and searching for
something strong and firm in himself But everything within him was
confused it merely oppressed his heart without assuming any definite
forms As in a painful dream he reached the river seated himself on the
beams by the shore and began to look at the calm dark water which was
covered with tiny ripples Calmly and almost noiselessly flowed on the
broad mighty river carrying enormous weights upon its bosom The river
was all covered with black vessels the signal lights and the stars were
reflected in its water the tiny ripples murmuring softly were
gently breaking against the shore at the very feet of Foma Sadness was
breathed down from the sky the feeling of loneliness oppressed Foma

Oh Lord Jesus Christ thought he sadly gazing at the sky What a
failure I am There is nothing in me God has put nothing into me Of
what use am I Oh Lord Jesus

At the recollection of Christ Foma felt somewhat betterhis loneliness
seemed alleviated and heaving a deep sigh he began to address God in
silence

Oh Lord Jesus Christ Other people do not understand anything either
but they think that all is known to them and therefore it is easier for
them to live While II have no justification Here it is night and I
am alone I have no place to go I am unable to say anything to anybody
I love no oneonly my godfather and he is soulless If Thou hadst but
punished him somehow He thinks there is none cleverer and better on
earth than himself While Thou sufferest it And the same with me If
some misfortune were but sent to me If some illness were to overtake
me But here I am as strong as iron I am drinking leading a gay life
I live in filth but the body does not even rust and only my soul
aches Oh Lord To what purpose is such a life

Vague thoughts of protest flashed one after another through the mind
of the lonely straying man while the silence about him was growing
deeper and night ever darker and darker Not far from the shore lay a
boat at anchor it rocked from side to side and something was creaking
in it as though moaning

How am I to free myself from such a life as this reflected Foma
staring at the boat And what occupation is destined to be mine
Everybody is working

And suddenly he was struck by a thought which appeared great to him

And hard work is cheaper than easy work Some man will give himself up
entire to his work for a rouble while another takes a thousand with one
finger

He was pleasantly roused by this thought It seemed to him that he
discovered another falsehood in the life of man another fraud which
they conceal He recalled one of his stokers the old man Ilya who
for ten copecks used to be on watch at the fireplace out of his turn
working for a comrade eight hours in succession amid suffocating heat
One day when he had fallen sick on account of overwork he was lying on
the bow of the steamer and when Foma asked him why he was thus ruining
himself Ilya replied roughly and sternly

Because every copeck is more necessary to me than a hundred roubles to
you Thats why

And saying this the old man turned his body which was burning with
pain with its back to Foma

Reflecting on the stoker his thoughts suddenly and without any effort
embraced all those petty people that were doing hard work He wondered
Why do they live What pleasure is it for them to live on earth They
constantly do but their dirty hard work they eat poorly are poorly
clad they drink One man is sixty years old and yet he keeps on
toiling side by side with the young fellows And they all appeared to
Foma as a huge pile of worms which battled about on earth just to
get something to eat In his memory sprang up his meetings with these
people one after anothertheir remarks about lifenow sarcastic and
mournful now hopelessly gloomy remarkstheir wailing songs And now he
also recalled how one day in the office Yefim had said to the clerk who
hired the sailors

Some Lopukhin peasants have come here to hire themselves out so dont
give them more than ten roubles a month Their place was burned down to
ashes last summer and they are now in dire needtheyll work for ten
roubles

Sitting on the beams Foma rocked his whole body to and fro and out of
the darkness from the river various human figures appeared silently
before himsailors stokers clerks waiters halfintoxicated painted
women and tavernloungers They floated in the air like shadows
something damp and brackish came from them and the dark dense throng
moved on slowly noiselessly and swiftly like clouds in an autumn sky
The soft splashing of the waves poured into his soul like sadly sighing
music Far away somewhere on the other bank of the river burned a
woodpile embraced by the darkness on all sides it was at times almost
absorbed by it and in the darkness it trembled a reddish spot scarcely
visible to the eye But now the fire flamed up again the darkness
receded and it was evident that the flame was striving upward And then
it sank again

Oh Lord Oh Lord thought Foma painfully and bitterly feeling that
grief was oppressing his heart with ever greater power Here I am
alone even as that fire Only no light comes from me nothing but fumes
and smoke If I could only meet a wise man Someone to speak to It is
utterly impossible for me to live alone I cannot do anything I wish I
might meet a man

Far away on the river two large purple fires appeared and high above
them was a third A dull noise resounded in the distance something
black was moving toward Foma

A steamer going up stream he thought There may be more than a
hundred people aboard and none of them give a single thought to me
They all know whither they are sailing Every one of them has something
that is his own Every one I believe understands what he wants But
what do I want And who will tell it to me Where is such a man

The lights of the steamer were reflected in the river quivering in
it the illumined water rushed away from it with a dull murmur and the
steamer looked like a huge black fish with fins of fire

A few days elapsed after this painful night and Foma caroused again It
came about by accident and against his will He had made up his mind to
restrain himself from drinking and so went to dinner in one of the
most expensive hotels in town hoping to find there none of his
familiar drinkingcompanions who always selected the cheaper and less
respectable places for their drinking bouts But his calculation proved
to be wrong he at once came into the friendly joyous embrace of the
brandydistillers son who had taken Sasha as mistress

He ran up to Foma embraced him and burst into merry laughter

Heres a meeting This is the third day I have eaten here and I am
wearied by this terrible lonesomeness There is not a decent man in the
whole town so I have had to strike up an acquaintance with newspaper
men Theyre a gay lot although at first they played the aristocrat and
kept sneering at me After awhile we all got dead drunk Theyll be here
again todayI swear by the fortune of my father Ill introduce you to
them There is one writer of feuilletons here you know that some one
who always lauded you whats his name An amusing fellow the devil
take him Do you know it would be a good thing to hire one like that for
personal use Give him a certain sum of money and order him to amuse
Hows that I had a certain coupletist in my employit was rather
entertaining to be with him I used to say to him sometimes Rimsky
give us some couplets He would start I tell you and hed make you
split your sides with laughter Its a pity he ran off somewhere Have
you had dinner

Not yet And hows Aleksandra asked Foma somewhat deafened by the
loud speech of this tall frank redfaced fellow clad in a motley
costume

Well do you know said the latter with a frown that Aleksandra of
yours is a nasty woman Shes so obscure its tiresome to be with her
the devil take her Shes as cold as a frogbrrr I guess Ill send
her away

Coldthats true said Foma and became pensive Every person must
do his work in a first class manner said the distillers son
instructively And if you become some ones s mistress you must perform
your duty in the best way possible if you are a decent woman Well
shall we have a drink

They had a drink And naturally they got drunk A large and noisy
company gathered in the hotel toward evening And Foma intoxicated but
sad and calm spoke to them with heavy voice

Thats the way I understand it some people are worms others sparrows
The sparrows are the merchants They peck the worms Such is their
destined lot They are necessary But I and youall of youare to no
purpose We live so that we cannot be compared to anythingwithout
justification merely at random And we are utterly unnecessary But
even these here and everybody else to what purpose are they You must
understand that Brethren We shall all burst By God And why shall
we burst Because there is always something superfluous in us there
is something superfluous in our souls And all our life is superfluous
Comrades I weep To what purpose am I I am unnecessary Kill me that
I may die I want to die

And he wept shedding many drunken tears A drunken smallsized
swarthy man sat down close to him began to remind him of something
tried to kiss him and striking a knife against the table shouted

True Silence These are powerful words Let the elephants and the
mammoths of the disorder of life speak The raw Russian conscience
speaks holy words Roar on Gordyeeff Roar at everything And again
he clutched at Fomas shoulders flung himself on his breast raising
to Fomas face his round black closelycropped head which was
ceaselessly turning about on his shoulders on all sides so that Foma
was unable to see his face and he was angry at him for this and kept
on pushing him aside crying excitedly

Get away Where is your face Go on

A deafening drunken laughter smote the air about them and choking with
laughter the son of the brandydistiller roared to someone hoarsely

Come to me A hundred roubles a month with board and lodging Throw the
paper to the dogs Ill give you more

And everything rocked from side to side in rhythmic wavelike movement
Now the people moved farther away from Foma now they came nearer to
him the ceiling descended the floor rose and it seemed to Foma that
he would soon be flattened and crushed Then he began to feel that he
was floating somewhere over an immensely wide and stormy river and
staggering he cried out in fright

Where are we floating Where is the captain

He was answered by the loud senseless laughter of the drunken crowd
and by the shrill repulsive shout of the swarthy little man

True we are all without helm and sails Where is the captain What
Ha ha ha

Foma awakened from this nightmare in a small room with two windows and
the first thing his eyes fell upon was a withered tree It stood near
the window its thick trunk barkless with a rotten heart prevented
the light from entering the room the bent black branches devoid of
leaves stretched themselves mournfully and helplessly in the air
and shaking to and fro they creaked softly plaintively A rain was
falling streams of water were beating against the windowpanes and
one could hear how the water was falling to the ground from the roof
sobbing there This sobbing sound was joined by another sounda shrill
often interrupted hasty scratching of a pen over paper and then by a
certain spasmodic grumbling

When he turned with difficulty his aching heavy head on the pillow
Foma noticed a small swarthy man who sat by the table hastily
scratching with his pen over the paper shaking his round head
approvingly wagging it from side to side shrugging his shoulders
and with all his small body clothed in night garments only constantly
moving about in his chair as though he were sitting on fire and could
not get up for some reason or other His left hand lean and thin was
now firmly rubbing his forehead now making certain incomprehensible
signs in the air his bare feet scraped along the floor a certain vein
quivered on his neck and even his ears were moving When he turned
toward Foma Foma saw his thin lips whispering something his
sharppointed nose turned down to his thin moustache which twitched
upward each time the little man smiled His face was yellow bloated
wrinkled and his black vivacious small sparkling eyes did not seem to
belong to him

Having grown tired of looking at him Foma slowly began to examine the
room with his eyes On the large nails driven into the walls hung
piles of newspapers which made the walls look as though covered with
swellings The ceiling was pasted with paper which had been white once
upon a time now it was puffed up like bladders torn here and there
peeled off and hanging in dirty scraps clothing boots books torn
pieces of paper lay scattered on the floor Altogether the room gave one
the impression that it had been scalded with boiling water

The little man dropped the pen bent over the table drummed briskly on
its edge with his fingers and began to sing softly in a faint voice

Take the drum and fear notAnd kiss the sutler girl aloudThats the
sense of learningAnd thats philosophy

Foma heaved a deed sigh and said

May I have some seltzer

Ah exclaimed the little man and jumping up from his chair appeared
at the wide oilclothcovered lounge where Foma lay How do you do
comrade Seltzer Of course With cognac or plain

Better with cognac said Foma shaking the lean burning hand which
was outstretched to him and staring fixedly into the face of the little
man

Yegorovna cried the latter at the door and turning to Foma asked
Dont you recognise me Foma Ignatyevich

I remember something It seems to me we had met somewhere before

That meeting lasted for four years but that was long ago Yozhov

Oh Lord exclaimed Foma in astonishment slightly rising from the
lounge Is it possible that it is you

There are times dear when I dont believe it myself but a real fact
is something from which doubt jumps back as a rubber ball from iron

Yozhovs face was comically distorted and for some reason or other his
hands began to feel his breast

Well well drawled out Foma But how old you have grown Ahah How
old are you

Thirty

And you look as though you were fifty lean yellow Life isnt sweet
to you it seems And you are drinking too I see

Foma felt sorry to see his jolly and brisk schoolmate so worn out
and living in this doghole which seemed to be swollen from burns He
looked at him winked his eyes mournfully and saw that Yozhovs face
was for ever twitching and his small eyes were burning with irritation
Yozhov was trying to uncork the bottle of water and thus occupied was
silent he pressed the bottle between his knees and made vain efforts to
take out the cork And his impotence moved Foma

Yes life has sucked you dry And you have studied Even science seems
to help man but little said Gordyeeff plaintively

Drink said Yozhov turning pale with fatigue and handing him the
glass Then he wiped his forehead seated himself on the lounge beside
Foma and said

Leave science alone Science is a drink of the gods but it has not yet
fermented sufficiently and therefore is not fit for use like vodka
which has not yet been purified from empyreumatic oil Science is not
ready for mans happiness my friend And those living people that use
it get nothing but headaches Like those you and I have at present Why
do you drink so rashly

I What else am I to do asked Foma laughing Yozhov looked at Foma
searchingly with his eyes half closed and he said

Connecting your question with everything you jabbered last night I
feel within my troubled soul that you too my friend do not amuse
yourself because life is cheerful to you

Eh sighed Foma heavily rising from the lounge What is my life
It is something meaningless I live alone I understand nothing And yet
there is something I long for I yearn to spit on all and then disappear
somewhere I would like to run away from everything I am so weary

Thats interesting said Yozhov rubbing his hands and turning about
in all directions This is interesting if it is true and deep for
it shows that the holy spirit of dissatisfaction with life has already
penetrated into the bed chambers of the merchants into the death
chambers of souls drowned in fat cabbage soup in lakes of tea and other
liquids Give me a circumstantial account of it Then my dear I shall
write a novel

I have been told that you have already written something about me
inquired Foma with curiosity and once more attentively scrutinized his
old friend unable to understand what so wretched a creature could write

Of course I have Did you read it

No I did not have the chance

And what have they told you

That you gave me a clever scolding

Hm And doesnt it interest you to read it yourself inquired Yozhov
scrutinizing Gordyeeff closely

Ill read it Foma assured him feeling embarrassed before Yozhov and
that Yozhov was offended by such regard for his writings Indeed it is
interesting since it is about myself he added smiling kindheartedly
at his comrade

In saying this he was not at all interested and he said it merely out
of pity for Yozhov There was quite another feeling in him he wished to
know what sort of a man Yozhov was and why he had become so worn
out This meeting with Yozhov gave rise in him to a tranquil and kind
feeling it called forth recollections of his childhood and these
flashed now in his memoryflashed like modest little lights timidly
shining at him from the distance of the past Yozhov walked up to the
table on which stood a boiling samovar silently poured out two glasses
of tea as strong as tar and said to Foma

Come and drink tea And tell me about yourself

I have nothing to tell you I have not seen anything in life Mine is
an empty life You had better tell me about yourself I am sure you know
more than I do at any rate

Yozhov became thoughtful not ceasing to turn his whole body and to
waggle his head In thoughtfulness his face became motionless all its
wrinkles gathered near his eyes and seemed to surround them with rays
and because of this his eyes receded deeper under his forehead

Yes my dear I have seen a thing or two and I know a great deal he
began with a shake of the head And perhaps I know even more than it
is necessary for me to know and to know more than it is necessary is
just as harmful to man as it is to be ignorant of what it is essential
to know Shall I tell you how I have lived Very well that is Ill
try I have never told any one about myself because I have never
aroused interest in anyone It is most offensive to live on earth
without arousing peoples interest in you

I can see by your face and by everything else that your life has not
been a smooth one said Foma feeling pleased with the fact that to
all appearances life was not sweet to his comrade as well Yozhov drank
his tea at one draught thrust the glass on the saucer placed his feet
on the edge of the chair and clasping his knees in his hands rested
his chin upon them In this pose small sized and flexible as rubber he
began

The student Sachkov my former teacher who is now a doctor of
medicine a whistplayer and a mean fellow all around used to tell me
whenever I knew my lesson well Youre a fine fellow Kolya You are
an able boy We proletariats plain and poor people coming from the
backyard of life we must study and study in order to come to the
front ahead of everybody Russia is in need of wise and honest people
Try to be such and you will be master of your fate and a useful member
of society On us commoners rest the best hopes of the country We are
destined to bring into it light truth and so on I believed him the
brute And since then about twenty years have elapsed We proletariats
have grown up but have neither appropriated any wisdom nor brought
light into life As before Russia is still suffering from its chronic
diseasea superabundance of rascals while we the proletariats take
pleasure in filling their dense throngs My teacher I repeat is a
lackey a characterless and dumb creature who must obey the orders of
the mayor While I am a clown in the employ of society Fame pursues me
here in town dear I walk along the street and I hear one driver say to
another There goes Yozhov How cleverly he barks the deuce take him
Yes Even this cannot be so easily attained

Yozhovs face wrinkled into a bitter grimace and he began to laugh
noiselessly with his lips only Foma did not understand his words and
just to say something he remarked at random

You didnt hit then what you aimed at

Yes I thought I would grow up higher And so I should So I should I
say

He jumped up from his chair and began to run about in the room
exclaiming briskly in a shrill voice

But to preserve ones self pure for life and to be a free man in it
one must have vast powers I had them I had elasticity cleverness
I have spent all these in order to learn something which is absolutely
unnecessary to me now I have wasted the whole of myself in order to
preserve something within myself Oh devil I myself and many others
with me we have all robbed ourselves for the sake of saving up
something for life Just think of it desiring to make of myself a
valuable man I have underrated my individuality in every way possible
In order to study and not die of starvation I have for six years in
succession taught blockheads how to read and write and had to bear
a mass of abominations at the hands of various papas and mammas who
humiliated me without any constraint Earning my bread and tea I
could not I had not the time to earn my shoes and I had to turn to
charitable institutions with humble petitions for loans on the strength
of my poverty If the philanthropists could only reckon up how much of
the spirit they kill in man while supporting the life of his body If
they only knew that each rouble they give for bread contains ninetynine
copecks worth of poison for the soul If they could only burst from
excess of their kindness and pride which they draw from their holy
activity There is none on earth more disgusting and repulsive than he
who gives alms even as there is none more miserable than he who accepts
it

Yozhov staggered about in the room like a drunken man seized with
madness and the paper under his feet was rustling tearing flying in
scraps He gnashed his teeth shook his head his hands waved in the air
like broken wings of a bird and altogether it seemed as though he
were being boiled in a kettle of hot water Foma looked at him with a
strange mixed sensation he pitied Yozhov and at the same time he was
pleased to see him suffering

I am not alone he is suffering too thought Foma as Yozhov spoke
And something clashed in Yozhovs throat like broken glass and creaked
like an unoiled hinge

Poisoned by the kindness of men I was ruined through the fatal
capacity of every poor fellow during the making of his career through
the capacity of being reconciled with little in the expectation of
much Oh Do you know more people perish through lack of proper
selfappreciation than from consumption and perhaps that is why the
leaders of the masses serve as district inspectors

The devil take the district inspectors said Foma with a wave of the
hand Tell me about yourself

About myself I am here entire exclaimed Yozhov stopping short in
the middle of the room and striking his chest with his hands I have
already accomplished all I could accomplish I have attained the rank of
the publics entertainerand that is all I can do To know what should
be done and not to be able to do it not to have the strength for your
workthat is torture

Thats it Wait awhile said Foma enthusiastically Now tell me what
one should do in order to live calmly that is in order to be satisfied
with ones self

To Foma these words sounded loud but empty and their sounds died away
without stirring any emotion in his heart without giving rise to a
single thought in his mind

You must always be in love with something unattainable to you A man
grows in height by stretching himself upwards

Now that he had ceased speaking of himself Yozhov began to talk more
calmly in a different voice His voice was firm and resolute and his
face assumed an expression of importance and sternness He stood in the
centre of the room his hand with outstretched fingers uplifted and
spoke as though he were reading

Men are base because they strive for satiety The wellfed man is an
animal because satiety is the selfcontentedness of the body And the
selfcontentedness of the spirit also turns man into animal

Again he started as though all his veins and muscles were suddenly
strained and again he began to run about the room in seething
agitation

A selfcontented man is the hardened swelling on the breast of society
He is my sworn enemy He fills himself up with cheap truths with gnawed
morsels of musty wisdom and he exists like a storeroom where a stingy
housewife keeps all sorts of rubbish which is absolutely unnecessary to
her and worthless If you touch such a man if you open the door into
him the stench of decay will be breathed upon you and a stream of some
musty trash will be poured into the air you breathe These unfortunate
people call themselves men of firm character men of principles and
convictions And no one cares to see that convictions are to them but
the clothes with which they cover the beggarly nakedness of their souls
On the narrow brows of such people there always shines the inscription
so familiar to all calmness and confidence What a false inscription
Just rub their foreheads with firm hand and then you will see the real
signboard which reads Narrow mindedness and weakness of soul

Foma watched Yozhov bustling about the room and thought mournfully

Whom is he abusing I cant understand but I can see that he has been
terribly wounded

How many such people have I seen exclaimed Yozhov with wrath and
terror How these little retail shops have multiplied in life In
them you will find calico for shrouds and tar candy and borax for the
extermination of cockroaches but you will not find anything fresh hot
wholesome You come to them with an aching soul exhausted by loneliness
you come thirsting to hear something that has life in it And they
offer to you some worm cud ruminated bookthoughts grown sour with
age And these dry stale thoughts are always so poor that in order
to give them expression it is necessary to use a vast number of
highsounding and empty words When such a man speaks I say to myself
There goes a wellfed but overwatered mare all decorated with bells
shes carting a load of rubbish out of the town and the miserable
wretch is content with her fate

They are superfluous people then said Foma Yozhov stopped short in
front of him and said with a biting smile on his lips

No they are not superfluous oh no They exist as an example to show
what man ought not to be Speaking frankly their proper place is
the anatomical museums where they preserve all sorts of monsters and
various sickly deviations from the normal In life there is nothing that
is superfluous dear Even I am necessary Only those people in whose
souls dwells a slavish cowardice before life in whose bosoms there are
enormous ulcers of the most abominable selfadoration taking the places
of their dead heartsonly those people are superfluous but even they
are necessary if only for the sake of enabling me to pour my hatred
upon them

All day long until evening Yozhov was excited venting his blasphemy
on men he hated and his words though their contents were obscure to
Foma infected him with their evil heat and infecting called forth in
him an eager desire for combat At times there sprang up in him distrust
of Yozhov and in one of these moments he asked him plainly

Well And can you speak like that in the face of men

I do it at every convenient occasion And every Sunday in the
newspaper Ill read some to you if you like

Without waiting for Fomas reply he tore down from the wall a few
sheets of paper and still continuing to run about the room began to
read to him He roared squeaked laughed showed his teeth and looked
like an angry dog trying to break the chain in powerless rage Not
grasping the ideals in his friends creations Foma felt their daring
audacity their biting sarcasm their passionate malice and he was as
well pleased with them as though he had been scourged with besoms in a
hot bath

Clever he exclaimed catching some separate phrase Thats cleverly
aimed

Every now and again there flashed before him the familiar names of
merchants and wellknown citizens whom Yozhov had stung now stoutly
and sharply now respectfully and with a fine needlelike sting

Fomas approbation his eyes burning with satisfaction and his excited
face gave Yozhov still more inspiration and he cried and roared ever
louder and louder now falling on the lounge from exhaustion now
jumping up again and rushing toward Foma

Come now read about me exclaimed Foma longing to hear it Yozhov
rummaged among a pile of papers tore out one sheet and holding it
in both hands stopped in front of Foma with his legs straddled wide
apart while Foma leaned back in the brokenseated armchair and listened
with a smile

The notice about Foma started with a description of the spree on the
rafts and during the reading of the notice Foma felt that certain
particular words stung him like mosquitoes His face became more
serious and he bent his head in gloomy silence And the mosquitoes went
on multiplying

Now thats too much said he at length confused and dissatisfied
Surely you cannot gain the favour of God merely because you know how to
disgrace a man

Keep quiet Wait awhile said Yozhov curtly and went on reading

Having established in his article that the merchant rises beyond doubt
above the representatives of other classes of society in the matter
of nuisance and scandalmaking Yozhov asked Why is this so and
replied

It seems to me that this predilection for wild pranks comes from the
lack of culture in so far as it is dependent upon the excess of energy
and upon idleness There cannot be any doubt that our merchant class
with but few exceptions is the healthiest and at the same time most
inactive class

Thats true exclaimed Foma striking the table with his fist Thats
true I have the strength of a bull and do the work of a sparrow

Where is the merchant to spend his energy He cannot spend much of it
on the Exchange so he squanders the excess of his muscular capital in
drinkingbouts in kabaky for he has no conception of other applications
of his strength which are more productive more valuable to life He is
still a beast and life has already become to him a cage and it is
too narrow for him with his splendid health and predilection for
licentiousness Hampered by culture he at once starts to lead a
dissolute life The debauch of a merchant is always the revolt of a
captive beast Of course this is bad But ah it will be worse yet
when this beast in addition to his strength shall have gathered some
sense and shall have disciplined it Believe me even then he will not
cease to create scandals but they will be historical events Heaven
deliver us from such events For they will emanate from the merchants
thirst for power their aim will be the omnipotence of one class
and the merchant will not be particular about the means toward the
attainment of this aim

Well what do you say is it true asked Yozhov when he had finished
reading the newspaper and thrown it aside

I dont understand the end replied Foma And as to strength that is
true Where am I to make use of my strength since there is no demand for
it I ought to fight with robbers or turn a robber myself In general
I ought to do something big And that should be done not with the
head but with the arms and the breast While here we have to go to the
Exchange and try to aim well to make a rouble What do we need it for
And what is it anyway Has life been arranged in this form forever
What sort of life is it if everyone is grieved and finds it too narrow
for him Life ought to be according to the taste of man If it is narrow
for me I must move it asunder that I may have more room I must break
it and reconstruct it But nod Thats where the trouble lies What
ought to be done that life may be freer That I do not understand and
thats all there is to it

Yes drawled out Yozhov So thats where youve gone That dear is
a good thing Ah you ought to study a little How are you about books
Do you read any

No I dont care for them I havent read any

Thats just why you dont care for them I am even afraid to read
them I know onea certain girlits worse than drinking with her And
what sense is there in books One man imagines something and prints it
and others read it If it is interesting its all right But learn from
a book how to livethat is something absurd It was written by man
not by God and what laws and examples can man establish for himself

And how about the Gospels Were they not written by men

Those were apostles Now there are none

Good your refutation is sound It is true dear there are no
apostles Only the Judases remained and miserable ones at that

Foma felt very well for he saw that Yozhov was attentively listening
to his words and seemed to be weighing each and every word he uttered
Meeting such bearing toward him for the first time in his life Foma
unburdened himself boldly and freely before his friend caring nothing
for the choice of words and feeling that he would be understood because
Yozhov wanted to understand him

You are a curious fellow said Yozhov about two days after their
meeting And though you speak with difficulty one feels that there is
a great deal in yougreat daring of heart If you only knew a little
about the order of life Then you would speak loud enough I think
Yes

But you cannot wash yourself clean with words nor can you then free
yourself remarked Foma with a sigh You have said something about
people who pretend that they know everything and can do everything I
also know such people My godfather for instance It would be a
good thing to set out against them to convict them theyre a pretty
dangerous set

I cannot imagine Foma how you will get along in life if you preserve
within you that which you now have said Yozhov thoughtfully

Its very hard I lack steadfastness Of a sudden I could perhaps do
something I understand very well that life is difficult and narrow for
every one of us I know that my godfather sees that too But he profits
by this narrowness He feels well in it he is sharp as a needle and
hell make his way wherever he pleases But I am a big heavy man
thats why I am suffocating Thats why I live in fetters I could free
myself from everything with a single effort just to move my body with
all my strength and then all the fetters will burst

And what then asked Yozhov

Then Foma became pensive and after a moments thought waved his
hand I dont know what will be then I shall see

We shall see assented Yozhov

He was given to drink this little man who was scalded by life His
day began thus in the morning at his tea he looked over the local
newspapers and drew from the news notices material for his feuilleton
which he wrote right then and there on the corner of the table Then he
ran to the editorial office where he made up Provincial Pictures
out of clippings from country newspapers On Friday he had to write
his Sunday feuilleton For all they paid him a hundred and twentyfive
roubles a month he worked fast and devoted all his leisure time to
the survey and study of charitable institutions Together with Foma he
strolled about the clubs hotels and taverns till late at night drawing
material everywhere for his articles which he called brushes for
the cleansing of the conscience of society The censor he styled as
superintendent of the diffusion of truth and righteousness in life the
newspaper he called the gobetween engaged in introducing the reader
to dangerous ideas and his own work the sale of a soul in retail
and an inclination to audacity against holy institutions

Foma could hardly make out when Yozhov jested and when he was in
earnest He spoke of everything enthusiastically and passionately he
condemned everything harshly and Foma liked it But often beginning to
argue enthusiastically he refuted and contradicted himself with equal
enthusiasm or wound up his speech with some ridiculous turn Then it
appeared to Foma that that man loved nothing that nothing was firmly
rooted within him that nothing guided him Only when speaking of
himself he talked in a rather peculiar voice and the more impassioned
he was in speaking of himself the more merciless and enraged was he
in reviling everything and everybody And his relation toward Foma was
dual sometimes he gave him courage and spoke to him hotly quivering in
every limb

Go ahead Refute and overthrow everything you can Push forward with
all your might There is nothing more valuable than man know this Cry
at the top of your voice Freedom Freedom

But when Foma warmed up by the glowing sparks of these words began to
dream of how he should start to refute and overthrow people who for the
sake of personal profit do not want to broaden life Yozhov would often
cut him short

Drop it You cannot do anything People like you are not needed Your
time the time of the strong but not clever is past my dear You are
too late There is no place for you in life

No You are lying cried Foma irritated by contradiction

Well what can you accomplish

I

You

Why I can kill you said Foma angrily clenching his fist

Eh you scarecrow said Yozhov convincingly and pitifully with a
shrug of the shoulder Is there anything in that Why I am anyway half
dead already from my wounds

And suddenly inflamed with melancholy malice he stretched himself and
said

My fate has wronged me Why have I lowered myself accepting the sops
of the public Why have I worked like a machine for twelve years in
succession in order to study Why have I swallowed for twelve long years
in the Gymnasium and the University the dry and tedious trash and the
contradictory nonsense which is absolutely useless to me In order
to become feuilletonwriter to play the clown from day to day
entertaining the public and convincing myself that that is necessary and
useful to them Where is the powder of my youth I have fired off
all the charge of my soul at three copecks a shot What faith have I
acquired for myself Only faith in the fact that everything in this life
is worthless that everything must be broken destroyed What do I love
Myself And I feel that the object of my love does not deserve my love
What can I accomplish

He almost wept and kept on scratching his breast and his neck with his
thin feeble hands

But sometimes he was seized with a flow of courage and then he spoke in
a different spirit

I Oh no my song is not yet sung to the end My breast has imbibed
something and Ill hiss like a whip Wait Ill drop the newspaper
Ill start to do serious work and write one small book which I will
entitle The Passing of the Soul there is a prayer by that name it
is read for the dying And before its death this society cursed by the
anathema of inward impotence will receive my book like incense

Listening to each and every word of his watching him and comparing his
remarks Foma saw that Yozhov was just as weak as he was that he too
had lost his way But Yozhovs mood still infected Foma his speeches
enriched Fomas vocabulary and sometimes he noticed with joyous delight
how cleverly and forcibly he had himself expressed this or that idea He
often met in Yozhovs house certain peculiar people who it seemed to
him knew everything understood everything contradicted everything
and saw deceit and falsehood in everything He watched them in silence
listened to their words their audacity pleased him but he was
embarrassed and repelled by their condescending and haughty bearing
toward him And then he clearly saw that in Yozhovs room they were all
cleverer and better than they were in the street and in the hotels They
held peculiar conversations words and gestures for use in the room
and all this was changed outside the room into the most commonplace and
human Sometimes in the room they all blazed up like a huge woodpile
and Yozhov was the brightest firebrand among them but the light of this
bonfire illuminated but faintly the obscurity of Foma Gordyeeffs soul

One day Yozhov said to him

Today we will carouse Our compositors have formed a union and they
are going to take all the work from the publisher on a contract There
will be some drinking on this account and I am invited It was I who
advised them to do it Let us go You will give them a good treat

Very well said Foma to whom it was immaterial with whom he passed
the time which was a burden to him

In the evening of that day Foma and Yozhov sat in the company of
roughfaced people on the outskirts of a grove outside the town
There were twelve compositors there neatly dressed they treated Yozhov
simply as a comrade and this somewhat surprised and embarrassed Foma
in whose eyes Yozhov was after all something of a master or superior
to them while they were really only his servants They did not seem to
notice Gordyeeff although when Yozhov introduced Foma to them they
shook hands with him and said that they were glad to see him He
lay down under a hazelbush and watched them all feeling himself a
stranger in this company and noticing that even Yozhov seemed to have
got away from him deliberately and was paying but little attention
to him He perceived something strange about Yozhov the little
feuilletonwriter seemed to imitate the tone and the speech of the
compositors He bustled about with them at the woodpile uncorked
bottles of beer cursed laughed loudly and tried his best to resemble
them He was even dressed more simply than usual

Eh brethren he exclaimed with enthusiasm I feel well with you
Im not a big bird either I am only the son of the courthouse guard
and noncommissioned officer Matvey Yozhov

Why does he say that thought Foma What difference does it make
whose son a man is A man is not respected on account of his father but
for his brains

The sun was setting like a huge bonfire in the sky tinting the clouds
with hues of gold and of blood Dampness and silence were breathed from
the forest while at its outskirts dark human figures bustled about
noisily One of them short and lean in a broadbrimmed straw hat
played the accordion another one with dark moustache and with his cap
on the back of his head sang an accompaniment softly Two others tugged
at a stick testing their strength Several busied themselves with the
basket containing beer and provisions a tall man with a grayish beard
threw branches on the fire which was enveloped in thick whitish
smoke The damp branches falling on the fire crackled and rustled
plaintively and the accordion teasingly played a lively tune while the
falsetto of the singer reinforced and completed its loud tones

Apart from them all on the brink of a small ravine lay three young
fellows and before them stood Yozhov who spoke in a ringing voice

You bear the sacred banner of labour And I like yourselves am a
private soldier in the same army We all serve Her Majesty the Press
And we must live in firm solid friendship

Thats true Nikolay Matveyich some ones thick voice interrupted
him And we want to ask you to use your influence with the publisher
Use your influence with him Illness and drunkenness cannot be treated
as one and the same thing And according to his system it comes out
thus if one of us gets drunk he is fined to the amount of his days
earnings if he takes sick the same is done We ought to be permitted
to present the doctors certificate in case of sickness to make it
certain and he to be just ought to pay the substitute at least half
the wages of the sick man Otherwise it is hard for us What if three
of us should suddenly be taken sick at once

Yes that is certainly reasonable assented Yozhov But my friends
the principle of cooperation

Foma ceased listening to the speech of his friend for his attention was
diverted by the conversation of others Two men were talking one was
a tall consumptive poorly dressed and angrylooking man the other a
fairhaired and fairbearded young man

In my opinion said the tall man sternly and coughing it is
foolish How can men like us marry There will be children Do we have
enough to support them The wife must be clothedand then you cant
tell what sort of a woman you may strike

Shes a fine girl said the fairhaired man softly Well its now
that she is fine A betrothed girl is one thing a wife quite another
But that isnt the main point You can tryperhaps she will really be
good But then youll be short of means You will kill yourself with
work and you will ruin her too Marriage is an impossible thing for
us Do you mean to say that we can support a family on such earnings
Here you see I have only been married four years and my end is near
I have seen no joynothing but worry and care

He began to cough coughed for a long time with a groan and when he
had ceased he said to his comrade in a choking voice

Drop it nothing will come of it

His interlocutor bent his head mournfully while Foma thought

He speaks sensibly Its evident he can reason well

The lack of attention shown to Foma somewhat offended him and aroused in
him at the same time a feeling of respect for these men with dark faces
impregnated with leaddust Almost all of them were engaged in practical
serious conversation and their remarks were studded with certain
peculiar words None of them fawned upon him none bothered him with
love with his back to the fire and he saw before him a row of brightly
illuminated cheerful and simple faces They were all excited from
drinking but were not yet intoxicated they laughed jested tried to
sing drank and ate cucumbers white bread and sausages All this had
for Foma a particularly pleasant flavour he grew bolder seized by
the general good feeling and he longed to say something good to these
people to please them all in some way or other Yozhov sitting by
his side moved about on the ground jostled him with his shoulder and
shaking his head muttered something indistinctly

Brethren shouted the stout fellow Lets strike up the student song
Well one two

 Swift as the waves

Someone roared in his bass voice

 Are the days of our life

Friends said Yozhov rising to his feet a glass in his hand He
staggered and leaned his other hand against Fomas head The started
song was broken off and all turned their heads toward him

Working men Permit me to say a few words words from the heart I am
happy in your company I feel well in your midst That is because you
are men of toil men whose right to happiness is not subject to doubt
although it is not recognised In your ennobling midst Oh honest
people the lonely man who is poisoned by life breathes so easily so
freely

Yozhovs voice quivered and quaked and his head began to shake Foma
felt that something warm trickled down on his hand and he looked up at
the wrinkled face of Yozhov who went on speaking trembling in every
limb

I am not the only one There are many like myself intimidated by fate
broken and suffering We are more unfortunate than you are because
we are weaker both in body and in soul but we are stronger than you
because we are armed with knowledge which we have no opportunity to
apply We are gladly ready to come to you and resign ourselves to you
and help you to live There is nothing else for us to do Without you
we are without ground to stand on without us you are without light
Comrades we were created by Fate itself to complete one another

What does he beg of them thought Foma listening to Yozhovs words
with perplexity And examining the faces of the compositors he saw that
they also looked at the orator inquiringly perplexedly wearily

The future is yours my friends said Yozhov faintly shaking his
head mournfully as though feeling sorry for the future and yielding
to these people against his will the predominance over it The future
belongs to the men of honest toil You have a great task before you You
have to create a new culture everything free vital and bright I who
am one of you in flesh and in spirit who am the son of a soldier I
propose a toast to your future Hurrah

Yozhov emptied his glass and sank heavily to the ground The compositors
unanimously took up his broken exclamation and a powerful thundering
shout rolled through the air causing the leaves on the trees to
tremble

Lets start a song now proposed the stout fellow again

Come on chimed in two or three voices A noisy dispute ensued as to
what to sing Yozhov listened to the noise and turning his head from
one side to another scrutinized them all

Brethren Yozhov suddenly cried again answer me Say a few words in
reply to my address of welcome

Againthough not at onceall became silent some looking at him with
curiosity others concealing a grin still others with an expression of
dissatisfaction plainly written on their faces And he again rose from
the ground and said hotly

Two of us here are cast away by lifeI and that other one We both
desire the same regard for man and the happiness of feeling ourselves
useful unto others Comrades And that big stupid man

Nikolay Matveyich you had better not insult our guest said someone
in a deep displeased voice

Yes thats unnecessary affirmed the stout fellow who had invited
Foma to the fireside Why use offensive language

A third voice rang out loudly and distinctly

We have come together to enjoy ourselvesto take a rest

Fools laughed Yozhov faintly Kindhearted fools Do you pity him
But do you know who he is He is of those people who suck your blood

That will do Nikolay Matveyich they cried to Yozhov And all began
to talk paying no further attention to him Foma felt so sorry for his
friend that he did not even take offence He saw that these people
who defended him from Yozhovs attacks were now purposely ignoring the
feuilletonwriter and he understood that this would pain Yozhov if he
were to notice it And in order to take his friend away from possible
unpleasantness he nudged him in the side and said with a kindhearted
laugh

Well you grumbler shall we have a drink Or is it time to go home

Home Where is the home of the man who has no place among men asked
Yozhov and shouted again Comrades

Unanswered his shout was drowned in the general murmur Then he drooped
his head and said to Foma

Lets go from here

Lets go Though I dont mind sitting a little longer Its
interesting They behave so nobly the devils By God

I cant bear it any longer I feel cold I am suffocating

Well come then

Foma rose to his feet removed his cap and bowing to the compositors
said loudly and cheerfully

Thank you gentlemen for your hospitality Goodbye

They immediately surrounded him and spoke to him persuasively

Stay here Where are you going We might sing all together eh

No I must go it would be disagreeable to my friend to go alone I am
going to escort him I wish you a jolly feast

Eh you ought to wait a little exclaimed the stout fellow and then
whispered

Some one will escort him home

The consumptive also remarked in a low voice

You stay here Well escort him to town and get him into a cab
andthere you are

Foma felt like staying there and at the same time was afraid of
something While Yozhov rose to his feet and clutching at the sleeves
of his overcoat muttered

Come the devil take them

Till we meet again gentlemen Im going said Foma and departed amid
exclamations of polite regret

Ha ha ha Yozhov burst out laughing when he had got about twenty
steps away from the fire They see us off with sorrow but they are
glad that I am going away I hindered them from turning into beasts

Its true you did disturb them said Foma Why do you make such
speeches People have come out to enjoy themselves and you obtrude
yourself upon them That bores them

Keep quiet You dont understand anything cried Yozhov harshly
You think I am drunk Its my body that is intoxicated but my soul is
sober it is always sober it feels everything Oh how much meanness
there is in the world how much stupidity and wretchedness And
menthese stupid miserable men

Yozhov paused and clasping his head with his hands stood for awhile
staggering

Yes drawled out Foma They are very much unlike one another
Now these men how polite they are like gentlemen And they reason
correctly too and all that sort of thing They have common sense Yet
they are only labourers

In the darkness behind them the men struck up a powerful choral song
Inharmonious at first it swelled and grew until it rolled in a huge
powerful wave through the invigorating nocturnal air above the deserted
field

My God said Yozhov sadly and softly heaving a sigh Whereby are
we to live Whereon fasten our soul Who shall quench its thirsts for
friendship brotherhood love for pure and sacred toil

These simple people said Foma slowly and pensively without
listening to his companion s words absorbed as he was in his own
thoughts if one looks into these people theyre not so bad Its even
veryit is interesting Peasants labourers to look at them plainly
they are just like horses They carry burdens they puff and blow

They carry our life on their backs exclaimed Yozhov with irritation
They carry it like horses submissively stupidly And this
submissiveness of theirs is our misfortune our curse

And Foma carried away by his own thought argued

They carry burdens they toil all their life long for mere trifles
And suddenly they say something that wouldnt come into your mind in a
century Evidently they feel Yes it is interesting to be with them

Staggering Yozhov walked in silence for a long time and suddenly he
waved his hand in the air and began to declaim in a dull choking voice
which sounded as though it issued from his stomach

Life has cruelly deceived me I have suffered so much pain

These dear boy are my own verses said he stopping short and
nodding his head mournfully How do they run Ive forgotten There is
something there about dreams about sacred and pure longings which are
smothered within my breast by the vapour of life Oh

The buried dreams within my breast Will never rise again

Brother You are happier than I because you are stupid While I

Dont be rude said Foma irritated You would better listen how they
are singing

I dont want to listen to other peoples songs said Yozhov with
a shake of the head I have my own it is the song of a soul rent in
pieces by life

And he began to wail in a wild voice

The buried dreams within my breast Will never rise again How great
their number is

There was a whole flower garden of bright living dreams and hopes
They perished withered and perished Death is within my heart The
corpses of my dreams are rotting there Oh oh

Yozhov burst into tears sobbing like a woman Foma pitied him and felt
uncomfortable with him He jerked at his shoulder impatiently and said

Stop crying Come how weak you are brother Clasping his head in
his hand Yozhov straightened up his stooping frame made an effort and
started again mournfully and wildly

How great their number is Their sepulchre how narrow I clothed them
all in shrouds of rhyme And many sad and solemn songs Oer them I sang
from time to time

Oh Lord sighed Foma in despair Stop that for Christs sake By
God how sad

In the distance the loud choral song was rolling through the darkness
and the silence Some one was whistling keeping time to the refrain
and this shrill sound which pierced the ear ran ahead of the billow of
powerful voices Foma looked in that direction and saw the tall black
wall of forest the bright fiery spot of the bonfire shining upon it
and the misty figures surrounding the fire The wall of forest was like
a breast and the fire like a bloody wound in it It seemed as though
the breast was trembling as the blood coursed down in burning streams
Embraced in dense gloom from all sides the people seemed on the
background of the forest like little children they too seemed to
burn illuminated by the blaze of the bonfire They waved their hands
and sang their songs loudly powerfully

And Yozhov standing beside Foma spoke excitedly

You hardhearted blockhead Why do you repulse me You ought to
listen to the song of the dying soul and weep over it for why was it
wounded why is it dying Begone from me begone You think I am drunk
I am poisoned begone

Without lifting his eyes off the forest and the fire so beautiful in
the darkness Foma made a few steps aside from Yozhov and said to him in
a low voice

Dont play the fool Why do you abuse me at random

I want to remain alone and finish singing my song

Staggering he too moved aside from Foma and after a few seconds
again exclaimed in a sobbing voice

 My song is done And nevermore
 Shall I disturb their sleep of death
 Oh Lord Oh Lord repose my soul
 For it is hopeless in its wounds
 Oh Lord repose my soul

Foma shuddered at the sounds of their gloomy wailing and he hurried
after Yozhov but before he overtook him the little feuilletonwriter
uttered a hysterical shriek threw himself chest down upon the ground
and burst out sobbing plaintively and softly even as sickly children
cry

Nikolay said Foma lifting him by the shoulders Cease crying
whats the matter Oh Lord Nikolay Enough arent you ashamed

But Yozhov was not ashamed he struggled on the ground like a fish
just taken from the water and when Foma had lifted him to his feet he
pressed close to Fomas breast clasping his sides with his thin arms
and kept on sobbing

Well thats enough said Foma with his teeth tightly clenched
Enough dear

And agitated by the suffering of the man who was wounded by the
narrowness of life filled with wrath on his account he turned his face
toward the gloom where the lights of the town were glimmering and in
an outburst of wrathful grief roared in a deep loud voice

Aaanathema Be cursed Just wait You too shall choke Be cursed



CHAPTER XI

LUBAVKA said Mayakin one day when he came home from the Exchange
prepare yourself for this evening I am going to bring you a
bridegroom Prepare a nice hearty little lunch for us Put out on the
table as much of our old silverware as possible also bring out the
fruitvases so that he is impressed by our table Let him see that each
and everything we have is a rarity

Lubov was sitting by the window darning her fathers socks and her head
was bent low over her work

What is all this for papa she asked dissatisfied and offended

Why for sauce for flavour And then its in due order For a girl is
not a horse you cant dispose of her without the harness

All aflush with offence Lubov tossed her head nervously and flinging
her work aside cast a glance at her father and taking up the socks
again she bent her head still lower over them The old man paced the
room to and fro plucking at his fiery beard with anxiety his eyes
stared somewhere into the distance and it was evident that he was all
absorbed in some great complicated thought The girl understood that he
would not listen to her and would not care to comprehend how degrading
his words were for her Her romantic dreams of a husbandfriend an
educated man who would read with her wise books and help her to find
herself in her confused desires these dreams were stifled by her
fathers inflexible resolution to marry her to Smolin They had been
killed and had become decomposed settling down as a bitter sediment in
her soul She had been accustomed to looking upon herself as better and
higher than the average girl of the merchant class than the empty and
stupid girl who thinks of nothing but dresses and who marries almost
always according to the calculation of her parents and but seldom in
accordance with the free will of her heart And now she herself is about
to marry merely because it was time and also because her father needed
a soninlaw to succeed him in his business And her father evidently
thought that she by herself was hardly capable of attracting the
attention of a man and therefore adorned her with silver Agitated
she worked nervously pricked her fingers broke needles but maintained
silence being aware that whatever she should say would not reach her
fathers heart

And the old man kept on pacing the room to and fro now humming psalms
softly now impressively instructing his daughter how to behave with the
bridegroom And then he also counted something on his fingers frowned
and smiled

Mm So Try me Oh Lord and judge me From the unjust and the false
man deliver me Yes Put on your mothers emeralds Lubov

Enough papa exclaimed the girl sadly Pray leave that alone

Dont you kick Listen to what Im telling you

And he was again absorbed in his calculations snapping his green eyes
and playing with his fingers in front of his face

That makes thirtyfive percent Mm The fellows a rogue Send down thy
light and thy truth

Papa exclaimed Lubov mournfully and with fright

What

Youare you pleased with him

With whom

Smolin

Smolin Yes hes a rogue hes a clever fellow a splendid merchant
Well Im off now So be on your guard arm yourself

When Lubov remained alone she flung her work aside and leaned against
the back of her chair closing her eyes tightly Her hands firmly
clasped together lay on her knees and their fingers twitched Filled
with the bitterness of offended vanity she felt an alarming fear of the
future and prayed in silence

My God Oh Lord If he were only a kind man Make him kind sincere Oh
Lord A strange man comes examines you and takes you unto himself
for years if you please him How disgraceful that is how terrible Oh
Lord my God If I could only run away If I only had someone to advise
me what to do Who is he How can I learn to know him I cannot do
anything And I have thought ah how much I have thought I have read
To what purpose have I read Why should I know that it is possible to
live otherwise so as I cannot live And it may be that were it not for
the books my life would be easier simpler How painful all this is
What a wretched unfortunate being I am Alone If Taras at least were
here

At the recollection of her brother she felt still more grieved still
more sorry for herself She had written to Taras a long exultant
letter in which she had spoken of her love for him of her hope in him
imploring her brother to come as soon as possible to see his father she
had pictured to him plans of arranging to live together assuring Taras
that their father was extremely clever and understood everything she
told about his loneliness had gone into ecstasy over his aptitude for
life and had at the same time complained of his attitude toward her

For two weeks she impatiently expected a reply and when she had
received and read it she burst out sobbing for joy and disenchantment
The answer was dry and short in it Taras said that within a month he
would be on the Volga on business and would not fail to call on his
father if the old man really had no objection to it The letter was
cold like a block of ice with tears in her eyes she perused it over
and over again rumpled it creased it but it did not turn warmer on
this account it only became wet From the sheet of stiff note paper
which was covered with writing in a large firm hand a wrinkled and
suspiciously frowning face thin and angular like that of her father
seemed to look at her

On Yakov Tarasovich the letter of his son made a different impression
On learning the contents of Tarass reply the old man started and
hastily turned to his daughter with animation and with a peculiar smile

Well let me see it Show it to me Hehe Lets read how wise men
write Where are my spectacles Mm Dear sister Yes

The old man became silent he read to himself the message of his son
put it on the table and raising his eyebrows silently paced the room
to and fro with an expression of amazement on his countenance Then
he read the letter once more thoughtfully tapped the table with his
fingers and spoke

That letter isnt badit is sound without any unnecessary words
Well Perhaps the man has really grown hardened in the cold The cold is
severe there Let him come well take a look at him Its interesting
Yes In the psalm of David concerning the mysteries of his son it is
said When Thou hast returned my enemyIve forgotten how it reads
further My enemys weapons have weakened in the end and his memory
hath perished amid noise Well well talk it over with him without
noise

The old man tried to speak calmly and with a contemptuous smile but the
smile did not come his wrinkles quivered irritably and his small eyes
had a particularly clear brilliancy

Write to him again Lubovka Come along write him dont be afraid
to come

Lubov wrote Taras another letter but this time it was shorter and more
reserved and now she awaited a reply from day to day attempting to
picture to herself what sort of man he must be this mysterious brother
of hers Before she used to think of him with sinking heart with that
solemn respect with which believers think of martyrs men of upright
life now she feared him for he had acquired the right to be judge
over men and life at the price of painful sufferings at the cost of his
youth which was ruined in exile On coming he would ask her

You are marrying of your own free will for love are you not

What should she tell him Would he forgive her faintheartedness And
why does she marry Can it really be possible that this is all she can
do in order to change her life

Gloomy thoughts sprang up one after another in the head of the girl and
confused and tortured her impotent as she was to set up against them
some definite allconquering desire Though she was in an anxious and
compressing her lips Smolin rose from his chair made a step toward her
and bowed respectfully She was rather pleased with this low and polite
bow also with the costly frock coat which fitted Smolins supple
figure splendidly He had changed but slightlyhe was the same
redheaded closelycropped freckled youth only his moustache had
become long and his eyes seemed to have grown larger

Now hes changed eh exclaimed Mayakin to his daughter pointing at
the bridegroom And Smolin shook hands with her and smiling said in a
ringing baritone voice

I venture to hope that you have not forgotten your old friend

Its all right You can talk of this later said the old man scanning
his daughter with his eyes

Lubova you can make your arrangements here while we finish our little
conversation Well then African Mitrich explain yourself

You will pardon me Lubov Yakovlevna wont you asked Smolin gently

Pray do not stand upon ceremony said Lubov Hes polite and clever
she remarked to herself and as she walked about in the room from the
table to the sideboard she began to listen attentively to Smolins
words He spoke softly confidently with a simplicity in which was
felt condescendence toward the interlocutor Well then for four years
I have carefully studied the condition of Russian leather in foreign
markets Its a sad and horrid condition About thirty years ago our
leather was considered there as the standard while now the demand for
it is constantly falling off and of course the price goes hand in
hand with it And that is perfectly natural Lacking the capital and
knowledge all these small leather producers are not able to raise their
product to the proper standard and at the same time to reduce the
price Their goods are extremely bad and dear And they are all to
blame for having spoiled Russias reputation as manufacturer of the best
leather In general the petty producer lacking the technical knowledge
and capital is consequently placed in a position where he is unable to
improve his products in proportion to the development of the technical
side Such a producer is a misfortune for the country the parasite of
her commerce

Hm bellowed the old man looking at his guest with one eye and
watching his daughter with the other So that now your intention is to
build such a great factory that all the others will go to the dogs

Oh no exclaimed Smolin warding off the old mans words with an easy
wave of the hand Why wrong others What right have I to do so My aim
is to raise the importance and price of Russian leather abroad and so
equipped with the knowledge as to the manufacture I am building a model
factory and fill the markets with model goods The commercial honour of
the country

Does it require much capital did you say asked Mayakin
thoughtfully

About three hundred thousand

Father wont give me such a dowry thought Lubov

My factory will also turn out leather goods such as trunks footwear
harnesses straps and so forth

And of what per cent are you dreaming

I am not dreaming I am calculating with all the exactness possible
under conditions in Russia said Smolin impressively The
manufacturer should be as strictly practical as the mechanic who is
creating a machine The friction of the tiniest screw must be taken into
consideration if you wish to do a serious thing seriously I can let
you read a little note which I have drawn up based upon my personal
study of cattlebreeding and of the consumption of meat in Russia

Hows that laughed Mayakin Bring me that note its interesting
It seems you did not spend your time for nothing in Western Europe And
now lets eat something after the Russian fashion

How are you passing the time Lubov Yakovlevna asked Smolin arming
himself with knife and fork

She is rather lonesome here with me replied Mayakin for his daughter
My housekeeper all the household is on her shoulders so she has no
time to amuse herself

And no place I must add said Lubov I am not fond of the balls and
entertainments given by the merchants

And the theatre asked Smolin

I seldom go there I have no one to go with

The theatre exclaimed the old man Tell me pray why has it become
the fashion then to represent the merchant as a savage idiot It is very
amusing but it is incomprehensible because it is false Am I a fool
if I am master in the City Council master in commerce and also owner
of that same theatre You look at the merchant on the stage and
you seehe isnt lifelife Of course when they present something
historical such as Life for the Czar with song and dance or
Hamlet The Sorceress or Vasilisa truthful reproduction is not
required because theyre matters of the past and dont concern us
Whether true or not it matters little so long as theyre good but
when you represent modern times then dont lie And show the man as he
really is

Smolin listened to the old mans words with a covetous smile on his
lips and cast at Lubov glances which seemed to invite her to refute her
father Somewhat embarrassed she said

And yet papa the majority of the merchant class is uneducated and
savage

Yes remarked Smolin with regret nodding his head affirmatively
that is the sad truth

Take Foma for instance went on the girl

Oh exclaimed Mayakin Well you are young folks you can have books
in your hands

And do you not take interest in any of the societies Smolin asked
Lubov You have so many different societies here

Yes said Lubov with a sigh but I live rather apart from
everything

Housekeeping interposed the father We have here such a store
of different things everything has to be kept clean in order and
complete as to number

With a selfsatisfied air he nodded first at the table which was set
with brilliant crystal and silverware and then at the sideboard whose
shelves were fairly breaking under the weight of the articles and which
reminded one of the display in a store window Smolin noted all these
and an ironical smile began to play upon his lips Then he glanced at
Lubovs face in his look she caught something friendly sympathetic
to her A faint flush covered her cheeks and she said to herself with
timid joy

Thank God

The light of the heavy bronze lamp now seemed to flash more brilliantly
on the sides of the crystal vases and it became brighter in the room

I like our dear old town said Smolin looking at the girl with a
kindly smile it is so beautiful so vigorous there is cheerfulness
about it that inspires one to work Its very picturesqueness is somewhat
stimulating In it one feels like leading a dashing life One feels like
working much and seriously And then it is an intelligent town Just
see what a practical newspaper is published here By the way we intend
to purchase it

Whom do you mean by You asked Mayakin

I Urvantzov Shchukin

Thats praiseworthy said the old man rapping the table with his
hand Thats very practical It is time to stop their mouths it was
high time long ago Particularly that Yozhov hes like a sharptoothed
saw Just put the thumbscrew on him And do it well

Smolin again cast at Lubov a smiling glance and her heart trembled
with joy once more With flushing face she said to her father inwardly
addressing herself to the bridegroom

As far as I can understand African Dmitreivich he wishes to buy the
newspaper not at all for the sake of stopping its mouth as you say

What then can be done with it asked the old man shrugging his
shoulders Theres nothing in it but empty talk and agitation Of
course if the practical people the merchants themselves take to
writing for it

The publication of a newspaper began Smolin instructively
interrupting the old man looked at merely from the commercial point
of view may be a very profitable enterprise But aside from this a
newspaper has another more important aimthat is to protect the right
of the individual and the interests of industry and commerce

Thats just what I say if the merchant himself will manage the
newspaper then it will be useful

Excuse me papa said Lubov

She began to feel the need of expressing herself before Smolin she
wanted to assure him that she understood the meaning of his words that
she was not an ordinary merchantdaughter interested in dresses and
balls only Smolin pleased her This was the first time she had seen
a merchant who had lived abroad for a long time who reasoned so
impressively who bore himself so properly who was so well dressed
and who spoke to her father the cleverest man in town with the
condescending tone of an adult towards a minor

After the wedding Ill persuade him to take me abroad thought Lubov
suddenly and confused at this thought she forgot what she was about
to say to her father Blushing deeply she was silent for a few seconds
seized with fear lest Smolin might interpret this silence in a way
unflattering to her

On account of your conversation you have forgotten to offer some wine
to our guest she said at last after a few seconds of painful silence

Thats your business You are hostess retorted the old man

Oh dont disturb yourself exclaimed Smolin with animation I
hardly drink at all

Really asked Mayakin

I assure you Sometimes I drink a wine glass or two in case of fatigue
or illness But to drink wine for pleasures sake is incomprehensible to
me There are other pleasures more worthy of a man of culture

You mean ladies I suppose asked the old man with a wink

Smolins cheeks and neck became red with the colour which leaped to his
face With apologetic eyes he glanced at Lubov and said to her father
drily

I mean the theatre books music

Lubov became radiant with joy at his words

The old man looked askance at the worthy young man smiled keenly and
suddenly blurted out

Eh life is going onward Formerly the dog used to relish a crust now
the pug dog finds the cream too thin pardon me for my sour remark but
it is very much to the point It does not exactly refer to yourself but
in general

Lubov turned pale and looked at Smolin with fright He was calm
scrutinising an ancient salt box decorated with enamel he twisted his
moustache and looked as though he had not heard the old mans words But
his eyes grew darker and his lips were compressed very tightly and his
cleanshaven chin obstinately projected forward

And so my future leading manufacturer said Mayakin as though
nothing had happened three hundred thousand roubles and your business
will flash up like a fire

And within a year and a half I shall send out the first lot of goods
which will be eagerly sought for said Smolin simply with unshakable
confidence and he eyed the old man with a cold and firm look

So be it the firm of Smolin and Mayakin and thats all So Only it
seems rather late for me to start a new business doesnt it I presume
the grave has long been prepared for me what do you think of it

Instead of an answer Smolin burst into a rich but indifferent and cold
laughter and then said

Oh dont say that

The old man shuddered at his laughter and started back with fright
with a scarcely perceptible movement of his body After Smolins words
all three maintained silence for about a minute

Yes said Mayakin without lifting his head which was bent low It
is necessary to think of that I must think of it Then raising his
head he closely scrutinised his daughter and the bridegroom and
rising from his chair he said sternly and brusquely I am going away
for awhile to my little cabinet You surely wont feel lonesome without
me

And he went out with bent back and drooping head heavily scraping with
his feet

The young people thus left alone exchanged a few empty phrases and
evidently conscious that these only helped to remove them further from
each other they maintained a painful awkward and expectant silence
Taking an orange Lubov began to peel it with exaggerated attention
while Smolin lowering his eyes examined his moustaches which he
carefully stroked with his left hand toyed with a knife and suddenly
asked the girl in a lowered voice

Pardon me for my indiscretion It is evidently really difficult
for you Lubov Yakovlevna to live with your father Hes a man with
oldfashioned views and pardon me hes rather hardhearted

Lubov shuddered and casting at the redheaded man a grateful look
said

It isnt easy but I have grown accustomed to it He also has his good
qualities

Oh undoubtedly But to you who are so young beautiful and educated
to you with your views You see I have heard something about you

He smiled so kindly and sympathetically and his voice was so soft a
breath of soulcheering warmth filled the room And in the heart of the
girl there blazed up more and more brightly the timid hope of finding
happiness of being freed from the close captivity of solitude



CHAPTER XII

A DENSE grayish fog lay over the river and a steamer now and then
uttering a dull whistle was slowly forging up against the current Damp
and cold clouds of a monotone pallor enveloped the steamer from
all sides and drowned all sounds dissolving them in their troubled
dampness The brazen roaring of the signals came out in a muffled
melancholy drone and was oddly brief as it burst forth from the
whistle The sound seemed to find no place for itself in the air which
was soaked with heavy dampness and fell downward wet and choked And
the splashing of the steamers wheels sounded so fantastically dull that
it seemed as though it were not begotten near by at the sides of the
vessel but somewhere in the depth on the dark bottom of the river
From the steamer one could see neither the water nor the shore nor
the sky a leadengray gloominess enwrapped it on all sides devoid
of shadings painfully monotonous the gloominess was motionless it
oppressed the steamer with immeasurable weight slackened its movements
and seemed as though preparing itself to swallow it even as it was
swallowing the sounds In spite of the dull blows of the paddles upon
the water and the measured shaking of the body of the vessel it seemed
that the steamer was painfully struggling on one spot suffocating in
agony hissing like a fairy tale monster breathing his last howling in
the pangs of death howling with pain and in the fear of death

Lifeless were the steamer lights About the lantern on the mast a yellow
motionless spot had formed devoid of lustre it hung in the fog over
the steamer illuminating nothing save the gray mist The red starboard
light looked like a huge eye crushed out by some ones cruel fist
blinded overflowing with blood Pale rays of light fell from the
steamers windows into the fog and only tinted its cold cheerless
dominion over the vessel which was pressed on all sides by the
motionless mass of stifling dampness

The smoke from the funnel fell downwards and together with fragments
of the fog penetrated into all the cracks of the deck where the
thirdclass passengers were silently muffling themselves in their rags
and forming groups like sheep From near the machinery were wafted
deep strained groans the jingling of bells the dull sounds of orders
and the abrupt words of the machinist

Yesslow Yeshalf speed

On the stern in a corner blocked up by barrels of salted fish a group
of people was assembled illuminated by a small electric lamp Those
were sedate neatly and warmly clad peasants One of them lay on a
bench face down another sat at his feet still another stood leaning
his back against a barrel while two others seated themselves flat
on the deck Their faces pensive and attentive were turned toward a
roundshouldered man in a short cassock turned yellow and a torn fur
cap That man sat on some boxes with his back bent and staring at his
feet spoke in a low confident voice

There will come an end to the long forbearance of the Lord and then
His wrath will burst forth upon men We are like worms before Him and
how are we then to ward off His wrath with what wailing shall we appeal
to His mercy

Oppressed by his gloominess Foma had come down on the deck from his
cabin and for some time had been standing in the shadow of some wares
covered with tarpaulin and listened to the admonitive and gentle voice
of the preacher Pacing the deck he had chanced upon this group and
attracted by the figure of the pilgrim had paused near it There was
something familiar to him in that large strong body in that stern
dark face in those large calm eyes The curly grayish hair falling
from under the skullcap the unkempt bushy beard which fell apart in
thick locks the long hooked nose the sharppointed ears the thick
lipsFoma had seen all these before but could not recall when and
where

Yes we are very much in arrears before the Lord remarked one of the
peasants heaving a deep sigh

We must pray whispered the peasant who lay on the bench in a
scarcely audible voice

Can you scrape your sinful wretchedness off your soul with words of
prayer exclaimed someone loudly almost with despair in his voice

No one of those that formed the group around the pilgrim turned at this
voice only their heads sank lower on their breasts and for a long time
these people sat motionless and speechless

The pilgrim measured his audience with a serious and meditative glance
of his blue eyes and said softly

Ephraim the Syrian said Make thy soul the central point of thy
thoughts and strengthen thyself with thy desire to be free from sin

And again he lowered his head slowly fingering the beads of the rosary

That means we must think said one of the peasants but when has a
man time to think during his life on earth

Confusion is all around us

We must flee to the desert said the peasant who lay on the bench

Not everybody can afford it

The peasants spoke and became silent again A shrill whistle resounded
a little bell began to jingle at the machine Someones loud exclamation
rang out

Eh there To the watermeasuring poles

Oh Lord Oh Queen of Heavena deep sigh was heard

And a dull halfchoked voice shouted

Nine nine

Fragments of the fog burst forth upon the deck and floated over it like
cold gray smoke

Here kind people give ear unto the words of King David said the
pilgrim and shaking his head began to read distinctly Lead me
Oh Lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way
straight before my face For there is no faithfulness in their mouths
their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre
they flatter with their tongue Destroy thou them Oh God let them fall
by their own counsels

Eight seven Like moans these exclamations resounded in the distance

The steamer began to hiss angrily and slackened its speed The noise of
the hissing of the steam deafened the pilgrims words and Foma saw only
the movement of his lips

Get off a loud angry shout was heard Its my place

Yours

Here you have yours

Ill rap you on the jaw then youll find your place What a lord

Get away

An uproar ensued The peasants who were listening to the pilgrim turned
their heads toward the direction where the row was going on and the
pilgrim heaved a sigh and became silent Near the machine a loud and
lively dispute blazed up as though dry branches thrown upon a dying
bonfire had caught the flame

Ill give it to you devils Get away both of you

Take them away to the captain

Ha ha ha Thats a fine settlement for you

That was a good rap he gave him on the neck

The sailors are a clever lot

Eight nine shouted the man with the measuring pole

Yes increase speed came the loud exclamation of the engineer

Swaying because of the motion of the steamer Foma stood leaning against
the tarpaulin and attentively listened to each and every sound about
him And everything was blended into one picture which was familiar
to him Through fog and uncertainty surrounded on all sides by gloom
impenetrable to the eye life of man is moving somewhere slowly and
heavily And men are grieved over their sins they sigh heavily and
then fight for a warm place and asking each other for the sake of
possessing the place they also receive blows from those who strive for
order in life They timidly search for a free road toward the goal

Nine eight

The wailing cry is softly wafted over the vessel And the holy prayer
of the pilgrim is deafened by the tumult of life And there is no relief
from sorrow there is no joy for him who reflects on his fate

Foma felt like speaking to this pilgrim in whose softly uttered words
there rang sincere fear of God and all manner of fear for men before
His countenance The kind admonitive voice of the pilgrim possessed a
peculiar power which compelled Foma to listen to its deep tones

Id like to ask him where he lives thought Foma fixedly scrutinizing
the huge stooping figure And where have I seen him before Or does he
resemble some acquaintance of mine

Suddenly it somehow struck Foma with particular vividness that the
humble preacher before him was no other than the son of old Anany
Shchurov Stunned by this conjecture he walked up to the pilgrim and
seating himself by his side inquired freely

Are you from Irgiz father

The pilgrim raised his head turned his face toward Foma slowly and
heavily scrutinized him and said in a calm and gentle voice

I was on the Irgiz too

Are you a native of that place

Are you now coming from there

No I am coming from Saint Stephen

The conversation broke off Foma lacked the courage to ask the pilgrim
whether he was not Shchurov

Well be late on account of the fog said some one

How can we help being late

All were silent looking at Foma Young handsome neatly and richly
dressed he aroused the curiosity of the bystanders by his sudden
appearance among them he was conscious of this curiosity he understood
that they were all waiting for his words that they wanted to understand
why he had come to them and all this confused and angered him

It seems to me that Ive met you before somewhere father said he at
length

The pilgrim replied without looking at him

Perhaps

I would like to speak to you announced Foma timidly in a low voice

Well then speak

Come with me

Whither

To my cabin

The pilgrim looked into Fomas face and after a moments silence
assented

Come

On leaving Foma felt the looks of the peasants on his back and now he
was pleased to know that they were interested in him

In the cabin he asked gently

Would you perhaps eat something Tell me I will order it

God forbid What do you wish

This man dirty and ragged in a cassock turned red with age and
covered with patches surveyed the cabin with a squeamish look and when
he seated himself on the plushcovered lounge he turned the skirt of
the cassock as though afraid to soil it by the plush

What is your name father asked Foma noticing the expression of
squeamishness on the pilgrims face

Miron

Not Mikhail

Why Mikhail asked the pilgrim

There was in our town the son of a certain merchant Shchurov he also
went off to the Irgiz And his name was Mikhail

Foma spoke and fixedly looked at Father Miron but the latter was as
calm as a deafmute

I never met such a man I dont remember I never met him said he
thoughtfully So you wished to inquire about him

Yes

No I never met Mikhail Shchurov Well pardon me for Christs sake
and rising from the lounge the pilgrim bowed to Foma and went toward
the door

But wait awhile sit down lets talk a little exclaimed Foma
rushing at him uneasily The pilgrim looked at him searchingly and sank
down on the lounge From the distance came a dull sound like a deep
groan and immediately after it the signal whistle of the steamer
drawled out as in a frightened manner over Fomas and his guests heads
From the distance came a more distant reply and the whistle overhead
again gave out abrupt timorous sounds Foma opened the window Through
the fog not far from their steamer something was moving along with
deep noise specks of fantastic lights floated by the fog was agitated
and again sank into dead immobility

How terrible exclaimed Foma shutting the window

What is there to be afraid of asked the pilgrim You see It is
neither day nor night neither darkness nor light We can see nothing
we are sailing we know not whither we are straying on the river

Have inward fire within you have light within your soul and you shall
see everything said the pilgrim sternly and instructively

Foma was displeased with these cold words and looked at the pilgrim
askance The latter sat with drooping head motionless as though
petrified in thought and prayer The beads of his rosary were softly
rustling in his hands

The pilgrims attitude gave birth to easy courage in Fomas breast and
he said

Tell me Father Miron is it good to live having full freedom without
work without relatives a wanderer like yourself

Father Miron raised his head and softly burst into the caressing
laughter of a child All his face tanned from wind and sunburn
brightened up with inward joy was radiant with tranquil joy he touched
Fomas knee with his hand and said in a sincere tone

Cast aside from you all that is worldly for there is no sweetness
in it I am telling you the right wordturn away from evil Do you
remember it is said

Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
nor standeth in the way of sinners Turn away refresh your soul with
solitude and fill yourself with the thought of God For only by the
thought of Him can man save his soul from profanation

That isnt the thing said Foma I have no need of working out my
salvation Have I sinned so much Look at others What I would like is
to comprehend things

And you will comprehend if you turn away from the world Go forth upon
the free road on the fields on the steppes on the plains on the
mountains Go forth and look at the world from afar from your freedom

Thats right cried Foma Thats just what I think One can see
better from the side

And Miron paying no attention to his words spoke softly as though of
some great mystery known only to him the pilgrim

The thick slumbering forests around you will start to rustle in sweet
voices about the wisdom of the Lord Gods little birds will sing before
you of His holy glory and the grasses of the steppe will burn incense
to the Holy Virgin

The pilgrims voice now rose and quivered from excess of emotion now
sank to a mysterious whisper He seemed as though grown younger his
eyes beamed so confidently and clearly and all his face was radiant
with the happy smile of a man who has found expression for his joy and
was delighted while he poured it forth

The heart of God throbs in each and every blade of grass each and
every insect of the air and of the earth breathes His holy spirit God
the Lord Jesus Christ lives everywhere What beauty there is on earth
in the fields and in the forests Have you ever been on the Kerzhenz
An incomparable silence reigns there supreme the trees the grass there
are like those of paradise

Foma listened and his imagination captivated by the quiet charming
narrative pictured to him those wide fields and dense forests full of
beauty and soulpacifying silence

You look at the sky as you rest somewhere under a little bush and
the sky seems to descend upon you as though longing to embrace you Your
soul is warm filled with tranquil joy you desire nothing you envy
nothing And it actually seems to you that there is no one on earth save
you and God

The pilgrim spoke and his voice and singsong speech reminded Foma of
the wonderful fairytales of Aunt Anfisa He felt as though after a
long journey on a hot day he drank the clear cold water of a forest
brook water that had the fragrance of the grasses and the flowers it
has bathed Even wider and wider grew the pictures as they unfolded
upon him here is a path through the thick slumbering forest the fine
sunbeams penetrate through the branches of the trees and quiver in
the air and under the feet of the wanderer There is a savoury odour of
fungi and decaying foliage the honeyed fragrance of the flowers the
intense odour of the pinetree invisibly rise in the air and penetrate
the breast in a warm rich stream All is silence only the birds are
singing and the silence is so wonderful that it seems as though even
the birds were singing in your breast You go without haste and your
life goes on like a dream While here everything is enveloped in a gray
dead fog and we are foolishly struggling about in it yearning for
freedom and light There below they have started to sing something in
scarcely audible voices it was half song half prayer Again someone is
shouting scolding And still they seek the way

Seven and a half Seven

And you have no care spoke the pilgrim and his voice murmured like
a brook Anybody will give you a crust of bread and what else do
you need in your freedom In the world cares fall upon the soul like
fetters

You speak well said Foma with a sigh

My dear brother exclaimed the pilgrim softly moving still closer
toward him Since the soul has awakened since it yearns toward
freedom do not lull it to sleep by force hearken to its voice The
world with its charms has no beauty and holiness whatever wherefore
then obey its laws In John Chrysostom it is said The real shechinah
is man Shechinah is a Hebrew word and it means the holy of holies
Consequently

A prolonged shrill sound of the whistle drowned his voice He listened
rose quickly from the lounge and said

We are nearing the harbour Thats what the whistle meant I must be
off Well goodbye brother May God give you strength and firmness to
act according to the will of your soul Goodbye my dear boy

He made a low bow to Foma There was something feminine caressing and
soft in his farewell words and bow Foma also bowed low to him bowed
and remained as though petrified standing with drooping head his hand
leaning against the table

Come to see me when you are in town he asked the pilgrim who was
hastily turning the handle of the cabin door

I will I will come Goodbye Christ save you

When the steamers side touched the wharf Foma came out on the deck
and began to look downward into the fog From the steamer people were
walking down the gangplanks but Foma could not discern the pilgrim
among those dark figures enveloped in the dense gloom All those
that left the steamer looked equally indistinct and they all quickly
disappeared from sight as though they had melted in the gray dampness
One could see neither the shore nor anything else solid the landing
bridge rocked from the commotion caused by the steamer above it the
yellow spot of the lantern was swaying the noise of the footsteps and
the bustle of the people were dull

The steamer put off and slowly moved along into the clouds The pilgrim
the harbour the turmoil of peoples voicesall suddenly disappeared
like a dream and again there remained only the dense gloom and the
steamer heavily turning about in it Foma stared before him into the
dead sea of fog and thought of the blue cloudless and caressingly warm
skywhere was it

On the next day about noon he sat In Yozhovs small room and listened
to the local news from the mouth of his friend Yozhov had climbed on
the table which was piled with newspapers and swinging his feet
narrated

The election campaign has begun The merchants are putting your
godfather up as mayorthat old devil Like the devil he is immortal
although he must be upwards of a hundred and fifty years old already
He marries his daughter to Smolin You remember that redheaded fellow
They say that he is a decent man but nowadays they even call clever
scoundrels decent men because there are no men Now Africashka plays
the enlightened man he has already managed to get into intelligent
society donated something to some enterprise or another and thus at
once came to the front Judging from his face he is a sharper of the
highest degree but he will play a prominent part for he knows how
to adapt himself Yes friend Africashka is a liberal And a liberal
merchant is a mixture of a wolf and a pig with a toad and a snake

The devil take them all said Foma waving his hand indifferently
What have I to do with them How about yourselfdo you still keep on
drinking

I do Why shouldnt I drink

Halfclad and dishevelled Yozhov looked like a plucked bird which had
just had a fight and had not yet recovered from the excitement of the
conflict

I drink because from time to time I must quench the fire of my
wounded heart And you you damp stump you are smouldering little by
little

I have to go to the old man said Foma wrinkling his face

Chance it

I dont feel like going Hell start to lecture me

Then dont go

But I must

Then go

Why do you always play the buffoon said Foma with displeasure as
though you were indeed merry

By God I feel merry exclaimed Yozhov jumping down from the table
What a fine roasting I gave a certain gentleman in the paper yesterday
And thenIve heard a clever anecdote A company was sitting on the
seashore philosophizing at length upon life And a Jew said to them
Gentlemen why do you employ so many different words Ill tell it to
you all at once Our life is not worth a single copeck even as this
stormy sea 

Eh the devil take you said Foma Goodbye I am going

Go ahead I am in a fine frame of mind today and I will not moan with
you All the more so considering you dont moan but grunt

Foma went away leaving Yozhov singing at the top of his voice

Beat the drum and fear not

Drum You are a drum yourself thought Foma with irritation as he
slowly came out on the street

At the Mayakins he was met by Luba Agitated and animated she suddenly
appeared before him speaking quickly

You My God How pale you are How thin youve grown It seems you have
been leading a fine life

Then her face became distorted with alarm and she exclaimed almost in a
whisper

Ah Foma You dont know Do you hear Someone is ringing the bell
Perhaps it is he

And she rushed out of the room leaving behind her in the air the rustle
of her silk gown and the astonished Foma who had not even had a chance
to ask her where her father was Yakov Tarasovich was at home Attired
in his holiday clothes in a long frock coat with medals on his breast
he stood on the threshold with his hands outstretched clutching at the
door posts His green little eyes examined Foma and feeling their look
upon him Foma raised his head and met them

How do you do my fine gentleman said the old man shaking his head
reproachfully Where has it pleased you to come from may I ask Who
has sucked off that fat of yours Or is it true that a pig looks for a
puddle and Foma for a place which is worse

Have you no other words for me asked Foma sternly looking straight
into the old mans face And suddenly he noticed that his godfather
shuddered his legs trembled his eyes began to blink repeatedly and
his hands clutched the door posts with an effort Foma advanced toward
him presuming that the old man was feeling ill but Yakov Tarasovich
said in a dull and angry voice

Stand aside Get out of the way

And his face assumed its usual expression

Foma stepped back and found himself side by side with a rather short
stout man who bowed to Mayakin and said in a hoarse voice

How do you do papa

How are you Taras Yakovlich how are you said the old man bowing
smiling distractedly and still clinging to the door posts

Foma stepped aside in confusion seated himself in an armchair and
petrified with curiosity wideeyed began to watch the meeting of
father and son

The father standing in the doorway swayed his feeble body leaning his
hands against the door posts and with his head bent on one side and
eyes half shut stared at his son in silence The son stood about three
steps away from him his head already gray was lifted high he knitted
his brow and gazed at his father with large dark eyes His small black
pointed beard and his small moustache quivered on his meagre face with
its gristly nose like that of his father And the hat also quivered
in his hand From behind his shoulder Foma saw the pale frightened and
joyous face of Lubashe looked at her father with beseeching eyes and
it seemed she was on the point of crying out For a few moments all were
silent and motionless crushed as they were by the immensity of their
emotions The silence was broken by the low but dull and quivering
voice of Yakov Tarasovich

You have grown old Taras

The son laughed in his fathers face silently and with a swift glance
surveyed him from head to foot

The father tearing his hands from the door posts made a step toward his
son and suddenly stopped short with a frown Then Taras Mayakin with
one huge step came up to his father and gave him his hand

Well let us kiss each other suggested the father softly

The two old men convulsively clasped each other in their arms exchanged
warm kisses and then stepped apart The wrinkles of the older man
quivered the lean face of the younger was immobile almost stern The
kisses had changed nothing in the external side of this scene only
Lubov burst into a sob of joy and Foma awkwardly moved about in his
seat feeling as though his breath were failing him

Eh children you are wounds to the heartyou are not its joy
complained Yakov Tarasovich in a ringing voice and he evidently
invested a great deal in these words for immediately after he had
pronounced them he became radiant more courageous and he said briskly
addressing himself to his daughter

Well have you melted with joy You had better go and prepare something
for ustea and so forth Well entertain the prodigal son You must
have forgotten my little old man what sort of a man your father is

Taras Mayakin scrutinized his parent with a meditative look of his large
eyes and he smiled speechless clad in black wherefore the gray hair
on his head and in his beard told more strikingly

Well be seated Tell mehow have you lived what have you done What
are you looking at Ah Thats my godson Ignat Gordyeeffs son Foma
Do you remember Ignat

I remember everything said Taras

Oh Thats good if you are not bragging Well are you married

I am a widower

Have you any children

They died I had two

Thats a pity I would have had grandchildren

May I smoke asked Taras

Go ahead Just look at him youre smoking cigars

Dont you like them

I Come on its all the same to me I say that it looks rather
aristocratic to smoke cigars

And why should we consider ourselves lower than the aristocrats said
Taras laughing

Do I consider ourselves lower exclaimed the old man I merely said
it because it looked ridiculous to me such a sedate old fellow with
beard trimmed in foreign fashion cigar in his mouth Who is he My
sonhehehe the old man tapped Taras on the shoulder and sprang away
from him as though frightened lest he were rejoicing too soon lest
that might not be the proper way to treat that half gray man And he
looked searchingly and suspiciously into his sons large eyes which
were surrounded by yellowish swellings

Taras smiled in his fathers face an affable and warm smile and said to
him thoughtfully

Thats the way I remember youcheerful and lively It looks as though
you had not changed a bit during all these years

The old man straightened himself proudly and striking his breast with
his fist said

I shall never change because life has no power over him who knows his
own value Isnt that so

Oh How proud you are

I must have taken after my son said the old man with a cunning
grimace Do you know dear my son was silent for seventeen years out
of pride

Thats because his father would not listen to him Taras reminded him

Its all right now Never mind the past Only God knows which of us is
to blame He the upright one Hell tell it to youwait I shall keep
silence This is not the time for us to discuss that matter You better
tell mewhat have you been doing all these years How did you come to
that soda factory How have you made your way

Thats a long story said Taras with a sigh and emitting from his
mouth a great puff of smoke he began slowly When I acquired
the possibility to live at liberty I entered the office of the
superintendent of the gold mines of the Remezovs

I know theyre very rich Three brothers I know them all One is a
cripple the other a fool and the third a miser Go on

I served under him for two years And then I married his daughter
narrated Mayakin in a hoarse voice

The superintendents That wasnt foolish at all Taras became
thoughtful and was silent awhile The old man looked at his sad face and
understood his son

And so you lived with your wife happily he said Well what can you
do To the dead belongs paradise and the living must live on You are
not so very old as yet Have you been a widower long

This is the third year

So And how did you chance upon the soda factory

That belongs to my fatherinlaw

Aha What is your salary

About five thousand

Mm Thats not a stale crust Yes thats a galley slave for you

Taras glanced at his father with a firm look and asked him drily

By the way what makes you think that I was a convict

The old man glanced at his son with astonishment which was quickly
changed into joy

Ah What then You were not The devil take them Thenhow was it
Dont take offence How could I know They said you were in Siberia
Well and there are the galleys

To make an end of this once for all said Taras seriously and
impressively clapping his hand on his knee Ill tell you right now
how it all happened I was banished to Siberia to settle there for
six years and during all the time of my exile I lived in the mining
region of the Lena In Moscow I was imprisoned for about nine months
Thats all

Soo But what does it mean muttered Yakov Tarasovich with confusion
and joy

And here they circulated that absurd rumour

Thats rightit is absurd indeed said the old man distressed

And it did a pretty great deal of harm on a certain occasion

Really Is that possible

Yes I was about to go into business for myself and my credit was
ruined on account of

Pshaw said Yakov Tarasovich as he spat angrily Oh devil Come
come is that possible

Foma sat all this time in his corner listening to the conversation
between the Mayakins and blinking perplexedly he fixedly examined the
newcomer Recalling Lubovs bearing toward her brother and influenced
to a certain degree by her stories about Taras he expected to see
in him something unusual something unlike the ordinary people He had
thought that Taras would speak in some peculiar way would dress in
a manner peculiar to himself and in general he would be unlike other
people While before him sat a sedate stout man faultlessly dressed
with stern eyes very much like his father in face and the only
difference between them was that the son had a cigar in his mouth and
a black beard He spoke briefly in a businesslike way of everyday
thingswhere was then that peculiar something about him Now he began
to tell his father of the profits in the manufacture of soda He had not
been a galley slaveLubov had lied And Foma was very much pleased when
he pictured to himself how he would speak to Lubov about her brother

Now and then she appeared in the doorway during the conversation between
her father and her brother Her face was radiant with happiness and her
eyes beamed with joy as she looked at the black figure of Taras clad in
such a peculiarly thick frock coat with pockets on the sides and with
big buttons She walked on tiptoe and somehow always stretched her neck
toward her brother Foma looked at her questioningly but she did not
notice him constantly running back and forth past the door with plates
and bottles in her hands

It so happened that she glanced into the room just when her brother was
telling her father about the galleys She stopped as though petrified
holding a tray in her outstretched hands and listened to everything her
brother said about the punishment inflicted upon him She listened and
slowly walked away without catching Fomas astonished and sarcastic
glance Absorbed in his reflections on Taras slightly offended by the
lack of attention shown him and by the fact that since the handshake
at the introduction Taras had not given him a single glance Foma ceased
for awhile to follow the conversation of the Mayakins and suddenly he
felt that someone seized him by the shoulder He trembled and sprang
to his feet almost felling his godfather who stood before him with
excited face

Therelook That is a man Thats what a Mayakin is They have seven
times boiled him in lye they have squeezed oil out of him and yet he
lives Understand Without any aidalonehe made his way and found his
place andhe is proud That means Mayakin A Mayakin means a man who
holds his fate in his own hands Do you understand Take a lesson from
him Look at him You cannot find another like him in a hundred youd
have to look for one in a thousand What Just bear this in mind You
cannot forge a Mayakin from man into either devil or angel

Stupefied by this tempestuous shock Foma became confused and did not
know what to say in reply to the old mans noisy song of praise He saw
that Taras calmly smoking his cigar was looking at his father and
that the corners of his lips were quivering with a smile His
face looked condescendingly contented and all his figure somewhat
aristocratic and haughty He seemed to be amused by the old mans joy

And Yakov Tarasovich tapped Foma on the chest with his finger and said

I do not know him my own son He has not opened his soul to me It
may be that such a difference had grown up between us that not only
an eagle but the devil himself cannot cross it Perhaps his blood has
overboiled that there is not even the scent of the fathers blood in
it But he is a Mayakin And I can feel it at once I feel it and say
Today thou forgivest Thy servant Oh Lord

The old man was trembling with the fever of his exultation and fairly
hopped as he stood before Foma

Calm yourself father said Taras slowly rising from his chair and
walking up to his father Why confuse the young man Come let us sit
down

He gave Foma a fleeting smile and taking his father by the arm led
him toward the table

I believe in blood said Yakov Tarasovich in hereditary blood
Therein lies all power My father I remember told me Yashka you
are my genuine blood There The blood of the Mayakins is thickit is
transferred from father to father and no woman can ever weaken it Let
us drink some champagne Shall we Very well then Tell me moretell
me about yourself How is it there in Siberia

And again as though frightened and sobered by some thought the old
man fixed his searching eyes upon the face of his son And a few minutes
later the circumstantial but brief replies of his son again aroused in
him a noisy joy Foma kept on listening and watching as he sat quietly
in his corner

Gold mining of course is a solid business said Taras calmly with
importance but it is a rather risky operation and one requiring a
large capital The earth says not a word about what it contains within
it It is very profitable to deal with foreigners Dealings with
them under any circumstances yield an enormous percentage That is a
perfectly infallible enterprise But a weary one it must be admitted
It does not require much brains there is no room in it for an
extraordinary man a man with great enterprising power cannot develop in
it

Lubov entered and invited them all into the diningroom When the
Mayakins stepped out Foma imperceptibly tugged Lubov by the sleeve and
she remained with him alone inquiring hastily

What is it

Nothing said Foma with a smile I want to ask you whether you are
glad

Of course I am exclaimed Lubov

And what about

That is what do you mean

Just so What about

Youre queer said Lubov looking at him with astonishment Cant you
see

What asked Foma sarcastically

Whats the trouble with you said Lubov looking at him uneasily

Eh you drawled out Foma with contemptuous pity Can your father
can the merchant class beget anything good Can you expect a radish to
bring forth raspberries And you lied to me Taras is this Taras is
that What is in him A merchant like the other merchants and his
paunch is also that of the real merchant Hehe He was satisfied
seeing that the girl confused by his words was biting her lips now
flushing now turning pale

Youyou Foma she began in a choking voice and suddenly stamping
her foot she cried

Dont you dare to speak to me

On reaching the threshold of the room she turned her angry face to him
and ejaculated in a low voice emphatically

Oh you malicious man

Foma burst into laughter He did not feel like going to the table where
three happy people were engaged in a lively conversation He heard their
merry voices their contented laughter the rattle of the dishes and he
understood that with that burden on his heart there was no place for
him beside them Nor was there a place for him anywhere If all people
only hated him even as Lubov hated him now he would feel more at ease
in their midst he thought Then he would know how to behave with them
would find something to say to them While now he could not understand
whether they were pitying him or whether they were laughing at him
because he had lost his way and could not conform himself to anything
As he stood awhile alone in the middle of the room he unconsciously
resolved to leave this house where people were rejoicing and where he
was superfluous On reaching the street he felt himself offended by the
Mayakins After all they were the only people near to him in the world
Before him arose his godfathers face on which the wrinkles quivered
with agitation and illuminated by the merry glitter of his green eyes
seemed to beam with phosphoric light

Even a rotten trunk of a tree stands out in the dark reflected Foma
savagely Then he recalled the calm and serious face of Taras and beside
it the figure of Lubov bowing herself hastily toward him That aroused
in him feelings of envy and sorrow

Who will look at me like that There is not a soul to do it

He came to himself from his broodings on the shore at the
landingplaces aroused by the bustle of toil All sorts of articles
and wares were carried and carted in every direction people moved about
hastily careworn spurring on their horses excitedly shouting at one
another filling the street with unintelligible bustle and deafening
noise of hurried work They busied themselves on a narrow strip of
ground paved with stone built up on one side with tall houses and the
other side cut off by a steep ravine at the river and their seething
bustle made upon Foma an impression as though they had all prepared
themselves to flee from this toil amid filth and narrowness and
tumultprepared themselves to flee and were now hastening to complete
the sooner the unfinished work which would not release them Huge
steamers standing by the shore and emitting columns of smoke from their
funnels were already awaiting them The troubled water of the river
closely obstructed with vessels was softly and plaintively splashing
against the shore as though imploring for a minute of rest and repose

Your Honour a hoarse cry rang out near Fomas ears contribute some
brandy in honour of the building

Foma glanced at the petitioner indifferently he was a huge bearded
fellow barefooted with a torn shirt and a bruised swollen face

Get away muttered Foma and turned away from him

Merchant When you die you cant take your money with you Give me
for one glass of brandy or are you too lazy to put your hand into your
pocket

Foma again looked at the petitioner the latter stood before
him covered more with mud than with clothes and trembling with
intoxication waited obstinately staring at Foma with bloodshot
swollen eyes

Is that the way to ask inquired Foma

How else Would you want me to go down on my knees before you for a
tencopeck piece asked the barefooted man boldly

There and Foma gave him a coin

Thanks Fifteen copecks Thanks And if you give me fifteen more Ill
crawl on all fours right up to that tavern Do you want me to proposed
the barefooted man

Go leave me alone said Foma waving him off with his hand

He who gives not when he may when he fain would shall have nay said
the barefooted man and stepped aside

Foma looked at him as he departed and said to himself

There is a ruined man and yet how bold he is He asks alms as though
demanding a debt Where do such people get so much boldness

And heaving a deep sigh he answered himself

From freedom The man is not fettered What is there that he should
regret What does he fear And what do I fear What is there that I
should regret

These two questions seemed to strike Fomas heart and called forth in
him a dull perplexity He looked at the movement of the working people
and kept on thinking What did he regret What did he fear

Alone with my own strength I shall evidently never come out anywhere
Like a fool I shall keep on tramping about among people mocked and
offended by all If they would only jostle me aside if they would only
hate me thenthenI would go out into the wide world Whether I liked
or not I would have to go

From one of the landing wharves the merry dubinushka Dubinushka
or the Oaken Cudgel is a song popular with the Russian workmen had
already been smiting the air for a long time The carriers were doing a
certain work which required brisk movements and were adapting the song
and the refrain to them

 In the tavern sit great merchants
 Drinking liquors strong

narrated the leader in a bold recitative The company joined in unison

 Oh dubinushka heaveho

And then the bassos smote the air with deep sounds

 It goes it goes

And the tenors repeated

 It goes it goes

Foma listened to the song and directed his footsteps toward it on the
wharf There he noticed that the carriers formed in two rows were
rolling out of the steamers hold huge barrels of salted fish Dirty
clad in red blouses unfastened at the collar with mittens on their
hands with arms bare to the elbow they stood over the hold and
merrily jesting with faces animated by toil they pulled the ropes
all together keeping time to their song And from the hold rang out the
high laughing voice of the invisible leader

 But for our peasant throats
 There is not enough vodka

And the company like one huge pair of lungs heaved forth loudly and in
unison

 Oh dubinushka heaveho

Foma felt pleased and envious as he looked at this work which was as
harmonious as music The slovenly faces of the carriers beamed with
smiles the work was easy it went on smoothly and the leader of the
chorus was in his best vein Foma thought that it would be fine to work
thus in unison with good comrades to the tune of a cheerful song to
get tired from work to drink a glass of vodka and eat fat cabbage soup
prepared by the stout sprightly matron of the company

Quicker boys quicker rang out beside him someones unpleasant
hoarse voice

Foma turned around A stout man with an enormous paunch tapped on the
boards of the landing bridge with his cane as he looked at the carriers
with his small eyes and said

Bawl less and work faster

His face and neck were covered with perspiration he wiped it off every
now and then with his left hand and breathed heavily as though he were
going uphill

Foma cast at the man a hostile look and thought

Others are working and he is sweating And I am still worse than he
Im like a crow on the fence good for nothing

From each and every impression there immediately stood out in his mind
the painful thought of his unfitness for life Everything that attracted
his attention contained something offensive to him and this something
fell like a brick upon his breast At one side of him by the freight
scales stood two sailors and one of them a squarebuilt redfaced
fellow was telling the other

As they rushed on me it began for fair my dear chap There were four
of themI was alone But I didnt give in to them because I saw that
they would beat me to death Even a ram will kick out if you fleece
it alive How I tore myself away from them They all rolled away in
different directions

But you came in for a sound drubbing all the same inquired the other
sailor

Of course I caught it I swallowed about five blows But whats the
difference They didnt kill me Well thank God for it

Certainly

To the stern devils to the stern Im telling you roared the
perspiring man in a ferocious voice at two carriers who were rolling a
barrel of fish along the deck

What are you yelling for Foma turned to him sternly as he had
started at the shout

Is that any of your business asked the perspiring man casting a
glance at Foma

It is my business The people are working and your fat is melting away
So you think you must yell at them said Foma threateningly moving
closer toward him

Youyou had better keep your temper

The perspiring man suddenly rushed away from his place and went into his
office Foma looked after him and also went away from the wharf filled
with a desire to abuse some one to do something just to divert his
thoughts from himself at least for a short while But his thoughts took
a firmer hold on him

That sailor there he tore himself away and hes safe and sound Yes
while I

In the evening he again went up to the Mayakins The old man was not at
home and in the diningroom sat Lubov with her brother drinking tea
On reaching the door Foma heard the hoarse voice of Taras

What makes father bother himself about him

At the sight of Foma he stopped short staring at his face with a
serious searching look An expression of agitation was clearly depicted
on Lubovs face and she said with dissatisfaction and at the same time
apologetically

Ah So its you

Theyve been speaking of me thought Foma as he seated himself at
the table Taras turned his eyes away from him and sank deeper in the
armchair There was an awkward silence lasting for about a minute and
this pleased Foma

Are you going to the banquet

What banquet

Dont you know Kononov is going to consecrate his new steamer A mass
will be held there and then they are going to take a trip up the Volga

I was not invited said Foma

Nobody was invited He simply announced on the Exchange Anybody who
wishes to honour me is welcome

I dont care for it

Yes But there will be a grand drinking bout said Lubov looking at
him askance

I can drink at my own expense if I choose to do so

I know said Lubov nodding her head expressively

Taras toyed with his teaspoon turning it between his fingers and
looking at them askance

And wheres my godfather asked Foma

He went to the bank Theres a meeting of the board of directors today
Election of officers is to take place

Theyll elect him again

Of course

And again the conversation broke off Foma began to watch the brother
and the sister Having dropped the spoon Taras slowly drank his tea in
big sips and silently moving the glass over to his sister smiled to
her She too smiled joyously and happily seized the glass and began
to rinse it assiduously Then her face assumed a strained expression
she seemed to prepare herself for something and asked her brother in a
low voice almost reverently

Shall we return to the beginning of our conversation

If you please assented Taras shortly

You said something but I didnt understand What was it I asked If
all this is as you say Utopia if it is impossible dreams then what
is he to do who is not satisfied with life as it is

The girl leaned her whole body toward her brother and her eyes with
strained expectation stopped on the calm face of her brother He
glanced at her in a weary way moved about in his seat and lowering
his head said calmly and impressively

We must consider from what source springs that dissatisfaction with
life It seems to me that first of all it comes from the inability
to work from the lack of respect for work And secondly from a wrong
conception of ones own powers The misfortune of most of the people
is that they consider themselves capable of doing more than they really
can And yet only little is required of man he must select for himself
an occupation to suit his powers and must master it as well as possible
as attentively as possible You must love what you are doing and then
labour be it ever so rough rises to the height of creativeness A
chair made with love will always be a good beautiful and solid chair
And so it is with everything Read Smiles Havent you read him It is
a very sensible book It is a sound book Read Lubbock In general
remember that the English people constitute the nation most qualified
for labour which fact explains their astonishing success in the domain
of industry and commerce With them labour is almost a cult The height
of culture stands always directly dependent upon the love of labour And
the higher the culture the more satisfied are the requirements of man
the fewer the obstacles on the road toward the further development
of mans requirements Happiness is possibleit is the complete
satisfaction of requirements There it is And as you see mans
happiness is dependent upon his relation toward his work

Taras Mayakin spoke slowly and laboriously as though it were unpleasant
and tedious for him to speak And Lubov with knitted brow leaning
toward him listened to his words with eager attention in her eyes
ready to accept everything and imbibe it into her soul

Well and suppose everything is repulsive to a man asked Foma
suddenly in a deep voice casting a glance at Tarass face

But what in particular is repulsive to the man asked Mayakin
calmly without looking at Foma

Foma bent his head leaned his arms against the table and thus like a
bull went on to explain himself

Nothing pleases himbusiness work all people and deeds Suppose I
see that all is deceit that business is not business but merely a
plug that we prop up with it the emptiness of our souls that some work
while others only give orders and sweat but get more for that Why is
it so Eh

I cannot grasp your idea announced Taras when Foma paused feeling
on himself Lubovs contemptuous and angry look

You do not understand asked Foma looking at Taras with a smile
Well Ill put it in this way

A man is sailing in a boat on the river The boat may be good but under
it there is always a depth all the same The boat is sound but if the
man feels beneath him this dark depth no boat can save him

Taras looked at Foma indifferently and calmly He looked in silence and
softly tapped his fingers on the edge of the table Lubov was uneasily
moving about in her chair The pendulum of the clock told the seconds
with a dull sighing sound And Fomas heart throbbed slowly and
painfully as though conscious that here no one would respond with a
warm word to its painful perplexity

Work is not exactly everything for a man said he more to himself
than to these people who had no faith in the sincerity of his words It
is not true that in work lies justification There are people who do not
work at all during all their lives long and yet they live better
than those that do work How is that And the toilersthey are merely
unfortunatehorses Others ride on them they suffer and thats all
But they have their justification before God They will be asked To
what purpose did you live Then they will say We had no time to think
of that We worked all our lives And Iwhat justification have I And
all those people who give ordershow will they justify themselves To
what purpose have they lived It is my idea that everybody necessarily
ought to know to know firmly what he is living for

He became silent and tossing his head up exclaimed in a heavy voice

Can it be that man is born merely to work acquire money build a
house beget children anddie No life means something A man is born
he lives and dies What for It is necessary by God it is necessary
for all of us to consider what we are living for There is no sense in
our life No sense whatever Then things are not equal that can be seen
at once Some are richthey have money enough for a thousand people
and they live in idleness Others bend their backs over their work all
their lives and yet they have not even a grosh And the difference
in people is very insignificant There are some that have not even any
trousers and yet they reason as though they were attired in silks

Carried away by his thoughts Foma would have continued to give them
utterance but Taras moved his armchair away from the table rose and
said softly with a sigh

No thank you I dont want any more

Foma broke off his speech abruptly shrugged his shoulders and looked at
Lubov with a smile

Where have you picked up such philosophy she asked suspiciously and
drily

That is not philosophy That is simply torture said Foma in an
undertone Open your eyes and look at everything Then you will think
so yourself

By the way Luba turn your attention to the fact began Taras
standing with his back toward the table and scrutinizing the clock
that pessimism is perfectly foreign to the AngloSaxon race That
which they call pessimism in Swift and in Byron is only a burning sharp
protest against the imperfection of life and man But you cannot find
among them the cold well weighed and passive pessimism

Then as though suddenly recalling Foma he turned to him clasping his
hands behind his back and wriggling his thigh said

You raise very important questions and if you are seriously interested
in them you must read books In them will you find many very valuable
opinions as to the meaning of life How about youdo you read books

No replied Foma briefly

Ah

I dont like them

Aha But they might nevertheless be of some help to you said Taras
and a smile passed across his lips

Books Since men cannot help me in my thoughts books can certainly do
nothing for me ejaculated Foma morosely

He began to feel awkward and weary with this indifferent man He felt
like going away but at the same time he wished to tell Lubov something
insulting about her brother and he waited till Taras would leave the
room Lubov washed the dishes her face was concentrated and thoughtful
her hands moved lazily Taras was pacing the room now and then
he stopped short before the sideboard on which was the silverware
whistled tapped his fingers against the windowpanes and examined the
articles with his eyes half shut The pendulum of the clock flashed
beneath the glass door of the case like some broad grinning face and
monotonously told the seconds When Foma noticed that Lubov glanced
at him a few times questioningly with expectant and hostile looks he
understood that he was in her way and that she was impatiently expecting
him to leave

I am going to stay here over night said he with a smile I must
speak with my godfather And then it is rather lonesome in my house
alone

Then go and tell Marfusha to make the bed for you in the corner room
Lubov hastened to advise him

I shall

He arose and went out of the diningroom And he soon heard that Taras
asked his sister about something in a low voice

About me he thought Suddenly this wicked thought flashed through
his mind It were but right to listen and hear what wise people have to
say

He laughed softly and stepping on tiptoe went noiselessly into the
other room also adjoining the diningroom There was no light there
and only a thin band of light from the diningroom passing through the
unclosed door lay on the dark floor Softly with sinking heart and
malicious smile Foma walked up close to the door and stopped

Hes a clumsy fellow said Taras

Then came Lubovs lowered and hasty speech

He was carousing here all the time He carried on dreadfully It all
started somehow of a sudden The first thing he did was to thrash
the soninlaw of the ViceGovernor at the Club Papa had to take the
greatest pains to hush up the scandal and it was a good thing that
the ViceGovernors soninlaw is a man of very bad reputation He is a
cardsharper and in general a shady personality yet it cost father more
than two thousand roubles And while papa was busying himself about that
scandal Foma came near drowning a whole company on the Volga

Haha How monstrous And that same man busies himself with
investigating as to the meaning of life

On another occasion he was carousing on a steamer with a company of
people like himself Suddenly he said to them Pray to God Ill fling
every one of you overboard He is frightfully strong They screamed
while he said I want to serve my country I want to clear the earth of
base people

Really Thats clever

Hes a terrible man How many wild pranks he has perpetrated during
these years How much money he has squandered

And tell me on what conditions does father manage his affairs for
him Do you know

No I dont He has a full power of attorney Why do you ask

Simply so Its a solid business Of course it is conducted in purely
Russian fashion in other words it is conducted abominably But it is a
splendid business nevertheless If it were managed properly it would be
a most profitable gold mine

Foma does absolutely nothing Everything is in fathers hands

Yes Thats fine

Do you know sometimes it occurs to me that his thoughtful frame of
mindthat these words of his are sincere and that he can be very
decent But I cannot reconcile his scandalous life with his words and
arguments I cannot do it under any circumstances

It isnt even worthwhile to bother about it The stripling and lazy
bones seeks to justify his laziness

No You see at times he is like a child He was particularly so
before

Well thats what I have said hes a stripling Is it worth while
talking about an ignoramus and a savage who wishes to remain an
ignoramus and a savage and does not conceal the fact You see he
reasons as the bear in the fable bent the shafts

You are very harsh

Yes I am harsh People require that We Russians are all desperately
loose Happily life is so arranged that whether we will it or not we
gradually brace up Dreams are for the lads and maidens but for serious
people there is serious business

Sometimes I feel very sorry for Foma What will become of him

That does not concern me I believe that nothing in particular will
become of himneither good nor bad The insipid fellow will squander
his money away and will be ruined What else Eh the deuce take him
Such people as he is are rare nowadays Now the merchant knows the power
of education And he that fosterbrother of yours he will go to ruin

Thats true sir said Foma opening the door and appearing on the
threshold

Pale with knitted brow and quivering lips he stared straight into
Tarass face and said in a dull voice True I will go to ruin
andamen The sooner the better

Lubov sprang up from the chair with frightened face and ran up to
Taras who stood calmly in the middle of the room with his hands thrust
in his pockets

Foma Oh Shame You have been eavesdropping Oh Foma said she in
confusion

Keep quiet you lamb said Foma to her

Yes eavesdropping is wrong ejaculated Taras slowly without lifting
from Foma his look of contempt

Let it be wrong said Foma with a wave of the hand Is it my fault
that the truth can be learned by eavesdropping only

Go away Foma please entreated Lubov pressing close to her brother

Perhaps you have something to say to me asked Taras calmly

I exclaimed Foma What can I say I cannot say anything It is you
whoyou I believe know everything

You have nothing then to discuss with me asked Taras again

I am very pleased

He turned sideways to Foma and inquired of Lubov

What do you thinkwill father return soon

Foma looked at him and feeling something akin to respect for the man
deliberately left the house He did not feel like going to his own huge
empty house where each step of his awakened a ringing echo he strolled
along the street which was enveloped in the melancholy gray twilight of
late autumn He thought of Taras Mayakin

How severe he is He takes after his father Only hes not so restless
Hes also a cunning rogue I think while Lubka regarded him almost as a
saint That foolish girl What a sermon he read to me A regular judge
And sheshe was kind toward me But all these thoughts stirred in
him no feelingsneither hatred toward Taras nor sympathy for Lubov
He carried with him something painful and uncomfortable something
incomprehensible to him that kept growing within his breast and it
seemed to him that his heart was swollen and was gnawing as though from
an abscess He hearkened to that unceasing and indomitable pain noticed
that it was growing more and more acute from hour to hour and not
knowing how to allay it waited for the results

Then his godfathers trotter passed him Foma saw in the carriage the
small figure of Yakov Mayakin but even that aroused no feeling in him
A lamplighter ran past Foma overtook him placed his ladder against the
lamp post and went up The ladder suddenly slipped under his weight and
he clasping the lamp post cursed loudly and angrily A girl jostled
Foma in the side with her bundle and said

Excuse me

He glanced at her and said nothing Then a drizzling rain began to fall
from the skytiny scarcely visible drops of moisture overcast the
lights of the lanterns and the shop windows with grayish dust This dust
made him breathe with difficulty

Shall I go to Yozhov and pass the night there I might drink with him
thought Foma and went away to Yozhov not having the slightest desire
either to see the feuilletonwriter or to drink with him

At Yozhovs he found a shaggy fellow sitting on the lounge He had on a
blouse and gray pantaloons His face was swarthy as though smoked his
eyes were large immobile and angry his thick upper lip was covered
with a bristlelike soldier moustache He was sitting on the lounge
with his feet clasped in his huge arms and his chin resting on his
knees Yozhov sat sideways in a chair with his legs thrown across the
arm of the chair Among books and newspapers on the table stood a bottle
of vodka and there was an odour of something salty in the room

Why are you tramping about Yozhov asked Foma and nodding at him
said to the man on the lounge Gordyeeff

The man glanced at the newcomer and said in a harsh shrill voice
Krasnoshchokov

Foma seated himself on a corner of the lounge and said to Yozhov

I have come to stay here over night

Well Go on Vasily

The latter glanced at Foma askance and went on in a creaking voice

In my opinion you are attacking the stupid people in vain Masaniello
was a fool but what had to be performed was done in the best way
possible And that Winkelried was certainly a fool also and yet had he
not thrust the imperial spears into himself the Swiss would have been
thrashed Have there not been many fools like that Yet they are the
heroes And the clever people are the cowards Where they ought to deal
the obstacle a blow with all their might they stop to reflect What
will come of it Perhaps we may perish in vain And they stand there
like postsuntil they breathe their last And the fool is brave He
rushes headforemost against the wallbang If his skull breakswhat of
it Calves heads are not dear And if he makes a crack in the wall
the clever people will pick it open into gates will pass and credit
themselves with the honour No Nikolay Matveyich bravery is a good
thing even though it be without reason

Vasily you are talking nonsense said Yozhov stretching his hand
toward him

Ah of course assented Vasily How am I to sip cabbage soup with a
bast shoe And yet I am not blind I can see There is plenty of brains
but no good comes of it During the time the clever people think and
reflect as to how to act in the wisest way the fools will down them
Thats all

Wait a little said Yozhov

I cant I am on duty today I am rather late as it is Ill drop in
tomorrowmay I

Come Ill give a roasting

Thats exactly your business

Vasily adjusted himself slowly rose from the lounge took Yozhovs
yellow thin little hand in his big swarthy paw and pressed it

Goodbye

Then he nodded toward Foma and went through the door sideways

Have you seen Yozhov asked Foma pointing his hand at the door
behind which the heavy footsteps still resounded

What sort of a man is he

Assistant machinist Vaska Krasnoshchokov Here take an example from
him At the age of fifteen he began to study to read and write and at
twentyeight he has read the devil knows how many good books and has
mastered two languages to perfection Now hes going abroad

What for inquired Foma

To study To see how people live there while you languish herewhat
for

He spoke sensibly of the fools said Foma thoughtfully

I dont know for I am not a fool

That was well said The stupid man ought to act at once Rush forward
and overturn

There hes broken loose exclaimed Yozhov You better tell me
whether it is true that Mayakins son has returned

Yes

Why do you ask

Nothing

I can see by your face that there is something

We know all about his son weve heard about him

But I have seen him

Well What sort of man is he

The devil knows him What have I to do with him

Is he like his father

Hes stouter plumper there is more seriousness about him he is so
cold

Which means that he will be even worse than Yashka Well now my dear
be on your guard or they will suck you dry

Well let them do it

Theyll rob you Youll become a pauper That Taras fleeced his
fatherinlaw in Yekateringburg so cleverly

Let him fleece me too if he likes I shall not say a word to him
except thanks

You are still singing that same old tune

Yes

To be set at liberty

Yes

Drop it What do you want freedom for What will you do with it Dont
you know that you are not fit for anything that you are illiterate
that you certainly cannot even split a log of wood Now if I could only
free myself from the necessity of drinking vodka and eating bread

Yozhov jumped to his feet and stopping in front of Foma began to
speak in a loud voice as though declaiming

I would gather together the remains of my wounded soul and together
with the blood of my heart I would spit them into the face of our
intelligent society the devil take it I would say to them

You insects you are the best sap of my country The fact of your
existence has been repaid by the blood and the tears of scores of
generations of Russian people O you nits How dearly your country
has paid for you What are you doing for its sake in return Have you
transformed the tears of the past into pearls What have you contributed
toward life What have you accomplished You have permitted yourselves
to be conquered What are you doing You permit yourselves to be
mocked

He stamped his feet with rage and setting his teeth together stared at
Foma with burning angry looks and resembled an infuriated wild beast

I would say to them You You reason too much but you are not very
wise and you are utterly powerless and you are all cowards Your
hearts are filled up with morality and noble intentions but they are as
soft and warm as feather beds the spirit of creativeness sleeps within
them a profound and calm sleep and your hearts do not throb they
merely rock slowly like cradles Dipping my finger in the blood of my
heart I would smear upon their brows the brands of my reproaches and
they paupers in spirit miserable in their selfcontentment they would
suffer Oh how they would suffer My scourge is sharp my hand is firm
And I love too deeply to have compassion They would suffer And now
they do not suffer for they speak of their sufferings too much too
often and too loud They lie Genuine suffering is mute and genuine
passion knows no bounds Passions passions When will they spring up in
the hearts of men We are all miserable because of apathy

Short of breath he burst into a fit of coughing he coughed for a long
time hopping about hither and thither waving his hands like a madman
And then he again stopped in front of Foma with pale face and bloodshot
eyes He breathed heavily his lips trembled now and then displaying
his small sharp teeth Dishevelled with his head covered with short
heir he looked like a perch just thrown out of the water This was
not the first time Foma saw him in such a state and as always he was
infected by his agitation He listened to the fiery words of the small
man silently without attempting to understand their meaning having
no desire to know against whom they were directed absorbing their force
only Yozhovs words bubbled on like boiling water and heated his soul

I will say to them to those miserable idlers

Look Life goes onward leaving you behind

Eh Thats fine exclaimed Foma ecstatically and began to move about
on the lounge Youre a hero Nikolay Oh Go ahead Throw it right
into their faces

But Yozhov was not in need of encouragement it seemed even as though he
had not heard at all Fomas exclamations and he went on

I know the limitations of my powers I know theyll shout at me Hold
your peace Theyll tell me Keep silence They will say it wisely
they will say it calmly mocking me they will say it from the height
of their majesty I know I am only a small bird Oh I am not a
nightingale Compared with them I am an ignorant man I am only a
feuilletonwriter a man to amuse the public Let them cry and silence
me let them do it A blow will fall on my cheek but the heart will
nevertheless keep on throbbing And I will say to them

Yes I am an ignorant man And my first advantage over you is that
I do not know a single booktruth dearer to me than a man Man is the
universe and may he live forever who carries the whole world within
him And youI will say for the sake of a word which perhaps does
not always contain a meaning comprehensible to you for the sake of a
word you often inflict sores and wounds on one another for the sake of
a word you spurt one another with bile you assault the soul For this
believe me life will severely call you to account a storm will break
loose and it will whisk and wash you off the earth as wind and rain
whisk and wash the dust off a tree I There is in human language only one
word whose meaning is clear and dear to everybody and when that word is
pronounced it sounds thus Freedom

Crush on roared Foma jumping up from the lounge and grasping Yozhov
by the shoulders With flashing eyes he gazed into Yozhovs face
bending toward him and almost moaned with grief and affliction Oh
Nikolay My dear fellow I am mortally sorry for you I am more sorry
than words can tell

Whats this Whats the matter with you cried Yozhov pushing him
away amazed and shifted from his position by Fomas unexpected outburst
and strange words

Oh brother said Foma lowering his voice which thus sounded deeper
more persuasive Oh living soul why do you sink to ruin

Who I I sink You lie

My dear boy You will not say anything to anybody There is no one to
speak to Who will listen to you Only I

Go to the devil shouted Yozhov angrily jumping away from him as
though he had been scorched

And Foma went toward him and spoke convincingly with intense sorrow

Speak speak to me I shall carry away your words to the proper place
I understand them And ah how I will scorch the people Just wait My
opportunity will come

Go away screamed Yozhov hysterically squeezing his back to the
wall under Fomas pressure Perplexed crushed and infuriated he stood
and waved off Fomas arms outstretched toward him And at this time the
door of the room opened and on the threshold appeared a woman all in
black Her face was angrylooking and excited her cheek was tied up
with a kerchief She tossed her head back stretched out her hand toward
Yozhov and said in a hissing and shrill voice

Nikolay Matveyich Excuse me but this is impossible Such beastlike
howling and roaring Guests everyday The police are coming No I cant
bear it any longer I am nervous Please vacate the lodgings tomorrow
You are not living in a desert there are people about you here And
an educated man at that A writer All people require rest I have a
toothache I request you to move tomorrow Ill paste up a notice Ill
notify the police

She spoke rapidly and the majority of her words were lost in the
hissing and whistling of her voice only those words were distinct
which she shrieked out in a shrill irritated tone The corners of her
kerchief protruded on her head like small horns and shook from the
movement of her jaws At the sight of her agitated and comical figure
Foma gradually retreated toward the lounge while Yozhov stood and
wiping his forehead stared at her fixedly and listened to her words

So know it now she screamed and behind the door she said once more

Tomorrow What an outrage

Devil whispered Yozhov staring dully at the door

Yes what a woman How strict said Foma looking at him in amazement
as he seated himself on the lounge

Yozhov raising his shoulders walked up to the table poured out a half
a teaglass full of vodka emptied it and sat down by the table bowing
his head low There was silence for about a minute Then Foma said
timidly and softly

How it all happened We had no time even to wink an eye and suddenly
such an outcome Ah

You said Yozhov in an undertone tossing up his head and staring at
Foma angrily and wildly Keep quiet You the devil take you Lie down
and sleep You monster Nightmare Oh

And he threatened Foma with his fist Then he filled the glass with more
brandy and emptied it again

A few minutes later Foma lay undressed on the lounge and with
halfshut eyes followed Yozhov who sat by the table in an awkward
pose He stared at the floor and his lips were quietly moving Foma was
astonished he could not make out why Yozhov had become angry at him
It could not be because he had been ordered to move out For it was he
himself who had been shouting

Oh devil whispered Yozhov and gnashed his teeth

Foma quietly lifted his head from the pillow Yozhov deeply and noisily
sighing again stretched out his hand toward the bottle Then Foma said
to him softly

Lets go to some hotel It isnt late yet

Yozhov looked at him and rubbing his head with his hands began to
laugh strangely Then he rose from his chair and said to Foma curtly

Dress yourself

And seeing how clumsily and slowly he turned on the lounge Yozhov
shouted with anger and impatience

Well be quicker You personification of stupidity You symbolical
cartshaft

Dont curse said Foma with a peaceable smile Is it worthwhile to
be angry because a woman has cackled

Yozhov glanced at him spat and burst into harsh laughter



CHAPTER XIII

ARE all here asked Ilya Yefimovich Kononov standing on the bow of
his new steamer and surveying the crowd of guests with beaming eyes

It seems to be all

And raising upward his stout red happylooking face he shouted to
the captain who was already standing on the bridge beside the
speakingtube

Cast off Petrukha

Yes sir

The captain bared his huge bald head made the sign of the cross
glancing up at the sky passed his hand over his wide black beard
cleared his throat and gave the command

Back

The guests watched the movements of the captain silently and
attentively and emulating his example they also began to cross
themselves at which performance their caps and high hats flashed
through the air like a flock of black birds

Give us Thy blessing Oh Lord exclaimed Kononov with emotion

Let go astern Forward ordered the captain The massive Ilya
Murometz heaving a mighty sigh emitted a thick column of white steam
toward the side of the landingbridge and started upstream easily like
a swan

How it started off enthusiastically exclaimed commercial counsellor
Lup Grigoryev Reznikov a tall thin goodlooking man Without a
quiver Like a lady in the dance

Half speed

Its not a ship its a Leviathan remarked with a devout sigh the
pockmarked and stooping Trofim Zubov cathedralwarden and principal
usurer in town

It was a gray day The sky overcast with autumn clouds was reflected
in the water of the river thus giving it a cold leaden colouring
Flashing in the freshness of its paint the steamer sailed along the
monotonous background of the river like a huge bright spot and the
black smoke of its breath hung in the air like a heavy cloud All white
with pink paddleboxes and bright red blades the steamer easily cut
through the cold water with its bow and drove it apart toward the
shores and the round windowpanes on the sides of the steamer and
the cabin glittered brilliantly as though smiling a selfsatisfied
triumphant smile

Gentlemen of this honourable company exclaimed Kononov removing his
hat and making a low bow to the guests As we have now rendered unto
God so to say what is due to God would you permit that the musicians
render now unto the Emperor what is due to the Emperor

And without waiting for an answer from his guests he placed his fist
to his mouth and shouted

Musicians Play Be Glorious

The military orchestra behind the engine thundered out the march

And Makar Bobrov the director and founder of the local commercial bank
began to hum in a pleasant basso beating time with his fingers on his
enormous paunch

Be glorious be glorious our Russian Czartrarata Boom

I invite you to the table gentlemen Please Take potluck he he
I entreat you humbly said Kononov pushing himself through the dense
group of guests

There were about thirty of them all sedate men the cream of the
local merchants The older men among them baldheaded and gray wore
oldfashioned frockcoats caps and tall boots But there were only few
of these high silk hats shoes and stylish coats reigned supreme
They were all crowded on the bow of the steamer and little by little
yielding to Kononovs requests moved towards the stern covered with
sailcloth where stood tables spread with lunch Lup Reznikov walked
arm in arm with Yakov Mayakin and bending over to his ear whispered
something to him while the latter listened and smiled Foma who had
been brought to the festival by his godfather after long admonitions
found no companion for himself among these people who were repulsive to
him and pale and gloomy held himself apart from them During the
past two days he had been drinking heavily with Yozhov and now he had
a terrible headache He felt ill at ease in the sedate and yet jolly
company the humming of the voices the thundering of the music and the
clamour of the steamer all these irritated him

He felt a pressing need to doze off and he could find no rest from the
thought as to why his godfather was so kind to him today and why he
brought him hither into the company of the foremost merchants of the
town Why had he urged so persuasively and even entreated him to attend
Kononovs mass and banquet

Dont be foolish come Foma recalled his godfathers admonitions
Why do you fight shy of people Man gets his character from nature
and in riches you are lower than very few You must keep yourself on an
equal footing with the others Come

But when are you going to speak seriously with me papa Foma had
asked watching the play of his godfathers face and green eyes

You mean about setting you free from the business Ha ha Well talk
it over well talk it over my friend What a queer fellow you are
Well Will you enter a monastery when you have thrown away your wealth
After the example of the saints Eh

Ill see then Foma had answered

So Well and meanwhile before you go to the monastery come along
with me Get ready quickly Rub your phiz with something wet for it is
very much swollen Sprinkle yourself with cologne get it from Lubov to
drive away the smell of the kabak Go ahead

Arriving on the steamer while the mass was in progress Foma took up a
place on the side and watched the merchants during the whole service

They stood in solemn silence their faces had an expression of devout
concentration they prayed with fervour deeply sighing bowing low
devoutly lifting their eyes heavenward And Foma looked now at one now
at another and recalled what he knew about them

There was Lup Reznikov he had begun his career as a brothelkeeper and
had become rich all of a sudden They said he had strangled one of
his guests a rich Siberian Zubovs business in his youth had been to
purchase thread from the peasants He had failed twice Kononov had been
tried twenty years ago for arson and even now he was indicted for the
seduction of a minor Together with him for the second time already
on a similar charge Zakhar Kirillov Robustov had been dragged to court
Robustov was a stout short merchant with a round face and cheerful blue
eyes Among these people there was hardly one about whom Foma did not
know something disgraceful

And he knew that they were all surely envying the successful Kononov
who was constantly increasing the number of his steamers from year to
year Many of those people were at daggers points with one another
none of them would show mercy to the others in the battlefield of
business and all knew wicked and dishonest things about one another
But now when they gathered around Kononov who was triumphant and
happy they blended in one dense dark mass and stood and breathed as
one man concentrated and silent surrounded by something invisible yet
firm by something which repulsed Foma from them and which inspired him
with fear of them

Impostors thought he thus encouraging himself

And they coughed gently sighed crossed themselves bowed and
surrounding the clergy in a thick wall stood immovable and firm like
big black rocks

They are pretending Foma exclaimed to himself Beside him stood the
humpbacked oneeyed Pavlin Gushchinhe who not long before had
turned the children of his halfwitted brother into the street as
beggarshe stood there and whispered penetratingly as he looked at the
gloomy sky with his single eye

Oh Lord Do not convict me in Thy wrath nor chastise me in Thy
indignation

And Foma felt that that man was addressing the Lord with the most
profound and firm faith in His mercy

Oh Lord God of our fathers who hadst commanded Noah Thy servant to
build an ark for the preservation of the world said the priest in his
deep bass voice lifting his eyes and outstretching his hands skyward
protect also this vessel and give unto it a guarding angel of good and
peace Guard those that will sail upon it

The merchants in unison made the sign of the cross with wide swings
of their arms and all their faces bore the expression of one
sentimentfaith in the power of prayer All these pictures took root
in Fomas memory and awakened in him perplexity as to these people who
being able to believe firmly in the mercy of God were nevertheless
so cruel unto man He watched them persistently wishing to detect their
fraud to convince himself of their falsehood

Their grave firmness angered him their unanimous selfconfidence their
triumphant faces their loud voices their laughter They were already
seated by the tables covered with luncheon and were hungrily admiring
the huge sturgeon almost three yards in length nicely sprinkled over
with greens and large crabs Trofim Zubov tying a napkin around his
neck looked at the monster fish with happy sweetly halfshut eyes and
said to his neighbour the flour merchant Yona Yushkov

Yona Nikiforich Look its a regular whale Its big enough to serve
as a casket for your person eh Ha ha You could creep into it as a
foot into a boot eh Ha ha

The smallbodied and plump Yona carefully stretched out his short little
hand toward the silver pail filled with fresh caviar smacked his lips
greedily and squinted at the bottles before him fearing lest he might
overturn them

Opposite Kononov on a trestle stood a halfvedro barrel of old vodka
imported from Poland in a huge silvermounted shell lay oysters and a
certain particoloured cake in the shape of a tower stood out above all
the viands

Gentlemen I entreat you Help yourselves to whatever you please
cried Kononov I have here everything at once to suit the taste of
everyone There is our own Russian stuff and there is foreign all
at once Thats the best way Who wishes anything Does anybody want
snails or these crabs eh Theyre from India I am told

And Zubov said to his neighbour Mayakin

The prayer At the Building of a Vessel is not suitable for steamtugs
and river steamers that is not that it is not suitable it isnt
enough alone A river steamer is a place of permanent residence for the
crew and therefore it ought to be considered as a house Consequently
it is necessary to make the prayer At the Building of a House in
addition to that for the vessel But what will you drink

I am not much of a wine fiend Pour me out some cumin vodka replied
Yakov Tarasovich

Foma seated at the end of the table among some timid and modest men who
were unfamiliar to him now and again felt on himself the sharp glances
of the old man

Hes afraid Ill make a scandal thought Foma Brethren roared the
monstrously stout ship builder Yashchurov in a hoarse voice I cant
do without herring I must necessarily begin with herring thats my
nature

Musicians strike up The Persian March

Hold on Better How Glorious

Strike up How Glorious

The puffing of the engine and the clatter of the steamers wheels
mingling with the sounds of the music produced in the air something
which sounded like the wild song of a snowstorm The whistle of the
flute the shrill singing of the clarionets the heavy roaring of the
basses the ruffling of the little drum and the drones of the blows
on the big one all this fell on the monotonous and dull sounds of the
wheels as they cut the water apart smote the air rebelliously drowned
the noise of the human voices and hovered after the steamer like a
hurricane causing the people to shout at the top of their voices At
times an angry hissing of steam rang out within the engine and there
was something irritable and contemptuous in this sound as it burst
unexpectedly upon the chaos of the drones and roars and shouts

I shall never forget even unto my grave that you refused to discount
the note for me cried some one in a fierce voice

That will do Is this a place for accounts rang out Bobrovs bass

Brethren Let us have some speeches

Musicians bush

Come up to the bank and Ill explain to you why I didnt discount it

A speech Silence

Musicians cease playing

Strike up In the Meadows

Madame Angot

No Yakov Tarasovich we beg of you

Thats called Strassburg pastry

We beg of you We beg of you

Pastry It doesnt look like it but Ill taste it all the same

Tarasovich Start

Brethren It is jolly By God

And in La Belle Helene she used to come out almost naked my dear
suddenly Robustovs shrill and emotional voice broke through the noise

Look out Jacob cheated Esau Aha

I cant My tongue is not a hammer and I am no longer young

Yasha We all implore you

Do us the honour

Well elect you mayor

Tarasovich dont be capricious

Sh Silence Gentlemen Yakov Tarasovich will say a few words

Sh

And just at the moment the noise subsided some ones loud indignant
whisper was heard

How she pinched me the carrion

And Bobrov inquired in his deep basso

Where did she pinch you

All burst into ringing laughter but soon fell silent for Yakov
Tarasovich Mayakin rising to his feet cleared his throat and
stroking his bald crown surveyed the merchants with a serious look
expecting attention

Well brethren open your ears shouted Kononov with satisfaction

Gentlemen of the merchant class began Mayakin with a smile There
is a certain foreign word in the language of intelligent and learned
people and that word is culture So now I am going to talk to you
about that word in all the simplicity of my soul

So thats where he is aiming to some ones satisfied exclamation was
heard

Sh Silence

Dear gentlemen said Mayakin raising his voice in the newspapers
they keep writing about us merchants that we are not acquainted with
this culture that we do not want it and do not understand it And
they call us savage uncultured people What is culture It pains me
old man as I am to hear such words and one day I made it my business
to look up that word to see what it really contains Mayakin became
silent surveyed the audience with his eyes and went on distinctly
with a triumphant smile

It proved upon my researches that this word means worship that
is love great love for business and order in life Thats right I
thought thats right That means that he is a cultured man who loves
business and order who in general loves to arrange life loves to
live knows the value of himself and of life Good Yakov Tarasovich
trembled his wrinkles spread over his face like beams from his smiling
eyes to his lips and his bald head looked like some dark star

The merchants stared silently and attentively at his mouth and all
faces bespoke intense attention The people seemed petrified in the
attitudes in which Mayakins speech had overtaken them

But if that word is to be interpreted precisely thus and not
otherwise if such is the casethen the people who call us uncultured
and savage slander and blaspheme us For they love only the word but
not its meaning while we love the very root of the word we love its
real essence we love activity We have within us the real cult toward
life that is the worship of life we not they They love reasoning
we love action And here gentlemen of the merchant class here is an
example of our culture of our love for action Take the Volga Here she
is our dear own mother With each and every drop of her water she can
corroborate our honour and refute the empty blasphemy spattered on us
Only one hundred years have elapsed my dear sirs since Emperor Peter
the Great launched decked barks on this river and now thousands of
steamships sail up and down the river Who has built them The Russian
peasant an utterly unlettered man All these enormous steamers
bargeswhose are they Ours Who has invented them We Everything
here is ours everything here is the fruit of our minds of our Russian
shrewdness and our great love for action Nobody has assisted us in
anything We ourselves exterminated piracy on the Volga at our own
expense we hired troops we exterminated piracy and sent out on the
Volga thousands of steamers and various vessels over all the thousands
of miles of her course Which is the best town on the Volga The one
that has the most merchants Whose are the best houses in town The
merchants Who takes the most care of the poor The merchant He
collects groshes and copecks and donates hundreds of thousands of
roubles Who has erected the churches We Who contributes the most
money to the government The merchants Gentlemen to us alone is the
work dear for its own sake for the sake of our love for the arrangement
of life and we alone love order and life And he who talks about us
merely talks and thats all Let him talk When the wind blows the
willow rustles when the wind subsides the willow is silent and neither
a cartshaft nor a broom can be made out of the willow it is a useless
tree And from this uselessness comes the noise What have they our
judges accomplished how have they adorned life We do not know it
While our work is clearly evident Gentlemen of the merchant class
Seeing in you the foremost men in life most industrious and loving your
labours seeing in you the men who can accomplish and have accomplished
everything I now heartily with respect and love for you lift my
brimming goblet to the glorious strongsouled industrious Russian
merchant class Long may you live May you succeed for the glory of
Mother Russia Hurrah

The shrill jarring shout of Mayakin called forth a deafening
triumphant roar from the merchants All these big fleshy bodies
aroused by wine and by the old mans words stirred and uttered from
their chests such a unanimous massive shout that everything around them
seemed to tremble and to quake

Yakov you are the trumpet of the Lord cried Zubov holding out his
goblet toward Mayakin

Overturning the chairs jostling the tables thus causing the dishes and
the bottles to rattle and fall the merchants agitated delighted some
with tears in their eyes rushed toward Mayakin with goblets in their
hands

Ah Do you understand what has been said here asked Kononov grasping
Robustov by the shoulder and shaking him Understand it That was a
great speech

Yakov Tarasovich Come let me embrace you

Lets toss Mayakin

Strike up the band

Sound a flourish A march The Persian March

We dont want any music The devil take it

Here is the music Eh Yakov Tarasovich What a mind

I was small among my brethren but I was favoured with understanding

You lie Trofim

Yakov youll die soon Oh what a pity Words cant express how sorry
we are

But what a funeral that is going to be

Gentlemen Let us establish a Mayakin fund I put up a thousand

Silence Hold on

Gentlemen Yakov Tarasovich began to speak again quivering in every
limb And furthermore we are the foremost men in life and the real
masters in our fatherland because we arepeasants

Corrrect

Thats right Dear mother Thats an old man for you

Hold on Let him finish

We are primitive Russian people and everything that comes from us is
truly Russian Consequently it is the most genuine the most useful and
obligatory

As true as two and two make four

Its so simple

He is as wise as a serpent

And as meek as a

As a hawk Ha ha ha

The merchants encircled their orator in a close ring they looked at
him with their oily eyes and were so agitated that they could no longer
listen to his words calmly Around him a tumult of voices smote the air
and mingling with the noise of the engine and the beating of the
wheels upon the water it formed a whirlwind of sounds which drowned
the jarring voice of the old man The excitement of the merchants was
growing more and more intense all faces were radiant with triumph
hands holding out goblets were outstretched toward Mayakin the
merchants clapped him on the shoulder jostled him kissed him gazed
with emotion into his face And some screamed ecstatically

The kamarinsky The national dance

We have accomplished all that cried Yakov Tarasovich pointing at the
river It is all ours We have built up life

Suddenly rang out a loud exclamation which drowned all sounds

Ah So you have done it Ah you

And immediately after this a vulgar oath resounded through the air
pronounced distinctly with great rancour in a dull but powerful voice
Everyone heard it and became silent for a moment searching with their
eyes the man who had abused them At this moment nothing was heard save
the deep sighs of the engines and the clanking of the rudder chains

Whos snarling there asked Kononov with a frown

We cant get along without scandals said Reznikov with a contrite
sigh

Who was swearing here at random

The faces of the merchants mirrored alarm curiosity astonishment
reproach and all the people began to bustle about stupidly Only
Yakov Tarasovich alone was calm and seemed even satisfied with what
had occurred Rising on tiptoe with his neck outstretched he stared
somewhere toward the end of the table and his eyes flashed strangely
as though he saw there something which was pleasing to him

Gordyeeff said Yona Yushkov softly

And all heads were turned toward the direction in which Yakov Tarasovich
was staring

There with his hands resting on the table stood Foma His face
distorted with wrath his teeth firmly set together he silently
surveyed the merchants with his burning wideopen eyes His lower jaw
was trembling his shoulders were quivering and the fingers of his
hands firmly clutching the edge of the table were nervously scratching
the tablecloth At the sight of his wolflike angry face and his
wrathful pose the merchants again became silent for a moment

What are you gaping at asked Foma and again accompanied his question
with a violent oath

Hes drunk said Bobrov with a shake of the head

And why was he invited whispered Reznikov softly

Foma Ignatyevich said Kononov sedately you mustnt create
any scandals If your head is reelinggo my dear boy quietly and
peacefully into the cabin and lie down Lie down and

Silence you roared Foma and turned his eye at him Do not dare to
speak to me I am not drunk I am soberer than any one of you here Do
you understand

But wait awhile my boy Who invited you here asked Kononov
reddening with offence

I brought him rang out Mayakins voice

Ah Well then of course Excuse me Foma Ignatyevich But as you
brought him Yakov you ought to subdue him Otherwise its no good

Foma maintained silence and smiled And the merchants too were silent
as they looked at him

Eh Fomka began Mayakin Again you disgrace my old age

Godfather said Foma showing his teeth I have not done anything as
yet so it is rather early to read me a lecture I am not drunk I have
drunk nothing but I have heard everything Gentlemen merchants Permit
me to make a speech My godfather whom you respect so much has spoken
Now listen to his godson

Whatspeeches said Reznikov Why have any discourses We have come
together to enjoy ourselves

Come you had better drop that Foma Ignatyevich

Better drink something

Lets have a drink Ah Foma youre the son of a fine father

Foma recoiled from the table straightened himself and continuously
smiling listened to the kind admonitory words Among all those sedate
people he was the youngest and the handsomest His wellshaped figure
in a tightfitting frock coat stood out to his advantage among the
mass of stout bodies with prominent paunches His swarthy face with
large eyes was more regularly featured more full of life than the
shrivelled or red faces of those who stood before him with astonishment
and expectancy He threw his chest forward set his teeth together and
flinging the skirts of his frock coat apart thrust his hands into his
pockets

You cant stop up my mouth now with flattery and caresses said he
firmly and threateningly Whether you will listen or not I am going to
speak all the same You cannot drive me away from here

He shook his head and raising his shoulders announced calmly

But if any one of you dare to touch me even with a finger Ill kill
him I swear it by the Lord Ill kill as many as I can

The crowd of people that stood opposite him swayed back even as bushes
rocked by the wind They began to talk in agitated whispers Fomas face
grew darker his eyes became round

Well it has been said here that you have built up life and that you
have done the most genuine and proper things

Foma heaved a deep sigh and with inexpressible aversion scrutinized his
listeners faces which suddenly became strangely puffed up as though
they were swollen The merchants were silent pressing closer and closer
to one another Some one in the back rows muttered

What is he talking about Ah From a paper or by heart

Oh you rascals exclaimed Gordyeeff shaking his head What have you
made It is not life that you have made but a prison It is not
order that you have established you have forged fetters on man It is
suffocating it is narrow there is no room for a living soul to turn
Man is perishing You are murderers Do you understand that you exist
today only through the patience of mankind

What does this mean exclaimed Reznikov clasping his hands in rage
and indignation Ilya Yefimov whats this I cant bear to hear such
words

Gordyeeff cried Bobrov Look out you speak improper words

For such words youll getoi oi oi said Zubov insinuatingly

Silence roared Foma with bloodshot eyes Now theyre grunting

Gentlemen rang out Mayakins calm malicious voice like the screech
of a smoothfile on iron Dont touch him I entreat you earnestly do
not hinder him Let him snarl Let him amuse himself His words cannot
harm you

Well no I humbly thank you cried Yushkov And close at Fomas side
stood Smolin and whispered in his ear

Stop my dear boy Whats the matter with you Are you out of your
wits Theyll do you

Get away said Foma firmly flashing his angry eyes at him You go
to Mayakin and flatter him perhaps something will come your way

Smolin whistled through his teeth and stepped aside And the merchants
began to disperse on the steamer one by one This irritated Foma still
more he wished he could chain them to the spot by his words but he
could not find such powerful words

You have built up life he shouted Who are you Swindlers robbers

A few men turned toward Foma as if he had called them

Kononov are they soon going to try you for that little girl Theyll
convict you to the galleys Goodbye Ilya You are building your
steamers in vain Theyll transport you to Siberia on a government
vessel

Kononov sank into a chair his blood leaped to his face and he shook
his fist in silence Foma said hoarsely

Very well Good I shall not forget it

Foma saw his distorted face with its trembling lips and understood with
what weapons he could deal these men the most forcible blows

Ha ha ha Builders of life Gushchin do you give alms to your little
nephews and nieces Give them at least a copeck a day You have stolen
sixtyseven thousand roubles from them Bobrov why did you lie about
that mistress of yours saying that she had robbed you and then send
her to prison If you had grown tired of her you might have given her
over to your son Anyway he has started an intrigue with that other
mistress of yours Didnt you know it Eh you fat pig ha ha And you
Lup open again a brothel and fleece your guests there as before And
then the devil will fleece you ha ha It is good to be a rascal with a
pious face like yours Whom did you kill then Lup

Foma spoke interrupting his speech with loud malevolent laughter and
saw that his words were producing an impression on these people Before
when he had spoken to all of them they turned away from him stepping
aside forming groups and looking at their accuser from afar with
anger and contempt He saw smiles on their faces he felt in their every
movement something scornful and understood that while his words angered
them they did not sting as deep as he wished them to All this had
chilled his wrath and within him there was already arising the bitter
consciousness of the failure of his attack on them But as soon as he
began to speak of each one separately there was a swift and striking
change in the relation of his hearers toward him

When Kononov sank heavily in the chair as though he were unable to
withstand the weight of Fomas harsh words Foma noticed that bitter and
malicious smiles crossed the faces of some of the merchants He heard
some ones whisper of astonishment and approval

Thats well aimed

This whisper gave strength to Foma and he confidently and passionately
began to hurl reproaches jeers and abuses at those who met his eyes
He growled joyously seeing that his words were taking effect He was
listened to silently attentively several men moved closer toward him

Exclamations of protest were heard but these were brief not loud and
each time Foma shouted some ones name all became silent listening
casting furtive malicious glances in the direction of their accused
comrade

Bobrov laughed perplexedly but his small eyes bored into Foma as
gimlets And Lup Reznikov waving his hands hopped about awkwardly and
short of breath said

Be my witnesses Whats this Noo I will not forgive this Ill go
to court Whats that and suddenly he screamed in a shrill voice
outstretching his hand toward Foma

Bind him

Foma was laughing

You cannot bind the truth you cant do it Even bound truth will not
grow dumb

Goood drawled out Kononov in a dull broken voice

See here gentlemen of the merchant class rang out Mayakins voice
I ask you to admire him thats the kind of a fellow he is

One after another the merchants moved toward Foma and on their faces
he saw wrath curiosity a malicious feeling of satisfaction fear Some
one of those modest people among whom Foma was sitting whispered to
him

Give it to them God bless you Go ahead That will be to your credit

Robustov cried Foma What are you laughing at What makes you glad
You will also go to the galleys

Put him ashore suddenly roared Robustov springing to his feet

And Kononov shouted to the captain

Back To the town To the Governor

And someone insinuatingly in a voice trembling with feeling

Thats a collusive agreement That was done on purpose He was
instigated and made drunk to give him courage

No its a revolt

Bind him Just bind him

Foma grasped a champagne bottle and swung it in the air

Come on now No it seems that you will have to listen to me

With renewed fury frantic with joy at seeing these people shrinking and
quailing under the blows of his words Foma again started to shout names
and vulgar oaths and the exasperated tumult was hushed once more The
men whom Foma did not know gazed at him with eager curiosity with
approval while some looked at him even with joyous surprise One of
them a grayhaired little old man with rosy cheeks and small mouse
eyes suddenly turned toward the merchants who had been abused by Foma
and said in a sweet voice

These are words from the conscience Thats nothing You must endure
it Thats a prophetic accusation We are sinful To tell the truth we
are very

He was hissed and Zubov even jostled him on the shoulder He made a low
bow and disappeared in the crowd

Zubov cried Foma How many people have you fleeced and turned to
beggars Do you ever dream of Ivan Petrov Myakinnikov who strangled
himself because of you Is it true that you steal at every mass ten
roubles out of the church box

Zubov had not expected the attack and he remained as petrified with
his hand uplifted But he immediately began to scream in a shrill voice
as he jumped up quickly

Ah You turn against me also Against me too

And suddenly he puffed up his cheeks and furiously began to shake his
fist at Foma as he screamed in a shrill voice

The fool says in his heart there is no God Ill go to the bishop
Infidel Youll get the galleys

The tumult on the steamer grew and at the sight of these enraged
perplexed and insulted people Foma felt himself a fairytale giant
slaying monsters They bustled about waving their arms talking to one
anothersome red with anger others pale yet all equally powerless to
check the flow of his jeers at them

Send the sailors over here cried Reznikov tugging Kononov by the
shoulder Whats the matter with you Ilya Ah Have you invited us to
be ridiculed

Against one puppy screamed Zubov

A crowd had gathered around Yakov Tarasovitch Mayakin and listened to
his quiet speech with anger and nodded their heads affirmatively

Act Yakov said Robustov loudly We are all witnesses Go ahead

And above the general tumult of voices rang out Fomas loud accusing
voice

It was not life that you have builtyou have made a cesspool You have
bred filth and putrefaction by your deeds Have you a conscience Do
you remember God Moneythats your God And your conscience you have
driven away Whither have you driven it away Bloodsuckers You live
on the strength of others You work with other peoples hands You shall
pay for all this When you perish you will be called to account for
everything For everything even to a teardrop How many people have
wept blood at those great deeds of yours And according to your deserts
even hell is too good a place for you rascals Not in fire but in
boiling mud you shall be scorched Your sufferings shall last for
centuries The devils will hurl you into a boiler and will pour into
itha ha ha theyll pour into itha ha ha Honourable merchant
class Builders of Life Oh you devils

Foma burst into ringing laughter and holding his sides staggered
tossing his head up high

At that moment several men quickly exchanged glances simultaneously
rushed on Foma and downed him with their weight A racket ensued

Now youre caught ejaculated some one in a suffocating voice

Ah Is that the way youre doing it cried Foma hoarsely

For about a half a minute a whole heap of black bodies bustled about on
one spot heavily stamping their feet and dull exclamations were heard

Throw him to the ground

Hold his hand his hand Oh

By the beard

Get napkins bind him with napkins

Youll bite will you

So Well hows it Aha

Dont strike Dont dare to strike

Ready

How strong he is

Lets carry him over there toward the side

Out in the fresh air ha ha

They dragged Foma away to one side and having placed him against the
wall of the captains cabin walked away from him adjusting their
costumes and mopping their sweatcovered brows Fatigued by the
struggle and exhausted by the disgrace of his defeat Foma lay there in
silence tattered soiled with something firmly bound hand and foot
with napkins and towels With round bloodshot eyes he gazed at the
sky they were dull and lustreless as those of an idiot and his chest
heaved unevenly and with difficulty

Now came their turn to mock him Zubov began He walked up to him
kicked him in the side and asked in a soft voice all trembling with the
pleasure of revenge

Well thunderlike prophet how is it Now you can taste the sweetness
of Babylonian captivity he he he

Wait said Foma hoarsely without looking at him Wait until Im
rested You have not tied up my tongue

But saying this Foma understood that he could no longer do anything
nor say anything And that not because they had bound him but because
something had burned out within him and his soul had become dark and
empty

Zubov was soon joined by Reznikov Then one after another the others
began to draw near Bobrov Kononov and several others preceded by Yakov
Mayakin went to the cabin anxiously discussing something in low tones

The steamer was sailing toward the town at full speed The bottles on
the tables trembled and rattled from the vibration of the steamer and
Foma heard this jarring plaintive sound above everything else Near him
stood a throng of people saying malicious offensive things

But Foma saw them as though through a fog and their words did not touch
him to the quick A vast bitter feeling was now springing up within
him from the depth of his soul he followed its growth and though he
did not yet understand it he already experienced something melancholy
and degrading

Just think you charlatan What have you done to yourself said
Reznikov What sort of a life is now possible to you Do you know that
now no one of us would care even as much as to spit on you

What have I done Foma tried to understand The merchants stood around
him in a dense dark mass

Well said Yashchurov now Fomka your work is done

Wait well see bellowed Zubov in a low voice

Let me free said Foma

Well no we thank you humbly

Untie me

Its all right You can lie that way as well

Call up my godfather

But Yakov Tarasovich came up at this moment He came up stopped near
Foma sternly surveyed with his eyes the outstretched figure of his
godson and heaved a deep sigh

Well Foma he began

Order them to unbind me entreated Foma softly in a mournful voice

So you can be turbulent again No no youd better lie this way his
godfather replied

I wont say another word I swear it by God Unbind me I am ashamed
For Christs sake You see I am not drunk Well you neednt untie my
hands

You swear that youll not be troublesome asked Mayakin

Oh Lord I will not I will not moaned Foma

They untied his feet but left his hands bound When he rose he looked
at them all and said softly with a pitiful smile

You won

We always shall replied his godfather smiling sternly

Foma bent with his hands tied behind his back advanced toward the
table silently without lifting his eyes to anyone He seemed shorter
in stature and thinner His dishevelled hair fell on his forehead and
temples the torn and crumpled bosom of his shirt protruding from under
his vest and the collar covered his lips He turned his head to push
the collar down under his chin and was unable to do it Then the
grayheaded little old man walked up to him adjusted what was
necessary looked into his eyes with a smile and said

You must endure it

Now in Mayakins presence those who had mocked Foma were silent
looking at the old man questioningly with curiosity and expectancy
He was calm but his eyes gleamed in a way not at all becoming to the
occasion contentedly and brightly

Give me some vodka begged Foma seating himself at the table and
leaning his chest against its edge His bent figure look piteous and
helpless Around they were talking in whispers passing this way and
that cautiously And everyone looked now at him now at Mayakin who had
seated himself opposite him The old man did not give Foma the vodka at
once First he surveyed him fixedly then he slowly poured out a wine
glassful and finally without saying a word raised it to Fomas lips
Foma drank the vodka and asked

Some more

Thats enough replied Mayakin

And immediately after this there fell a minute of perfect painful
silence People were coming up to the table noiselessly on tiptoe and
when they were near they stretched their necks to see Foma

Well Fomka do you understand now what you have done asked Mayakin
He spoke softly but all heard his question

Foma nodded his head and maintained silence

Theres no forgiveness for you Mayakin went on firmly and raising
his voice Though we are all Christians yet you will receive no
forgiveness at our hands Just know this

Foma lifted his head and said pensively

I have quite forgotten about you godfather You have not heard
anything from me

There you have it exclaimed Mayakin bitterly pointing at his
godson You see

A dull grumble of protest burst forth

Well its all the same resumed Foma with a sigh Its all the same
Nothingno good came out of it anyway

And again he bent over the table

What did you want asked Mayakin sternly

What I wanted Foma raised his head looked at the merchants and
smiled I wanted

Drunkard Nasty scamp

I am not drunk retorted Foma morosely I have drank only two
glasses I was perfectly sober

Consequently said Bobrov you are right Yakov Tarasovich he is
insane

I exclaimed Foma

But they paid no attention to him Reznikov Zubov and Bobrov leaned
over to Mayakin and began to talk in low tones

Guardianship Fomas ears caught this one word I am in my right
mind he said leaning back in his chair and staring at the merchants
with troubled eyes I understand what I wanted I wanted to speak the
truth I wanted to accuse you

He was again seized with emotion and he suddenly jerked his hands in an
effort to free them

Eh Hold on exclaimed Bobrov seizing him by the shoulders Hold
him

Well hold me said Foma with sadness and bitterness Hold mewhat
do you need me for

Sit still cried his godfather sternly

Foma became silent He now understood that what he had done was of no
avail that his words had not staggered the merchants Here they stood
surrounding him in a dense throng and he could not see anything for
them They were calm firm treating him as a drunkard and a turbulent
fellow and were plotting something against him He felt himself
pitiful insignificant crushed by that dark mass of strongsouled
clever and sedate people It seemed to him that a long time had passed
since he had abused them so long a time that he himself seemed as a
stranger incapable of comprehending what he had done to these people
and why he had done it He even experienced in himself a certain feeling
of offence which resembled shame at himself in his own eyes There
was a tickling sensation in his throat and he felt there was something
foreign in his breast as though some dust or ashes were strewn upon his
heart and it throbbed unevenly and with difficulty Wishing to explain
to himself his act he said slowly and thoughtfully without looking at
anyone

I wanted to speak the truth Is this life

Fool said Mayakin contemptuously What truth can you speak What do
you understand

My heart is wounded that I understand What justification have you all
in the eyes of God To what purpose do you live Yes I feelI felt the
truth

He is repenting said Reznikov with a sarcastic smile

Let him replied Bobrov with contempt

Some one added

It is evident from his words that he is out of his wits

To speak the truth thats not given to everyone said Yakov
Tarasovich sternly and instructively lifting his hand upward It is
not the heart that grasps truth it is the mind do you understand that
And as to your feeling thats nonsense A cow also feels when they
twist her tail But you must understand understand everything
Understand also your enemy Guess what he thinks even in his dreams and
then go ahead

According to his wont Mayakin was carried away by the exposition of his
practical philosophy but he realised in time that a conquered man is
not to be taught how to fight and he stopped short Foma cast at him a
dull glance and shook his head strangely

Lamb said Mayakin

Leave me alone entreated Foma plaintively Its all yours Well
what else do you want Well you crushed me bruised me that serves me
right Who am I O Lord

All listened attentively to his words and in that attention there was
something prejudiced something malicious

I have lived said Foma in a heavy voice I have observed I have
thought my heart has become wounded with thoughts And herethe
abscess burst Now I am utterly powerless As though all my blood had
gushed out I have lived until this day and still thought that now I
will speak the truth Well I have spoken it

He talked monotonously colourlessly and his speech resembled that of
one in delirium

I have spoken it and I have only emptied myself thats all Not
a trace have my words left behind them Everything is uninjured And
within me something blazed up it has burned out and theres nothing
more there What have I to hope for now And everything remains as it
was

Yakov Tarasovich burst into bitter laughter

What then did you think to lick away a mountain with your tongue You
armed yourself with malice enough to fight a bedbug and you started out
after a bear is that it Madman If your father were to see you now
Eh

And yet said Foma suddenly loudly with assurance and his eyes
again flared up and yet it is all your fault You have spoiled life
You have made everything narrow We are suffocating because of you And
though my truth against you is weak it is truth nevertheless You are
godless wretches May you all be cursed

He moved about in his chair attempting to free his hands and cried
out flashing his eyes with fury

Unbind my hands

They came closer to him the faces of the merchants became more severe
and Reznikov said to him impressively

Dont make a noise dont be bothersome Well soon be in town Dont
disgrace yourself and dont disgrace us either We are not going to
take you direct from the wharf to the insane asylum

So exclaimed Foma So you are going to put me into an insane
asylum

No one replied He looked at their faces and hung his head

Behave peacefully Well unbind you said someone

Its not necessary said Foma in a low voice Its all the same I
spit on it Nothing will happen

And his speech again assumed the nature of a delirium

I am lost I know it Only not because of your power but rather
because of my weakness Yes You too are only worms in the eyes of
God And wait You shall choke I am lost through blindness I saw much
and I became blind like an owl As a boy I remember I chased an owl
in a ravine it flew about and struck against something The sun blinded
it It was all bruised and it disappeared and my father said to me
then It is the same with man some man bustles about to and fro
bruises himself exhausts himself and then throws himself anywhere
just to rest Hey I unbind my hands

His face turned pale his eyes closed his shoulders quivered Tattered
and crumpled he rocked about in the chair striking his chest against
the edge of the table and began to whisper something

The merchants exchanged significant glances Some nudging one another
in the sides shook their heads at Foma in silence Yakov Mayakins face
was dark and immobile as though hewn out of stone

Shall we perhaps unbind him whispered Bobrov

When we get a little nearer

No its not necessary said Mayakin in an undertoneWell leave him
here Let someone send for a carriage Well take him straight to the
asylum

And where am I to rest Foma muttered again Whither shall I fling
myself And he remained as though petrified in a broken uncomfortable
attitude all distorted with an expression of pain on his face

Mayakin rose from his seat and went to the cabin saying softly

Keep an eye on him he might fling himself overboard

I am sorry for the fellow said Bobrov looking at Yakov Tarasovich as
he departed

No one is to blame for his madness replied Reznikov morosely

And Yakov whispered Zubov nodding his head in the direction of
Mayakin

What about Yakov He loses nothing through it

Yes now hell ha ha

Hell be his guardian ha ha ha

Their quiet laughter and whisper mingled with the groaning of the
engine did not seem to reach Fomas ear Motionlessly he stared into
the distance before him with a dim look and only his lips were slightly
quivering

His son has returned whispered Bobrov

I know his son said Yashchurov I met him in Perm

What sort of a man is he

A businesslike clever fellow

Is that so

He manages a big business in Oosolye

Consequently Yakov does not need this one Yes So thats it

Look hes weeping

Oh

Foma was sitting leaning against the back of the chair and drooping
his head on the shoulder His eyes were shut and from under his eyelids
tears were trickling one after another They coursed down his cheeks
into his moustache Fomas lips quivered convulsively and the tears
fell from his moustache upon his breast He was silent and motionless
only his chest heaved unevenly and with difficulty The merchants
looked at his pale tearstained face grown lean with suffering with
the corners of his lips lowered downward and walked away from him
quietly and mutely

And then Foma remained alone with his hands tied behind his back
sitting at the table which was covered with dirty dishes and different
remains of the feast At times he slowly opened his heavy swollen
eyelids and his eyes through tears looked dimly and mournfully at the
table where everything was dirty upset ruined

                    

Three years have passed

About a year ago Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin died He died in full
consciousness and remained true to himself a few hours before his
death he said to his son daughter and soninlaw

Well children live in richness Yakov has tasted everything so
now it is time for Yakov to go You see I am dying yet I am not
despondent and the Lord will set that down to my credit I have
bothered Him the Most Gracious One with jests only but never
with moans and complaints Oh Lord I am glad that I have lived with
understanding through Thy mercy Farewell my children Live in harmony
and dont philosophize too much Know this not he is holy who hides
himself from sin and lies calm With cowardice you cannot defend
yourself against sin thus also says the parable of the talents But he
who wants to attain his goal in life fears not sin God will pardon
him an error God has appointed man as the builder of life but has not
endowed him with too much wisdom Consequently He will not call in his
outstanding debts severely For He is holy and most merciful

He died after a short but very painful agony

Yozhov was for some reason or other banished from the town soon after
the occurrence on the steamer

A great commercial house sprang up in the town under the firmname of
Taras Mayakin  African Smolin

Nothing had been heard of Foma during these three years It was rumoured
that upon his discharge from the asylum Mayakin had sent him away to
some relatives of his mother in the Ural

Not long ago Foma appeared in the streets of the town He is worn
out shabby and halfwitted Almost always intoxicated he appears now
gloomy with knitted brow and with head bent down on his breast now
smiling the pitiful and melancholy smile of a silly fanatic
Sometimes he is turbulent but that happens rarely He lives with his
fostersister in a little wing in the yard His acquaintances among
the merchants and citizens often ridicule him As Foma walks along the
street suddenly someone shouts to him

Eh you prophet come here

Yet he rarely goes to those who call him he shuns people and does not
care to speak with them But when he does approach them they say to him

Well tell us something about doomsday wont you Ha ha ha
Prophet

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
