ACT I

 It is the night of Christmas Eve the SCENE is a Studio flush
 with the street having a skylight darkened by a fall of snow
 There is no one in the room the walls of which are whitewashed
 above a floor of bare dark boards A fire is cheerfully
 burning On a models platform stands an easel and canvas
 There are busts and pictures a screen a little stool two arm
 chairs and a long oldfashioned settle under the window A
 door in one wall leads to the house a door in the opposite wall
 to the models dressingroom and the street door is in the
 centre of the wall between On a low table a Russian samovar is
 hissing and beside it on a tray stands a teapot with glasses
 lemon sugar and a decanter of rum Through a huge uncurtained
 window close to the street door the snowy lamplit street can be
 seen and beyond it the river and a night of stars

 The sound of a latchkey turned in the lock of the street door
 and ANN WELLWYN enters a girl of seventeen with hair tied in a
 ribbon and covered by a scarf Leaving the door open she turns
 up the electric light and goes to the fire She throws of her
 scarf and long red cloak She is dressed in a high evening
 frock of some soft white material Her movements are quick and
 substantial Her face full of no nonsense is decided and
 sincere with deepset eyes and a capable wellshaped
 forehead Shredding of her gloves she warms her hands

 In the doorway appear the figures of two men The first is
 rather short and slight with a soft short beard bright soft
 eyes and a crumply face Under his squash hat his hair is
 rather plentiful and rather grey He wears an old brown ulster
 and woollen gloves and is puffing at a handmade cigarette He
 is ANNS father WELLWYN the artist His companion is a
 wellwrapped clergyman of medium height and stoutish build with
 a pleasant rosy face rather shining eyes and rather chubby
 cleanshaped lips in appearance indeed a grownup boy He is
 the Vicar of the parishCANON BERTLEY


BERTLEY My dear Wellwyn the whole question of reform is full of
difficulty When you have two men like Professor Calway and Sir
Thomas Hoxton taking diametrically opposite points of view as weve
seen tonight I confess I

WELLWYN Come in Vicar and have some grog

BERTLEY Not tonight thanks Christmas tomorrow Great
temptation though this room Goodnight Wellwyn goodnight Ann

ANN Coming from the fire towards the teatable Goodnight
Canon Bertley

 He goes out and WELLWYN shutting the door after him
 approaches the fire

ANN Sitting on the little stool with her back to the fire and
making tea Daddy

WELLWYN My dear

ANN You say you liked Professor Calways lecture Is it going to
do you any good thats the question

WELLWYN II hope so Ann

ANN I took you on purpose Your charitys getting simply awful
Those two this morning cleared out all my housekeeping money

WELLWYN Um Um I quite understand your feeling

ANN They both had your card so I couldnt refusedidnt know what
youd said to them Why dont you make it a rule never to give your
card to anyone except really decent people andpicture dealers of
course

WELLWYN My dear I haveoften

ANN Then why dont you keep it Its a frightful habit You are
naughty Daddy One of these days youll get yourself into most
fearful complications

WELLWYN My dear when theywhen they look at you

ANN You know the house wants all sorts of things Why do you speak
to them at all

WELLWYN I dontthey speak to me

 He takes of his ulster and hangs it over the back of an
 armchair

ANN They see you coming Anybody can see you coming Daddy
Thats why you ought to be so careful I shall make you wear a hard
hat Those squashy hats of yours are hopelessly inefficient

WELLWYN Gazing at his hat Calway wears one

ANN As if anyone would beg of Professor Calway

WELLWYN Wellperhaps not You know Ann I admire that fellow
Wonderful power ofoftheory How a man can be so absolutely tidy in
his mind Its most exciting

ANN Has any one begged of you today

WELLWYN Doubtfully Nono

ANN After a long severe look Will you have rum in your tea

WELLWYN Crestfallen Yes my deara good deal

ANN Pouring out the rum and handing him the glass Well who
was it

WELLWYN He didnt beg of me Losing himself in recollection
Interesting old creature Annreal type Old cabman

ANN Where

WELLWYN Just on the Embankment

ANN Of course Daddy you know the Embankment ones are always
rotters

WELLWYN Yes my dear but this wasnt

ANN Did you give him your card

WELLWYN IIdont

ANN Did you Daddy

WELLWYN Im rather afraid I may have

ANN May have Its simply immoral

WELLWYN Well the old fellow was so awfully human Ann Besides I
didnt give him any moneyhadnt got any

ANN Look here Daddy Did you ever ask anybody for anything You
know you never did youd starve first So would anybody decent
Then why wont you see that people who beg are rotters

WELLWYN But my dear were not all the same They wouldnt do it
if it wasnt natural to them One likes to be friendly Whats the
use of being alive if one isnt

ANN Daddy youre hopeless

WELLWYN But look here Ann the whole things so jolly
complicated According to Calway were to give the State all we can
spare to make the undeserving deserving Hes a Professor he ought
to know But old Hoxtons always dinning it into me that we ought to
support private organisations for helping the deserving and damn the
undeserving Well thats just the opposite And hes a JP
Tremendous experience And the Vicar seems to be for a little bit of
both Well what the devil My trouble is whichever Im with
he always converts me Ruefully And theres no fun in any of
them

ANN Rising Oh Daddy you are sodont you know that youre
the despair of all social reformers She envelops him Theres a
tear in the left knee of your trousers Youre not to wear them
again

WELLWYN Am I likely to

ANN I shouldnt be a bit surprised if it isnt your only pair
Dyou know what I live in terror of

 WELLWYN gives her a queer and apprehensive look

ANN That youll take them off some day and give them away in the
street Have you got any money She feels in his coat and he his
trousersthey find nothing Do you know that your pockets are one
enormous hole

WELLWYN No

ANN Spiritually

WELLWYN Oh Ah Hm

ANN Severely Now look here Daddy She takes him by his
lapels Dont imagine that it isnt the most disgusting luxury on
your part to go on giving away things as you do You know what you
really are I supposea sickly sentimentalist

WELLWYN Breaking away from her disturbed It isnt sentiment
Its simply that they seem to me sosojolly If Im to give up
feeling sort ofnice in here he touches his chest about peopleit
doesnt matter who they arethen I dont know what Im to do
I shall have to sit with my head in a bag

ANN I think you ought to

WELLWYN I suppose they see I like themthen they tell me things
After that of course you cant help doing what you can

ANN Well if you will love them up

WELLWYN My dear I dont want to It isnt them especiallywhy I
feel it even with old Calway sometimes Its only Providence that he
doesnt want anything of meexcept to make me like himselfconfound
him

ANN Moving towards the door into the houseimpressively What
you dont see is that other people arent a bit like you

WELLWYN Well thank God

ANN Its so oldfashioned too Im going to bedI just leave you
to your conscience

WELLWYN Oh

ANN Opening the doorseverely Goodnightwith a certain
weakening you oldDaddy

 She jumps at him gives him a hug and goes out

 WELLWYN stands perfectly still He first gazes up at the
 skylight then down at the floor Slowly he begins to shake his
 head and mutter as he moves towards the fire

WELLWYN Bad lot Low typeno backbone no stability

 There comes a fluttering knock on the outer door As the sound
 slowly enters his consciousness he begins to wince as though
 he knew but would not admit its significance Then he sits
 down covering his ears The knocking does not cease WELLWYN
 drops first one then both hands rises and begins to sidle
 towards the door The knocking becomes louder

WELLWYN Ah dear Tt Tt Tt

 After a look in the direction of ANNs disappearance he opens
 the street door a very little way By the light of the lamp
 there can be seen a young girl in dark clothes huddled in a
 shawl to which the snow is clinging She has on her arm a
 basket covered with a bit of sacking

WELLWYN I cant you know its impossible

 The girl says nothing but looks at him with dark eyes

WELLWYN Wincing Lets seeI dont know youdo I

 The girl speaking in a soft hoarse voice with a faint accent
 of reproach Mrs Meganyou give me this She holds out a
 dirty visiting card

WELLWYN Recoiling from the card Oh Did I Ah When

MRS MEGAN You ad some vilets off of me larst spring You give
me arf a crown

 A smile tries to visit her face

WELLWYN Looking stealthily round Ah Well come injust for a

 She comes in stolidly a Sphinxlike figure with her pretty
 tragic little face

WELLWYN I dont remember you Looking closer Yes I do Only
you werent the samewere you

MRS MEGAN Dully I seen trouble since

WELLWYN Trouble Have some tea

 He looks anxiously at the door into the house then goes
 quickly to the table and pours out a glass of tea putting rum
 into it

WELLWYN Handing her the tea Keeps the cold out Drink it off

 MRS MEGAN drinks it of chokes a little and almost
 immediately seems to get a size larger WELLWYN watches her
 with his head held on one side and a smile broadening on his
 face

WELLWYN Cure for all evils um

MRS MEGAN It warms you She smiles

WELLWYN Smiling back and catching himself out Well You know
I oughtnt

MRS MEGAN Conscious of the disruption of his personality and
withdrawing into her tragic abyss I wouldnt a come but you told

WELLWYN Gradually losing himself in his own nature Let me

MRS MEGAN We was sold up this morninghes gone off with is

WELLWYN Correcting a spasmodic dive into his pockets But who
buys flowers at this time of night

 MRS MEGAN looks at him and faintly smiles

WELLWYN Rumpling his hair Saints above us Here Come to the
fire

 She follows him to the fire He shuts the street door

WELLWYN Are your feet wet She nods Well sit down here and
take them off Thats right

 She sits on the stool And after a slow look up at him which
 has in it a deeper knowledge than belongs of right to her years
 begins taking off her shoes and stockings WELLWYN goes to the
 door into the house opens it and listens with a sort of
 stealthy casualness He returns whistling but not out loud
 The girl has finished taking off her stockings and turned her
 bare toes to the flames She shuffles them back under her
 skirt

WELLWYN How old are you my child

MRS MEGAN Nineteen come Candlemas

MRS MEGAN With stoical vindictiveness Hes after one I know of

 MRS MEGAN looks up and smiles at him as if she had already
 discovered that he is peculiar

WELLWYN You see the fact is I mustnt give you anythingbecause
well for one thing I havent got it There are other reasons but
thats thereal one But now theres a little room where my
models dress I wonder if you could sleep there Come and see

 The Girl gets up lingeringly loth to leave the warmth She
 takes up her wet stockings

MRS MEGAN Shall I put them on again

WELLWYN No no theres a nice warm pair of slippers Seeing the
steam rising from her Why youre wet all over Here wait a
little

 He crosses to the door into the house and after stealthy
 listening steps through The Girl like a cat steals back to
 the warmth of the fire WELLWYN returns with a candle a
 canarycoloured bath gown and two blankets

WELLWYN Now then He precedes her towards the door of the models
room Hsssh He opens the door and holds up the candle to show
her the room Will it do Theres a couch Youll find some
washing things Make yourself quite at home See

 The Girl perfectly dumb passes through with her basketand
 her shoes and stockings WELLWYN hands her the candle
 blankets and bath gown

WELLWYN Have a good sleep child Forget that youre alive
He closes the door mournfully Done it again He goes to the
table cuts a large slice of cake knocks on the door and hands it
in Chowchow Then as he walks away he sights the opposite
door Welldamn it what could I have done Not a farthing on me
He goes to the street door to shut it but first opens it wide to
confirm himself in his hospitality Night like this

 A sputter of snow is blown in his face A voice says
 Monsieur pardon WELLWYN recoils spasmodically A figure
 moves from the lamppost to the doorway He is seen to be young
 and to have ragged clothes He speaks again You do not
 remember me Monsieur My name is Ferrandit was in Paris in
 the ChampsElyseesby the fountain When you came to
 the door MonsieurI am not made of iron Tenez
 here is your card I have never lost it He holds out to WELLWYN
 an old and dirty wing card As inch by inch he has advanced
 into the doorway the light from within falls on him a tall
 gaunt young pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of
 beard a long ironical nose a little to one side and large
 grey rather prominent eyes There is a certain grace in his
 figure and movements his clothes are nearly dropping off him

WELLWYN Yielding to a pleasant memory Ah yes By the
fountain I was sitting there and you came and ate a roll and
drank the water

FERRAND With faint eagerness My breakfast I was in poverty
veree bad off You gave me ten francs I thought I had a little the
right WELLWYN makes a movement of disconcertion seeing you said
that if I came to England

WELLWYN Um And so youve come

FERRAND It was time that I consolidated my fortunes Monsieur

WELLWYN And youhave

 He stops embarrassed

FERRAND Shrugging his ragged shoulders One is not yet Rothschild

WELLWYN Sympathetically No Yielding to memory We talked
philosophy

FERRAND I have not yet changed my opinion We other vagabonds we
are exploited by the bourgeois This is always my idea Monsieur

WELLWYN Yesnot quite the general view perhaps Well
Heartily Come in Very glad to see you again

FERRAND Brushing his arms over his eyes Pardon Monsieuryour
goodnessI am a little weak He opens his coat and shows a belt
drawn very tight over his ragged shirt I tighten him one hole for
each meal during two days now That gives you courage

WELLWYN With cooing sounds pouring out tea and adding rum Have
some of this Itll buck you up He watches the young man drink

FERRAND Becoming a size larger Sometimes I think that I will
never succeed to dominate my life Monsieurthough I have no vices
except that I guard always the aspiration to achieve success But I
will not roll myself under the machine of existence to gain a nothing
every day I must find with what to fly a little

WELLWYN Delicately Yes yesI remember you found it difficult
to stay long in any particularyes

FERRAND Proudly In one little corner NoMonsieurnever
That is not in my character I must see life

WELLWYN Quite quite Have some cake

 He cuts cake

FERRAND In your country they say you cannot eat the cake and have
it But one must always try Monsieur one must never be content
Refusing the cake Grand merci but for the moment I have no
stomachI have lost my stomach now for two days If I could smoke
Monsieur He makes the gesture of smoking

WELLWYN Rather Handing his tobacco pouch Roll yourself one

FERRAND Rapidly rolling a cigarette If I had not found you
MonsieurI would have been a little hole in the river tonight
I was so discouraged He inhales and puffs a long luxurious whif of
smoke Very bitterly Life He disperses the puff of smoke with
his finger and stares before him And to think that in a few
minutes HE will be born Monsieur He gazes intently at WELLWYN
The world would reproach you for your goodness to me

WELLWYN Looking uneasily at the door into the house You think
so Ah

FERRAND Monsieur if HE himself were on earth now there would be a
little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call
Him sloppee sentimentalist And what is veree funny these gentlemen
they would all be most strong Christians He regards WELLWYN
deeply But that will not trouble you Monsieur I saw well from
the first that you are no Christian You have so kind a face

WELLWYN Oh Indeed

FERRAND You have not enough the Pharisee in your character You do
not judge and you are judged

 He stretches his limbs as if in pain

WELLWYN Are you in pain

FERRAND I ave a little the rheumatism

WELLWYN Wet through of course Glancing towards the house Wait
a bit I wonder if youd like these trousers theyveertheyre
not quite

 He passes through the door into the house FERRAND stands at
 the fire with his limbs spread as it were to embrace it
 smoking with abandonment WELLWYN returns stealthily dressed
 in a Jaeger dressinggown and bearing a pair of drawers his
 trousers a pair of slippers and a sweater

WELLWYN Speaking in a low voice for the door is still open Can
you make these do for the moment

FERRAND Je vous remercie Monsieur Pointing to the screen
May I retire

WELLWYN Yes yes

 FERRAND goes behind the screen WELLWYN closes the door into
 the house then goes to the window to draw the curtains He
 suddenly recoils and stands petrified with doubt

WELLWYN Good Lord

 There is the sound of tapping on glass Against the
 windowpane is pressed the face of a man WELLWYN motions to him
 to go away He does not go but continues tapping WELLWYN
 opens the door There enters a square old man with a red
 pendulous jawed shaking face under a snow besprinkled bowler
 hat He is holding out a visiting card with tremulous hand

WELLWYN Whos that Who are you

TIMSON In a thick hoarse shaking voice Appy to see you sir
we ad a talk this morning TimsonI give you me name You invited

WELLWYN Its a little late really

TIMSON Well ye see I never expected to ave to call on yer I

Christmas things ave took a turn with me today He speaks with
increasing thickness Im reglar disgustednot got the price of a

WELLWYN With a mechanical and distracted dive of his hands into
his pockets The fact is it so happens I havent a copper on me

TIMSON Evidently taking this for professional refusal Wouldnt

Its this ere cold Im frightened of Im afraid Ill go to sleep

WELLWYN Well really I

TIMSON To be froze to deathI meanits awkward

WELLWYN Puzzled and unhappy Wellcome in a moment and lets
think it out Have some tea

 He pours out the remains of the tea and finding there is not
 very much adds rum rather liberally TIMSON who walks a
 little wide at the knees steadying his gait has followed

TIMSON Receiving the drink Yer ealth Eressoberiety
He applies the drink to his lips with shaking hand Agreeably
surprised Blimey Thish yer teas foreign aint it

FERRAND Reappearing from behind the screen in his new clothes of
which the trousers stop too soon With a needle Monsieur I would
soon have with what to make face against the world

WELLWYN Too short Ah

 He goes to the dais on which stands ANNs workbasket and takes
 from it a needle and cotton

 While he is so engaged FERRAND is sizing up old TIMSON as one
 dog will another The old man glass in hand seems to have
 lapsed into coma

FERRAND Indicating TIMSON Monsieur

 He makes the gesture of one drinking and shakes his head

WELLWYN Handing him the needle and cotton Um Afraid so

 They approach TIMSON who takes no notice

FERRAND Gently It is an old cabby is it not Monsieur Ceux
sont tous des buveurs

WELLWYN Concerned at the old mans stupefaction Now my old
friend sit down a moment They manoeuvre TIMSON to the settle
Will you smoke

TIMSON In a drowsy voice Thank eesmoke pipe of baccer Old
orsestandin abaht in th cold

 He relapses into coma

FERRAND With a click of his tongue Il est parti

WELLWYN Doubtfully He hasnt really left a horse outside do
you think

FERRAND Non non Monsieurno orse He is dreaming I know very
well that state of himthat catches you sometimes It is the warmth
sudden on the stomach He will speak no more sense tonight At the
most drink and fly a little in his past

WELLWYN Poor old buffer

FERRAND Touching is it not Monsieur There are many brave gents
among the old cabbiesthey have philosophythat comes from orses
and from sitting still

WELLWYN Touching TIMSONs shoulder Drenched

FERRAND That will do im no arm Monsieurno arm at all He is
well wet inside rememberit is Christmas tomorrow Put him a rug
if you will he will soon steam

 WELLWYN takes up ANNs long red cloak and wraps it round the
 old man

TIMSON Faintly roused Thas right Putthe rug on th old
orse

 He makes a strange noise and works his head and tongue

WELLWYN Alarmed Whats the matter with him

FERRAND It is nothing Monsieur for the moment he thinks imself a
orse Il joue cachecache ide and seek with what you call

WELLWYN But whats to be done with him One cant turn him out in

WELLWYN Wellkeep the fire up quietlyvery quietly Youd better

WELLWYN Ah Yes Thanks Wellgoodnight By the way I shall

FERRAND Tres bien Monsieur I comprehend One must well be

WELLWYN With a start Lord He looks at the door of the
models room Id forgotten

FERRAND Can I undertake anything Monsieur

WELLWYN No no He goes to the electric light switch by the outer
door You wont want this will you

FERRAND Merci Monsieur

 WELLWYN switches off the light

FERRAND Bon soir Monsieur

WELLWYN The devil Ergoodnight

 He hesitates rumples his hair and passes rather suddenly
 away

FERRAND To himself Poor pigeon Looking long at old TIMSON
Espece de type anglais

 He sits down in the firelight curls up a foot on his knee and
 taking out a knife rips the stitching of a turnedup end of
 trouser pinches the cloth double and puts in the preliminary
 stitch of a new hemall with the swiftness of one wellaccustomed
 Then as if hearing a sound behind him he gets up quickly and
 slips behind the screen MRS MEGAN attracted by the cessation
 of voices has opened the door and is creeping from the models
 room towards the fire She has almost reached it before she
 takes in the torpid crimson figure of old TIMSON She halts and
 puts her hand to her chesta queer figure in the firelight
 garbed in the canarycoloured bath gown and rabbitswool
 slippers her black matted hair straggling down on her neck
 Having quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of
 stupor MRS MEGAN goes close to the fire and sits on the little
 stool smiling sideways at old TIMSON FERRAND coming quietly
 up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if
 enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back
 a yard or two

FERRAND Gently Pardon Mamoiselle

MRS MEGAN Springing to her feet Oh

FERRAND All right all right We are brave gents

TIMSON Faintly roused Old up there

FERRAND Trust in me Mamoiselle

 MRS MEGAN responds by drawing away

FERRAND Gently We must be good comrades This asylumit is
better than a dossouse

 He pushes the stool over towards her and seats himself
 Somewhat reassured MRS MEGAN again sits down

MRS MEGAN You frightened me

TIMSON Unexpectedlyin a drowsy tone Purple foreigners

FERRAND Pay no attention Mamoiselle He is a philosopher

MRS MEGAN Oh I thought e was boozed

 They both look at TIMSON

FERRAND It is the sameveree armless

MRS MEGAN Whats that hes got on im

FERRAND It is a coronation robe Have no fear Mamoiselle Veree
docile potentate

MRS MEGAN I wouldnt be afraid of him Challenging FERRAND Im
afraid o you

FERRAND It is because you do not know me Mamoiselle You are
wrong it is always the unknown you should love

MRS MEGAN I dont like the way youspeaks to me

FERRAND Ah You are a Princess in disguise

MRS MEGAN No fear

FERRAND No What is it then you do to make face against the
necessities of life A living

MRS MEGAN Sells flowers

FERRAND Rolling his eyes It is not a career

MRS MEGAN With a touch of devilry You dont know what I do

FERRAND Mamoiselle whatever you do is charming

 MRS MEGAN looks at him and slowly smiles

MRS MEGAN Youre a foreigner

FERRAND It is true

MRS MEGAN What do you do for a livin

FERRAND I am an interpreter

MRS MEGAN You aint very busy are you

FERRAND With dignity At present I am resting

MRS MEGAN Looking at him and smiling How did you and im come
here

FERRAND Mamoiselle we would ask you the same question

MRS MEGAN The gentleman let me Es funny

FERRAND Cest un ange At MRS MEGANs blank stare he
interprets An angel

MRS MEGAN Me lucks outthats why I come

FERRAND Rising Ah Mamoiselle Luck There is the little
God who dominates us all Look at this old He points to TIMSON
He is finished In his day that old would be doing good business
He could afford himselfHe maker a sign of drinkingThen come
the motor cars All goeshe has nothing left only is abits of a
cocher Luck

TIMSON With a vague gesturedrowsily Kick the foreign beggars
out

FERRAND A real Englishman And look at me My father
was merchant of ostrich feathers in Brussels If I had been content
to go in his business I would ave been rich But I was born to
rollrolling stone to voyage is stronger than myself Luck
And you Mamoiselle shall I tell your fortune He looks in her
face You were born for la joie de vivreto drink the wines of
life Et vous voila Luck

 Though she does not in the least understand what he has said
 her expression changes to a sort of glee

FERRAND Yes You were born loving pleasure Is it not You see
you cannot say No All of us we have our fates Give me your
hand He kneels down and takes her hand In each of us there is
that against which we cannot struggle Yes yes

 He holds her hand and turns it over between his own
 MRS MEGAN remains stolid half fascinated halfreluctant

TIMSON Flickering into consciousness Beave yourselves Yer
crimson canary birds

 MRS MEGAN would withdraw her hand but cannot

FERRAND Pay no attention Mamoiselle He is a Puritan

 TIMSON relapses into comatosity upsetting his glass which
 falls with a crash

MRS MEGAN Let go my hand please

FERRAND Relinquishing it and staring into the fore gravely
There is one thing I have never doneurt a womanthat is hardly in
my character Then drawing a little closer he looks into her
face Tell me Mamoiselle what is it you think of all day long

MRS MEGAN I dunnolots I thinks of

FERRAND Shall I tell you Her eyes remain fixed on his the
strangeness of him preventing her from telling him to get along
He goes on in his ironic voice It is of the streetsthe lights
the facesit is of all which moves and is warmit is of colourit
is he brings his face quite close to hers of Love That is for you
what the road is for me That is for you what the rum is for that
oldHe jerks his thumb back at TIMSON Then bending swiftly
forward to the girl See I kiss youAh

 He draws her forward off the stool There is a little
 struggle then she resigns her lips The little stool
 overturned falls with a clatter They spring up and move
 apart The door opens and ANN enters from the house in a blue
 dressinggown with her hair loose and a candle held high above
 her head Taking in the strange halfcircle round the stove
 she recoils Then standing her ground calls in a voice
 sharpened by fright DaddyDaddy

TIMSON Stirring uneasily and struggling to his feet All right
Im comin

FERRAND Have no fear Madame

 In the silence that follows a clock begins loudly striking
 twelve ANN remains as if carved in atone her eyes fastened
 on the strangers There is the sound of someone falling
 downstairs and WELLWYN appears also holding a candle above his
 head

ANN Look

WELLWYN Yes yes my dear Itit happened

ANN With a sort of groan Oh Daddy

 In the renewed silence the church clock ceases to chime

FERRAND Softly in his ironic voice HE is come Monsieur Appy
Christmas Bon Noel

 There is a sudden chime of bells The Stage is blotted dark


 Curtain

It is four oclock in the afternoon of New Years Day On the raised
dais MRS MEGAN is standing in her rags with bare feet and ankles
her dark hair as if blown about her lips parted holding out a
dishevelled bunch of violets Before his easel WELLWYN is painting
her Behind him at a table between the cupboard and the door to the
models room TIMSON is washing brushes with the movements of one
employed upon relief works The samovar is hissing on the table by
the stove the tea things are set out

WELLWYN Open your mouth

 MRS MEGAN opens her mouth

ANN In hat and coat entering from the house Daddy

 WELLWYN goes to her and released from restraint MRS MEGAN
 looks round at TIMSON and grimaces

WELLWYN Well my dear

 They speak in low voices

ANN Holding out a note This note from Canon Bentley Hes going
to bring her husband here this afternoon She looks at MRS MEGAN

WELLWYN Oh He also looks at MRS MEGAN

ANN And I met Sir Thomas Hoxton at church this morning and spoke
to him about Timson

WELLWYN Um

 They look at TIMSON Then ANN goes back to the door and
 WELLWYN follows her

ANN Turning Im going round now Daddy to ask Professor Calway
what were to do with that Ferrand

WELLWYN Oh One each I wonder if theyll like it

ANN Theyll have to lump it

 She goes out into the house

WELLWYN Back at his easel You can shut your mouth now

 MRS MEGAN shuts her mouth but opens it immediately to smile

WELLWYN Spasmodically Ah Now thats what I want He dabs
furiously at the canvas Then standing back runs his hands through
his hair and turns a painters glance towards the skylight Dash
Lights gone Off you get childdont tempt me

 MRS MEGAN descends Passing towards the door of the models
 room she stops and stealthily looks at the picture

TIMSON Ah Would yer

WELLWYN Wheeling round Want to have a look Wellcome on

 He takes her by the arm and they stand before the canvas
 After a stolid moment she giggles

WELLWYN Oh You think so

MRS MEGAN Who has lost her hoarseness Its not like my picture
that I had on the pier

WELLWYN Noit wouldnt be

MRS MEGAN Timidly If I had an at on Id look better

WELLWYN With feathers

MRS MEGAN Yes

WELLWYN Well you cant I dont like hats and I dont like
feathers

 MRS MEGAN timidly tugs his sleeve TIMSON screened as he
 thinks by the picture has drawn from his bulky pocket a bottle
 and is taking a stealthy swig

WELLWYN To MRS MEGAN affecting not to notice How much do I owe
you

MRS MEGAN A little surprised You paid me for todayall cept
a penny

WELLWYN Well Here it is He gives her a coin Go and get your
feet on

MRS MEGAN Youve give me arf a crown

WELLWYN Cut away now

 MRS MEGAN smiling at the coin goes towards the models room
 She looks back at WELLWYN as if to draw his eyes to her but he
 is gazing at the picture then catching old TIMSONS sour
 glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little
 squeal But when WELLWYN turns to the sound she is demurely
 passing through the doorway

TIMSON In his voice of dubious sobriety Ive finished these yer
brushes sir Its not a mans work Ive been thinkin if youd
keep an orse I could give yer satisfaction

WELLWYN Would the horse Timson

TIMSON Looking him up and down I knows of one that would just
suit yer Reel orse youd like im

WELLWYN Shaking his head Afraid not Timson Awfully sorry
though to have nothing better for you than this at present

TIMSON Faintly waving the brushes Of course if you cant
afford it I dont press youits only that I feel Im not doing
meself justice Confidentially Theres just one thing sir I
cant bear to see a genleman imposed on That foreigneres not
the sort to ave about the place Talk Oh ah But ell never
do any good with imself Hes a alien

WELLWYN Terrible misfortune to a fellow Timson

TIMSON Dont you believe it sir its his fault I says to the
young lady yesterday Miss Ann your fathers a genleman with a
sudden accent of hoarse sincerity and so you areI dont mind

WELLWYN Indeed

WELLWYN Oh you know it

TIMSON Lived there meself larst three years See the difference a
few days corns made in her Shes that saucy you cant touch er
head

WELLWYN Is there any necessity Timson

TIMSON Artful too Full o vice I caller Wheres er usband

WELLWYN Gravely Come Timson You wouldnt like her to

TIMSON With dignity so that the bottle in his pocket is plainly
visible Im a man as always beared inspection

WELLWYN With a welldirected smile So I see

TIMSON Curving himself round the bottle Its not for me to say
nothingbut I can tell a genleman as quick as ever I can tell an
orse

WELLWYN Painting I find it safest to assume that every man is a
gentleman and every woman a lady Saves no end of selfcontempt
Give me the little brush

TIMSON Handing him the brushafter a considerable introspective
pause Would yer like me to stay and wash it for yer again With
great resolution I willIll do it for younever grudged workin
for a genleman

WELLWYN With sincerity Thank you Timsonvery good of you Im
sure He hands him back the brush Just lend us a hand with this
Assisted by TIMSON he pushes back the dais Lets see What do I
owe you

TIMSON Reluctantly It so appens you advanced me todays
yesterday

WELLWYN Then I suppose you want tomorrows

TIMSON Well I ad to spend it lookin for a permanent job When
youve got to do with orses you cant neglect the publics or you
might as well be dead

WELLWYN Quite so

TIMSON It mounts up in the course o the year

WELLWYN It would Passing him a coin This is for an exceptional
purposeTimsonsee Not

TIMSON Touching his forehead Certainly sir I quite
understand Im not that sort as I think Ive proved to yer comin
here regular day after day all the week Theres one thing I ought
to warn you perhapsI might ave to give this job up any day

 He makes a faint demonstration with the little brush then puts
 it absentmindedly into his pocket

WELLWYN Gravely Id never stand in the way of your bettering
yourself Timson And by the way my daughter spoke to a friend
about you today I think something may come of it

TIMSON Oh Oh She did Well it might do me a bit o good He
makes for the outer door but stops That foreigner E sticks in
my gizzard Its not as if there wasnt plenty o pigeons for im to
pluck in is own Gawdforsaken country Reglar jay thats what I
calls im I could tell yer something

 He has opened the door and suddenly sees that FERRAND himself
 is standing there Sticking out his lower lip TIMSON gives a
 roll of his jaw and lurches forth into the street Owing to a
 slight miscalculation his face and raised arms are plainly
 visible through the window as he fortifies himself from his
 battle against the cold FERRAND having closed the door
 stands with his thumb acting as pointer towards this spectacle
 He is now remarkably dressed in an artists squashy green hat a
 frock coat too small for him a bright blue tie of knitted silk
 the grey trousers that were torn wellworn brown boots and a
 tan waistcoat

WELLWYN What luck today

FERRAND With a shrug Again I have beaten all London Monsieur
not one bite Contemplating himself I think perhaps that for
the bourgeoisie there is a little too much colour in my costume

WELLWYN Contemplating him Lets seeI believe Ive an old top
hat somewhere

FERRAND Ah Monsieur merci but that I could not It is
scarcely in my character

WELLWYN True

FERRAND I have been to merchants of wine of tabac to hotels to
Leicester Square I have been to a Society for spreading Christian
knowledgeI thought there I would have a chance perhaps as
interpreter Toujours meme chose we regret we have no situation
for yousame thing everywhere It seems there is nothing doing in
this town

WELLWYN Ive noticed there never is

FERRAND I was thinking Monsieur that in aviation there might be a
career for mebut it seems one must be trained

WELLWYN Afraid so Ferrand

FERRAND Approaching the picture Ah You are always working at
this You will have something of very good there Monsieur You
wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high
civilisation Cest tres chic ca WELLWYN manifests the quiet
delight of an English artist actually understood In the figures
of these good citizens to whom she offers her flower you would
give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the
wild bird that will surely die within Tres gentil Believe me
Monsieur you have there the greatest comedy of life How anxious
are the tame birds to do the wild birds good His voice changes
For the wild birds it is not funny There is in some human souls
Monsieur what cannot be made tame

WELLWYN I believe you Ferrand

 The face of a young man appears at the window unseen
 Suddenly ANN opens the door leading to the house

ANN DaddyI want you

WELLWYN To FERRAND Excuse me a minute

 He goes to his daughter and they pass out FERRAND remains
 at the picture MRS MEGAN dressed in some of ANNs discarded
 garments has come out of the models room She steals up
 behind FERRAND like a cat reaches an arm up and curls it
 round his mouth He turns and tries to seize her she
 disingenuously slips away He follows The chase circles the
 tea table He catches her lifts her up swings round with
 her so that her feet fly out kisses her bentback face and
 sets her down She stands there smiling The face at the
 window darkens

FERRAND La Valse

 He takes her with both hands by the waist she puts her hands
 against his shoulders to push him ofand suddenly they are
 whirling As they whirl they bob together once or twice and
 kiss Then with a warning motion towards the door she
 wrenches herself free and stops beside the picture trying
 desperately to appear demure WELLWYN and ANN have entered
 The face has vanished

FERRAND Pointing to the picture One does not comprehend all
this Monsieur without well studying I was in train to interpret
for Mamoiselle the chiaroscuro

WELLWYN With a queer look Dont take it too seriously
Ferrand

FERRAND It is a masterpiece

WELLWYN My daughters just spoken to a friend Professor Calway
Hed like to meet you Could you come back a little later

FERRAND Certainly Mamoiselle That will be an opening for me I
trust He goes to the street door

ANN Paying no attention to him Mrs Megan will you too come
back in half an hour

FERRAND Tres bien Mamoiselle I will see that she does We
will take a little promenade together That will do us good

 He motions towards the door MRS MEGAN all eyes follows him
 out

ANN Oh Daddy they are rotters Couldnt you see they were
having the most high jinks

WELLWYN At his picture I seemed to have noticed something

ANN Preparing for tea They were kissing

WELLWYN Tt Tt

ANN Theyre hopeless all threeespecially her Wish I hadnt
given her my clothes now

WELLWYN Absorbed Something of wildsavage

ANN Thank goodness its the Vicars business to see that married
people live together in his parish

WELLWYN Oh Dubiously The Megans are Roman CatholicAtheists
Ann

ANN With heat Then theyre all the more bound WELLWYN gives
a sudden and alarmed whistle

ANN Whats the matter

WELLWYN Didnt you say you spoke to Sir Thomas too Suppose he
comes in while the Professors here Theyre cat and dog

ANN Blankly Oh As WELLWYN strikes a match The samovar is
lighted Taking up the nearly empty decanter of rum and going to
the cupboard Its all right He wont

WELLWYN Well hope not

 He turns back to his picture

ANN At the cupboard Daddy

WELLWYN Hi

ANN There were three bottles

WELLWYN Oh

ANN Well Now there arent any

WELLWYN Abstracted Thatll be Timson

ANN With real horror But its awful

WELLWYN It is my dear

ANN In seven days To say nothing of the stealing

WELLWYN Vexed I blame myselfvery much Ought to have kept it
locked up

ANN You ought to keep him locked up

 There is heard a mild but authoritative knock

WELLWYN Heres the Vicar

ANN What are you going to do about the rum

WELLWYN Opening the door to CANON BERTLEY Come in Vicar
Happy New Year

BERTLEY Same to you Ah Ann Ive got into touch with her
young husbandhes coming round

ANN Still a little out of her plate Thank GoMoses

BERTLEY Faintly surprised From what I hear hes not really a
bad youth Afraid he bets on horses The great thing WELLWYN
with those poor fellows is to put your finger on the weak spot

ANN To herselfgloomily Thats not difficult What would you
do Canon Bertley with a man whos been drinking fathers rum

BERTLEY Remove the temptation of course

WELLWYN Hes done that

BERTLEY Ah ThenWELLWYN and ANN hang on his words then I
shoulder

ANN Abruptly Remove him

BERTLEY Before I say that Ann I must certainly see the
individual

WELLWYN Pointing to the window There he is

 In the failing light TIMSONS face is indeed to be seen
 pressed against the window pane

ANN Daddy I do wish youd have thick glass put in Its so
disgusting to be spied at WELLWYN going quickly to the door has
opened it What do you want TIMSON enters with dignity He is
fuddled

TIMSON Slowly Arskin yer pardonthought it me duty to come
backfound thish yer little brishel on me He produces the little
paint brush

ANN In a deadly voice Nothing else

 TIMSON accords her a glassy stare

WELLWYN Taking the brush hastily Thatll do Timson thanks

TIMSON As I am ere can I do anything for yer

ANN Yes you can sweep out that little room She points to the
models room Theres a broom in there

TIMSON Disagreeably surprised Certainly never make bones
about a little extranever ave in all me life Do it at onsh I
will He moves across to the models room at that peculiar broad
gait so perfectly adjusted to his habits You quite understand me
couldnt bear to ave anything on me that wasnt mine

 He passes out

ANN Old fraud

WELLWYN In and on Mark my words hell restore thebottles

BERTLEY But my dear WELLWYN that is stealing

WELLWYN We all have our discrepancies Vicar

ANN Daddy Discrepancies

WELLWYN Well Ann my theory is that as regards solids Timsons an
Individualist but as regards liquids hes a Socialist or
vice versa according to taste

BERTLEY No no we mustnt joke about it Gravely I do think
he should be spoken to

WELLWYN Yes but not by me

BERTLEY Surely youre the proper person

WELLWYN Shaking his head It was my rum Vicar Look so
personal

 There sound a number of little tattat knocks

WELLWYN Isnt that the Professors knock

 While Ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens
 it There dressed in an ulster stands a thin cleanshaved
 man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking
 off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead
 which completely dominates all that comes below it

WELLWYN Come in Professor So awfully good of you You know
Canon Bentley I think

CALWAY Ah How dyou do

WELLWYN Your opinion will be invaluable Professor

ANN Tea Professor Calway

 They have assembled round the tea table

CALWAY Thank you no tea milk

WELLWYN Rum

 He pours rum into CALWAYs milk

CALWAY A littlethanks Turning to ANN You were going to show
me some one youre trying to rescue or something I think

ANN Oh Yes Hell be here directlysimply perfect rotter

CALWAY Smiling Really Ah I think you said he was a
congenital

WELLWYN With great interest What

ANN Low Daddy To CALWAY Yes II think thats what you
call him

CALWAY Not old

ANN No and quite healthya vagabond

CALWAY Sipping I see Yes Is it do you think chronic
unemployment with a vagrant tendency Or would it be nearer the
mark to say Vagrancy

WELLWYN Pure Oh pure Professor Awfully human

CALWAY With a smile of knowledge Quite Ander

ANN Breaking in Before he comes theres another

BERTLEY Blandly Yes when you came in we were discussing what
should be done with a man who drinks rumCALWAY pauses in the act
of drinkingthat doesnt belong to him

CALWAY Really Dipsomaniac

BERTLEY Wellperhaps you could tell usdrink certainly changing
thine to mine The Professor could see him WELLWYN

ANN Rising Yes do come and look at him Professor CALWAY
Hes in there

 She points towards the models room CALWAY smiles
 deprecatingly

ANN No really we neednt open the door You can see him through
the glass Hes more than half

CALWAY Well I hardly

ANN Oh Do Come on Professor CALWAY We must know what to do
with him CALWAY rises You can stand on a chair Its all
science

 She draws CALWAY to the models room which is lighted by a
 glass panel in the top of the high door CANON BERTLEY also
 rises and stands watching WELLWYN hovers torn between
 respect for science and dislike of espionage

ANN Drawing up a chair Come on

CALWAY Do you seriously wish me to

ANN Rather Its quite safe he cant see you

CALWAY But he might come out

 ANN puts her back against the door CALWAY mounts the chair
 dubiously and raises his head cautiously bending it more and
 more downwards

ANN Well

CALWAY He appears to besitting on the floor

WELLWYN Yes thats all right

 BERTLEY covers his lips

CALWAY To ANNdescending By the look of his face as far as
one can see it I should say there was a leaning towards mania I
know the treatment

 There come three loud knocks on the door WELLWYN and ANN
 exchange a glance of consternation

ANN Whos that

WELLWYN It sounds like Sir Thomas

CALWAY Sir Thomas Hoxton

WELLWYN Nodding Awfully sorry Professor You see we

CALWAY Not at all Only I must decline to be involved in
argument with him please

BERTLEY He has experience We might get his opinion dont you
think

CALWAY On a point of reform A JP

BERTLEY Deprecating My dear Sirwe neednt take it

 The three knocks resound with extraordinary fury

ANN Youd better open the door Daddy

 WELLWYN opens the door SIR THOMAS HOXTON is disclosed in a
 fur overcoat and top hat His square wellcoloured face is
 remarkable for a massive jaw dominating all that comes above
 it His Voice is resolute

HOXTON Afraid I didnt make myself heard

WELLWYN So good of you to come Sir Thomas Canon Bertley They
greet Professor CALWAY you know I think

HOXTON Ominously I do

 They almost greet An awkward pause

ANN Blurting it out That old cabman I told you ofs been
drinking fathers rum

BERTLEY We were just discussing whats to be done with him Sir
Thomas One wants to do the very best of course The question of
reform is always delicate

CALWAY I beg your pardon There is no question here

HOXTON Abruptly Oh Is he in the house

ANN In there

HOXTON Works for you eh

WELLWYN Eryes

HOXTON Lets have a look at him

 An embarrassed pause

BERTLEY Wellthe fact is Sir Thomas

CALWAY When last under observation

ANN He was sitting on the floor

WELLWYN I dont want the old fellow to feel hes being made a show
of Disgusting to be spied at Ann

ANN You cant Daddy Hes drunk

HOXTON Never mind Miss WELLWYN Hundreds of these fellows before
me in my time At CALWAY The only thing is a sharp lesson

CALWAY I disagree Ive seen the man what he requires is steady
control and the bobbins treatment

 WELLWYN approaches them with fearful interest

HOXTON Not a bit of it He wants one for his knob Brace em up
Its the only thing

BERTLEY Personally I think that if he were spoken to seriously

CALWAY I cannot walk arm in arm with a crab

HOXTON Approaching CALWAY I beg your pardon

CALWAY Moving back a little Youre moving backwards Sir
Thomas Ive told you before convinced reactionaryism in these
days

 There comes a single knock on the street door

BERTLEY Looking at his watch Dyou know Im rather afraid
this may be our young husband WELLWYN I told him halfpast four

WELLWYN Oh Ah Yes Going towards the two reformers Shall
we go into the house Professor and settle the question quietly
while the Vicar sees a young man

CALWAY Pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating
insensibly in the direction indicated The merest sense of
continuitya simple instinct for order

HOXTON Following The only way to get order sir is to bring
the disorderly up with a round turn CALWAY turns to him in the
doorway You people without practical experience

CALWAY If youll listen to me a minute

HOXTON I can show you in a mo

 They vanish through the door

WELLWYN I was afraid of it

BERTLEY The two points of view Pleasant to see such keenness
I may want you WELLWYN And Ann perhaps had better not be present

WELLWYN Relieved Quite so My dear

 ANN goes reluctantly WELLWYN opens the street door The
 lamp outside has just been lighted and by its gleam is seen
 the figure of RORY MEGAN thin pale youthful ANN turning at
 the door into the house gives him a long inquisitive look
 then goes

WELLWYN Is that Megan

MEGAN Yus

WELLWYN Come in

 MEGAN comes in There follows an awkward silence during
 which WELLWYN turns up the light then goes to the tea table
 and pours out a glass of tea and rum

BERTLEY Kindly Now my boy how is it that you and your wife

MEGAN I dunno

BERTLEY Well if you dont none of us are very likely to are we

MEGAN She never let me know it

WELLWYN Well now come Here she is

 He points to the door and stands regarding MEGAN with his
 friendly smile

MEGAN With a gleam of responsiveness I might perhaps to
please you sir

BERTLEY Appropriating the gesture Capital I thought we should
get on in time

MEGAN Yus

 WELLWYN opens the door MRS MEGAN and FERRAND are revealed
 They are about to enter but catching sight of MEGAN
 hesitate

BERTLEY Come in Come in

 MRS MEGAN enters stolidly FERRAND following stands apart
 with an air of extreme detachment MEGAN after a quick glance
 at them both remains unmoved No one has noticed that the
 door of the models room has been opened and that the unsteady
 figure of old TIMSON is standing there

BERTLEY A little awkward in the presence of FERRANDto the
MEGANS This begins a new chapter We wont improve the occasion
No need

 MEGAN turning towards his wife makes her a gesture as if to
 say Here lets get out of this

BENTLEY Yes yes youll like to get home at onceI know He
holds up his hand mechanically

TIMSON I forbids the banns

BERTLEY Startled Gracious

TIMSON Extremely unsteady Just cause and impejiment There e

WELLWYN Timson

BERTLEY Is this the rum

TIMSON Struck by the word Im a teetotaler

WELLWYN Timson Timson

TIMSON Seein as theres ladies present I wont be conspicuous

 He jerks his chin at FERRAND turns slowly on his heel and
 goes out into the street

 There follows a profound silence

ANN What did I say Daddy Utter All three

 Suddenly alive to her presence they all turn

TIMSON Waking up and looking round him Well praps Id better

 Assisted by WELLWYN he lurches gingerly off the dais towards
 the door which WELLWYN holds open for him

TIMSON Mechanically Where to sir

 Receiving no answer he passes out touching his hat and the
 door is closed

WELLWYN Ann

 ANN goes back whence she came

 BERTLEY steadily regarding MRS MEGAN who has put her arm up
 in front of her face beckons to FERRAND and the young man
 comes gravely forward

BERTLEY Young people this is very dreadful MRS MEGAN lowers
her arm a little and looks at him over it Very sad

MRS MEGAN Dropping her arm Megans no better than what I am

BERTLEY Come come Heres your home broken up MRS MEGAN
Smiles Shaking his head gravely Surelysurelyyou mustnt

FERRAND Believe me Monsieur I greatly regret

BERTLEY Im glad to hear it

FERRAND If I had foreseen this disaster

BERTLEY Is that your only reason for regret

FERRAND With a little bow Any reason that you wish Monsieur
I will do my possible

MRS MEGAN I could get an unfurnished room if she slides her eyes
round at WELLWYN I ad the money to furnish it

BERTLEY But suppose I can induce your husband to forgive you and
take you back

MRS MEGAN Shaking her head Ed it me

BERTLEY I said to forgive

MRS MEGAN That wouldnt make no difference With a flash at
BERTLEY An I aint forgiven him

BERTLEY That is sinful

MRS MEGAN Im a Catholic

BERTLEY My good child what difference does that make

FERRAND Monsieur if I might interpret for her

 BERTLEY silences him with a gesture

MRS MEGAN Sliding her eyes towards WELLWYN If I ad the money
to buy some fresh stock

BERTLEY Yes yes never mind the money What I want to find in
you both is repentance

MRS MEGAN With a flash up at him I cant get me livin off of
repentin

BERTLEY Now now Never say what you know to be wrong

FERRAND Monsieur her soul is very simple

BERTLEY Severely I do not know sir that we shall get any
great assistance from your views In fact one thing is clear to
me she must discontinue your acquaintanceship at once

FERRAND Certainly Monsieur We have no serious intentions

BERTLEY All the more shame to you then

FERRAND Monsieur I see perfectly your point of view It is very
natural He bows and is silent

MRS MEGAN I dont wantim hurtcos o me Meganll get his mates
to belt himbein foreign like he is

BERTLEY Yes never mind that Its you Im thinking of

MRS MEGAN Id sooner theyd hit me

WELLWYN Suddenly Well said my child

MRS MEGAN Twasnt his fault

FERRAND Without ironyto WELLWYN I cannot accept that
Monsieur The blameit is all mine

ANN Entering suddenly from the house Daddy theyre having an
awful

 The voices of PROFESSOR CALWAY and SIR THOMAS HOXTON are
 distinctly heard

CALWAY The question is a much wider one Sir Thomas

HOXTON As wide as you like youll never

 WELLWYN pushes ANN back into the house and closes the door
 behind her The voices are still faintly heard arguing on the
 threshold

BERTLEY Let me go in here a minute Wellyn I must finish
speaking to her He motions MRS MEGAN towards the models room
We cant leave the matter thus

FERRAND Suavely Do you desire my company Monsieur

 BERTLEY with a prohibitive gesture of his hand shepherds the
 reluctant MRS MEGAN into the models room

WELLWYN Sorrowfully You shouldnt have done this Ferrand It
wasnt the square thing

FERRAND With dignity Monsieur I feel that I am in the wrong
It was stronger than me

 As he speaks SIR THOMAS HOXTON and PROFESSOR CALWAY enter
 from the house In the dim light and the full cry of
 argument they do not notice the figures at the fire SIR
 THOMAS HOXTON leads towards the street door

HOXTON No Sir I repeat if the country once commits itself to
your views of reform its as good as doomed

CALWAY I seem to have heard that before Sir Thomas And let me
say at once that your hittymissy cartload of bricks regime

HOXTON Is a deuced sight better sir than your grandmotherly
methods What the old fellow wants is a shock With all this
socialistic mollycoddling youre losing sight of the individual

CALWAY Swiftly You sir with your devil take the hindmost
have never even seen him

 SIR THOMAS HOXTON throwing back a gesture of disgust steps
 out into the night and falls heavily PROFESSOR CALWAY
 hastening to his rescue falls more heavily still

 TIMSON momentarily roused from slumber on the doorstep sits
 up

HOXTON Struggling to his knees Damnation

CALWAY Sitting How simultaneous

 WELLWYN and FERRAND approach hastily

FERRAND Pointing to TIMSON Monsieur it was true it seems
They had lost sight of the individual

 A Policeman has appeared under the street lamp He picks up
 HOXTONS hat

CONSTABLE Anything wrong sir

HOXTON Recovering his feet Wrong Great Scott Constable
Why do you let things lie about in the street like this Look here
Wellyn

 They all scrutinize TIMSON

WELLWYN Its only the old fellow whose reform you were discussing

HOXTON How did he come here

CONSTABLE Drunk sir Ascertaining TIMSON to be in the street
Just off the premises by good luck Come along father

TIMSON Assisted to his feetdrowsily Certnly by no means
take my arm

 They move from the doorway HOXTON and CALWAY reenter and
 go towards the fire

ANN Entering from the house Whats happened

CALWAY Might we have a brush

HOXTON Testily Let it dry

 He moves to the fire and stands before it PROFESSOR CALWAY
 following stands a little behind him ANN returning begins to
 brush the PROFESSORs sleeve

WELLWYN Turning from the door where he has stood looking after
the receding TIMSON Poor old Timson

ACT III

It is the first of Aprila white spring day of gleams and driving
showers The street door of WELLWYNs studio stands wide open and
past it in the street the wind is whirling bits of straw and paper
bags Through the door can be seen the butt end of a stationary
furniture van with its flap let down To this van three humblemen
in shirt sleeves and aprons are carrying out the contents of the
studio The hissing samovar the teapot the sugar and the nearly
empty decanter of rum stand on the low round table in the
fastbeinggutted room WELLWYN in his ulster and soft hat is
squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire staring
into it and smoking a handmade cigarette He has a moulting air
Behind him the humblemen pass embracing busts and other articles
of vertu

CHIEF HMAN Stopping and standing in the attitude of
expectation Weve about pinched this little lot sir Shall we
take thereservoir

 He indicates the samovar

WELLWYN Ah Abstractedly feeling in his pockets and finding
coins Thanksthanksheavy work Im afraid

HMAN Receiving the coinsa little surprised and a good deal
pleased Thankee sir Much obliged Im sure Well ave to
come back for this He gives the dais a vigorous push with his
foot Not a fixture as I understand Perhaps youd like us to
leave these ere for a bit He indicates the tea things

WELLWYN Ah do

 The humblemen go out There is the sound of horses being
 started and the butt end of the van disappears WELLWYN stays
 on his stool smoking and brooding over the fare The open
 doorway is darkened by a figure CANON BERTLEY is standing
 there

BERTLEY WELLWYN WELLWYN turns and rises Its ages since I
saw you No idea you were moving This is very dreadful

WELLWYN Yes Ann found thistoo exposed That tall house in
Flight Streetwere going there Seventh floor

 WELLWYN shakes his head

BERTLEY Dear me No lift Fine view no doubt WELLWYN nods

WELLWYN So Ann thinks Vicar whats become of that little
flowerseller I was painting at Christmas You took her into

BERTLEY Not weexactly Some dear friends of ours Painful

WELLWYN Oh

BERTLEY Yes She got the footman into trouble

WELLWYN Did she now

BERTLEY Disappointing I consulted with CALWAY and he advised me
to try a certain institution We got her safely inexcellent
place but dyou know she broke out three weeks ago And since
Ive heard he holds his hands up hopeless Im afraidquite

WELLWYN I thought I saw her last night You cant tell me her
address I suppose

BERTLEY Shaking his head The husband too has quite passed out
of my ken He betted on horses you remember Im sometimes
tempted to believe theres nothing for some of these poor folk but
to pray for death

 ANN has entered from the house Her hair hangs from under a
 knitted cap She wears a white wool jersey and a loose silk
 scarf

BERTLEY Ah Ann I was telling your father of that poor little
Mrs Megan

ANN Is she dead

BERTLEY Worse I fear By the waywhat became of her accomplice

ANN We havent seen him since She looks searchingly at
WELLWYN At leasthave youDaddy

WELLWYN Rather hurt No my dear I have not

BERTLEY And theold gentleman who drank the rum

ANN He got fourteen days It was the fifth time

BERTLEY Dear me

ANN When he came out he got more drunk than ever Rather a score
for Professor Calway wasnt it

BERTLEY I remember He and Sir Thomas took a kindly interest in
the old fellow

ANN Yes they fell over him The Professor got him into an
Institution

BERTLEY Indeed

ANN He was perfectly sober all the time he was there

WELLWYN My dear they only allow them milk

ANN Well anyway he was reformed

WELLWYN Yeyes

ANN Terribly Daddy Youve been seeing him

WELLWYN With dignity My dear I have not

ANN How do you know then

WELLWYN Came across Sir Thomas on the Embankment yesterday told
me old Timsohad been had up again for sitting down in front of a
brewers dray

ANN Why

WELLWYN Well you see as soon as he came out of the what dyou
call em he got drunk for a week and it left him in low spirits

BERTLEY Do you mean he deliberately sat down with the
intentionofer

WELLWYN Said he was tired of life but they didnt believe him

ANN Rather a score for Sir Thomas I suppose hed told the
Professor What did he say

WELLWYN Well the Professor said with a quick glance at BERTLEY
he felt there was nothing for some of these poor devils but a lethal
chamber

BERTLEY Shocked Did he really

He has not yet caught WELLWYN s glance

WELLWYN And Sir Thomas agreed Historic occasion And you Vicar
Hm

 BERTLEY winces

ANN To herself Well there isnt

BERTLEY And yet Some good in the old fellow no doubt if one
could put ones finger on it Preparing to go Youll let us
know then when youre settled What was the address WELLWYN
takes out and hands him a card Ah yes Goodbye Ann
Goodbye Wellyn The wind blows his hat along the street What
a wind He goes pursuing

ANN Who has eyed the card askance Daddy have you told those
other two where were going

WELLWYN Which other two my dear

ANN The Professor and Sir Thomas

WELLWYN Well Ann naturally I

ANN Jumping on to the dais with disgust Oh dear When Im
trying to get you away from all this atmosphere I dont so much
mind the Vicar knowing because hes got a weak heart

 She jumps off again 

WELLWYN To himself Seventh floor I felt there was something

ANN Preparing to go Im going round now But you must stay
here till the van comes back And dont forget you tipped the men
after the first load

WELLWYN Oh Yes yes Uneasily Good sorts they look those
fellows

ANN Scrutinising him What have you done

WELLWYN Nothing my dear really

ANN What

WELLWYN II rather think I may have tipped them twice

ANN Drily Daddy If it is the first of April its not
necessary to make a fool of oneself Thats the last time you ever
do these ridiculous things WELLWYN eyes her askance Im going
to see that you spend your money on yourself You neednt look at
me like that I mean to As soon as Ive got you away from here
and allthese

WELLWYN Dont rub it in Ann

ANN Giving him a sudden hugthen going to the doorwith a sort
of triumph Deeds not words Daddy

 She goes out and the wind catching her scarf blows it out
 beneath her firm young chin WELLWYN returning to the fire
 stands brooding and gazing at his extinct cigarette

WELLWYN To himself Bad lotlow type No method No theory

 In the open doorway appear FERRAND and MRS MEGAN They
 stand unseen looking at him FERRAND is more ragged if
 possible than on Christmas Eve His chin and cheeks are
 clothed in a reddish golden beard MRS MEGANs dress is not
 so woebegone but her face is white her eyes darkcircled
 They whisper She slips back into the shadow of the doorway
 WELLWYN turns at the sound and stares at FERRAND in
 amazement

FERRAND Advancing Enchanted to see you Monsieur He looks
round the empty room You are leaving

WELLWYN Noddingthen taking the young mans hand How goes it

FERRAND Displaying himself simply As you see Monsieur I
have done of my best It still flies from me

WELLWYN Sadlyas if against his will Ferrand it will always
fly

 The young foreigner shivers suddenly from head to foot then
 controls himself with a great effort

FERRAND Dont say that Monsieur It is too much the echo of my
heart

WELLWYN Forgive me I didnt mean to pain you

FERRAND Drawing nearer the fire That old cabby Monsieur you
rememberthey tell me he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the
other day

 WELLWYN nods

FERRAND And those Sirs so interested in him with their theories
He has worn them out WELLWYN nods That goes without saying
And now they wish for him the lethal chamber

WELLWYN Startled How did you know that

 There is silence

FERRAND Staring into the fire Monsieur while I was on the
road this time I fell ill of a fever It seemed to me in my illness
that I saw the truthhow I was wasting in this worldI would never
be good for any onenor any one for meall would go by and I
never of itfame and fortune and peace even the necessities of
life ever mocking me

 He draws closer to the fire spreading his fingers to the
 flame And while he is speaking through the doorway MRS
 MEGAN creeps in to listen

FERRAND Speaking on into the fire And I saw Monsieur so
plain that I should be vagabond all my days and my days short I
dying in the end the death of a dog I saw it all in my fever
clear as that flamethere was nothing for us others but the herb
of death WELLWYN takes his arm and presses it And so
Monsieur I wished to die I told no one of my fever I lay out on
the groundit was verree cold But they would not let me die on
the roads of their parishesthey took me to an Institution
Monsieur I looked in their eyes while I lay there and I saw more
clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that I should
die although they would not let me Then Monsieur naturally my
spirit rose and I said So much the worse for you I will live a
little more One is made like that Life is sweet Monsieur

WELLWYN Yes Ferrand Life is sweet

FERRAND That little girl you had here Monsieur WELLWYN nods
in her too there is something of wildsavage She must have joy of
life I have seen her since I came back She has embraced the life
of joy It is not quite the same thing He lowers his voice
She is lost Monsieur as a stone that sinks in water I can see
if she cannot As WELLWYN makes a movement of distress Oh I
am not to blame for that Monsieur It had well begun before I knew
her

WELLWYN Yes yesI was afraid of it at the time

 MRS MEGAN turns silently and slips away

FEERRAND I do my best for her Monsieur but look at me Besides
I am not good for herit is not good for simple souls to be with
those who see things clear For the great part of mankind to see
anythingis fatal

WELLWYN Even for you it seems

FERRAND No Monsieur To be so near to death has done me good I
shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave
Since I saw you Monsieur I have been in three Institutions They
are palaces One may eat upon the floorthough it is truefor
Kingsthey eat too much of skilly there One little thing they
lackthose palaces It is understanding of the uman heart In
them tame birds pluck wild birds naked

WELLWYN They mean well

FERRAND Ah Monsieur I am loafer wasterwhat you likefor all
that bitterly poverty is my only crime If I were rich should
I not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above
commerce travelling to see the world And that young girl would
she not be that charming ladee veree chic you know And the
old Timsgood oldfashioned gentlemandrinking his liquor well
Eh bienwhat are we now Dark beasts despised by all That is
life Monsieur He stares into the fire

WELLWYN Were our own enemies Ferrand I can afford ityou
cant Quite true

FERRAND Earnestly Monsieur do you know this You are the
sole being that can do us goodwe hopeless ones

WELLWYN Shaking his head Not a bit of it Im hopeless too

FERRAND Eagerly Monsieur it is just that You understand
When we are with you we feel somethingherehe touches his
heart If I had one prayer to make it would be Good God give me
to understand Those sirs with their theories they can clean our
skins and chain our abitsthat soothes for them the aesthetic
sense it gives them too their good little importance But our
spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand Without
that Monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange

WELLWYN Dont be so bitter Think of all the work they do

FERRAND Monsieur of their industry I say nothing They do a good
work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame
old and the good unfortunate deserving Above all to the little
children But Monsieur when all is done there are always us
hopeless ones What can they do with me Monsieur with that girl
or with that old man Ah Monsieur we too ave our qualities
we othersit wants you courage to undertake a career like mine or
like that young girls We wild oneswe know a thousand times more
of life than ever will those sirs They waste their time trying to
make rooks white Be kind to us if you will or let us alone like
Mees Ann but do not try to change our skins Leave us to live or
leave us to die when we like in the free air If you do not wish of
us you have but to shut your pockets andyour doorswe shall die
the faster

WELLWYN With agitation But that you knowwe cant donow
can we

FERRAND If you cannot how is it our fault The harm we do to
othersis it so much If I am criminal dangerousshut me up
I would not pity myselfnevare But we in whom something moves
like that flame Monsieur that cannot keep stillwe otherswe are
not manythat must have motion in our lives do not let them make
us prisoners with their theories because we are not like themit
is life itself they would enclose He draws up his tattered
figure then bending over the fire again I ask your pardon I am
talking If I could smoke Monsieur

 WELLWYN hands him a tobacco pouch and he rolls a cigarette
 with his yellowStained fingers

FERRAND The good God made me so that I would rather walk a whole
month of nights hungry with the stars than sit one single day
making round business on an office stool It is not to my
advantage I cannot help it that I am a vagabond What would you
have It is stronger than me He looks suddenly at WELLWYN
Monsieur I say to you things I have never said

WELLWYN Quietly Go on go on There is silence

FERRAND Suddenly Monsieur Are you really English The
English are so civilised

WELLWYN And am I not

FERRAND You treat me like a brother

 WELLWYN has turned towards the street door at a sound of feet
 and the clamour of voices

TIMSON From the street Take her in ere I knows im

 Through the open doorway come a POLICE CONSTABLE and a LOAFER
 bearing between them the limp white faced form of MRS MEGAN
 hatless and with drowned hair enveloped in the policemans
 waterproof Some curious persons bring up the rear jostling
 in the doorway among whom is TIMSON carrying in his hands the
 policemans dripping waterproof leg pieces

FERRAND Starting forward Monsieur it is that little girl

WELLWYN Whats happened Constable Whats happened

 The CONSTABLE and LOAFER have laid the body down on the dais
 with WELLWYN and FERRAND they stand bending over her

CONSTABLE Tempted sooicide sir but she hadnt been in the water
arf a minute when I got hold of her He bends lower Cant
understand her collapsin like this

WELLWYN Feeling her heart I dont feel anything

FERRAND In a voice sharpened by emotion Let me try Monsieur

CONSTABLE Touching his arm You keep off my lad

WELLWYN No constablelet him Hes her friend

CONSTABLE Releasing FERRANDto the LOAFER Here you Cut off
for a doctorsharp now He pushes back the curious persons Now
then stand away there pleasewe cant have you round the body
Keep backClear out now

 He slowly moves them back and at last shepherds them through
 the door and shuts it on them TIMSON being last

FERRAND The rum

 WELLWYN fetches the decanter With the little there is left
 FERRAND chafes the girls hands and forehead and pours some
 between her lips But there is no response from the inert
 body

FERRAND Her soul is still away Monsieur

 WELLWYN seizing the decanter pours into it tea and boiling
 water

CONSTABLE Its never drownin sirher head was hardly under I
was on to her like knife

FERRAND Rubbing her feet She has not yet her philosophy
Monsieur at the beginning they often try If she is dead In a
voice of awed rapture What fortune

CONSTABLE With puzzled sadness True enough sirthat Wed
just begun to know er If she as been takenher best friends
couldnt wish er better

WELLWYN Applying the decanter to her dips Poor little thing
Ill try this hot tea

FERRAND Whispering La mortle grand ami

WELLWYN Look Look at her Shes coming round

 A faint tremor passes over MRS MEGANs body He again
 applies the hot drink to her mouth She stirs and gulps

CONSTABLE With intense relief Thats brave Good lass
Shell pick up now sir

 Then seeing that TIMSON and the curious persons have again
 opened the door he drives them out and stands with his back
 against it MRS MEGAN comes to herself

WELLWYN Sitting on the dais and supporting heras if to a
child There you are my dear There therebetter now Thats
right Drink a little more of this tea

 MRS MEGAN drinks from the decanter

FERRAND Rising Bring her to the fire Monsieur

 They take her to the fire and seat her on the little stool
 From the moment of her restored animation FERRAND has resumed
 his air of cynical detachment and now stands apart with arms
 folded watching

WELLWYN Feeling better my child

MRS MEGAN Yes

WELLWYN Thats good Thats good Now how was it Um

MRS MEGAN I dunno She shivers I was standin here just now

her head at FERRAND I feel better now Ive been in the water
She smiles and shivers

WELLWYN There there Shivery Like to walk up and down a

WELLWYN Beastly when your head goes under

MRS MEGAN Yes It frightened me I thought I wouldnt come up

WELLWYN I knowsort of world without end wasnt it What did

MRS MEGAN I wished I adnt jumpedan I thought of my baby

 Her mouth quivers her face puckers she gives a choke and a
 little sob

WELLWYN Stopping and stroking her There therethere

 For a moment her face is buried in his sleeve then she
 recovers herself

MRS MEGAN Then e got hold o me an pulled me out

WELLWYN Ah what a comfortum

MRS MEGAN Yes The water got into me mouth

 They walk again I wouldnt have gone to do it but for him
 She looks towards FERRAND His talk made me feel all funny

WELLWYN My dear child Dont think such things As if anyone

MRS MEGAN Stolidly I thought they did They used to look at
me so sometimes where I was before I ran awayI couldnt stop

WELLWYN No shivers and no aches quite comfy

MRS MEGAN Yes

CONSTABLE Who has remained discreetly apart at the
doorcordially First rate sir Thats capital He approaches

CONSTABLE With more decision Ill have to charge her sir

WELLWYN Good God You dont mean to say the poor little thing has

CONSTABLE Consulting with him Well sir we cant get over the

its an awkward job

WELLWYN Calming himself with an effort But look here
Constable as a reasonable manThis poor wretched little girlyou

credit to try and jump out of it

 The CONSTABLE shakes his head

WELLWYN You said yourself her best friends couldnt wish her

Vicar was here a few minutes ago saying the very same thingthe
Vicar Constable The CONSTABLE shakes his head Ah now look

CONSTABLE I quite appreciate your good eart sir an you make it

 WELLWYN raises his hat and plunges his fingers through and
 through his hair

WELLWYN Well God in heaven Of all the dd topsyturvy
Not a soul in the world wants her aliveand now shes to be
prosecuted for trying to be where everyone wishes her

CONSTABLE Come sir come Be a man

 Throughout all this MRS MEGAN has sat stolidly before the
 fire but as FERRAND suddenly steps forward she looks up at
 him

FERRAND Do not grieve Monsieur This will give her courage
There is nothing that gives more courage than to see the irony of
things He touches MRS MEGANS shoulder Go my child it will
do you good

 MRS MEGAN rises and looks at him dazedly

CONSTABLE Coming forward and taking her by the hand Thats my
good lass Come along We wont hurt you

MRS MEGAN I dont want to go Theyll stare at me

CONSTABLE Comforting Not they Ill see to that

WELLWYN Very upset Take her in a cab Constable if you must

WELLWYN No no I know Youre a good sort

CONSTABLE Comfortable Dont you take on sir Its her first
try they wont be hard on er Like as not only bind er over in
her own recogs not to do it again Come my dear

MRS MEGAN Trying to free herself from the policemans cloak I
want to take this off It looks so funny

 As she speaks the door is opened by ANN behind whom is dimly
 seen the form of old TIMSON still heading the curious
 persons

ANN Looking from one to the other in amazement What is it
Whats happened Daddy

FERRAND Out of the silence It is nothing Mamoiselle She
has failed to drown herself They run her in a little

WELLWYN Lend her your jacket my dear shell catch her death

 ANN feeling MRS MEGANs arm strips of her jacket and helps
 her into it without a word

CONSTABLE Donning his cloak Thank you Missvery good of
you Im sure

MRS MEGAN Mazed Its warm

 She gives them all a last halfsmiling look and Passes with
 the CONSTABLE through the doorway

FERRAND That makes the third of us Monsieur We are not in luck
To wish us dead it seems is easier than to let us die

 He looks at ANN who is standing with her eyes fixed on her
 father WELLWYN has taken from his pocket a visiting card

WELLWYN To FERRAND Here quick take this run after her When
theyve done with her tell her to come to us

FERRAND Taking the card and reading the address No 7 Haven
House Flight Street Rely on me MonsieurI will bring her
myself to call on you Au revoir mon bon Monsieur

 He bends over WELLWYNs hand then with a bow to ANN goes
 out his tattered figure can be seen through the window
 passing in the wind WELLWYN turns back to the fire The
 figure of TIMSON advances into the doorway no longer holding
 in either hand a waterproof legpiece

TIMSON In a croaky voice Sir

WELLWYN Whatyou Timson

TIMSON On me larst legs sir Ere You can see em for yerself
Shawnt trouble yer long

WELLWYN After a long and desperate stare Not nowTIMSON not
now Take this He takes out another card and hands it to
TIMSON Some other time

TIMSON Taking the card Yer new address You are a genleman
He lurches slowly away

 ANN shuts the street door and sets her back against it The
 rumble of the approaching van is heard outside It ceases

ANN In a fateful voice Daddy They stare at each other Do
you know what youve done Given your card to those six rotters

WELLWYN With a blank stare Six

ANN Staring round the naked room What was the good of this

WELLWYN Following her eyesvery gravely Ann It is stronger
than me

 Without a word ANN opens the door and walks straight out
 With a heavy sigh WELLWYN sinks down on the little stool
 before the fire The three humblemen come in

CHIEF HUMBLEMAN In an attitude of expectation This is the
larst of it sir

WELLWYN Oh Ah yes

 He gives them money then something seems to strike him and
 he exhibits certain signs of vexation Suddenly he recovers
 looks from one to the other and then at the tea things A
 faint smile comes on his face

WELLWYN You can finish the decanter

 He goes out in haste

CHIEF HUMBLEMAN Clinking the coins Third time of arskin
April fool Not arf Good old pigeon

SECOND HUMBLEMAN Uman being I call im

CHIEF HUMBLEMAN Taking the three glasses from the last
