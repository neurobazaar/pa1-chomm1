Mending Wall

 SOMETHING there is that doesnt love a wall
 That sends the frozengroundswell under it
 And spills the upper boulders in the sun
 And makes gaps even two can pass abreast
 The work of hunters is another thing
 I have come after them and made repair
 Where they have left not one stone on a stone
 But they would have the rabbit out of hiding
 To please the yelping dogs The gaps I mean
 No one has seen them made or heard them made
 But at spring mendingtime we find them there
 I let my neighbour know beyond the hill
 And on a day we meet to walk the line
 And set the wall between us once again
 We keep the wall between us as we go
 To each the boulders that have fallen to each
 And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
 We have to use a spell to make them balance
 Stay where you are until our backs are turned
 We wear our fingers rough with handling them
 Oh just another kind of outdoor game
 One on a side It comes to little more
 There where it is we do not need the wall
 He is all pine and I am apple orchard
 My apple trees will never get across
 And eat the cones under his pines I tell him
 He only says Good fences make good neighbours
 Spring is the mischief in me and I wonder
 If I could put a notion in his head
 Why do they make good neighbours Isnt it
 Where there are cows But here there are no cows
 Before I built a wall Id ask to know
 What I was walling in or walling out
 And to whom I was like to give offence
 Something there is that doesnt love a wall
 That wants it down I could say Elves to him
 But its not elves exactly and Id rather
 He said it for himself I see him there
 Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
 In each hand like an oldstone savage armed
 He moves in darkness as it seems to me
 Not of woods only and the shade of trees
 He will not go behind his fathers saying
 And he likes having thought of it so well
 He says again Good fences make good neighbours




The Death of the Hired Man

 MARY sat musing on the lampflame at the table
 Waiting for Warren When she heard his step
 She ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage
 To meet him in the doorway with the news
 And put him on his guard Silas is back
 She pushed him outward with her through the door
 And shut it after her Be kind she said
 She took the market things from Warrens arms
 And set them on the porch then drew him down
 To sit beside her on the wooden steps
 When was I ever anything but kind to him
 But Ill not have the fellow back he said
 I told him so last haying didnt I
 If he left then I said that ended it
 What good is he Who else will harbour him
 At his age for the little he can do
 What help he is theres no depending on
 Off he goes always when I need him most
 He thinks he ought to earn a little pay
 Enough at least to buy tobacco with
 So he wont have to beg and be beholden
 All right I say I cant afford to pay
 Any fixed wages though I wish I could
 Someone else can Then someone else will have to
 I shouldnt mind his bettering himself
 If that was what it was You can be certain
 When he begins like that theres someone at him
 Trying to coax him off with pocketmoney
 In haying time when any help is scarce
 In winter he comes back to us Im done
 Sh not so loud hell hear you Mary said
 I want him to hell have to soon or late
 Hes worn out Hes asleep beside the stove
 When I came up from Rowes I found him here
 Huddled against the barndoor fast asleep
 A miserable sight and frightening too
 You neednt smileI didnt recognise him
 I wasnt looking for himand hes changed
 Wait till you see
 Where did you say hed been
 He didnt say I dragged him to the house
 And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke
 I tried to make him talk about his travels
 Nothing would do he just kept nodding off
 What did he say Did he say anything
 But little
 Anything Mary confess
 He said hed come to ditch the meadow for me
 Warren
 But did he I just want to know
 Of course he did What would you have him say
 Surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man
 Some humble way to save his selfrespect
 He added if you really care to know
 He meant to clear the upper pasture too
 That sounds like something you have heard before
 Warren I wish you could have heard the way
 He jumbled everything I stopped to look
 Two or three timeshe made me feel so queer
 To see if he was talking in his sleep
 He ran on Harold Wilsonyou remember
 The boy you had in haying four years since
 Hes finished school and teaching in his college
 Silas declares youll have to get him back
 He says they two will make a team for work
 Between them they will lay this farm as smooth
 The way he mixed that in with other things
 He thinks young Wilson a likely lad though daft
 On educationyou know how they fought
 All through July under the blazing sun
 Silas up on the cart to build the load
 Harold along beside to pitch it on
 Yes I took care to keep well out of earshot
 Well those days trouble Silas like a dream
 You wouldnt think they would How some things linger
 Harolds young college boys assurance piqued him
 After so many years he still keeps finding
 Good arguments he sees he might have used
 I sympathise I know just how it feels
 To think of the right thing to say too late
 Harolds associated in his mind with Latin
 He asked me what I thought of Harolds saying
 He studied Latin like the violin
 Because he liked itthat an argument
 He said he couldnt make the boy believe
 He could find water with a hazel prong
 Which showed how much good school had ever done him
 He wanted to go over that But most of all
 He thinks if he could have another chance
 To teach him how to build a load of hay
 I know thats Silas one accomplishment
 He bundles every forkful in its place
 And tags and numbers it for future reference
 So he can find and easily dislodge it
 In the unloading Silas does that well
 He takes it out in bunches like big birds nests
 You never see him standing on the hay
 Hes trying to lift straining to lift himself
 He thinks if he could teach him that hed be
 Some good perhaps to someone in the world
 He hates to see a boy the fool of books
 Poor Silas so concerned for other folk
 And nothing to look backward to with pride
 And nothing to look forward to with hope
 So now and never any different
 Part of a moon was falling down the west
 Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills
 Its light poured softly in her lap She saw
 And spread her apron to it She put out her hand
 Among the harplike morningglory strings
 Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves
 As if she played unheard the tenderness
 That wrought on him beside her in the night
 Warren she said he has come home to die
 You neednt be afraid hell leave you this time
 Home he mocked gently
 Yes what else but home
 It all depends on what you mean by home
 Of course hes nothing to us any more
 Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
 Out of the woods worn out upon the trail
 Home is the place where when you have to go there
 They have to take you in
 I should have called it
 Something you somehow havent to deserve
 Warren leaned out and took a step or two
 Picked up a little stick and brought it back
 And broke it in his hand and tossed it by
 Silas has better claim on us you think
 Than on his brother Thirteen little miles
 As the road winds would bring him to his door
 Silas has walked that far no doubt today
 Why didnt he go there His brothers rich
 A somebodydirector in the bank
 He never told us that
 We know it though
 I think his brother ought to help of course
 Ill see to that if there is need He ought of right
 To take him in and might be willing to
 He may be better than appearances
 But have some pity on Silas Do you think
 If hed had any pride in claiming kin
 Or anything he looked for from his brother
 Hed keep so still about him all this time
 I wonder whats between them
 I can tell you
 Silas is what he iswe wouldnt mind him
 But just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide
 He never did a thing so very bad
 He dont know why he isnt quite as good
 As anyone He wont be made ashamed
 To please his brother worthless though he is
 I cant think Si ever hurt anyone
 No but he hurt my heart the way he lay
 And rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback
 He wouldnt let me put him on the lounge
 You must go in and see what you can do
 I made the bed up for him there tonight
 Youll be surprised at himhow much hes broken
 His working days are done Im sure of it
 Id not be in a hurry to say that
 I havent been Go look see for yourself
 But Warren please remember how it is
 Hes come to help you ditch the meadow
 He has a plan You mustnt laugh at him
 He may not speak of it and then he may
 Ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud
 Will hit or miss the moon
 It hit the moon
 Then there were three there making a dim row
 The moon the little silver cloud and she
 Warren returnedtoo soon it seemed to her
 Slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited
 Warren she questioned
 Dead was all he answered




The Mountain

 THE mountain held the town as in a shadow
 I saw so much before I slept there once
 I noticed that I missed stars in the west
 Where its black body cut into the sky
 Near me it seemed I felt it like a wall
 Behind which I was sheltered from a wind
 And yet between the town and it I found
 When I walked forth at dawn to see new things
 Were fields a river and beyond more fields
 The river at the time was fallen away
 And made a widespread brawl on cobblestones
 But the signs showed what it had done in spring
 Good grassland gullied out and in the grass
 Ridges of sand and driftwood stripped of bark
 I crossed the river and swung round the mountain
 And there I met a man who moved so slow
 With whitefaced oxen in a heavy cart
 It seemed no hand to stop him altogether
 What town is this I asked
 This Lunenburg
 Then I was wrong the town of my sojourn
 Beyond the bridge was not that of the mountain
 But only felt at night its shadowy presence
 Where is your village Very far from here
 There is no villageonly scattered farms
 We were but sixty voters last election
 We cant in nature grow to many more
 That thing takes all the room He moved his goad
 The mountain stood there to be pointed at
 Pasture ran up the side a little way
 And then there was a wall of trees with trunks
 After that only tops of trees and cliffs
 Imperfectly concealed among the leaves
 A dry ravine emerged from under boughs
 Into the pasture
 That looks like a path
 Is that the way to reach the top from here
 Not for this morning but some other time
 I must be getting back to breakfast now
 I dont advise your trying from this side
 There is no proper path but those that have
 Been up I understand have climbed from Ladds
 Thats five miles back You cant mistake the place
 They logged it there last winter some way up
 Id take you but Im bound the other way
 Youve never climbed it
 Ive been on the sides
 Deerhunting and troutfishing Theres a brook
 That starts up on it somewhereIve heard say
 Right on the top tiptopa curious thing
 But what would interest you about the brook
 Its always cold in summer warm in winter
 One of the great sights going is to see
 It steam in winter like an oxs breath
 Until the bushes all along its banks
 Are inchdeep with the frosty spines and bristles
 You know the kind Then let the sun shine on it
 There ought to be a view around the world
 From such a mountainif it isnt wooded
 Clear to the top I saw through leafy screens
 Great granite terraces in sun and shadow
 Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up
 With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet
 Or turn and sit on and look out and down
 With little ferns in crevices at his elbow
 As to that I cant say But theres the spring
 Right on the summit almost like a fountain
 That ought to be worth seeing
 If its there
 You never saw it
 I guess theres no doubt
 About its being there I never saw it
 It may not be right on the very top
 It wouldnt have to be a long way down
 To have some head of water from above
 And a good distance down might not be noticed
 By anyone whod come a long way up
 One time I asked a fellow climbing it
 To look and tell me later how it was
 What did he say
 He said there was a lake
 Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top
 But a lakes different What about the spring
 He never got up high enough to see
 Thats why I dont advise your trying this side
 He tried this side Ive always meant to go
 And look myself but you know how it is
 It doesnt seem so much to climb a mountain
 Youve worked around the foot of all your life
 What would I do Go in my overalls
 With a big stick the same as when the cows
 Havent come down to the bars at milking time
 Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear
 Twouldnt seem real to climb for climbing it
 I shouldnt climb it if I didnt want to
 Not for the sake of climbing Whats its name
 We call it Hor I dont know if thats right
 Can one walk around it Would it be too far
 You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg
 But its as much as ever you can do
 The boundary lines keep in so close to it
 Hor is the township and the townships Hor
 And a few houses sprinkled round the foot
 Like boulders broken off the upper cliff
 Rolled out a little farther than the rest
 Warm in December cold in June you say
 I dont suppose the waters changed at all
 You and I know enough to know its warm
 Compared with cold and cold compared with warm
 But all the funs in how you say a thing
 Youve lived here all your life
 Ever since Hor
 Was no bigger than a What I did not hear
 He drew the oxen toward him with light touches
 Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank
 Gave them their marching orders and was moving




A Hundred Collars

 LANCASTER bore himsuch a little town
 Such a great man It doesnt see him often
 Of late years though he keeps the old homestead
 And sends the children down there with their mother
 To run wild in the summera little wild
 Sometimes he joins them for a day or two
 And sees old friends he somehow cant get near
 They meet him in the general store at night
 Preoccupied with formidable mail
 Rifling a printed letter as he talks
 They seem afraid He wouldnt have it so
 Though a great scholar hes a democrat
 If not at heart at least on principle
 Lately when coming up to Lancaster
 His train being late he missed another train
 And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction
 After eleven oclock at night Too tired
 To think of sitting such an ordeal out
 He turned to the hotel to find a bed
 No room the night clerk said Unless
 Woodsvilles a place of shrieks and wandering lamps
 And cars that shook and rattleand one hotel
 You say unless
 Unless you wouldnt mind
 Sharing a room with someone else
 Who is it
 A man
 So I should hope What kind of man
 I know him hes all right A mans a man
 Separate beds of course you understand
 The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on
 Whos that man sleeping in the office chair
 Has he had the refusal of my chance
 He was afraid of being robbed or murdered
 What do you say
 Ill have to have a bed
 The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs
 And down a narrow passage full of doors
 At the last one of which he knocked and entered
 Lafe heres a fellow wants to share your room
 Show him this way Im not afraid of him
 Im not so drunk I cant take care of myself
 The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot
 This will be yours Goodnight he said and went
 Lafe was the name I think
 Yes Layfayette
 You got it the first time And yours
 Magoon
 Doctor Magoon
 A Doctor
 Well a teacher
 Professor Squarethecircletillyouretired
 Hold on theres something I dont think of now
 That I had on my mind to ask the first
 Man that knew anything I happened in with
 Ill ask you laterdont let me forget it
 The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away
 A man A brute Naked above the waist
 He sat there creased and shining in the light
 Fumbling the buttons in a wellstarched shirt
 Im moving into a sizelarger shirt
 Ive felt mean lately means no name for it
 I just found what the matter was tonight
 Ive been achoking like a nursery tree
 When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag
 I blamed it on the hot spell weve been having
 Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back
 Not liking to own up Id grown a size
 Number eighteen this is What size do you wear
 The Doctor caught his throat convulsively
 Ohahfourteenfourteen
 Fourteen You say so
 I can remember when I wore fourteen
 And come to think I must have back at home
 More than a hundred collars size fourteen
 Too bad to waste them all You ought to have them
 Theyre yours and welcome let me send them to you
 What makes you stand there on one leg like that
 Youre not much furtherer than where Kike left you
 You act as if you wished you hadnt come
 Sit down or lie down friend you make me nervous
 The Doctor made a subdued dash for it
 And propped himself at bay against a pillow
 Not that way with your shoes on Kikes white bed
 You cant rest that way Let me pull your shoes off
 Dont touch me pleaseI say dont touch me please
 Ill not be put to bed by you my man
 Just as you say Have it your own way then
 My man is it You talk like a professor
 Speaking of whos afraid of who however
 Im thinking I have more to lose than you
 If anything should happen to be wrong
 Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat
 Lets have a show down as an evidence
 Of good faith There is ninety dollars
 Come if youre not afraid
 Im not afraid
 Theres five thats all I carry
 I can search you
 Where are you moving over to Stay still
 Youd better tuck your money under you
 And sleep on it the way I always do
 When Im with people I dont trust at night
 Will you believe me if I put it there
 Right on the counterpanethat I do trust you
 Youd say so Mister ManIm a collector
 My ninety isnt mineyou wont think that
 I pick it up a dollar at a time
 All round the country for the Weekly News
 Published in Bow You know the Weekly News
 Known it since I was young
 Then you know me
 Now we are getting on togethertalking
 Im sort of Something for it at the front
 My business is to find what people want
 They pay for it and so they ought to have it
 Fairbanks he says to mehes editor
 Feel out the public sentimenthe says
 A good deal comes on me when all is said
 The only trouble is we disagree
 In politics Im Vermont Democrat
 You know what that is sort of doubledyed
 The News has always been Republican
 Fairbanks he says to me Help us this year
 Meaning by us their ticket No I says
 I cant and wont Youve been in long enough
 Its time you turned around and boosted us
 Youll have to pay me more than ten a week
 If Im expected to elect Bill Taft
 I doubt if I could do it anyway
 You seem to shape the papers policy
 You see Im in with everybody know em all
 I almost know their farms as well as they do
 You drive around It must be pleasant work
 Its business but I cant say its not fun
 What I like bests the lay of different farms
 Coming out on them from a stretch of woods
 Or over a hill or round a sudden corner
 I like to find folks getting out in spring
 Raking the dooryard working near the house
 Later they get out further in the fields
 Everythings shut sometimes except the barn
 The familys all away in some back meadow
 Theres a hay load acomingwhen it comes
 And later still they all get driven in
 The fields are stripped to lawn the garden patches
 Stripped to bare ground the apple trees
 To whips and poles Theres nobody about
 The chimney though keeps up a good brisk smoking
 And I lie back and ride I take the reins
 Only when someones coming and the mare
 Stops when she likes I tell her when to go
 Ive spoiled Jemima in more ways than one
 Shes got so she turns in at every house
 As if she had some sort of curvature
 No matter if I have no errand there
 She thinks Im sociable I maybe am
 Its seldom I get down except for meals though
 Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep
 All in a family row down to the youngest
 One would suppose they might not be as glad
 To see you as you are to see them
 Oh
 Because I want their dollar I dont want
 Anything theyve not got I never dun
 Im there and they can pay me if they like
 I go nowhere on purpose I happen by
 Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink
 I drink out of the bottlenot your style
 Maynt I offer you
 No no no thank you
 Just as you say Heres looking at you then
 And now Im leaving you a little while
 Youll rest easier when Im gone perhaps
 Lie downlet yourself go and get some sleep
 But firstlets seewhat was I going to ask you
 Those collarswho shall I address them to
 Suppose you arent awake when I come back
 Really friend I cant let you Youmay need them
 Not till I shrink when theyll be out of style
 But really II have so many collars
 I dont know who I rather would have have them
 Theyre only turning yellow where they are
 But youre the doctor as the saying is
 Ill put the light out Dont you wait for me
 Ive just begun the night You get some sleep
 Ill knock sofashion and peep round the door
 When I come back so youll know who it is
 Theres nothing Im afraid of like scared people
 I dont want you should shoot me in the head
 What am I doing carrying off this bottle
 There now you get some sleep
 He shut the door
 The Doctor slid a little down the pillow




Home Burial

 HE saw her from the bottom of the stairs
 Before she saw him She was starting down
 Looking back over her shoulder at some fear
 She took a doubtful step and then undid it
 To raise herself and look again He spoke
 Advancing toward her What is it you see
 From up there alwaysfor I want to know
 She turned and sank upon her skirts at that
 And her face changed from terrified to dull
 He said to gain time What is it you see
 Mounting until she cowered under him
 I will find out nowyou must tell me dear
 She in her place refused him any help
 With the least stiffening of her neck and silence
 She let him look sure that he wouldnt see
 Blind creature and a while he didnt see
 But at last he murmured Oh and again Oh
 What is itwhat she said
 Just that I see
 You dont she challenged Tell me what it is
 The wonder is I didnt see at once
 I never noticed it from here before
 I must be wonted to itthats the reason
 The little graveyard where my people are
 So small the window frames the whole of it
 Not so much larger than a bedroom is it
 There are three stones of slate and one of marble
 Broadshouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
 On the sidehill We havent to mind those
 But I understand it is not the stones
 But the childs mound
 Dont dont dont dont she cried
 She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
 That rested on the banister and slid downstairs
 And turned on him with such a daunting look
 He said twice over before he knew himself
 Cant a man speak of his own child hes lost
 Not you Oh wheres my hat Oh I dont need it
 I must get out of here I must get air
 I dont know rightly whether any man can
 Amy Dont go to someone else this time
 Listen to me I wont come down the stairs
 He sat and fixed his chin between his fists
 Theres something I should like to ask you dear
 You dont know how to ask it
 Help me then
 Her fingers moved the latch for all reply
 My words are nearly always an offence
 I dont know how to speak of anything
 So as to please you But I might be taught
 I should suppose I cant say I see how
 A man must partly give up being a man
 With womenfolk We could have some arrangement
 By which Id bind myself to keep hands off
 Anything special youre amind to name
 Though I dont like such things twixt those that love
 Two that dont love cant live together without them
 But two that do cant live together with them
 She moved the latch a little Dontdont go
 Dont carry it to someone else this time
 Tell me about it if its something human
 Let me into your grief Im not so much
 Unlike other folks as your standing there
 Apart would make me out Give me my chance
 I do think though you overdo it a little
 What was it brought you up to think it the thing
 To take your motherloss of a first child
 So inconsolablyin the face of love
 Youd think his memory might be satisfied
 There you go sneering now
 Im not Im not
 You make me angry Ill come down to you
 God what a woman And its come to this
 A man cant speak of his own child thats dead
 You cant because you dont know how
 If you had any feelings you that dug
 With your own handhow could youhis little grave
 I saw you from that very window there
 Making the gravel leap and leap in air
 Leap up like that like that and land so lightly
 And roll back down the mound beside the hole
 I thought Who is that man I didnt know you
 And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
 To look again and still your spade kept lifting
 Then you came in I heard your rumbling voice
 Out in the kitchen and I dont know why
 But I went near to see with my own eyes
 You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
 Of the fresh earth from your own babys grave
 And talk about your everyday concerns
 You had stood the spade up against the wall
 Outside there in the entry for I saw it
 I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed
 Im cursed God if I dont believe Im cursed
 I can repeat the very words you were saying
 Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
 Will rot the best birch fence a man can build
 Think of it talk like that at such a time
 What had how long it takes a birch to rot
 To do with what was in the darkened parlour
 You couldnt care The nearest friends can go
 With anyone to death comes so far short
 They might as well not try to go at all
 No from the time when one is sick to death
 One is alone and he dies more alone
 Friends make pretence of following to the grave
 But before one is in it their minds are turned
 And making the best of their way back to life
 And living people and things they understand
 But the worlds evil I wont have grief so
 If I can change it Oh I wont I wont
 There you have said it all and you feel better
 You wont go now Youre crying Close the door
 The hearts gone out of it why keep it up
 Amy Theres someone coming down the road
 Youoh you think the talk is all I must go
 Somewhere out of this house How can I make you
 Ifyoudo She was opening the door wider
 Where do you mean to go First tell me that
 Ill follow and bring you back by force I will




The Black Cottage

 WE chanced in passing by that afternoon
 To catch it in a sort of special picture
 Among tarbanded ancient cherry trees
 Set well back from the road in rank lodged grass
 The little cottage we were speaking of
 A front with just a door between two windows
 Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black
 We paused the minister and I to look
 He made as if to hold it at arms length
 Or put the leaves aside that framed it in
 Pretty he said Come in No one will care
 The path was a vague parting in the grass
 That led us to a weathered windowsill
 We pressed our faces to the pane You see he said
 Everythings as she left it when she died
 Her sons wont sell the house or the things in it
 They say they mean to come and summer here
 Where they were boys They havent come this year
 They live so far awayone is out west
 It will be hard for them to keep their word
 Anyway they wont have the place disturbed
 A buttoned haircloth lounge spread scrolling arms
 Under a crayon portrait on the wall
 Done sadly from an old daguerreotype
 That was the father as he went to war
 She always when she talked about war
 Sooner or later came and leaned half knelt
 Against the lounge beside it though I doubt
 If such unlifelike lines kept power to stir
 Anything in her after all the years
 He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg
 I ought to knowit makes a difference which
 Fredericksburg wasnt Gettysburg of course
 But what Im getting to is how forsaken
 A little cottage this has always seemed
 Since she went more than ever but before
 I dont mean altogether by the lives
 That had gone out of it the father first
 Then the two sons till she was left alone
 Nothing could draw her after those two sons
 She valued the considerate neglect
 She had at some cost taught them after years
 I mean by the worlds having passed it by
 As we almost got by this afternoon
 It always seems to me a sort of mark
 To measure how far fifty years have brought us
 Why not sit down if you are in no haste
 These doorsteps seldom have a visitor
 The warping boards pull out their own old nails
 With none to tread and put them in their place
 She had her own idea of things the old lady
 And she liked talk She had seen Garrison
 And Whittier and had her story of them
 One wasnt long in learning that she thought
 Whatever else the Civil War was for
 It wasnt just to keep the States together
 Nor just to free the slaves though it did both
 She wouldnt have believed those ends enough
 To have given outright for them all she gave
 Her giving somehow touched the principle
 That all men are created free and equal
 And to hear her quaint phrasesso removed
 From the worlds view today of all those things
 Thats a hard mystery of Jeffersons
 What did he mean Of course the easy way
 Is to decide it simply isnt true
 It may not be I heard a fellow say so
 But never mind the Welshman got it planted
 Where it will trouble us a thousand years
 Each age will have to reconsider it
 You couldnt tell her what the West was saying
 And what the South to her serene belief
 She had some art of hearing and yet not
 Hearing the latter wisdom of the world
 White was the only race she ever knew
 Black she had scarcely seen and yellow never
 But how could they be made so very unlike
 By the same hand working in the same stuff
 She had supposed the war decided that
 What are you going to do with such a person
 Strange how such innocence gets its own way
 I shouldnt be surprised if in this world
 It were the force that would at last prevail
 Do you know but for her there was a time
 When to please younger members of the church
 Or rather say nonmembers in the church
 Whom we all have to think of nowadays
 I would have changed the Creed a very little
 Not that she ever had to ask me not to
 It never got so far as that but the bare thought
 Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew
 And of her half asleep was too much for me
 Why I might wake her up and startle her
 It was the words descended into Hades
 That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth
 You know they suffered from a general onslaught
 And well if they werent true why keep right on
 Saying them like the heathen We could drop them
 Onlythere was the bonnet in the pew
 Such a phrase couldnt have meant much to her
 But suppose she had missed it from the Creed
 As a child misses the unsaid Goodnight
 And falls asleep with heartachehow should I feel
 Im just as glad she made me keep hands off
 For dear me why abandon a belief
 Merely because it ceases to be true
 Cling to it long enough and not a doubt
 It will turn true again for so it goes
 Most of the change we think we see in life
 Is due to truths being in and out of favour
 As I sit here and oftentimes I wish
 I could be monarch of a desert land
 I could devote and dedicate forever
 To the truths we keep coming back and back to
 So desert it would have to be so walled
 By mountain ranges half in summer snow
 No one would covet it or think it worth
 The pains of conquering to force change on
 Scattered oases where men dwelt but mostly
 Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk
 Blown over and over themselves in idleness
 Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew
 The babe born to the desert the sand storm
 Retard midwaste my cowering caravans
 There are bees in this wall He struck the clapboards
 Fierce heads looked out small bodies pivoted
 We rose to go Sunset blazed on the windows




Blueberries

 YOU ought to have seen what I saw on my way
 To the village through Mortensons pasture today
 Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb
 Real skyblue and heavy and ready to drum
 In the cavernous pail of the first one to come
 And all ripe together not some of them green
 And some of them ripe You ought to have seen
 I dont know what part of the pasture you mean
 You know where they cut off the woodslet me see
 It was two years agoor nocan it be
 No longer than thatand the following fall
 The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall
 Why there hasnt been time for the bushes to grow
 Thats always the way with the blueberries though
 There may not have been the ghost of a sign
 Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine
 But get the pine out of the way you may burn
 The pasture all over until not a fern
 Or grassblade is left not to mention a stick
 And presto theyre up all around you as thick
 And hard to explain as a conjurors trick
 It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit
 I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot
 And after all really theyre ebony skinned
 The blues but a mist from the breath of the wind
 A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand
 And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned
 Does Mortenson know what he has do you think
 He may and not care and so leave the chewink
 To gather them for himyou know what he is
 He wont make the fact that theyre rightfully his
 An excuse for keeping us other folk out
 I wonder you didnt see Loren about
 The best of it was that I did Do you know
 I was just getting through what the field had to show
 And over the wall and into the road
 When who should come by with a democratload
 Of all the young chattering Lorens alive
 But Loren the fatherly out for a drive
 He saw you then What did he do Did he frown
 He just kept nodding his head up and down
 You know how politely he always goes by
 But he thought a big thoughtI could tell by his eye
 Which being expressed might be this in effect
 I have left those there berries I shrewdly suspect
 To ripen too long I am greatly to blame
 Hes a thriftier person than some I could name
 He seems to be thrifty and hasnt he need
 With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed
 He has brought them all up on wild berries they say
 Like birds They store a great many away
 They eat them the year round and those they dont eat
 They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet
 Who cares what they say Its a nice way to live
 Just taking what Nature is willing to give
 Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow
 I wish you had seen his perpetual bow
 And the air of the youngsters Not one of them turned
 And they looked so solemnabsurdly concerned
 I wish I knew half what the flock of them know
 Of where all the berries and other things grow
 Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top
 Of the boulderstrewn mountain and when they will crop
 I met them one day and each had a flower
 Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower
 Some strange kindthey told me it hadnt a name
 Ive told you how once not long after we came
 I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth
 By going to him of all people on earth
 To ask if he knew any fruit to be had
 For the picking The rascal he said hed be glad
 To tell if he knew But the year had been bad
 There had been some berriesbut those were all gone
 He didnt say where they had been He went on
 Im sureIm sureas polite as could be
 He spoke to his wife in the door Let me see
 Mame we dont know any good berrying place
 It was all he could do to keep a straight face
 If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him
 Hell find hes mistaken See here for a whim
 Well pick in the Mortensons pasture this year
 Well go in the morning that is if its clear
 And the sun shines out warm the vines must be wet
 Its so long since I picked I almost forget
 How we used to pick berries we took one look round
 Then sank out of sight like trolls underground
 And saw nothing more of each other or heard
 Unless when you said I was keeping a bird
 Away from its nest and I said it was you
 Well one of us is For complaining it flew
 Around and around us And then for a while
 We picked till I feared you had wandered a mile
 And I thought I had lost you I lifted a shout
 Too loud for the distance you were it turned out
 For when you made answer your voice was as low
 As talkingyou stood up beside me you know
 We shant have the place to ourselves to enjoy
 Not likely when all the young Lorens deploy
 Theyll be there tomorrow or even tonight
 They wont be too friendlythey may be polite
 To people they look on as having no right
 To pick where theyre picking But we wont complain
 You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain
 The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves
 Like two kinds of jewels a vision for thieves




A Servant to Servants

 I DIDNT make you know how glad I was
 To have you come and camp here on our land
 I promised myself to get down some day
 And see the way you lived but I dont know
 With a houseful of hungry men to feed
 I guess youd find It seems to me
 I cant express my feelings any more
 Than I can raise my voice or want to lift
 My hand oh I can lift it when I have to
 Did ever you feel so I hope you never
 Its got so I dont even know for sure
 Whether I am glad sorry or anything
 Theres nothing but a voicelike left inside
 That seems to tell me how I ought to feel
 And would feel if I wasnt all gone wrong
 You take the lake I look and look at it
 I see its a fair pretty sheet of water
 I stand and make myself repeat out loud
 The advantages it has so long and narrow
 Like a deep piece of some old running river
 Cut short off at both ends It lies five miles
 Straight away through the mountain notch
 From the sink window where I wash the plates
 And all our storms come up toward the house
 Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter
 It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
 To step outdoors and take the water dazzle
 A sunny morning or take the rising wind
 About my face and body and through my wrapper
 When a storm threatened from the Dragons Den
 And a cold chill shivered across the lake
 I see its a fair pretty sheet of water
 Our Willoughby How did you hear of it
 I expect though everyones heard of it
 In a book about ferns Listen to that
 You let things more like feathers regulate
 Your going and coming And you like it here
 I can see how you might But I dont know
 It would be different if more people came
 For then there would be business As it is
 The cottages Len built sometimes we rent them
 Sometimes we dont Weve a good piece of shore
 That ought to be worth something and may yet
 But I dont count on it as much as Len
 He looks on the bright side of everything
 Including me He thinks Ill be all right
 With doctoring But its not medicine
 Lowe is the only doctors dared to say so
 Its rest I wantthere I have said it out
 From cooking meals for hungry hired men
 And washing dishes after themfrom doing
 Things over and over that just wont stay done
 By good rights I ought not to have so much
 Put on me but there seems no other way
 Len says one steady pull more ought to do it
 He says the best way out is always through
 And I agree to that or in so far
 As that I can see no way out but through
 Leastways for meand then theyll be convinced
 Its not that Len dont want the best for me
 It was his plan our moving over in
 Beside the lake from where that day I showed you
 We used to liveten miles from anywhere
 We didnt change without some sacrifice
 But Len went at it to make up the loss
 His works a mans of course from sun to sun
 But he works when he works as hard as I do
 Though theres small profit in comparisons
 Women and men will make them all the same
 But work aint all Len undertakes too much
 Hes into everything in town This year
 Its highways and hes got too many men
 Around him to look after that make waste
 They take advantage of him shamefully
 And proud too of themselves for doing so
 We have four here to board great goodfornothings
 Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
 While I fry their bacon Much they care
 No more put out in what they do or say
 Than if I wasnt in the room at all
 Coming and going all the time they are
 I dont learn what their names are let alone
 Their characters or whether they are safe
 To have inside the house with doors unlocked
 Im not afraid of them though if theyre not
 Afraid of me Theres two can play at that
 I have my fancies it runs in the family
 My fathers brother wasnt right They kept him
 Locked up for years back there at the old farm
 Ive been away onceyes Ive been away
 The State Asylum I was prejudiced
 I wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there
 You know the old ideathe only asylum
 Was the poorhouse and those who could afford
 Rather than send their folks to such a place
 Kept them at home and it does seem more human
 But its not so the place is the asylum
 There they have every means proper to do with
 And you arent darkening other peoples lives
 Worse than no good to them and they no good
 To you in your condition you cant know
 Affection or the want of it in that state
 Ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way
 My fathers brother he went mad quite young
 Some thought he had been bitten by a dog
 Because his violence took on the form
 Of carrying his pillow in his teeth
 But its more likely he was crossed in love
 Or so the story goes It was some girl
 Anyway all he talked about was love
 They soon saw he would do someone a mischief
 If he want kept strict watch of and it ended
 In fathers building him a sort of cage
 Or room within a room of hickory poles
 Like stanchions in the barn from floor to ceiling
 A narrow passage all the way around
 Anything they put in for furniture
 Hed tear to pieces even a bed to lie on
 So they made the place comfortable with straw
 Like a beasts stall to ease their consciences
 Of course they had to feed him without dishes
 They tried to keep him clothed but he paraded
 With his clothes on his armall of his clothes
 Cruelit sounds I spose they did the best
 They knew And just when he was at the height
 Father and mother married and mother came
 A bride to help take care of such a creature
 And accommodate her young life to his
 That was what marrying father meant to her
 She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
 By his shouts in the night Hed shout and shout
 Until the strength was shouted out of him
 And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion
 Hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring
 And let them go and make them twang until
 His hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow
 And then hed crow as if he thought that childs play
 The only fun he had Ive heard them say though
 They found a way to put a stop to it
 He was before my timeI never saw him
 But the pen stayed exactly as it was
 There in the upper chamber in the ell
 A sort of catchall full of attic clutter
 I often think of the smooth hickory bars
 It got so I would sayyou know half fooling
 Its time I took my turn upstairs in jail
 Just as you will till it becomes a habit
 No wonder I was glad to get away
 Mind you I waited till Len said the word
 I didnt want the blame if things went wrong
 I was glad though no end when we moved out
 And I looked to be happy and I was
 As I said for a whilebut I dont know
 Somehow the change wore out like a prescription
 And theres more to it than just windowviews
 And living by a lake Im past such help
 Unless Len took the notion which he wont
 And I wont ask himits not sure enough
 I spose Ive got to go the road Im going
 Other folks have to and why shouldnt I
 I almost think if I could do like you
 Drop everything and live out on the ground
 But it might be come night I shouldnt like it
 Or a long rain I should soon get enough
 And be glad of a good roof overhead
 Ive lain awake thinking of you Ill warrant
 More than you have yourself some of these nights
 The wonder was the tents werent snatched away
 From over you as you lay in your beds
 I havent courage for a risk like that
 Bless you of course youre keeping me from work
 But the thing of it is I need to be kept
 Theres work enough to dotheres always that
 But behinds behind The worst that you can do
 Is set me back a little more behind
 I shant catch up in this world anyway
 Id rather youd not go unless you must




After Applepicking

 MY long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree
 Toward heaven still
 And theres a barrel that I didnt fill
 Beside it and there may be two or three
 Apples I didnt pick upon some bough
 But I am done with applepicking now
 Essence of winter sleep is on the night
 The scent of apples I am drowsing off
 I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
 I got from looking through a pane of glass
 I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
 And held against the world of hoary grass
 It melted and I let it fall and break
 But I was well
 Upon my way to sleep before it fell
 And I could tell
 What form my dreaming was about to take
 Magnified apples appear and disappear
 Stem end and blossom end
 And every fleck of russet showing clear
 My instep arch not only keeps the ache
 It keeps the pressure of a ladderround
 I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend
 And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
 The rumbling sound
 Of load on load of apples coming in
 For I have had too much
 Of applepicking I am overtired
 Of the great harvest I myself desired
 There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch
 Cherish in hand lift down and not let fall
 For all
 That struck the earth
 No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble
 Went surely to the ciderapple heap
 As of no worth
 One can see what will trouble
 This sleep of mine whatever sleep it is
 Were he not gone
 The woodchuck could say whether its like his
 Long sleep as I describe its coming on
 Or just some human sleep




The Code

 THERE were three in the meadow by the brook
 Gathering up windrows piling cocks of hay
 With an eye always lifted toward the west
 Where an irregular sunbordered cloud
 Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger
 Flickering across its bosom Suddenly
 One helper thrusting pitchfork in the ground
 Marched himself off the field and home One stayed
 The townbred farmer failed to understand
 What is there wrong
 Something you just now said
 What did I say
 About our taking pains
 To cock the haybecause its going to shower
 I said that more than half an hour ago
 I said it to myself as much as you
 You didnt know But James is one big fool
 He thought you meant to find fault with his work
 Thats what the average farmer would have meant
 James would take time of course to chew it over
 Before he acted hes just got round to act
 He is a fool if thats the way he takes me
 Dont let it bother you Youve found out something
 The hand that knows his business wont be told
 To do work better or fasterthose two things
 Im as particular as anyone
 Most likely Id have served you just the same
 But I know you dont understand our ways
 You were just talking what was in your mind
 What was in all our minds and you werent hinting
 Tell you a story of what happened once
 I was up here in Salem at a mans
 Named Sanders with a gang of four or five
 Doing the haying No one liked the boss
 He was one of the kind sports call a spider
 All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
 From a humped body nigh as bigs a biscuit
 But work that man could work especially
 If by so doing he could get more work
 Out of his hired help Im not denying
 He was hard on himself I couldnt find
 That he kept any hoursnot for himself
 Daylight and lanternlight were one to him
 Ive heard him pounding in the barn all night
 But what he liked was someone to encourage
 Them that he couldnt lead hed get behind
 And drive the way you can you know in mowing
 Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off
 Id seen about enough of his bulling tricks
 We call that bulling Id been watching him
 So when he paired off with me in the hayfield
 To load the load thinks I Look out for trouble
 I built the load and topped it off old Sanders
 Combed it down with a rake and says O K
 Everything went well till we reached the barn
 With a big catch to empty in a bay
 You understand that meant the easy job
 For the man up on top of throwing down
 The hay and rolling it off wholesale
 Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting
 You wouldnt think a fellowd need much urging
 Under these circumstances would you now
 But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands
 And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit
 Shouts like an army captain Let her come
 Thinks I Dye mean it What was that you said
 I asked out loud sos thered be no mistake
 Did you say Let her come Yes let her come
 He said it over but he said it softer
 Never you say a thing like that to a man
 Not if he values what he is God Id as soon
 Murdered him as left out his middle name
 Id built the load and knew right where to find it
 Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for
 Like meditating and then I just dug in
 And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots
 I looked over the side once in the dust
 And caught sight of him treadingwaterlike
 Keeping his head above Damn ye I says
 That gets ye He squeaked like a squeezed rat
 That was the last I saw or heard of him
 I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off
 As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck
 And sort of waiting to be asked about it
 One of the boys sings out Wheres the old man
 I left him in the barn under the hay
 If ye want him ye can go and dig him out
 They realized from the way I swobbed my neck
 More than was needed something must be up
 They headed for the barn I stayed where I was
 They told me afterward First they forked hay
 A lot of it out into the barn floor
 Nothing They listened for him Not a rustle
 I guess they thought Id spiked him in the temple
 Before I buried him or I couldnt have managed
 They excavated more Go keep his wife
 Out of the barn Someone looked in a window
 And curse me if he wasnt in the kitchen
 Slumped way down in a chair with both his feet
 Stuck in the oven the hottest day that summer
 He looked so clean disgusted from behind
 There was no one that dared to stir him up
 Or let him know that he was being looked at
 Apparently I hadnt buried him
 I may have knocked him down but my just trying
 To bury him had hurt his dignity
 He had gone to the house sos not to meet me
 He kept away from us all afternoon
 We tended to his hay We saw him out
 After a while picking peas in his garden
 He couldnt keep away from doing something
 Werent you relieved to find he wasnt dead
 No and yet I dont knowits hard to say
 I went about to kill him fair enough
 You took an awkward way Did he discharge you
 Discharge me No He knew I did just right




The Generations of Men

 A GOVERNOR it was proclaimed this time
 When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire
 Ancestral memories might come together
 And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow
 A rockstrewn town where farming has fallen off
 And sproutlands flourish where the axe has gone
 Someone had literally run to earth
 In an old cellar hole in a byroad
 The origin of all the family there
 Thence they were sprung so numerous a tribe
 That now not all the houses left in town
 Made shift to shelter them without the help
 Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard
 They were at Bow but that was not enough
 Nothing would do but they must fix a day
 To stand together on the craters verge
 That turned them on the world and try to fathom
 The past and get some strangeness out of it
 But rain spoiled all The day began uncertain
 With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted
 The young folk held some hope out to each other
 Till well toward noon when the storm settled down
 With a swish in the grass What if the others
 Are there they said It isnt going to rain
 Only one from a farm not far away
 Strolled thither not expecting he would find
 Anyone else but out of idleness
 One and one other yes for there were two
 The second round the curving hillside road
 Was a girl and she halted some way off
 To reconnoitre and then made up her mind
 At least to pass by and see who he was
 And perhaps hear some word about the weather
 This was some Stark she didnt know He nodded
 No fete today he said
 It looks that way
 She swept the heavens turning on her heel
 I only idled down
 I idled down
 Provision there had been for just such meeting
 Of stranger cousins in a family tree
 Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch
 Of the one bearing it done in detail
 Some zealous ones laborious device
 She made a sudden movement toward her bodice
 As one who clasps her heart They laughed together
 Stark he inquired No matter for the proof
 Yes Stark And you
 Im Stark He drew his passport
 You know we might not be and still be cousins
 The town is full of Chases Lowes and Baileys
 All claiming some priority in Starkness
 My mother was a Lane yet might have married
 Anyone upon earth and still her children
 Would have been Starks and doubtless here today
 You riddle with your genealogy
 Like a Viola I dont follow you
 I only mean my mother was a Stark
 Several times over and by marrying father
 No more than brought us back into the name
 One ought not to be thrown into confusion
 By a plain statement of relationship
 But I own what you say makes my head spin
 You take my cardyou seem so good at such things
 And see if you can reckon our cousinship
 Why not take seats here on the cellar wall
 And dangle feet among the raspberry vines
 Under the shelter of the family tree
 Just sothat ought to be enough protection
 Not from the rain I think its going to rain
 Its raining
 No its misting lets be fair
 Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes
 The situation was like this the road
 Bowed outward on the mountain halfway up
 And disappeared and ended not far off
 No one went home that way The only house
 Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod
 And below roared a brook hidden in trees
 The sound of which was silence for the place
 This he sat listening to till she gave judgment
 On fathers side it seems werelet me see
 Dont be too technicalYou have three cards
 Four cards one yours three mine one for each branch
 Of the Stark family Im a member of
 Dyou know a person so related to herself
 Is supposed to be mad
 I may be mad
 You look so sitting out here in the rain
 Studying genealogy with me
 You never saw before What will we come to
 With all this pride of ancestry we Yankees
 I think were all mad Tell me why were here
 Drawn into town about this cellar hole
 Like wild geese on a lake before a storm
 What do we see in such a hole I wonder
 The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc
 Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of
 This is the pit from which we Starks were digged
 You must be learned Thats what you see in it
 And what do you see
 Yes what do I see
 First let me look I see raspberry vines
 Oh if youre going to use your eyes just hear
 What I see Its a little little boy
 As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun
 Hes groping in the cellar after jam
 He thinks its dark and its flooded with daylight
 Hes nothing Listen When I lean like this
 I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly
 With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug
 Bless you it isnt Grandsir Stark its Granny
 But the pipes there and smoking and the jug
 Shes after cider the old girl shes thirsty
 Heres hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely
 Tell me about her Does she look like me
 She should shouldnt she youre so many times
 Over descended from her I believe
 She does look like you Stay the way you are
 The nose is just the same and sos the chin
 Making allowance making due allowance
 You poor dear great great great great Granny
 See that you get her greatness right Dont stint her
 Yes its important though you think it isnt
 I wont be teased But see how wet I am
 Yes you must go we cant stay here for ever
 But wait until I give you a hand up
 A bead of silver water more or less
 Strung on your hair wont hurt your summer looks
 I wanted to try something with the noise
 That the brook raises in the empty valley
 We have seen visionsnow consult the voices
 Something I must have learned riding in trains
 When I was young I used the roar
 To set the voices speaking out of it
 Speaking or singing and the bandmusic playing
 Perhaps you have the art of what I mean
 Ive never listened in among the sounds
 That a brook makes in such a wild descent
 It ought to give a purer oracle
 Its as you throw a picture on a screen
 The meaning of it all is out of you
 The voices give you what you wish to hear
 Strangely its anything they wish to give
 Then I dont know It must be strange enough
 I wonder if its not your makebelieve
 What do you think youre like to hear today
 From the sense of our having been together
 But why take time for what Im like to hear
 Ill tell you what the voices really say
 You will do very well right where you are
 A little longer I mustnt feel too hurried
 Or I cant give myself to hear the voices
 Is this some trance you are withdrawing into
 You must be very still you mustnt talk
 Ill hardly breathe
 The voices seem to say
 Im waiting
 Dont The voices seem to say
 Call her Nausicaa the unafraid
 Of an acquaintance made adventurously
 I let you say thaton consideration
 I dont see very well how you can help it
 You want the truth I speak but by the voices
 You see they know I havent had your name
 Though what a name should matter between us
 I shall suspect
 Be good The voices say
 Call her Nausicaa and take a timber
 That you shall find lies in the cellar charred
 Among the raspberries and hew and shape it
 For a doorsill or other corner piece
 In a new cottage on the ancient spot
 The life is not yet all gone out of it
 And come and make your summer dwelling here
 And perhaps she will come still unafraid
 And sit before you in the open door
 With flowers in her lap until they fade
 But not come in across the sacred sill
 I wonder where your oracle is tending
 You can see that theres something wrong with it
 Or it would speak in dialect Whose voice
 Does it purport to speak in Not old Grandsirs
 Nor Grannys surely Call up one of them
 They have best right to be heard in this place
 You seem so partial to our greatgrandmother
 Nine times removed Correct me if I err
 You will be likely to regard as sacred
 Anything she may say But let me warn you
 Folks in her day were given to plain speaking
 You think youd best tempt her at such a time
 It rests with us always to cut her off
 Well then its Granny speaking I dunnow
 Mebbe Im wrong to take it as I do
 There aint no names quite like the old ones though
 Nor never will be to my way of thinking
 One mustnt bear too hard on the new comers
 But theres a dite too many of them for comfort
 I should feel easier if I could see
 More of the salt wherewith theyre to be salted
 Son you do as youre told You take the timber
 Its as sound as the day when it was cut
 And begin over There shed better stop
 You can see what is troubling Granny though
 But dont you think we sometimes make too much
 Of the old stock What counts is the ideals
 And those will bear some keeping still about
 I can see we are going to be good friends
 I like your going to be You said just now
 Its going to rain
 I know and it was raining
 I let you say all that But I must go now
 You let me say it on consideration
 How shall we say goodbye in such a case
 How shall we
 Will you leave the way to me
 No I dont trust your eyes Youve said enough
 Now give me your hand upPick me that flower
 Where shall we meet again
 Nowhere but here
 Once more before we meet elsewhere
 In rain
 It ought to be in rain Sometime in rain
 In rain tomorrow shall we if it rains
 But if we must in sunshine So she went




The Housekeeper

 I LET myself in at the kitchen door
 Its you she said I cant get up Forgive me
 Not answering your knock I can no more
 Let people in than I can keep them out
 Im getting too old for my size I tell them
 My fingers are about all Ive the use of
 Sos to take any comfort I can sew
 I help out with this beadwork what I can
 Thats a smart pair of pumps youre beading there
 Who are they for
 You meanoh for some miss
 I cant keep track of other peoples daughters
 Lord if I were to dream of everyone
 Whose shoes I primped to dance in
 And wheres John
 Havent you seen him Strange what set you off
 To come to his house when hes gone to yours
 You cant have passed each other I know what
 He must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands
 He wont be long in that case You can wait
 Though what good you can be or anyone
 Its gone so far Youve heard Estelles run off
 Yes whats it all about When did she go
 Two weeks since
 Shes in earnest it appears
 Im sure she wont come back Shes hiding somewhere
 I dont know where myself John thinks I do
 He thinks I only have to say the word
 And shell come back But bless you Im her mother
 I cant talk to her and Lord if I could
 It will go hard with John What will he do
 He cant find anyone to take her place
 Oh if you ask me that what will he do
 He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together
 With me to sit and tell him everything
 Whats wanted and how much and where it is
 But when Im goneof course I cant stay here
 Estelles to take me when shes settled down
 He and I only hinder one another
 I tell them they cant get me through the door though
 Ive been built in here like a big church organ
 Weve been here fifteen years
 Thats a long time
 To live together and then pull apart
 How do you see him living when youre gone
 Two of you out will leave an empty house
 I dont just see him living many years
 Left here with nothing but the furniture
 I hate to think of the old place when were gone
 With the brook going by below the yard
 And no one here but hens blowing about
 If he could sell the place but then he cant
 No one will ever live on it again
 Its too run down This is the last of it
 What I think he will do is let things smash
 Hell sort of swear the time away Hes awful
 I never saw a man let family troubles
 Make so much difference in his mans affairs
 Hes just dropped everything Hes like a child
 I blame his being brought up by his mother
 Hes got hay down thats been rained on three times
 He hoed a little yesterday for me
 I thought the growing things would do him good
 Something went wrong I saw him throw the hoe
 Skyhigh with both hands I can see it now
 Come hereIll show youin that apple tree
 Thats no way for a man to do at his age
 Hes fiftyfive you know if hes a day
 Arent you afraid of him Whats that gun for
 Oh thats been there for hawks since chickentime
 John Hall touch me Not if he knows his friends
 Ill say that for him Johns no threatener
 Like some men folk No ones afraid of him
 All is hes made up his mind not to stand
 What he has got to stand
 Where is Estelle
 Couldnt one talk to her What does she say
 You say you dont know where she is
 Nor want to
 She thinks if it was bad to live with him
 It must be right to leave him
 Which is wrong
 Yes but he should have married her
 I know
 The strains been too much for her all these years
 I cant explain it any other way
 Its different with a man at least with John
 He knows hes kinder than the run of men
 Better than married ought to be as good
 As marriedthats what he has always said
 I know the way hes feltbut all the same
 I wonder why he doesnt marry her
 And end it
 Too late now she wouldnt have him
 Hes given her time to think of something else
 Thats his mistake The dear knows my interest
 Has been to keep the thing from breaking up
 This is a good home I dont ask for better
 But when Ive said Why shouldnt they be married
 Hed say Why should they no more words than that
 And after all why should they Johns been fair
 I take it What was his was always hers
 There was no quarrel about property
 Reason enough there was no property
 A friend or two as good as own the farm
 Such as it is It isnt worth the mortgage
 I mean Estelle has always held the purse
 The rights of that are harder to get at
 I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse
 Twas we let him have money not he us
 Johns a bad farmer Im not blaming him
 Take it year in year out he doesnt make much
 We came here for a home for me you know
 Estelle to do the housework for the board
 Of both of us But look how it turns out
 She seems to have the housework and besides
 Half of the outdoor work though as for that
 Hed say she does it more because she likes it
 You see our pretty things are all outdoors
 Our hens and cows and pigs are always better
 Than folks like us have any business with
 Farmers around twice as well off as we
 Havent as good They dont go with the farm
 One thing you cant help liking about John
 Hes fond of nice thingstoo fond some would say
 But Estelle dont complain shes like him there
 She wants our hens to be the best there are
 You never saw this room before a show
 Full of lank shivery halfdrowned birds
 In separate coops having their plumage done
 The smell of the wet feathers in the heat
 You spoke of Johns not being safe to stay with
 You dont know what a gentle lot we are
 We wouldnt hurt a hen You ought to see us
 Moving a flock of hens from place to place
 Were not allowed to take them upside down
 All we can hold together by the legs
 Two at a times the rule one on each arm
 No matter how far and how many times
 We have to go
 You mean thats Johns idea
 And we live up to it or I dont know
 What childishness he wouldnt give way to
 He manages to keep the upper hand
 On his own farm Hes boss But as to hens
 We fence our flowers in and the hens range
 Nothings too good for them We say it pays
 John likes to tell the offers he has had
 Twenty for this cock twentyfive for that
 He never takes the money If theyre worth
 That much to sell theyre worth as much to keep
 Bless you its all expense though Reach me down
 The little tin box on the cupboard shelf
 The upper shelf the tin box Thats the one
 Ill show you Here you are
 Whats this
 A bill
 For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock
 Receipted And the cock is in the yard
 Not in a glass case then
 Hed need a tall one
 He can eat off a barrel from the ground
 Hes been in a glass case as you may say
 The Crystal Palace London Hes imported
 John bought him and we paid the bill with beads
 Wampum I call it Mind we dont complain
 But you see dont you we take care of him
 And like it too It makes it all the worse
 It seems as if And thats not all hes helpless
 In ways that I can hardly tell you of
 Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts
 To see where all the money goes so fast
 You know how men will be ridiculous
 But its just fun the way he gets bedeviled
 If hes untidy now what will he be
 It makes it all the worse You must be blind
 Estelles the one You neednt talk to me
 Cant you and I get to the root of it
 Whats the real trouble What will satisfy her
 Its as I say shes turned from him thats all
 But why when shes well off Is it the neighbours
 Being cut off from friends
 We have our friends
 That isnt it Folks arent afraid of us
 Shes let it worry her You stood the strain
 And youre her mother
 But I didnt always
 I didnt relish it along at first
 But I got wonted to it And besides
 John said I was too old to have grandchildren
 But whats the use of talking when its done
 She wont come backits worse than thatshe cant
 Why do you speak like that What do you know
 What do you meanshes done harm to herself
 I mean shes marriedmarried someone else
 Oho oho
 You dont believe me
 Yes I do
 Only too well I knew there must be something
 So that was what was back Shes bad thats all
 Bad to get married when she had the chance
 Nonsense See whats she done But who who
 Whod marry her straight out of such a mess
 Say it right outno matter for her mother
 The man was found Id better name no names
 John himself wont imagine who he is
 Then its all up I think Ill get away
 Youll be expecting John I pity Estelle
 I suppose she deserves some pity too
 You ought to have the kitchen to yourself
 To break it to him You may have the job
 You neednt think youre going to get away
 Johns almost here Ive had my eye on someone
 Coming down Ryans Hill I thought twas him
 Here he is now This box Put it away
 And this bill
 Whats the hurry Hell unhitch
 No he wont either Hell just drop the reins
 And turn Doll out to pasture rig and all
 She wont get far before the wheels hang up
 On somethingtheres no harm See there he is
 My but he looks as if he must have heard
 John threw the door wide but he didnt enter
 How are you neighbour Just the man Im after
 Isnt it Hell he said I want to know
 Come out here if you want to hear me talk
 Ill talk to you old woman afterward
 Ive got some news that maybe isnt news
 What are they trying to do to me these two
 Do go along with him and stop his shouting
 She raised her voice against the closing door
 Who wants to hear your news youdreadful fool




The Fear

 A LANTERN light from deeper in the barn
 Shone on a man and woman in the door
 And threw their lurching shadows on a house
 Near by all dark in every glossy window
 A horses hoof pawed once the hollow floor
 And the back of the gig they stood beside
 Moved in a little The man grasped a wheel
 The woman spoke out sharply Whoa stand still
 I saw it just as plain as a white plate
 She said as the light on the dashboard ran
 Along the bushes at the roadsidea mans face
 You must have seen it too
 I didnt see it
 Are you sure
 Yes Im sure
 it was a face
 Joel Ill have to look I cant go in
 I cant and leave a thing like that unsettled
 Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference
 I always have felt strange when we came home
 To the dark house after so long an absence
 And the key rattled loudly into place
 Seemed to warn someone to be getting out
 At one door as we entered at another
 What if Im right and someone all the time
 Dont hold my arm
 I say its someone passing
 You speak as if this were a travelled road
 You forget where we are What is beyond
 That hed be going to or coming from
 At such an hour of night and on foot too
 What was he standing still for in the bushes
 Its not so very lateits only dark
 Theres more in it than youre inclined to say
 Did he look like
 He looked like anyone
 Ill never rest tonight unless I know
 Give me the lantern
 You dont want the lantern
 She pushed past him and got it for herself
 Youre not to come she said This is my business
 If the times come to face it Im the one
 To put it the right way Hed never dare
 Listen He kicked a stone Hear that hear that
 Hes coming towards us Joel go inplease
 HarkI dont hear him now But please go in
 In the first place you cant make me believe its
 It isor someone else hes sent to watch
 And nows the time to have it out with him
 While we know definitely where he is
 Let him get off and hell be everywhere
 Around us looking out of trees and bushes
 Till I shant dare to set a foot outdoors
 And I cant stand it Joel let me go
 But its nonsense to think hed care enough
 You mean you couldnt understand his caring
 Oh but you see he hadnt had enough
 Joel I wontI wontI promise you
 We mustnt say hard things You mustnt either
 Ill be the one if anybody goes
 But you give him the advantage with this light
 What couldnt he do to us standing here
 And if to see was what he wanted why
 He has seen all there was to see and gone
 He appeared to forget to keep his hold
 But advanced with her as she crossed the grass
 What do you want she cried to all the dark
 She stretched up tall to overlook the light
 That hung in both hands hot against her skirt
 Theres no one so youre wrong he said
 There is
 What do you want she cried and then herself
 Was startled when an answer really came
 Nothing It came from well along the road
 She reached a hand to Joel for support
 The smell of scorching woollen made her faint
 What are you doing round this house at night
 Nothing A pause there seemed no more to say
 And then the voice again You seem afraid
 I saw by the way you whipped up the horse
 Ill just come forward in the lantern light
 And let you see
 Yes doJoel go back
 She stood her ground against the noisy steps
 That came on but her body rocked a little
 You see the voice said
 Oh She looked and looked
 You dont seeIve a child here by the hand
 Whats a child doing at this time of night
 Out walking Every child should have the memory
 Of at least one longafterbedtime walk
 What son
 Then I should think youd try to find
 Somewhere to walk
 The highway as it happens
 Were stopping for the fortnight down at Deans
 But if thats allJoelyou realize
 You wont think anything You understand
 You understand that we have to be careful
 This is a very very lonely place
 Joel She spoke as if she couldnt turn
 The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground
 It touched it struck it clattered and went out




The Selfseeker

 WILLIS I didnt want you here today
 The lawyers coming for the company
 Im going to sell my soul or rather feet
 Five hundred dollars for the pair you know
 With you the feet have nearly been the soul
 And if youre going to sell them to the devil
 I want to see you do it Whens he coming
 I half suspect you knew and came on purpose
 To try to help me drive a better bargain
 Well if its true Yours are no common feet
 The lawyer dont know what it is hes buying
 So many miles you might have walked you wont walk
 You havent run your forty orchids down
 What does he thinkHow are the blessed feet
 The doctors sure youre going to walk again
 He thinks Ill hobble Its both legs and feet
 They must be terribleI mean to look at
 I havent dared to look at them uncovered
 Through the bed blankets I remind myself
 Of a starfish laid out with rigid points
 The wonder is it hadnt been your head
 Its hard to tell you how I managed it
 When I saw the shaft had me by the coat
 I didnt try too long to pull away
 Or fumble for my knife to cut away
 I just embraced the shaft and rode it out
 Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheelpit
 Thats how I think I didnt lose my head
 But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling
 Awful Why didnt they throw off the belt
 Instead of going clear down in the wheelpit
 They say some time was wasted on the belt
 Old streak of leatherdoesnt love me much
 Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles
 The way Ben Franklin used to make the kitestring
 That must be it Some days he wont stay on
 That day a woman couldnt coax him off
 Hes on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth
 Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys
 Everything goes the same without me there
 You can hear the small buzz saws whine the big saw
 Caterwaul to the hills around the village
 As they both bite the wood Its all our music
 One ought as a good villager to like it
 No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound
 And its our life
 Yes when its not our death
 You make that sound as if it wasnt so
 With everything What we live by we die by
 I wonder where my lawyer is His trains in
 I want this over with Im hot and tired
 Youre getting ready to do something foolish
 Watch for him will you Will You let him in
 Id rather Mrs Corbin didnt know
 Ive boarded here so long she thinks she owns me
 Youre bad enough to manage without her
 And Im going to be worse instead of better
 Youve got to tell me how far this is gone
 Have you agreed to any price
 Five hundred
 Five hundredfivefive One two three four five
 You neednt look at me
 I dont believe you
 I told you Willis when you first came in
 Dont you be hard on me I have to take
 What I can get You see they have the feet
 Which gives them the advantage in the trade
 I cant get back the feet in any case
 But your flowers man youre selling out your flowers
 Yes thats one way to put itall the flowers
 Of every kind everywhere in this region
 For the next forty summerscall it forty
 But Im not selling those Im giving them
 They never earned me so much as one cent
 Money cant pay me for the loss of them
 No the five hundred was the sum they named
 To pay the doctors bill and tide me over
 Its that or fight and I dont want to fight
 I just want to get settled in my life
 Such as its going to be and know the worst
 Or bestit may not be so bad The firm
 Promise me all the shooks I want to nail
 But what about your flora of the valley
 You have me there But thatyou didnt think
 That was worth money to me Still I own
 It goes against me not to finish it
 For the friends it might bring me By the way
 I had a letter from Burroughsdid I tell you
 About my Cyprepedium reginae
 He says its not reported so far north
 There theres the bell Hes rung But you go down
 And bring him up and dont let Mrs Corbin
 Oh well well soon be through with it Im tired
 Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer
 A little barefoot girl who in the noise
 Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house
 And baritone importance of the lawyer
 Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands
 Shyly behind her
 Well and how is Mister
 The lawyer was already in his satchel
 As if for papers that might bear the name
 He hadnt at command You must excuse me
 I dropped in at the mill and was detained
 Looking round I suppose said Willis
 Yes
 Well yes
 Hear anything that might prove useful
 The Broken One saw Anne Why here is Anne
 What do you want dear Come stand by the bed
 Tell me what is it Anne just wagged her dress
 With both hands held behind her Guess she said
 Oh guess which hand My my Once on a time
 I knew a lovely way to tell for certain
 By looking in the ears But I forget it
 Er let me see I think Ill take the right
 Thats sure to be right even if its wrong
 Come hold it out Dont changeA Rams Horn orchid
 A Rams Horn What would I have got I wonder
 If I had chosen left Hold out the left
 Another Rams Horn Where did you find those
 Under what beech tree on what woodchucks knoll
 Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side
 And thought she wouldnt venture on so much
 Were there no others
 There were four or five
 I knew you wouldnt let me pick them all
 I wouldntso I wouldnt Youre the girl
 You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart
 I wanted there should be some there next year
 Of course you did You left the rest for seed
 And for the backwoods woodchuck Youre the girl
 A Rams Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck
 Sounds something like Better than farmers beans
 To a discriminating appetite
 Though the Rams Horn is seldom to be had
 In bushel lotsdoesnt come on the market
 But Anne Im troubled have you told me all
 Youre hiding something Thats as bad as lying
 You ask this lawyer man And its not safe
 With a lawyer at hand to find you out
 Nothing is hidden from some people Anne
 You dont tell me that where you found a Rams Horn
 You didnt find a Yellow Ladys Slipper
 What did I tell you What Id blush I would
 Dont you defend yourself If it was there
 Where is it now the Yellow Ladys Slipper
 Well waitits commonits too common
 Common
 The Purple Ladys Slippers commoner
 I didnt bring a Purple Ladys Slipper
 To Youto you I meantheyre both too common
 The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers
 As if with some idea that she had scored
 Ive broken Anne of gathering bouquets
 Its not fair to the child It cant be helped though
 Pressed into service means pressed out of shape
 Somehow Ill make it right with hershell see
 Shes going to do my scouting in the field
 Over stone walls and all along a wood
 And by a river bank for water flowers
 The floating Heart with small leaf like a heart
 And at the sinus under water a fist
 Of little fingers all kept down but one
 And that thrust up to blossom in the sun
 As if to say You Youre the Hearts desire
 Anne has a way with flowers to take the place
 Of that shes lost she goes down on one knee
 And lifts their faces by the chin to hers
 And says their names and leaves them where they are
 The lawyer wore a watch the case of which
 Was cunningly devised to make a noise
 Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut
 At such a time as this He snapped it now
 Well Anne go dearie Our affair will wait
 The lawyer man is thinking of his train
 He wants to give me lots and lots of money
 Before he goes because I hurt myself
 And it may take him I dont know how long
 But put our flowers in water first Will help her
 The pitchers too full for her Theres no cup
 Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher
 Now runGet out your documents You see
 I have to keep on the good side of Anne
 Im a great boy to think of number one
 And you cant blame me in the place Im in
 Who will take care of my necessities
 Unless I do
 A pretty interlude
 The lawyer said Im sorry but my train
 Luckily terms are all agreed upon
 You only have to sign your name Rightthere
 You Will stop making faces Come round here
 Where you cant make them What is it you want
 Ill put you out with Anne Be good or go
 You dont mean you will sign that thing unread
 Make yourself useful then and read it for me
 Isnt it something I have seen before
 Youll find it is Let your friend look at it
 Yes but all that takes time and Im as much
 In haste to get it over with as you
 But read it read it Thats right draw the curtain
 Half the time I dont know whats troubling me
 What do you say Will Dont you be a fool
 You crumpling folkses legal documents
 Out with it if youve any real objection
 Five hundred dollars
 What would you think right
 A thousand wouldnt be a cent too much
 You know it Mr Lawyer The sin is
 Accepting anything before he knows
 Whether hes ever going to walk again
 It smells to me like a dishonest trick
 I thinkI thinkfrom what I heard today
 And saw myselfhe would be illadvised
 What did you hear for instance Willis said
 Now the place where the accident occurred
 The Broken One was twisted in his bed
 This is between you two apparently
 Where I come in is what I want to know
 You stand up to it like a pair of cocks
 Go outdoors if you want to fight Spare me
 When you come back Ill have the papers signed
 Will pencil do Then please your fountain pen
 One of you hold my head up from the pillow
 Willis flung off the bed I wash my hands
 Im no matchno and dont pretend to be
 The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen
 Youre doing the wise thing you wont regret it
 Were very sorry for you
 Willis sneered
 Whos wesome stockholders in Boston
 Ill go outdoors by gad and wont come back
 Willis bring Anne back with you when you come
 Yes Thanks for caring Dont mind Will hes savage
 He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers
 You dont know what I mean about the flowers
 Dont stop to try to now Youll miss your train
 Goodbye He flung his arms around his face




The Woodpile

 OUT walking in the frozen swamp one grey day
 I paused and said I will turn back from here
 No I will go on fartherand we shall see
 The hard snow held me save where now and then
 One foot went down The view was all in lines
 Straight up and down of tall slim trees
 Too much alike to mark or name a place by
 So as to say for certain I was here
 Or somewhere else I was just far from home
 A small bird flew before me He was careful
 To put a tree between us when he lighted
 And say no word to tell me who he was
 Who was so foolish as to think what he thought
 He thought that I was after him for a feather
 The white one in his tail like one who takes
 Everything said as personal to himself
 One flight out sideways would have undeceived him
 And then there was a pile of wood for which
 I forgot him and let his little fear
 Carry him off the way I might have gone
 Without so much as wishing him goodnight
 He went behind it to make his last stand
 It was a cord of maple cut and split
 And piledand measured four by four by eight
 And not another like it could I see
 No runner tracks in this years snow looped near it
 And it was older sure than this years cutting
 Or even last years or the years before
 The wood was grey and the bark warping off it
 And the pile somewhat sunken Clematis
 Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle
 What held it though on one side was a tree
 Still growing and on one a stake and prop
 These latter about to fall I thought that only
 Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
 Could so forget his handiwork on which
 He spent himself the labour of his axe
 And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
 To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
 With the slow smokeless burning of decay




Good Hours

 I HAD for my winter evening walk
 No one at all with whom to talk
 But I had the cottages in a row
 Up to their shining eyes in snow
 And I thought I had the folk within
 I had the sound of a violin
 I had a glimpse through curtain laces
 Of youthful forms and youthful faces
 I had such company outward bound
 I went till there were no cottages found
 I turned and repented but coming back
 I saw no window but that was black
 Over the snow my creaking feet
 Disturbed the slumbering village street
 Like profanation by your leave
 At ten oclock of a winter eve

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
