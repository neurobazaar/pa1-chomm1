CHAPTER I

At sunset hour the forest was still lonely sweet with tang of fir and
spruce blazing in gold and red and green and the man who glided on
under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and disappearing
to have become a part of the wild woodland

Old Baldy highest of the White Mountains stood up round and bare
rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun Then as the
fire dropped behind the domed peak a change a cold and darkening
blight passed down the black spearpointed slopes over all that
mountain world

It was a wild richly timbered and abundantly watered region of dark
forests and grassy parks ten thousand feet above sealevel isolated
on all sides by the southern Arizona desertthe virgin home of elk and
deer of bear and lion of wolf and fox and the birthplace as well as
the hidingplace of the fierce Apache

September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze
following shortly after sundown Twilight appeared to come on its wings
as did faint sounds not distinguishable before in the stillness

Milt Dale man of the forest halted at the edge of a timbered ridge to
listen and to watch Beneath him lay a narrow valley open and grassy
from which rose a faint murmur of running water Its music was pierced
by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote From overhead in the
giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the
night and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild
turkeys going to roost

To Dales keen ear these sounds were all they should have been
betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland He was glad for he had
expected to hear the clipclop of white mens horseswhich to hear up
in those fastnesses was hateful to him He and the Indian were friends
That fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter But there hid
somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men sheepthieves whom Dale did
not want to meet

As he started out upon the slope a sudden flaring of the afterglow of
sunset flooded down from Old Baldy filling the valley with lights and
shadows yellow and blue like the radiance of the sky The pools in the
curves of the brook shone darkly bright Dales gaze swept up and down
the valley and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook
where the wall of spruce stood up its speared and spiked crest against
the pale clouds The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a
feeling of rain in the air Dale striking a trail turned his back to
the fading afterglow and strode down the valley

With night at hand and a rainstorm brewing he did not head for his
own camp some miles distant but directed his steps toward an old log
cabin When he reached it darkness had almost set in He approached with
caution This cabin like the few others scattered in the valleys might
harbor Indians or a bear or a panther Nothing however appeared to be
there Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky and he felt
the cool dampness of a fine misty rain on his face It would rain off
and on during the night Whereupon he entered the cabin

And the next moment he heard quick hoofbeats of trotting horses
Peering out he saw dim moving forms in the darkness quite close
at hand They had approached against the wind so that sound had been
deadened Five horses with riders Dale made outsaw them loom close
Then he heard rough voices Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a
ladder he knew led to a loft and finding it he quickly mounted taking
care not to make a noise with his rifle and lay down upon the floor
of brush and poles Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps with
accompaniment of clinking spurs passed through the door below into the
cabin

Wal Beasley are you here queried a loud voice

There was no reply The man below growled under his breath and again
the spurs jingled

Fellars Beasley aint here yet he called Put the hosses under the
shed Well wait

Wait huh came a harsh reply Mebbe all nightan we got nuthin to
eat

Shut up Moze Reckon youre no good for anythin but eatin Put them
hosses away an some of you rustle firewood in here

Low muttered curses then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain
of leather and heaves of tired horses

Another shuffling clinking footstep entered the cabin

Snake itd been sense to fetch a pack along drawled this newcomer

Reckon so Jim But we didnt an whats the use hollerin Beasley
wont keep us waitin long

Dale lying still and prone felt a slow start in all his blooda
thrilling wave That deepvoiced man below was Snake Anson the worst
and most dangerous character of the region and the others undoubtedly
composed his gang long notorious in that sparsely settled country
And the Beasley mentionedhe was one of the two biggest ranchers and
sheepraisers of the White Mountain ranges What was the meaning of
a rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley Milt Dale answered that
question to Beasleys discredit and many strange matters pertaining to
sheep and herders always a mystery to the little village of Pine now
became as clear as daylight

Other men entered the cabin

It aint agoin to rain much said one Then came a crash of wood
thrown to the ground

Jim hyars a chunk of pine log dry as punk said another

Rustlings and slow footsteps and then heavy thuds attested to the
probability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to
split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured

Snake lemme your pipe an Ill hev a fire in a jiffy

Wal I want my terbacco an I aint carin about no fire replied
Snake

Reckon youre the meanest cuss in these woods drawled Jim

Sharp click of steel on flintmany timesand then a sound of hard
blowing and sputtering told of Jims efforts to start a fire Presently
the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed there came a little crackling
of wood and the rustle of flame and then a steady growing roar

As it chanced Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft and right
near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs When the fire blazed
up he was fairly well able to see the men below The only one he had
ever seen was Jim Wilson who had been well known at Pine before Snake
Anson had ever been heard of Jim was the best of a bad lot and he had
friends among the honest people It was rumored that he and Snake did
not pull well together

Fire feels good said the burly Moze who appeared as broad as he was
blackvisaged Falls sure acomin Now if only we had some grub

Moze theres a hunk of deer meat in my saddlebag an if you git it
you can have half spoke up another voice

Moze shuffled out with alacrity

In the firelight Snake Ansons face looked lean and serpentlike his
eyes glittered and his long neck and all of his long length carried out
the analogy of his name

Snake whats this here deal with Beasley inquired Jim

Reckon youll larn when I do replied the leader He appeared tired
and thoughtful

Aint we done away with enough of them poor greaser herdersfor
nothin queried the youngest of the gang a boy in years whose hard
bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades

Youre dead right Burtan thats my stand replied the man who
had sent Moze out Snake snow ll be flyin round these woods before
long said Jim Wilson Are we goin to winter down in the Tonto Basin
or over on the Gila

Reckon well do some tall ridin before we strike south replied
Snake gruffly

At the juncture Moze returned

Boss I heerd a hoss comin up the trail he said

Snake rose and stood at the door listening Outside the wind moaned
fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin

Ahuh exclaimed Snake in relief

Silence ensued then for a moment at the end of which interval Dale
heard a rapid clipclop on the rocky trail outside The men below
shuffled uneasily but none of them spoke The fire cracked cheerily
Snake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that
expressed both doubt and caution

The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere

Ho there inside called a voice from the darkness

Ho yourself replied Anson

That you Snake quickly followed the query

Reckon so returned Anson showing himself

The newcomer entered He was a large man wearing a slicker that shone
wet in the firelight His sombrero pulled well down shadowed his face
so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked
He had a black drooping mustache and a chin like a rock A potential
force matured and powerful seemed to be wrapped in his movements

Hullo Snake Hullo Wilson he said Ive backed out on the other
deal Sent for you onon another little matter particular private

Here he indicated with a significant gesture that Snakes men were to
leave the cabin

Ahuh ejaculated Anson dubiously Then he turned abruptly Moze
you an Shady an Burt go wait outside Reckon this aint the deal I
expected An you can saddle the hosses

The three members of the gang filed out all glancing keenly at the
stranger who had moved back into the shadow

All right now Beasley said Anson lowvoiced Whats your game
Jim here is in on my deals

Then Beasley came forward to the fire stretching his hands to the
blaze

Nothin to do with sheep replied he

Wal I reckoned not assented the other An saywhatever your game
is I aint likin the way you kept me waitin an ridin around We
waited near all day at Big Spring Then thet greaser rode up an sent us
here Were a long way from camp with no grub an no blankets

I wont keep you long said Beasley But even if I did youd not
mindwhen I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchinclossthe man who
made an outlaw of you

Ansons sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame Wilson
likewise bent forward eagerly Beasley glanced at the doorthen began
to whisper

Old Auchincloss is on his last legs Hes goin to croak Hes sent
back to Missouri for a niecea young girlan he means to leave his
ranches an sheepall his stock to her Seems he has no one else
Them ranchesan all them sheep an hosses You know me an Al were
pardners in sheepraisin for years He swore I cheated him an he threw
me out An all these years Ive been swearin he did me dirtowed me
sheep an money Ive got as many friends in Pinean all the way down
the trailas Auchincloss has An Snake see here

He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the
blaze Anson leaned forward like a serpent ready to strike and Jim
Wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand

See here panted Beasley The girls due to arrive at Magdalena on
the sixteenth Thats a week from tomorrow Shell take the stage to
Snowdrop where some of Auchinclosss men will meet her with a team

Ahuh grunted Anson as Beasley halted again An what of all thet

She mustnt never get as far as Snowdrop

You want me to hold up the stagean get the girl

Exactly

Walan what then

Make off with her She disappears Thats your affair  Ill
press my claims on Auchinclosshound himan be ready when he croaks
to take over his property Then the girl can come back for all I
care You an Wilson fix up the deal between you If you have to let
the gang in on it dont give them any hunch as to who an what This ll
make you a rich stake An providin when its paid you strike for new
territory

Thet might be wise muttered Snake Anson Beasley the weak point in
your game is the uncertainty of life Old Al is tough He may fool you

Auchincloss is a dyin man declared Beasley with such positiveness
that it could not be doubted

Wal he sure wasnt plumb hearty when I last seen him Beasley in
case I play your gamehowm I to know that girl

Her names Helen Rayner replied Beasley eagerly Shes twenty
years old All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an they say shes the
handsomest

Ahuh Beasley this s sure a bigger dealan one I aint
fancyin But I never doubted your word Come onan talk out
Whats in it for me

Dont let any one in on this You two can hold up the stage Why it
was never held up But you want to mask How about ten thousand
sheepor what they bring at Phenix in gold

Jim Wilson whistled low

An leave for new territory repeated Snake Anson under his breath

Youve said it

Wal I aint fancyin the girl end of this deal but you can count on
me September sixteenth at Magdalenaan her names Helenan shes
handsome

Yes My herders will begin drivin south in about two weeks Later if
the weather holds good send me word by one of them an Ill meet you

Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze pulled on his gloves
and pulled down his sombrero and with an abrupt word of parting strode
out into the night

Jim what do you make of him queried Snake Anson

Pard hes got us beat two ways for Sunday replied Wilson

Ahuh Wal lets get back to camp And he led the way out

Low voices drifted into the cabin then came snorts of horses and
striking hoofs and after that a steady trot gradually ceasing
Once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest
stillness



CHAPTER II

Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the gloom

He was thirty years old As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his
school and home in Iowa and joining a wagontrain of pioneers he was
one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White
Mountains But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheepraising or
monotonous home toil and for twelve years he had lived in the forest
with only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop This
wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for
the villagers for he did care and he was welcome everywhere but
that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive
instinctive force of a savage

And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one
of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a
friend

That man Beasley he soliloquized Beasleyin cahoots with Snake
Anson Well he was right Al Auchincloss is on his last legs Poor
old man When I tell him hell never believe ME thats sure

Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine

A girlHelen Raynertwenty years old he mused Beasley wants her
made off with That meansworse than killed

Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired
by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore Bad men worked
their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer He had shot wolves for
that trick With men good or bad he had not clashed Old women and
children appealed to him but he had never had any interest in girls
The image then of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale and he
suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley not
to befriend old Al Auchincloss but for the sake of the girl Probably
she was already on her way West alone eager hopeful of a future home
How little people guessed what awaited them at a journeys end Many
trails ended abruptly in the forestand only trained woodsmen could
read the tragedy

Strange how I cut across country today from Spruce Swamp reflected
Dale Circumstances movements usually were not strange to him His
methods and habits were seldom changed by chance The matter then of
his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason and
of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl was
indeed an adventure to provoke thought It provoked more for Dale grew
conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins He who had
little to do with the strife of men and nothing to do with anger felt
his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl

Old Al wont listen to me pondered Dale An even if he did he
wouldnt believe me Maybe nobody will All the same Snake Anson
wont get that girl

With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position and
his pondering ceased Taking his rifle he descended from the loft and
peered out of the door The night had grown darker windier cooler
broken clouds were scudding across the sky only a few stars showed
fine rain was blowing from the northwest and the forest seemed full of
a low dull roar

Reckon Id better hang up here he said and turned to the fire The
coals were red now From the depths of his huntingcoat he procured a
little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat These strips he laid
for a moment on the hot embers until they began to sizzle and curl
then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter
grateful for little

He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of
the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing glowing golden embers
Outside the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased
to a roar Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him drowsily
lulling and he heard the stormwind in the trees now like a waterfall
and anon like a retreating army and again low and sad and he saw
pictures in the glowing embers strange as dreams

Presently he rose and climbing to the loft he stretched himself out
and soon fell asleep


When the gray dawn broke he was on his way crosscountry to the
village of Pine

During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased A
suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places All was graythe
parks the gladesand deeper darker gray marked the aisles of the
forest Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent
with spectral forms Then the east kindled the gray lightened the
dreaming woodland awoke to the farreaching rays of a bursting red sun

This was always the happiest moment of Dales lonely days as sunset
was his saddest He responded and there was something in his blood that
answered the whistle of a stag from a nearby ridge His strides were
long noiseless and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the
dewladen grass

Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest
climbing but the senacasthose parklike meadows so named by Mexican
sheepherderswere as round and level as if they had been made by man
in beautiful contrast to the darkgreen rough and rugged ridges Both
open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance
of game The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the
spruces a round black lumbering object a twittering in the brush
and stealthy steps were all easy signs for Dale to read Once as he
noiselessly emerged into a little glade he espied a red fox stalking
some quarry which as he advanced proved to be a flock of partridges
They whirred up brushing the branches and the fox trotted away In
every senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the
high grass

It had always been his custom on his visits to Pine to kill and
pack fresh meat down to several old friends who were glad to give him
lodging And hurried though he was now he did not intend to make an
exception of this trip

At length he got down into the pine belt where the great gnarled
yellow trees soared aloft stately and aloof from one another and the
ground was a brown odorous springy mat of pineneedles level as a
floor Squirrels watched him from all around scurrying away at his
near approachtiny brown lightstriped squirrels and larger ones
russetcolored and the splendid darkgrays with their white bushy tails
and plumed ears

This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide gray rolling open land
almost like a prairie with foothills lifting near and far and the
redgold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun Here Dale
flushed a flock of wild turkeys upward of forty in number and their
subdued color of gray flecked with white and graceful sleek build
showed them to be hens There was not a gobbler in the flock They began
to run pellmell out into the grass until only their heads appeared
bobbing along and finally disappeared Dale caught a glimpse of
skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys and as
they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the
hindmost His bullet struck low as he had meant it to but too low and
the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pineneedles thrown up into
his face This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt
into a tree rolled over gained his feet and then the cover of the
forest Dale was amused at this His hand was against all the predatory
beasts of the forest though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf
and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the
gentle beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed But some he
loved better than others and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty

He crossed the wide grassy plain and struck another gradual descent
where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm sunlighted
glades bordered along a sparkling brook Here he heard a turkey gobble
and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching
silent detour around a clump of aspens In a sunny patch of grass
a dozen or more big gobblers stood all suspiciously facing in his
direction heads erect with that wild aspect peculiar to their species
Old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk Dale
shot two of them The others began to run like ostriches thudding over
the ground spreading their wings and with that running start launched
their heavy bodies into whirring flight They flew low at about the
height of a man from the grass and vanished in the woods

Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way Soon
he came to a break in the forest level from which he gazed down a
leaguelong slope of pine and cedar out upon the bare glistening
desert stretching away endlessly rolling out to the dim dark horizon
line

The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered
forest A road running parallel with a darkwatered swiftflowing
stream divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue
smoke drifted lazily aloft Fields of corn and fields of oats yellow
in the sunlight surrounded the village and green pastures dotted
with horses and cattle reached away to the denser woodland This site
appeared to be a natural clearing for there was no evidence of cut
timber The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral but it was serene
tranquil giving the impression of a remote community prosperous and
happy drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives

Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden
bordered with sunflowers His call was answered by an old woman gray
and bent but remarkably spry who appeared at the door

Why lands sakes if it aint Milt Dale she exclaimed in welcome

Reckon its me Mrs Cass he replied An Ive brought you a
turkey

Milt youre that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass What
a gobbler First one Ive seen this fall My man Tom used to fetch home
gobblers like that An mebbe hell come home again sometime

Her husband Tom Cass had gone into the forest years before and had
never returned But the old woman always looked for him and never gave
up hope

Men have been lost in the forest an yet come back replied Dale as
he had said to her many a time

Come right in You air hungry I know Now son when last did you eat
a fresh egg or a flapjack

You should remember he answered laughing as he followed her into a
small clean kitchen

Lawsame An thets months ago she replied shaking her gray head
Milt you should give up that wild lifean marryan have a home

You always tell me that

Yes an Ill see you do it yet Now you set there an pretty soon
Ill give you thet to eat which ll make your mouth water

Whats the news Auntie he asked

Nary news in this dead place Why nobodys been to Snowdrop in two
weeks Sary Jones died poor old soulshes better offan one of
my cows run away Milt shes wild when she gits loose in the woods
An youll have to track her cause nobody else can An John Dakkers
heifer was killed by a lion an Lem Hardens fast hossyou know his
favoritewas stole by hossthieves Lem is jest crazy An that reminds
me Milt wheres your big ranger thet youd never sell or lend

My horses are up in the woods Auntie safe I reckon from
horsethieves

Well thats a blessin Weve had some stock stole this summer Milt
an no mistake

Thus while preparing a meal for Dale the old woman went on recounting
all that had happened in the little village since his last visit Dale
enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy and it was exceedingly good
to sit at her table In his opinion nowhere else could there have been
such butter and cream such ham and eggs Besides she always had apple
pie it seemed at any time he happened in and apple pie was one of
Dales few regrets while up in the lonely forest

Hows old Al Auchincloss presently inquired Dale

Poorlypoorly sighed Mrs Cass But he tramps an rides around
same as ever Als not long for this world An Milt that reminds
metheres the biggest news you ever heard

You dont say so exclaimed Dale to encourage the excited old woman

Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece Helen Rayner Shes to
inherit all his property Weve heard much of hera purty lass they
say Now Milt Dale heres your chance Stay out of the woods an go
to work You can marry that girl

No chance for me Auntie replied Dale smiling

The old woman snorted Much you know Any girl would have you Milt
Dale if youd only throw a kerchief

Me An why Auntie he queried half amused half thoughtful When
he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the
ideas of people

Why I declare Milt you live so in the woods youre like a boy of
tenan then sometimes as old as the hills Theres no young man to
compare with you hereabouts An this girlshell have all the spunk
of the Auchinclosses

Then maybe shed not be such a catch after all replied Dale

Wal youve no cause to love them thats sure But Milt the
Auchincloss women are always good wives

Dear Auntie youre dreamin said Dale soberly I want no wife Im
happy in the woods

Air you goin to live like an Injun all your days Milt Dale she
queried sharply

I hope so

You ought to be ashamed But some lass will change you boy an mebbe
itll be this Helen Rayner I hope an pray so to thet

Auntie supposin she did change me Shed never change old Al He
hates me you know

Wal I aint so sure Milt I met Al the other day He inquired for
you an said you was wild but he reckoned men like you was good for
pioneer settlements Lord knows the good turns youve done this village
Milt old Al doesnt approve of your wild life but he never had no hard
feelins till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep

Auntie I dont believe Tom ever killed Als sheep declared Dale
positively

Wal Al thinks so an many other people replied Mrs Cass shaking
her gray head doubtfully You never swore he didnt An there was them
two sheepherders who did swear they seen him

They only saw a cougar An they were so scared they ran

Who wouldnt Thet big beast is enough to scare any one For lands
sakes dont ever fetch him down here again Ill never forgit the time
you did All the folks an children an hosses in Pine broke an run
thet day

Yes but Tom wasnt to blame Auntie hes the tamest of my pets
Didnt he try to put his head on your lap an lick your hand

Wal Milt I aint gainsayin your cougar pet didnt act better n a
lot of people I know Fer he did But the looks of him an whats been
said was enough for me

An whats all that Auntie

They say hes wild when out of your sight An thet hed trail an kill
anythin you put him after

I trained him to be just that way

Wal leave Tom to home up in the woodswhen you visit us

Dale finished his hearty meal and listened awhile longer to the old
womans talk then taking his rifle and the other turkey he bade her
goodby She followed him out

Now Milt youll come soon again wont youjest to see Als
niecewholl be here in a week

I reckon Ill drop in some day Auntie have you seen my friends
the Mormon boys

No I aint seen them an dont want to she retorted Milt Dale if
any one ever corrals you itll be Mormons

Dont worry Auntie I like those boys They often see me up in the
woods an ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh
meat

Theyre workin for Beasley now

Is that so rejoined Dale with a sudden start An what doin

Beasley is gettin so rich hes buildin a fence an didnt have
enough help so I hear

Beasley gettin rich repeated Dale thoughtfully More sheep an
horses an cattle than ever I reckon

Lawsame Why Milt Beasley aint any idea what he owns Yes hes
the biggest man in these parts since poor old Als took to failin I
reckon Als health aint none improved by Beasleys success Theyve bad
some bitter quarrels latelyso I hear Al aint what he was

Dale bade goodby again to his old friend and strode away thoughtful
and serious Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent but he
would be dangerous to oppose There did not appear much doubt of his
driving his way roughshod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine
Dale passing down the road began to meet acquaintances who had
hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings so that his
pondering was interrupted for the time being He carried the turkey to
another old friend and when he left her house he went on to the village
store This was a large log cabin roughly covered with clapboards with
a wide plank platform in front and a hitchingrail in the road Several
horses were standing there and a group of lazy shirtsleeved loungers

Ill be doggoned if it aint Milt Dale exclaimed one

Howdy Milt old buckskin Right down glad to see you greeted
another

Hello Dale You air shore good for sore eyes drawled still another

After a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth
of feeling when he met these acquaintances It faded quickly when he got
back to the intimacy of his woodland and that was because the people of
Pine with few exceptionsthough they liked him and greatly admired his
outdoor wisdomregarded him as a sort of nonentity Because he loved
the wild and preferred it to village and range life they had classed
him as not one of them Some believed him lazy others believed him
shiftless others thought him an Indian in mind and habits and there
were many who called him slowwitted Then there was another side to
their regard for him which always afforded him goodnatured amusement
Two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison another
wanted to hunt with him Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed
to Dale to recover his stolen horse Lems brother wanted a wildrunning
mare tracked and brought home Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken and
broken with patience not violence as was the method of the hardriding
boys at Pine So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish
needs all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures And
on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks as they entered
the store bore strong testimony to Dales personality

If there aint Milt Dale exclaimed the older of the two How lucky
My cows sick an the men are no good doctorin Ill jest ask Milt
over

No one like Milt responded the other woman heartily

Good day thereyou Milt Dale called the first speaker When you git
away from these lazy men come over

Dale never refused a service and that was why his infrequent visits to
Pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure

Presently Beasley strode down the street and when about to enter the
store he espied Dale

Hullo there Milt he called cordially as he came forward with
extended hand His greeting was sincere but the lightning glance he
shot over Dale was not born of his pleasure Seen in daylight Beasley
was a big bold bluff man with strong dark features His aggressive
presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy

Dale shook hands with him

How are you Beasley

Aint complainin Milt though I got more work than I can rustle
Reckon you wouldnt take a job bossin my sheepherders

Reckon I wouldnt replied Dale Thanks all the same

Whats goin on up in the woods

Plenty of turkey an deer Lots of bear too The Indians have worked
back on the south side early this fall But I reckon winter will come
late an be mild

Good An where re you headin from

Crosscountry from my camp replied Dale rather evasively

Your camp Nobody ever found that yet declared Beasley gruffly

Its up there said Dale

Reckon youve got that cougar chained in your cabin door queried
Beasley and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular
frame Also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes

Tom aint chained An I havent no cabin Beasley

You mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein
hogtied or corralled demanded Beasley

Sure he does

Beats me But then Im queer on cougars Have had many a cougar trail
me at night Aint sayin I was scared But I dont care for that brand
of varmint Milt you goin to stay down awhile

Yes Ill hang around some

Come over to the ranch Glad to see you any time Some old huntin
pards of yours are workin for me

Thanks Beasley I reckon Ill come over

Beasley turned away and took a step and then as if with an
afterthought he wheeled again

Suppose youve heard about old Al Auchincloss bein near petered out
queried Beasley A strong ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate
from his features Dale divined that Beasleys next step would be to
further his advancement by some word or hint

Widow Cass was tellin me all the news Too bad about old Al replied
Dale

Sure is Hes done for An Im sorrythough Als never been square

Beasley interrupted Dale quickly you cant say that to me Al
Auchincloss always was the whitest an squarest man in this sheep
country

Beasley gave Dale a fleeting dark glance

Dale what you think aint goin to influence feelin on this range
returned Beasley deliberately You live in the woods an

Reckon livin in the woods I might thinkan know a whole lot
interposed Dale just as deliberately The group of men exchanged
surprised glances This was Milt Dale in different aspect And Beasley
did not conceal a puzzled surprise

About whatnow he asked bluntly

Why about whats goin on in Pine replied Dale

Some of the men laughed

Shore lots goin onan no mistake put in Lem Harden

Probably the keen Beasley had never before considered Milt Dale as a
responsible person certainly never one in any way to cross his trail
But on the instant perhaps some instinct was born or he divined an
antagonism in Dale that was both surprising and perplexing

Dale Ive differences with Al Auchinclosshave had them for years
said Beasley Much of what he owns is mine An its goin to come to
me Now I reckon people will be takin sidessome for me an some for
Al Most are for me Where do you stand Al Auchincloss never had no
use for you an besides hes a dyin man Are you goin on his side

Yes I reckon I am

Wal Im glad youve declared yourself rejoined Beasley shortly
and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any
obstacle from his path

Milt thets badmakin Beasley sore at you said Lem Harden Hes
on the way to boss this outfit

Hes sure goin to step into Als boots said another

Thet was white of Milt to stick up fer poor old Al declared Lems
brother

Dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road The
burden of what he knew about Beasley weighed less heavily upon him and
the closelipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest He needed
to think before undertaking to call upon old Al Auchincloss and to that
end he sought an hours seclusion under the pines



CHAPTER III

In the afternoon Dale having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him
by his old friends at Pine directed slow steps toward the Auchincloss
ranch

The flat square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon
a little hill half a mile out of the village A home as well as a fort
it had been the first structure erected in that region and the process
of building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks
The Apaches had for some time however confined their fierce raids to
points south of the White Mountain range Auchinclosss house looked
down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes and
hundreds of acres of wellcultivated soil Fields of oats waved gray and
yellow in the afternoon sun an immense green pasture was divided by a
willowbordered brook and here were droves of horses and out on the
rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle

The whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of
man The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the
village Water for the house however came down from the high wooded
slope of the mountain and had been brought there by a simple expedient
Pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end with a deep trough
cut in them and they made a shining line down the slope across the
valley and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home Near the house
the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together making a crude
pipe Water ran uphill in this case one of the facts that made the
ranch famous as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small
boys of Pine The two good women who managed Auchinclosss large
household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into
their kitchen with the everflowing stream of clear cold mountain
water

As it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the
shade of a porch talking to some of his sheepherders and stockmen
Auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width
of shoulder He had no gray hairs and he did not look old yet there
was in his face a certain weariness something that resembled sloping
lines of distress dim and pale that told of age and the ebbtide of
vitality His features cast in large mold were cleancut and comely
and he had frank blue eyes somewhat sad yet still full of spirit

Dale had no idea how his visit would be taken and he certainly would
not have been surprised to be ordered off the place He had not set foot
there for years Therefore it was with surprise that he saw Auchincloss
wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular
expression

Howdy Al How are you greeted Dale easily as he leaned his rifle
against the log wall

Auchincloss did not rise but he offered his hand

Wal Milt Dale I reckon this is the first time I ever seen you that I
couldnt lay you flat on your back replied the rancher His tone was
both testy and full of pathos

I take it you mean you aint very well replied Dale Im sorry Al

No it aint thet Never was sick in my life Im just played out like
a hoss thet had been strong an willin an did too much Wal you
dont look a day older Milt Livin in the woods rolls over a mans
head

Yes Im feelin fine an time never bothers me

Wal mebbe you aint such a fool after all Ive wondered
latelysince I had time to think But Milt you dont git no
richer

Al I have all I want an need

Wal then you dont support anybody you dont do any good in the
world

We dont agree Al replied Dale with his slow smile

Reckon we never did An you jest come over to pay your respects to
me eh

Not altogether answered Dale ponderingly First off Id like to
say Ill pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed

You will An howd you go about that

Wasnt very many sheep was there

A matter of fifty head

So many Al do you still think old Tom killed them sheep

Humph Milt I know damn well he did

Al now how could you know somethin I dont Be reasonable now Lets
dont fall out about this again Ill pay back the sheep Work it out

Milt Dale youll come down here an work out that fifty head of
sheep ejaculated the old rancher incredulously

Sure

Wal Ill be damned He sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at Dale
Whats got into you Milt Hev you heard about my niece thets comin
an think youll shine up to her

Yes Al her comin has a good deal to do with my deal replied Dale
soberly But I never thought to shine up to her as you hint

Haw Haw Youre just like all the other colts hereabouts Reckon its
a good sign too Itll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods But
boy this niece of mine Helen Rayner will stand you on your head
I never seen her They say shes jest like her mother An Nell
Auchinclosswhat a girl she was

Dale felt his face grow red Indeed this was strange conversation for
him

Honest Al he began

Son dont lie to an old man

Lie I wouldnt lie to any one Al its only men who live in towns an
are always makin deals I live in the forest where theres nothin to
make me lie

Wal no offense meant Im sure responded Auchincloss An mebbe
theres somethin in what you say We was talkin about them sheep
your big cat killed Wal Milt I cant prove it thats sure An mebbe
youll think me doddery when I tell you my reason It wasnt what them
greaser herders said about seein a cougar in the herd

What was it then queried Dale much interested

Wal thet day a year ago I seen your pet He was lyin in front of the
store an you was inside tradin fer supplies I reckon It was like
meetin an enemy face to face Because damn me if I didnt know that
cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes There

The old rancher expected to be laughed at But Dale was grave

Al I know how you felt he replied as if they were discussing an
action of a human being Sure Id hate to doubt old Tom But hes a
cougar An the ways of animals are strange Anyway Al Ill make
good the loss of your sheep

No you wont rejoined Auchincloss quickly Well call it off Im
takin it square of you to make the offer Thets enough So forget your
worry about work if you had any

Theres somethin else Al I wanted to say began Dale with
hesitation An its about Beasley

Auchincloss started violently and a flame of red shot into his face
Then he raised a big hand that shook Dale saw in a flash how the old
mans nerves had gone

Dont mentionthetthet greaserto me burst out the rancher It
makes me seered Dale I aint overlookin that you spoke up fer
me todaystood fer my side Lem Harden told me I was glad An thets
whytodayI forgot our old quarrel But not a word about thet
sheepthiefor Ill drive you off the place

But Albe reasonable remonstrated Dale Its necessary thet I
speak ofof Beasley

It aint Not to me I wont listen

Reckon youll have to Al returned Dale Beasleys after your
property Hes made a deal

By Heaven I know that shouted Auchincloss tottering up with his
face now blackred Do you think thets new to me Shut up Dale I
cant stand it

But Altheres worse went on Dale hurriedly Worse Your lifes
threatenedan your niece Helenshes to be

Shut upan clear out roared Auchincloss waving his huge fists

He seemed on the verge of a collapse as shaking all over he backed
into the door A few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful
old man

But AlIm your friend began Dale appealingly

Friend hey returned the rancher with grim bitter passion Then
youre the only one Milt Dale Im rich an Im a dyin man I trust
nobody But you wild hunterif youre my friendprove it Go
kill thet greaser sheepthief DO somethinan then come talk to me

With that he lurched half falling into the house and slammed the
door

Dale stood there for a blank moment and then taking up his rifle he
strode away

Toward sunset Dale located the camp of his four Mormon friends and
reached it in time for supper

John Roy Joe and Hal Beeman were sons of a pioneer Mormon who had
settled the little community of Snowdrop They were young men in years
but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured
Only a years difference in age stood between John and Roy and between
Roy and Joe and likewise Joe and Hal When it came to appearance they
were difficult to distinguish from one another Horsemen sheepherders
cattleraisers huntersthey all possessed long wiry powerful frames
lean bronzed still faces and the quiet keen eyes of men used to the
open

Their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens
some three miles from Pine and though working for Beasley near
the village they had ridden to and fro from camp after the habit of
seclusion peculiar to their kind

Dale and the brothers had much in common and a warm regard had sprang
up But their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things
pertaining to the forest Dale ate supper with them and talked as usual
when he met them without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his
mind After the meal he helped Joe round up the horses hobble them for
the night and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines Later
when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind and the
campfire glowed comfortably Dale broached the subject that possessed
him

An so youre working for Beasley he queried by way of starting
conversation

We was drawled John But today bein the end of our month we got
our pay an quit Beasley sure was sore

Whyd you knock off

John essayed no reply and his brothers all had that quiet suppressed
look of knowledge under restraint

Listen to what I come to tell you then youll talk went on Dale And
hurriedly he told of Beasleys plot to abduct Al Auchinclosss niece and
claim the dying mans property

When Dale ended rather breathlessly the Mormon boys sat without any
show of surprise or feeling John the eldest took up a stick and
slowly poked the red embers of the fire making the white sparks fly

Now Milt whyd you tell us thet he asked guardedly

Youre the only friends Ive got replied Dale It didnt seem safe
for me to talk down in the village I thought of you boys right off I
aint goin to let Snake Anson get that girl An I need help so I come
to you

Beasleys strong around Pine an old Als weakenin Beasley will git
the property girl or no girl said John

Things dont always turn out as they look But no matter about that
The girl deal is what riled me Shes to arrive at Magdalena on
the sixteenth an take stage for Snowdrop Now what to do If she
travels on that stage Ill be on it you bet But she oughtnt to be in
it at all  Boys somehow Im goin to save her Will you help me I
reckon Ive been in some tight corners for you Sure this s different
But are you my friends You know now what Beasley is An youre all
lost at the hands of Snake Ansons gang Youve got fast hosses eyes
for trackin an you can handle a rifle Youre the kind of fellows Id
want in a tight pinch with a bad gang Will you stand by me or see me go
alone

Then John Beeman silently and with pale face gave Dales hand a
powerful grip and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise
Their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered
around their thin lips

Milt mebbe we know what Beasley is better n you said John at
length He ruined my father Hes cheated other Mormons We boys have
proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep Ansons gang steals An
drives the herds to Phenix Our people wont let us accuse Beasley So
weve suffered in silence My father always said let some one else say
the first word against Beasley an youve come to us

Roy Beeman put a hand on Dales shoulder He perhaps was the keenest
of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most
He had been oftenest with Dale on many a long trail and he was the
hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country

An were goin with you he said in a strong and rolling voice

They resumed their seats before the fire John threw on more wood and
with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up fanned by the wind
As twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a
roar A pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries

The five young men conversed long and earnestly considering planning
rejecting ideas advanced by each Dale and Roy Beeman suggested most of
what became acceptable to all Hunters of their type resembled explorers
in slow and deliberate attention to details What they had to deal with
here was a situation of unlimited possibilities the horses and outfit
needed a long detour to reach Magdalena unobserved the rescue of a
strange girl who would no doubt be selfwilled and determined to ride
on the stagethe rescue forcible if necessary the fight and the
inevitable pursuit the flight into the forest and the safe delivery of
the girl to Auchincloss

Then Milt will we go after Beasley queried Roy Beeman
significantly

Dale was silent and thoughtful

Sufficient unto the day said John An fellars lets go to bed

They rolled out their tarpaulins Dale sharing Roys blankets and soon
were asleep while the red embers slowly faded and the great roar of
wind died down and the forest stillness set in



CHAPTER IV

Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twentyfour
hours before she made an alarming discovery

Accompanied by her sister Bo a precocious girl of sixteen Helen had
left St Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at
home yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life
in the Far West All her people had the pioneer spirit love of change
action adventure was in her blood Then duty to a widowed mother
with a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich
uncles offer She had taught school and also her little brothers and
sisters she had helped along in other ways And now though the
tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard this opportunity was
irresistible in its call The prayer of her dreams had been answered To
bring good fortune to her family to take care of this beautiful wild
little sister to leave the yellow sordid humdrum towns for the great
rolling boundless open to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day
to be her own to have fulfilled a deep instinctive and undeveloped
love of horses cattle sheep of desert and mountain of trees and
brooks and wild flowersall this was the sum of her most passionate
longings now in some marvelous fairylike way to come true

A check to her happy anticipations a blank sickening dash of cold
water upon her warm and intimate dreams had been the discovery
that Harve Riggs was on the train His presence could mean only one
thingthat he had followed her Riggs had been the worst of many
sore trials back there in St Joseph He had possessed some claim or
influence upon her mother who favored his offer of marriage to Helen
he was neither attractive nor good nor industrious nor anything that
interested her he was the boastful strutting adventurer not genuinely
Western and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety Helen had
suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his
and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be badas
Western men were bad But on the train in the station at La Junta one
glimpse of him manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of
her sight warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands

The recognition sobered her All was not to be a road of roses to this
new home in the West Riggs would follow her if he could not accompany
her and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything Helen felt the
startling realization of being cast upon her own resources and then
a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness But these
feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her
temper Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to
it She would not have been Al Auchinclosss niece if she had faltered
And when temper was succeeded by genuine anger she could have laughed
to scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes whatever they were Once
and for all she dismissed fear of him When she left St Joseph she had
faced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of
that West Homes had to be made out there in that far country so Uncle
Al had written and women were needed to make homes She meant to be one
of these women and to make of her sister another And with the thought
that she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached
her sooner or later Helen dismissed him from mind

While the train was in motion enabling Helen to watch the everchanging
scenery and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in
hand at stations she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests
and the red rocky gullies and the dim bold mountains She saw the sun
set over distant ranges of New Mexicoa golden blaze of glory as new
to her as the strange fancies born in her thrilling and fleeting by
Bos raptures were not silent and the instant the sun sank and the
color faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge
basket of food they had brought from home

They had two seats facing each other at the end of the coach and
piled there with the basket on top was luggage that constituted all
the girls owned in the world Indeed it was very much more than they
had ever owned before because their mother in her care for them and
desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle had spent
money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes

The girls sat together with the heavy basket on their knees and ate
while they gazed out at the cool dark ridges The train clattered
slowly on apparently over a road that was all curves And it was
suppertime for everybody in that crowded coach If Helen had not been
so absorbed by the great wild mountainland she would have had more
interest in the passengers As it was she saw them and was amused
and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car all
middleclass people poor and hopeful traveling out there to the New
West to find homes It was splendid and beautiful this fact yet it
inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness From the train window that
world of forest and crag with its long bare reaches between seemed so
lonely so wild so unlivable How endless the distance For hours and
miles upon miles no house no hut no Indian tepee It was amazing the
length and breadth of this beautiful land And Helen who loved brooks
and running streams saw no water at all

Then darkness settled down over the slowmoving panorama a cool night
wind blew in at the window white stars began to blink out of the blue
The sisters with hands clasped and heads nestled together went to
sleep under a heavy cloak


Early the next morning while the girls were again delving into their
apparently bottomless basket the train stopped at Las Vegas

Look Look cried Bo in thrilling voice Cowboys Oh Nell look

Helen laughing looked first at her sister and thought how most of all
she was good to look at Bo was little instinct with pulsating life
and she had chestnut hair and darkblue eyes These eyes were flashing
roguish and they drew like magnets

Outside on the rude station platform were railroad men Mexicans and
a group of lounging cowboys Long lean bowlegged fellows they were
with young frank faces and intent eyes One of them seemed particularly
attractive with his superb build his redbronze face and brightred
scarf his swinging gun and the huge long curved spurs Evidently
he caught Bos admiring gaze for with a word to his companions he
sauntered toward the window where the girls sat His gait was singular
almost awkward as if he was not accustomed to walking The long spurs
jingled musically He removed his sombrero and stood at ease frank
cool smiling Helen liked him on sight and looking to see what effect
he had upon Bo she found that young lady staring frightened stiff

Good mawnin drawled the cowboy with slow goodhumored smile Now
where might youall be travelin

The sound of his voice the cleancut and droll geniality seemed new
and delightful to Helen

We go to Magdalenathen take stage for the White Mountains replied
Helen

The cowboys still intent eyes showed surprise

Apache country miss he said I reckon Im sorry Thets shore no
place for youall Beggin your pawdinyou aint Mormons

No Were nieces of Al Auchincloss rejoined Helen

Wal you dont say Ive been down Magdalena way an heerd of Al
Reckon youre goin avisitin

Its to be home for us

Shore thets fine The West needs girls Yes Ive heerd of Al
An old Arizona cattleman in a sheep country Thets bad Now Im
wonderinif Id drift down there an ask him for a job ridin for
himwould I get it

His lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal
water The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen The last year or
two since Bo had grown prettier all the time she had been a magnet for
admiring glances This one of the cowboys inspired respect and liking
as well as amusement It certainly was not lost upon Bo

My uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his
ranch replied Helen smiling

Shore Ill go I reckon Id jest naturally drift that waynow

He seemed so laconic so easy so nice that he could not have been
taken seriously yet Helens quick perceptions registered a daring a
something that was both sudden and inevitable in him His last word was
as clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo

Helen had a mischievous trait which subdue it as she would
occasionally cropped out and Bo who once in her wilful life had been
rendered speechless offered such a temptation

Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for youto Uncle Al
said Helen Just then the train jerked and started slowly The cowboy
took two long strides beside the car his heated boyish face almost on a
level with the window his eyes now shy and a little wistful yet bold
too fixed upon Bo

GoodbySweetheart he called

He haltedwas lost to view

Well ejaculated Helen contritely half sorry half amused What a
sudden young gentleman

Bo had blushed beautifully

Nell wasnt he glorious she burst out with eyes shining

Id hardly call him that but he wasnice replied Helen much
relieved that Bo had apparently not taken offense at her

It appeared plain that Bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the
window and to wave her hand But she only peeped out manifestly to her
disappointment

Do you think hehell come to Uncle Als asked Bo

Child he was only in fun

Nell Ill bet you he comes Oh itd be great Im going to love
cowboys They dont look like that Harve Riggs who ran after you so

Helen sighed partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor and
partly because Bos future already called mysteriously to the child
Helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense
and wilful spirit

One of the trainmen directed the girls attention to a green sloping
mountain rising to a bold blunt bluff of bare rock and calling
it Starvation Peak he told a story of how Indians had once driven
Spaniards up there and starved them Bo was intensely interested and
thereafter she watched more keenly than ever and always had a question
for a passing trainman The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her
and then the train got out into Indian country where pueblos appeared
near the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild
mustangsthen she was enraptured

But these Indians are peaceful she exclaimed once regretfully

Gracious child You dont want to see hostile Indians do you
queried Helen

I do you bet was the frank rejoinder

Well ILL bet that Ill be sorry I didnt leave you with mother

Nellyou never will


They reached Albuquerque about noon and this important station where
they had to change trains had been the first dreaded anticipation of
the journey It certainly was a busy placefull of jabbering Mexicans
stalking redfaced wickedlooking cowboys lolling Indians In the
confusion Helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness
with Bo to watch and all that baggage to carry and the other train to
find but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped
them off the train into the othera service for which Helen was very
grateful

Albuquerques a hard place confided the trainman Better stay in the
carand dont hang out the windows Good luck to you

Only a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the
forward end This branch train consisted of one passengercoach with a
baggagecar attached to a string of freightcars Helen told herself
somewhat grimly that soon she would know surely whether or not her
suspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant If he was going on to Magdalena
on that day he must go in this coach Presently Bo who was not obeying
admonitions drew her head out of the window Her eyes were wide in
amaze her mouth open

Nell I saw that man Riggs she whispered Hes going to get on this
train

Bo I saw him yesterday replied Helen soberly

Hes followed youthethe

Now Bo dont get excited remonstrated Helen Weve left home now
Weve got to take things as they come Never mind if Riggs has followed
me Ill settle him

Oh Then you wont speakhave anything to do with him

I wont if I can help it

Other passengers boarded the train dusty uncouth ragged men and
some hardfeatured poorly clad women marked by toil and several more
Mexicans With bustle and loud talk they found their several seats

Then Helen saw Harve Riggs enter burdened with much luggage He was a
man of about medium height of dark flashy appearance cultivating long
black mustache and hair His apparel was striking as it consisted of
black frockcoat black trousers stuffed in high fancytopped boots
an embroidered vest and flowing tie and a black sombrero His belt and
gun were prominent It was significant that he excited comment among the
other passengers

When he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself
and turning abruptly approached the seat occupied by the girls When
he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite took off
his sombrero and deliberately looked at Helen His eyes were light
glinting with hard restless quiver and his mouth was coarse and
arrogant Helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings
and now the difference struck cold upon her heart

Hello Nell he said Surprised to see me

No she replied coldly

Ill gamble you are

Harve Riggs I told you the day before I left home that nothing you
could do or say mattered to me

Reckon that aint so Nell Any woman I keep track of has reason to
think An you know it

Then you followed meout here demanded Helen and her voice despite
her control quivered with anger

I sure did he replied and there was as much thought of himself in
the act as there was of her

Why Why Its uselesshopeless

I swore Id have you or nobody else would he replied and here in
the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for
a womans love But I reckon Id have struck West anyhow sooner or
later

Youre not going toall the wayto Pine faltered Helen momentarily
weakening

Nell Ill camp on your trail from now on he declared

Then Bo sat boltupright with pale face and flashing eyes

Harve Riggs you leave Nell alone she burst out in ringing brave
young voice Ill tell you whatIll betif you follow her and
nag her any more my uncle Al or some cowboy will run you out of the
country

Hello Pepper replied Riggs coolly I see your manners havent
improved an youre still wild about cowboys

People dont have good manners withwith

Bo hush admonished Helen It was difficult to reprove Bo just then
for that young lady had not the slightest fear of Riggs Indeed she
looked as if she could slap his face And Helen realized that however
her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a
wild country and whatever her determination to be brave the actual
beginning of selfreliance had left her spirit weak She would rise
out of that But just now this flashingeyed little sister seemed a
protector Bo would readily adapt herself to the West Helen thought
because she was so young primitive elemental

Whereupon Bo turned her back to Riggs and looked out of the window The
man laughed Then he stood up and leaned over Helen

Nell Im goin wherever you go he said steadily You can take that
friendly or not just as it pleases you But if youve got any sense
youll not give these people out here a hunch against me I might hurt
somebody An wouldnt it be betterto act friends For Im goin to
look after you whether you like it or not

Helen had considered this man an annoyance and later a menace and now
she must declare open enmity with him However disgusting the idea that
he considered himself a factor in her new life it was the truth He
existed he had control over his movements She could not change that
She hated the need of thinking so much about him and suddenly with a
hot bursting anger she hated the man

Youll not look after me Ill take care of myself she said and
she turned her back upon him She heard him mutter under his breath and
slowly move away down the car Then Bo slipped a hand in hers

Never mind Nell she whispered You know what old Sheriff Haines
said about Harve Riggs A fourflush wouldbe gunfighter If he ever
strikes a real Western town hell get run out of it I just wish my
redfaced cowboy had got on this train

Helen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to Bos wild
importunities to take her West The spirit which had made Bo
incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out
in this free country Yet Helen with all her warmth and gratefulness
had to laugh at her sister

Your redfaced cowboy Why Bo you were scared stiff And now you
claim him

I certainly could love that fellow replied Bo dreamily

Child youve been saying that about fellows for a long time And
youve never looked twice at any of them yet

He was different Nell Ill bet he comes to Pine

I hope he does I wish he was on this train I liked his looks Bo

Well Nell dear he looked at ME first and lastso dont get your
hopes up Oh the trains starting Goodby Albukerwhats that
awful name Nell lets eat dinner Im starved

Then Helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future and what with
listening to Bos chatter and partaking again of the endless good
things to eat in the huge basket and watching the noble mountains she
drew once more into happy mood

The valley of the Rio Grande opened to view wide near at hand in a
great graygreen gap between the bare black mountains narrow in the
distance where the yellow river wound away glistening under a hot
sun Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that
darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by and she exclaimed her
pleasure in the Indians and the mustangs and particularly in a group
of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses Helen saw all Bo pointed
out but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung
longest and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something
from her She had never before experienced any feeling like that she
had never seen a tenth so far And the sight awoke something strange
in her The sun was burning hot as she could tell when she put a hand
outside the window and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the
train She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest
were the sun and the dust and the wind And her realization made her
love them It was there the open the wild the beautiful the lonely
land and she felt the poignant call of blood in herto seek to
strive to find to live One look down that yellow valley endless
between its dark iron ramparts had given her understanding of her
uncle She must be like him in spirit as it was claimed she resembled
him otherwise

At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life and
with her bright head on the faded cloak she went to sleep But Helen
kept steady farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain and
during the long hours as she watched through clouds of dust and veils
of heat some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to
change and then to fix It was her physical acceptanceher eyes and her
senses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit

A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her Helen believed
and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living How
could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous
vastness of bare earth and open sky where the need to achieve made
thinking and pondering superficial

It was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio
Grande and then of its paralleled mountain ranges But the miles
brought compensation in other valleys other bold black upheavals of
rock and then again bare boundless yellow plains and sparsely cedared
ridges and white dry washes ghastly in the sunlight and dazzling
beds of alkali and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers
bloomed

She noted too that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had
begun to shade to redand this she knew meant an approach to
Arizona Arizona the wild the lonely the red desert the green
plateauArizona with its thundering rivers its unknown spaces its
pasturelands and timberlands its wild horses cowboys outlaws
wolves and lions and savages As to a boy that name stirred and
thrilled and sang to her of nameless sweet intangible things
mysterious and all of adventure But she being a girl of twenty who
had accepted responsibilities must conceal the depths of her heart and
that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being
born a boy

Time passed while Helen watched and learned and dreamed The train
stopped at long intervals at wayside stations where there seemed
nothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans and dust and heat Bo awoke
and began to chatter and to dig into the basket She learned from the
conductor that Magdalena was only two stations on And she was full of
conjectures as to who would meet them what would happen So Helen was
drawn back to sober realities in which there was considerable zest
Assuredly she did not know what was going to happen Twice Riggs passed
up and down the aisle his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile
deliberately forced upon her sight But again Helen fought a growing
dread with contemptuous scorn This fellow was not half a man It was
not conceivable what he could do except annoy her until she arrived
at Pine Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop which
place Helen knew was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena
This stageride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey in
Helens considerations

Oh Nell cried Bo with delight Were nearly there Next station
the conductor said

I wonder if the stage travels at night said Helen thoughtfully

Sure it does replied the irrepressible Bo

The train though it clattered along as usual seemed to Helen to fly
There the sun was setting over bleak New Mexican bluffs Magdalena was
at hand and night and adventure Helens heart beat fast She
watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed their presence and
irrigation ditches and cottonwoodtrees told her that the railroad part
of the journey was nearly ended Then at Bos little scream she
looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low flat
redadobe houses The train began to slow down Helen saw children run
white children and Mexican together then more houses and high upon a
hill an immense adobe church crude and glaring yet somehow beautiful

Helen told Bo to put on her bonnet and performing a like office for
herself she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers There were
bustle and talk in the car

The train stopped Helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of
Mexicans and Indians all motionless and stolid as if trains or nothing
else mattered Next Helen saw a white man and that was a relief He
stood out in front of the others Tall and broad somehow striking he
drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in grayfringed
buckskin and carrying a rifle



CHAPTER V

Here there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their
luggage Helen bade Bo take her share thus burdened they made an
awkward and laborious shift to get off the train

Upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized Helens heavy bag
with which she was straining and a loud voice called out

Girls were heresure out in the wild an woolly West

The speaker was Riggs and he had possessed himself of part of her
baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious
crowd than to be really kind In the excitement of arriving Helen
had forgotten him The manner of sudden reminderthe insincerity of
itmade her temper flash She almost fell encumbered as she was in
her hurry to descend the steps She saw the tall hunter in gray step
forward close to her as she reached for the bag Riggs held

Mr Riggs Ill carry my bag she said

Let me lug this You help Bo with hers he replied familiarly

But I want it she rejoined quietly with sharp determination No
little force was needed to pull the bag away from Riggs

See here Helen you aint goin any farther with that joke are you
he queried deprecatingly and he still spoke quite loud

Its no joke to me replied Helen I told you I didnt want your
attention

Sure But that was temper Im your friendfrom your home town An I
aint goin to let a quarrel keep me from lookin after you till youre
safe at your uncles

Helen turned her back upon him The tall hunter had just helped Bo off
the car Then Helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing
gray eyes

Are you Helen Rayner he asked

Yes

My names Dale Ive come to meet you

Ah My uncle sent you added Helen in quick relief

No I cant say Al sent me began the man but I reckon

He was interrupted by Riggs who grasping Helen by the arm pulled her
back a step

Say mister did Auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here
he demanded arrogantly

Dales glance turned from Helen to Riggs She could not read this quiet
gray gaze but it thrilled her

No I come on my own hook he answered

Youll understand thentheyre in my charge added Riggs

This time the steady lightgray eyes met Helens and if there was not a
smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled

Helen I reckon you said you didnt want this fellows attention

I certainly said that replied Helen quickly Just then Bo slipped
close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze Probably Bos thought
was like hershere was a real Western man That was her first
impression and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased
nerves

Riggs swaggered closer to Dale

Say Buckskin I hail from Texas

Youre wastin our time an weve need to hurry interrupted Dale His
tone seemed friendly An if you ever lived long in Texas you wouldnt
pester a lady an you sure wouldnt talk like you do

What shouted Riggs hotly He dropped his right hand significantly to
his hip

Dont throw your gun It might go off said Dale

Whatever Riggss intention had beenand it was probably just what Dale
evidently had read ithe now flushed an angry red and jerked at his
gun

Dales hand flashed too swiftly for Helens eye to follow it But she
heard the thud as it struck The gun went flying to the platform and
scattered a group of Indians and Mexicans

Youll hurt yourself some day said Dale

Helen had never heard a slow cool voice like this hunters Without
excitement or emotion or hurry it yet seemed full and significant of
things the words did not mean Bo uttered a strange little exultant cry

Riggss arm had dropped limp No doubt it was numb He stared and his
predominating expression was surprise As the shuffling crowd began to
snicker and whisper Riggs gave Dale a malignant glance shifted it to
Helen and then lurched away in the direction of his gun

Dale did not pay any more attention to him Gathering up Helens
baggage he said Come on and shouldered a lane through the gaping
crowd The girls followed close at his heels

Nell what d I tell you whispered Bo Oh youre all atremble

Helen was aware of her unsteadiness anger and fear and relief in quick
succession had left her rather weak Once through the motley crowd
of loungers she saw an old gray stagecoach and four lean horses A
grizzled sunburned man sat on the drivers seat whip and reins in
hand Beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees Another
man young tall lean dark stood holding the coach door open He
touched his sombrero to the girls His eyes were sharp as he addressed
Dale

Milt wasnt you held up

No But some longhaired galoot was tryin to hold up the girls
Wanted to throw his gun on me I was sure scared replied Dale as he
deposited the luggage

Bo laughed Her eyes resting upon Dale were warm and bright The
young man at the coach door took a second look at her and then a smile
changed the dark hardness of his face

Dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage and then placing
the lighter luggage in with them he threw the heavier pieces on top

Joe climb up he said

Wal Milt drawled the driver lets ooze along

Dale hesitated with his hand on the door He glanced at the crowd now
edging close again and then at Helen

I reckon I ought to tell you he said and indecision appeared to
concern him

What exclaimed Helen

Bad news But talkin takes time An we mustnt lose any

Theres need of hurry queried Helen sitting up sharply

I reckon

Is this the stage to Snowdrop

No That leaves in the mornin We rustled this old trap to get a start
tonight

The sooner the better But II dont understand said Helen
bewildered

Itll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin stage returned Dale

Safe Oh what do you mean exclaimed Helen Apprehensively she gazed
at him and then back at Bo

Explainin will take time An facts may change your mind But if you
cant trust me

Trust you interposed Helen blankly You mean to take us to
Snowdrop

I reckon wed better go roundabout an not hit Snowdrop he replied
shortly

Then to Pineto my uncleAl Auchincloss

Yes Im goin to try hard

Helen caught her breath She divined that some peril menaced her She
looked steadily with all a womans keenness into this mans face The
moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store
for her Her future and that of Bos were now to be dependent upon her
judgments It was a hard moment and though she shivered inwardly she
welcomed the initial and inevitable step This man Dale by his dress of
buckskin must be either scout or hunter His size his action the tone
of his voice had been reassuring But Helen must decide from what she
saw in his face whether or not to trust him And that face was
clear bronze unlined unshadowed like a tranquil mask cleancut
strongjawed with eyes of wonderful transparent gray

Yes Ill trust you she said Get in and let us hurry Then you can
explain

All ready Bill Send em along called Dale

He had to stoop to enter the stage and once in he appeared to fill
that side upon which he sat Then the driver cracked his whip the
stage lurched and began to roll the motley crowd was left behind Helen
awakened to the reality as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the
hunter that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began
with the rattling roll of that old stagecoach

Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward holding his rifle between
his knees The light shone better upon his features now that he was
bareheaded Helen had never seen a face like that which at first glance
appeared darkly bronzed and hard and then became clear cold aloof
still intense She wished she might see a smile upon it And now that
the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it There was
singular force in it but she did not recognize what kind of force One
instant she thought it was stern and the next that it was sweet and
again that it was neither

Im glad youve got your sister he said presently

How did you know shes my sister

I reckon she looks like you

No one else ever thought so replied Helen trying to smile

Bo had no difficulty in smiling as she said Wish I was half as pretty
as Nell

Nell Isnt your name Helen queried Dale

Yes But mysome few call me Nell

I like Nell better than Helen An whats yours went on Dale looking
at Bo

Mines Bo Just plain Bo Isnt it silly But I wasnt asked when they
gave it to me she replied

Bo Its nice an short Never heard it before But I havent met many
people for years

Oh weve left the town cried Bo Look Nell How bare Its just
like desert

It is desert Weve forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a
tree

Helen glanced out A flat dullgreen expanse waved away from the road
on and on to a bright dark horizonline where the sun was setting
rayless in a clear sky Open desolate and lonely the scene gave her a
cold thrill

Did your uncle Al ever write anythin about a man named Beasley asked
Dale

Indeed he did replied Helen with a start of surprise Beasley That
name is familiar to usand detestable My uncle complained of this man
for years Then he grew bitteraccused Beasley But the last year or so
not a word

Well now began the hunter earnestly lets get the bad news over
Im sorry you must be worried But you must learn to take the West as it
is Theres good an bad maybe more bad Thats because the countrys
young So to come right out with itthis Beasley hired a gang of
outlaws to meet the stage you was goin in to Snowdroptomorrowan
to make off with you

Make off with me ejaculated Helen bewildered

Kidnap you Which in that gang would be worse than killing you
declared Dale grimly and he closed a huge fist on his knee

Helen was utterly astounded

How horrible she gasped out Make off with me What in Heavens
name for

Bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance

For reasons you ought to guess replied Dale and he leaned forward
again Neither his voice nor face changed in the least but yet there
was a something about him that fascinated Helen Im a hunter I live
in the woods A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm
an I took to an old log cabin Soon as I got there I heard horses
I hid up in the loft Some men rode up an come in It was dark They
couldnt see me An they talked It turned out they were Snake Anson
an his gang of sheepthieves They expected to meet Beasley there
Pretty soon he came He told Anson how old Al your uncle was on his
last legshow he had sent for you to have his property when he died
Beasley swore he had claims on Al An he made a deal with Anson to get
you out of the way He named the day you were to reach Magdalena With
Al dead an you not there Beasley could get the property An then he
wouldnt care if you did come to claim it It d be too late Well
they rode away that night An next day I rustled down to Pine Theyre
all my friends at Pine except old Al But they think Im queer I
didnt want to confide in many people Beasley is strong in Pine an
for that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides
Beasley So I went to see your uncle He never had any use for me
because he thought I was lazy like an Indian Old Al hates lazy men
Then we fell outor he fell outbecause he believed a tame lion of
mine had killed some of his sheep An now I reckon that Tom might have
done it I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasleys about you but
old Al wouldnt listen Hes crossvery cross An when I tried to tell
him why he went right out of his head Sent me off the ranch Now I
reckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in Finally I went to four
friends I could trust Theyre Mormon boysbrothers Thats Joe out
on top with the driver I told them all about Beasleys deal an asked
them to help me So we planned to beat Anson an his gang to Magdalena
It happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine
An we had to go careful But the boys had a couple of friends
hereMormons too who agreed to help us They had this old stage
An here you are Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at
Helen and then at Bo

Youre perfectly splendid cried Bo ringingly She was white her
fingers were clenched her eyes blazed

Dale appeared startled out of his gravity and surprised then pleased
A smile made his face like a boys Helen felt her body all rigid yet
slightly trembling Her hands were cold The horror of this revelation
held her speechless But in her heart she echoed Bos exclamation of
admiration and gratitude

So far then resumed Dale with a heavy breath of relief No wonder
youre upset Ive a blunt way of talkin Now weve thirty miles to
ride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off Today sometime the
rest of the boysRoy John an Halwere to leave Show Down whichs
a town farther on from Snowdrop They have my horses an packs besides
their own Somewhere on the road well meet themtonight maybeor
tomorrow I hope not tonight because that d mean Ansons gang was
ridin in to Magdalena

Helen wrung her hands helplessly

Oh have I no courage she whispered

Nell Im as scared as you are said Bo consolingly embracing her
sister

I reckon thats natural said Dale as if excusing them But scared
or not you both brace up Its a bad job But Ive done my best An
youll be safer with me an the Beeman boys than youd be in Magdalena
or anywhere else except your uncles

MrMr Dale faltered Helen with her tears falling dont think me
a cowardoror ungrateful Im neither Its only Im soso shocked
After all we hoped and expectedthisthisis such aa terrible
surprise

Never mind Nell dear Lets take what comes murmured Bo

Thats the talk said Dale You see Ive come right out with the
worst Maybe well get through easy When we meet the boys well take to
the horses an the trails Can you ride

Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well
responded Helen The idea of riding quickened her spirit

Good We may have some hard ridin before I get you up to Pine Hello
Whats that

Above the creaking rattling rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a
rapid beat of hoofs A horse flashed by galloping hard

Dale opened the door and peered out The stage rolled to a halt He
stepped down and gazed ahead

Joe who was that he queried

Nary me An Bill didnt know him either replied Joe I seen him
way back He was ridin some An he slowed up goin past us Now hes
runnin again

Dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances

Milt hell never get by Roy on this road said Joe

Maybe hell get by before Roy strikes in on the road

It aint likely

Helen could not restrain her fears Mr Dale you think he was a
messengergoing ahead to post thatthat Anson gang

He might be replied Dale simply

Then the young man called Joe leaned out from the seat above and called
Miss Helen dont you worry Thet fellar is more liable to stop lead
than anythin else

His words meant to be kind and reassuring were almost as sinister to
Helen as the menace to her own life Long had she known how cheap life
was held in the West but she had only known it abstractly and she had
never let the fact remain before her consciousness This cheerful young
man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf The thought it roused
was tragicfor bloodshed was insupportable to herand then the thrills
which followed were so new strange bold and tingling that they were
revolting Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths of instincts at
which she was amazed and ashamed

Joe hand down that basket of grubthe small one with the canteen
said Dale reaching out a long arm Presently he placed a clothcovered
basket inside the stage Girls eat all you want an then some

We have a basket half full yet replied Helen

Youll need it all before we get to Pine Now Ill ride up on top
with the boys an eat my supper Itll be dark presently an well
stop often to listen But dont be scared

With that he took his rifle and closing the door clambered up to the
drivers seat Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along

Not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way Bo
reached for the basket of food Helen simply stared at her

Bo you CANT EAT she exclaimed

I should smile I can replied that practical young lady And youre
going to if I have to stuff things in your mouth Wheres your wits
Nell He said we must eat That means our strength is going to have some
pretty severe trials Gee its all greatjust like a story The
unexpectedwhy he looks like a prince turned hunterlong dark
stage journeyheld upfightescapewild ride on horseswoods
and camps and wild placespursuedhidden in the forestmore hard
ridesthen safe at the ranch And of course he falls madly in love with
meno you for Ill be true to my Las Vegas lover

Hush silly Bo tell me arent you SCARED

Scared Im scared stiff But if Western girls stand such things we
can No Western girl is going to beat ME

That brought Helen to a realization of the brave place she had given
herself in dreams and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly
proud of this little sister

Bo thank Heaven I brought you with me exclaimed Helen fervently
Ill eat if it chokes me

Whereupon she found herself actually hungry and while she ate she
glanced out of the stage first from one side and then from the other
These windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in
The sun had long since sunk Out to the west where a bold black
horizonline swept away endlessly the sky was clear gold shading
to yellow and blue above Stars were out pale and wan but growing
brighter The earth appeared bare and heaving like a calm sea The wind
bore a fragrance new to Helen acridly sweet and clean and it was so
cold it made her fingers numb

I heard some animal yelp said Bo suddenly and she listened with
head poised

But Helen heard nothing save the steady clipclop of hoofs the clink of
chains the creak and rattle of the old stage and occasionally the low
voices of the men above

When the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst night had settled down
black They pulled the cloaks up over them and close together leaned
back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers Helen did not have
much to say but Bo was talkative

This beats me she said once after an interval Where are we Nell
Those men up there are Mormons Maybe they are abducting us

Mr Dale isnt a Mormon replied Helen

How do you know

I could tell by the way he spoke of his friends

Well I wish it wasnt so dark Im not afraid of men in daylight
Nell did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow Whatd they call
him MiltMilt Dale He said he lived in the woods If I hadnt fallen
in love with that cowboy who called mewell Id be a goner now

After an interval of silence Bo whispered startlingly Wonder if Harve
Riggs is following us now

Of course he is replied Helen hopelessly

Hed better look out Why Nell he never sawhe neverwhat did Uncle
Al used to call itsavsavviedthats it Riggs never savvied that
hunter But I did you bet

Savvied What do you mean Bo

I mean that longhaired galoot never saw his real danger But I felt
it Something went light inside me Dale never took him seriously at
all

Riggs will turn up at Uncle Als sure as Im born said Helen

Let him turn replied Bo contemptuously Nell dont you ever bother
your head again about him Ill bet theyre all men out here And I
wouldnt be in Harve Riggss boots for a lot

After that Bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness and from that
she drifted back to the loved ones at home now seemingly at the other
side of the world and then she broke down and cried after which she
fell asleep on Helens shoulder

But Helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to

She had always since she could remember longed for a moving active
life and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies
And now it struck her grimly that if these first few hours of her
advent in the West were forecasts of the future she was destined to
have her longings more than fulfilled

Presently the stage rolled slower and slower until it came to a halt
Then the horses heaved the harnesses clinked the men whispered
Otherwise there was an intense quiet She looked out expecting to
find it pitchdark It was black yet a transparent blackness To her
surprise she could see a long way A shootingstar electrified her
The men were listening She listened too but beyond the slight sounds
about the stage she heard nothing Presently the driver clucked to his
horses and travel was resumed

For a while the stage rolled on rapidly evidently downhill swaying
from side to side and rattling as if about to fall to pieces Then it
slowed on a level and again it halted for a few moments and once more
in motion it began a laborsome climb Helen imagined miles had been
covered The desert appeared to heave into billows growing rougher and
dark round bushes dimly stood out The road grew uneven and rocky and
when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted Bo out
of her sleep and in fact almost out of Helens arms

Where am I asked Bo dazedly

Bo youre having your hearts desire but I cant tell you where you
are replied Helen

Bo awakened thoroughly which fact was now no wonder considering the
jostling of the old stage

Hold on to me Nell Is it a runaway

Weve come about a thousand miles like this I think replied Helen
Ive not a whole bone in my body

Bo peered out of the window

Oh how dark and lonesome But itd be nice if it wasnt so cold Im
freezing

I thought you loved cold air taunted Helen

Say Nell you begin to talk like yourself responded Bo

It was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak
all at once but they succeeded except in the roughest places when
from time to time they were bounced around Bo sustained a sharp rap on
the head

Oooooo she moaned Nell Rayner Ill never forgive you for fetching
me on this awful trip

Just think of your handsome Las Vegas cowboy replied Helen

Either this remark subdued Bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile
her to the hardships of the ride

Meanwhile as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep the
driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of Western men who
knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance

By and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so
long with the men whispering on top that Helen and Bo were roused to
apprehension

Suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead

Thets Roy said Joe Beeman in a low voice

I reckon An meetin us so quick looks bad replied Dale Drive on
Bill

Mebbe it seems quick to you muttered the driver but if we haint
come thirty mile an if thet ridge thar haint your turninoff place
why I dont know nothin

The stage rolled on a little farther while Helen and Bo sat clasping
each other tight wondering with bated breath what was to be the next
thing to happen

Then once more they were at a standstill Helen heard the thud of boots
striking the ground and the snorts of horses

Nell I see horses whispered Bo excitedly There to the side of
the road and here comes a man Oh if he shouldnt be the one
theyre expecting

Helen peered out to see a tall dark form moving silently and beyond
it a vague outline of horses and then pale gleams of what must have
been packloads

Dale loomed up and met the stranger in the road

Howdy Milt You got the girl sure or you wouldnt be here said a
low voice

Roy Ive got two girlssisters replied Dale

The man Roy whistled softly under his breath Then another lean rangy
form strode out of the darkness and was met by Dale

Now boyshow about Ansons gang queried Dale

At Snowdrop drinkin an quarrelin Reckon theyll leave there about
daybreak replied Roy

How long have you been here

Mebbe a couple of hours

Any horse go by

No

Roy a strange rider passed us before dark He was hittin the road
An hes got by here before you came

I dont like thet news replied Roy tersely Lets rustle With
girls on hossback youll need all the start you can get Hey John

Snake Anson shore can foller hoss tracks replied the third man

Milt say the word went on Roy as he looked up at the stars
Daylight not far away Heres the forks of the road an your hosses
an our outfit You can be in the pines by sunup

In the silence that ensued Helen heard the throb of her heart and
the panting little breaths of her sister They both peered out hands
clenched together watching and listening in strained attention

Its possible that rider last night wasnt a messenger to Anson said
Dale In that case Anson wont make anythin of our wheel tracks or
horse tracks Hell go right on to meet the regular stage Bill can you
go back an meet the stage comin before Anson does

Wal I reckon soan take it easy at thet replied Bill

All right continued Dale instantly John you an Joe an Hal ride
back to meet the regular stage An when you meet it get on an be on it
when Anson holds it up

Thets shore agreeable to me drawled John

Id like to be on it too said Roy grimly

No Ill need you till Im safe in the woods Bill hand down the bags
An you Roy help me pack them Did you get all the supplies I wanted

Shore did If the young ladies aint powerful particular you can feed
them well for a couple of months

Dale wheeled and striding to the stage he opened the door

Girls youre not asleep Come he called

Bo stepped down first

I was asleep till thisthis vehicle fell off the road back a ways
she replied

Roy Beemans low laugh was significant He took off his sombrero and
stood silent The old driver smothered a loud guffaw

Veehicle Wal Ill be doggoned Joe did you hear thet All the spunky
gurls aint born out West

As Helen followed with cloak and bag Roy assisted her and she
encountered keen eyes upon her face He seemed both gentle and
respectful and she felt his solicitude His heavy gun swinging low
struck her as she stepped down

Dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags These he
set down on the ground

Turn around Bill an go along with you John an Hal will follow
presently ordered Dale

Wal gurls said Bill looking down upon them I was shore powerful
glad to meet youall An Im ashamed of my countryofferin two sich
purty gurls insults an lowdown tricks But shore youll go through
safe now You couldnt be in better company fer ridin or huntin or
marryin or gittin religion

Shut up you old grizzly broke in Dale sharply

Haw Haw Goodby gurls an good luck ended Bill as he began to
whip the reins

Bo said goodby quite distinctly but Helen could only murmur hers The
old driver seemed a friend

Then the horses wheeled and stamped the stage careened and creaked
presently to roll out of sight in the gloom

Youre shiverin said Dale suddenly looking down upon Helen She
felt his big hard hand clasp hers Cold as ice

I am ccold replied Helen I guess were not warmly dressed

Nell we roasted all day and now were freezing declared Bo I
didnt know it was winter at night out here

Miss havent you some warm gloves an a coat asked Roy anxiously
It aint begun to get cold yet

Nell weve heavy gloves ridingsuits and bootsall fine and newin
this black bag said Bo enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet

Yes so we have But a lot of good theyll do us tonight returned
Helen

Miss youd do well to change right here said Roy earnestly Itll
save time in the long run an a lot of sufferin before sunup

Helen stared at the young man absolutely amazed with his simplicity
She was advised to change her travelingdress for a ridingsuitout
somewhere in a cold windy desertin the middle of the nightamong
strange young men

Bo which bag is it asked Dale as if she were his sister And when
she indicated the one he picked it up Come off the road

Bo followed him and Helen found herself mechanically at their heels
Dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes

Hurry an change here he said Well make a pack of your outfit an
leave room for this bag

Then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared

Bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes Helen could just see her pale
pretty face and big gleaming eyes by the light of the stars It struck
her then that Bo was going to make eminently more of a success of
Western life than she was

Nell those fellows are nnice said Bo reflectively Arent you
ccold Say he said hurry

It was beyond Helens comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out
there in that open windy desert but after she had gotten launched on
the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage The
cold wind pierced right through her Almost she could have laughed at
the way Bo made things fly

Ggggee chattered Bo I nnever wwas so cccold in all my life
Nell Rayner mmay the ggood Lord forgive yyou

Helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk She was
a strong healthy girl swift and efficient with her hands yet this
the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced almost overcame
her Bo outdistanced her by moments helped her with buttons and laced
one whole boot for her Then with hands that stung Helen packed the
travelingsuits in the bag

There But what an awful mess exclaimed Helen Oh Bo our pretty
travelingdresses

Well press them ttomorrowon a llog replied Bo and she giggled

They started for the road Bo strange to note did not carry her share
of the burden and she seemed unsteady on her feet

The men were waiting beside a group of horses one of which carried a
pack

Nothin slow about you said Dale relieving Helen of the grip Roy
put them up while I sling on this bag

Roy led out two of the horses

Get up he said indicating Bo The stirrups are short on this
saddle

Bo was an adept at mounting but she made such awkward and slow work of
it in this instance that Helen could not believe her eyes

Haw re the stirrups asked Roy Stand in them Guess theyre about
right Careful now Thet hoss is skittish Hold him in

Bo was not living up to the reputation with which Helen had credited
her

Now miss you get up said Roy to Helen And in another instant she
found herself astride a black spirited horse Numb with cold as she
was she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins

Roy was at the stirrups with swift hands

Youre taller n I guessed he said Stay up but lift your foot
Shore now Im glad you have them thick soft boots Mebbe well ride
all over the White Mountains

Bo do you hear that called Helen

But Bo did not answer She was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle
Helen became anxious Just then Dale strode back to them

All cinched up Roy

Jest ready replied Roy

Then Dale stood beside Helen How tall he was His wide shoulders seemed
on a level with the pommel of her saddle He put an affectionate hand on
the horse

His names Ranger an hes the fastest an finest horse in this
country

I reckon he shore isalong with my bay corroborated Roy

Roy if you rode Ranger hed beat your pet said Dale We can start
now Roy you drive the packhorses

He took another look at Helens saddle and then moved to do likewise
with Bos

Are youall right he asked quickly

Bo reeled in her seat

Im nnear froze she replied in a faint voice Her face shone white
in the starlight Helen recognized that Bo was more than cold

Oh Bo she called in distress

Nell dont you worry now

Let me carry you suggested Dale

No Ill ssstick on this horse or ddie fiercely retorted Bo

The two men looked up at her white face and then at each other Then Roy
walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and Dale swung
astride the one horse left

Keep close to me he said

Bo fell in line and Helen brought up the rear

Helen imagined she was near the end of a dream Presently she would
awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at
home and hear the cherry branches brushing her window and the old
clarionvoiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn



CHAPTER VI

The horses trotted And the exercise soon warmed Helen until she was
fairly comfortable except in her fingers In mind however she grew
more miserable as she more fully realized her situation The night now
became so dark that although the head of her horse was alongside the
flank of Bos she could scarcely see Bo From time to time Helens
anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right

Helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year and for several
years she had not ridden with any regularity Despite her thrills
upon mounting she had entertained misgivings But she was agreeably
surprised for the horse Ranger had an easy gait and she found she
had not forgotten how to ride Bo having been used to riding on a farm
near home might be expected to acquit herself admirably It occurred
to Helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick
comfortable riding outfits

Dark as the night was Helen could dimly make out the road underneath
It was rocky and apparently little used When Dale turned off the road
into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain the traveling
was harder rougher and yet no slower The horses kept to the gait of
the leaders Helen discovering it unnecessary ceased attempting to
guide Ranger There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead and always they
gave Helen uneasiness until closer approach proved them to be rocks
or low scrubby trees These increased in both size and number as the
horses progressed Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind
This act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread Dale
expected to be pursued And Helen experienced along with the dread
flashes of unfamiliar resentment Not only was there an attempt afoot
to rob her of her heritage but even her personal liberty Then she
shuddered at the significance of Dales words regarding her possible
abduction by this hired gang It seemed monstrous impossible Yet
manifestly it was true enough to Dale and his allies The West then in
reality was raw hard inevitable

Suddenly her horse stopped He had come up alongside Bos horse Dale
had halted ahead and apparently was listening Roy and the packtrain
were out of sight in the gloom

What is it whispered Helen

Reckon I heard a wolf replied Dale

Was that cry a wolfs asked Bo I heard It was wild

Were gettin up close to the foothills said Dale Feel how much
colder the air is

Im warm now replied Bo I guess being near froze was what ailed
me Nell how re you

Im warm too but Helen answered

If you had your choice of being here or back home snug in bedwhich
would you take asked Bo

Bo exclaimed Helen aghast

Well Id choose to be right here on this horse rejoined Bo

Dale heard her for he turned an instant then slapped his horse and
started on

Helen now rode beside Bo and for a long time they climbed steadily in
silence Helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed and she
welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east Then the stars
paled Gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars The
great white morning star wonderful as Helen had never seen it lost its
brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue

Daylight came gradually so that the gray desert became distinguishable
by degrees Rolling bare hills half obscured by the gray lifting mantle
of night rose in the foreground and behind was gray space slowly
taking form and substance In the east there was a kindling of pale
rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing
visibly rugged

Reckon wed better catch up with Roy said Dale and he spurred his
horse

Ranger and Bos mount needed no other urging and they swung into a
canter Far ahead the packanimals showed with Roy driving them The
cold wind was so keen in Helens face that tears blurred her eyes and
froze her cheeks And riding Ranger at that pace was like riding in
a rockingchair That ride invigorating and exciting seemed all too
short

Oh Nell I dont carewhat becomes ofme exclaimed Bo
breathlessly

Her face was white and red fresh as a rose her eyes glanced darkly
blue her hair blew out in bright unruly strands Helen knew she felt
some of the physical stimulation that had so roused Bo and seemed so
irresistible but somber thought was not deflected thereby

It was clear daylight when Roy led off round a knoll from which patches
of scrubby treescedars Dale called themstraggled up on the side of
the foothills

They grow on the north slopes where the snow stays longest said
Dale

They descended into a valley that looked shallow but proved to be deep
and wide and then began to climb another foothill Upon surmounting it
Helen saw the rising sun and so glorious a view confronted her that she
was unable to answer Bos wild exclamations

Bare yellow cedardotted slopes apparently level so gradual was the
ascent stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose
black over range after range at last to fail near the bare summit of a
magnificent mountain sunriseflushed against the blue sky

Oh beautiful cried Bo But they ought to be called Black
Mountains

Old Baldy there is white half the year replied Dale

Look back an see what you say suggested Roy

The girls turned to gaze silently Helen imagined she looked down upon
the whole wide world How vastly different was the desert Verily it
yawned away from her red and gold near at hand growing softly flushed
with purple far away a barren void borderless and immense where
darkgreen patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to
emphasize distance and space

See thet little green spot said Roy pointing Thets Snowdrop An
the other oneway to the rightthets Show Down

Where is Pine queried Helen eagerly

Farther still up over the foothills at the edge of the woods

Then were riding away from it

Yes If wed gone straight for Pine thet gang could overtake us Pine
is four days ride An by takin to the mountains Milt can hide his
tracks An when hes thrown Anson off the scent then hell circle down
to Pine

Mr Dale do you think youll get us there safelyand soon asked
Helen wistfully

I wont promise soon but I promise safe An I dont like bein called
Mister he replied

Are we ever going to eat inquired Bo demurely

At this query Roy Beeman turned with a laugh to look at Bo Helen saw
his face fully in the light and it was thin and hard darkly bronzed
with eyes like those of a hawk and with square chin and lean jaws
showing scant light beard

We shore are he replied Soon as we reach the timber Thet wont be
long

Reckon we can rustle some an then take a good rest said Dale and he
urged his horse into a jogtrot

During a steady trot for a long hour Helens roving eyes were
everywhere taking note of the things from near to farthe scant sage
that soon gave place to as scanty a grass and the dark blots that
proved to be dwarf cedars and the ravines opening out as if by magic
from what had appeared level ground to wind away widening between gray
stone walls and farther on patches of lonely pinetrees two and three
together and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens and up beyond
the fringed border of forest growing nearer all the while the black
sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of
the range

No birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber
which fact seemed strange to Helen The air lost something of its cold
cutting edge as the sun rose higher and it gained sweeter tang of
forestland The first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly
new to Helen yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and
with it an emotion as strange It was as if she had smelled that keen
pungent tang long ago and her physical sense caught it before her
memory

The yellow plain had only appeared to be level Roy led down into a
shallow ravine where a tiny stream meandered and he followed this
around to the left coming at length to a point where cedars and
dwarf pines formed a little grove Here as the others rode up he sat
crosslegged in his saddle and waited

Well hang up awhile he said Reckon youre tired

Im hungry but not tired yet replied Bo

Helen dismounted to find that walking was something she had apparently
lost the power to do Bo laughed at her but she too was awkward when
once more upon the ground

Then Roy got down Helen was surprised to find him lame He caught her
quick glance

A hoss threw me once an rolled on me Only broke my collarbone five
ribs one arm an my bowlegs in two places

Notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple as he stood there
tall and lithe in his homespun ragged garments he looked singularly
powerful and capable

Reckon walkin around would be good for you girls advised Dale If
you aint stiff yet youll be soon An walkin will help Dont go
far Ill call when breakfasts ready


A little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and
found campfire and meal awaiting them Roy was sitting crosslegged
like an Indian in front of a tarpaulin upon which was spread a homely
but substantial fare Helens quick eye detected a cleanliness and
thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of
men of the wilds Moreover the fare was good She ate heartily and
as for Bos appetite she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as
amused at it The young men were all eyes assiduous in their service
to the girls but speaking seldom It was not lost upon Helen how
Dales gray gaze went often down across the open country She divined
apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it

Ideclare burst out Bo when she could not eat any more this
isnt believable Im dreaming Nell the black horse you rode is the
prettiest I ever saw

Ranger with the other animals was grazing along the little brook
Packs and saddles had been removed The men ate leisurely There
was little evidence of hurried flight Yet Helen could not cast off
uneasiness Roy might have been deep and careless with a motive to
spare the girls anxiety but Dale seemed incapable of anything he did
not absolutely mean

Rest or walk he advised the girls Weve got forty miles to ride
before dark

Helen preferred to rest but Bo walked about petting the horses and
prying into the packs She was curious and eager

Dale and Roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and
packed them away in a heavy canvas bag

You really expect Anson ll strike my trail this mornin Dale was
asking

I shore do replied Roy

An how do you figure that so soon

Howd you figure itif you was Snake Anson queried Roy in reply

Depends on that rider from Magdalena Said Dale soberly Although
its likely Id seen them wheel tracks an hoss tracks made where we
turned off But supposin he does

Milt listen I told you Snake met us boys face to face day before
yesterday in Show Down An he was plumb curious

But he missed seein or hearin about me replied Dale

Mebbe he did an mebbe he didnt Anyway whats the difference whether
he finds out this mornin or this evenin

Then you aint expectin a fight if Anson holds up the stage

Wal hed have to shoot first which aint likely John an Hal since
thet shootinscrape a year ago have been sort of gunshy Joe might
get riled But I reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay An itd
be sense not to count on thet

Then you hang up here an keep watch for Ansons gangsay long enough
sos to be sure theyd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin
Makin sure one way or another you ride crosscountry to Big Spring
where Ill camp tonight

Roy nodded approval of that suggestion Then without more words both men
picked up ropes and went after the horses Helen was watching Dale so
that when Bo cried out in great excitement Helen turned to see a savage
yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing
the air Roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp

Nell look at that for a wild pony exclaimed Bo

Helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated
mustang Roy dragged him to a cedar near by

Come now Buckskin said Roy soothingly and he slowly approached the
quivering animal He went closer hand over hand on the lasso Buckskin
showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth But he stood
while Roy loosened the loop and slipping it down over his head
fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose

Thets a hackamore he said indicating the knot Hes never had a
bridle an never will have one I reckon

You dont ride him queried Helen

Sometimes I do replied Roy with a smile Would you girls like to
try him

Excuse me answered Helen

Gee ejaculated Bo He looks like a devil But Id tackle himif you
think I could

The wild leaven of the West had found quick root in Bo Rayner

Wal Im sorry but I reckon Ill not let youfor a spell replied
Roy dryly

He pitches somethin powerful bad

Pitches You mean bucks

I reckon

In the next halfhour Helen saw more and learned more about how horses
of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of Excepting
Ranger and Roys bay and the white pony Bo rode the rest of the
horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and
packed It was a job for fearless strong men and one that called for
patience as well as arms of iron So that for Helen Rayner the thing
succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect To an
observing woman that halfhour told much

When all was in readiness for a start Dale mounted and said
significantly Roy Ill look for you about sundown I hope no sooner

Wal itd be bad if I had to rustle along soon with bad news Lets
hope for the best Weve been shore lucky so far Now you take to the
pinemats in the woods an hide your trail

Dale turned away Then the girls bade Roy goodby and followed Soon
Roy and his buckskincolored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of
trees

The unhampered horses led the way the packanimals trotted after them
the riders were close behind All traveled at a jogtrot And this gait
made the packs bob up and down and from side to side The sun felt
warm at Helens back and the wind lost its frosty coldness that almost
appeared damp for a dry sweet fragrance Dale drove up the shallow
valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of
timber some few miles ahead It did not take long to reach the edge of
the forest

Helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no
farther Probably the growth had to do with snow but as the ground
was level she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just
there

They rode into the forest

To Helen it seemed a strange critical entrance into another world
which she was destined to know and to love The pines were big
brownbarked seamed and knotted with no typical conformation except
a majesty and beauty They grew far apart Few small pines and little
underbrush flourished beneath them The floor of this forest appeared
remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and
wide brown areas of pineneedles These manifestly were what Roy
had meant by pinemats Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or
rotting Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and
the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all and when
they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log Likewise
she became aware of a springy nature of the ground And then she saw
that the pinemats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the
horses and after they had passed sprang back to place again leaving no
track Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind Indeed
it would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest This
knowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen and for the first time
since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind
and heart It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have
had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances

Bo however seemed too young too wild too intense to mind what the
circumstances were She responded to reality Helen began to suspect
that the girl would welcome any adventure and Helen knew surely now
that Bo was a true Auchincloss For three long days Helen had felt a
constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar for the last
hours it had been submerged under dread But it must be she concluded
blood like her sisters pounding at her veins to be set free to race
and to burn

Bo loved action She had an eye for beauty but she was not
contemplative She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them
in rather close formation She rode well and as yet showed no symptoms
of fatigue or pain Helen began to be aware of both but not enough yet
to limit her interest

A wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her Of all living
creatures in nature Helen liked birds best and she knew many and could
imitate the songs of a few But here under the stately pines there were
no birds Squirrels however began to be seen here and there and in
the course of an hours travel became abundant The only one with which
she was familiar was the chipmunk All the others from the slim bright
blacks to the striped russets and the whitetailed grays were totally
new to her They appeared tame and curious The reds barked and scolded
at the passing cavalcade the blacks glided to some safe branch there
to watch the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their
domain

Once Dale halting his horse pointed with long arm and Helen
following the direction descried several gray deer standing in a glade
motionless with long ears up They made a wild and beautiful picture
Suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides

The forest on the whole held to the level open character but there
were swales and streambeds breaking up its regular conformity Toward
noon however it gradually changed a fact that Helen believed she
might have observed sooner had she been more keen The general lay of
the land began to ascend and the trees to grow denser

She made another discovery Ever since she had entered the forest she
had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting
her nostrils She imagined with regret that she had taken cold But
presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine
odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch
The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength
Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn

When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings
it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied
recognition Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they
grew worse One especially was a pain beyond all her experience
It lay in the muscles of her side above her hip and it grew to be a
treacherous thing for it was not persistent It came and went After it
did come with a terrible flash it could be borne by shifting or easing
the body But it gave no warning When she expected it she was mistaken
when she dared to breathe again then with piercing swiftness
it returned like a blade in her side This then was one of the
ridingpains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride It
was almost too much to be borne The beauty of the forest the living
creatures to be seen scurrying away the time distanceeverything
faded before that stablike pain To her infinite relief she found that
it was the trot that caused this torture When Ranger walked she did not
have to suffer it Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared
or until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight then she loped him ahead
until he had caught up

So the hours passed the sun got around low sending golden shafts
under the trees and the forest gradually changed to a brighter but a
thicker color This slowly darkened Sunset was not far away

She heard the horses splashing in water and soon she rode up to see the
tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss
She crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a
more open place in the forest where the pines were huge towering
and far apart A low gray bluff of stone rose to the right perhaps
onethird as high as the trees From somewhere came the rushing sound of
running water

Big Spring announced Dale We camp here You girls have done well

Another glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from
under this gray bluff

Im dying for a drink cried Bo with her customary hyperbole

I reckon youll never forget your first drink here remarked Dale

Bo essayed to dismount and finally fell off and when she did get to
the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function and she
fell flat Dale helped her up

Whats wrong with me anyhow she demanded in great amaze

Just stiff I reckon replied Dale as he led her a few awkward steps

Bo have you any hurts queried Helen who still sat her horse loath
to try dismounting yet wanting to beyond all words

Bo gave her an eloquent glance

Nell did you have one in your side like a wicked long
darningneedle punching deep when you werent ready

That one Ill never get over exclaimed Helen softly Then profiting
by Bos experience she dismounted cautiously and managed to keep
upright Her legs felt like wooden things

Presently the girls went toward the spring

Drink slow called out Dale

Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray weathered
bluff from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water
Its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold
stone

Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank seeing their faces as they bent
over and they sipped a mouthful by Dales advice and because they
were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a
precious opportunity

The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen made her teeth
ache and a singular revivifying current steal all through her
wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh irresistible
in its appeal to thirst Helen raised her head to look at this water It
was colorless as she had found it tasteless

Nelldrink panted Bo Think of ourold springin the
orchardfull of pollywogs

And then Helen drank thirstily with closed eyes while a memory of home
stirred from Bos gift of poignant speech



CHAPTER VII

The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the
horses and opening it he took out tarpaulin and blankets which he
arranged on the ground under a pinetree

You girls rest he said briefly

Cant we help asked Helen though she could scarcely stand

Youll be welcome to do all you like after youre broke in

Broke in ejaculated Bo with a little laugh Im all broke UP now

Bo it looks as if Mr Dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in
the woods

It does replied Bo as slowly she sat down upon the blankets
stretched out with a long sigh and laid her head on a saddle Nell
didnt he say not to call him Mister

Dale was throwing the packs off the other horses

Helen lay down beside Bo and then for once in her life she experienced
the sweetness of rest

Well sister what do you intend to call him queried Helen
curiously

Milt of course replied Bo

Helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches

I suppose then when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call
him what he called you

Bo blushed which was a rather unusual thing for her

I will if I like she retorted Nell ever since I could remember
youve raved about the West Now youre OUT West right in it good and
deep So wake up

That was Bos blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination
of Helens superficialities It sank deep Helen had no retort Her
ambition as far as the West was concerned had most assuredly not been
for such a wild unheardof jaunt as this But possibly the Westa
living from day to daywas one succession of adventures trials
tests troubles and achievements To make a place for others to live
comfortably some day That might be Bos meaning embodied in her
forceful hint But Helen was too tired to think it out then She found
it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale

He hobbled the horses and turned them loose Then with ax in hand he
approached a short dead tree standing among a few whitebarked
aspens Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax With his coat off
displaying his wide shoulders straight back and long powerful arms
he looked a young giant He was lithe and supple brawny but not bulky
The ax rang on the hard wood reverberating through the forest A few
strokes sufficed to bring down the stub Then he split it up Helen was
curious to see how he kindled a fire First he ripped splinters out of
the heart of the log and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground
Then from a saddlebag which hung on a nearby branch he took flint and
steel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin upon
which powder had been rubbed At any rate the first strike of the steel
brought sparks a blaze and burning splinters Instantly the flame
leaped a foot high He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise and the
fire roared

That done he stood erect and facing the north he listened Helen
remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before
since the arrival at Big Spring It was Roy for whom he was listening
and watching The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the
pines were losing their brightness

The camp utensils which the hunter emptied out of a sack gave forth a
jangle of iron and tin Next he unrolled a large pack the contents
of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes These evidently
contained food supplies The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over
it pack and all Dale filled it at the spring Upon returning to the
campfire he poured water into a washbasin and getting down to his
knees proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly The act seemed a habit
for Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods
and listened Then he dried his hands over the fire and turning to the
spreadout pack he began preparations for the meal

Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied
At Magdalena on the stageride and last night she had trusted
this stranger a hunter of the White Mountains who appeared ready to
befriend her And she had felt an exceeding gratitude Still she had
looked at him impersonally But it began to dawn upon her that chance
had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man That impression
baffled her It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind
to help a young woman in peril or that he appeared deft and quick at
campfire chores Most Western men were brave her uncle had told her
and many were roughly kind and all of them could cook This hunter was
physically a wonderful specimen of manhood with something leonine about
his stature But that did not give rise to her impression Helen
had been a schoolteacher and used to boys and she sensed a boyish
simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter She believed however
that it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to
think of it

Nell Ive spoken to you three times protested Bo petulantly What
re you mooning over

Im pretty tiredand far away Bo replied Helen What did you say

I said I had an enormous appetite

Really Thats not remarkable for you Im too tired to eat And afraid
to shut my eyes Theyd never come open When did we sleep last Bo

Second night before we left home declared Bo

Four nights Oh weve slept some

Ill bet I make mine up in this woods Do you suppose well sleep right
hereunder this treewith no covering

It looks so replied Helen dubiously

How perfectly lovely exclaimed Bo in delight Well see the stars
through the pines

Seems to be clouding over Wouldnt it be awful if we had a storm

Why I dont know answered Bo thoughtfully It must storm out
West

Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo It was something
that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St Joseph
All of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thoughta thrilling
consciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild
environment How strange and fearful perhaps to watch that growth
Bo being younger more impressionable with elemental rather than
intellectual instincts would grow stronger more swiftly Helen wondered
if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive But how could
anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way It was the
savage who did not think

Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest

Reckon Roy aint comin he soliloquized An thats good Then he
turned to the girls Suppers ready

The girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity And
they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods Dale
attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face

Tomorrow night well have meat he said

What kind asked Bo

Wild turkey or deer Maybe both if you like But its well to take
wild meat slow An turkeythat ll melt in your mouth

Uummm murmured Bo greedily Ive heard of wild turkey

When they had finished Dale ate his meal listening to the talk of the
girls and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bos It was
twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans and almost dark by the
time his duties appeared ended Then he replenished the campfire and
sat down on a log to gaze into the fire The girls leaned comfortably
propped against the saddles

Nell Ill keel over in a minute said Bo And I oughtntright on
such a big supper

I dont see how I can sleep and I know I cant stay awake rejoined
Helen

Dale lifted his head alertly

Listen

The girls grew tense and still Helen could not hear a sound unless it
was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom The forest seemed sleeping She
knew from Bos eyes wide and shining in the campfire light that she
too had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant

Bunch of coyotes comin he explained

Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy highstrung strange
barks They sounded wild yet they held something of a friendly or
inquisitive note Presently gray forms could be descried just at the
edge of the circle of light Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded
the camp and then barks and yelps broke out all around It was a
restless and sneaking pack of animals thought Helen she was glad after
the chorus ended and with a few desultory spiteful yelps the coyotes
went away

Silence again settled down If it had not been for the anxiety always
present in Helens mind she would have thought this silence sweet and
unfamiliarly beautiful

Ah Listen to that fellow spoke up Dale His voice was thrilling

Again the girls strained their ears That was not necessary for
presently clear and cold out of the silence pealed a mournful howl
long drawn strange and full and wild

Oh Whats that whispered Bo

Thats a big gray wolfa timberwolf or lofer as hes sometimes
called replied Dale Hes high on some rocky ridge back there He
scents us an he doesnt like it There he goes again Listen Ah
hes hungry

While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cryso wild that it made
her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come
over hershe kept her glance upon Dale

You love him she murmured involuntarily quite without understanding
the motive of her query

Assuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before and
it seemed to Helen as he pondered that he had never even asked it of
himself

I reckon so he replied presently

But wolves kill deer and little fawns and everything helpless in the
forest expostulated Bo

The hunter nodded his head

Why then can you love him repeated Helen

Come to think of it I reckon its because of lots of reasons
returned Dale He kills clean He eats no carrion Hes no coward He
fights He dies game An he likes to be alone

Kills clean What do you mean by that

A cougar now he mangles a deer An a silvertip when killin a
cow or colt he makes a mess of it But a wolf kills clean with sharp
snaps

What are a cougar and a silvertip

Cougar means mountainlion or panther an a silvertip is a grizzly
bear

Oh theyre all cruel exclaimed Helen shrinking

I reckon Often Ive shot wolves for relayin a deer

Whats that

Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer an while one of them
rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner wholl take
up the chase That way they run the deer down Cruel it is but nature
an no worse than snow an ice that starve deer or a fox that kills
turkeychicks breakin out of the egg or ravens that pick the eyes out
of newborn lambs an wait till they die An for that matter men are
crueler than beasts of prey for men add to nature an have more than
instincts

Helen was silenced as well as shocked She had not only learned a new
and striking viewpoint in natural history but a clear intimation to the
reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in
this man A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur for their
meat or horns or for some lust for bloodthat was Helens definition
of a hunter and she believed it was held by the majority of people
living in settled states But the majority might be wrong A hunter
might be vastly different and vastly more than a tracker and slayer
of game The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men
Perhaps Dale knew its secrets its life its terror its beauty its
sadness and its joy and if so how full how wonderful must be his
mind He spoke of men as no better than wolves Could a lonely life
in the wilderness teach a man that Bitterness envy jealousy spite
greed and hatethese had no place in this hunters heart It was not
Helens shrewdness but a womans intuition which divined that

Dale rose to his feet and turning his ear to the north listened once
more

Are you expecting Roy still inquired Helen

No it aint likely hell turn up tonight replied Dale and then he
strode over to put a hand on the pinetree that soared above where the
girls lay His action and the way he looked up at the treetop and then
at adjacent trees held more of that significance which so interested
Helen

I reckon hes stood there some five hundred years an will stand
through tonight muttered Dale

This pine was the monarch of that widespread group

Listen again said Dale

Bo was asleep And Helen listening at once caught low distant roar

Wind Its goin to storm explained Dale Youll hear somethin
worth while But dont be scared Reckon well be safe Pines blow down
often But this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was Better
slip under the blankets so I can pull the tarp up

Helen slid down just as she was fully dressed except for boots which
she and Bo had removed and she laid her head close to Bos Dale pulled
the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads

When it rains youll wake an then just pull the tarp up over you he
said

Will it rain Helen asked But she was thinking that this moment
was the strangest that had ever happened to her By the light of the
campfire she saw Dales face just as usual still darkly serene
expressing no thought He was kind but he was not thinking of these
sisters as girls alone with him in a pitchblack forest helpless and
defenseless He did not seem to be thinking at all But Helen had never
before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience

Ill be close by an keep the fire goin all night he said

She heard him stride off into the darkness Presently there came a
dragging bumping sound then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire
A cloud of sparks shot up and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp
ground Smoke again curled upward along the great seamed treetrunk
and flames sputtered and crackled

Helen listened again for the roar of wind It seemed to come on a breath
of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bos curls and it was
stronger But it died out presently only to come again and still
stronger Helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching
storm Her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open and she knew if
she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep And she wanted to
hear the stormwind in the pines

A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face thrilling her with the
proof that no roof stood between her and the elements Then a breeze
bore the smell of burnt wood into her face and somehow her quick mind
flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little
brothers The memory faded The roar that had seemed distant was now
back in the forest coming swiftly increasing in volume Like a
stream in flood it bore down Helen grew amazed startled How rushing
oncoming and heavy this stormwind She likened its approach to the
tread of an army Then the roar filled the forest yet it was back there
behind her Not a pineneedle quivered in the light of the campfire
But the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge The roar
augmented till it was no longer a roar but an onsweeping crash like
an ocean torrent engulfing the earth Bo awoke to cling to Helen
with fright The deafening stormblast was upon them Helen felt the
saddlepillow move under her head The giant pine had trembled to its
very roots That mighty fury of wind was all aloft in the treetops
And for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power
Then the deafening crash passed to roar and that swept on and on
lessening in volume deepening in low detonation at last to die in the
distance

No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and
ceased and rose again Helen lay there whispering to Bo and heard
again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease That was the way
of this stormwind of the mountain forest

A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dales
directions and pulling up the heavy covering she arranged it hoodlike
over the saddle Then with Bo close and warm beside her she closed
her eyes and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain
faded Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the
tarpaulin


When she opened her eyes she remembered everything as if only a moment
had elapsed But it was daylight though gray and cloudy The pines were
dripping mist A fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and
a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air Horses were standing
near by biting and kicking at one another Bo was sound asleep Dale
appeared busy around the campfire As Helen watched the hunter she
saw him pause in his task turn his ear to listen and then look
expectantly And at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest
Helen recognized Roys voice Then she heard a splashing of water and
hoofbeats coming closer With that the buckskin mustang trotted into
camp carrying Roy

Bad mornin for ducks but good for us he called

Howdy Roy greeted Dale and his gladness was unmistakable I was
lookin for you

Roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort and his swift
hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled Buckskin was wet with sweat
and foam mixed with rain He heaved And steam rose from him

Must have rode hard observed Dale

I shore did replied Roy Then he espied Helen who had sat up with
hands to her hair and eyes staring at him

Mornin miss Its good news

Thank Heaven murmured Helen and then she shook Bo That young lady
awoke but was loath to give up slumber Bo Bo Wake up Mr Roy is
back

Whereupon Bo sat up disheveled and sleepyeyed

Ohh but I ache she moaned But her eyes took in the camp scene to
the effect that she added Is breakfast ready

Almost An flapjacks this mornin replied Dale

Bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she
laced her boots Helen got their travelingbag and with this they
repaired to a flat stone beside the spring not however out of earshot
of the men

How long are you goin to hang around camp before tellin me inquired
Dale

Jest as I figgered Milt replied Roy Thet rider who passed you was
a messenger to Anson He an his gang got on our trail quick About ten
oclock I seen them comin Then I lit out for the woods I stayed off
in the woods close enough to see where they come in An shore they
lost your trail Then they spread through the woods workin off to the
south thinkin of course thet you would circle round to Pine on the
south side of Old Baldy There aint a hosstracker in Snake Ansons
gang thets shore Wal I follered them for an hour till theyd rustled
some miles off our trail Then I went back to where you struck into
the woods An I waited there all afternoon till dark expectin mebbe
theyd backtrail But they didnt I rode on a ways an camped in the
woods till jest before daylight

So far so good declared Dale

Shore Theres rough country south of Baldy an along the two or three
trails Anson an his outfit will camp you bet

It aint to be thought of muttered Dale at some idea that had struck
him

What aint

Goin round the north side of Baldy

It shore aint rejoined Roy bluntly

Then Ive got to hide tracks certainrustle to my camp an stay there
till you say its safe to risk takin the girls to Pine

Milt youre talkin the wisdom of the prophets

I aint so sure we can hide tracks altogether If Anson had any eyes
for the woods hed not have lost me so soon

No But you see hes figgerin to cross your trail

If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an hide tracks
certain Id feel safe from pursuit anyway said the hunter
reflectively

Shore an easy responded Roy quickly I jest met up with some
greaser sheepherders drivin a big flock Theyve come up from the
south an are goin to fatten up at Turkey Senacas Then theyll drive
back south an go on to Phenix Wal its muddy weather Now you break
camp quick an make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail as if you
was travelin south But instead you ride round ahead of thet flock of
sheep Theyll keep to the open parks an the trails through them necks
of woods out here An passin over your tracks theyll hide em

But supposin Anson circles an hits this camp Hell track me easy out
to that sheep trail What then

Jest what you want Goin south thet sheep trail is downhill an muddy
Its goin to rain hard Your tracks would get washed out even if you
did go south An Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the
scent Leave it to me Milt Youre a hunter But Im a hosstracker

All right Well rustle

Then he called the girls to hurry



CHAPTER VIII

Once astride the horse again Helen had to congratulate herself upon not
being so crippled as she had imagined Indeed Bo made all the audible
complaints

Both girls had long waterproof coats brandnew and of which they were
considerably proud New clothes had not been a common event in their
lives

Reckon Ill have to slit these Dale had said whipping out a huge
knife

What for had been Bos feeble protest

They wasnt made for ridin An youll get wet enough even if I do cut
them An if I dont youll get soaked

Go ahead had been Helens reluctant permission

So their long new coats were slit halfway up the back The exigency of
the case was manifest to Helen when she saw how they came down over the
cantles of the saddles and to their boottops

The morning was gray and cold A fine misty rain fell and the trees
dripped steadily Helen was surprised to see the open country again and
that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while The
country was wide and flat on the right and to the left it rolled and
heaved along a black scalloped timberline Above this bordering of
the forest low drifting clouds obscured the mountains The wind was at
Helens back and seemed to be growing stronger Dale and Roy were ahead
traveling at a good trot with the packanimals bunched before them
Helen and Bo had enough to do to keep up

The first hours ride brought little change in weather or scenery but
it gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up
all day She began to welcome the places where the horses walked but
she disliked the levels As for the descents she hated those Ranger
would not go down slowly and the shakeup she received was unpleasant
Moreover the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and
washes He sailed over them like a bird Helen could not acquire the
knack of sitting the saddle properly and so not only was her person
bruised on these occasions but her feelings were hurt Helen had
never before been conscious of vanity Still she had never rejoiced
in looking at a disadvantage and her exhibitions here must have been
frightful Bo always would forge to the front and she seldom looked
back for which Helen was grateful

Before long they struck into a broad muddy belt full of innumerable
small hoof tracks This then was the sheep trail Roy had advised
following They rode on it for three or four miles and at length
coming to a graygreen valley they saw a huge flock of sheep Soon the
air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep and a
low soft roar of pattering hoofs The flock held a compact formation
covering several acres and grazed along rapidly There were three
herders on horses and several packburros Dale engaged one of the
Mexicans in conversation and passed something to him then pointed
northward and down along the trail The Mexican grinned from ear to ear
and Helen caught the quick SI SENOR GRACIAS SENOR It was a pretty
sight that flock of sheep as it rolled along like a rounded woolly
stream of grays and browns and here and there a black They were keeping
to a trail over the flats Dale headed into this trail and if anything
trotted a little faster

Presently the clouds lifted and broke showing blue sky and one streak
of sunshine But the augury was without warrant The wind increased A
huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that
could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a
swiftly moving wall Soon it enveloped the fugitives

With head bowed Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold gray
rain that blew almost on a level Finally the heavy downpour passed
leaving a fine mist The clouds scurried low and dark hiding the
mountains altogether and making the gray wet plain a dreary sight
Helens feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water And
they were cold Her gloves too had not been intended for rain and
they were wet through The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to
beat her hands together Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was
to trot faster which event was worse for Helen than freezing

She saw another black scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its
trailing sheets of rain and this one appeared streaked with white
Snow The wind was now piercingly cold Helens body kept warm but
her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly She gazed ahead
grimly There was no help she had to go on Dale and Roy were hunched
down in their saddles probably wet through for they wore no rainproof
coats Bo kept close behind them and plain it was that she felt the
cold

This second storm was not so bad as the first because there was less
rain Still the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow It lasted
for an hour during which the horses trotted on trotted on Again the
gray torrent roared away the fine mist blew the clouds lifted and
separated and closing again darkened for another onslaught This one
brought sleet The driving pellets stung Helens neck and cheeks and
for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was
afraid she could not hold up under them The bare places on the ground
showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice

Thus storm after storm rolled over Helens head Her feet grew numb
and ceased to hurt But her fingers because of her ceaseless efforts
to keep up the circulation retained the stinging pain And now the wind
pierced right through her She marveled at her endurance and there were
many times that she believed she could not ride farther Yet she kept
on All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as
this Hard and cold wet and windy at an increasing elevationthat was
the explanation The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood

Still during all those interminable hours Helen watched where she was
traveling and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize
it The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into
an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats They rode
along its margin splashing up to the knees of the horses Cranes and
herons flew on with lumbering motion flocks of ducks winged swift
flight from one side to the other Beyond this depression the land
sloped rather abruptly outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of
the highest ground and again a dark fringe of trees appeared

How many miles wondered Helen They seemed as many and as long as
the hours But at last just as another hard rain came the pines
were reached They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little
protection from the storm

Helen sat her saddle a dead weight Whenever Ranger quickened his gait
or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling
off Her mind harbored only sensations of misery and a persistent
thoughtwhy did she ever leave home for the West Her solicitude for Bo
had been forgotten Nevertheless any marked change in the topography
of the country was registered perhaps photographed on her memory by the
torturing vividness of her experience

The forest grew more level and denser Shadows of twilight or gloom lay
under the trees Presently Dale and Roy disappeared going downhill
and likewise Bo Then Helens ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid
water Ranger trotted faster Soon Helen came to the edge of a great
valley black and gray so full of obscurity that she could not see
across or down into it But she knew there was a rushing river at
the bottom The sound was deep continuous a heavy murmuring roar
singularly musical The trail was steep Helen had not lost all feeling
as she had believed and hoped Her poor mistreated body still responded
excruciatingly to concussions jars wrenches and all the other
horrible movements making up a horsetrot

For long Helen did not look up When she did so there lay a green
willowbordered treeless space at the bottom of the valley through
which a brownwhite stream rushed with steady earfilling roar

Dale and Roy drove the packanimals across the stream and followed
going deep to the flanks of their horses Bo rode into the foaming water
as if she had been used to it all her days A slip a fall would have
meant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent

Ranger trotted straight to the edge and there obedient to Helens
clutch on the bridle he halted The stream was fifty feet wide shallow
on the near side deep on the opposite with fast current and big waves
Helen was simply too frightened to follow

Let him come yelled Dale Stick on now Ranger

The big black plunged in making the water fly That stream was nothing
for him though it seemed impassable to Helen She had not the strength
left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them Ranger in two
more plunges surmounted the bank and then trotting across the green
to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines he gave a
great heave and halted

Roy reached up to help her off

Thirty miles Miss Helen he said and the way he spoke was a
compliment

He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned Dale
had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddleblankets on the ground
under the pine

Nellyou sworeyou loved me was Bos mournful greeting The girl
was pale drawn bluelipped and she could not stand up

Bo I never didor Id never have brought you to thiswretch that I
am cried Helen Oh what a horrible ride

Rain was falling the trees were dripping the sky was lowering All the
ground was soaking wet with pools and puddles everywhere Helen could
imagine nothing but a heartless dreary cold prospect Just then home
was vivid and poignant in her thoughts Indeed so utterly miserable
was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down of a cessation of
movement of a release from that infernal perpetualtrotting horse
seemed only a mockery It could not be true that the time had come for
rest

Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheepherders
for there were remains of a fire Dale lifted the burnt end of a log
and brought it down hard upon the ground splitting off pieces Several
times he did this It was amazing to see his strength his facility as
he split off handfuls of splinters He collected a bundle of them and
laying them down he bent over them Roy wielded the ax on another log
and each stroke split off a long strip Then a tiny column of smoke
drifted up over Dales shoulder as he leaned bareheaded sheltering the
splinters with his hat A blaze leaped up Roy came with an armful of
strips all white and dry out of the inside of a log Crosswise these
were laid over the blaze and it began to roar Then piece by piece the
men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods branches
and stumps and logs erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke
roared upward It had not taken two minutes Already Helen felt the
warmth on her icy face She held up her bare numb hands

Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin yet they did not tarry
beside the fire They relieved the horses A lasso went up between two
pines and a tarpaulin over it Vshaped and pegged down at the four
ends The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and
bedding were placed under this shelter

Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more In this short
space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot
Rain was falling steadily all around but over and near that roaring
blaze ten feet high no water fell It evaporated The ground began to
steam and to dry Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out
the cold But presently the pain ceased

Nell I never knew before how good a fire could feel declared Bo

And therein lay more food for Helens reflection

In ten minutes Helen was dry and hot Darkness came down upon the
dreary sodden forest but that great campfire made it a different
world from the one Helen had anticipated It blazed and roared cracked
like a pistol hissed and sputtered shot sparks everywhere and sent
aloft a dense yellow whirling column of smoke It began to have a
heart of gold

Dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the
coffeepot and oven soon began to steam

Roy I promised the girls turkey tonight said the hunter

Mebbe tomorrow if the wind shifts This s turkey country

Roy a potato will do me exclaimed Bo Never again will I ask for
cake and pie I never appreciated good things to eat And Ive been a
little pig always I nevernever knew what it was to be hungryuntil
now

Dale glanced up quickly

Lass its worth learnin he said

Helens thought was too deep for words In such brief space had she been
transformed from misery to comfort

The rain kept on falling though it appeared to grow softer as night
settled down black The wind died away and the forest was still except
for the steady roar of the stream A folded tarpaulin was laid between
the pine and the fire well in the light and warmth and upon it the
men set steaming pots and plates and cups the fragrance from which was
strong and inviting

Fetch the saddleblanket an set with your backs to the fire said
Roy


Later when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and
sheltered from the rain Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen
asleep The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day She
could see the smoke the trunk of the big pine towering aloft and
a blank space of sky The stream hummed a song seemingly musical at
times and then discordant and dull now low now roaring and always
rushing gurgling babbling flowing chafing in its hurry

Presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses
and beside the fire they conversed in low tones

Wal thet trail we made today will be hid I reckon said Roy with
satisfaction

What wasnt sheeped over would be washed out Weve had luck An now I
aint worryin returned Dale

Worryin Then its the first I ever knowed you to do

Man I never had a job like this protested the hunter

Wal thets so

Now Roy when old Al Auchincloss finds out about this deal as hes
bound to when you or the boys get back to Pine hes goin to roar

Do you reckon folks will side with him against Beasley

Some of them But Al like as not will tell folks to go where its
hot Hell bunch his men an strike for the mountains to find his
nieces

Wal all youve got to do is to keep the girls hid till I can guide him
up to your camp Or failin thet till you can slip the girls down to
Pine

No one but you an your brothers ever seen my senaca But it could be
found easy enough

Anson might blunder on it But thet aint likely

Why aint it

Because Ill stick to thet sheepthiefs tracks like a wolf after a
bleedin deer An if he ever gets near your camp Ill ride in ahead of
him

Good declared Dale I was calculatin youd go down to Pine sooner
or later

Not unless Anson goes I told John thet in case there was no fight on
the stage to make a beeline back to Pine He was to tell Al an offer
his services along with Joe an Hal

One way or another then theres bound to be blood spilled over this

Shore An high time I jest hope I get a look down my old fortyfour
at thet Beasley

In that case I hope you hold straighter than times Ive seen you

Milt Dale Im a good shot declared Roy stoutly

Youre no good on movin targets

Wal mebbe so But Im not lookin for a movin target when I meet up
with Beasley Im a hossman not a hunter Youre used to shootin flies
off deers horns jest for practice

Roy can we make my camp by tomorrow night queried Dale more
seriously

We will if each of us has to carry one of the girls But theyll do it
or die Dale did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid Bo

Me Whered I ever see any girls ejaculated Dale I remember some
when I was a boy but I was only fourteen then Never had much use for
girls

Id like to have a wife like that Bo declared Roy fervidly

There ensued a moments silence

Roy youre a Mormon an you already got a wife was Dales reply

Now Milt have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of
a Mormon with two wives returned Roy and then he laughed heartily

I never could stomach what I did hear pertainin to more than one wife
for a man

Wal my friend you go an get yourself ONE An see then if you
wouldnt like to have TWO

I reckon one d be more than enough for Milt Dale

Milt old man let me tell you thet I always envied you your freedom
said Roy earnestly But it aint life

You mean life is love of a woman

No Thets only part I mean a sona boy thets like youthet you
feel will go on with your life after youre gone

Ive thought of thatthought it all out watchin the birds an
animals mate in the woods If I have no son Ill never live
hereafter

Wal replied Roy hesitatingly I dont go in so deep as thet I mean
a son goes on with your blood an your work

Exactly An Roy I envy you what you ve got because its out of
all bounds for Milt Dale

Those words sad and deep ended the conversation Again the rumbling
rushing stream dominated the forest An owl hooted dismally A horse
trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of
teeth on grass


A voice pierced Helens deep dreams and awaking she found Bo shaking
and calling her

Are you dead came the gay voice

Almost Oh my backs broken replied Helen The desire to move seemed
clamped in a vise and even if that came she believed the effort would
be impossible

Roy called us said Bo He said hurry I thought Id die just sitting
up and Id give you a million dollars to lace my boots Wait sister
till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots

With heroic and violent spirit Helen sat up to find that in the act
her aches and pains appeared beyond number Reaching for her boots
she found them cold and stiff Helen unlaced one and opening it wide
essayed to get her sore foot down into it But her foot appeared swollen
and the boot appeared shrunken She could not get it half on though
she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms She
groaned

Bo laughed wickedly Her hair was tousled her eyes dancing her cheeks
red

Be game she said Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your
boot on

Whether Bos scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to
Helen but the fact was that she got into her boots Walking and
moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired
feeling The water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than
any ice Helen had ever felt It almost paralyzed her hands Bo mumbled
and blew like a porpoise They had to run to the fire before being able
to comb their hair The air was wonderfully keen The dawn was clear
bright with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise

All ready girls called Roy Reckon you can help yourselves Milt
aint comin in very fast with the hosses Ill rustle off to help him
Weve got a hard day before us Yesterday wasnt nowhere to what today
ll be

But the suns going to shine implored Bo

Wal you bet rejoined Roy as he strode off

Helen and Bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps
half an hour then the horses came thudding down with Dale and Roy
riding bareback

By the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up melting the
frost and ice so that a dazzling bright mist full of rainbows shone
under the trees

Dale looked Ranger over and tried the cinches of Bos horse

Whats your choicea long ride behind the packs with meor a short
cut over the hills with Roy he asked

I choose the lesser of two rides replied Helen smiling

Reckon that ll be easier but youll know youve had a ride said
Dale significantly

What was that we had yesterday asked Bo archly

Only thirty miles but cold an wet Today will be fine for ridin

Milt Ill take a blanket an some grub in case you dont meet us
tonight said Roy An I reckon well split up here where Ill have
to strike out on thet short cut

Bo mounted without a helping hand but Helens limbs were so stiff that
she could not get astride the high Ranger without assistance The hunter
headed up the slope of the canyon which on that side was not steep
It was brown pine forest with here and there a clump of dark
silverpointed evergreens that Roy called spruce By the time this slope
was surmounted Helens aches were not so bad The saddle appeared to
fit her better and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar She
reflected however that she always had done pretty well uphill Here it
was beautiful forestland uneven and wilder They rode for a time along
the rim with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below with
its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear

Dale reined in and peered down at the pinemat

Fresh deer sign all along here he said pointing

Wal I seen thet long ago rejoined Roy

Helens scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in
the pineneedles dark in color and sharply defined

We may never get a better chance said Dale Those deer are workin
up our way Get your rifle out

Travel was resumed then with Roy a little in advance of the packtrain
Presently he dismounted threw his bridle and cautiously peered ahead
Then turning he waved his sombrero The packanimals halted in a
bunch Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to Roys horse
This point Helen saw was at the top of an intersecting canuon Dale
dismounted without drawing his rifle from its saddlesheath and
approached Roy

Buck an two does he said lowvoiced An theyve winded us but
dont see us yet Girls ride up closer

Following the directions indicated by Dales long arm Helen looked down
the slope It was open with tall pines here and there and clumps of
silver spruce and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight
Presently Bo exclaimed Oh look I see I see Then Helens roving
glance passed something different from green and gold and brown
Shifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag with noble spreading
antlers standing like a statue his head up in alert and wild posture
His color was gray Beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more
graceful build without horns

Its downhill whispered Dale An youre goin to overshoot

Then Helen saw that Roy had his rifle leveled

Oh dont she cried

Dales remark evidently nettled Roy He lowered the rifle

Milt its me lookin over this gun How can you stand there an tell
me Im goin to shoot high I had a dead bead on him

Roy you didnt allow for downhill Hurry He sees us now

Roy leveled the rifle and taking aim as before he fired The buck
stood perfectly motionless as if he had indeed been stone The does
however jumped with a start and gazed in fright in every direction

Told you I seen where your bullet hit thet pinehalf a foot over his
shoulder Try again an aim at his legs

Roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger A puff of dust right at
the feet of the buck showed where Roys lead had struck this time With
a single bound wonderful to see the big deer was out of sight behind
trees and brush The does leaped after him

Doggone the luck ejaculated Roy red in the face as he worked the
lever of his rifle Never could shoot downhill nohow

His rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from
Bo

Not for worlds would I have had you kill that beautiful deer she
exclaimed

We wont have venison steak off him thats certain remarked Dale
dryly An maybe none off any deer if Roy does the shootin

They resumed travel sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge
of the intersecting canuon At length they rode down to the bottom
where a tiny brook babbled through willows and they followed this for
a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream A dim trail
overgrown with grass showed at this point

Heres where we part said Dale Youll beat me into my camp but
Ill get there sometime after dark

Hey Milt I forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an the rest
of your menagerie Reckon they wont scare the girls Especially old
Tom

You wont see Tom till I get home replied Dale

Aint he corralled or tied up

No He has the run of the place

Wal goodby then an rustle along

Dale nodded to the girls and turning his horse he drove the
packtrain before him up the open space between the stream and the
wooded slope

Roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a
feat to Helen

Guess Id better cinch up he said as he threw a stirrup up over the
pommel of his saddle You girls are goin to see wild country

Whos old Tom queried Bo curiously

Why hes Milts pet cougar

Cougar Thats a panthera mountainlion didnt he say

Shore is Tom is a beauty An if he takes a likin to you hell love
you play with you maul you half to death

Bo was all eyes

Dale has other pets too she questioned eagerly

I never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an
squirrels an vermin of all kinds as tame as tame as cows Too darn
tame Milt says But I cant figger thet You girls will never want to
leave thet senaca of his

Whats a senaca asked Helen as she shifted her foot to let him
tighten the cinches on her saddle

Thets Mexican for park I guess he replied These mountains are
full of parks an say I dont ever want to see no prettier place till
I get to heaven There Ranger old boy thets tight

He slapped the horse affectionately and turning to his own he stepped
and swung his long length up

It aint deep crossin here Come on he called and spurred his bay

The stream here was wide and it looked deep but turned out to be
deceptive

Wal girls here beginneth the second lesson he drawled cheerily
Ride one behind the otherstick close to medo what I doan holler
when you want to rest or if somethin goes bad

With that he spurred into the thicket Bo went next and Helen followed
The willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch Roy and
the result was that a lowsweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard
on the head It hurt and startled her and roused her mettle Roy was
keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well and he led up
a slope to the open pine forest Here the ride for several miles was
straight level and open Helen liked the forest today It was brown
and green with patches of gold where the sun struck She saw her first
birdbig blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse and little
checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing Several times
Roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle and often
when he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see

Helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of
yesterday So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places
and aching bones These she would bear with She loved the wild and the
beautiful both of which increased manifestly with every mile The sun
was warm the air fragrant and cool the sky blue as azure and so deep
that she imagined that she could look far up into it

Suddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short

Look he called sharply

Bo screamed

Not thet way Here Aw hes gone

Nell It was a bear I saw it Oh not like circus bears at all cried
Bo

Helen had missed her opportunity

Reckon he was a grizzly an Im jest as well pleased thet he loped
off said Roy Altering his course somewhat he led to an old rotten
log that the bear had been digging in After grubs There see his
track He was a whopper shore enough

They rode on out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range
gorge and ridge green and black as far as Helen could see The ranges
were bold and long climbing to the central uplift where a number of
fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy
Far as vision could see to the right lay one rolling forest of pine
beautiful and serene Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert
but it was not in sight

I see turkeys way down there said Roy backing away Well go down
and around an mebbe Ill get a shot

Descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush This slope
consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and
many oaks Helen was delighted to see the familiar trees although these
were different from Missouri oaks Rugged and gnarled but not tall
these trees spread wide branches the leaves of which were yellowing
Roy led into a grassy glade and leaping off his horse rifle in hand
he prepared to shoot at something Again Bo cried out but this time it
was in delight Then Helen saw an immense flock of turkeys apparently
like the turkeys she knew at home but these had bronze and checks
of white and they looked wild There must have been a hundred in the
flock most of them hens A few gobblers on the far side began the
flight running swiftly off Helen plainly heard the thud of their
feet Roy shot oncetwicethree times Then rose a great commotion and
thumping and a loud roar of many wings Dust and leaves whirling in the
air were left where the turkeys had been

Wal I got two said Roy and he strode forward to pick up his game
Returning he tied two shiny plump gobblers back of his saddle and
remounted his horse Well have turkey tonight if Milt gets to camp
in time

The ride was resumed Helen never would have tired riding through those
oak groves brown and sear and yellow with leaves and acorns falling

Bears have been workin in here already said Roy I see tracks all
over They eat acorns in the fall An mebbe well run into one yet

The farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees so that
dodging branches was no light task Ranger did not seem to care how
close he passed a tree or under a limb so that he missed them himself
but Helen thereby got some additional bruises Particularly hard was it
when passing a tree to get her knee out of the way in time

Roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation
and in places covered with a thick scum But it had a current and an
outlet proving it to be a huge spring Roy pointed down at a muddy
place

Bearwallow He heard us comin Look at thet little track Cub track
An look at these scratches on this tree higher n my head An old
shebear stood up an scratched them

Roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree

Woodss full of big bears he said grinning An I take it
particular kind of this old she rustlin off with her cub Shebears
with cubs are dangerous

The next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom
of this canuon Beechtrees maples aspens overtopped by lofty
pines made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown
swirling current and leaves drifted down and stray flecks of golden
sunlight lightened the gloom Here was hard riding to and fro across the
brook between huge mossy boulders and between aspens so close together
that Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through

Once more Roy climbed out of that canuon over a ridge into another
down long wooded slopes and through scruboak thickets on and on
till the sun stood straight overhead Then he halted for a short rest
unsaddled the horses to let them roll and gave the girls some cold
lunch that he had packed He strolled off with his gun and upon
returning resaddled and gave the word to start

That was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls The forest
that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines
so steep of slope as to make precarious travel Mostly he kept to the
bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail But it was necessary
to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed and this
crossing was work

The locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close
knit They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders Ranger
appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less
Bos white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place On
the other hand some of these steep slopes were comparatively free of
underbrush Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides The earth was
soft and the hoofs sank deep Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger
would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches This
mode facilitated travel but it frightened Helen The climb out then on
the other side had to be done on foot

After half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helens strength was
spent and her breath was gone She felt lightheaded She could not get
enough air Her feet felt like lead and her ridingcoat was a burden
A hundred times hot and wet and throbbing she was compelled to stop
Always she had been a splendid walker and climber And here to break up
the long ride she was glad to be on her feet But she could only drag
one foot up after the other Then when her nose began to bleed she
realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble
Her heart however did not hurt her though she was conscious of an
oppression on her breast

At last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest
verdure that it appeared impossible to cross Nevertheless he started
down dismounting after a little way Helen found that leading Ranger
down was worse than riding him He came fast and he would step right
in her tracks She was not quick enough to get away from him Twice
he stepped on her foot and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and
threw her flat When he began to slide near the bottom Helen had to
run for her life

Oh Nell Isntthisgreat panted Bo from somewhere ahead

Boyourmindsgone panted Helen in reply

Roy tried several places to climb out and failed in each Leading down
the ravine for a hundred yards or more he essayed another attempt
Here there had been a slide and in part the earth was bare When he had
worked up this he halted above and called

Bad place Keep on the up side of the hosses

This appeared easier said than done Helen could not watch Bo because
Ranger would not wait He pulled at the bridle and snorted

Faster you come the better called Roy

Helen could not see the sense of that but she tried Roy and Bo had dug
a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide Helen made the mistake
of starting to follow in their tracks and when she realized this Ranger
was climbing fast almost dragging her and it was too late to get
above Helen began to labor She slid down right in front of Ranger The
intelligent animal with a snort plunged out of the trail to keep from
stepping on her Then he was above her

Lookout down there yelled Roy in warning Get on the up side

But that did not appear possible The earth began to slide under Ranger
and that impeded Helens progress He got in advance of her straining
on the bridle

Let go yelled Roy

Helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with
Ranger He snorted fiercely and rearing high in a mighty plunge he
gained solid ground Helen was buried to her knees but extricating
herself she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther

Bad cavein thet was Roys comment when at last she joined him and
Bo at the top

Roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go He rode to high ground and
looked in all directions To Helen one way appeared as wild and rough
as another and all was yellow green and black under the westering
sun Roy rode a short distance in one direction then changed for
another

Presently he stopped

Wal Im shore turned round he said

Youre not lost cried Bo

Reckon Ive been thet for a couple of hours he replied cheerfully
Never did ride across here I had the direction but Im blamed now if I
can tell which way thet was

Helen gazed at him in consternation

Lost she echoed



CHAPTER IX

A silence ensued fraught with poignant fear for Helen as she gazed
into Bos whitening face She read her sisters mind Bo was remembering
tales of lost people who never were found

Me an Milt get lost every day said Roy You dont suppose any man
can know all this big country Its nothin for us to be lost

Oh I was lost when I was little said Bo

Wal I reckon itd been better not to tell you so offhand like
replied Roy contritely Dont feel bad now All I need is a peek at
Old Baldy Then Ill have my bearin Come on

Helens confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot He rode
toward the westering sun keeping to the ridge they had ascended until
once more he came out upon a promontory Old Baldy loomed there blacker
and higher and closer The dark forest showed round yellow bare spots
like parks

Not so far off the track said Roy as he wheeled his horse Well
make camp in Milts senaca tonight

He led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude
where the character of the forest changed The trees were no longer
pines but firs and spruce growing thin and exceedingly tall with
few branches below the topmost foliage So dense was this forest that
twilight seemed to have come

Travel was arduous Everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided
and not a rod was there without a fallen tree The horses laboring
slowly sometimes sank kneedeep into the brown duff Gray moss
festooned the treetrunks and an ambergreen moss grew thick on the
rotting logs

Helen loved this forest primeval It was so still so dark so gloomy
so full of shadows and shade and a dank smell of rotting wood and
sweet fragrance of spruce The great windfalls where trees were jammed
together in dozens showed the savagery of the storms Wherever a single
monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons
jealous of one another fighting for place Even the trees fought one
another The forest was a place of mystery but its strife could be read
by any eye The lightnings had split firs clear to the roots and others
it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk

Time came however when the exceeding wildness of the forest in
density and fallen timber made it imperative for Helen to put all her
attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity So the
pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her
Thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless

Roy led on and Ranger followed while the shadows darkened under the
trees She was reeling in her saddle half blind and sick when Roy
called out cheerily that they were almost there

Whatever his idea was to Helen it seemed many miles that she followed
him farther out of the heavytimbered forest down upon slopes of low
spruce like evergreen which descended sharply to another level where
dark shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low
murmur of falling water and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful
park full of a thick rich golden light of fastfading sunset

Smell the smoke said Roy By Solomon if Milt aint here ahead of
me

He rode on Helens weary gaze took in the round senaca the circling
black slopes leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the
last flare of the sun then all the spirit left in her flashed up in
thrilling wonder at this exquisite wild and colorful spot

Horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing
with them Roy led round a corner of the fringed bordering woodland
and there under lofty trees shone a campfire Huge gray rocks loomed
beyond and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain
wall over which poured a thin lacy waterfall As Helen gazed in
rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the
amphitheater darkened

Dales tall form appeared

Reckon youre late he said as with a comprehensive flash of eye he
took in the three

Milt I got lost replied Roy

I feared as much You girls look like youd done better to ride with
me went on Dale as he offered a hand to help Bo off She took it
tried to get her foot out of the stirrups and then she slid from the
saddle into Dales arms He placed her on her feet and supporting her
said solicitously A hundredmile ride in three days for a tenderfoot
is somethin your uncle Al wont believe Come walk if it kills
you

Whereupon he led Bo very much as if he were teaching a child to walk
The fact that the voluble Bo had nothing to say was significant to
Helen who was following with the assistance of Roy

One of the huge rocks resembled a seashell in that it contained a
hollow over which the widespreading shelf flared out It reached toward
branches of great pines A spring burst from a crack in the solid rock
The campfire blazed under a pine and the blue column of smoke rose just
in front of the shelving rock Packs were lying on the grass and some
of them were open There were no signs here of a permanent habitation of
the hunter But farther on were other huge rocks leaning cracked and
forming caverns some of which perhaps he utilized

My camp is just back said Dale as if he had read Helens mind
Tomorrow well fix up comfortablelike round here for you girls

Helen and Bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them
and the men went about their tasks

Nellisnt thisa dream murmured Bo

No child Its realterribly real replied Helen Now that were
herewith that awful ride overwe can think

Its so prettyhere yawned Bo Id just as lief Uncle Al didnt
find us very soon

Bo Hes a sick man Think what the worry will be to him

Ill bet if he knows Dale he wont be so worried

Dale told us Uncle Al disliked him

Pooh What difference does that make Oh I dont know which I
amhungrier or tireder

I couldnt eat tonight said Helen wearily

When she stretched out she had a vague delicious sensation that that
was the end of Helen Rayner and she was glad Above her through the
lacy fernlike pineneedles she saw blue sky and a pale star just
showing Twilight was stealing down swiftly The silence was beautiful
seemingly undisturbed by the soft silky dreamy fall of water Helen
closed her eyes ready for sleep with the physical commotion within her
body gradually yielding In some places her bones felt as if they had
come out through her flesh in others throbbed deepseated aches her
muscles appeared slowly to subside to relax with the quivering twinges
ceasing one by one through muscle and bone through all her body
pulsed a burning current

Bos head dropped on Helens shoulder Sense became vague to Helen She
lost the low murmur of the waterfall and then the sound or feeling of
some one at the campfire And her last conscious thought was that she
tried to open her eyes and could not

When she awoke all was bright The sun shone almost directly overhead
Helen was astounded Bo lay wrapped in deep sleep her face flushed
with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp
Helen threw down the blankets and then gathering couragefor she felt
as if her back was brokenshe endeavored to sit up In vain Her spirit
was willing but her muscles refused to act It must take a violent
spasmodic effort She tried it with shut eyes and succeeding sat
there trembling The commotion she had made in the blankets awoke Bo
and she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight

HelloNell do I have toget up she asked sleepily

Can you queried Helen

Can I what Bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her
sister

Whyget up

Id like to know why not retorted Bo as she made the effort She got
one arm and shoulder up only to flop back like a crippled thing And
she uttered the most piteous little moan Im dead I knowI am

Well if youre going to be a Western girl youd better have spunk
enough to move

Ahuh ejaculated Bo Then she rolled over not without groans and
once upon her face she raised herself on her hands and turned to a
sitting posture Wheres everybody Oh Nell its perfectly lovely
here Paradise

Helen looked around A fire was smoldering No one was in sight
Wonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix
it upon nearby objects A beautiful little green tent or shack had been
erected out of spruce boughs It had a slanting roof that sloped all the
way from a ridgepole to the ground half of the opening in front was
closed as were the sides The spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in
the same direction giving it a smooth compact appearance actually as
if it had grown there

That leanto wasnt there last night inquired Bo

I didnt see it Leanto Whered you get that name

Its Western my dear Ill bet they put it up for us Sure I see
our bags inside Lets get up It must be late

The girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping
each other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly They were
delighted with the spruce leanto It faced the open and stood just
under the widespreading shelf of rock The tiny outlet from the spring
flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone to fall into
a little pool The floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips
of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth all laid one way smooth and
springy and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating Helen
and Bo opened their baggage and what with use of the cold water brush
and comb and clean blouses they made themselves feel as comfortable as
possible considering the excruciating aches Then they went out to the
campfire

Helens eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand Then
simultaneously with Bos cry of delight Helen saw a beautiful doe
approaching under the trees Dale walked beside it

You sure had a long sleep was the hunters greeting I reckon you
both look better

Good morning Or is it afternoon Were just able to move about said
Helen

I could ride declared Bo stoutly Oh Nell look at the deer Its
coming to me

The doe had hung back a little as Dale reached the campfire It was a
gray slender creature smooth as silk with great dark eyes It stood a
moment long ears erect and then with a graceful little trot came up
to Bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand All about it
except the beautiful soft eyes seemed wild and yet it was as tame as
a kitten Then suddenly as Bo fondled the long ears it gave a start
and breaking away ran back out of sight under the pines

What frightened it asked Bo

Dale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock There
twenty feet from the ground curled up on a ledge lay a huge tawny
animal with a face like that of a cat

Shes afraid of Tom replied Dale Recognizes him as a hereditary
foe I guess I cant make friends of them

Oh So thats Tomthe pet lion exclaimed Bo Ugh No wonder that
deer ran off

How long has he been up there queried Helen gazing fascinated at
Dales famous pet

I couldnt say Tom comes an goes replied Dale But I sent him up
there last night

And he was thereperfectly freeright over uswhile we slept burst
out Bo

Yes An I reckon you slept the safer for that

Of all things Nell isnt he a monster But he doesnt look like a
lionan African lion Hes a panther I saw his like at the circus
once

Hes a cougar said Dale The panther is long and slim Tom is not
only long but thick an round Ive had him four years An he was a
kitten no bigger n my fist when I got him

Is he perfectly tamesafe asked Helen anxiously

Ive never told anybody that Tom was safe but he is replied Dale
You can absolutely believe it A wild cougar wouldnt attack a man
unless cornered or starved An Tom is like a big kitten

The beast raised his great catlike face with its sleepy halfshut
eyes and looked down upon them

Shall I call him down inquired Dale

For once Bo did not find her voice

Let usget a little more used to himat a distance replied Helen
with a little laugh

If he comes to you just rub his head an youll see how tame he is
said Dale Reckon youre both hungry

Not so very returned Helen aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon
her

Well I am vouchsafed Bo

Soon as the turkeys done well eat My camp is round between the
rocks Ill call you

Not until his broad back was turned did Helen notice that the hunter
looked different Then she saw he wore a lighter cleaner suit of
buckskin with no coat and instead of the highheeled horsemans boots
he wore moccasins and leggings The change made him appear more lithe

Nell I dont know what you think but _I_ call him handsome declared
Bo

Helen had no idea what she thought

Lets try to walk some she suggested

So they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few
rods from their camp This point was close to the edge of the park from
which there was an unobstructed view

My What a place exclaimed Bo with eyes wide and round

Oh beautiful breathed Helen

An unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first Out of the black
spruce slopes shone patches of aspens gloriously red and gold and low
down along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park
not yet so blazing as those above but purple and yellow and white in
the sunshine Masses of silver spruce like trees in moonlight bordered
the park sending out here and there an isolated tree sharp as a
spear with underbranches close to the ground Long goldengreen grass
resembling halfripe wheat covered the entire floor of the park gently
waving to the wind Above sheered the black goldpatched slopes steep
and unscalable rising to buttresses of dark ironhued rock And to
the east circled the rows of cliffbench gray and old and fringed
splitting at the top in the notch where the lacy slumberous waterfall
like white smoke fell and vanished to reappear in wider sheet of lace
only to fall and vanish again in the green depths

It was a verdant valley deepset in the mountain walls wild and sad
and lonesome The waterfall dominated the spirit of the place dreamy
and sleepy and tranquil it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind and
lulled with another and sometimes died out altogether only to come
again in soft strange roar

Paradise Park whispered Bo to herself

A call from Dale disturbed their raptures Turning they hobbled with
eager but painful steps in the direction of a larger campfire situated
to the right of the great rock that sheltered their leanto No hut or
house showed there and none was needed Hidingplaces and homes for a
hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs split off
in bygone ages from the mountain wall above A few stately pines stood
out from the rocks and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown
brook This camp was only a step from the leanto round the corner of
a huge rock yet it had been out of sight Here indeed was evidence of
a hunters homepelts and skins and antlers a neat pile of split
firewood a long ledge of rock well sheltered and loaded with
bags like a huge pantryshelf packs and ropes and saddles tools and
weapons and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which
hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp

Hyaryou git shouted Dale and he threw a stick at something A bear
cub scampered away in haste He was small and woolly and brown and he
grunted as he ran Soon he halted

Thats Bud said Dale as the girls came up Guess he near starved in
my absence An now he wants everythin especially the sugar We dont
have sugar often up here

Isnt he dear Oh I love him cried Bo Come back Bud Come
Buddie

The cub however kept his distance watching Dale with bright little
eyes

Wheres Mr Roy asked Helen

Roys gone He was sorry not to say goodby But its important he gets
down in the pines on Ansons trail Hell hang to Anson an in case
they get near Pine hell ride in to see where your uncle is

What do you expect questioned Helen gravely

Most anythin he replied Al I reckon knows now Maybe hes
rustlin into the mountains by this time If he meets up with Anson
well an good for Roy wont be far off An sure if he runs across Roy
why theyll soon be here But if I were you I wouldnt count on seein
your uncle very soon Im sorry Ive done my best It sure is a bad
deal

Dont think me ungracious replied Helen hastily How plainly he
had intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be
compelled to accept his hospitality You are goodkind I owe you
much Ill be eternally grateful

Dale straightened as he looked at her His glance was intent piercing
He seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent No need for him
to say he had never before been spoken to like that

You may have to stay here with mefor weeksmaybe monthsif weve
the bad luck to get snowed in he said slowly as if startled at this
deduction Youre safe here No sheepthief could ever find this camp
Ill take risks to get you safe into Als hands But Im goin to be
pretty sure about what Im doin Sotheres plenty to eat an its
a pretty place

Pretty Why its grand exclaimed Bo Ive called it Paradise Park

Paradise Park he repeated weighing the words Youve named it an
also the creek Paradise Creek Ive been here twelve years with no fit
name for my home till you said that

Oh that pleases me returned Bo with shining eyes

Eat now said Dale An I reckon youll like that turkey

There was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming fragrant
pansroast turkey hot biscuits and gravy mashed potatoes as white as
if prepared at home stewed dried apples and butter and coffee This
bounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls when they had once
tasted the roast wild turkey then Milt Dale had occasion to blush at
their encomiums

I hopeUncle Aldoesnt come for a month declared Bo as she tried
to get her breath There was a brown spot on her nose and one on each
cheek suspiciously close to her mouth

Dale laughed It was pleasant to hear him for his laugh seemed unused
and deep as if it came from tranquil depths

Wont you eat with us asked Helen

Reckon I will he said itll save time an hot grub tastes better

Quite an interval of silence ensued which presently was broken by Dale

Here comes Tom

Helen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent seen erect
on allfours approaching with slow sinuous grace His color was tawny
with spots of whitish gray He had bowlegs big and round and furry
and a huge head with great tawny eyes No matter how tame he was said
to be he looked wild Like a dog he walked right up and it so happened
that he was directly behind Bo within reach of her when she turned

Oh Lord cried Bo and up went both of her hands in one of which
was a huge piece of turkey Tom took it not viciously but nevertheless
with a snap that made Helen jump As if by magic the turkey vanished
And Tom took a closer step toward Bo Her expression of fright changed
to consternation

He stole my turkey

Tom come here ordered Dale sharply The cougar glided round rather
sheepishly Now lie down an behave

Tom crouched on allfours his head resting on his paws with his
beautiful tawny eyes light and piercing fixed upon the hunter

Dont grab said Dale holding out a piece of turkey Whereupon Tom
took it less voraciously

As it happened the little bear cub saw this transaction and he plainly
indicated his opinion of the preference shown to Tom

Oh the dear exclaimed Bo He means its not fair Come
Budcome on

But Bud would not approach the group until called by Dale Then he
scrambled to them with every manifestation of delight Bo almost forgot
her own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him Tom
plainly showed his jealousy of Bud and Bud likewise showed his fear of
the great cat

Helen could not believe the evidence of her eyesthat she was in the
woods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet wildflavored meatthat
a fullgrown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear
sat on the otherthat a strange hunter a man of the forest there in
his lonely and isolated fastness appealed to the romance in her and
interested her as no one else she had ever met

When the wonderful meal was at last finished Bo enticed the bear cub
around to the camp of the girls and there soon became great comrades
with him Helen watching Bo play was inclined to envy her No matter
where Bo was placed she always got something out of it She adapted
herself She who could have a good time with almost any one or
anything would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park
of wild wonders

But merely objective actionsmerely physical movements had never yet
contented Helen She could run and climb and ride and play with hearty
and healthy abandon but those things would not suffice long for her
and her mind needed food Helen was a thinker One reason she had
desired to make her home in the West was that by taking up a life of the
open of action she might think and dream and brood less And here she
was in the wild West after the three most strenuously active days of
her career and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it
upon herself and upon all she saw

What can I do she asked Bo almost helplessly

Why rest you silly retorted Bo You walk like an old crippled
woman with only one leg

Helen hoped the comparison was undeserved but the advice was sound
The blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt
comfortably warm in the sunshine The breeze was slow languorous
fragrant and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall like
a melody of bees Helen made a pillow and lay down to rest The green
pineneedles so thin and fine in their crisscross network showed
clearly against the blue sky She looked in vain for birds Then
her gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great
amphitheater and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness
how far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere A black eagle sweeping
along looked of tiny size and yet he was far under the heights above
How pleasant she fancied it to be up there And drowsy fancy lulled her
to sleep

Helen slept all afternoon and upon awakening toward sunset found Bo
curled beside her Dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket
also he had built a campfire The air was growing keen and cold

Later when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats
beside the fire Dale came over apparently to visit them

I reckon you cant sleep all the time he said An bein city girls
youll get lonesome

Lonesome echoed Helen The idea of her being lonesome here had not
occurred to her

Ive thought that all out went on Dale as he sat down Indian
fashion before the blaze Its natural youd find time drag up here
bein used to lots of people an goinson an work an all girls
like

Id never be lonesome here replied Helen with her direct force

Dale did not betray surprise but he showed that his mistake was
something to ponder over

Excuse me he said presently as his gray eyes held hers Thats
how I had it As I remember girlsan it doesnt seem long since I left
homemost of them would die of lonesomeness up here Then he addressed
himself to Bo How about you You see I figured youd be the one that
liked it an your sister the one who wouldnt

I wont get lonesome very soon replied Bo

Im glad It worried me somenot ever havin girls as company before
An in a day or so when youre rested Ill help you pass the time

Bos eyes were full of flashing interest and Helen asked him How

It was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or
ironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest But as a
challenge he took it

How he repeated and a strange smile flitted across his face Why
by givin you rides an climbs to beautiful places An then if youre
interested to show you how little socalled civilized people know of
nature

Helen realized then that whatever his calling hunter or wanderer or
hermit he was not uneducated even if he appeared illiterate

Ill be happy to learn from you she said

Me too chimed in Bo You cant tell too much to any one from
Missouri

He smiled and that warmed Helen to him for then he seemed less removed
from other people About this hunter there began to be something of the
very nature of which he spokea stillness aloofness an unbreakable
tranquillity a cold clear spirit like that in the mountain air a
physical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the
strength of the pines

Ill bet I can tell you more n youll ever remember he said

What ll you bet retorted Bo

Well more roast turkey againstsay somethin nice when youre safe
an home to your uncle Als runnin his ranch

Agreed Nell you hear

Helen nodded her head

All right Well leave it to Nell began Dale half seriously Now
Ill tell you first for the fun of passin time well ride an race
my horses out in the park An well fish in the brooks an hunt in the
woods Theres an old silvertip around that you can see me kill An
well climb to the peaks an see wonderful sights So much for
that Now if you really want to learnor if you only want me to tell
youwell thats no matter Only Ill win the bet Youll see
how this park lies in the crater of a volcano an was once full of
wateran how the snow blows in on one side in winter a hundred feet
deep when theres none on the other An the treeshow they grow an
live an fight one another an depend on one another an protect
the forest from stormwinds An how they hold the water that is the
fountains of the great rivers An how the creatures an things that
live in them or on them are good for them an neither could live
without the other An then Ill show you my pets tame an untamed an
tell you how its man that makes any creature wildhow easy they are
to tamean how they learn to love you An theres the life of the
forest the strife of ithow the bear lives an the cats an the
wolves an the deer Youll see how cruel nature is how savage an
wild the wolf or cougar tears down the deerhow a wolf loves fresh hot
blood an how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck
An youll see that this cruelty of naturethis work of the wolf an
cougaris what makes the deer so beautiful an healthy an swift an
sensitive Without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an die
out An youll see how this principle works out among all creatures of
the forest Strife Its the meanin of all creation an the salvation
If youre quick to see youll learn that the nature here in the wilds
is the same as that of menonly men are no longer cannibals Trees
fight to livebirds fightanimals fightmen fight They all live
off one another An its this fightin that brings them all closer an
closer to bein perfect But nothin will ever be perfect

But how about religion interrupted Helen earnestly

Nature has a religion an its to liveto growto reproduce each of
its kind

But that is not God or the immortality of the soul declared Helen

Well its as close to God an immortality as nature ever gets

Oh you would rob me of my religion

No I just talk as I see life replied Dale reflectively as he poked
a stick into the red embers of the fire Maybe I have a religion I
dont know But its not the kind you havenot the Bible kind That
kind doesnt keep the men in Pine an Snowdrop an all oversheepmen
an ranchers an farmers an travelers such as Ive knownthe religion
they profess doesnt keep them from lyin cheatin stealin an
killin I reckon no man who lives as I dowhich perhaps is my
religionwill lie or cheat or steal or kill unless its to kill in
selfdefense or like Id do if Snake Anson would ride up here now
My religion maybe is love of lifewild life as it was in the
beginninan the wind that blows secrets from everywhere an the
water that sings all day an night an the stars that shine constant
an the trees that speak somehow an the rocks that arent dead Im
never alone here or on the trails Theres somethin unseen but always
with me An thats It Call it God if you like But what stalls me
iswhere was that Spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas Where
will that Spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this
globe an it hangs dead in space like the moon That time will come
Theres no waste in nature Not the littlest atom is destroyed It
changes thats all as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an feel
somethin thats heat come out of it Where does that go Its not lost
Nothin is lost So the beautiful an savin thought is maybe all
rock an wood water an blood an flesh are resolved back into the
elements to come to life somewhere again sometime

Oh what you say is wonderful but its terrible exclaimed Helen He
had struck deep into her soul

Terrible I reckon he replied sadly

Then ensued a little interval of silence

Milt Dale I lose the bet declared Bo with earnestness behind her
frivolity

Id forgotten that Reckon I talked a lot he said apologetically
You see I dont get much chance to talk except to myself or Tom
Years ago when I found the habit of silence settlin down on me I took
to thinkin out loud an talkin to anythin

I could listen to you all night returned Bo dreamily

Do you readdo you have books inquired Helen suddenly

Yes I read tolerable well a good deal better than I talk or write
he replied I went to school till I was fifteen Always hated study
but liked to read Years ago an old friend of mine down here at
PineWidow Cassshe gave me a lot of old books An I packed them up
here Winters the time I read

Conversation lagged after that except for desultory remarks and
presently Dale bade the girls good night and left them Helen watched
his tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines and after he had
disappeared she still stared

Nell called Bo shrilly Ive called you three times I want to go
to bed

Oh II was thinking rejoined Helen half embarrassed half
wondering at herself I didnt hear you

I should smile you didnt retorted Bo Wish you could just have seen
your eyes Nell do you want me to tell you something

Whyyes said Helen rather feebly She did not at all when Bo
talked like that

Youre going to fall in love with that wild hunter declared Bo in a
voice that rang like a bell

Helen was not only amazed but enraged She caught her breath
preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind Bo
went calmly on

I can feel it in my bones

Bo youre a little foola sentimental romancing gushy little fool
retorted Helen All you seem to hold in your head is some rot about
love To hear you talk one would think theres nothing else in the world
but love

Bos eyes were bright shrewd affectionate and laughing as she bent
their steady gaze upon Helen

Nell thats just it There IS nothing else



CHAPTER X

The night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for Helen to
believe that hours had passed Bo appeared livelier this morning with
less complaint of aches

Nell youve got color exclaimed Bo And your eyes are bright Isnt
the morning perfectly lovely Couldnt you get drunk on that air I
smell flowers And oh Im hungry

Bo our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your
appetite holds said Helen as she tried to keep her hair out of her
eyes while she laced her boots

Look theres a big doga hound

Helen looked as Bo directed and saw a hound of unusually large
proportions black and tan in color with long drooping ears Curiously
he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at
them His head was noble his eyes shone dark and sad He seemed neither
friendly nor unfriendly

Hello doggie Come right inwe wont hurt you called Bo but
without enthusiasm

This made Helen laugh Bo youre simply delicious she said Youre
afraid of that dog

Sure Wonder if hes Dales Of course he must be

Presently the hound trotted away out of sight When the girls presented
themselves at the campfire they espied their curious canine visitor
lying down His ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground

I sent Pedro over to wake you girls up said Dale after greeting
them Did he scare you

Pedro So thats his name No he didnt exactly scare me He did Nell
though Shes an awful tenderfoot replied Bo

Hes a splendidlooking dog said Helen ignoring her sisters sally
I love dogs Will he make friends

Hes shy an wild You see when I leave camp he wont hang around He
an Tom are jealous of each other I had a pack of hounds an lost all
but Pedro on account of Tom I think you can make friends with Pedro
Try it

Whereupon Helen made overtures to Pedro and not wholly in vain The
dog was matured of almost stern aloofness and manifestly not used to
people His deep winedark eyes seemed to search Helens soul They
were honest and wise with a strange sadness

He looks intelligent observed Helen as she smoothed the long dark
ears

That hound is nigh human responded Dale Come an while you eat
Ill tell you about Pedro

Dale had gotten the hound as a pup from a Mexican sheepherder who
claimed he was part California bloodhound He grew up becoming attached
to Dale In his younger days he did not get along well with Dales other
pets and Dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley Pedro was back
in Dales camp next day From that day Dale began to care more for the
hound but he did not want to keep him for various reasons chief of
which was the fact that Pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half
the time to shift for himself That fall Dale had need to go to the
farthest village Snowdrop where he left Pedro with a friend Then Dale
rode to Show Down and Pine and the camp of the Beemans and with them
he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles over into New Mexico
The snow was flying when Dale got back to his camp in the mountains
And there was Pedro gaunt and worn overjoyed to welcome him home Roy
Beeman visited Dale that October and told that Dales friend in Snowdrop
had not been able to keep Pedro He broke a chain and scaled a tenfoot
fence to escape He trailed Dale to Show Down where one of Dales
friends recognizing the hound caught him and meant to keep him until
Dales return But Pedro refused to eat It happened that a freighter
was going out to the Beeman camp and Dales friend boxed Pedro up and
put him on the wagon Pedro broke out of the box returned to Show Down
took up Dales trail to Pine and then on to the Beeman camp That was
as far as Roy could trace the movements of the hound But he believed
and so did Dale that Pedro had trailed them out on the wildhorse hunt
The following spring Dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at
whose camp he and the Beemans had rested on the way into New Mexico
It appeared that after Dale had left this camp Pedro had arrived and
another Mexican herder had stolen the hound But Pedro got away

An he was here when I arrived concluded Dale smiling I never
wanted to get rid of him after that Hes turned out to be the finest
dog I ever knew He knows what I say He can almost talk An I swear he
can cry He does whenever I start off without him

How perfectly wonderful exclaimed Bo Arent animals great But I
love horses best

It seemed to Helen that Pedro understood they were talking about him
for he looked ashamed and swallowed hard and dropped his gaze She
knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners
This story of Dales however was stranger than any she had ever heard

Tom the cougar put in an appearance then and there was scarcely love
in the tawny eyes he bent upon Pedro But the hound did not deign to
notice him Tom sidled up to Bo who sat on the farther side of the
tarpaulin tablecloth and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast

Gee I love the look of him she said But when hes close he makes
my flesh creep

Beasts are as queer as people observed Dale They take likes an
dislikes I believe Tom has taken a shine to you an Pedro begins to be
interested in your sister I can tell

Wheres Bud inquired Bo

Hes asleep or around somewhere Now soon as I get the work done what
would you girls like to do

Ride declared Bo eagerly

Arent you sore an stiff

I am that But I dont care Besides when I used to go out to my
uncles farm near Saint Joe I always found riding to be a cure for
aches

Sure is if you can stand it An what will your sister like to do
returned Dale turning to Helen

Oh Ill rest and watch you folksand dream replied Helen

But after youve rested you must be active said Dale seriously You
must do things It doesnt matter what just as long as you dont sit
idle

Why queried Helen in surprise Why not be idle here in this
beautiful wild place just to dream away the hoursthe days I could
do it

But you mustnt It took me years to learn how bad that was for me An
right now I would love nothin more than to forget my work my horses
an petseverythin an just lay around seein an feelin

Seeing and feeling Yes that must be what I mean But whywhat is
it There are the beauty and colorthe wild shaggy slopesthe gray
cliffsthe singing windthe lulling waterthe cloudsthe sky And
the silence loneliness sweetness of it all

Its a driftin back What I love to do an yet fear most Its what
makes a lone hunter of a man An it can grow so strong that it binds a
man to the wilds

How strange murmured Helen But that could never bind ME Why I
must live and fulfil my mission my work in the civilized world

It seemed to Helen that Dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest
words

The ways of Nature are strange he said I look at it different
Natures just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to
be civilized An if Nature won you would carry out her design all the
better

This hunters talk shocked Helen and yet stimulated her mind

Mea savage Oh no she exclaimed But if that were possible what
would Natures design be

You spoke of your mission in life he replied A womans mission is
to have children The female of any species has only one missionto
reproduce its kind An Nature has only one missiontoward greater
strength virility efficiencyabsolute perfection which is
unattainable

What of mental and spiritual development of man and woman asked
Helen

Both are direct obstacles to the design of Nature Nature is physical
To create for limitless endurance for eternal life That must be
Natures inscrutable design An why she must fail

But the soul whispered Helen

Ah When you speak of the soul an I speak of life we mean the same
You an I will have some talks while youre here I must brush up my
thoughts

So must I it seems said Helen with a slow smile She had been
rendered grave and thoughtful But I guess Ill risk dreaming under the
pines

Bo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes

Nell itd take a thousand years to make a savage of you she said
But a week will do for me

Bo you were one before you left Saint Joe replied Helen Dont you
remember that schoolteacher Barnes who said you were a wildcat and an
Indian mixed He spanked you with a ruler

Never He missed me retorted Bo with red in her cheeks Nell I
wish youd not tell things about me when I was a kid

That was only two years ago expostulated Helen in mild surprise

Suppose it was I was a kid all right Ill bet you Bo broke up
abruptly and tossing her head she gave Tom a pat and then ran away
around the corner of cliff wall

Helen followed leisurely

Say Nell said Bo when Helen arrived at their little green
ledgepole hut do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your
theories

Maybe Ill admit he amazes meand affronts me too Im afraid
replied Helen What surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack
of schooling hes not raw or crude Hes elemental

Sister dear wake up The mans wonderful You can learn more from
him than you ever learned in your life So can I I always hated books
anyway

When a little later Dale approached carrying some bridles the hound
Pedro trotted at his heels

I reckon youd better ride the horse you had he said to Bo

Whatever you say But I hope you let me ride them all by and by

Sure Ive a mustang out there youll like But he pitches a little
he rejoined and turned away toward the park The hound looked after him
and then at Helen

Come Pedro Stay with me called Helen

Dale hearing her motioned the hound back Obediently Pedro trotted to
her still shy and soberly watchful as if not sure of her intentions
but with something of friendliness about him now Helen found a soft
restful seat in the sun facing the park and there composed herself for
what she felt would be slow sweet idle hours Pedro curled down beside
her The tall form of Dale stalked across the park out toward the
straggling horses Again she saw a deer grazing among them How erect
and motionless it stood watching Dale Presently it bounded away toward
the edge of the forest Some of the horses whistled and ran kicking
heels high in the air The shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness

Gee Look at them go exclaimed Bo gleefully coming up to where
Helen sat Bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pineneedles and
stretched herself languorously like a lazy kitten There was something
feline in her lithe graceful outline She lay flat and looked up
through the pines

Wouldnt it be great now she murmured dreamily half to herself
if that Las Vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come and then an
earthquake would shut us up here in this Paradise valley so wed never
get out

Bo What would mother say to such talk as that gasped Helen

But Nell wouldnt it be great

It would be terrible

Oh there never was any romance in you Nell Rayner replied Bo That
very thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country
of wild places You need not tell me Sure its happened With the
cliffdwellers and the Indians and then white people Every place I look
makes me feel that Nell youd have to see people in the moon through a
telescope before youd believe that

Im practical and sensible thank goodness

But for the sake of argument protested Bo with flashing eyes
suppose it MIGHT happen Just to please me suppose we DID get shut up
here with Dale and that cowboy we saw from the train Shut in without
any hope of ever climbing out What would you do Would you give up
and pine away and die Or would you fight for life and whatever joy it
might mean

Selfpreservation is the first instinct replied Helen surprised at
a strange deep thrill in the depths of her Id fight for life of
course

Yes Well really when I think seriously I dont want anything like
that to happen But just the same if it DID happen I would glory in
it

While they were talking Dale returned with the horses

Can you bridle an saddle your own horse he asked

No Im ashamed to say I cant replied Bo

Time to learn then Come on Watch me first when I saddle mine

Bo was all eyes while Dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and
then with slow plain action readjusted it Next he smoothed the back of
the horse shook out the blanket and folding it half over he threw
it in place being careful to explain to Bo just the right position He
lifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place and then he
tightened the cinches

Now you try he said

According to Helens judgment Bo might have been a Western girl all her
days But Dale shook his head and made her do it over

That was better Of course the saddle is too heavy for you to sling
it up You can learn that with a light one Now put the bridle on
again Dont be afraid of your hands He wont bite Slip the bit in
sideways There Now lets see you mount

When Bo got into the saddle Dale continued You went up quick an
light but the wrong way Watch me

Bo had to mount several times before Dale was satisfied Then he told
her to ride off a little distance When Bo had gotten out of earshot
Dale said to Helen Shell take to a horse like a duck takes to water
Then mounting he rode out after her

Helen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round
the grassy park and rather regretted she had not gone with them
Eventually Bo rode back to dismount and fling herself down redcheeked
and radiant with disheveled hair and curls damp on her temples How
alive she seemed Helens senses thrilled with the grace and charm
and vitality of this surprising sister and she was aware of a sheer
physical joy in her presence Bo rested but she did not rest long She
was soon off to play with Bud Then she coaxed the tame doe to eat
out of her hand She dragged Helen off for wild flowers curious and
thoughtless by turns And at length she fell asleep quickly in a way
that reminded Helen of the childhood now gone forever

Dale called them to dinner about four oclock as the sun was reddening
the western rampart of the park Helen wondered where the day had gone
The hours had flown swiftly serenely bringing her scarcely a thought
of her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible
discovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her After
she realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and
indescribable feeling of what Dale had meant about dreaming the hours
away The nature of Paradise Park was inimical to the kind of thought
that had habitually been hers She found the new thought absorbing yet
when she tried to name it she found that after all she had only felt
At the meal hour she was more than usually quiet She saw that Dale
noticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention He
succeeded but she did not choose to let him see that She strolled
away alone to her seat under the pine Bo passed her once and cried
tantalizingly

My Nell but youre growing romantic

Never before in Helens life had the beauty of the evening star seemed
so exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so
charged with loneliness It was their environmentthe accompaniment of
wild wolfmourn of the murmuring waterfall of this strange man of the
forest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home


Next morning her energy having returned Helen shared Bos lesson in
bridling and saddling her horse and in riding Bo however rode so
fast and so hard that for Helen to share her company was impossible And
Dale interested and amused yet anxious spent most of his time
with Bo It was thus that Helen rode all over the park alone She was
astonished at its size when from almost any point it looked so small
The atmosphere deceived her How clearly she could see And she began to
judge distance by the size of familiar things A horse looked at across
the longest length of the park seemed very small indeed Here and
there she rode upon dark swift little brooks exquisitely clear and
ambercolored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass These all
ran one way and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound
under the cliffs at the west end and plunged to an outlet in narrow
clefts When Dale and Bo came to her once she made inquiry and she was
surprised to learn from Dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in
the rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain Sometime
he would take them to the lake it formed

Over the mountain asked Helen again remembering that she must regard
herself as a fugitive Will it be safe to leave our hidingplace I
forget so often why we are here

We would be better hidden over there than here replied Dale The
valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge An dont worry
about bein found I told you Roy Beeman is watchin Anson an his gang
Roy will keep between them an us

Helen was reassured yet there must always linger in the background of
her mind a sense of dread In spite of this she determined to make the
most of her opportunity Bo was a stimulus And so Helen spent the rest
of that day riding and tagging after her sister

The next day was less hard on Helen Activity rest eating and
sleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her She had really never
known them as strange joys She rode she walked she climbed a little
she dozed under her pinetree she worked helping Dale at campfire
tasks and when night came she said she did not know herself That fact
haunted her in vague deep dreams Upon awakening she forgot her resolve
to study herself That day passed And then several more went swiftly
before she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe
might last for weeks and even months


It was afternoon that Helen loved best of all the time of the day
The sunrise was fresh beautiful the morning was windy fragrant the
sunset was rosy glorious the twilight was sad changing and night
seemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep But the
afternoon when nothing changed when all was serene when time seemed
to halt that was her choice and her solace

One afternoon she had camp all to herself Bo was riding Dale had
climbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see
any smoke from campfire Bud was nowhere to be seen nor any of the
other pets Tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in
the sun after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species Pedro
had not been seen for a night and a day a fact that Helen had noted
with concern However she had forgotten him and therefore was the more
surprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs

Why Pedro You have been fighting Come here she called

The hound did not look guilty He limped to her and held up his right
fore paw The action was unmistakable Helen examined the injured member
and presently found a piece of what looked like musselshell embedded
deeply between the toes The wound was swollen bloody and evidently
very painful Pedro whined Helen had to exert all the strength of her
fingers to pull it out Then Pedro howled But immediately he showed his
gratitude by licking her hand Helen bathed his paw and bound it up

When Dale returned she related the incident and showing the piece of
shell she asked Where did that come from Are there shells in the
mountains

Once this country was under the sea replied Dale Ive found things
that d make you wonder

Under the sea ejaculated Helen It was one thing to have read of
such a strange fact but a vastly different one to realize it here among
these lofty peaks Dale was always showing her something or telling her
something that astounded her

Look here he said one day What do you make of that little bunch of
aspens

They were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a
pinetree The forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling
lines of spruce and groves of aspen The little clump of aspens did not
differ from hundreds Helen had seen

I dont make anything particularly of it replied Helen dubiously
Just a tiny grove of aspenssome very small some larger but none
very big But its pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering
and quivering

It doesnt make you think of a fight

Fight No it certainly does not replied Helen

Well its as good an example of fight of strife of selfishness as
you will find in the forest he said Now come over you an Bo an
let me show you what I mean

Come on Nell cried Bo with enthusiasm Hell open our eyes some
more

Nothing loath Helen went with them to the little clump of aspens

About a hundred altogether said Dale Theyre pretty well shaded by
the spruces but they get the sunlight from east an south These little
trees all came from the same seedlings Theyre all the same age Four
of them stand say ten feet or more high an theyre as large around as
my wrist Heres one thats largest See how fullfoliaged he ishow he
stands over most of the others but not so much over these four next to
him They all stand close together very close you see Most of them
are no larger than my thumb Look how few branches they have an none
low down Look at how few leaves Do you see how all the branches stand
out toward the east an southhow the leaves of course face the same
way See how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree
Thats a fight for the sunlight Here are onetwothree dead trees
Look I can snap them off An now look down under them Here are little
trees five feet highfour feet highdown to these only a foot
high Look how pale delicate fragile unhealthy They get so little
sunshine They were born with the other trees but did not get an equal
start Position gives the advantage perhaps

Dale led the girls around the little grove illustrating his words by
action He seemed deeply in earnest

You understand its a fight for water an sun But mostly sun because
if the leaves can absorb the sun the tree an roots will grow to grasp
the needed moisture Shade is deathslow death to the life of trees
These little aspens are fightin for place in the sunlight It is a
merciless battle They push an bend one anothers branches aside an
choke them Only perhaps half of these aspens will survive to make one
of the larger clumps such as that one of fullgrown trees over there
One season will give advantage to this saplin an next year to that
one A few seasons advantage to one assures its dominance over the
others But it is never sure of holdin that dominance An if wind or
storm or a stronggrowin rival does not overthrow it then sooner or
later old age will For there is absolute and continual fight What is
true of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an of all
plant life in the forest What is most wonderful to me is the tenacity
of life

And next day Dale showed them an even more striking example of this
mystery of nature

He guided them on horseback up one of the thick verdantwooded slopes
calling their attention at various times to the different growths until
they emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant
and dwarfed At the edge of timberline he showed a gnarled and knotted
sprucetree twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce bent
and stormblasted with almost bare branches all reaching one way The
tree was a specter It stood alone It had little green upon it There
seemed something tragic about its contortions But it was alive and
strong It had no rivals to take sun or moisture Its enemies were the
snow and wind and cold of the heights

Helen felt as the realization came to her the knowledge Dale wished
to impart that it was as sad as wonderful and as mysterious as it was
inspiring At that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of
lifethe pain and the joyin Helens heart These strange facts
were going to teach herto transform her And even if they hurt she
welcomed them



CHAPTER XI

Ill ride you if it breaksmy neck panted Bo passionately shaking
her gloved fist at the gray pony

Dale stood near with a broad smile on his face Helen was within
earshot watching from the edge of the park and she felt so fascinated
and frightened that she could not call out for Bo to stop The little
gray mustang was a beauty cleanlimbed and racy with long black mane
and tail and a fine spirited head There was a blanket strapped on his
back but no saddle Bo held the short halter that had been fastened
in a hackamore knot round his nose She wore no coat her blouse was
covered with grass and seeds and it was open at the neck her hair hung
loose and disheveled one side of her face bore a stain of grass and
dirt and a suspicion of blood the other was red and white her eyes
blazed beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her
cheeks As she began to strain on the halter pulling herself closer
to the fiery pony the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and
strong

Bo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride
Dales mustang and she was furious The mustang did not appear to be
vicious or mean But he was spirited tricky mischievous and he had
thrown her six times The scene of Bos defeat was at the edge of the
park where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall
It also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang obviously placing
him at a disadvantage Dale did not bridle him because he had not been
broken to a bridle and though it was harder for Bo to try to ride him
bareback there was less risk of her being hurt Bo had begun in all
eagerness and enthusiasm loving and petting the mustang which she
named Pony She had evidently anticipated an adventure but her
smiling resolute face had denoted confidence Pony had stood fairly
well to be mounted and then had pitched and tossed until Bo had slid
off or been upset or thrown After each fall Bo bounced up with less of
a smile and more of spirit until now the Western passion to master a
horse had suddenly leaped to life within her It was no longer fun no
more a daring circus trick to scare Helen and rouse Dales admiration
The issue now lay between Bo and the mustang

Pony reared snorting tossing his head and pawing with front feet

Pull him down yelled Dale

Bo did not have much weight but she had strength an she hauled with
all her might finally bringing him down

Now hold hard an take up rope an get in to him called Dale Good
Youre sure not afraid of him He sees that Now hold him talk to him
tell him youre goin to ride him Pet him a little An when he quits
shakin grab his mane an jump up an slide a leg over him Then hook
your feet under him hard as you can an stick on

If Helen had not been so frightened for Bo she would have been able to
enjoy her other sensations Creeping cold thrills chased over her as
Bo supple and quick slid an arm and a leg over Pony and straightened
up on him with a defiant cry Pony jerked his head down brought his
feet together in one jump and began to bounce Bo got the swing of him
this time and stayed on

Youre ridin him yelled Dale Now squeeze hard with your knees
Crack him over the head with your rope Thats the way Hang on now
an youll have him beat

The mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to Dale and Helen
tearing up the moss and grass Several times he tossed Bo high but she
slid back to grip him again with her legs and he could not throw her
Suddenly he raised his head and bolted Dale answered Bos triumphant
cry But Pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell
throwing Bo far over his head As luck would have itgood luck
Dale afterward saidshe landed in a boggy place and the force of her
momentum was such that she slid several yards face down in wet moss
and black ooze

Helen uttered a scream and ran forward Bo was getting to her knees when
Dale reached her He helped her up and half led half carried her out
of the boggy place Bo was not recognizable From head to foot she was
dripping black ooze

Oh Bo Are you hurt cried Helen

Evidently Bos mouth was full of mud

Ppsutt Ough Whew she sputtered Hurt No Cant you see what I
lit in Dale the sunofagun didnt throw me He fell and I went over
his head

Right You sure rode him An he tripped an slung you a mile replied
Dale Its lucky you lit in that bog

Lucky With eyes and nose stopped up Oooo Im full of mud And my
nicenew ridingsuit

Bos tones indicated that she was ready to cry Helen realizing Bo
had not been hurt began to laugh Her sister was the funniestlooking
object that had ever come before her eyes

Nell Raynerare youlaughingat me demanded Bo in most righteous
amaze and anger

Me laughing Nnever Bo replied Helen Cant you see Im
justjust

See You idiot my eyes are full of mud flashed Bo But I hear you
IllIll get even

Dale was laughing too but noiselessly and Bo being blind for the
moment could not be aware of that By this time they had reached camp
Helen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before When Helen
forgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing
matter Dales big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and
wetting it at the spring began to wipe the mud off Bos face But that
did not serve Bo asked to be led to the water where she knelt and
with splashing washed out her eyes and then her face and then the
bedraggled strands of hair

That mustang didnt break my neck but he rooted my face in the mud
Ill fix him she muttered as she got up Please let me have the
towel now Well Milt Dale youre laughing

Excuse me Bo IHaw haw haw Then Dale lurched off holding his
sides

Bo gazed after him and then back at Helen

I suppose if Id been kicked and smashed and killed youd laugh she
said And then she melted Oh my pretty ridingsuit What a mess I
must be a sight Nell I rode that wild ponythe sunofagun I
rode him Thats enough for me YOU try it Laugh all you want It was
funny But if you want to square yourself with me help me clean my
clothes


Late in the night Helen heard Dale sternly calling Pedro She felt some
little alarm However nothing happened and she soon went to sleep
again At the morning meal Dale explained

Pedro an Tom were uneasy last night I think there are lions workin
over the ridge somewhere I heard one scream

Scream inquired Bo with interest

Yes an if you ever hear a lion scream you will think it a woman in
mortal agony The cougar cry as Roy calls it is the wildest to be
heard in the woods A wolf howls He is sad hungry and wild But a
cougar seems human an dyin an wild Well saddle up an ride over
there Maybe Pedro will tree a lion Bo if he does will you shoot it

Sure replied Bo with her mouth full of biscuit

That was how they came to take a long slow steep ride under cover of
dense spruce Helen liked the ride after they got on the heights But
they did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure
of gazing afar over the ranges Dale led up and down and finally mostly
down until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with
parks lying below and streams shining in the sun

More than once Pedro had to be harshly called by Dale The hound scented
game

Heres an old kill said Dale halting to point at some bleached bones
scattered under a spruce Tufts of grayishwhite hair lay strewn around

What was it asked Bo

Deer of course Killed there an eaten by a lion Sometime last fall
See even the skull is split But I could not say that the lion did it

Helen shuddered She thought of the tame deer down at Dales camp How
beautiful and graceful and responsive to kindness

They rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of
some green bushes bordering it Here Pedro barked the first time Helen
had heard him The hair on his neck bristled and it required stern
calls from Dale to hold him in Dale dismounted

Hyar Pede you get back he ordered Ill let you go presently
Girls youre goin to see somethin But stay on your horses

Dale with the hound tense and bristling beside him strode here
and there at the edge of the swale Presently he halted on a slight
elevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over

Here see where the grass is pressed down all nice an round he said
pointing A lion made that He sneaked there watchin for deer That
was done this mornin Come on now Lets see if we can trail him

Dale stooped now studying the grass and holding Pedro Suddenly he
straightened up with a flash in his gray eyes

Heres where he jumped

But Helen could not see any reason why Dale should say that The man of
the forest took a long stride then another

An heres where that lion lit on the back of the deer It was a big
jump See the sharp hoof tracks of the deer Dale pressed aside tall
grass to show dark rough fresh tracks of a deer evidently made by
violent action

Come on called Dale walking swiftly Youre sure goin to see
somethin now Heres where the deer bounded carryin the lion

What exclaimed Bo incredulously

The deer was runnin here with the lion on his back Ill prove it to
you Come on now Pedro you stay with me Girls its a fresh trail
Dale walked along leading his horse and occasionally he pointed down
into the grass There See that Thats hair

Helen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground and
she believed she saw little dark separations in the grass where an
animal had recently passed All at once Dale halted When Helen reached
him Bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide flattened
space in the grass Even Helens inexperienced eyes could make out
evidences of a struggle Tufts of graywhite hair lay upon the crushed
grass Helen did not need to see any more but Dale silently pointed to
a patch of blood Then he spoke

The lion brought the deer down here an killed him Probably broke his
neck That deer ran a hundred yards with the lion See heres the trail
left where the lion dragged the deer off

A welldefined path showed across the swale

Girls youll see that deer pretty quick declared Dale starting
forward This work has just been done Only a few minutes ago

How can you tell queried Bo

Look See that grass It has been bent down by the deer bein dragged
over it Now its springin up

Dales next stop was on the other side of the swale under a spruce with
low spreading branches The look of Pedro quickened Helens pulse
He was wild to give chase Fearfully Helen looked where Dale pointed
expecting to see the lion But she saw instead a deer lying prostrate
with tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair

Girls that lion heard us an left Hes not far said Dale as he
stooped to lift the head of the deer Warm Neck broken See the lions
teeth an claw marks Its a doe Look here Dont be squeamish
girls This is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest
See where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as I could do it
an hed just begun to bite in there when he heard us

What murderous work The sight sickens me exclaimed Helen

It is nature said Dale simply

Lets kill the lion added Bo

For answer Dale took a quick turn at their saddlegirths and then
mounting he called to the hound Hunt him up Pedro

Like a shot the hound was off

Ride in my tracks an keep close to me called Dale as he wheeled his
horse

Were off squealed Bo in wild delight and she made her mount
plunge

Helen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the
swale to the woods Pedro was running straight with his nose high
He let out one short bark He headed into the woods with Dale not far
behind Helen was on one of Dales best horses but that fact scarcely
manifested itself because the others began to increase their lead They
entered the woods It was open and fairly good going Bos horse ran as
fast in the woods as he did in the open That frightened Helen and she
yelled to Bo to hold him in She yelled to deaf ears That was Bos
great riskshe did not intend to be careful Suddenly the forest rang
with Dales encouraging yell meant to aid the girls in following him
Helens horse caught the spirit of the chase He gained somewhat on
Bo hurdling logs sometimes two at once Helens blood leaped with a
strange excitement utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless Yet
her natural fear and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish
risk of this ride shared alike in her sum of sensations She tried to
remember Dales caution about dodging branches and snags and sliding
her knees back to avoid knocks from trees She barely missed some
frightful reaching branches She received a hard knock then another
that unseated her but frantically she held on and slid back and at the
end of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging
blow in the face from a farspreading branch of pine Bo missed by what
seemed only an inch a solid snag that would have broken her in two
Both Pedro and Dale got out of Helens sight Then Helen as she began
to lose Bo felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left
behind to get lost in the forest and she urged her horse Dales yell
pealed back Then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than
by sight Wind and brush tore at her The air was heavily pungent with
odor of pine Helen heard a wild full bay of the hound ringing back
full of savage eagerness and she believed Pedro had roused out the lion
from some covert It lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her
horse on faster

Then the swift pace slackened A windfall of timber delayed Helen She
caught a glimpse of Dale far ahead climbing a slope The forest seemed
full of his ringing yell Helen strangely wished for level ground and
the former swift motion Next she saw Bo working down to the right and
Dales yell now came from that direction Helen followed got out of the
timber and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park

When she reached the open she saw Bo almost across this narrow open
ground Here Helen did not need to urge her mount He snorted and
plunged at the level and he got to going so fast that Helen would
have screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been
breathless

Her horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground He went to his knees
and Helen sailed out of the saddle over his head Soft willows and wet
grass broke her fall She was surprised to find herself unhurt Up she
bounded and certainly did not know this new Helen Rayner Her horse was
coming and he had patience with her but he wanted to hurry Helen made
the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it
She would tell Bo that But just then Bo flashed into the woods out of
sight Helen fairly charged into that green foliage breaking brush and
branches She broke through into open forest Bo was inside riding down
an aisle between pines and spruces At that juncture Helen heard Dales
melodious yell near at hand Coming into still more open forest with
rocks here and there she saw Dale dismounted under a pine and Pedro
standing with fore paws upon the treetrunk and then high up on a
branch a huge tawny colored lion just like Tom

Bos horse slowed up and showed fear but he kept on as far as Dales
horse But Helens refused to go any nearer She had difficulty in
halting him Presently she dismounted and throwing her bridle over a
stump she ran on panting and fearful yet tingling all over up to her
sister and Dale

Nell you did pretty good for a tenderfoot was Bos greeting

It was a fine chase said Dale You both rode well I wish you could
have seen the lion on the ground He boundedgreat long bounds with
his tail up in the airvery funny An Pedro almost caught up with him
That scared me because he would have killed the hound Pedro was close
to him when he treed An there he isthe yellow deerkiller Hes a
male an full grown

With that Dale pulled his rifle from its saddlesheath and looked
expectantly at Bo But she was gazing with great interest and admiration
up at the lion

Isnt he just beautiful she burst out Oh look at him spit Just
like a cat Dale he looks afraid he might fall off

He sure does Lions are never sure of their balance in a tree But I
never saw one make a misstep He knows he doesnt belong there

To Helen the lion looked splendid perched up there He was long and
round and graceful and tawny His tongue hung out and his plump sides
heaved showing what a quick hard run he had been driven to What
struck Helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he
looked down at the hound He was scared He realized his peril It was
not possible for Helen to watch him killed yet she could not bring
herself to beg Bo not to shoot Helen confessed she was a tenderfoot

Get down Bo an lets see how good a shot you are said Dale Bo
slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a
rueful smile at Dale

Ive changed my mind I said I would kill him but now I cant He
looks soso different from what Id imagined

Dales answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed
Helens heart toward him All the same he was amused Sheathing the
gun he mounted his horse

Come on Pedro he called Come I tell you he added sharply
Well girls we treed him anyhow an it was fun Now well ride back
to the deer he killed an pack a haunch to camp for our own use

Will the lion go back to hishis kill I think you called it asked
Bo

Ive chased one away from his kill half a dozen times Lions are not
plentiful here an they dont get overfed I reckon the balance is
pretty even

This last remark made Helen inquisitive And as they slowly rode on the
backtrail Dale talked

You girls bein tenderhearted an not knowin the life of the forest
whats good an whats bad think it was a pity the poor deer was
killed by a murderous lion But youre wrong As I told you the lion is
absolutely necessary to the health an joy of wild lifeor deers wild
life so to speak When deer were created or came into existence
then the lion must have come too They cant live without each other
Wolves now are not particularly deerkillers They live off elk an
anythin they can catch So will lions for that matter But I mean
lions follow the deer to an fro from winter to summer feedingrounds
Where theres no deer you will find no lions Well now if left alone
deer would multiply very fast In a few years there would be hundreds
where now theres only one An in time as the generations passed
theyd lose the fear the alertness the speed an strength the
eternal vigilance that is love of lifetheyd lose that an begin
to deteriorate an disease would carry them off I saw one season of
blacktongue among deer It killed them off an I believe that is one
of the diseases of overproduction The lions now are forever on the
trail of the deer They have learned Wariness is an instinct born in
the fawn It makes him keen quick active fearful an so he grows up
strong an healthy to become the smooth sleek beautiful softeyed
an wildlookin deer you girls love to watch But if it wasnt for
the lions the deer would not thrive Only the strongest an swiftest
survive That is the meanin of nature There is always a perfect
balance kept by nature It may vary in different years but on the
whole in the long years it averages an even balance

How wonderfully you put it exclaimed Bo with all her impulsiveness
Oh Im glad I didnt kill the lion

What you say somehow hurts me said Helen wistfully to the hunter
I seeI feel how truehow inevitable it is But it changes mymy
feelings Almost Id rather not acquire such knowledge as yours This
balance of naturehow tragichow sad

But why asked Dale You love birds an birds are the greatest
killers in the forest

Dont tell me thatdont prove it implored Helen It is not so much
the love of life in a deer or any creature and the terrible clinging to
life that gives me distress It is suffering I cant bear to see pain
I can STAND pain myself but I cant BEAR to see or think of it

Well replied Dale thoughtfully There you stump me again Ive
lived long in the forest an when a mans alone he does a heap of
thinkin An always I couldnt understand a reason or a meanin
for pain Of all the bafflin things of life that is the hardest to
understand an to forgivepain


That evening as they sat in restful places round the campfire with
the still twilight fading into night Dale seriously asked the girls
what the days chase had meant to them His manner of asking was
productive of thought Both girls were silent for a moment

Glorious was Bos brief and eloquent reply

Why asked Dale curiously You are a girl Youve been used to
home people love comfort safety quiet

Maybe that is just why it was glorious said Bo earnestly I can
hardly explain I loved the motion of the horse the feel of wind in
my face the smell of the pine the sight of slope and forest glade and
windfall and rocks and the black shade under the spruces My blood
beat and burned My teeth clicked My nerves all quivered My heart
sometimes at dangerous moments almost choked me and all the time it
pounded hard Now my skin was hot and then it was cold But I think the
best of that chase for me was that I was on a fast horse guiding him
controlling him He was alive Oh how I felt his running

Well what you say is as natural to me as if I felt it said Dale I
wondered Youre certainly full of fire An Helen what do you say

Bo has answered you with her feelings replied Helen I could not do
that and be honest The fact that Bo wouldnt shoot the lion after we
treed him acquits her Nevertheless her answer is purely physical You
know Mr Dale how you talk about the physical I should say my sister
was just a young wild highly sensitive hotblooded female of the
species She exulted in that chase as an Indian Her sensations were
inherited onescertainly not acquired by education Bo always hated
study The ride was a revelation to me I had a good many of Bos
feelingsthough not so strong But over against them was the opposition
of reason of consciousness A newborn side of my nature confronted me
strange surprising violent irresistible It was as if another side of
my personality suddenly said Here I am Reckon with me now And there
was no use for the moment to oppose that strange side Ithe thinking
Helen Rayner was powerless Oh yes I had such thoughts even when the
branches were stinging my face and I was thrilling to the bay of the
hound Once my horse fell and threw me You neednt look alarmed
It was fine I went into a soft place and was unhurt But when I was
sailing through the air a thought flashed this is the end of me It was
like a dream when you are falling dreadfully Much of what I felt and
thought on that chase must have been because of what I have studied and
read and taught The reality of it the action and flash were splendid
But fear of danger pity for the chased lion consciousness of foolish
risk of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility I have
takenall these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a
sheer physical primitive joy of the wild moment

Dale listened intently and after Helen had finished he studied the fire
and thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick His face was still
and serene untroubled and unlined but to Helen his eyes seemed sad
pensive expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder She had
carefully and earnestly spoken because she was very curious to hear
what he might say

I understand you he replied presently An Im sure surprised that
I can Ive read my booksan reread them but no one ever talked like
that to me What I make of it is this Youve the same blood in you
thats in Bo An blood is stronger than brain Remember that blood is
life It would be good for you to have it run an beat an burn as
Bos did Your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before
intellect was born in your ancestors Instinct may not be greater than
reason but its a million years older Dont fight your instincts so
hard If they were not good the God of Creation would not have given
them to you Today your mind was full of selfrestraint that did not
altogether restrain You couldnt forget yourself You couldnt FEEL
only as Bo did You couldnt be true to your real nature

I dont agree with you replied Helen quickly I dont have to be an
Indian to be true to myself

Why yes you do said Dale

But I couldnt be an Indian declared Helen spiritedly I couldnt
FEEL only as you say Bo did I couldnt go back in the scale as you
hint What would all my education amount tothough goodness knows its
little enoughif I had no control over primitive feelings that happened
to be born in me

Youll have little or no control over them when the right time comes
replied Dale Your sheltered life an education have led you away from
natural instincts But theyre in you an youll learn the proof of that
out here

No Not if I lived a hundred years in the West asserted Helen

But child do you know what youre talkin about

Here Bo let out a blissful peal of laughter

Mr Dale exclaimed Helen almost affronted She was stirred I know
MYSELF at least

But you do not Youve no idea of yourself Youve education yes but
not in nature an life An after all they are the real things Answer
me nowhonestly will you

Certainly if I can Some of your questions are hard to answer

Have you ever been starved he asked

No replied Helen

Have you ever been lost away from home

No

Have you ever faced deathreal stark an naked death close an
terrible

No indeed

Have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands

Oh Mr Dale youyou amaze me No No

I reckon I know your answer to my last question but Ill ask it
anyhow Have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could
not live without him

Bo fell off her seat with a high trilling laugh Oh you two are
great

Thank Heaven I havent been replied Helen shortly

Then you dont know anythin about life declared Dale with finality

Helen was not to be put down by that dubious and troubled as it made
her

Have you experienced all those things she queried stubbornly

All but the last one Love never came my way How could it I live
alone I seldom go to the villages where there are girls No girl would
ever care for me I have nothin But all the same I understand
love a little just by comparison with strong feelins Ive lived

Helen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity His sad and
penetrating gaze was on the fire as if in its white heart to read the
secret denied him He had said that no girl would ever love him She
imagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than
of the forest

To come back to myself said Helen wanting to continue the argument
You declared I didnt know myself That I would have no selfcontrol I
will

I meant the big things of life he said patiently

What things

I told you By askin what had never happened to you I learned what
will happen

Those experiences to come to ME breathed Helen incredulously
Never

Sister Nell they sure willparticularly the lastnamed onethe mad
love chimed in Bo mischievously yet believingly

Neither Dale nor Helen appeared to hear her interruption

Let me put it simpler began Dale evidently racking his brain for
analogy His perplexity appeared painful to him because he had a great
faith a great conviction that he could not make clear Here I am
the natural physical man livin in the wilds An here you come the
complex intellectual woman Remember for my arguments sake that
youre here An suppose circumstances forced you to stay here Youd
fight the elements with me an work with me to sustain life There
must be a great change in either you or me accordin to the others
influence An cant you see that change must come in you not because
of anythin superior in meIm really inferior to youbut because of
our environment Youd lose your complexity An in years to come youd
be a natural physical woman because youd live through an by the
physical

Oh dear will not education be of help to the Western woman queried
Helen almost in despair

Sure it will answered Dale promptly What the West needs is women
who can raise an teach children But you dont understand me You dont
get under your skin I reckon I cant make you see my argument as I feel
it You take my word for this though Sooner or later you WILL wake up
an forget yourself Remember

Nell Ill bet you do too said Bo seriously for her It may seem
strange to you but I understand Dale I feel what he means Its a sort
of shock Nell were not what we seem Were not what we fondly imagine
we are Weve lived too long with peopletoo far away from the earth
You know the Bible says something like this Dust thou art and to dust
thou shalt return Where DO we come from



CHAPTER XII

Days passed

Every morning Helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this
day would bring forth especially with regard to possible news from her
uncle It must come sometime and she was anxious for it Something about
this simple wild camp life had begun to grip her She found herself
shirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought West They
needed it but she had begun to see how superficial they really were
On the other hand campfire tasks had come to be a pleasure She had
learned a great deal more about them than had Bo Worry and dread
were always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughtsalways vaguely
present though seldom annoying They were like shadows in dreams She
wanted to get to her uncles ranch to take up the duties of her new
life But she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild
experience She must get away from that in order to see it clearly and
she began to have doubts of herself

Meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on Bo leaned more
and more toward utter reconciliation to it Her eyes had a wonderful
flash like blue lightning her cheeks were gold and brown her hands
tanned dark as an Indians

She could vault upon the gray mustang or for that matter clear over
his back She learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win Dales
praise and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or
upon Snake Anson

Bo if you met that grizzly Dale said has been prowling round camp
lately youd run right up a tree declared Helen one morning when Bo
seemed particularly boastful

Dont fool yourself retorted Bo

But Ive seen you run from a mouse

Sister couldnt I be afraid of a mouse and not a bear

I dont see how

Well bears lions outlaws and other wild beasts are to be met with
here in the West and my minds made up said Bo in slownodding
deliberation

They argued as they had always argued Helen for reason and common sense
and restraint Bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better
to get in the first blow

The morning on which this argument took place Dale was a long time in
catching the horses When he did come in he shook his head seriously

Some varmints been chasin the horses he said as he reached for his
saddle Did you hear them snortin an runnin last night

Neither of the girls had been awakened

I missed one of the colts went on Dale an Im goin to ride across
the park

Dales movements were quick and stern It was significant that he chose
his heavier rifle and mounting with a sharp call to Pedro he rode
off without another word to the girls

Bo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang

You wont follow him asked Helen quickly

I sure will replied Bo He didnt forbid it

But he certainly did not want us

He might not want you but Ill bet he wouldnt object to me
whatevers up said Bo shortly

Oh So you think exclaimed Helen keenly hurt She bit her tongue to
keep back a hot reply And it was certain that a bursting gush of anger
flooded over her Was she then such a coward Did Dale think this
slip of a sister so wild and wilful was a stronger woman than she A
moments silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and
no doubt he was right Then the anger centered upon herself and Helen
neither understood nor trusted herself

The outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse Helen began to saddle her
horse She had the task half accomplished when Bos call made her look
up

Listen

Helen heard a ringing wild bay of the hound

Thats Pedro she said with a thrill

Sure Hes running We never heard him bay like that before

Wheres Dale

He rode out of sight across there replied Bo pointing And Pedros
running toward us along that slope He must be a miletwo miles from
Dale

But Dale will follow

Sure But hed need wings to get near that hound now Pedro couldnt
have gone across there with him just listen

The wild note of the hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible
action Snatching up Dales lighter rifle she shoved it into her
saddlesheath and leaping on the mustang she ran him over brush and
brook straight down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing For
an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech When Bo sailed over a big
log like a steeplechaser then Helen answered to further unconsidered
impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened Without coat or hat
she mounted The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the
saddle A strange trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins
She wanted to scream for Bo to wait Bo was out of sight but the deep
muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded
Helen an easy trail to follow In fact her horse needed no guiding He
ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park and
suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang
standing still Bo was looking up and listening

There he is cried Bo as the hound bayed ringingly closer to them
this time and she spurred away

Helens horse followed without urging He was excited His ears were up
Something was in the wind Helen had never ridden along this broken end
of the park and Bo was not easy to keep up with She led across bogs
brooks swales rocky little ridges through stretches of timber and
groves of aspen so thick Helen could scarcely squeeze through Then
Bo came out into a large open offshoot of the park right under the
mountain slope and here she sat her horse watching and listening
Helen rode up to her imagining once that she had heard the hound

Look Look Bos scream made her mustang stand almost straight up

Helen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering
across an opening on the slope

Its a grizzly Hell kill Pedro Oh where is Dale cried Bo with
intense excitement

Bo That bear is running down Wewe must getout of his road
panted Helen in breathless alarm

Dale hasnt had time to be close Oh I wish hed come I dont know
what to do

Ride back At least wait for him

Just then Pedro spoke differently in savage barks and following that
came a loud growl and crashings in the brush These sounds appeared to
be not far up the slope

Nell Do you hear Pedros fighting the bear burst out Bo Her face
paled her eyes flashed like blue steel The bear ll kill him

Oh that would be dreadful replied Helen in distress But what on
earth can we do

HELLO DALE called Bo at the highest pitch of her piercing voice

No answer came A heavy crash of brush a rolling of stones another
growl from the slope told Helen that the hound had brought the bear to
bay

Nell Im going up said Bo deliberately

Nono Are you mad returned Helen

The bear will kill Pedro

He might kill you

You ride that way and yell for Dale rejoined Bo

What willyou do gasped Helen

Ill shoot at the bearscare him off If he chases me he cant catch
me coming downhill Dale said that

Youre crazy cried Helen as Bo looked up the slope searching for
open ground Then she pulled the rifle from its sheath

But Bo did not hear or did not care She spurred the mustang and he
wild to run flung grass and dirt from his heels What Helen would have
done then she never knew but the fact was that her horse bolted after
the mustang In an instant seemingly Bo had disappeared in the gold
and green of the forest slope Helens mount climbed on a run snorting
and heaving through aspens brush and timber to come out into a
narrow long opening extending lengthwise up the slope

A sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed Helen and halted her horse She
saw a shaking of aspens Then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of
the woods It was a bear of enormous size Helens heart stoppedher
tongue clove to the roof of her mouth The bear turned His mouth was
open red and dripping He looked shaggy gray He let out a terrible
bawl Helens every muscle froze stiff Her horse plunged high and
sidewise wheeling almost in the air neighing his terror Like a stone
she dropped from the saddle She did not see the horse break into the
woods but she heard him Her gaze never left the bear even while she
was falling and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her
back against a bush It upheld her The bear wagged his huge head from
side to side Then as the hound barked close at hand he turned to run
heavily uphill and out of the opening

The instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for Helen Frozen
with horror she had been unable to move or feel or think All at once
she was a quivering mass of cold helpless flesh wet with perspiration
sick with a shuddering retching internal convulsion her mind
liberated from paralyzing shock The moment was as horrible as that
in which the bear had bawled his frightful rage A stark icy black
emotion seemed in possession of her She could not lift a hand yet all
of her body appeared shaking There was a fluttering a strangling in
her throat The crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before
she recovered use of her limbs Then the naked and terrible thing was
gone like a nightmare giving way to consciousness What blessed relief
Helen wildly gazed about her The bear and hound were out of sight and
so was her horse She stood up very dizzy and weak Thought of Bo then
seemed to revive her to shock different life and feeling throughout all
her cold extremities She listened

She heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope then Dales clear strong
call She answered It appeared long before he burst out of the woods
riding hard and leading her horse In that time she recovered fully
and when he reached her to put a sudden halt upon the fiery Ranger she
caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse The feel of
the saddle seemed different Dales piercing gray glance thrilled her
strangely

Youre white Are you hurt he said

No I was scared

But he threw you

Yes he certainly threw me

What happened

We heard the hound and we rode along the timber Then we saw the
beara monsterwhitecoated

I know Its a grizzly He killed the coltyour pet Hurry now What
about Bo

Pedro was fighting the bear Bo said hed be killed She rode right up
here My horse followed I couldnt have stopped him But we lost Bo
Right there the bear came out He roared My horse threw me and ran off
Pedros barking saved memy life I think Oh that was awful Then the
bear went upthere And you came

Bos followin the hound ejaculated Dale And lifting his hands to
his mouth he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope rang
against the cliffs pealed and broke and died away Then he waited
listening From far up the slope came a faint wild cry highpitched
and sweet to create strange echoes floating away to die in the
ravines

Shes after him declared Dale grimly

Bos got your rifle said Helen Oh we must hurry

You go back ordered Dale wheeling his horse

No Helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet

Dale spurred Ranger and took to the open slope Helen kept at his heels
until timber was reached Here a steep trail led up Dale dismounted

Horse tracksbear tracksdog tracks he said bending over Well
have to walk up here Itll save our horses an maybe time too

Is Bo riding up there asked Helen eying the steep ascent

She sure is With that Dale started up leading his horse Helen
followed It was rough and hard work She was lightly clad yet soon she
was hot laboring and her heart began to hurt When Dale halted to
rest Helen was just ready to drop The baying of the hound though
infrequent inspirited her But presently that sound was lost Dale said
bear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained
he would hear them again

Look there he said presently pointing to fresh tracks larger than
those made by Bos mustang Elk tracks Weve scared a big bull an
hes right ahead of us Look sharp an youll see him

Helen never climbed so hard and fast before and when they reached the
ridgetop she was all tuckered out It was all she could do to get on
her horse Dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the
western end which was considerably higher In places open rocky ground
split the green timber Dale pointed toward a promontory

Helen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky He was a light
gray over all his hindquarters with shoulders and head black His
ponderous widespread antlers towered over him adding to the wildness
of his magnificent poise as he stood there looking down into the
valley no doubt listening for the bay of the hound When he heard
Dales horse he gave one bound gracefully and wonderfully carrying his
antlers to disappear in the green

Again on a bare patch of ground Dale pointed down Helen saw big round
tracks toeing in a little that gave her a chill She knew these were
grizzly tracks

Hard riding was not possible on this ridge crest a fact that gave Helen
time to catch her breath At length coming out upon the very summit
of the mountain Dale heard the hound Helens eyes feasted afar upon
a wild scene of rugged grandeur before she looked down on this western
slope at her feet to see bare gradual descent leading down to sparsely
wooded bench and on to deepgreen canuon

Ride hard now yelled Dale I see Bo an Ill have to ride to catch
her

Dale spurred down the slope Helen rode in his tracks and though she
plunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright she saw him
draw away from her Sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a
few yards and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the
stirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down She let him choose
the way while she gazed ahead at Dale and then farther on in the hope
of seeing Bo At last she was rewarded Far Down the wooded bench she
saw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of Bos hair
Her heart swelled Dale would soon overhaul Bo and come between her and
peril And on the instant though Helen was unconscious of it then
a remarkable change came over her spirit Fear left her And a hot
exalting incomprehensible something took possession of her

She let the horse run and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope
of soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made
the wind bite Helens cheeks and roar in her ears She lost sight of
Dale It gave her a strange grim exultance She bent her eager gaze to
find the tracks of his horse and she found them Also she made out the
tracks of Bos mustang and the bear and the hound Her horse scenting
game perhaps and afraid to be left alone settled into a fleet and
powerful stride sailing over logs and brush That open bench had looked
short but it was long and Helen rode down the gradual descent at
breakneck speed She would not be left behind She had awakened to a
heedlessness of risk Something burned steadily within her A grim hard
anger of joy When she saw far down another open gradual descent that
Dale had passed Bo and that Bo was riding the little mustang as never
before then Helen flamed with a madness to catch her to beat her in
that wonderful chase to show her and Dale what there really was in the
depths of Helen Rayner

Her ambition was to be shortlived she divined from the lay of the land
ahead but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that
would always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance

The open ground was only too short That thundering pace soon brought
Helens horse to the timber Here it took all her strength to check his
headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jackpines Helen lost
sight of Bo and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from
getting lost She had to follow the trail and in some places it was
hard to see from horseback

Besides her horse was mettlesome thoroughly aroused and he wanted a
free rein and his own way Helen tried that only to lose the trail and
to get sundry knocks from trees and branches She could not hear the
hound nor Dale The pines were small close together and tough They
were hard to bend Helen hurt her hands scratched her face barked her
knees The horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he
liked instead of the way Helen guided him and when he plunged between
saplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on
her That did not make any difference to Helen Once worked into a
frenzy her blood stayed at high pressure She did not argue with
herself about a need of desperate hurry Even a blow on the head that
nearly blinded her did not in the least retard her The horse could
hardly be held and not at all in the few open places

At last Helen reached another slope Coming out upon canuon rim she
heard Dales clear call far down and Bos answering peal high and
piercing with its note of exultant wildness Helen also heard the bear
and the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon

Here Helen again missed the tracks made by Dale and Bo The descent
looked impassable She rode back along the rim then forward Finally
she found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs down over
little banks Helens horse balked at these jumps When she goaded him
over them she went forward on his neck It seemed like riding straight
downhill The mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to
Helen as the obstacles grew Then once more the bay of the hound and
the bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse He snorted a shrill
defiance He plunged with fore hoofs in the air He slid and broke a way
down the steep soft banks through the thick brush and thick clusters
of saplings sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him
He fell over one bank but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he
rebounded and gained his feet The sounds of fight ceased but Dales
thrilling call floated up on the pinescented air

Before Helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope in a narrow
canuonbed full of rocks and trees with a soft roar of running water
filling her ears Tracks were everywhere and when she came to the first
open place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into
the water Here he had fought Pedro Signs of that battle were easy to
read Helen saw where his huge tracks still wet led up the opposite
sandy bank

Then downstream Helen did some more reckless and splendid riding On
level ground the horse was great Once he leaped clear across the brook
Every plunge every turn Helen expected to come upon Dale and Bo facing
the bear The canuon narrowed the streambed deepened She had to slow
down to get through the trees and rocks Quite unexpectedly she rode
pellmell upon Dale and Bo and the panting Pedro Her horse plunged to a
halt answering the shrill neighs of the other horses

Dale gazed in admiring amazement at Helen

Say did you meet the bear again he queried blankly

No Didntyoukill him panted Helen slowly sagging in her saddle

He got away in the rocks Rough country down here

Helen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief
She saw that she was bloody dirty disheveled and wringing wet with
perspiration Her riding habit was torn into tatters Every muscle
seemed to burn and sting and all her bones seemed broken But it was
worth all this to meet Dales penetrating glance to see Bos utter
incredulous astonishment

NellRayner gasped Bo

Ifmy horse d beenany goodin the woods panted Helen Id not
lostso much timeriding down this mountain And Id caught youbeat
you

Girl did you RIDE down this last slope queried Dale

I sure did replied Helen smiling

We walked every step of the way and was lucky to get down at that
responded Dale gravely No horse should have been ridden down there
Why he must have slid down

We slidyes But I stayed on him

Bos incredulity changed to wondering speechless admiration And Dales
rare smile changed his gravity

Im sorry It was rash of me I thought youd go back But alls
well that ends well Helen did you wake up today

She dropped her eyes not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her

Maybea little she replied and she covered her face with her hands
Remembrance of his questionsof his assurance that she did not know
the real meaning of lifeof her stubborn antagonismmade her somehow
ashamed But it was not for long

The chase was great she said I did not know myself You were
right

In how many ways did you find me right he asked

I think allbut one she replied with a laugh and a shudder Im
near starved NOWI was so furious at Bo that I could have choked her I
faced that horrible brute Oh I know what it is to fear death I
was lost twice on the rideabsolutely lost Thats all

Bo found her tongue The last thing was for you to fall wildly in love
wasnt it

According to Dale I must add that to my new experiences of
todaybefore I can know real life replied Helen demurely

The hunter turned away Let us go he said soberly



CHAPTER XIII

After more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold
and purple park and dreamily listening by day to the everlow and
everchanging murmur of the waterfall and by night to the wild lonely
mourn of a hunting wolf and climbing to the dizzy heights where the
wind stung sweetly Helen Rayner lost track of time and forgot her
peril

Roy Beeman did not return If occasionally Dale mentioned Roy and his
quest the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the
old uncle and then they forgot again Paradise Park lived in a little
while at that season of the year would have claimed any one and ever
afterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams

Bo gave up to the wild life to the horses and rides to the many pets
and especially to the cougar Tom The big cat followed her everywhere
played with her rolling and pawing kittenlike and he would lay
his massive head in her lap to purr his content Bo had little fear of
anything and here in the wilds she soon lost that

Another of Dales pets was a halfgrown black bear named Muss He was
abnormally jealous of little Bud and he had a welldeveloped hatred
of Tom otherwise he was a very goodtempered bear and enjoyed Dales
impartial regard Tom however chased Muss out of camp whenever Dales
back was turned and sometimes Muss stayed away shifting for himself
With the advent of Bo who spent a good deal of time on the animals
Muss manifestly found the camp more attractive Whereupon Dale
predicted trouble between Tom and Muss

Bo liked nothing better than a roughandtumble frolic with the black
bear Muss was not very big nor very heavy and in a wrestling bout with
the strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best It spoke
well of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt Bo He never bit
or scratched though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws
Whereupon Bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in
earnest

One afternoon before the early supper they always had Dale and Helen
were watching Bo teasing the bear She was in her most vixenish mood
full of life and fight Tom lay his long length on the grass watching
with narrow gleaming eyes

When Bo and Muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and
over Dale called Helens attention to the cougar

Toms jealous Its strange how animals are like people Pretty soon
Ill have to corral Muss or therell be a fight

Helen could not see anything wrong with Tom except that he did not look
playful

During suppertime both bear and cougar disappeared though this was not
remarked until afterward Dale whistled and called but the rival pets
did not return Next morning Tom was there curled up snugly at the foot
of Bos bed and when she arose he followed her around as usual But
Muss did not return

The circumstance made Dale anxious He left camp taking Tom with him
and upon returning stated that he had followed Musss track as far as
possible and then had tried to put Tom on the trail but the cougar
would not or could not follow it Dale said Tom never liked a bear
trail anyway cougars and bears being common enemies So whether by
accident or design Bo lost one of her playmates

The hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one
of the mountains He did not discover any sign of Muss but he said he
had found something else

Bo you girls want some more real excitement he asked

Helen smiled her acquiescence and Bo replied with one of her forceful
speeches

Dont mind bein good an scared he went on

You cant scare me bantered Bo But Helen looked doubtful

Up in one of the parks I ran across one of my horsesa lame bay you
havent seen Well he had been killed by that old silvertip The one we
chased Hadnt been dead over an hour Blood was still runnin an only
a little meat eaten That bear heard me or saw me an made off into the
woods But hell come back tonight Im goin up there lay for him
an kill him this time Reckon youd better go because I dont want to
leave you here alone at night

Are you going to take Tom asked Bo

No The bear might get his scent An besides Tom aint reliable on
bears Ill leave Pedro home too

When they had hurried supper and Dale had gotten in the horses the sun
had set and the valley was shadowing low down while the ramparts were
still golden The long zigzag trail Dale followed up the slope took
nearly an hour to climb so that when that was surmounted and he led
out of the woods twilight had fallen A rolling park extended as far as
Helen could see bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling
stretches of trees Here and there like islands were isolated patches
of timber

At ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night
was a rich and rare atmospheric effect It looked as if it was seen
through perfectly clear smoked glass Objects were singularly visible
even at long range and seemed magnified In the west where the
afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark ragged sprucespeared
horizonline there was such a transparent golden line melting into
vivid starfired blue that Helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering
admiration

Dale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls
kept up with him The ground was rough with tufts of grass growing
close together yet the horses did not stumble Their action and
snorting betrayed excitement Dale led around several clumps of timber
up a long grassy swale and then straight westward across an open flat
toward where the darkfringed forestline raised itself wild and clear
against the cold sky The horses went swiftly and the wind cut like a
blade of ice Helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she
had just climbed a laborsome hill The stars began to blink out of the
blue and the gold paled somewhat and yet twilight lingered It seemed
long across that flat but really was short Coming to a thin line of
trees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch
of woods Dale dismounted and tied his horse When the girls got off he
haltered their horses also

Stick close to me an put your feet down easy he whispered How tall
and dark he loomed in the fading light Helen thrilled as she had often
of late at the strange potential force of the man Stepping softly
without the least sound Dale entered this straggly bit of woods which
appeared to have narrow byways and nooks Then presently he came to
the top of a wellwooded slope dark as pitch apparently But as Helen
followed she perceived the trees and they were thin dwarf spruce
partly dead The slope was soft and springy easy to step upon without
noise Dale went so cautiously that Helen could not hear him and
sometimes in the gloom she could not see him Then the chill thrills ran
over her Bo kept holding on to Helen which fact hampered Helen as
well as worked somewhat to disprove Bos boast At last level ground was
reached Helen made out a lightgray background crossed by black bars
Another glance showed this to be the dark treetrunks against the open
park

Dale halted and with a touch brought Helen to a straining pause He was
listening It seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as
silent and motionless as one of the dark trees

Hes not there yet Dale whispered and he stepped forward very
slowly Helen and Bo began to come up against thin dead branches that
were invisible and then cracked Then Dale knelt down seemed to melt
into the ground

Youll have to crawl he whispered

How strange and thrilling that was for Helen and hard work The ground
bore twigs and dead branches which had to be carefully crawled over
and lying flat as was necessary it took prodigious effort to drag her
body inch by inch Like a huge snake Dale wormed his way along

Gradually the wood lightened They were nearing the edge of the park
Helen now saw a strip of open with a high black wall of spruce beyond
The afterglow flashed or changed like a dimming northern light and
then failed Dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two
treetrunks at the edge of the wood

Come up beside me he whispered

Helen crawled on and presently Bo was beside her panting with pale
face and great staring eyes plain to be seen in the wan light

Moons comin up Were just in time The old grizzlys not there yet
but I see coyotes Look

Dale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch
standing apart some little distance from the black wall

Thats the dead horse whispered Dale An if you watch close you can
see the coyotes Theyre gray an they move Cant you hear them

Helens excited ears so full of throbs and imaginings presently
registered low snaps and snarls Bo gave her arm a squeeze

I hear them Theyre fighting Oh gee she panted and drew a long
full breath of unutterable excitement

Keep quiet now an watch an listen said the hunter

Slowly the black ragged forestline seemed to grow blacker and lift
slowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence
slowly the stars paled and the sky filled over Somewhere the moon was
rising And slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer

Through the tips of the spruce now seen to be rather close at hand
shone a slender silver crescent moon darkening hiding shining again
climbing until its exquisite sicklepoint topped the trees and then
magically it cleared them radiant and cold While the eastern black
wall shaded still blacker the park blanched and the borderline
opposite began to stand out as trees

Look Look cried Bo very low and fearfully as she pointed

Not so loud whispered Dale

But I see something

Keep quiet he admonished

Helen in the direction Bo pointed could not see anything but
moonblanched bare ground rising close at hand to a little ridge

Lie still whispered Dale Im goin to crawl around to get a look
from another angle Ill be right back

He moved noiselessly backward and disappeared With him gone Helen felt
a palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin

Oh my Nell Look whispered Bo in fright I know I saw something

On top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly getting farther
out into the light Helen watched with suspended breath It moved out
to be silhouetted against the skyapparently a huge round bristling
animal frosty in color One instant it seemed hugethe next
smallthen close at handand far away It swerved to come directly
toward them Suddenly Helen realized that the beast was not a dozen
yards distant She was just beginning a new experiencea real
and horrifying terror in which her blood curdled her heart gave a
tremendous leap and then stood still and she wanted to fly but was
rooted to the spotwhen Dale returned to her side

Thats a pesky porcupine he whispered Almost crawled over you He
sure would have stuck you full of quills

Whereupon he threw a stick at the animal It bounced straight up to turn
round with startling quickness and it gave forth a rattling sound then
it crawled out of sight

Porcupine whispered Bo pantingly It mightas wellhave
beenan elephant

Helen uttered a long eloquent sigh She would not have cared to
describe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog

Listen warned Dale very low His big hand closed over Helens
gauntleted one There you havethe real cry of the wild

Sharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf distant yet
wonderfully distinct How wild and mournful and hungry How marvelously
pure Helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its
music the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused Again
a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life back into the dim
remote past from which she had come

The cry was not repeated The coyotes were still And silence fell
absolutely unbroken

Dale nudged Helen and then reached over to give Bo a tap He was
peering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt Helen
looked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the
coyotes skulk away out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods
where they disappeared Not only Dales intensity but the very silence
the wildness of the moment and place seemed fraught with wonderful
potency Bo must have felt it too for she was trembling all over and
holding tightly to Helen and breathing quick and fast

Ahuh muttered Dale under his breath

Helen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation and she
divined then something of what the moment must have been to a hunter

Then her roving alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow
coming out of the forest It moved but surely that huge thing could not
be a bear It passed out of gloom into silver moonlight Helens heart
bounded For it was a great frostycoated bear lumbering along toward
the dead horse Instinctively Helens hand sought the arm of the hunter
It felt like iron under a rippling surface The touch eased away the
oppression over her lungs the tightness of her throat What must have
been fear left her and only a powerful excitement remained A sharp
expulsion of breath from Bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs
that she had sighted the grizzly

In the moonlight he looked of immense size and that wild park with
the gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him Helens
quick mind so taken up with emotion still had a thought for the wonder
and the meaning of that scene She wanted the bear killed yet that
seemed a pity

He had a wagging rolling slow walk which took several moments to reach
his quarry When at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs
plainly heard and then a cross growl Evidently he had discovered that
his meal had been messed over As a whole the big bear could be seen
distinctly but only in outline and color The distance was perhaps two
hundred yards Then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass
Indeed he was dragging it very slowly but surely

Look at that whispered Dale If he aint strong Reckon Ill have
to stop him

The grizzly however stopped of his own accord just outside of the
shadowline of the forest Then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his
prey and began to tear and rend

Jess was a mighty good horse muttered Dale grimly too good to make
a meal for a hog silvertip

Then the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position swinging the
rifle in front of him He glanced up into the low branches of the tree
overhead

Girls theres no tellin what a grizzly will do If I yell you climb
up in this tree an do it quick

With that he leveled the rifle resting his left elbow on his knee The
front end of the rifle reaching out of the shade shone silver in the
moonlight Man and weapon became still as stone Helen held her breath
But Dale relaxed lowering the barrel

Cant see the sights very well he whispered shaking his head
Remember nowif I yell you climb

Again he aimed and slowly grew rigid Helen could not take her
fascinated eyes off him He knelt bareheaded and in the shadow she
could make out the gleam of his clearcut profile stern and cold

A streak of fire and a heavy report startled her Then she heard the
bullet hit Shifting her glance she saw the bear lurch with convulsive
action rearing on his hind legs Loud clicking snaps must have been a
clashing of his jaws in rage But there was no other sound Then again
Dales heavy gun boomed Helen heard again that singular spatting thud
of striking lead The bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt
a terrific blow But just as quickly he was up on allfours and began
to whirl with hoarse savage bawls of agony and fury His action quickly
carried him out of the moonlight into the shadow where he disappeared
There the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls and crashings in the
brush and snapping of branches as he made his way into the forest

Sure hes mad said Dale rising to his feet An I reckon hard hit
But I wont follow him tonight

Both the girls got up and Helen found she was shaky on her feet and
very cold

Ohh wasntitwonwonderful cried Bo

Are you scared Your teeth are chatterin queried Dale

Imcold

Well it sure is cold all right he responded Now the funs over
youll feel it Nell youre froze too

Helen nodded She was indeed as cold as she had ever been before But
that did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened
pulse the cause of which she did not conjecture

Lets rustle said Dale and led the way out of the wood and skirted
its edge around to the slope There they climbed to the flat and went
through the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered

Up here the wind began to blow not hard through the forest but still
strong and steady out in the open and bitterly cold Dale helped Bo to
mount and then Helen

Imnumb she said Ill fall offsure

No Youll be warm in a jiffy he replied because well ride some
goin back Let Ranger pick the way an you hang on

With Rangers first jump Helens blood began to run Out he shot his
lean dark head beside Dales horse The wild park lay clear and bright
in the moonlight with strange silvery radiance on the grass The
patches of timber like spired black islands in a moonblanched lake
seemed to harbor shadows and places for bears to hide ready to spring
out As Helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart
beat Half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold And all seemed
gloriousthe sailing moon white in a darkblue sky the white
passionless stars so solemn so far away the beckoning fringe of
forestland at once mysterious and friendly and the fleet horses
running with soft rhythmic thuds over the grass leaping the ditches
and the hollows making the bitter wind sting and cut Coming up
that park the ride had been long going back was as short as it was
thrilling In Helen experiences gathered realization slowly and it
was this swift ride the horses neck and neck and all the wildness and
beauty that completed the slow insidious work of years The tears
of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full All that
pertained to this night got into her blood It was only to feel to live
now but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward

Dales horse a little in advance sailed over a ditch Ranger made a
splendid leap but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell Helen
shot over his head She struck lengthwise her arms stretched and slid
hard to a shocking impact that stunned her

Bos scream rang in her ears she felt the wet grass under her face and
then the strong hands that lifted her Dale loomed over her bending
down to look into her face Bo was clutching her with frantic hands And
Helen could only gasp Her breast seemed caved in The need to breathe
was torture

Nellyoure not hurt You fell light like a feather All grass
here You cant be hurt said Dale sharply

His anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing and his strong hands
went swiftly over her arms and shoulders feeling for broken bones

Just had the wind knocked out of you went on Dale It feels awful
but its nothin

Helen got a little air that was like hot pinpoints in her lungs and
then a deeper breath and then full gasping respiration

I guessIm not hurtnot a bit she choked out

You sure had a header Never saw a prettier spill Ranger doesnt do
that often I reckon we were travelin too fast But it was fun dont
you think

It was Bo who answered Oh glorious But gee I was scared

Dale still held Helens hands She released them while looking up at
him The moment was realization for her of what for days had been a
vague sweet uncertainty becoming near and strange disturbing and
present This accident had been a sudden violent end to the wonderful
ride But its effect the knowledge of what had got into her blood
would never change And inseparable from it was this man of the forest



CHAPTER XIV

On the next morning Helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a
dream of some one shouting With a start she sat up The sunshine showed
pink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims Bo was on
her knees braiding her hair with shaking hands and at the same time
trying to peep out

And the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs That
had been Dales voice

Nell Nell Wake up called Bo wildly Oh some ones come Horses
and men

Helen got to her knees and peered out over Bos shoulder Dale standing
tall and striking beside the campfire was waving his sombrero Away
down the open edge of the park came a string of packburros with mounted
men behind In the foremost rider Helen recognized Roy Beeman

That first ones Roy she exclaimed Id never forget him on a
horse Bo it must mean Uncle Als come

Sure Were born lucky Here we are safe and soundand all this grand
camp trip Look at the cowboys LOOK Oh maybe this isnt great
babbled Bo

Dale wheeled to see the girls peeping out

Its time youre up he called Your uncle Al is here

For an instant after Helen sank back out of Dales sight she sat there
perfectly motionless so struck was she by the singular tone of Dales
voice She imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of
horsemen meantthey had come to take her to her ranch in Pine Helens
heart suddenly began to beat fast but thickly as if muffled within her
breast

Hurry now girls called Dale

Bo was already out kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook
splashing water in a great hurry Helens hands trembled so that she
could scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair and she was long behind
Bo in making herself presentable When Helen stepped out a short
powerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding Bos
hands

Wal wal You favor the Rayners he was saying I remember your dad
an a fine feller he was

Beside them stood Dale and Roy and beyond was a group of horses and
riders

Uncle here comes Nell said Bo softly

Aw The old cattleman breathed hard as he turned

Helen hurried She had not expected to remember this uncle but one look
into the brown beaming face with the blue eyes flashing yet sad and
she recognized him at the same instant recalling her mother

He held out his arms to receive her

Nell Auchincloss all over again he exclaimed in deep voice as he
kissed her Id have knowed you anywhere

Uncle Al murmured Helen I remember youthough I was only four

Wal walthats fine he replied I remember you straddled my knee
once an your hair was brighteran curly It aint neither now
Sixteen years An youre twenty now What a fine broadshouldered girl
you are An Nell youre the handsomest Auchincloss I ever seen

Helen found herself blushing and withdrew her hands from his as Roy
stepped forward to pay his respects He stood bareheaded lean and tall
with neither his clear eyes nor his still face nor the proffered hand
expressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity of achievement
that Helen sensed in him

Howdy Miss Helen Howdy Bo he said You all both look fine an
brown I reckon I was shore slow rustlin your uncle Al up here But
I was figgerin youd like Milts camp for a while

We sure did replied Bo archly

Aw breathed Auchincloss heavily Lemme set down

He drew the girls to the rustic seat Dale had built for them under the
big pine

Oh you must be tired Howhow are you asked Helen anxiously

Tired Wal if I am its jest this here minit When Joe Beeman rode
in on me with thet news of youwal I jest fergot I was a wornout old
hoss Havent felt so good in years Mebbe two such young an pretty
nieces will make a new man of me

Uncle Al you look strong and well to me said Bo And young too
and

Haw Haw Thet ll do interrupted Al I see through you What youll
do to Uncle Al will be aplenty Yes girls Im feelin fine But
strangestrange Mebbe thets my joy at seein you safesafe when I
feared so thet damned greaser Beasley

In Helens grave gaze his face changed swiftlyand all the serried
years of toil and battle and privation showed with something that was
not age nor resignation yet as tragic as both

Wal never mind himnow he added slowly and the warmer light
returned to his face Dalecome here

The hunter stepped closer

I reckon I owe you more n I can ever pay said Auchincloss with an
arm around each niece

No Al you dont owe me anythin returned Dale thoughtfully as he
looked away

Ahuh grunted Al You hear him girls Now listen you wild
hunter An you girls listen Milt I never thought you much good
cept for the wilds But I reckon Ill have to swallow thet I do
Comin to me as you didan after bein druv offkeepin your council
an savin my girls from thet holdup wal its the biggest deal any
man ever did for me An Im ashamed of my hard feelins an heres
my hand

Thanks Al replied Dale with his fleeting smile and he met the
proffered hand Now will you be makin camp here

Wal no Ill rest a little an you can pack the girls outfitthen
well go Sure youre goin with us

Ill call the girls to breakfast replied Dale and he moved away
without answering Auchinclosss query

Helen divined that Dale did not mean to go down to Pine with them and
the knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise Had she expected him
to go

Come here Jeff called Al to one of his men

A short bowlegged horseman with dusty garb and sunbleached face
hobbled forth from the group He was not young but he had a boyish grin
and bright little eyes Awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero

Jeff shake hands with my nieces said Al This s Helen an your
boss from now on An this s Bo fer short Her name was Nancy but
when she lay a baby in her cradle I called her BoPeep an the names
stuck Girls this heres my foreman Jeff Mulvey whos been with me
twenty years

The introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals
particularly to Jeff

Jeff throw the packs an saddles fer a rest was Als order to his
foreman

Nell reckon youll have fun bossin thet outfit chuckled Al None
of ems got a wife Lot of scalawags they are no women would have
them

Uncle I hope Ill never have to be their boss replied Helen

Wal youre goin to be right off declared Al They aint a bad
lot after all An I got a likely new man

With that he turned to Bo and after studying her pretty face
he asked in apparently severe tone Did you send a cowboy named
Carmichael to ask me for a job

Bo looked quite startled

Carmichael Why Uncle I never heard that name before replied Bo
bewilderedly

Ahuh Reckoned the young rascal was lyin said Auchincloss But I
liked the fellars looks an so let him stay

Then the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders

Las Vegas come here he ordered in a loud voice

Helen thrilled at sight of a tall superbly built cowboy reluctantly
detaching himself from the group He had a redbronze face young like a
boys Helen recognized it and the flowing red scarf and the swinging
gun and the slow spurclinking gait No other than Bos Las Vegas
cowboy admirer

Then Helen flashed a look at Bo which look gave her a delicious
almost irresistible desire to laugh That young lady also recognized the
reluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face Helen
recorded her first experience of Bos utter discomfiture Bo turned
white then red as a rose

Say my niece said she never heard of the name Carmichael declared
Al severely as the cowboy halted before him Helen knew her uncle had
the repute of dealing hard with his men but here she was reassured and
pleased at the twinkle in his eye

Shore boss I cant help thet drawled the cowboy Its good old
Texas stock

He did not appear shamefaced now but just as cool easy cleareyed
and lazy as the day Helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze

Texas You fellars from the Pan Handle are always hollerin Texas
I never seen thet Texans had any one else beatsay from Missouri
returned Al testily

Carmichael maintained a discreet silence and carefully avoided looking
at the girls

Wal reckon well all call you Las Vegas anyway continued the
rancher Didnt you say my niece sent you to me for a job

Whereupon Carmichaels easy manner vanished

Now boss shore my memorys pore he said I only says

Dont tell me thet My memorys not pore replied Al mimicking
the drawl What you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for
you

Here Carmichael stole a timid glance at Bo the result of which was
to render him utterly crestfallen Not improbably he had taken Bos
expression to mean something it did not for Helen read it as a mingling
of consternation and fright Her eyes were big and blazing a red spot
was growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion

Well didnt you demanded Al

From the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of
his employ it seemed to Helen that they were having fun at Carmichaels
expense

Yes sir I did suddenly replied the cowboy

Ahuh All right heres my niece Now see thet she speaks the good
word

Carmichael looked at Bo and Bo looked at him Their glances were
strange wondering and they grew shy Bo dropped hers The cowboy
apparently forgot what had been demanded of him

Helen put a hand on the old ranchers arm

Uncle what happened was my fault she said The train stopped at Las
Vegas This young man saw us at the open window He must have guessed we
were lonely homesick girls getting lost in the West For he spoke to
usnice and friendly He knew of you And he asked in what I took
for fun if we thought you would give him a job And I replied just to
tease Bo that she would surely speak a good word for him

Haw Haw So thets it replied Al and he turned to Bo with merry
eyes Wal I kept this here Las Vegas Carmichael on his sayso Come on
with your good word unless you want to see him lose his job

Bo did not grasp her uncles bantering because she was seriously gazing
at the cowboy But she had grasped something

Hehe was the first personout Westto speak kindly to us she
said facing her uncle

Wal thets a pretty good word but it aint enough responded Al

Subdued laughter came from the listening group Carmichael shifted from
side to side

Hehe looks as if he might ride a horse well ventured Bo

Best hossman I ever seen agreed Al heartily

Andand shoot added Bo hopefully

Bo he packs thet gun low like Jim Wilson an all them Texas
gunfighters Reckon thet aint no good word

ThenIll vouch for him said Bo with finality

Thet settles it Auchincloss turned to the cowboy Las Vegas youre
a stranger to us But youre welcome to a place in the outfit an I hope
you wont never disappoint us

Auchinclosss tone passing from jest to earnest betrayed to Helen the
old ranchers need of new and true men and hinted of trying days to
come

Carmichael stood before Bo sombrero in hand rolling it round and
round manifestly bursting with words he could not speak And the girl
looked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes
Helen saw in the moment more than that little byplay of confusion

MissMiss RaynerI shoream obliged he stammered presently

Youre very welcome she replied softly II got on the next
train he added

When he said that Bo was looking straight at him but she seemed not to
have heard

Whats your name suddenly she asked

Carmichael

I heard that But didnt uncle call you Las Vegas

Shore But it wasnt my fault Thet cowpunchin outfit saddled it on
me right off They Dont know no better Shore I jest wont answer to
thet handle NowMiss Bomy real name is Tom

I simply could not call youany name but Las Vegas replied Bo very
sweetly

Butbeggin your pardonII dont like thet blustered Carmichael

People often get called namesthey dont like she said with deep
intent

The cowboy blushed scarlet Helen as well as he got Bos inference to
that last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was
leaving Las Vegas She also sensed something of the disaster in store
for Mr Carmichael Just then the embarrassed young man was saved by
Dales call to the girls to come to breakfast

That meal the last for Helen in Paradise Park gave rise to a strange
and inexplicable restraint She had little to say Bo was in the highest
spirits teasing the pets joking with her uncle and Roy and even
poking fun at Dale The hunter seemed somewhat somber Roy was his usual
dry genial self And Auchincloss who sat near by was an interested
spectator When Tom put in an appearance lounging with his feline grace
into the camp as if he knew he was a privileged pet the rancher could
scarcely contain himself

Dale its thet damn cougar he ejaculated

Sure thats Tom

He ought to be corralled or chained Ive no use for cougars
protested Al

Tom is as tame an safe as a kitten

Ahuh Wal you tell thet to the girls if you like But not me Im an
old hoss I am

Uncle Al Tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed said Bo

Awwhat

Honest Injun she responded Well isnt it so

Helen smilingly nodded her corroboration Then Bo called Tom to her and
made him lie with his head on his stretched paws right beside her and
beg for bits to eat

Wal Id never have believed thet exclaimed Al shaking his big head
Dale its one on me Ive had them big cats foller me on the trails
through the woods moonlight an dark An Ive heard em let out thet
awful cry They aint any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougars
Does this Tom ever let out one of them wails

Sometimes at night replied Dale

Wal excuse me Hope you dont fetch the yaller rascal down to Pine

I wont

Whatll you do with this menagerie

Dale regarded the rancher attentively Reckon Al Ill take care of
them

But youre goin down to my ranch

What for

Al scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter Wal aint
it customary to visit friends

Thanks Al Next time I ride down Pine wayin the spring
perhapsIll run over an see how you are

Spring ejaculated Auchincloss Then he shook his head sadly and a
faraway look filmed his eyes Reckon youd call some late

Al youll get well now These girlsnowtheyll cure you Reckon I
never saw you look so good

Auchincloss did not press his point farther at that time but after the
meal when the other men came to see Dales camp and pets Helens quick
ears caught the renewal of the subject

Im askin youwill you come Auchincloss said low and eagerly

No I wouldnt fit in down there replied Dale

Milt talk sense You cant go on forever huntin bear an tamin
cats protested the old rancher

Why not asked the hunter thoughtfully

Auchincloss stood up and shaking himself as if to ward off his testy
temper he put a hand on Dales arm

One reason is youre needed in Pine

How Who needs me

I do Im playin out fast An Beasleys my enemy The ranch an all I
got will go to Nell Thet ranch will have to be run by a man an HELD
by a man Do you savvy Its a big job An Im offerin to make you my
foreman right now

Al you sort of take my breath replied Dale An Im sure grateful
But the fact is even if I could handle the job II dont believe Id

Make yourself want to then Thet d soon come Youd get interested
This country will develop I seen thet years ago The government is
goin to chase the Apaches out of here Soon homesteaders will be
flockin in Big future Dale You want to get in now An

Here Auchincloss hesitated then spoke lower

An take your chance with the girl Ill be on your side

A slight vibrating start ran over Dales stalwart form

Alyoure plumb dotty he exclaimed

Dotty Me Dotty ejaculated Auchincloss Then he swore In a minit
Ill tell you what you are

But Al that talks sosolike an old fools

Huh An why so

Because thatwonderful girl would never look at me Dale replied
simply

I seen her lookin already declared Al bluntly

Dale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless

Never mind thet went on Al Mebbe I am a dotty old foolspecially
for takin a shine to you But I say againwill you come down to Pine
and be my foreman

No replied Dale

Milt Ive no sonan Imafraid of Beasley This was uttered in an
agitated whisper

Al you make me ashamed said Dale hoarsely I cant come Ive no
nerve

Youve no what

Al I dont know whats wrong with me But Im afraid Id find out if I
came down there

Ahuh Its the girl

I dont know but Im afraid so An I wont come

Aw yes you will

Helen rose with beating heart and tingling ears and moved away out of
hearing She had listened too long to what had not been intended for her
ears yet she could not be sorry She walked a few rods along the brook
out from under the pines and standing in the open edge of the park
she felt the beautiful scene still her agitation The following
moments then were the happiest she had spent in Paradise Park and the
profoundest of her whole life

Presently her uncle called her

Nell this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss An I say you
take him

Ranger deserves better care than I can give him said Dale He runs
free in the woods most of the time Id be obliged if shed have him
An the hound Pedro too

Bo swept a saucy glance from Dale to her sister

Sure shell have Ranger Just offer him to ME

Dale stood there expectantly holding a blanket in his hand ready to
saddle the horse Carmichael walked around Ranger with that appraising
eye so keen in cowboys

Las Vegas do you know anything about horses asked Bo

Me Wal if you ever buy or trade a hoss you shore have me there
replied Carmichael

What do you think of Ranger went on Bo

Shore Id buy him sudden if I could

Mr Las Vegas youre too late asserted Helen as she advanced to lay
a hand on the horse

Ranger is mine

Dale smoothed out the blanket and folding it he threw it over the
horse and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place

Thank you very much for him said Helen softly

Youre welcome an Im sure glad responded Dale and then after a
few deft strong pulls at the straps he continued There hes ready
for you

With that he laid an arm over the saddle and faced Helen as she stood
patting and smoothing Ranger Helen strong and calm now in feminine
possession of her secret and his as well as her composure looked
frankly and steadily at Dale He seemed composed too yet the bronze of
his fine face was a trifle pale

But I cant thank youIll never be able to repay youfor your
service to me and my sister said Helen

I reckon you neednt try Dale returned An my service as you call
it has been good for me

Are you going down to Pine with us

No

But you will come soon

Not very soon I reckon he replied and averted his gaze

When

Hardly before spring

Spring That is a long time Wont you come to see me sooner than
that

If I can get down to Pine

Youre the first friend Ive made in the West said Helen earnestly

Youll make many morean I reckon soon forget him you called the man
of the forest

I never forget any of my friends And youve been thethe biggest
friend I ever had

Ill be proud to remember

But will you rememberwill you promise to come to Pine

I reckon

Thank you Alls well then My friend goodby

Goodby he said clasping her hand His glance was clear warm
beautiful yet it was sad

Auchinclosss hearty voice broke the spell Then Helen saw that the
others were mounted Bo had ridden up close her face was earnest
and happy and grieved all at once as she bade goodby to Dale The
packburros were hobbling along toward the green slope Helen was the
last to mount but Roy was the last to leave the hunter Pedro came
reluctantly

It was a merry singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail
under the dark spruces Helen assuredly was happy yet a pang abided in
her breast

She remembered that halfway up the slope there was a turn in the trail
where it came out upon an open bluff The time seemed long but at last
she got there And she checked Ranger so as to have a moments gaze down
into the park

It yawned there a darkgreen and brightgold gulf asleep under a
westering sun exquisite wild lonesome Then she saw Dale standing in
the open space between the pines and the spruces He waved to her And
she returned the salute

Roy caught up with her then and halted his horse He waved his sombrero
to Dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes
splitting strangely from cliff to cliff

Shore Milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome said Roy as if
thinking aloud But hell know now

Ranger stepped out of his own accord and turning off the ledge entered
the spruce forest Helen lost sight of Paradise Park For hours then
she rode along a shady fragrant trail seeing the beauty of color and
wildness hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water but all the
while her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had
thrilled herthat the hunter this strange man of the forest so deeply
versed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion aloof and simple and
strong like the elements which had developed him had fallen in love
with her and did not know it



CHAPTER XV

Dale stood with face and arm upraised and he watched Helen ride off the
ledge to disappear in the forest That vast spruce slope seemed to have
swallowed her She was gone Slowly Dale lowered his arm with gesture
expressive of a strange finality an eloquent despair of which he was
unconscious

He turned to the park to his camp and the many duties of a hunter The
park did not seem the same nor his home nor his work

I reckon this feelins natural he soliloquized resignedly but its
sure queer for me Thats what comes of makin friends Nell an Bo
now they made a difference an a difference I never knew before

He calculated that this difference had been simply one of
responsibility and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship
of girls and finally friendship These would pass now that the causes
were removed

Before he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come
but it was not the one anticipated Always before he had put his mind on
his tasks whatever they might be now he worked while his thoughts were
strangely involved

The little bear cub whined at his heels the tame deer seemed to regard
him with deep questioning eyes the big cougar padded softly here and
there as if searching for something

You all miss themnowI reckon said Dale Well theyre gone an
youll have to get along with me

Some vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him Presently
he grew both irritated and surprised with himselfa state of mind
totally unfamiliar Several times as old habit brought momentary
abstraction he found himself suddenly looking around for Helen and
Bo And each time the shock grew stronger They were gone but their
presence lingered After his camp chores were completed he went over to
pull down the leanto which the girls had utilized as a tent The spruce
boughs had dried out brown and sear the wind had blown the roof awry
the sides were leaning in As there was now no further use for
this little habitation he might better pull it down Dale did not
acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many
times Therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it

For the first time since Roy and he had built the leanto he stepped
inside Nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a
strange sensation perfectly incomprehensible to him The blankets
lay there on the spruce boughs disarranged and thrown back by hurried
hands yet still holding something of round folds where the slender
forms had nestled A black scarf often worn by Bo lay covering the
pillow of pineneedles a red ribbon that Helen had worn on her hair
hung from a twig These articles were all that had been forgotten Dale
gazed at them attentively then at the blankets and all around the
fragrant little shelter and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable
knowledge that he could not destroy the place where Helen and Bo had
spent so many hours

Whereupon in studious mood Dale took up his rifle and strode out to
hunt His winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in Action
suited his mood he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck
to slay which seemed murder at last he jumped one that was wild and
bounded away This he shot and set himself a Herculean task in packing
the whole carcass back to camp Burdened thus he staggered under the
trees sweating freely many times laboring for breath aching with
toil until at last he had reached camp There he slid the deer carcass
off his shoulders and standing over it he gazed down while his breast
labored It was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen But
neither in stalking it nor making a wonderful shot nor in packing home
a weight that would have burdened two men nor in gazing down at his
beautiful quarry did Dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter

Im a little off my feed he mused as he wiped sweat from his heated
face Maybe a little dotty as I called Al But thatll pass

Whatever his state it did not pass As of old after a long days hunt
he reclined beside the campfire and watched the golden sunset glows
change on the ramparts as of old he laid a hand on the soft furry head
of the pet cougar as of old he watched the gold change to red and then
to dark and twilight fall like a blanket as of old he listened to
the dreamy lulling murmur of the water fall The old familiar beauty
wildness silence and loneliness were there but the old content seemed
strangely gone

Soberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls
He did not distinguish Helen from Bo in his slow introspection When
he sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep Always after a
few moments of wakefulness while the silence settled down or the wind
moaned through the pines he had fallen asleep This night he found
different Though he was tired sleep would not soon come The
wilderness the mountains the park the campall seemed to have lost
something Even the darkness seemed empty And when at length Dale fell
asleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams

Up with the keenedged steelybright dawn he went at the his tasks
with the springy stride of the deerstalker

At the end of that strenuous day which was singularly full of the old
excitement and action and danger and of new observations he was bound
to confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him

Many times on the heights that day with the wind keen in his face and
the vast green billows of spruce below him he had found that he was
gazing without seeing halting without object dreaming as he had never
dreamed before

Once when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and whistling
a challenge to invisible rivals stood there a target to stir any
hunters pulse Dale did not even raise his rifle Into his ear just
then rang Helens voice Milt Dale you are no Indian Giving yourself
to a hunters wildlife is selfish It is wrong You love this lonely
life but it is not work Work that does not help others is not a real
mans work

From that moment conscience tormented him It was not what he loved
but what he ought to do that counted in the sum of good achieved in the
world Old Al Auchincloss had been right Dale was wasting strength and
intelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the
West Now that he had reached maturity if through his knowledge of
natures law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for
existence for place for possession and to hold them in contempt that
was no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them from some work
that was needed in an incomprehensible world

Dale did not hate work but he loved freedom To be alone to live with
nature to feel the elements to labor and dream and idle and climb
and sleep unhampered by duty by worry by restriction by the petty
interests of menthis had always been his ideal of living Cowboys
riders sheepherders farmersthese toiled on from one place and
one job to another for the little money doled out to them Nothing
beautiful nothing significant had ever existed in that for him He had
worked as a boy at every kind of rangework and of all that humdrum
waste of effort he had liked sawing wood best Once he had quit a job
of branding cattle because the smell of burning hide the bawl of the
terrified calf had sickened him If men were honest there would be no
need to scar cattle He had never in the least desired to own land and
droves of stock and make deals with ranchmen deals advantageous to
himself Why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a
piece of work to another mans disadvantage Selfpreservation was the
first law of life But as the plants and trees and birds and beasts
interpreted that law merciless and inevitable as they were they had
neither greed nor dishonesty They lived by the grand rule of what was
best for the greatest number

But Dales philosophy cold and clear and inevitable like nature
itself began to be pierced by the human appeal in Helen Rayners words
What did she mean Not that he should lose his love of the wilderness
but that he realize himself Many chance words of that girl had depth
He was young strong intelligent free from taint of disease or the
fever of drink He could do something for others Who If that mattered
there for instance was poor old Mrs Cass aged and lame now there
was Al Auchincloss dying in his boots afraid of enemies and wistful
for his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors there
were the two girls Helen and Bo new and strange to the West about to
be confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests Dale
thought of still more people in the little village of Pineof others
who had failed whose lives were hard who could have been made happier
by kindness and assistance

What then was the duty of Milt Dale to himself Because men preyed on
one another and on the weak should he turn his back upon a socalled
civilization or should he grow like them Clear as a bell came the
answer that his duty was to do neither And then he saw how the little
village of Pine as well as the whole world needed men like him He had
gone to nature to the forest to the wilderness for his development
and all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of
that education

Thus Dale lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park arrived
at a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle

It took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that
struggle but at length it evolved into the paradox that Helen Rayner
had opened his eyes to his duty as a man that he accepted it yet found
a strange obstacle in the perplexing tumultuous sweet fear of ever
going near her again

Suddenly then all his thought revolved around the girl and thrown
off his balance he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange
ideas

When he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest In his sleep his
mind had been active The idea that greeted him beautiful as the
sunrise flashed in memory of Auchinclosss significant words Take
your chance with the girl

The old rancher was in his dotage He hinted of things beyond the range
of possibility That idea of a chance for Dale remained before his
consciousness only an instant Stars were unattainable life could
not be fathomed the secret of nature did not abide alone on the
earththese theories were not any more impossible of proving than that
Helen Rayner might be for him

Nevertheless her strange coming into his life had played havoc the
extent of which he had only begun to realize


For a month he tramped through the forest It was October a still
golden fulfilling season of the year and everywhere in the vast dark
green a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast He
carried his rifle but he never used it He would climb miles and go
this way and that with no object in view Yet his eye and ear had
never been keener Hours he would spend on a promontory watching
the distance where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out
of darkgreen mountain slopes He loved to fling himself down in an
aspengrove at the edge of a senaca and there lie in that radiance like
a veil of gold and purple and red with the white treetrunks striping
the shade Always whether there were breeze or not the aspenleaves
quivered ceaselessly wonderfully like his pulses beyond his control
Often he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to
listen to watch to feel all that was there while his mind held a
haunting darkeyed vision of a girl On the lonely heights like an
eagle he sat gazing down into Paradise Park that was more and more
beautiful but would never again be the same never fill him with
content never be all and all to him

Late in October the first snow fell It melted at once on the south side
of the park but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed
white

Dale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply
of food and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn
during the months he would be snowedin He watched for the darkgray
fastscudding stormclouds and welcomed them when they came Once there
lay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowedin until spring
It would be impossible to go down to Pine And perhaps during the long
winter he would be cured of this strange nameless disorder of his
feelings

November brought storms up on the peaks Flurries of snow fell in
the park every day but the sunny south side where Dales camp lay
retained its autumnal color and warmth Not till late in winter did the
snow creep over this secluded nook

The morning came at last piercingly keen and bright when Dale saw
that the heights were impassable the realization brought him a poignant
regret He had not guessed how he had wanted to see Helen Rayner again
until it was too late That opened his eyes A raging frenzy of action
followed in which he only tired himself physically without helping
himself spiritually

It was sunset when he faced the west looking up at the pink snowdomes
and the darkgolden fringe of spruce and in that moment he found the
truth

I love that girl I love that girl he spoke aloud to the distant
white peaks to the winds to the loneliness and silence of his prison
to the great pines and to the murmuring stream and to his faithful
pets It was his tragic confession of weakness of amazing truth of
hopeless position of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in
him

Dales struggle ended there when he faced his soul To understand
himself was to be released from strain worry ceaseless importuning
doubt and wonder and fear But the fever of unrest of uncertainty had
been nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love

With somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful and others
that he might makehis campfires and meals the care of his pets and
horses the mending of saddles and packharness the curing of buckskin
for moccasins and huntingsuits So his days were not idle But all this
work was habit for him and needed no application of mind

And Dale like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not
retrograde toward the savage was a thinker Love made him a sufferer

The surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender the certain
hopelessness of it the long years of communion with all that was wild
lonely and beautiful the wonderfully developed insight into natures
secrets and the suddendawning revelation that he was no omniscient
being exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of manall these showed
him the strength of his manhood and of his passion and that the life
he had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and
terrible

Helen Rayner haunted him In the sunlight there was not a place
around camp which did not picture her lithe vigorous body her dark
thoughtful eyes her eloquent resolute lips and the smile that was so
sweet and strong At night she was there like a slender specter pacing
beside him under the moaning pines Every campfire held in its heart
the glowing white radiance of her spirit

Nature had taught Dale to love solitude and silence but love itself
taught him their meaning Solitude had been created for the eagle on his
crag for the blasted mountain fir lonely and gnarled on its peak for
the elk and the wolf But it had not been intended for man And to
live always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with
selfto think and dreamto be happy which state however pursued by
man was not good for him Man must be given imperious longings for the
unattainable

It needed then only the memory of an unattainable woman to render
solitude passionately desired by a man yet almost unendurable Dale was
alone with his secret and every pine everything in that park saw him
shaken and undone

In the dark pitchy deadness of night when there was no wind and the
cold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall then the silence seemed
insupportable Many hours that should have been given to slumber were
paced out under the cold white pitiless stars under the lonely pines

Dales memory betrayed him mocked his restraint cheated him of
any peace and his imagination sharpened by love created pictures
fancies feelings that drove him frantic

He thought of Helen Rayners strong shapely brown hand In a thousand
different actions it haunted him How quick and deft in campfire tasks
how graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair how tender and
skilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured how
eloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on
the dangerous heights how expressive of unutterable things when laid on
his arm

Dale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm across his
shoulder and slide round his neck to clasp there He was powerless to
inhibit the picture And what he felt then was boundless unutterable
No woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand and heretofore no
such imaginings had ever crossed his mind yet deep in him somewhere
hidden had been this waiting sweet and imperious need In the bright
day he appeared to ward off such fancies but at night he was helpless
And every fancy left him weaker wilder

When at the culmination of this phase of his passion Dale who
had never known the touch of a womans lips suddenly yielded to the
illusion of Helen Rayners kisses he found himself quite mad filled
with rapture and despair loving her as he hated himself It seemed as
if he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life
and had forgotten them in this life He had no right to think of her
but he could not resist it Imagining the sweet surrender of her lips
was a sacrilege yet here in spite of will and honor and shame he was
lost

Dale at length was vanquished and he ceased to rail at himself or
restrain his fancies He became a dreamy sadeyed campfire gazer
like many another lonely man separated by chance or error from what
the heart hungered most for But this great experience when all its
significance had clarified in his mind immeasurably broadened his
understanding of the principles of nature applied to life

Love had been in him stronger than in most men because of his keen
vigorous lonely years in the forest where health of mind and body were
intensified and preserved How simple how natural how inevitable He
might have loved any finespirited healthybodied girl Like a tree
shooting its branches and leaves its whole entity toward the sunlight
so had he grown toward a womans love Why Because the thing he revered
in nature the spirit the universal the life that was God had created
at his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of
natureto fight for life to feed himself to reproduce his kind That
was all there was to it But oh the mystery the beauty the torment
and the terror of this third instinctthis hunger for the sweetness and
the glory of a womans love



CHAPTER XVI

Helen Rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing
out of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncles ranch

The winter day was bright but steely and the wind that whipped down
from the whitecapped mountains had a keen frosty edge A scant snow
lay in protected places cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges low
sheets of dust scurried across the flats

The big livingroom of the ranchhouse was warm and comfortable with its
red adobe walls its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed and
its manycolored blankets Bo Rayner sat before the fire curled up in
an armchair absorbed in a book On the floor lay the hound Pedro his
racy fine head stretched toward the warmth

Did uncle call asked Helen with a start out of her reverie

I didnt hear him replied Bo

Helen rose to tiptoe across the floor and softly parting some
curtains she looked into the room where her uncle lay He was asleep
Sometimes he called out in his slumbers For weeks now he had been
confined to his bed slowly growing weaker With a sigh Helen returned
to her windowseat and took up her work

Bo the sun is bright she said The days are growing longer Im so
glad

Nell youre always wishing time away For me it passes quickly
enough replied the sister

But I love spring and summer and falland I guess I hate winter
returned Helen thoughtfully

The yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn
swept up to the cold white mountains Helens gaze seemed to go beyond
that snowy barrier And Bos keen eyes studied her sisters earnest sad
face

Nell do you ever think of Dale she queried suddenly

The question startled Helen A slow blush suffused neck and cheek

Of course she replied as if surprised that Bo should ask such a
thing

II shouldnt have asked that said Bo softly and then bent again
over her book

Helen gazed tenderly at that bright bowed head In this swiftflying
eventful busy winter during which the management of the ranch had
devolved wholly upon Helen the little sister had grown away from her
Bo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it to
the amusement of her uncle to the concern of Helen to the dismay and
bewilderment of the faithful Mexican housekeeper and to the undoing of
all the young men on the ranch

Helen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which
she might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and
loving influence But while she hesitated to speak slow footsteps and a
jingle of spurs sounded without and then came a timid knock Bo looked
up brightly and ran to open the door

Oh Its onlyYOU she uttered in withering scorn to the one who
knocked

Helen thought she could guess who that was

How are youall asked a drawling voice

Well Mister Carmichael if that interests youIm quite ill replied
Bo freezingly

Ill Aw no now

Its a fact If I dont die right off Ill have to be taken back to
Missouri said Bo casually

Are you goin to ask me in queried Carmichael bluntly Its
coldan Ive got somethin to say to

To ME Well youre not backward I declare retorted Bo

Miss Rayner I reckon it ll be strange to youfindin out I didnt
come to see you

Indeed No But what was strange was the deluded idea I hadthat you
meant to apologize to melike a gentleman Come in Mr Carmichael
My sister is here

The door closed as Helen turned round Carmichael stood just inside with
his sombrero in hand and as he gazed at Bo his lean face seemed hard
In the few months since autumn he had changedaged it seemed and the
once young frank alert and careless cowboy traits had merged into the
making of a man Helen knew just how much of a man he really was He had
been her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had
fallen upon her shoulders

Wal I reckon you was deluded all rightif you thought Id crawl like
them other lovers of yours he said with cool deliberation

Bo turned pale and her eyes fairly blazed yet even in what must have
been her fury Helen saw amaze and pain

OTHER lovers I think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter
yourself replied Bo stingingly

Me flatter myself Nope You dont savvy me Im shore hatin myself
these days

Small wonder I certainly hate youwith all my heart

At this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see Bo flaunt
herself out of the room But he heard the door close and then slowly
came toward Helen

Cheer up Las Vegas said Helen smiling Bos hottempered

Miss Nell Im just like a dog The meaner she treats me the more I
love her he replied dejectedly

To Helens first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added
admiration respect and a growing appreciation of strong faithful
developing character Carmichaels face and hands were red and chapped
from winter winds the leather of wristbands belt and boots was all
worn shiny and thin little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed
heavily He no longer looked the dashing cowboy ready for a dance or
lark or fight

How in the world did you offend her so asked Helen Bo is furious I
never saw her so angry as that

Miss Nell it was jest this way began Carmichael Shore Bos knowed
I was in love with her I asked her to marry me an she wouldnt say
yes or no An mean as it soundsshe never run away from it thets
shore Weve had some quarrelstwo of them bad an this lasts the
worst

Bo told me about one quarrel said Helen It wasbecause you
drankthat time

Shore it was She took one of her cold spells an I jest got drunk

But that was wrong protested Helen

I aint so shore You see I used to get drunk oftenbefore I come
here An Ive been drunk only once Back at Las Vegas the outfit would
never believe thet Wal I promised Bo I wouldnt do it again an Ive
kept my word

That is fine of you But tell me why is she angry now

Bo makes up to all the fellars confessed Carmichael hanging his
head I took her to the dance last weekover in the townhall Thets
the first time shed gone anywhere with me I shore was proud But
thet dance was hell Bo carried on somethin turrible an I

Tell me What did she do demanded Helen anxiously Im responsible
for her Ive got to see that she behaves

Aw I aint sayin she didnt behave like a lady replied Carmichael
It wasshewal all them fellars are fools over heran Bo wasnt
true to me

My dear boy is Bo engaged to you

Lordif she only was he sighed

Then how can you say she wasnt true to you Be reasonable

I reckon now Miss Nell thet no one can be in love an act
reasonable rejoined the cowboy I dont know how to explain but the
fact is I feel thet Bo has played thethe devil with me an all the
other fellars

You mean she has flirted

I reckon

Las Vegas Im afraid youre right said Helen with growing
apprehension Go on Tell me whats happened

Wal thet Turner boy who rides for Beasley he was hot after Bo
returned Carmichael and he spoke as if memory hurt him Reckon Ive
no use for Turner Hes a finelookin strappin big cowpuncher an
calculated to win the girls He brags thet he can an I reckon hes
right Wal he was always hangin round Bo An he stole one of my
dances with Bo I only had three an he comes up to say this one was
his Bo very innocentoh shes a cute oneshe says Why Mister
Turneris it really yours An she looked so full of joy thet when he
says to me Excoose us friend Carmichael I sat there like a locoed
jackass an let them go But I wasnt mad at thet He was a better
dancer than me an I wanted her to have a good time What started the
hell was I seen him put his arm round her when it wasnt just time
accordin to the dance an Boshe didnt break any records gettin
away from him She pushed him awayafter a littleafter I near died
Wal on the way home I had to tell her I shore did An she said what
Id love to forget Thenthen Miss Nell I grabbed herit was outside
here by the porch an all bright moonlightI grabbed her an hugged an
kissed her good When I let her go I says sorta brave but I was plumb
scaredI says Wal are you goin to marry me now

He concluded with a gulp and looked at Helen with woe in his eyes

Oh What did Bo do breathlessly queried Helen

She slapped me he replied An then she says I did like you best
but NOW I hate you An she slammed the door in my face

I think you made a great mistake said Helen gravely

Wal if I thought so Id beg her forgiveness But I reckon I dont
Whats more I feel better than before Im only a cowboy an never was
much good till I met her Then I braced I got to havin hopes studyin
books an you know how Ive been lookin into this ranchin game I
stopped drinkin an saved my money Wal she knows all thet Once she
said she was proud of me But it didnt seem to count big with her
An if it cant count big I dont want it to count at all I reckon the
madder Bo is at me the more chance Ive got She knows I love herthet
Id die for herthet Im a changed man An she knows I never before
thought of darin to touch her hand An she knows she flirted with
Turner

Shes only a child replied Helen And all this changethe Westthe
wildnessand you boys making much of herwhy its turned her head
But Bo will come out of it true blue She is good loving Her heart is
gold

I reckon I know an my faith cant be shook rejoined Carmichael
simply But she ought to believe thet shell make bad blood out
here The West is the West Any kind of girls are scarce An one like
BoLord we cowboys never seen none to compare with her Shell make
bad blood an some of it will be spilled

Uncle Al encourages her said Helen apprehensively It tickles him
to hear how the boys are after her Oh she doesnt tell him But he
hears And I who must stand in mothers place to her what can I do

Miss Nell are you on my side asked the cowboy wistfully He was
strong and elemental caught in the toils of some power beyond him

Yesterday Helen might have hesitated at that question But today
Carmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty some strange depth of
rugged sincerity as if she had learned his future worth

Yes I am Helen replied earnestly And she offered her hand

Wal then it ll shore turn out happy he said squeezing her hand
His smile was grateful but there was nothing in it of the victory he
hinted at Some of his ruddy color had gone An now I want to tell you
why I come

He had lowered his voice Is Al asleep he whispered

Yes replied Helen He was a little while ago

Reckon Id better shut his door

Helen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the
door then return to her with intent eyes She sensed events in his
look and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her
brother

Shore Im the one thet fetches all the bad news to you he said
regretfully

Helen caught her breath There had indeed been many little calamities
to mar her management of the ranchloss of cattle horses sheepthe
desertion of herders to Beasleyfailure of freighters to arrive
when most neededfights among the cowboysand disagreements over
longarranged deals

Your uncle Al makes a heap of this here Jeff Mulvey asserted
Carmichael

Yes indeed Uncle absolutely relies on Jeff replied Helen

Wal I hate to tell you Miss Nell said the cowboy bitterly thet
Mulvey aint the man he seems

Oh what do you mean

When your uncle dies Mulvey is goin over to Beasley an hes goin to
take all the fellars wholl stick to him

Could Jeff be so faithlessafter so many years my uncles foreman Oh
how do you know

Reckon I guessed long ago But wasnt shore Miss Nell theres a
lot in the wind lately as poor old Al grows weaker Mulvey has been
particular friendly to me an Ive nursed him along cept I wouldnt
drink An his pards have been particular friends with me too more
an more as I loosened up You see they was shy of me when I first got
here Today the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft
ground Bud Lewis whos bunked with me come out an tried to win me
over to Beasleysoon as Auchincloss dies I palavered with Bud an I
wanted to know But Bud would only say he was goin along with Jeff an
others of the outfit I told him Id reckon over it an let him know He
thinks Ill come round

Whywhy will these men leave me whenwhenOh poor uncle They
bargain on his death But whytell me why

Beasley has worked on themwon them over replied Carmichael grimly
After Al dies the ranch will go to you Beasley means to have it He
an Al was pards once an now Beasley has most folks here believin he
got the short end of thet deal Hell have papersshorean hell have
most of the men So hell just put you off an take possession Thets
all Miss Nell an you can rely on its bein true

II believe youbut I cant believe suchsuch robbery possible
gasped Helen

Its simple as two an two Possession is law out here Once Beasley
gets on the ground its settled What could you do with no men to fight
for your property

But surely some of the men will stay with me

I reckon But not enough

Then I can hire more The Beeman boys And Dale would come to help me

Dale would come An hed help a heap I wish he was here replied
Carmichael soberly But theres no way to get him Hes snowedup till
May

I dare not confide in uncle said Helen with agitation The shock
might kill him Then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old
menthat would be cruel Oh it cant be so bad as you think

I reckon it couldnt be no worse AnMiss Nell theres only one way
to get out of itan thets the way of the West

How queried Helen eagerly

Carmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her He seemed
completely detached now from that frank amiable cowboy of her first
impressions The redness was totally gone from his face Something
strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes

I seen Beasley go in the saloon as I rode past Suppose I go down
there pick a quarrel with himan kill him

Helen sat boltupright with a cold shock

Carmichael youre not serious she exclaimed

Serious I shore am Thets the only way Miss Nell An I reckon its
what Al would want An between you an meit would be easier than
ropin a calf These fellars round Pine dont savvy guns Now I come
from where guns mean somethin An when I tell you I can throw a gun
slick an fast why I shore aint braggin You neednt worry none about
me Miss Nell

Helen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility
to mean she feared for his life But what had sickened her was the mere
idea of bloodshed in her behalf

Youdkill Beasleyjust because there are rumors of histreachery
gasped Helen

Shore Itll have to be done anyhow replied the cowboy

No No Its too dreadful to think of Why that would be murder II
cant understand how you speak of itsoso calmly

Reckon I aint doin it calmly Im as mad as hell said Carmichael
with a reckless smile

Oh if you are serious then I say nonono I forbid you I dont
believe Ill be robbed of my property

Wal supposin Beasley does put you offan takes possession What re
you goin to say then demanded the cowboy in slow cool deliberation

Id say the same then as now she replied

He bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero

Shore you girls havent been West very long he muttered as if
apologizing for them An I reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a
country

West or no West I wont have fights deliberately picked and men shot
even if they do threaten me declared Helen positively

All right Miss Nell shore I respect your wishes he returned But
Ill tell you this If Beasley turns you an Bo out of your homewal
Ill look him up on my own account

Helen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door and she thrilled
and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her his love for Bo and
that which was inevitable in himself

Reckon you might save us all some troublenow if youdjust get
madan let me go after thet greaser

Greaser Do you mean Beasley

Shore Hes a halfbreed He was born in Magdalena where I heard folks
say nary one of his parents was no good

That doesnt matter Im thinking of humanity of law and order Of what
is right

Wal Miss Nell Ill wait till you get real mador till Beasley

But my friend Ill not get mad interrupted Helen Ill keep my
temper

Ill bet you dont he retorted Mebbe you think youve none of Bo in
you But Ill bet you could get so madonce you startedthet youd
be turrible What ve you got them eyes for Miss Nell if you aint an
Auchincloss

He was smiling yet he meant every word Helen felt the truth as
something she feared

Las Vegas I wont bet But youyou will always come to mefirstif
theres trouble

I promise he replied soberly and then went out

Helen found that she was trembling and that there was a commotion in
her breast Carmichael had frightened her No longer did she hold doubt
of the gravity of the situation She had seen Beasley often several
times close at hand and once she had been forced to meet him That time
had convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her And on
this account coupled with the fact that Riggs appeared to have nothing
else to do but shadow her she had been slow in developing her intention
of organizing and teaching a school for the children of Pine Riggs had
become rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements Yet his bold
apparent badness had made its impression From all reports he spent his
time gambling drinking and bragging It was no longer news in Pine
what his intentions were toward Helen Rayner Twice he had ridden up to
the ranchhouse upon one occasion securing an interview with Helen In
spite of her contempt and indifference he was actually influencing her
life there in Pine And it began to appear that the other man Beasley
might soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions

The responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden It
could not be managed at least by her in the way Auchincloss wanted
it done He was old irritable irrational and hard Almost all the
neighbors were set against him and naturally did not take kindly to
Helen

She had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part
of her uncle but he had been a hard driver Then his shrewd farseeing
judgment had made all his deals fortunate for him which fact had not
brought a profit of friendship

Of late since Auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating Helen
had taken many decisions upon herself with gratifying and hopeful
results But the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in
the West still held aloof The memory of Paradise Park seemed only a
dream sweeter and more intangible as time passed and fuller of vague
regrets Bo was a comfort but also a very considerable source of
anxiety She might have been a help to Helen if she had not assimilated
Western ways so swiftly Helen wished to decide things in her own way
which was as yet quite far from Western So Helen had been thrown more
and more upon her own resources with the cowboy Carmichael the only one
who had come forward voluntarily to her aid

For an hour Helen sat alone in the room looking out of the window and
facing stern reality with a colder graver keener sense of intimacy
than ever before To hold her property and to live her life in this
community according to her ideas of honesty justice and law might well
be beyond her powers Today she had been convinced that she could not
do so without fighting for them and to fight she must have friends
That conviction warmed her toward Carmichael and a thoughtful
consideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully
appreciated him She would make up for her oversight

There were no Mormons in her employ for the good reason that
Auchincloss would not hire them But in one of his kindlier hours
growing rare now he had admitted that the Mormons were the best and the
most sober faithful workers on the ranges and that his sole objection
to them was just this fact of their superiority Helen decided to hire
the four Beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come
and to do this if possible without letting her uncle know His temper
now as well as his judgment was a hindrance to efficiency This
decision regarding the Beemans brought Helen back to Carmichaels
fervent wish for Dale and then to her own

Soon spring would be at hand with its multiplicity of range tasks Dale
had promised to come to Pine then and Helen knew that promise would be
kept Her heart beat a little faster in spite of her businesscentered
thoughts Dale was there over the blacksloped snowytipped mountain
shut away from the world Helen almost envied him No wonder he loved
loneliness solitude the sweet wild silence and beauty of Paradise
Park But he was selfish and Helen meant to show him that She needed
his help When she recalled his physical prowess with animals and
imagined what it must be in relation to men she actually smiled at the
thought of Beasley forcing her off her property if Dale were there
Beasley would only force disaster upon himself Then Helen experienced
a quick shock Would Dale answer to this situation as Carmichael had
answered It afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary
The cowboy was one of a bloodletting breed the hunter was a man of
thought gentleness humanity This situation was one of the kind that
had made him despise the littleness of men Helen assured herself
that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy in all the
relations of life which she had observed while with him But a doubt
lingered in her mind She remembered his calm reference to Snake Anson
and that caused a recurrence of the little shiver Carmichael had given
her When the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be
able to control Dale then she tried not to think of it any more It
confused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought
that though it would be dreadful for Carmichael to kill Beasley for
Dale to do it would be a calamitya terrible thing Helen did not
analyze that strange thought She was as afraid of it as she was of the
stir in her blood when she visualized Dale

Her meditation was interrupted by Bo who entered the room
rebelliouseyed and very lofty Her manner changed which apparently
owed its cause to the fact that Helen was alone

Is thatcowboy gone she asked

Yes He left quite some time ago replied Helen

I wondered if he made your eyes shineyour color burn so Nell youre
just beautiful

Is my face burning asked Helen with a little laugh So it is
Well Bo youve no cause for jealousy Las Vegas cant be blamed for my
blushes

Jealous Me Of that wildeyed softvoiced twofaced cowpuncher I
guess not Nell Rayner What d he say about me

Bo he said a lot replied Helen reflectively Ill tell you
presently First I want to ask youhas Carmichael ever told you how
hes helped me

No When I see himwhich hasnt been often latelyheIWell we
fight Nell has he helped you

Helen smiled in faint amusement She was going to be sincere but she
meant to keep her word to the cowboy The fact was that reflection had
acquainted her with her indebtedness to Carmichael

Bo youve been so wild to ride halfbroken mustangsand carry on with
cowboysand readand sewand keep your secrets that youve had no
time for your sister or her troubles

Nell burst out Bo in amaze and pain She flew to Helen and seized
her hands What re you saying

Its all true replied Helen thrilling and softening This sweet
sister once aroused would be hard to resist Helen imagined she should
hold to her tone of reproach and severity

Sure its true cried Bo fiercely But whats my fooling got to do
with thethe rest you said Nell are you keeping things from me

My dear I never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles

But IveIve nursed unclesat up with himjust the same as you
said Bo with quivering lips

Yes youve been good to him

Weve no other troubles have we Nell

You havent but I have responded Helen reproachfully

Whywhy didnt you tell me cried Bo passionately What are they
Tell me now You must think me aa selfish hateful cat

Bo Ive had much to worry meand the worst is yet to come replied
Helen Then she told Bo how complicated and bewildering was the
management of a big ranchwhen the owner was ill testy defective in
memory and hard as steelwhen he had hoards of gold and notes but
could not or would not remember his obligationswhen the neighbor
ranchers had just claimswhen cowboys and sheepherders were
discontented and wrangled among themselveswhen great herds of cattle
and flocks of sheep had to be fed in winterwhen supplies had to be
continually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly when an enemy
rancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of
deliberately taking over the property when the owner died Then Helen
told how she had only that day realized the extent of Carmichaels
advice and help and laborhow indeed he had been a brother to
herhow

But at this juncture Bo buried her face in Helens breast and began to
cry wildly

IIdont wantto hearany more she sobbed

Well youve got to hear it replied Helen inexorably I want you to
know how hes stood by me

But I hate him

Bo I suspect thats not true

I doI do

Well you act and talk very strangely then

Nell Raynerareyouyou sticking up for thatthat devil

I am yes so far as it concerns my conscience rejoined Helen
earnestly I never appreciated him as he deservednot until now Hes
a man Bo every inch of him Ive seen him grow up to that in three
months Id never have gotten along without him I think hes fine
manly big I

Ill bethes made loveto you too replied Bo woefully

Talk sense said Helen sharply He has been a brother to me But
Bo Rayner if he HAD made love to me II might have appreciated it more
than you

Bo raised her face flushed in part and also pale with tearwet cheeks
and the telltale blaze in the blue eyes

Ive been wild about that fellow But I hate him too she said with
flashing spirit And I want to go on hating him So dont tell me any
more

Whereupon Helen briefly and graphically related how Carmichael had
offered to kill Beasley as the only way to save her property and how
when she refused that he threatened he would do it anyhow

Bo fell over with a gasp and clung to Helen

OhNell Oh now I love him more thanever she cried in mingled
rage and despair

Helen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days
not so very far back when troubles were not so serious as now

Of course you love him she concluded I guessed that long ago And
Im glad But youve been wilfulfoolish You wouldnt surrender to it
You wanted your fling with the other boys YoureOh Bo I fear you
have been a sad little flirt

II wasnt very bad tilltill he got bossy Why Nell he
actedright offjust as if he OWNED me But he didnt And to show
himII really did flirt with that Turner fellow Then hehe insulted
me Oh I hate him

Nonsense Bo You cant hate any one while you love him protested
Helen

Much you know about that flashed Bo You just can Look here Did
you ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse

Yes I have

Do you have any idea how strong a cowboy ishow his hands and arms are
like iron

Yes Im sure I know that too

And how savage he is

Yes

And how he goes at anything he wants to do

I must admit cowboys are abrupt responded Helen with a smile

Well Miss Rayner did you everwhen you were standing quiet like a
ladydid you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lungegrab
you and hold you so you couldnt move or breathe or screamhug you
till all your bones crackedand kiss you so fierce and so hard that you
wanted to kill him and die

Helen had gradually drawn back from this blazingeyed eloquent sister
and when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to
reply

There I see you never had that done to you resumed Bo with
satisfaction So dont ever talk to me

Ive heard his side of the story said Helen constrainedly

With a start Bo sat up straighter as if better to defend herself

Oh So you have And I suppose youll take his parteven about
thatthat bearish trick

No I think that rude and bold But Bo I dont believe he meant to
be either rude or bold From what he confessed to me I gather that he
believed hed lose you outright or win you outright by that violence It
seems girls cant play at love out here in this wild West He said there
would be blood shed over you I begin to realize what he meant Hes
not sorry for what he did Think how strange that is For he has the
instincts of a gentleman Hes kind gentle chivalrous Evidently he
had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance He
did that as a last resort In my opinion his motives were to force you
to accept or refuse him and in case you refused him hed always have
those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his selfrespectwhen he
thought of Turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you Bo
I see through Carmichael even if I dont make him clear to you Youve
got to be honest with yourself Did that act of his win or lose you In
other words do you love him or not

Bo hid her face

Oh Nell it made me see how I loved himand that made me soso sick
I hated him But nowthe hate is all gone



CHAPTER XVII

When spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over
the brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion
old Al Auchincloss had been a month in his grave

To Helen it seemed longer The month had been crowded with work events
and growing more hopeful duties so that it contained a world
of living The uncle had not been forgotten but the innumerable
restrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest
Beasley had not presented himself or any claim upon Helen and she
gathering confidence day by day began to believe all that purport of
trouble had been exaggerated

In this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it
The estate was large She had no accurate knowledge of how many acres
she owned but it was more than two thousand The fine old rambling
ranchhouse set like a fort on the last of the foothills corrals and
fields and barns and meadows and the rolling green range beyond and
innumerable sheep horses cattleall these belonged to Helen to her
everwondering realization and evergrowing joy Still she was afraid
to let herself go and be perfectly happy Always there was the fear that
had been too deep and strong to forget so soon

This bright fresh morning in March Helen came out upon the porch to
revel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp pinescented
wind that swept down from the mountains There was never a morning that
she did not gaze mountainward trying to see with a folly she realized
if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge
For all she could see it had not melted an inch and she would
not confess why she sighed The desert had become green and fresh
stretching away there far below her range growing dark and purple in
the distance with vague buttes rising The air was full of soundnotes
of blackbirds and the baas of sheep and blasts from the corrals and
the clatter of light hoofs on the court below

Bo was riding in from the stables Helen loved to watch her on one of
those fiery little mustangs but the sight was likewise given to rousing
apprehensions This morning Bo appeared particularly bent on frightening
Helen Down the lane Carmichael appeared waving his arms and Helen
at once connected him with Bos manifest desire to fly away from that
particular place Since that day a month back when Bo had confessed
her love for Carmichael she and Helen had not spoken of it or of the
cowboy The boy and girl were still at odds But this did not worry
Helen Bo had changed much for the better especially in that she
devoted herself to Helen and to her work Helen knew that all would
turn out well in the end and so she had been careful of her rather
precarious position between these two young firebrands

Bo reined in the mustang at the porch steps She wore a buckskin
ridingsuit which she had made herself and its soft gray with the
touches of red beads was mightily becoming to her Then she had grown
considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to
resemble a boy yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe Red spots
shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that everdangerous blaze

Nell did you give me away to that cowboy she demanded

Give you away exclaimed Helen blankly

Yes You know I told youawhile backthat I was wildly in love with
him Did you give me awaytell on me

She might have been furious but she certainly was not confused

Why Bo How could you No I did not replied Helen

Never gave him a hint

Not even a hint You have my word for that Why Whats happened

He makes me sick

Bo would not say any more owing to the near approach of the cowboy

Mawnin Miss Nell he drawled I was just tellin this here Miss
BoPeep Rayner

Dont call me that broke in Bo with fire in her voice

Wal I was just tellin her thet she wasnt goin off on any more of
them long rides Honest now Miss Nell it aint safe an

Youre not my boss retorted Bo

Indeed sister I agree with him You wont obey me

Reckon some ones got to be your boss drawled Carmichael Shore I
aint hankerin for the job You could ride to Kingdom Come or off among
the Apachesor over here a waysat this he grinned knowinglyor
anywheres for all I cared But Im workin for Miss Nell an shes
boss An if she says youre not to take them ridesyou wont Savvy
that miss

It was a treat for Helen to see Bo look at the cowboy

Mister Carmichael may I ask how you are going to prevent me from
riding where I like

Wal if youre goin worse locoed this way Ill keep you offn a hoss
if I have to rope you an tie you up By golly I will

His dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said

Wal she drawled it very softly and sweetly but venomously
ifyouevertouchme again

At this he flushed then made a quick passionate gesture with his hand
expressive of heat and shame

You an me will never get along he said with a dignity full of
pathos I seen thet a month back when you changed suddenlike to me
But nothin I say to you has any reckonin of mine Im talkin for your
sister Its for her sake An your own I never told her an I never
told you thet Ive seen Riggs sneakin after you twice on them desert
rides Wal I tell you now

The intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on Bo But
Helen was astonished and alarmed

Riggs Oh Bo Ive seen him myselfriding around He does not mean
well You must be careful

If I ketch him again went on Carmichael with his mouth lining hard
Im goin after him

He gave her a cool intent piercing look then he dropped his head and
turned away to stride back toward the corrals

Helen could make little of the manner in which her sister watched the
cowboy pass out of sight

A month backwhen I changed suddenlike mused Bo I wonder what he
meant by that Nell did I changeright after the talk you had with
meabout him

Indeed you did Bo replied Helen But it was for the better Only
he cant see it How proud and sensitive he is You wouldnt guess it
at first Bo your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting He
thinks its indifference

Maybe that ll be good for him declared Bo Does he expect me to
fall on his neck Hes that thickheaded Why hes the locoed one not
me

Id like to ask you Bo if youve seen how he has changed queried
Helen earnestly Hes older Hes worried Either his heart is
breaking for you or else he fears trouble for us I fear its both How
he watches you Bo he knows all you dowhere you go That about Riggs
sickens me

If Riggs follows me and tries any of his fourflush desperado games
hell have his hands full said Bo grimly And that without my cowboy
protector But I just wish Riggs would do something Then well see what
Las Vegas Tom Carmichael cares Then well see

Bo bit out the last words passionately and jealously then she lifted
her bridle to the spirited mustang

Nell dont you fear for me she said I can take care of myself

Helen watched her ride away all but willing to confess that there
might be truth in what Bo said Then Helen went about her work which
consisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize
herself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life Every
day brought new problems She made notes of all that she observed and
all that was told her which habit she had found after a few weeks of
trial was going to be exceedingly valuable to her She did not intend
always to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men however faithful
some of them might be

This morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind
owing to the presence of Roy Beeman and two of his brothers who had
arrived yesterday And she was to discover that Jeff Mulvey accompanied
by six of his coworkers and associates had deserted her without a word
or even sending for their pay Carmichael had predicted this Helen had
half doubted It was a relief now to be confronted with facts however
disturbing She had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more
trouble than had happened At the gateway of the main corral a huge
inclosure fenced high with peeled logs she met Roy Beeman lasso in
hand the same tall lean limping figure she remembered so well
Sight of him gave her an inexplicable thrilla flashing memory of an
unforgettable night ride Roy was to have charge of the horses on the
ranch of which there were several hundred not counting many lost on
range and mountain or the unbranded colts

Roy took off his sombrero and greeted her This Mormon had a courtesy
for women that spoke well for him Helen wished she had more employees
like him

Its jest as Las Vegas told us it d be he said regretfully Mulvey
an his pards lit out this mornin Im sorry Miss Helen Reckon thets
all because I come over

I heard the news replied Helen You neednt be sorry Roy for Im
not Im glad I want to know whom I can trust

Las Vegas says were shore in for it now

Roy what do you think

I reckon so Still Las Vegas is powerful cross these days an always
lookin on the dark side With us boys now its sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof But Miss Helen if Beasley forces the deal
there will be serious trouble Ive seen thet happen Four or five years
ago Beasley rode some greasers off their farms an no one ever knowed if
he had a just claim

Beasley has no claim on my property My uncle solemnly swore that on
his deathbed And I find nothing in his books or papers of those years
when he employed Beasley In fact Beasley was never uncles partner
The truth is that my uncle took Beasley up when he was a poor homeless
boy

So my old dad says replied Roy But whats right dont always
prevail in these parts

Roy youre the keenest man Ive met since I came West Tell me what
you think will happen

Beeman appeared flattered but he hesitated to reply Helen had long
been aware of the reticence of these outdoor men

I reckon you mean cause an effect as Milt Dale would say responded
Roy thoughtfully

Yes If Beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen

Roy looked up and met her gaze Helen remembered that singular
stillness intentness of his face

Wal if Dale an John get here in time I reckon we can bluff thet
Beasley outfit

You mean my friendsmy men would confront Beasleyrefuse his
demandsand if necessary fight him off

I shore do replied Roy

But suppose youre not all here Beasley would be smart enough to
choose an opportune time Suppose he did put me off and take possession
What then

Then it d only be a matter of how soon Dale or Carmichaelor Igot
to Beasley

Roy I feared just that It haunts me Carmichael asked me to let him
go pick a fight with Beasley Asked me just as he would ask me about
his work I was shocked And now you say Daleand you

Helen choked in her agitation

Miss Helen what else could you look for Las Vegas is in love with
Miss Bo Shore he told me so An Dales in love with you Why you
couldnt stop them any more n you could stop the wind from blowin down
a pine when it got ready Now its some different with me Im a
Mormon an Im married But Im Dales pard these many years An
I care a powerful sight for you an Miss Bo So I reckon Id draw on
Beasley the first chance I got

Helen strove for utterance but it was denied her Roys simple
statement of Dales love had magnified her emotion by completely
changing its direction She forgot what she had felt wretched about She
could not look at Roy

Miss Helen dont feel bad he said kindly Shore youre not to
blame Your comin West hasnt made any difference in Beasleys fate
except mebbe to hurry it a little My dad is old an when he talks
its like history He looks back on happenins Wal its the nature of
happenins that Beasley passes away before his prime Them of his breed
dont live old in the West So I reckon you neednt feel bad or
worry Youve got friends

Helen incoherently thanked him and forgetting her usual round of
corrals and stables she hurried back toward the house deeply stirred
throbbing and dimeyed with a feeling she could not control Roy Beeman
had made a statement that had upset her equilibrium It seemed simple
and natural yet momentous and staggering To hear that Dale loved
herto hear it spoken frankly earnestly by Dales best friend was
strange sweet terrifying But was it true Her own consciousness had
admitted it Yet that was vastly different from a mans open statement
No longer was it a dear dream a secret that seemed hers alone How she
had lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast

Something burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the
mountains and her sight became clear telescopic with its intensity
Magnificently the mountains loomed Black inroads and patches on the
slopes showed where a few days back all bad been white The snow was
melting fast Dale would soon be free to ride down to Pine And that was
an event Helen prayed for yet feared as she had never feared anything


The noonday dinnerbell startled Helen from a reverie that was a
pleasant aftermath of her unrestraint How the hours had flown This
morning at least must be credited to indolence

Bo was not in the diningroom nor in her own room nor was she in
sight from window or door This absence had occurred before but not
particularly to disturb Helen In this instance however she grew
worried Her nerves presaged strain There was an overcharge of
sensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very
atmosphere She ate dinner alone looking her apprehension which was
not mitigated by the expressive fears of old Maria the Mexican woman
who served her

After dinner she sent word to Roy and Carmichael that they had better
ride out to look for Bo Then Helen applied herself resolutely to her
books until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump
up and hurry to the porch Roy was riding in

Did you find her queried Helen hurriedly

Wasnt no track or sign of her up the north range replied Roy as he
dismounted and threw his bridle An I was ridin back to take up her
tracks from the corral an trail her But I seen Las Vegas comin an he
waved his sombrero He was comin up from the south There he is now

Carmichael appeared swinging into the lane He was mounted on Helens
big black Ranger and he made the dust fly

Wal hes seen her thets shore vouchsafed Roy with relief as
Carmichael rode up

Miss Nell shes comin said the cowboy as he reined in and
slid down with his graceful single motion Then in a violent action
characteristic of him he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and
threw up both arms Ive a hunch its come off

Oh what exclaimed Helen

Now Las Vegas talk sense expostulated Roy Miss Helen is shore
nervous today Has anythin happened

I reckon but I dont know what replied Carmichael drawing a long
breath Folks I must be gettin old For I shore felt orful queer till
I seen Bo She was ridin down the ridge across the valley Ridin some
fast too an shell be here right off if she doesnt stop in the
village

Wal I hear her comin now said Roy Anif you asked me Id say
she WAS ridin some fast

Helen heard the light swift rhythmic beat of hoofs and then out on
the curve of the road that led down to Pine she saw Bos mustang white
with lather coming on a dead run

Las Vegas do you see any Apaches asked Roy quizzingly

The cowboy made no reply but he strode out from the porch directly
in front of the mustang Bo was pulling hard on the bridle and had him
slowing down but not controlled When he reached the house it could
easily be seen that Bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength
which was not enough to halt him Carmichael lunged for the bridle and
seizing it hauled him to a standstill

At close sight of Bo Helen uttered a startled cry Bo was white her
sombrero was gone and her hair undone there were blood and dirt on
her face and her ridingsuit was torn and muddy She had evidently
sustained a fall Roy gazed at her in admiring consternation but
Carmichael never looked at her at all Apparently he was examining the
horse Well help me offsomebody cried Bo peremptorily Her voice
was weak but not her spirit

Roy sprang to help her off and when she was down it developed that she
was lame

Oh Bo Youve had a tumble exclaimed Helen anxiously and she ran
to assist Roy They led her up the porch and to the door There she
turned to look at Carmichael who was still examining the spent mustang

Tell himto come in she whispered

Hey there Las Vegas called Roy Rustle hyar will you

When Bo had been led into the sittingroom and seated in a chair
Carmichael entered His face was a study as slowly he walked up to Bo

Girl youaint hurt he asked huskily

Its no fault of yours that Im not crippledor dead or worse
retorted Bo You said the south range was the only safe ride for me
And thereIit happened

She panted a little and her bosom heaved One of her gauntlets was gone
and the bare band that was bruised and bloody trembled as she held it
out

Dear tell usare you badly hurt queried Helen with hurried
gentleness

Not much Ive had a spill replied Bo But oh Im madIm
boiling

She looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries but
certainly she had not overestimated her state of mind Any blaze Helen
had heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one
It actually leaped Bo was more than pretty then Manifestly Roy was
admiring her looks but Carmichael saw beyond her charm And slowly he
was growing pale

I rode out the south rangeas I was told began Bo breathing hard
and trying to control her feelings Thats the ride you usually take
Nell and you betif youd taken it todayyoud not be here now
About three miles out I climbed off the range up that cedar slope I
always keep to high ground When I got up I saw two horsemen ride out
of some broken rocks off to the east They rode as if to come between me
and home I didnt like that I circled south About a mile farther on I
spied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came
along slow That I liked still less It might have been accident but it
looked to me as if those riders had some intent All I could do was head
off to the southeast and ride You bet I did ride But I got into rough
ground where Id never been before It was slow going At last I made
the cedars and here I cut loose believing I could circle ahead of those
strange riders and come round through Pine I had it wrong

Here she hesitated perhaps for breath for she had spoken rapidly or
perhaps to get better hold on her subject Not improbably the effect she
was creating on her listeners began to be significant Roy sat absorbed
perfectly motionless eyes keen as steel his mouth open Carmichael
was gazing over Bos head out of the window and it seemed that he
must know the rest of her narrative Helen knew that her own wideeyed
attention alone would have been allcompelling inspiration to Bo Rayner

Sure I had it wrong resumed Bo Pretty soon heard a horse behind I
looked back I saw a big bay riding down on me Oh but he was running
He just tore through the cedars  I was scared half out of my senses
But I spurred and beat my mustang Then began a race Rough goingthick
cedarswashes and gullies I had to make him runto keep my saddleto
pick my way Ohhh but it was glorious To race for funthats
one thing to race for your life is another My heart was in my
mouthchoking me I couldnt have yelled I was as cold as icedizzy
sometimesblind othersthen my stomach turnedand I couldnt get my
breath Yet the wild thrills I had But I stuck on and held my own
for several milesto the edge of the cedars There the big horse gained
on me He came pounding closerperhaps as close as a hundred yardsI
could hear him plain enough Then I had my spill Oh my mustang
trippedthrew me way over his head I hit light but slid farand
thats what scraped me so I know my knee is raw When I got to my
feet the big horse dashed up throwing gravel all over meand his rider
jumped off Now who do you think he was

Helen knew but she did not voice her conviction Carmichael knew
positively yet he kept silent Roy was smiling as if the narrative
told did not seem so alarming to him

Wal the fact of you bein here safe an sound sorta makes no
difference who thet sonofagun was he said

Riggs Harve Riggs blazed Bo The instant I recognized him I got
over my scare And so mad I burned all through like fire I dont know
what I said but it was wildand it was a whole lot you bet

You sure can ride he said

I demanded why he had dared to chase me and he said he had an
important message for Nell This was it Tell your sister that Beasley
means to put her off an take the ranch If shell marry me Ill block
his deal If she wont marry me Ill go in with Beasley Then he told
me to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except Nell Well
here I amand I seem to have been breathing rather fast

She looked from Helen to Roy and from Roy to Las Vegas Her smile was
for the latter and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile
would have told volumes

Wal Ill be doggoned ejaculated Roy feelingly

Helen laughed

Indeed the working of that mans mind is beyond me Marry him to
save my ranch I wouldnt marry him to save my life

Carmichael suddenly broke his silence

Bo did you see the other men

Yes I was coming to that she replied I caught a glimpse of
them back in the cedars The three were together or at least three
horsemen were there They had halted behind some trees Then on the way
home I began to think Even in my fury I had received impressions Riggs
was SURPRISED when I got up Ill bet he had not expected me to be who I
was He thought I was NELL I look bigger in this buckskin outfit My
hair was up till I lost my hat and that was when I had the tumble He
took me for Nell Another thing I rememberhe made some signsome
motion while I was calling him names and I believe that was to keep
those other men back I believe Riggs had a plan with those other men
to waylay Nell and make off with her I absolutely know it

Bo youre sosoyou jump at wild ideas so protested Helen trying
to believe in her own assurance But inwardly she was trembling

Miss Helen that aint a wild idee said Roy seriously I reckon
your sister is pretty close on the trail Las Vegas dont you savvy it
thet way

Carmichaels answer was to stalk out of the room

Call him back cried Helen apprehensively

Hold on boy called Roy sharply

Helen reached the door simultaneously with Roy The cowboy picked up his
sombrero jammed it on his head gave his belt a vicious hitch that made
the gunsheath jump and then in one giant step he was astride Ranger

Carmichael Stay cried Helen

The cowboy spurred the black and the stones rang under ironshod hoofs

Bo Call him back Please call him back importuned Helen in
distress

I wont declared Bo Rayner Her face shone whiter now and her eyes
were like fiery flint That was her answer to a loving gentlehearted
sister that was her answer to the call of the West

No use said Roy quietly An I reckon Id better trail him up

He too strode out and mounting his horse galloped swiftly away


It turned out that Bo was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she
had imagined One knee was rather badly cut which injury alone would
have kept her from riding again very soon Helen who was somewhat
skilled at bandaging wounds worried a great deal over these sundry
blotches on Bos fair skin and it took considerable time to wash and
dress them Long after this was done and during the early supper and
afterward Bos excitement remained unabated The whiteness stayed on
her face and the blaze in her eyes Helen ordered and begged her to go
to bed for the fact was Bo could not stand up and her hands shook

Go to bed Not much she said I want to know what he does to Riggs

It was that possibility which had Helen in dreadful suspense If
Carmichael killed Riggs it seemed to Helen that the bottom would
drop out of this structure of Western life she had begun to build so
earnestly and fearfully She did not believe that he would do so But
the uncertainty was torturing

Dear Bo appealed Helen you dont wantOh you do want Carmichael
toto kill Riggs

No I dont but I wouldnt care if he did replied Bo bluntly

Do you thinkhe will

Nell if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before
he left declared Bo And he knew what I thought hed do

And whatsthat faltered Helen

I want him to round Riggs up down in the villagesomewhere in a crowd
I want Riggs shown up as the coward braggart fourflush that he is
And insulted slapped kickeddriven out of Pine

Her passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came
footsteps on the porch Helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and
open it just as a tap sounded on the doorpost Roys face stood white
out of the darkness His eyes were bright And his smile made Helens
fearful query needless

How are youall this evenin he drawled as he came in

A fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table By their
light Bo looked white and eagereyed as she reclined in the big
armchair

What d he do she asked with all her amazing force

Wal now aint you goin to tell me how you are

Roy Im all bunged up I ought to be in bed but I just couldnt sleep
till I hear what Las Vegas did Id forgive anything except him getting
drunk

Wal I shore can ease your mind on thet replied Roy He never drank
a drop

Roy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have
guessed he was eager to tell For once the hard intent quietness the
soul of labor pain and endurance so plain in his face was softened by
pleasurable emotion He poked at the burning logs with the toe of his
boot Helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no
spurs Then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down
in Pine

Where IS he asked Bo

Who Riggs Wal I dont know But I reckon hes somewhere out in the
woods nursin himself

Not Riggs First tell me where HE is

Shore then you must mean Las Vegas I just left him down at the
cabin He was gettin ready for bed early as it is All tired out he
was an thet white you wouldnt have knowed him But he looked happy at
thet an the last words he said more to himself than to me I reckon
was Im some locoed gent but if she doesnt call me Tom now shes no
good

Bo actually clapped her hands notwithstanding that one of them was
bandaged

Call him Tom I should smile I will she declared in delight Hurry
nowwhat d

Its shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle Las Vegas went
on Roy imperturbably

Roy tell me what he didwhat TOM didor Ill scream cried Bo

Miss Helen did you ever see the likes of thet girl asked Roy
appealing to Helen

No Roy I never did agreed Helen But pleaseplease tell us what
has happened

Roy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight almost
fiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep
within him Whatever had happened to Riggs had not been too much for
Roy Beeman Helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real Westerner
hated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado the makebelieve
gunman who pretended to sail under the true wild and reckoning colors
of the West

Roy leaned his lithe tall form against the stone mantelpiece and faced
the girls

When I rode out after Las Vegas I seen him way down the road began
Roy rapidly An I seen another man ridin down into Pine from the
other side Thet was Riggs only I didnt know it then Las Vegas rode
up to the store where some fellars was hangin round an he spoke to
them When I come up they was all headin for Turners saloon I seen a
dozen hosses hitched to the rails Las Vegas rode on But I got off at
Turners an went in with the bunch Whatever it was Las Vegas said
to them fellars shore they didnt give him away Pretty soon more men
strolled into Turners an there got to be most twenty altogether I
reckon Jeff Mulvey was there with his pards They had been drinkin
sorta free An I didnt like the way Mulvey watched me So I went
out an into the store but kept alookin for Las Vegas He wasnt in
sight But I seen Riggs ridin up Now Turners is where Riggs hangs
out an does his braggin He looked powerful deep an thoughtful
dismounted slow without seein the unusual number of hosses there an
then he slouches into Turners No more n a minute after Las Vegas rode
down there like a streak An just as quick he was off an through thet
door

Roy paused as if to gain force or to choose his words His tale now
appeared all directed to Bo who gazed at him spellbound a fascinated
listener

Before I got to Turners dooran thet was only a little waysI heard
Las Vegas yell Did you ever hear him Wal hes got the wildest yell
of any cowpuncher I ever beard Quicklike I opened the door an slipped
in There was Riggs an Las Vegas alone in the center of the big saloon
with the crowd edgin to the walls an slidin back of the bar Riggs
was whiter n a dead man I didnt hear an I dont know what Las Vegas
yelled at him But Riggs knew an so did the gang All of a sudden every
man there shore seen in Las Vegas what Riggs had always bragged HE was
Thet time comes to every man like Riggs

What d you call me he asked his jaw shakin

I aint called you yet answered Las Vegas I just whooped

What dye want

You scared my girl

The hell ye say Whos she blustered Riggs an he began to take
quick looks round But he never moved a hand There was somethin tight
about the way he stood Las Vegas had both arms half out stretched as
if he meant to leap But he wasnt I never seen Las Vegas do thet but
when I seen him then I understood it

You know An you threatened her an her sister Go for your gun
called Las Vegas low an sharp

Thet put the crowd right an nobody moved Riggs turned green then I
almost felt sorry for him He began to shake so hed dropped a gun if he
had pulled one

Hyar youre offsome mistakeI aint seen no gurlsI

Shut up an draw yelled Las Vegas His voice just pierced holes in
the roof an it might have been a bullet from the way Riggs collapsed
Every man seen in a second more thet Riggs wouldnt an couldnt draw
He was afraid for his life He was not what he had claimed to be I
dont know if he had any friends there But in the West good men an bad
men all alike have no use for Riggss kind An thet stony quiet broke
with hawhaw It shore was as pitiful to see Riggs as it was fine to
see Las Vegas

When he dropped his arms then I knowed there would be no gunplay An
then Las Vegas got red in the face He slapped Riggs with one hand
then with the other An he began to cuss him I shore never knowed
thet nicespoken Las Vegas Carmichael could use such language It was a
stream of the baddest names known out here an lots I never heard of
Now an then I caught somethin like lowdown an sneak an fourflush
an longhaired skunk but for the most part they was just the cussedest
kind of names An Las Vegas spouted them till he was black in the face
an foamin at the mouth an hoarser n a bawlin cow

When he got out of breath from cussin he punched Riggs all about the
saloon threw him outdoors knocked him down an kicked him till he got
kickin him down the road with the whole hawhawed gang behind An he
drove him out of town



CHAPTER XVIII

For two days Bo was confined to her bed suffering considerable pain
and subject to fever during which she talked irrationally Some of this
talk afforded Helen as vast an amusement as she was certain it would
have lifted Tom Carmichael to a seventh heaven

The third day however Bo was better and refusing to remain in bed
she hobbled to the sittingroom where she divided her time between
staring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering Helen with
questions she tried to make appear casual But Helen saw through her
case and was in a state of glee What she hoped most for was that
Carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo It
was that kind of treatment the young lady needed And now was the great
opportunity Helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint

Neither this day nor the next however did he put in an appearance
at the house though Helen saw him twice on her rounds He was busy as
usual and greeted her as if nothing particular had happened

Roy called twice once in the afternoon and again during the evening
He grew more likable upon longer acquaintance This last visit he
rendered Bo speechless by teasing her about another girl Carmichael was
going to take to a dance Bos face showed that her vanity could not
believe this statement but that her intelligence of young men credited
it with being possible Roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind
He made a dry casual little remark about the snow never melting on the
mountains during the latter part of March and the look with which he
accompanied this remark brought a blush to Helens cheek

After Roy had departed Bo said to Helen Confound that fellow He sees
right through me

My dear youre rather transparent these days murmured Helen

You neednt talk He gave you a dig retorted Bo He just knows
youre dying to see the snow melt

Gracious I hope Im not so bad as that Of course I want the snow
melted and spring to come and flowers

Hal Ha Ha taunted Bo Nell Rayner do you see any green in my eyes
Spring to come Yes the poet said in the spring a young mans fancy
lightly turns to thoughts of love But that poet meant a young woman

Helen gazed out of the window at the white stars

Nell have you seen himsince I was hurt continued Bo with an
effort

Him Who

Oh whom do you suppose I mean Tom she responded and the last word
came with a burst

Tom Whos he Ah you mean Las Vegas Yes Ive seen him

Well did he ask aabout me

I believe he did ask how you weresomething like that

Humph Nell I dont always trust you After that she relapsed into
silence read awhile and dreamed awhile looking into the fire and
then she limped over to kiss Helen good night and left the room

Next day she was rather quiet seeming upon the verge of one of the
dispirited spells she got infrequently Early in the evening just after
the lights had been lit and she had joined Helen in the sittingroom a
familiar step sounded on the loose boards of the porch

Helen went to the door to admit Carmichael He was cleanshaven
dressed in his dark suit which presented such marked contrast from
his ridinggarb and he wore a flower in his buttonhole Nevertheless
despite all this style he seemed more than usually the cool easy
careless cowboy

Evenin Miss Helen he said as he stalked in Evenin Miss Bo How
are youall

Helen returned his greeting with a welcoming smile

Good eveningTOM said Bo demurely

That assuredly was the first time she had ever called him Tom As she
spoke she looked distractingly pretty and tantalizing But if she had
calculated to floor Carmichael with the initial halfpromising wholly
mocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause The cowboy
received that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times
or had not heard it at all Helen decided if he was acting a part he
was certainly a clever actor He puzzled her somewhat but she liked his
look and his easy manner and the something about him that must have
been his unconscious sense of pride He had gone far enough perhaps too
far in his overtures to Bo

How are you feelin he asked

Im better today she replied with downcast eyes But Im lame
yet

Reckon that bronc piled you up Miss Helen said there shore wasnt any
joke about the cut on your knee Now a fellars knee is a bad place to
hurt if he has to keep on ridin

Oh Ill be well soon Hows Sam I hope he wasnt crippled

Thet Samwhy hes so tough he never knowed he had a fall

TomII want to thank you for giving Riggs what he deserved

She spoke it earnestly eloquently and for once she had no sly little
intonation or pert allurement such as was her wont to use on this
infatuated young man

Aw you heard about that replied Carmichael with a wave of his hand
to make light of it Nothin much It had to be done An shore I was
afraid of Roy Hed been bad An so would any of the other boys Im
sorta lookin out for all of them you know actin as Miss Helens
foreman now

Helen was unutterably tickled The effect of his speech upon Bo was
stupendous He had disarmed her He had with the finesse and tact
and suavity of a diplomat removed himself from obligation and the
detachment of self the casual thing be apparently made out of his
magnificent championship was bewildering and humiliating to Bo She
sat silent for a moment or two while Helen tried to fit easily into
the conversation It was not likely that Bo would long be at a loss
for words and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her
wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a
twinkling Anyway plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep She looked
startled hurt wistful and finally sweetly defiant

Butyou told Riggs I was your girl Thus Bo unmasked her battery And
Helen could not imagine how Carmichael would ever resist that and the
soft arch glance which accompanied it

Helen did not yet know the cowboy any more than did Bo

Shore I had to say thet I had to make it strong before thet gang I
reckon it was presumin of me an I shore apologize

Bo stared at him and then giving a little gasp she drooped

Wal I just run in to say howdy an to inquire after youall said
Carmichael Im goin to the dance an as Flo lives out of town a ways
Id shore better rustle Good night Miss Bo I hope youll be ridin
Sam soon An good night Miss Helen

Bo roused to a very friendly and laconic little speech much overdone
Carmichael strode out and Helen bidding him goodby closed the door
after him

The instant he had departed Bos transformation was tragic

Flo He meant Flo Stubbsthat ugly crosseyed bold little frump

Bo expostulated Helen The young lady is not beautiful I grant but
shes very nice and pleasant I liked her

Nell Rayner men are no good And cowboys are the worst declared Bo
terribly

Why didnt you appreciate Tom when you had him asked Helen

Bo had been growing furious but now the allusion in past tense to
the conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her
spirit It was a very pale unsteady and miserable girl who avoided
Helens gaze and left the room

Next day Bo was not approachable from any direction Helen found her
a victim to a multiplicity of moods ranging from woe to dire dark
broodings from them to wistfulness and at last to a pride that
sustained her

Late in the afternoon at Helens leisure hour when she and Bo were in
the sittingroom horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted
the porch Opening to a loud knock Helen was surprised to see Beasley
And out in the court were several mounted horsemen Helens heart sank
This visit indeed had been foreshadowed

Afternoon Miss Rayner said Beasley doffing his sombrero Ive
called on a little business deal Will you see me

Helen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly She might
just as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with

Come in she said and when he had entered she closed the door My
sister Mr Beasley

How d you do Miss said the rancher in bluff loud voice

Bo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow

At close range Beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather
handsome man of perhaps thirtyfive heavy of build swarthy of skin
and sloeblack of eye like that of the Mexicans whose blood was
reported to be in him He looked crafty confident and selfcentered
If Helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have
distrusted him

Id called sooner but I was waitin for old Jose the Mexican who
herded for me when I was pardner to your uncle said Beasley and he
sat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees

Yes queried Helen interrogatively

Jose rustled over from Magdalena an now I can back up my claim
Miss Rayner this hyar ranch ought to be mine an is mine It wasnt so
big or so well stocked when Al Auchincloss beat me out of it I reckon
Ill allow for thet Ive papers an old Jose for witness An I
calculate youll pay me eighty thousand dollars or else Ill take over
the ranch

Beasley spoke in an ordinary matteroffact tone that certainly seemed
sincere and his manner was blunt but perfectly natural

Mr Beasley your claim is no news to me responded Helen quietly
Ive heard about it And I questioned my uncle He swore on his
deathbed that he did not owe you a dollar Indeed he claimed the
indebtedness was yours to him I could find nothing in his papers so I
must repudiate your claim I will not take it seriously

Miss Rayner I cant blame you for takin Als word against mine said
Beasley An your stand is natural But youre a stranger here an you
know nothin of stock deals in these ranges It aint fair to speak
bad of the dead but the truth is thet Al Auchincloss got his start by
stealin sheep an unbranded cattle Thet was the start of every rancher
I know It was mine An we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin

Helen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement

Talks cheap anywhere an in the West talk aint much at all
continued Beasley Im no talker I jest want to tell my case an make
a deal if youll have it I can prove more in black an white an with
witness than you can Thets my case The deal Id make is this
Lets marry an settle a bad deal thet way

The mans direct assumption absolutely without a qualifying
consideration for her womans attitude was amazing ignorant and base
but Helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust

Thank you Mr Beasley but I cant accept your offer she replied

Would you take time an consider he asked spreading wide his huge
gloved hands

Absolutely no

Beasley rose to his feet He showed no disappointment or chagrin but
the bold pleasantness left his face and slight as that change was it
stripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed

Thet means Ill force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you
off he said

Mr Beasley even if I owed you that how could I raise so enormous a
sum I dont owe it And I certainly wont be put off my property You
cant put me off

An why cant I he demanded with lowering dark gaze

Because your claim is dishonest And I can prove it declared Helen
forcibly

Who re you goin to prove it tothet Im dishonest

To my mento your mento the people of Pineto everybody Theres
not a person who wont believe me

He seemed curious discomfited surlily annoyed and yet fascinated
by her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she
spiritedly defended her cause

An how re you goin to prove all thet he growled

Mr Beasley do you remember last fall when you met Snake Anson with
his gang up in the woodsand hired him to make off with me asked
Helen in swift ringing words

The dark olive of Beasleys bold face shaded to a dirty white

Whaat he jerked out hoarsely

I see you remember Well Milt Dale was hidden in the loft of that
cabin where you met Anson He heard every word of your deal with the
outlaw

Beasley swung his arm in sudden violence so hard that he flung his
glove to the floor As he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant
hiss Then stalking to the door he jerked it open and slammed it
behind him His loud voice hoarse with passion preceded the scrape and
crack of hoofs


Shortly after supper that day when Helen was just recovering her
composure Carmichael presented himself at the open door Bo was not
there In the dimming twilight Helen saw that the cowboy was pale
somber grim

Oh whats happened cried Helen

Roys been shot It come off in Turners saloon But he aint dead We
packed him over to Widow Casss An he said for me to tell you hed
pull through

Shot Pull through repeated Helen in slow unrealizing exclamation
She was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood
in all her external body

Yes shot replied Carmichael fiercely

An whatever he says I reckon he wont pull through

O Heaven how terrible burst out Helen He was so goodsuch a
man What a pity Oh he must have met that in my behalf Tell me what
happened Who shot him

Wal I dont know An thets whats made me hoppin mad I wasnt
there when it come off An he wont tell me

Why not

I dont know thet either I reckoned first it was because he wanted
to get even But after thinkin it over I guess he doesnt want me
lookin up any one right now for fear I might get hurt An youre goin
to need your friends Thets all I can make of Roy

Then Helen hurriedly related the event of Beasleys call on her that
afternoon and all that had occurred

Wal the halfbreed sonofagreaser ejaculated Carmichael in utter
confoundment He wanted you to marry him

He certainly did I must say it was aa rather abrupt proposal

Carmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered
behind his teeth At last he let out an explosive breath

Miss Nell Ive shore felt in my bones thet Im the boy slated to brand
thet big bull

Oh he must have shot Roy He left here in a rage

I reckon you can coax it out of Roy Fact is all I could learn was
thet Roy come in the saloon alone Beasley was there an Riggs

Riggs interrupted Helen

Shore Riggs He come back again But hed better keep out of my
way An Jeff Mulvey with his outfit Turner told me he heard an
argument an then a shot The gang cleared out leavin Roy on the
floor I come in a little later Roy was still layin there Nobody was
doin anythin for him An nobody had I hold that against Turner Wal
I got help an packed Roy over to Widow Casss Roy seemed all right
But he was too bright an talky to suit me The bullet hit his lung
thets shore An he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it Thet
skunk Turner might have lent a hand An if Roy croaks I reckon Ill

Tom why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody demanded
Helen angrily

Cause somebodys got to be killed round here Thets why he snapped
back

Even soshould you risk leaving Bo and me without a friend asked
Helen reproachfully

At that Carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness

Aw Miss Nell Im only mad If youll just be patient with mean
mebbe coax me But I cant see no other way out

Lets hope and pray said Helen earnestly You spoke of my coaxing
Roy to tell who shot him When can I see him

Tomorrow I reckon Ill come for you Fetch Bo along with you Weve
got to play safe from now on An what do you say to me an Hal sleepin
here at the ranchhouse

Indeed Id feel safer she replied There are rooms Please come

Allright An now Ill be goin to fetch Hal Shore wish I hadnt made
you pale an scared like this


About ten oclock next morning Carmichael drove Helen and Bo into Pine
and tied up the team before Widow Casss cottage

The peach and appletrees were mingling blossoms of pink and white a
drowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air rich darkgreen alfalfa
covered the small orchard flat a wood fire sent up a lazy column of
blue smoke and birds were singing sweetly

Helen could scarcely believe that amid all this tranquillity a man
lay perhaps fatally injured Assuredly Carmichael had been somber and
reticent enough to rouse the gravest fears

Widow Cass appeared on the little porch a gray bent worn but
cheerful old woman whom Helen had come to know as her friend

My land Im thet glad to see you Miss Helen she said An youve
fetched the little lass as Ive not got acquainted with yet

Good morning Mrs Cass Howhow is Roy replied Helen anxiously
scanning the wrinkled face

Roy Now dont you look so scared Roys most ready to git on his hoss
an ride home if I let him He knowed you was acomin An he made
me hold a lookinglass for him to shave Hows thet fer a man with a
bullethole through him You cant kill them Mormons nohow

She led them into a little sittingroom where on a couch underneath a
window Roy Beeman lay He was wide awake and smiling but haggard He
lay partly covered with a blanket His gray shirt was open at the neck
disclosing bandages

Morningirls he drawled Shore is good of you now comin down

Helen stood beside him bent over him in her earnestness as she
greeted him She saw a shade of pain in his eyes and his immobility
struck her but he did not seem badly off Bo was pale roundeyed and
apparently too agitated to speak Carmichael placed chairs beside the
couch for the girls

Wal whats ailin you this nice mornin asked Roy eyes on the
cowboy

Huh Would you expect me to be wearin the smile of a fellar goin to
be married retorted Carmichael

Shore you havent made up with Bo yet returned Roy

Bo blushed rosy red and the cowboys face lost something of its somber
hue

I allow its none of your ddarn bizness if SHE aint made up with
me he said

Las Vegas youre a wonder with a hoss an a rope an I reckon with a
gun but when it comes to girls you shore aint there

Im no Mormon by golly Come Ma Cass lets get out of here so they
can talk

Folks I was jest agoin to say thet Roys got fever an he oughtnt
t talk too much said the old woman Then she and Carmichael went into
the kitchen and closed the door

Roy looked up at Helen with his keen eyes more kindly piercing than
ever

My brother John was here Hed just left when you come He rode home
to tell my folks Im not so bad hurt an then hes goin to ride a
beeline into the mountains

Helens eyes asked what her lips refused to utter

Hes goin after Dale I sent him I reckoned weall sorta needed sight
of thet doggone hunter

Roy had averted his gaze quickly to Bo

Dont you agree with me lass

I sure do replied Bo heartily

All within Helen had been stilled for the moment of her realization and
then came swell and beat of heart and inconceivable chafing of a tide
at its restraint

Can Johnfetch Dale outwhen the snows so deep she asked
unsteadily

Shore Hes takin two hosses up to the snowline Then if necessary
hell go over the pass on snowshoes But I bet him Dale would ride out
Snows about gone except on the north slopes an on the peaks

Thenwhen may Iwe expect to see Dale

Three or four days I reckon I wish he was here now Miss Helen
theres trouble afoot

I realize that Im ready Did Las Vegas tell you about Beasleys visit
to me

No You tell me replied Roy

Briefly Helen began to acquaint him with the circumstances of that
visit and before she had finished she made sure Roy was swearing to
himself

He asked you to marry him Jerusalem Thet Id never have reckoned
Thelowdown coyote of a greaser Wal Miss Helen when I met up
with Senor Beasley last night he was shore spoilin from somethin now
I see what thet was An I reckon I picked out the bad time

For what Roy what did you do

Wal Id made up my mind awhile back to talk to Beasley the first
chance I had An thet was it I was in the store when I seen him go
into Turners So I followed It was most dark Beasley an Riggs an
Mulvey an some more were drinkin an powwowin So I just braced him
right then

Roy Oh the way you boys court danger

But Miss Helen thets the only way To be afraid MAKES more danger
Beasley peared civil enough first off Him an me kept edgin off
an his pards kept edgin after us till we got over in a corner of the
saloon I dont know all I said to him Shore I talked a heap I told
him what my old man thought An Beasley knowed as well as I thet my old
mans not only the oldest inhabitant hereabouts but hes the wisest
too An he wouldnt tell a lie Wal I used all his sayins in my
argument to show Beasley thet if he didnt haul up short hed end almost
as short Beasleys thickheaded an powerful conceited Vain as a
peacock He couldnt see an he got mad I told him he was rich enough
without robbin you of your ranch anwal I shore put up a big talk
for your side By this time he an his gang had me crowded in a corner
an from their looks I begun to get cold feet But I was in it an had
to make the best of it The argument worked down to his pinnin me to my
word that Id fight for you when thet fight come off An I shore told
him for my own sake I wished it d come off quick Thenwalthen
somethin did come off quick

Roy then he shot you exclaimed Helen passionately

Now Miss Helen I didnt say who done it replied Roy with his
engaging smile

Tell me thenwho did

Wal I reckon I shant tell you unless you promise not to tell Las
Vegas Thet cowboy is plumb off his head He thinks he knows who shot
me an Ive been lyin somethin scandalous You see if he learnsthen
hell go gunnin An Miss Helen thet Texan is bad He might get
plugged as I didan there would be another man put off your side when
the big trouble comes

Roy I promise you I will not tell Las Vegas replied Helen
earnestly

Wal thenit was Riggs Roy grew still paler as he confessed this and
his voice almost a whisper expressed shame and hate Thet fourflush
did it Shot me from behind Beasley I had no chance I couldnt even
see him draw But when I fell an lay there an the others dropped back
then I seen the smokin gun in his hand He looked powerful important
An Beasley began to cuss him an was cussin him as they all run out

Oh coward the despicable coward cried Helen

No wonder Tom wants to find out exclaimed Bo low and deep Ill bet
he suspects Riggs

Shore he does but I wouldnt give him no satisfaction

Roy you know that Riggs cant last out here

Wal I hope he lasts till I get on my feet again

There you go Hopeless all you boys You must spill blood murmured
Helen shudderingly

Dear Miss Helen dont take on so Im like Daleno man to hunt up
trouble But out here theres a sort of unwritten lawan eye for an
eyea tooth for a tooth I believe in God Almighty an killin is
against my religion but Riggs shot methe same as shootin me in the
back

Roy Im only a womanI fear fainthearted and unequal to this West

Wait till somethin happens to you Supposin Beasley comes an grabs
you with his own dirty big paws an after maulin you some throws you
out of your home Or supposin Riggs chases you into a corner

Helen felt the start of all her physical beinga violent leap of blood
But she could only judge of her looks from the grim smile of the wounded
man as he watched her with his keen intent eyes

My friend anythin can happen he said But lets hope it wont be
the worst

He had begun to show signs of weakness and Helen rising at once said
that she and Bo had better leave him then but would come to see him the
next day At her call Carmichael entered again with Mrs Cass and
after a few remarks the visit was terminated Carmichael lingered in the
doorway

Wal Cheer up you old Mormon he called

Cheer up yourself you cross old bachelor retorted Roy quite
unnecessarily loud Cant you raise enough nerve to make up with Bo

Carmichael evacuated the doorway as if he had been spurred He was quite
red in the face while he unhitched the team and silent during the ride
up to the ranchhouse There he got down and followed the girls into the
sitting room He appeared still somber though not sullen and had fully
regained his composure

Did you find out who shot Roy he asked abruptly of Helen

Yes But I promised Roy I would not tell replied Helen nervously
She averted her eyes from his searching gaze intuitively fearing his
next query

Was it thetRiggs

Las Vegas dont ask me I will not break my promise

He strode to the window and looked out a moment and presently when
he turned toward Bo he seemed a stronger loftier more impelling man
with all his emotions under control

Bo will you listen to meif I swear to speak the truthas I know
it

Why certainly replied Bo with the color coming swiftly to her face

Roy doesnt want me to know because he wants to meet thet fellar
himself An I want to know because I want to stop him before he can do
more dirt to us or our friends Thets Roys reason an mine An Im
askin YOU to tell me

But TomI oughtnt replied Bo haltingly

Did you promise Roy not to tell

No

Or your sister

No I didnt promise either

Wal then you tell me I want you to trust me in this here matter But
not because I love you an once had a wild dream you might care a little
for me

OhTom faltered Bo

Listen I want you to trust me because Im the one who knows whats
best I wouldnt lie an I wouldnt say so if I didnt know shore I
swear Dale will back me up But he cant be here for some days An thet
gang has got to be bluffed You ought to see this I reckon youve been
quick in savvyin Western ways I couldnt pay you no higher compliment
Bo Rayner Now will you tell me

Yes I will replied Bo with the blaze leaping to her eyes

Oh Boplease dontplease dont Wait implored Helen

Boits between you an me said Carmichael

Tom Ill tell you whispered Bo It was a lowdown cowardly
trick Roy was surroundedand shot from behind Beasleyby that
fourflush Riggs



CHAPTER XIX

The memory of a woman had ruined Milt Dales peace had confounded his
philosophy of selfsufficient lonely happiness in the solitude of the
wilds had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal
significance of life

When he realized his defeat that things were not as they seemed that
there was no joy for him in the coming of spring that he had been blind
in his free sensorial Indian relation to existence he fell into
an inexplicably strange state a despondency a gloom as deep as the
silence of his home Dale reflected that the stronger an animal the
keener its nerves the higher its intelligence the greater must be its
suffering under restraint or injury He thought of himself as a high
order of animal whose great physical need was action and now the
incentive to action seemed dead He grew lax He did not want to move
He performed his diminishing duties under compulsion

He watched for spring as a liberation but not that he could leave the
valley He hated the cold he grew weary of wind and snow he imagined
the warm sun the park once more green with grass and bright with
daisies the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts
would be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him Then he
might gradually return to past contentment though it would never be the
same

But spring coming early to Paradise Park brought a fever to Dales
blooda fire of unutterable longing It was good perhaps that
this was so because he seemed driven to work climb tramp and keep
ceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark Action strengthened his lax
muscles and kept him from those motionless senseless hours of brooding
He at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never
be histhe sweetness of a womana home full of light joy hope the
meaning and beauty of children But those dark moods were sinkings into
a pit of hell

Dale had not kept track of days and weeks He did not know when the snow
melted off three slopes of Paradise Park All he knew was that an age
had dragged over his head and that spring had come During his restless
waking hours and even when he was asleep there seemed always in the
back of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from
this trial a changed man ready to sacrifice his chosen lot to give up
his lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature
and to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service
to people Nevertheless he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness
until his ordeal was overuntil he could meet her and the world
knowing himself more of a man than ever before

One bright morning while he was at his campfire the tame cougar gave
a low growling warning Dale was startled Tom did not act like that
because of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag Presently Dale espied
a horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces And with that
sight Dales heart gave a leap recalling to him a divination of his
future relation to his kind Never had he been so glad to see a man

This visitor resembled one of the Beemans judging from the way he sat
his horse and presently Dale recognized him to be John

At this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot soon reaching
the pines and the camp

Howdy there you ole barhunter called John waving his hand

For all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from
Dale The horse was mud to his flanks and John was mud to his knees
wet bedraggled worn and white This hue of his face meant more than
fatigue

Howdy John replied Dale

They shook hands John wearily swung his leg over the pommel but did
not at once dismount His clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon
the hunter

Miltwhat n hells wrong he queried

Why

Bust me if you aint changed so I hardly knowed you Youve been
sickall alone here

Do I look sick

Wal I should smile Thin an pale an down in the mouth Milt what
ails you

Ive gone to seed

Youve gone off your head jest as Roy said livin alone here You
overdid it Milt An you look sick

John my sickness is here replied Dale soberly as he laid a hand on
his heart

Lung trouble ejaculated John With thet chest an up in this
air Get out

Nonot lung trouble said Dale

I savvy Had a hunch from Roy anyhow

What kind of a hunch

Easy now Dale ole man Dont you reckon Im ridin in on you
pretty early Look at thet hoss John slid off and waved a hand at
the drooping beast then began to unsaddle him Wal he done great We
bogged some comin over An I climbed the pass at night on the frozen
snow

Youre welcome as the flowers in May John what month is it

By spades are you as bad as thet Lets see Its the twentythird
of March

March Well Im beat Ive lost my reckoninan a lot more maybe

Thar declared John slapping the mustang You can jest hang up here
till my next trip Milt how re your hosses

Wintered fine

Wal thets good Well need two big strong hosses right off

What for queried Dale sharply He dropped a stick of wood and
straightened up from the campfire

Youre goin to ride down to Pine with methets what for

Familiarly then came back to Dale the quiet intent suggestiveness of
the Beemans in moments foreboding trial

At this certain assurance of Johns too significant to be doubted
Dales thought of Pine gave slow birth to a strange sensation as if he
had been dead and was vibrating back to life

Tell what you got to tell he broke out

Quick as a flash the Mormon replied Roys been shot But he wont die
He sent for you Bad deals afoot Beasley means to force Helen Rayner
out an steal her ranch

A tremor ran all through Dale It seemed another painful yet thrilling
connection between his past and this vaguely calling future His
emotions had been broodings dreams longings This thing his friend said
had the sting of real life

Then old Als dead he asked

Long agoI reckon around the middle of February The property went to
Helen Shes been doin fine An many folks say its a pity shell lose
it

She wont lose it declared Dale How strange his voice sounded to his
own ears It was hoarse and unreal as if from disuse

Wal weall have our idees I say she will My father says so
Carmichael says so

Whos he

Reckon you remember thet cowpuncher who came up with Roy an
Auchincloss after the girlslast fall

Yes They called him LasLas Vegas I liked his looks

Humph Youll like him a heap when you know him Hes kept the ranch
goin for Miss Helen all along But the deals comin to a head
Beasleys got thick with thet Riggs You remember him

Yes

Wal hes been hangin out at Pine all winter watchin for some chance
to get at Miss Helen or Bo Everybodys seen thet An jest lately he
chased Bo on hossbackgave the kid a nasty fall Roy says Riggs was
after Miss Helen But I think one or tother of the girls would do thet
varmint Wal thet sorta started goinson Carmichael beat Riggs an
drove him out of town But he come back Beasley called on Miss Helen
an offered to marry her sos not to take the ranch from her he said

Dale awoke with a thundering curse

Shore exclaimed John Id say the sameonly Im religious Dont
thet beadyeyed greasers gall make you want to spit all over yourself
My Gawd but Roy was mad Roys powerful fond of Miss Helen an Bo
Wal then Roy first chance he got braced Beasley an give him some
straight talk Beasley was foamin at the mouth Roy said It was then
Riggs shot Roy Shot him from behind Beasley when Roy wasnt lookin
An Riggs brags of bein a gunfighter Mebbe thet wasnt a bad shot for
him

I reckon replied Dale as he swallowed hard Now just what was
Roys message to me

Wal I cant remember all Roy said answered John dubiously But
Roy shore was excited an dead in earnest He says Tell Milt whats
happened Tell him Helen Rayners in more danger than she was last fall
Tell him Ive seen her look away acrost the mountains toward Paradise
Park with her heart in her eyes Tell him she needs him most of all

Dale shook all over as with an attack of ague He was seized by a
whirlwind of passionate terrible sweetness of sensation when what
he wildly wanted was to curse Roy and John for their simpleminded
conclusions

Royscrazy panted Dale

Wal now Miltthets downright surprisin of you Roys the
levelheadest of any fellars I know

Man if he MADE me believe himan it turned out untrueIdId kill
him replied Dale

Untrue Do you think Roy Beeman would lie

But Johnyou fellows cant see my case Nell Rayner wants meneeds
me It cant be true

Wal my lovesick pardit jest IS true exclaimed John feelingly
Thets the hell of lifenever knowin But here its joy for you You
can believe Roy Beeman about women as quick as youd trust him to track
your lost hoss Roys married three girls I reckon hell marry some
more Roys only twentyeight an he has two big farms He said hed
seen Nell Rayners heart in her eyes lookin for youan you can jest
bet your life thets true An he said it because he means you to rustle
down there an fight for thet girl

Illgo said Dale in a shaky whisper as he sat down on a pine log
near the fire He stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his
feet while storm after storm possessed his breast They were fierce and
brief because driven by his will In those few moments of contending
strife Dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which
had made his winter a nightmare And when he stood erect again it seemed
that the old earth had a stirring electrifying impetus for his feet
Something black bitter melancholy and morbid always unreal to him
had passed away forever The great moment had been forced upon him He
did not believe Roy Beemans preposterous hint regarding Helen but he
had gone back or soared onward as if by magic to his old true self


Mounted on Dales strongest horses with only a light pack an ax and
their weapons the two men had reached the snowline on the pass by noon
that day Tom the tame cougar trotted along in the rear

The crust of the snow now half thawed by the sun would not hold
the weight of a horse though it upheld the men on foot They walked
leading the horses Travel was not difficult until the snow began to
deepen then progress slackened materially John had not been able to
pick out the line of the trail so Dale did not follow his tracks An
old blaze on the trees enabled Dale to keep fairly well to the trail
and at length the height of the pass was reached where the snow was
deep Here the horses labored plowing through foot by foot When
finally they sank to their flanks they had to be dragged and goaded
on and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their
hoofs It took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards
of deep snow on the height of the pass The cougar did not have great
difficulty in following though it was evident he did not like such
traveling

That behind them the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge
of the steep descent where they had all they could do to hold back from
sliding and rolling Fast time was made on this slope at the bottom of
which began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls
hard to locate The men here performed Herculean labors but they got
through to a park where the snow was gone The ground however soft and
boggy in places was more treacherous than the snow and the travelers
had to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite and then go on
through the forest When they reached bare and solid ground just before
dark that night it was high time for the horses were ready to drop
and the men likewise

Camp was made in an open wood Darkness fell and the men were resting
on bough beds feet to the fire with Tom curled up close by and the
horses still drooping where they had been unsaddled Morning however
discovered them grazing on the long bleached grass John shook his head
when he looked at them

You reckoned to make Pine by nightfall How far is itthe way youll
go

Fifty mile or thereabouts replied Dale

Wal we cant ride it on them critters

John wed do more than that if we had to

They were saddled and on the move before sunrise leaving snow and bog
behind Level parks and level forests led one after another to long
slopes and steep descents all growing sunnier and greener as the
altitude diminished Squirrels and grouse turkeys and deer and less
tame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced
In this game zone however Dale had trouble with Tom The cougar had to
be watched and called often to keep him off of trails

Tom doesnt like a long trip said Dale But Im goin to take him
Some way or other he may come in handy

Sic him onto Beasleys gang replied John Some men are powerful
scared of cougars But I never was

Nor me Though Ive had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin

The men talked but little Dale led the way with Tom trotting
noiselessly beside his horse John followed close behind They loped the
horses across parks trotted through the forests walked slow up
what few inclines they met and slid down the soft wet pinematted
descents So they averaged from six to eight miles an hour The horses
held up well under that steady travel and this without any rest at
noon

Dale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance Yet despite this
the same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him
strangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun
nor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir
him His mind his heart his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating
wine of expectation while his eyes and ears and nose had never been
keener to register the facts of the forestland He saw the black thing
far ahead that resembled a burned stump but he knew was a bear before
it vanished he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote and the red
of fox and the small wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above
the grass and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slowrising
blades of bluebells where some softfooted beast had just trod And he
heard the melancholy notes of birds the twitter of grouse the sough of
the wind the light dropping of pinecones the near and distant bark of
squirrels the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge
from a rival far away the cracking of twigs in the thickets the murmur
of running water the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk
and always the soft dull steady pads of the hoofs of the horses

The smells too were the sweet stinging ones of spring warm and
pleasantthe odor of the clean fresh earth cutting its way through
that thick strong fragrance of pine the smell of logs rotting in the
sun and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snowwater

I smell smoke said Dale suddenly as he reined in and turned for
corroboration from his companion

John sniffed the warm air

Wal youre more of an Injun than me he replied shaking his head

They traveled on and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope
A long league of green slanted below them breaking up into straggling
lines of trees and groves that joined the cedars and these in turn
stretched on and down in grayblack patches to the desert that
glittering and bare with streaks of somber hue faded in the obscurity
of distance

The village of Pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the
great forest and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green

Look there said Dale pointing

Some miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the
slope forming a promontory and from it a thin pale column of smoke
curled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of
green

Thets your smoke shore enough replied John thoughtfully Now I
jest wonder whos campin there No water near or grass for hosses

John that points been used for smoke signals many a time

Was jest thinkin of thet same Shall we ride around there an take a
peek

No But well remember that If Beasleys got his deep scheme goin
hell have Snake Ansons gang somewhere close

Roy said thet same Wal its some three hours till sundown The hosses
keep up I reckon Im fooled for well make Pine all right But old Tom
there hes tired or lazy

The big cougar was lying down panting and his halfshut eyes were on
Dale

Toms only lazy an fat He could travel at this gait for a week But
lets rest a halfhour an watch that smoke before movin on We can
make Pine before sundown


When travel had been resumed halfway down the slope Dales sharp eyes
caught a broad track where shod horses had passed climbing in a long
slant toward the promontory He dismounted to examine it and John
coming up proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise Dale made
his deductions after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse
waiting for John

Wal what d you make of these here tracks asked that worthy

Some horses an a pony went along here yesterday an today a single
horse made that fresh track

Wal Milt for a hunter you aint so bad at hoss tracks observed
John But how many hosses went yesterday

I couldnt make outseveralmaybe four or five

Six hosses an a colt or little mustang unshod to be strictcorrect
Wal supposin they did What s it mean to us

I dont know as Id thought anythin unusual if it hadnt been for
that smoke we saw off the rim an then this here fresh track made along
today Looks queer to me

Wish Roy was here replied John scratching his head Milt Ive a
hunch if he was hed foller them tracks

Maybe But we havent time for that We can backtrail them though if
they keep clear as they are here An well not lose any time either

That broad track led straight toward Pine down to the edge of the
cedars where amid some jagged rocks evidences showed that men had
camped there for days Here it ended as a broad trail But from the
north came the single fresh track made that very day and from the east
more in a line with Pine came two tracks made the day before And these
were imprints of big and little hoofs Manifestly these interested John
more than they did Dale who had to wait for his companion

Milt it aint a coltsthet little track avowed John

Why notan what if it isnt queried Dale

Wal it aint because a colt always straggles back an from one
side to tother This little track keeps close to the big one An by
George it was made by a led mustang

John resembled Roy Beeman then with that leaping intent fire in his
gray eyes Dales reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call
sharply to the lagging cougar

When they turned into the broad blossombordered road that was the
only thoroughfare of Pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the
mountains The horses were too tired for any more than a walk Natives
of the village catching sight of Dale and Beeman and the huge gray cat
following like a dog called excitedly to one another A group of men
in front of Turners gazed intently down the road and soon manifested
signs of excitement Dale and his comrade dismounted in front of Widow
Casss cottage And Dale called as he strode up the little path Mrs
Cass came out She was white and shaking but appeared calm At sight of
her John Beeman drew a sharp breath

Wal now he began hoarsely and left off

Hows Roy queried Dale

Lord knows Im glad to see you boys Milt youre thin an
strangelookin Roys had a little setback He got a shock today an
it throwed him off Feveran now hes out of his head It wont do
no good for you to waste time seein him Take my word for it hes
all right But theres others asFor the lands sakes Milt Dale you
fetched thet cougar back Dont let him near me

Tom wont hurt you mother said Dale as the cougar came padding up
the path You were sayin somethinabout others Is Miss Helen safe
Hurry

Ride up to see heran waste no more time here

Dale was quick in the saddle followed by John but the horses had to be
severely punished to force them even to a trot And that was a lagging
trot which now did not leave Torn behind

The ride up to Auchinclosss ranchhouse seemed endless to Dale Natives
came out in the road to watch after he had passed Stern as Dale was in
dominating his feelings he could not wholly subordinate his mounting
joy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe But no matter
what awaitednor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless
circumstance about to be disclosed the wonderful and glorious fact of
the present was that in a moment he would see Helen Rayner

There were saddled horses in the courtyard but no riders A Mexican
boy sat on the porch bench in the seat where Dale remembered he had
encountered Al Auchincloss The door of the big sittingroom was open
The scent of flowers the murmur of bees the pounding of hoofs came
vaguely to Dale His eyes dimmed so that the ground when he slid out
of his saddle seemed far below him He stepped upon the porch His
sight suddenly cleared A tight fullness at his throat made incoherent
the words he said to the Mexican boy But they were understood as the
boy ran back around the house Dale knocked sharply and stepped over the
threshold

Outside John true to his habits was thinking even in that moment of
suspense about the faithful exhausted horses As he unsaddled them he
talked Fer soft an fat hosses winterin high up wal youve done
somethin

Then Dale heard a voice in another room a step a creak of the door It
opened A woman in white appeared He recognized Helen But instead of
the rich brown bloom and darkeyed beauty so hauntingly limned on
his memory he saw a white beautiful face strained and quivering in
anguish and eyes that pierced his heart He could not speak

Oh my friendyouve come she whispered

Dale put out a shaking hand But she did not see it She clutched his
shoulders as if to feel whether or not he was real and then her arms
went up round his neck

Oh thank God I knew you would come she said and her head sank to
his shoulder

Dale divined what he had suspected Helens sister had been carried off
Yet while his quick mind grasped Helens broken spiritthe unbalance
that was reason for this marvelous and glorious acthe did not
take other meaning of the embrace to himself He just stood there
transported charged like a tree struck by lightning making sure with
all his keen senses so that he could feel forever how she was clinging
round his neck her face over his bursting heart her quivering form
close pressed to his

ItsBo he said unsteadily

She went riding yesterdayandnevercameback replied Helen
brokenly

Ive seen her trail Shes been taken into the woods Ill find her
Ill fetch her back he replied rapidly

With a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning With another shock she
raised her faceleaned back a little to look at him

Youll find herfetch her back

Yes he answered instantly

With that ringing word it seemed to Dale she realized how she was
standing He felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back
while the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of
scarlet But she was brave in her confusion Her eyes never fell though
they changed swiftly darkening with shame amaze and with feelings he
could not read

Im almostout of my head she faltered

No wonder I saw that But now you must get clearheaded Ive no
time to lose

He led her to the door

John its Bo thats gone he called Since yesterday Send the
boy to get me a bag of meat an bread You run to the corral an get
me a fresh horse My old horse Ranger if you can find him quick An
rustle

Without a word John leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just
unsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard

Then the big cougar seeing Helen got up from where he lay on the porch
and came to her

Oh its Tom cried Helen and as he rubbed against her knees she
patted his head with trembling hand You big beautiful pet Oh how I
remember Oh how Bo would love to

Wheres Carmichael interrupted Dale Out huntin Bo

Yes It was he who missed her first He rode everywhere yesterday Last
night when he came back he was wild Ive not seen him today He made
all the other men but Hal and Joe stay home on the ranch

Right An John must stay too declared Dale But its strange
Carmichael ought to have found the girls tracks She was ridin a
pony

Bo rode Sam Hes a little bronc very strong and fast

I come across his tracks Howd Carmichael miss them

He didnt He found themtrailed them all along the north range
Thats where he forbade Bo to go You see theyre in love with each
other Theyve been at odds Neither will give in Bo disobeyed him
Theres hard ground off the north range so he said He was able to
follow her tracks only so far

Were there any other tracks along with hers

No

Miss Helen I found them way southeast of Pine up on the slope of the
mountain There were seven other horses makin that trailwhen we run
across it On the way down we found a camp where men had waited An
Bos pony led by a rider on a big horse come into that camp from the
eastmaybe north a little An that tells the story

Riggs ran her downmade off with her cried Helen passionately Oh
the villain He had men in waiting Thats Beasleys work They were
after me

It may not be just what you said but thats close enough An Bos
in a bad fix You must face that an try to bear up underfears of the
worst

My friend You will save her

Ill fetch her back alive or dead

Dead Oh my God Helen cried and closed her eyes an instant to open
them burning black But Bo isnt dead I know thatI feel it Shell
not die very easy Shes a little savage She has no fear Shed fight
like a tigress for her life Shes strong You remember how strong She
can stand anything Unless they murder her outright shell livea long
timethrough any ordeal So I beg you my friend dont lose an
hourdont ever give up

Dale trembled under the clasp of her hands Loosing his own from her
clinging hold he stepped out on the porch At that moment John appeared
on Ranger coming at a gallop

Nell Ill never come back without her said Dale I reckon you can
hopeonly be prepared Thats all Its hard But these damned deals
are common out here in the West

Suppose Beasley comeshere exclaimed Helen and again her hand went
out toward him

If he does you refuse to get off replied Dale But dont let him
or his greasers put a dirty hand on you Should he threaten forcewhy
pack some clothesan your valuablesan go down to Mrs Casss An
wait till I come back

Waittill youcome back she faltered slowly turning white again
Her dark eyes dilated Miltyoure like Las Vegas Youll kill
Beasley

Dale heard his own laugh very cold and strange foreign to his ears A
grim deadly hate of Beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt
for this distressed girl It was a sore trial to see her leaning there
against the doorto be compelled to leave her alone Abruptly be
stalked off the porch Tom followed him The black horse whinnied his
recognition of Dale and snorted at sight of the cougar Just then the
Mexican boy returned with a bag Dale tied this with the small pack
behind the saddle

John you stay here with Miss Helen said Dale An if Carmichael
comes back keep him too An tonight if any one rides into Pine from
the way we come you be sure to spot him

Ill do thet Milt responded John

Dale mounted and turning for a last word to Helen he felt the
words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and
brokenhearted with her hands to her bosom He could not look twice

Come on there you Tom he called to the cougar Reckon on this track
youll pay me for all my trainin of you

Oh my friend came Helens sad voice almost a whisper to his
throbbing ears Heaven help youto save her I

Then Ranger started and Dale heard no more He could not look back His
eyes were full of tears and his breast ached By a tremendous effort he
shifted that emotioncalled on all the spiritual energy of his being to
the duty of this grim task before him

He did not ride down through the village but skirted the northern
border and worked round to the south where coming to the trail he had
made an hour past he headed on it straight for the slope now darkening
in the twilight The big cougar showed more willingness to return on
this trail than he had shown in the coming Ranger was fresh and wanted
to go but Dale held him in

A cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night
Against the brightening stars Dale saw the promontory lift its bold
outline It was miles away It haunted him strangely calling A night
and perhaps a day separated him from the gang that held Bo Rayner
prisoner Dale had no plan as yet He had only a motive as great as the
love he bore Helen Rayner

Beasleys evil genius had planned this abduction Riggs was a tool a
cowardly knave dominated by a stronger will Snake Anson and his gang
had lain in wait at that cedar camp had made that broad hoof track
leading up the mountain Beasley had been there with them that very day
All this was as assured to Dale as if he had seen the men

But the matter of Dales recovering the girl and doing it speedily
strung his mental strength to its highest pitch Many outlines of action
flashed through his mind as he rode on peering keenly through the
night listening with practised ears All were rejected And at the
outset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the
gray form of the cougar long graceful heavy as he padded beside the
horse From the first thought of returning to help Helen Rayner he had
conceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his
pet Tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing but he had never
been tried on men Dale believed he could make him trail anything yet
he had no proof of this One fact stood out of all Dales conjectures
and it was that he had known men and brave men to fear cougars

Far up on the slope in a little hollow where water ran and there was
a little grass for Ranger to pick Dale haltered him and made ready to
spend the night He was sparing with his food giving Tom more than he
took himself Curled close up to Dale the big cat went to sleep

But Dale lay awake for long

The night was still with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered
slope Dale saw hope in the stars He did not seem to have promised
himself or Helen that he could save her sister and then her property
He seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled outside of his
thinking Strange how this certainty was not vague yet irreconcilable
with any plans he created Behind it somehow nameless with
inconceivable power surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest of
trails of scents of night of the nature of men lying down to sleep in
the dark lonely woods of the nature of this great cat that lived its
every action in accordance with his will

He grew sleepy and gradually his mind stilled with his last conscious
thought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task



CHAPTER XX

Young Burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in Snake Ansons
gang for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty
promontory His instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open
slopes below and to report any sight of a horse

A cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long pale
column of smoke This signalfire had been kept burning since sunrise

The preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars
back of the promontory But manifestly Anson did not expect to remain
there long For after breakfast the packs had been made up and the
horses stood saddled and bridled They were restless and uneasy tossing
bits and fighting flies The sun now halfway to meridian was hot and
no breeze blew in that sheltered spot

Shady Jones had ridden off early to fill the waterbags and had not yet
returned Anson thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever
was dealing a greasy dirty deck of cards his opponent being the
squareshaped blackvisaged Moze In lieu of money the gamblers wagered
with cedarberries each of which berries represented a pipeful of
tobacco Jim Wilson brooded under a cedartree his unshaven face a
dirty dusthue a smoldering fire in his light eyes a sullen set to his
jaw Every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at Riggs and
it seemed that a quick glance was enough Riggs paced to and fro in
the open coatless and hatless his blackbroadcloth trousers and
embroidered vest dusty and torn An enormous gun bumped awkwardly in
its sheath swinging below his hip Riggs looked perturbed His face was
sweating freely yet it was far from red in color He did not appear to
mind the sun or the flies His eyes were staring dark wild shifting
in gaze from everything they encountered But often that gaze shot back
to the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man

Bo Rayners little booted feet were tied together with one end of a
lasso and the other end trailed off over the ground Her hands were
free Her ridinghabit was dusty and disordered Her eyes blazed
defiantly out of a small pale face

Harve Riggs I wouldnt be standing in those cheap boots of yours for
a million dollars she said sarcastically Riggs took no notice of her
words

You pack that gunsheath wrong end out What have you got the gun for
anyhow she added tauntingly

Snake Anson let out a hoarse laugh and Mozes black visage opened in a
huge grin Jim Wilson seemed to drink in the girls words Sullen and
somber he bent his lean head very still as if listening

Youd better shut up said Riggs darkly

I will not shut up declared Bo

Then Ill gag you he threatened

Gag me Why you dirty lowdown twobit of a bluff she exclaimed
hotly Id like to see you try it Ill tear that long hair of yours
right off your head

Riggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching as if eager to
throttle her The girl leaned forward her face reddening her eyes
fierce

You damned little cat muttered Riggs thickly Ill gag youif you
dont stop squallin

Come on I dare you to lay a hand on me Harve Riggs Im not the
least afraid of you Cant you savvy that Youre a liar a fourflush
a sneak Why youre not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws

Riggs took two long strides and bent over her his teeth protruding in a
snarl and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head

Bos head jerked back with the force of the blow but she uttered no
cry

Are you goin to keep your jaw shut he demanded stridently and a
dark tide of blood surged up into his neck

I should smile Im not retorted Bo in cool deliberate anger
of opposition Youve roped meand youve struck me Now get a
clubstand off thereout of my reachand beat me Oh if I only knew
cuss words fit for youId call you them

Snake Anson had stopped playing cards and was watching listening with
halfdisgusted halfamused expression on his serpentlike face Jim
Wilson slowly rose to his feet If any one had observed him it would
have been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this
scene yet all the while absorbed in himself Once he loosened the
neckband of his blouse

Riggs swung his arm more violently at the girl But she dodged

You dog she hissed Oh if I only had a gun

Her face then with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame held a
tragic impelling beauty that stung Anson into remonstrance

Aw Riggs dont beat up the kid he protested Thet wont do any
good Let her alone

But shes got to shut up replied Riggs

How n hell air you goin to shet her up Mebbe if you get out of her
sight shell be quiet How about thet girl

Anson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed Bo

Have I made any kick to you or your men yet she queried

It strikes me you aint replied Anson

You wont hear me make any so long as Im treated decent said Bo
I dont know what youve got to do with Riggs He ran me downroped
medragged me to your camp Now Ive a hunch youre waiting for
Beasley

Girl your hunch s correct said Anson

Well do you know Im the wrong girl

Whats thet I reckon youre Nell Rayner who got left all old
Auchinclosss property

No Im Bo Rayner Nell is my sister She owns the ranch Beasley
wanted her

Anson cursed deep and low Under his sharp bristling eyebrows he bent
cunning green eyes upon Riggs

Say you Is what this kid says so

Yes Shes Nell Rayners sister replied Riggs doggedly

Ahuh Wal why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an off up
here to signal Beasley He aint wantin her He wants the girl who owns
the ranch Did you take one fer the othersame as thet day we was with
you

Guess I must have replied Riggs sullenly

But you knowed her from her sister afore you come to my camp

Riggs shook his head He was paler now and sweating more freely The
dank hair hung wet over his forehead His manner was that of a man
suddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place

Oh hes a liar exclaimed Bo with contemptuous ring in her voice
He comes from my country He has known Nell and me for years

Snake Anson turned to look at Wilson

Jim now hyars a queer deal this feller has rung in on us I thought
thet kid was pretty young Dont you remember Beasley told us Nell
Rayner was a handsome woman

Wal pard Anson if this heah gurl aint handsome my eyes have gone
pore drawled Wilson

Ahuh So your Texas chilvaree over the ladies is some operatin
retorted Anson with fine sarcasm But thet aint tellin me what you
think

Wal I aint tellin you what I think yet But I know thet kid aint
Nell Rayner For Ive seen her

Anson studied his righthand man for a moment then taking out his
tobaccopouch he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely
to roll a cigarette He put it between his thin lips and apparently
forgot to light it For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and
some scant sagebrush Riggs took to pacing up and down Wilson leaned
as before against the cedar The girl slowly recovered from her excess
of anger

Kid see hyar said Anson addressing the girl if Riggs knowed you
wasnt Nell an fetched you along anyhowwhat d he do thet fur

He chased mecaught me Then he saw some one after us and he hurried
to your camp He was afraidthe cur

Riggs heard her reply for he turned a malignant glance upon her

Anson I fetched her because I know Nell Rayner will give up anythin
on earth for her he said in loud voice

Anson pondered this statement with an air of considering its apparent
sincerity

Dont you believe him declared Bo Rayner bluntly Hes a liar Hes
doublecrossing Beasley and all of you

Riggs raised a shaking hand to clench it at her Keep still or it ll
be the worse for you

Riggs shut up yourself put in Anson as he leisurely rose Mebbe it
aint occurred to you thet she might have some talk interestin to me
An Im runnin this hyar camp  Now kid talk up an say what you
like

I said he was doublecrossing you all replied the girl instantly
Why Im surprised youd be caught in his company My uncle Al and
my sweetheart Carmichael and my friend Daletheyve all told me what
Western men are even down to outlaws robbers cutthroat rascals like
you And I know the West well enough now to be sure that fourflush
doesnt belong here and cant last here He went to Dodge City once
and when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man He was a
swaggering bragging drinking gunfighter He talked of the men hed
shot of the fights hed had He dressed like some of those gunthrowing
gamblers He was in love with my sister Nell She hated him He
followed us out West and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking
Indian Why Nell and I couldnt even walk to the store in the village
He rode after me out on the rangechased me For that Carmichael
called Riggss bluff down in Turners saloon Dared him to draw Cussed
him every name on the range Slapped and beat and kicked him Drove him
out of Pine And now whatever he has said to Beasley or you its a
dead sure bet hes playing his own game Thats to get hold of Nell and
if not herthen me Oh Im out of breathand Im out of names to
call him If I talked foreverId never beable todo him justice
But lend mea guna minute

Jim Wilsons quiet form vibrated with a start Anson with his admiring
smile pulled his gun and taking a couple of steps forward held it out
butt first She stretched eagerly for it and he jerked it away

Hold on there yelled Riggs in alarm

Damme Jim if she didnt mean bizness exclaimed the outlaw

Wal nowsee heah Miss Would you bore himif you hed a gun
inquired Wilson with curious interest There was more of respect in his
demeanor than admiration

No I dont want his cowardly blood on my hands replied the girl
But Id make him danceId make him run

Shore you can handle a gun

She nodded her answer while her eyes flashed hate and her resolute lips
twitched

Then Wilson made a singularly swift motion and his gun was pitched butt
first to within a foot of her hand She snatched it up cocked it aimed
it all before Anson could move But he yelled

Drop thet gun you little devil

Riggs turned ghastly as the big blue gun lined on him He also yelled
but that yell was different from Ansons

Run or dance cried the girl

The big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand She took both
hands and called derisively as she fired again The second bullet hit
at Riggss feet scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over
him He bounded heretherethen darted for the rocks A third time the
heavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked Riggs for he let out a
hoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock

Plug him Shoot off a leg yelled Snake Anson whooping and stamping
as Riggs got out of sight

Jim Wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness
that had characterized his manner toward the girl Then as Riggs
disappeared Wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girls
trembling hands She was whiter than ever but still resolute and
defiant Wilson took a glance over in the direction Riggs had hidden and
then proceeded to reload the gun Snake Ansons roar of laughter ceased
rather suddenly

Hyar Jim she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun he
protested

I reckon she aint nothin agin us replied Wilson

Ahuh You know a lot about wimmen now dont you But thet did my
heart good Jim what n earth would you have did if thet d been you
instead of Riggs

The query seemed important and amazing Wilson pondered

Shore Id stood therestockstillan never moved an eyewinker

An let her shoot ejaculated Anson nodding his long head Me too

So these rough outlaws inured to all the violence and baseness of their
dishonest calling rose to the challenging courage of a slip of a girl
She had the one thing they respectednerve

Just then a halloo from the promontory brought Anson up with a start
Muttering to himself he strode out toward the jagged rocks that hid the
outlook Moze shuffled his burly form after Anson

Miss it shore was grandthet performance of Mister Gunman Riggs
remarked Jim Wilson attentively studying the girl

Much obliged to you for lending me your gun she replied II hope I
hit hima little

Wal if you didnt sting him then Jim Wilson knows nothin about
lead

Jim Wilson Are you the manthe outlaw my uncle Al knew

Reckon I am miss Fer I knowed Al shore enough What d he say aboot
me

I remember once he was telling me about Snake Ansons gang He
mentioned you Said you were a real gunfighter And what a shame it was
you had to be an outlaw

Wal An so old Al spoke thet nice of me Its tolerable likely Ill
remember An now miss can I do anythin for you

Swift as a flash she looked at him

What do you mean

Wal shore I dont mean much Im sorry to say Nothin to make
you look like thet I hev to be an outlaw shore as youre born
Butmebbe theres a difference in outlaws

She understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden
upflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader

Please take this rope off my feet Let me walk a little Let me have
aa little privacy That fool watched every move I made I promise not
to run away And oh Im thirsty

Shore youve got sense He freed her feet and helped her get up
Therell be some fresh water any minit now if youll wait

Then he turned his back and walked over to where Riggs sat nursing a
bulletburn on his leg

Say Riggs Im takin the responsibility of loosin the girl for a
little spell She cant get away An there aint any sense in bein
mean

Riggs made no reply and went on rolling down his trousers leg lapped
a fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot Then he strode out
toward the promontory Halfway there he encountered Anson tramping
back

Beasleys comin one way an Shadys comin another Well be off this
hot point of rock by noon said the outlaw leader

Riggs went on to the promontory to look for himself

Wheres the girl demanded Anson in surprise when he got back to the
camp

Wal shes walkin round between heah an Pine drawled Wilson

Jim you let her loose

Shore I did Shes been hawgtied all the time An she said shed not
run off Id take thet girls word even to a sheepthief

Ahuh So would I for all of thet But Jim somethins workin in
you Aint you sort of rememberin a time when you was youngan mebbe
knowed pretty kids like this one

Wal if I am it ll shore turn out bad fer somebody

Anson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone

Ahuh So thets how its workin he replied and flung himself down
in the shade

Young Burt made his appearance then wiping his sallow face His
deepset hungry eyes upon which his comrades set such store roved
around the camp

Whars the gurl he queried

Jim let her go out fer a stroll replied Anson

I seen Jim was gittin softy over her Haw Haw Haw

But Snake Anson did not crack a smile The atmosphere appeared not to be
congenial for jokes a fact Burt rather suddenly divined Riggs and Moze
returned from the promontory the latter reporting that Shady Jones was
riding up close Then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached
to find a seat within ten yards of the group They waited in silence
until the expected horseman rode up with waterbottles slung on both
sides of his saddle His advent was welcome All the men were thirsty
Wilson took water to the girl before drinking himself

Thets an allfired hot ride fer water declared the outlaw Shady who
somehow fitted his name in color and impression An boss if its the
same to you I wont take it agin

Cheer up Shady Well be rustlin back in the mountains before
sundown said Anson

Hang me if that aint the cheerfulest news Ive hed in some days Hey
Moze

The blackfaced Moze nodded his shaggy head

Im sick an sore of this deal broke out Burt evidently encouraged
by his elders Ever since last fall weve been hangin roundtill
jest lately freezin in campsno moneyno drinkno grub wuth havin
All on promises

Not improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck
the note of discord Wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment
prevailing there Some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain

Burt you aint insinuatin thet I made promises inquired Anson
ominously

No boss I aint You allus said we might hit it rich But them
promises was made to you An it d be jest like thet greaser to go back
on his word now we got the gurl

Son it happens we got the wrong one Our longhaired pard hyarMister
Riggshim with the big gunhe waltzes up with this sassy kid instead
of the woman Beasley wanted

Burt snorted his disgust while Shady Jones roundly swearing pelted
the smoldering campfire with stones Then they all lapsed into surly
silence The object of their growing scorn Riggs sat a little
way apart facing none of them but maintaining as bold a front as
apparently he could muster

Presently a horse shot up his ears the first indication of scent or
sound imperceptible to the men But with this cue they all except
Wilson sat up attentively Soon the crack of ironshod hoofs on stone
broke the silence Riggs nervously rose to his feet And the others
still excepting Wilson one by one followed suit In another moment a
rangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars up to the camp and his rider
jumped off nimbly for so heavy a man

Howdy Beasley was Ansons greeting

Hello Snake old man replied Beasley as his bold snapping black
eyes swept the group He was dusty and hot and wet with sweat yet
evidently too excited to feel discomfort I seen your smoke signal
first off an jumped my hoss quick But I rode north of Pine before I
headed round this way Did you corral the girl or did Riggs Sayyou
look queer Whats wrong here You havent signaled me for nothin

Snake Anson beckoned to Bo

Come out of the shade Let him look you over

The girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her
from sight

Beasley stared aghasthis jaw dropped

Thets the kid sister of the woman I wanted he ejaculated

So weve jest been told

Astonishment still held Beasley

Told he echoed Suddenly his big body leaped with a start Who got
her Who fetched her

Why Mister Gunman Riggs hyar replied Anson with a subtle scorn

Riggs you got the wrong girl shouted Beasley You made thet mistake
once before Whatre you up to

I chased her an when I got her seein it wasnt Nell RaynerwhyI
kept her anyhow replied Riggs An Ive got a word for your ear
alone

Man youre crazyqueerin my deal thet way roared Beasley You
heard my plans Riggs this girlstealin cant be done twice Was
you drinkin or locoed or what

Beasley he was giving you the doublecross cut in Bo Rayners cool
voice

The rancher stared speechlessly at her then at Anson then at Wilson
and last at Riggs when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple
blood With one lunge he knocked Riggs flat then stood over him with a
convulsive hand at his gun

You whitelivered cardsharp Ive a notion to bore you They told
me you had a deal of your own an now I believe it

YesI had replied Riggs cautiously getting up He was ghastly But
I wasnt doublecrossin you Your deal was to get the girl away from
home so you could take possession of her property An I wanted her

What for did you fetch the sister then demanded Beasley his big jaw
bulging

Because Ive a plan to

Plan hell Youve spoiled my plan an Ive seen about enough of you
Beasley breathed hard his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward
the man who had crossed him his hand still hung low and clutching

Beasley tell them to get my horse I want to go home said Bo Rayner

Slowly Beasley turned Her words enjoined a silence What to do with her
now appeared a problem

I had nothin to do with fetchin you here an Ill have nothin to do
with sendin you back or whatevers done with you declared Beasley

Then the girls face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire

Youre as big a liar as Riggs she cried passionately And youre
a thief a bully who picks on defenseless girls Oh we know your game
Milt Dale heard your plot with this outlaw Anson to steal my sister You
ought to be hangedyou halfbreed greaser

Ill cut out your tongue hissed Beasley

Yes Ill bet you would if you had me alone But these outlawsthese
sheepthievesthese tools you hire are better than you and Riggs
What do you suppose Carmichael will do to you Carmichael Hes my
sweetheartthat cowboy You know what he did to Riggs Have you brains
enough to know what hell do to you

Hell not do much growled Beasley But the thick purplish blood was
receding from his face Your cowpuncher

Bah she interrupted and she snapped her fingers in his face Hes
from Texas Hes from TEXAS

Supposin he is from Texas demanded Beasley in angry irritation
Whats thet Texans are all over Theres Jim Wilson Snake Ansons
righthand man Hes from Texas But thet aint scarin any one

He pointed toward Wilson who shifted uneasily from foot to foot The
girls flaming glance followed his hand

Are you from Texas she asked

Yes Miss I aman I reckon I dont deserve it replied Wilson It
was certain that a vague shame attended his confession

Oh I believed even a bandit from Texas would fight for a helpless
girl she replied in withering scorn of disappointment

Jim Wilson dropped his head If any one there suspected a serious
turn to Wilsons attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw
leader

Beasley youre courtin death he broke in

You bet you are added Bo with a passion that made her listeners
quiver Youve put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws You may force
my sister out of her home But your day will come Tom Carmichael will
KILL you

Beasley mounted his horse Sullen livid furious he sat shaking in the
saddle to glare down at the outlaw leader

Snake thets no fault of mine the deals miscarried I was square I
made my offer for the workin out of my plan It aint been done Now
theres hell to pay an Im through

Beasley I reckon I couldnt hold you to anythin replied Anson
slowly But if you was square you aint square now Weve hung around
an tried hard My men are all sore An were broke with no outfit to
speak of Me an you never fell out before But I reckon we might

Do I owe you any moneyaccordin to the deal demanded Beasley

No you dont responded Anson sharply

Then thets square I wash my hands of the whole deal Make Riggs pay
up Hes got money an hes got plans Go in with him

With that Beasley spurred his horse wheeled and rode away The outlaws
gazed after him until he disappeared in the cedars

Whatd you expect from a greaser queried Shady Jones

Anson didnt I say so added Burt

The blackvisaged Moze rolled his eyes like a mad bull and Jim Wilson
studiously examined a stick he held in his hands Riggs showed immense
relief

Anson stake me to some of your outfit an Ill ride off with the
girl he said eagerly

Whered you go now queried Anson curiously

Riggs appeared at a loss for a quick answer his wits were no more equal
to this predicament than his nerve

Youre no woodsman An onless youre plumb locoed youd never risk
goin near Pine or Show Down Therell be real trackers huntin your
trail

The listening girl suddenly appealed to Wilson

Dont let him take me offalonein the woods she faltered That was
the first indication of her weakening

Jim Wilson broke into gruff reply Im not bossin this gang

But youre a man she importuned

Riggs you fetch along your precious firebrand an come with us said
Anson craftily Im particular curious to see her brand you

Snake lemme take the girl back to Pine said Jim Wilson

Anson swore his amaze

Its sense continued Wilson Weve shore got our own troubles an
keepin her ll only add to them Ive a hunch Now you know I aint
often givin to buckin your sayso But this deal aint tastin good to
me Thet girl ought to be sent home

But mebbe theres somethin in it for us Her sister d pay to git her
back

Wal I shore hope youll recollect I offeredthets all concluded
Wilson

Jim if we wanted to git rid of her wed let Riggs take her off
remonstrated the outlaw leader He was perturbed and undecided Wilson
worried him

The long Texan veered around full faced What subtle transformation in
him

Like hell we would he said

It could not have been the tone that caused Anson to quail He might
have been leader here but he was not the greater man His face clouded

Break camp he ordered

Riggs had probably not heard that last exchange between Anson and
Wilson for he had walked a few rods aside to get his horse

In a few moments when they started off Burt Jones and Moze were in
the lead driving the packhorses Anson rode next the girl came between
him and Riggs and significantly it seemed Jim Wilson brought up the
rear

This start was made a little after the noon hour They zigzagged up the
slope took to a deep ravine and followed it up to where it headed in
the level forest From there travel was rapid the packhorses being
driven at a jogtrot Once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket
into a glade to stand with ears high young Burt halted the cavalcade
His wellaimed shot brought down a deer Then the men rode on leaving
him behind to dress and pack the meat The only other halt made was at
the crossing of the first water a clear swift brook where both horses
and men drank thirstily Here Burt caught up with his comrades

They traversed glade and park and wended a crooked trail through the
deepening forest and climbed bench after bench to higher ground
while the sun sloped to the westward lower and redder Sunset had gone
and twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when Anson
breaking his silence of the afternoon ordered a halt

The place was wild dismal a shallow vale between dark slopes of
spruce Grass firewood and water were there in abundance All the
men were off throwing saddles and packs before the tired girl made an
effort to get down Riggs observing her made a not ungentle move to
pull her off She gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand

Keep your paws to yourself she said No evidence of exhaustion was
there in her spirit

Wilson had observed this byplay but Anson had not

What come off he asked

Wal the Honorable Gunman Riggs jest got caressed by the ladyas he
was doin the elegant replied Moze who stood nearest

Jim was you watchin queried Anson His curiosity had held through
the afternoon

He tried to yank her off an she biffed him replied Wilson

That Riggs is jest daffy or plain locoed said Snake in an aside to
Moze

Boss you mean plain cussed Mark my words hell hoodoo this outfit
Jim was figgerin correct

Hoodoo cursed Anson under his breath

Many hands made quick work In a few moments a fire was burning
brightly water was boiling pots were steaming the odor of venison
permeated the cool air The girl had at last slipped off her saddle to
the ground where she sat while Riggs led the horse away She sat there
apparently forgotten a pathetic droop to her head

Wilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces
One by one they fell with swish and soft crash Then the sliding ring
of the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps
Presently he appeared in the semidarkness dragging halftrimmed
spruces behind him He made several trips the last of which was to
stagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs These he spread under a
low projecting branch of an aspen Then he leaned the bushy spruces
slantingly against this branch on both sides quickly improvising a
Vshaped shelter with narrow aperture in front Next from one of
the packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter Then
touching the girl on the shoulder he whispered

When youre ready slip in there An dont lose no sleep by worryin
fer Ill be layin right here

He made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow
aperture

Oh thank you Maybe you really are a Texan she whispered back

Mebbe was his gloomy reply



CHAPTER XXI

The girl refused to take food proffered her by Riggs but she ate and
drank a little that Wilson brought her then she disappeared in the
spruce leanto

Whatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in
Snake Ansons gang were not manifest in this camp Each man seemed
preoccupied as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not
clear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows They all smoked
Then Moze and Shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire but it
was a dull game in which either seldom spoke Riggs sought his blanket
first and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from
the spruce shelter which contained Bo Rayner Presently young Burt went
off grumbling to his bed And not long afterward the cardplayers did
likewise

Snake Anson and Jim Wilson were left brooding in silence beside the
dying campfire

The night was dark with only a few stars showing A fitful wind moaned
unearthly through the spruce An occasional thump of hoof sounded from
the dark woods No cry of wolf or coyote or cat gave reality to the
wildness of forestland

By and by those men who had rolled in their blankets were breathing deep
and slow in heavy slumber

Jim I take it this hyar Riggs has queered our deal said Snake Anson
in low voice

I reckon replied Wilson

An Im feared hes queered this hyar White Mountain country fer us

Shore I aint got so far as thet What d ye mean Snake

Damme if I savvy was the gloomy reply I only know what was bad
looks growin wuss Last fallan winteran now its near April
Weve got no outfit to make a long stand in the woods Jim jest how
strong is thet Beasley down in the settlements

Ive a hunch he aint half as strong as he bluffs

Me too I got thet idee yesterday He was scared of the kidwhen she
fired up an sent thet hotshot about her cowboy sweetheart killin him
Hell do it Jim I seen that Carmichael at Magdalena some years ago
Then he was only a youngster But whew Mebbe he wasnt bad after
toyin with a little red liquor

Shore He was from Texas she said

Jim I savvied your feelins was hurtby thet talk about Texasan
when she up an asked you

Wilson had no rejoinder for this remark

Wal Lord knows I aint wonderin You wasnt a hunted outlaw all
your life An neither was I Wilson I never was keen on this girl
dealnow was I

I reckon its honest to say no to thet replied Wilson But its
done Beasley ll get plugged sooner or later Thet wont help us any
Chasin sheepherders out of the country an stealin sheepthet aint
stealin gurls by a long sight Beasley ll blame that on us an be
greaser enough to send some of his men out to hunt us For Pine an Show
Down wont stand thet long Theres them Mormons Theyll be hell when
they wake up Suppose Carmichael got thet hunter Dale an them hawkeyed
Beemans on our trail

Wal wed cash inquick replied Anson gruffly

Then why didnt you let me take the gurl back home

Wal come to think of thet Jim Im sore an I need moneyan I
knowed youd never take a dollar from her sister An Ive made up my
mind to git somethin out of her

Snake youre no fool How ll you do thet same an do it quick

Aint reckoned it out yet

Wal you got aboot tomorrer an thets all returned Wilson
gloomily

Jim whats ailin you

Ill let you figger thet out

Wal somethin ails the whole gang declared Anson savagely
With them its nothin to eatno whiskyno money to bet withno
tobacco But thets not whats ailin you Jim Wilson nor me

Wal what is then queried Wilson

With me its a strange feelin thet my days over on these ranges I
cant explain but it jest feels so Somethin in the air I dont like
them dark shadows out there under the spruces Savvy An as fer you
Jimwal you allus was half decent an my gangs got too lowdown fer
you

Snake did I ever fail you

No you never did Youre the best pard I ever knowed In the years
weve rustled together we never had a contrary word till I let Beasley
fill my ears with his promises Thets my fault But Jim its too
late

It mightnt have been too late yesterday

Mebbe not But it is now an Ill hang on to the girl or git her worth
in gold declared the outlaw grimly

Snake Ive seen stronger gangs than yours come an go Them Big Bend
gangs in my countrythem rustlersthey were all bad men You have no
likes of them gangs out heah If they didnt get wiped out by Rangers
or cowboys why they jest naturally wiped out themselves Thets a law I
recognize in relation to gangs like them An as for yourswhy Anson
it wouldnt hold water against one real gunslinger

Ahuh Then if we ran up agin Carmichael or some such fellarwould
you be suckin your finger like a baby

Wal I wasnt takin count of myself I was takin generalities

Aw what n hell are them asked Anson disgustedly Jim I know as
well as you thet this hyar gang is hard put Were goin to be trailed
an chased Weve got to hidebe on the go all the timehere an
thereall over in the roughest woods An wait our chance to work
south

Shore But Snake you aint takin no count of the feelins of the
menan of mine an yours Ill bet you my hoss thet in a day or so
this gang will go to pieces

Im feared you spoke whats been crowdin to git in my mind replied
Anson Then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation
The outlaw was brave but all men of the wilds recognized a force
stronger than themselves He sat there resembling a brooding snake with
basilisk eyes upon the fire At length he arose and without another
word to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark quiet forms
of the sleepers

Jim Wilson remained beside the flickering fire He was reading something
in the red embers perhaps the past Shadows were on his face not all
from the fading flames or the towering spruces Ever and anon he raised
his head to listen not apparently that he expected any unusual sound
but as if involuntarily Indeed as Anson had said there was something
nameless in the air The black forest breathed heavily in fitful moans
of wind It had its secrets The glances Wilson threw on all sides
betrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night though it hid
him Wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black
circle of spruce He might have been reflecting on the strange reaction
happening to every man in that group since a girl had been brought
among them Nothing was clear however the forest kept its secret as
did the melancholy wind the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts
with their dark secrets locked in their hearts

After a while Wilson put some sticks on the red embers then pulled the
end of a log over them A blaze sputtered up changing the dark circle
and showing the sleepers with their set shadowed faces upturned Wilson
gazed on all of them a sardonic smile on his lips and then his look
fixed upon the sleeper apart from the othersRiggs It might have been
the false light of flame and shadow that created Wilsons expression of
dark and terrible hate Or it might have been the truth expressed
in that lonely unguarded hour from the depths of a man born in the
Southa man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all
womanhoodby whose strange wild outlawed bloody life of a gunfighter
he must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his
fame

It was a long gaze Wilson rested upon Riggsas strange and secretive as
the forest wind moaning down the great aislesand when that dark gaze
was withdrawn Wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one
ill whom spirit had liberated force

He laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had
entered and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily
stretched his long length to rest

The campfire blazed up showing the exquisite green and brownflecked
festooning of the spruce branches symmetrical and perfect yet so
irregular and then it burned out and died down leaving all in the dim
gray starlight The horses were not moving around the moan of night
wind had grown fainter the low hum of insects was dying away even
the tinkle of the brook had diminished And that growth toward absolute
silence continued yet absolute silence was never attained Life abided
in the forest only it had changed its form for the dark hours


Ansons gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour
common to all woodsmen hunters or outlaws to whom the break of day
was welcome These companionsAnson and Riggs includedmight have
hated to see the dawn come It meant only another meager meal then
the weary packing and the long long ride to nowhere in particular
and another meager mealall toiled for without even the necessities of
satisfactory living and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that
made their life significant and certainly with a growing sense of
approaching calamity

The outlaw leader rose surly and crossgrained He had to boot Burt
to drive him out for the horses Riggs followed him Shady Jones did
nothing except grumble Wilson by common consent always made the
sourdough bread and he was slow about it this morning Anson and Moze
did the rest of the work without alacrity The girl did not appear

Is she dead growled Anson

No she aint replied Wilson looking up Shes sleepin Let her
sleep Shed shore be a sight better off if she was daid

Ahuh So would all of this hyar outfit was Ansons response

Wal Snaake I shore reckon well all be thet there soon drawled
Wilson in his familiar cool and irritating tone that said so much more
than the content of the words

Anson did not address the Texas member of his party again

Burt rode bareback into camp driving half the number of the horses
Riggs followed shortly with several more But three were missed one
of them being Ansons favorite He would not have budged without that
horse During breakfast he growled about his lazy men and after the
meal tried to urge them off Riggs went unwillingly Burt refused to go
at all

Nix I footed them hills all Im agoin to he said An from now on
I rustle my own hoss

The leader glared his reception of this opposition Perhaps his sense of
fairness actuated him once more for he ordered Shady and Moze out to do
their share

Jim youre the best tracker in this outfit Suppose you go suggested
Anson You allus used to be the first one off

Times has changed Snake was the imperturbable reply

Wal wont you go demanded the leader impatiently

I shore wont

Wilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the
girl in camp with one or any or all of Ansons gang but the truth was
as significant as if he had shouted it The slowthinking Moze gave
Wilson a sinister look

Boss aint it funny how a pretty wench began Shady Jones
sarcastically

Shut up you fool broke in Anson Come on Ill help rustle them
hosses

After they had gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the
forest Then the girl appeared Her hair was down her face pale with
dark shadows She asked for water to wash her face Wilson pointed to
the brook and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean
scarf from his pack and carried them to her

Upon her return to the campfire she looked very different with her hair
arranged and the red stains in her cheeks

Miss air you hungry asked Wilson

Yes I am she replied

He helped her to portions of bread venison and gravy and a cup of
coffee Evidently she relished the meat but she had to force down the
rest

Where are they all she asked

Rustlin the hosses

Probably she divined that he did not want to talk for the fleeting
glance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had
changed Presently she sought a seat under the aspentree out of
the sun and the smoke continually blowing in her face and there she
stayed a forlorn little figure for all the resolute lips and defiant
eyes

The Texan paced to and fro beside the campfire with bent head
and hands locked behind him But for the swinging gun he would have
resembled a lanky farmer coatless and hatless with his brown vest
open his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots

And neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for
a long time At length however after peering into the woods and
listening he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment
and then walked off around the spruces

No sooner had he disappearedin fact so quickly afterward that it
presupposed design instead of accidentthan Riggs came running from the
opposite side of the glade He ran straight to the girl who sprang to
her feet

I hidtwo of thehorses he panted husky with excitement Ill
taketwo saddles You grab some grub Well run for it

No she cried stepping back

But its not safefor ushere he said hurriedly glancing all
around Ill take youhome I swear Not safeI tell youthis
gangs after me Hurry

He laid hold of two saddles one with each hand The moment had reddened
his face brightened his eyes made his action strong

Im saferhere with this outlaw gang she replied

You wont come His color began to lighten then and his face to
distort He dropped his hold on the saddles

Harve Riggs Id rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than
spend an hour alone with you she flashed at him in unquenchable hate

Ill drag you

He seized her but could not hold her Breaking away she screamed

Help

That whitened his face drove him to frenzy Leaping forward he struck
her a hard blow across the mouth It staggered her and tripping on a
saddle she fell His hands flew to her throat ready to choke her But
she lay still and held her tongue Then he dragged her to her feet

Hurry nowgrab that packan follow me Again Riggs laid hold of the
two saddles A desperate gleam baleful and vainglorious flashed over
his face He was living his one great adventure

The girls eyes dilated They looked beyond him Her lips opened

Scream again an Ill kill you he cried hoarsely and swiftly The
very opening of her lips had terrified Riggs

Reckon one scream was enough spoke a voice slow but without the
drawl easy and cool yet incalculable in some terrible sense

Riggs wheeled with inarticulate cry Wilson stood a few paces off with
his gun half leveled low down His face seemed as usual only his eyes
held a quivering light intensity like boiling molten silver

Girl what made thet blood on your mouth

Riggs hit me she whispered Then at something she feared or saw or
divined she shrank back dropped on her knees and crawled into the
spruce shelter

Wal Riggs Id invite you to draw if thet d be any use said Wilson
This speech was reflective yet it hurried a little

Riggs could not draw nor move nor speak He seemed turned to stone
except his jaw which slowly fell

Harve Riggs gunman from down Missouri way continued the voice of
incalculable intent reckon youve looked into a heap of gunbarrels in
your day Shore Wal look in this heah one

Wilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with Riggss starting
eyes

Wasnt you heard to brag in Turners saloonthet you could see lead
cominan dodge it Shore you must be swift DODGE THIS HEAH
BULLET

The gun spouted flame and boomed One of Riggss starting popping
eyesthe right onewent out like a lamp The other rolled horribly
then set in blank dead fixedness Riggs swayed in slow motion until a
lost balance felled him heavily an inert mass

Wilson bent over the prostrate form Strange violent contrast to the
cool scorn of the preceding moment Hissing spitting as if poisoned by
passion he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to
express on a living counterfeit Wilson was shaken as if by a palsy He
choked over passionate incoherent invective It was class hate first
then the hate of real manhood for a craven then the hate of disgrace
for a murder No man so fair as a gunfighter in the Western creed of an
even break

Wilsons terrible cataclysm of passion passed Straightening up he
sheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire Not many
moments afterward he jerked his head high and listened Horses were
softly thudding through the forest Soon Anson rode into sight with
his men and one of the strayed horses It chanced too that young Burt
appeared on the other side of the glade He walked quickly as one who
anticipated news

Snake Anson as he dismounted espied the dead man

JimI thought I heard a shot

The others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate
form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted
by sight of sudden death

That emotion was only momentary

Shot his lamp out ejaculated Moze

Wonder how Gunman Riggs liked thet plumb center peg exclaimed Shady
Jones with a hard laugh

Back of his head all gone gasped young Burt Not improbably he had
not seen a great many bulletmarked men

Jimthe longhaired fool didnt try to draw on you exclaimed Snake
Anson astounded

Wilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing

What was it over added Anson curiously

He hit the gurl replied Wilson

Then there were longdrawn exclamations all around and glance met
glance

Jim you saved me the job continued the outlaw leader An Im much
obliged Fellars search Riggs an well divvy Thet all right
Jim

Shore an you can have my share

They found banknotes in the mans pocket and considerable gold worn in
a moneybelt around his waist Shady Jones appropriated his boots and
Moze his gun Then they left him as he had fallen

Jim youll have to track them lost hosses Two still missin an one
of thems mine called Anson as Wilson paced to the end of his beat

The girl heard Anson for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and
called Riggs said hed hid two of the horses They must be close He
came that way

Howdy kid Thets good news replied Anson His spirits were rising
He must hev wanted you to slope with him

Yes I wouldnt go

An then he hit you

Yes

Wal recallin your talk of yestiddy I cant see as Mister Riggs
lasted much longer hyar than hed hev lasted in Texas Weve some of
thet great country right in our outfit

The girl withdrew her white face

Its break camp boys was the leaders order A couple of you look
up them hosses Theyll be hid in some thick spruces The rest of us ll
pack


Soon the gang was on the move heading toward the height of land and
swerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not
leave any tracks

They did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon but
they climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau
that stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks Here rose the great
and gloomy forest of firs and pines with the spruce overshadowed and
thinned out The last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome a zigzag
winding breaking climbing hunt for the kind of campsite suited
to Ansons fancy He seemed to be growing strangely irrational about
selecting places to camp At last for no reason that could have been
manifest to a good woodsman he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the
densest forest that had been traversed The opening if such it could
have been called was not a park or even a glade A dark cliff with
strange holes rose to one side but not so high as the lofty pines that
brushed it Along its base babbled a brook running over such formation
of rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different
sounds some singing others melodious and one at least of a hollow
weird deep sound not loud but strangely penetrating

Sure spooky I say observed Shady sentiently

The little uplift of mood coincident with the rifling of Riggss
person had not worn over to this evening camp What talk the outlaws
indulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones The place enjoined
silence

Wilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the
night before Only he advised her not to starve herself she must eat
to keep up her strength She complied at the expense of considerable
effort

As it had been a backbreaking day in which all of them except the
girl had climbed miles on foot they did not linger awake long enough
after supper to learn what a wild weird and pitchblack spot the
outlaw leader had chosen The little spaces of open ground between the
hugetrunked pinetrees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading
foliage Not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that Stygian
pit The wind cutting down over abrupt heights farther up sang in the
pineneedles as if they were strings vibrant with chords Dismal creaks
were audible They were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one
another but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince
any human that they were other than ghostly Then despite the wind and
despite the changing murmur of the brook there seemed to be a silence
insulating them as deep and impenetrable as the darkness

But the outlaws who were fugitives now slept the sleep of the weary
and heard nothing They awoke with the sun when the forest seemed smoky
in a golden gloom when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day

The horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night a
circumstance that Anson was not slow to appreciate

It aint no cheerful camp but I never seen a safer place to hole up
in he remarked to Wilson

Wal yesif any place is safe replied that ally dubiously

We can watch our back tracks There aint any other way to git in hyar
thet I see

Snake we was tolerable fair sheeprustlers but were no good
woodsmen

Anson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his
mainstay Then he sent Burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other
men at cards As they now had the means to gamble they at once became
absorbed Wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the
gamblers and the drooping figure of the girl The morning air was
keen and she evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the
campfire had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell A couple
of hours passed the sun climbed high the air grew warmer Once the
outlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavytimbered slopes that
inclosed the camp

Jim them hosses are strayin off he observed

Wilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small open patches
in the direction of the horses They had grazed around from the right
toward the outlet of the brook Here headed a ravine dense and green
Two of the horses had gone down Wilson evidently heard them though
they were not in sight and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of
them and drive them back The invisible brook ran down over the rocks
with murmur and babble He halted with instinctive action He listened
Forest sounds soft lulling came on the warm pinescented breeze It
would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls
He moved on cautiously and turned into a little open mossy spot
brownmatted and odorous full of ferns and bluebells In the middle
of this deep in the moss he espied a huge round track of a cougar
He bent over it Suddenly he stiffened then straightened guardedly At
that instant he received a hard prod in the back Throwing up his hands
he stood still then slowly turned A tall hunter in gray buckskin
grayeyed and squarejawed had him covered with a cocked rifle And
beside this hunter stood a monster cougar snarling and blinking



CHAPTER XXII

Howdy Dale drawled Wilson Reckon youre a little previous on me

Sssssh Not so loud said the hunter in low voice Youre Jim
Wilson

Shore am Say Dale you showed up soon Or did you jest happen to run
acrost us

Ive trailed you Wilson Im after the girl

I knowed thet when I seen you

The cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master
and he opened his mouth showing great yellow fangs and spat at Wilson
The outlaw apparently had no fear of Dale or the cocked rifle but that
huge snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness

Wilson Ive heard you spoken of as a white outlaw said Dale

Mebbe I am But shore Ill be a scared one in a minit Dale hes goin
to jump me

The cougar wont jump you unless I make him Wilson if I let you go
will you get the girl for me

Wal lemme see Supposin I refuse queried Wilson shrewdly

Then one way or another its all up with you

Reckon I aint got much choice Yes Ill do it But Dale are you
goin to take my word for thet an let me go back to Anson

Yes I am Youre no fool An I believe youre square Ive got Anson
and his gang corralled You cant slip menot in these woods I could
run off your horsespick you off one by oneor turn the cougar loose
on you at night

Shore Its your game Anson dealt himself this hand Between you
an me Dale I never liked the deal

Who shot Riggs I found his body

Wal yours truly was around when thet come off replied Wilson with
an involuntary little shudder Some thought made him sick

The girl Is she safeunharmed queried Dale hurriedly

Shes shore jest as safe an sound as when she was home Dale shes
the gamest kid thet ever breathed Why no one could hev ever made me
believe a girl a kid like her could hev the nerve shes got Nothins
happened to her cept Riggs hit her in the mouth I killed him for
thet An so help me God I believe its been workin in me to save
her somehow Now itll not be so hard

But how demanded Dale

Lemme see Wal Ive got to sneak her out of camp an meet you
Thets all

It must be done quick

But Dale listen remonstrated Wilson earnestly Too quick ll
be as bad as too slow Snake is sore these days gittin sorer all the
time He might savvy somethin if I aint careful an kill the girl
or do her harm I know these fellars Theyre all ready to go to pieces
An shore I must play safe Shore itd be safer to have a plan

Wilsons shrewd light eyes gleamed with an idea He was about to lower
one of his upraised hands evidently to point to the cougar when he
thought better of that

Ansons scared of cougars Mebbe we can scare him an the gang so it
d be easy to sneak the girl off Can you make thet big brute do tricks
Rush the camp at night an squall an chase off the horses

Ill guarantee to scare Anson out of ten years growth replied Dale

Shore its a go then resumed Wilson as if glad Ill post the
girlgive her a hunch to do her part You sneak up tonight jest before
dark Ill hev the gang worked up An then you put the cougar to his
tricks whatever you want When the gang gits wild Ill grab the girl
an pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an whistle fer you
But mebbe thet aint so good If thet cougar comes pilin into camp he
might jump me instead of one of the gang An another hunch He might
slope up on me in the dark when I was tryin to find you Shore thet
aint appealin to me

Wilson this cougar is a pet replied Dale You think hes dangerous
but hes not No more than a kitten He only looks fierce He has never
been hurt by a person an hes never fought anythin himself but deer
an bear I can make him trail any scent But the truth is I couldnt
make him hurt you or anybody All the same he can be made to scare the
hair off any one who doesnt know him

Shore thet settles me Ill be havin a grand joke while them fellars
is scared to death Dale you can depend on me An Im beholdin
to you fer what ll square me some with myself Tonight an if it
wont work then tomorrer night shore

Dale lowered the rifle The big cougar spat again Wilson dropped his
hands and stepping forward split the green wall of intersecting spruce
branches Then he turned up the ravine toward the glen Once there in
sight of his comrades his action and expression changed

Hosses all thar Jim asked Anson as he picked up his cards

Shore They act awful queer them hosses replied Wilson Theyre
afraid of somethin

Ahuh Silvertip mebbe muttered Anson Jim You jest keep watch of
them hosses Wed be done if some tarnal varmint stampeded them

Reckon Im elected to do all the work now complained Wilson while
you cardsharps cheat each other Rustle the hossesan water an
firewood Cook an wash Hey

No one I ever seen can do them camp tricks any better n Jim Wilson
replied Anson

Jim youre a ladys man an thars our pretty hoodoo over thar to
feed an amoose remarked Shady Jones with a smile that disarmed his
speech

The outlaws guffawed

Git out Jim youre breakin up the game said Moze who appeared
loser

Wal thet gurl would starve if it wasnt fer me replied Wilson
genially and he walked over toward her beginning to address her quite
loudly as he approached Wal miss Im elected cook an Id shore
like to heah what you fancy fer dinner

The outlaws heard for they guffawed again Haw Haw if Jim aint
funny exclaimed Anson

The girl looked up amazed Wilson was winking at her and when he got
near he began to speak rapidly and low

I jest met Dale down in the woods with his pet cougar Hes after you
Im goin to help him git you safe away Now you do your part I want
you to pretend youve gone crazy Savvy Act out of your head Shore
I dont care what you do or say only act crazy An dont be scared
Were goin to scare the gang so Ill hev a chance to sneak you away
Tonight or tomorrowshore

Before he began to speak she was pale sad dull of eye Swiftly with
his words she was transformed and when he had ended she did not appear
the same girl She gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and
nodded her head rapidly

Yes I understand Ill do it she whispered

The outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air confounded
amid his shrewd acting and he did not collect himself until halfway
back to his comrades Then beginning to hum an old darky tune he
stirred up and replenished the fire and set about preparation for the
midday meal But he did not miss anything going on around him He saw
the girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over
her face Wilson back to his comrades grinned his glee and he wagged
his head as if he thought the situation was developing

The gambling outlaws however did not at once see the girl preening
herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle

Busted ejaculated Anson with a curse as he slammed down his cards
If I aint hoodooed Im a twobit of a gambler

Sartin youre hoodooed said Shady Jones in scorn Is thet jest
dawnin on you

Boss you play like a cow stuck in the mud remarked Moze
laconically

Fellars it aint funny declared Anson with pathetic gravity Im
jest gittin on to myself Somethins wrong Since way last fall no
lucknothin but the wust end of everythin I aint blamin anybody
Im the boss Its me thets off

Snake shore it was the gurl deal you made rejoined Wilson who had
listened I told you Our troubles hev only begun An I can see the
windup Look

Wilson pointed to where the girl stood her hair flying wildly all over
her face and shoulders She was making most elaborate bows to an old
stump sweeping the ground with her tresses in her obeisance

Anson started He grew utterly astounded His amaze was ludicrous And
the other two men looked to stare to equal their leaders bewilderment

What n hells come over her asked Anson dubiously Must hev perked
up But she aint feelin thet gay

Wilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger

Shore I was scared of her this mawnin he whispered

Naw exclaimed Anson incredulously

If she haint queer I never seen no queer wimmin vouchsafed Shady
Jones and it would have been judged by the way he wagged his head
that he had been all his days familiar with women

Moze looked beyond words and quite alarmed

I seen it comin declared Wilson very much excited But I was
scared to say so Youall made fun of me aboot her Now I shore wish I
had spoken up

Anson nodded solemnly He did not believe the evidence of his sight
but the facts seemed stunning As if the girl were a dangerous and
incomprehensible thing he approached her step by step Wilson followed
and the others appeared drawn irresistibly

Hey tharkid called Anson hoarsely

The girl drew her slight form up haughtily Through her spreading
tresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader But she
deigned not to reply

Hey tharyou Rayner girl added Anson lamely Whats ailin you

My lord did you address me she asked loftily

Shady Jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some
humor from the situation as his dark face began to break its strain

Aww breathed Anson heavily

Ophelia awaits your command my lord Ive been gathering flowers
she said sweetly holding up her empty hands as if they contained a
bouquet

Shady Jones exploded in convulsed laughter But his merriment was not
shared And suddenly it brought disaster upon him The girl flew at him

Why do you croak you toad I will have you whipped and put in irons
you scullion she cried passionately

Shady underwent a remarkable change and stumbled in his backward
retreat Then she snapped her fingers in Mozes face

You black devil Get hence Avaunt

Anson plucked up courage enough to touch her

Aww Now Ophelyar

Probably he meant to try to humor her but she screamed and he jumped
back as if she might burn him She screamed shrilly in wild staccato
notes

You You she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader You brute to
women You ran off from your wife

Anson turned plumcolor and then slowly white The girl must have sent a
random shot home

And now the devils turned you into a snake A long scaly snake with
green eyes Uugh Youll crawl on your belly soonwhen my cowboy finds
you And hell tramp you in the dust

She floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully arms spread
and hair flying and then apparently oblivious of the staring men she
broke into a low sweet song Next she danced around a pine then danced
into her little green inclosure From which presently she sent out the
most doleful moans

Aww What a shame burst out Anson Thet fine healthy nervy kid
Clean gone Daffy Crazy n a bedbug

Shore its a shame protested Wilson But its wuss for us Lord if
we was hoodooed before what will we be now Didnt I tell you Snake
Anson You was warned Ask Shady an Mozethey see whats up

No luck ll ever come our way agin predicted Shady mournfully

It beats me boss it beats me muttered Moze

A crazy woman on my hands If thet aint the last straw broke out
Anson tragically as he turned away Ignorant superstitious worked
upon by things as they seemed the outlaw imagined himself at last beset
by malign forces When he flung himself down upon one of the packs his
big redhaired hands shook Shady and Moze resembled two other men at
the end of their ropes

Wilsons tense face twitched and he averted it as apparently he fought
off a paroxysm of some nature Just then Anson swore a thundering oath

Crazy or not Ill git gold out of thet kid he roared

But man talk sense Are you gittin daffy too I declare this
outfits been eatin loco You cant git gold fer her said Wilson
deliberately

Why cant I

Cause were tracked We cant make no dickers Why in another day or
so well be dodgin lead

Tracked Whar d you git thet idee As soon as this queried Anson
lifting his head like a striking snake His men likewise betrayed
sudden interest

Shore its no idee I aint seen any one But I feel it in my senses
I hear somebody comina step on our trailall the timenight in
particular Reckon theres a big posse after us

Wal if I see or hear anythin Ill knock the girl on the head an
well dig out of hyar replied Anson sullenly

Wilson executed a swift forward motion violent and passionate so
utterly unlike what might have been looked for from him that the three
outlaws gaped

Then youll shore hev to knock Jim Wilson on the haid first he said
in voice as strange as his action

Jim You wouldnt go back on me implored Anson with uplifted hands
in a dignity of pathos

Im losin my haid too an you shore might as well knock it in an
youll hev to before Ill stand you murderin thet pore little gurl
youve drove crazy

Jim I was only mad replied Anson Fer thet matter Im growin
daffy myself Aw we all need a good stiff drink of whisky

So he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension but he failed His
comrades did not rally to his help Wilson walked away nodding his
head

Boss let Jim alone whispered Shady Its orful the way you buck
agin himwhen you seen hes stirred up Jims true blue But you
gotta be careful

Moze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods

When the cardplaying was resumed Anson did not join the game and
both Moze and Shady evinced little of that wholehearted obsession which
usually attended their gambling Anson lay at length his head in a
saddle scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept
herself out of sight At times a faint song or laugh very unnatural
was wafted across the space Wilson plodded at the cooking and
apparently heard no sounds Presently he called the men to eat which
office they surlily and silently performed as if it was a favor
bestowed upon the cook

Snake hadnt I ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl asked
Wilson

Do you hev to ask me thet snapped Anson Shes gotta be fed if we
hev to stuff it down her throat

Wal I aint stuck on the job replied Wilson But Ill tackle it
seein youall got cold feet

With plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little leanto and
kneeling he put his head inside The girl quickeyed and alert had
evidently seen him coming At any rate she greeted him with a cautious
smile

Jim was I pretty good she whispered

Miss you was shore the finest aktress I ever seen he responded in a
low voice But you dam near overdid it Im goin to tell Anson youre
sick nowpoisoned or somethin awful Then well wait till night Dale
shore will help us out

Oh Im on fire to get away she exclaimed Jim Wilson Ill never
forget you as long as I live

He seemed greatly embarrassed

WalmissIIll do my best licks But I aint gamblin none on
results Be patient Keep your nerve Dont get scared I reckon between
me an Dale youll git away from heah

Withdrawing his head he got up and returned to the campfire where
Anson was waiting curiously

I left the grub But she didnt touch it Seems sort of sick to me
like she was poisoned

Jim didnt I hear you talkin asked Anson

Shore I was coaxin her Reckon she aint so ranty as she was But she
shore is doubledup an sickish

Wuss an wuss all the time said Anson between his teeth An
wheres Burt Hyar its noon an he left early He never was no
woodsman Hes got lost

Either thet or hes run into somethin replied Wilson thoughtfully

Anson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breaththe reaction
of a man whose accomplices and partners and tools whose luck whose
faith in himself had failed him He flung himself down under a tree and
after a while when his rigidity relaxed he probably fell asleep Moze
and Shady kept at their game Wilson paced to and fro sat down and
then got up to bunch the horses again walked around the dell and back
to camp The afternoon hours were long And they were waiting hours The
act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did

At sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague thick
twilight Anson rolled over yawned and sat up As he glanced around
evidently seeking Burt his face clouded

No sign of Burt he asked

Wilson expressed a mild surprise Wal Snake you aint expectin Burt
now

I am course I am Why not demanded Anson Any other time wed look
fer him wouldnt we

Any other time aint now Burt wont ever come back Wilson spoke
it with a positive finality

Ahuh Some more of them queer feelins of yournoperatin again hey
Them onnatural kind thet you cant explain hey

Ansons queries were bitter and rancorous

Yes An Snake I tax you with this heah Aint any of them queer
feelins operatin in you

No rolled out the leader savagely But his passionate denial was a
proof that he lied From the moment of this outburst which was a fierce
clinging to the old brave instincts of his character unless a sudden
change marked the nature of his fortunes he would rapidly deteriorate
to the breakingpoint And in such brutal unrestrained natures as his
this breakingpoint meant a desperate stand a desperate forcing of
events a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal
and to meet disaster and blood and death

Wilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit No one
asked him to cook No one made any effort to do so One by one each man
went to the pack to get some bread and meat

Then they waited as men who knew not what they waited for yet hated and
dreaded it

Twilight in that glen was naturally a strange veiled condition of the
atmosphere It was a merging of shade and light which two seemed to
make gray creeping shadows

Suddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men

Somethin scared the hosses said Anson rising Come on

Moze accompanied him and they disappeared in the gloom More trampling
of hoofs was heard then a cracking of brush and the deep voices of
men At length the two outlaws returned leading three of the horses
which they haltered in the open glen

The campfire light showed Ansons face dark and serious

Jim them hosses are wilder n deer he said I ketched mine an
Moze got two But the rest worked away whenever we come close Some
varmint has scared them bad We all gotta rustle out thar quick

Wilson rose shaking his head doubtfully And at that moment the quiet
air split to a piercing horrid neigh of a terrified horse Prolonged to
a screech it broke and ended Then followed snorts of fright pound and
crack and thud of hoofs and crash of brush then a gathering thumping
crashing roar split by piercing sounds

Stampede yelled Anson and he ran to hold his own horse which he had
haltered right in camp It was big and wildlooking and now reared and
plunged to break away Anson just got there in time and then it took
all his weight to pull the horse down Not until the crashing snorting
pounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did
Anson dare leave his frightened favorite

Gone Our horses are gone Did you hear em he exclaimed blankly

Shore Theyre a cutup an crippled bunch by now replied Wilson

Boss well never git ern back not n a hundred years declared
Moze

Thet settles us Snake Anson stridently added Shady Jones Them
hosses are gone You can kiss your hand to them They wasnt hobbled
They hed an orful scare They split on thet stampede an theyll never
git together  See what youve fetched us to

Under the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to
his seat staggered and silenced In fact silence fell upon all the men
and likewise enfolded the glen

Night set in jetblack dismal lonely without a star Faintly the wind
moaned Weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in
the sound that was hollow It was never the samea rumble as if faint
distant thundera deep gurgle as of water drawn into a vortexa
rolling as of a stone in swift current The black cliff was invisible
yet seemed to have many weird faces the giant pines loomed spectral
the shadows were thick moving changing Flickering lights from the
campfire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the
brooding men This campfire did not burn or blaze cheerily it had no
glow no sputter no white heart no red living embers One by one the
outlaws as if with common consent tried their hands at making the fire
burn aright What little wood had been collected was old it would burn
up with false flare only to die quickly

After a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred Not one smoked
Their gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire Each one was concerned with
his own thoughts his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of
the future That brooding hour severed him from comrade

At night nothing seemed the same as it was by day With success and
plenty with fullblooded action past and more in store these outlaws
were as different from their present state as this black night was
different from the bright day they waited for Wilson though he played
a deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girland thus did
not have haunting and superstitious fears on her accountwas probably
more conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them

The evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature out of the
darkness and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears
Fear was their predominating sense For years they had lived with some
species of fearof honest men or vengeance of pursuit of starvation
of lack of drink or gold of blood and death of stronger men of luck
of chance of fate of mysterious nameless force Wilson was the type of
fearless spirit but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of
allthat of himselfthat he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his
manhood

So they hunched around the campfire brooding because hope was at
lowest ebb listening because the weird black silence with its moan
of wind and hollow laugh of brook compelled them to hear waiting for
sleep for the hours to pass for whatever was to come

And it was Anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom



CHAPTER XXIII

Listen

Anson whispered tensely His poise was motionless his eyes roved
everywhere He held up a shaking bludgy finger to command silence

A third and stranger sound accompanied the low weird moan of the wind
and the hollow mockery of the brookand it seemed a barely perceptible
exquisitely delicate wail or whine It filled in the lulls between the
other sounds

If thets some varmint hes close whispered Anson

But shore its far off said Wilson

Shady Jones and Moze divided their opinions in the same way

All breathed freer when the wail ceased relaxing to their former
lounging positions around the fire An impenetrable wall of blackness
circled the pale space lighted by the campfire and this circle
contained the dark somber group of men in the center the dying
campfire and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on
the outer edge The horses scarcely moved from their tracks and their
erect alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities
of the night

Then at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a
wailing whine

Its thet crazy wench cryin declared the outlaw leader

Apparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as
they had expressed for the termination of the sound

Shore thet must be it agreed Jim Wilson gravely

Well git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin all night growled
Shady Jones

She gives me the creeps said Moze

Wilson got up to resume his pondering walk head bent hands behind his
back a grim realistic figure of perturbation

Jimset down You make me nervous said Anson irritably

Wilson actually laughed but low as if to keep his strange mirth well
confined

Snake Ill bet you my hoss an my gun agin a biscuit thet in aboot
six seconds more or less Ill be stampedin like them hosses

Ansons lean jaw dropped The other two outlaws stared with round
eyes Wilson was not drunk they evidently knew but what he really was
appeared a mystery

Jim Wilson are you showin yellow queried Anson hoarsely

Mebbe The Lord only knows But listen heah Snake youve seen an
heard people croak

You mean cash indie

Shore

Wal yesa couple or so replied Anson grimly

But you never seen no one die of shockof an orful scare

No I reckon I never did

I have An thets whats ailin Jim Wilson and he resumed his dogged
steps

Anson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one
another

Ahuh Say whats thet got to do with us hyar asked Anson presently

Thet gurl is dyin retorted Wilson in a voice cracking like a whip

The three outlaws stiffened in their seats incredulous yet
irresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark lonely
illomened hour

Wilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle muttering to himself
and came back again then he trudged farther this time almost out
of sight but only to return the third time he vanished in the
impenetrable wall of light The three men scarcely moved a muscle as
they watched the place where he had disappeared In a few moments he
came stumbling back

Shore shes almost gone he said dismally It took my nerve but
I felt of her face Thet orful wail is her breath chokin in her
throat Like a deathrattle only long instead of short

Wal if shes gotta croak its good she gits it over quick replied
Anson I aint hed sleep fer three nights  An what I need is
whisky

Snake thets gospel youre spoutin remarked Shady Jones morosely

The direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of but
any man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that
the difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by
different distances and positions Also when it was loudest it was
most like a whine But these outlaws heard with their consciences

At last it ceased abruptly

Wilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night His absence
was longer than usual but he returned hurriedly

Shes daid he exclaimed solemnly Thet innocent kidwho never
harmed no onean whod make any man better fer seein hershes
daid Anson youve shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes

Whats eatin you demanded the leader angrily Her blood aint on
my hands

It shore is shouted Wilson shaking his hand at Anson An youll
hev to take your medicine I felt thet comin all along An I feel some
more

Aw Shes jest gone to sleep declared Anson shaking his long frame
as he rose Gimme a light

Boss youre plumb off to go near a dead gurl thets jest died crazy
protested Shady Jones

Off Haw Haw Who aint off in this outfit Id like to know Anson
possessed himself of a stick blazing at one and and with this he
stalked off toward the leanto where the girl was supposed to be dead
His gaunt figure lighted by the torch certainly fitted the weird
black surroundings And it was seen that once near the girls shelter he
proceeded more slowly until he halted He bent to peer inside

SHES GONE he yelled in harsh shaken accents

Than the torch burned out leaving only a red glow He whirled it about
but the blaze did not rekindle His comrades peering intently lost
sight of his tall form and the end of the redended stick Darkness like
pitch swallowed him For a moment no sound intervened Again the moan of
wind the strange little mocking hollow roar dominated the place Then
there came a rush of something perhaps of air like the soft swishing
of spruce branches swinging aside Dull thudding footsteps followed it
Anson came running back to the fire His aspect was wild his face pale
his eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets He had drawn his
gun

Didyesee er hearanythin he panted peering back then all
around and at last at his man

No An I shore was lookin an listenin replied Wilson

Boss there wasnt nothin declared Moze

I aint so sartin said Shady Jones with doubtful staring eyes I
believe I heerd a rustlin

She wasnt there ejaculated Anson in wondering awe Shes gone
My torch went out I couldnt see An jest then I felt somethin was
passin Fast I jerked round All was black an yet if I didnt see
a big gray streak Im crazier n thet gurl But I couldnt swear to
anythin but a rushin of wind I felt thet

Gone exclaimed Wilson in great alarm Fellars if thets so then
mebbe she wasnt daid an she wandered off  But she was daid Her
heart hed quit beatin Ill swear to thet

I move to break camp said Shady Jones gruffly and he stood up Moze
seconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage

Jim if shes deadan gonewhat n hells come off huskily asked
Anson It only seems thet way Were all worked up Lets talk
sense

Anson shore theres a heap you an me dont know replied Wilson
The world come to an end once Wal it can come to another end I
tell you I aint surprised

THAR cried Anson whirling with his gun leaping out

Something huge shadowy gray against the black rushed behind the men
and trees and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air

Shore Snake there wasnt nothin said Wilson presently

I heerd whispered Shady Jones

It was only a breeze blowin thet smoke rejoined Moze

Id bet my soul somethin went back of me declared Anson glaring
into the void

Listen an lets make shore suggested Wilson

The guilty agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the
flickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow Like
statues they stood watching and listening

Few sounds stirred in the strange silence Now and then the horses
heaved heavily but stood still a dismal dreary note of the wind in
the pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook And these low sounds
only fastened attention upon the quality of the silence A breathing
lonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell Like a pit of
unplumbed depths the dark night yawned An evil conscience listening
there could have heard the most peaceful beautiful and mournful
sounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell

Suddenly the silent oppressive surcharged air split to a short
piercing scream

Ansons big horse stood up straight pawing the air and came down with
a crash The other horses shook with terror

Wasnttheta cougar whispered Anson thickly

Thet was a womans scream replied Wilson and he appeared to be
shaking like a leaf in the wind

ThenI figgered rightthe kids alivewonderin aroundan she let
out thet orful scream said Anson

Wonderin round yesbut shes daid

My Gawd it aint possible

Wal if she aint wonderin round daid shes almost daid replied
Wilson And he began to whisper to himself

If Id only knowed what thet deal meant Id hev plugged Beasley instead
of listenin An I ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an
made sartin shed croaked If she goes screamin round thet way

His voice failed as there rose a thin splitting highpointed shriek
somewhat resembling the first scream only less wild It came apparently
from the cliff

From another point in the pitchblack glen rose the wailing terrible
cry of a woman in agony Wild haunting mournful wail

Ansons horse loosing the halter plunged back almost falling over a
slight depression in the rocky ground The outlaw caught him and dragged
him nearer the fire The other horses stood shaking and straining Moze
ran between them and held them Shady Jones threw green brush on the
fire With sputter and crackle a blaze started showing Wilson standing
tragically his arms out facing the black shadows

The strange live shriek was not repeated But the cry like that of
a woman in her deaththroes pierced the silence again It left a
quivering ring that softly died away Then the stillness clamped down
once more and the darkness seemed to thicken The men waited and when
they had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close right
behind the trees It was humanthe personification of pain and
terrorthe tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death
So pure so exquisite so wonderful was the cry that the listeners
writhed as if they saw an innocent tender beautiful girl torn
frightfully before their eyes It was full of suspense it thrilled
for death its marvelous potency was the wild notethat beautiful and
ghastly note of selfpreservation

In sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall
whence the cry came Then he had to fight his horse to keep him from
plunging away Following the shot was an interval of silence the horses
became tractable the men gathered closer to the fire with the halters
still held firmly

If it was a cougarthet d scare him off said Anson

Shore but it aint a cougar replied Wilson Wait an see

They all waited listening with ears turned to different points eyes
roving everywhere afraid of their very shadows Once more the moan of
wind the mockery of brook deep gurgle laugh and babble dominated the
silence of the glen

Boss lets shake this spooky hole whispered Moze

The suggestion attracted Anson and he pondered it while slowly shaking
his head

Weve only three hosses An mine ll take ridinafter them squalls
replied the leader Weve got packs too An hell aint nothin on
this place fer bein dark

No matter Lets go Ill walk an lead the way said Moze eagerly
I got sharp eyes You fellars can ride an carry a pack Well git out
of here an come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit

Anson Im keen fer thet myself declared Shady Jones

Jim what dye say to thet queried Anson Rustlin out of this black
hole

Shore its a grand idee agreed Wilson

Thet was a cougar avowed Anson gathering courage as the silence
remained unbroken But jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed
been a woman screamin over a blade twistin in her gizzards

Snake shore you seen a woman heah lately deliberately asked Wilson

Reckon I did Thet kid replied Anson dubiously

Wal you seen her go crazy didnt you

Yes

An she wasnt heah when you went huntin fer her

Correct

Wal if thets so what do you want to blab about cougars for

Wilsons argument seemed incontestable Shady and Moze nodded gloomily
and shifted restlessly from foot to foot Anson dropped his head

No matterif we only dont hear he began suddenly to grow mute

Right upon them from some place just out the circle of light rose a
scream by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet
heard simply petrifying the group until the peal passed Ansons huge
horse reared and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap
straight out He struck Anson with thudding impact knocking him over
the rocks into the depression back of the campfire and plunging after
him Wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck
and he turned to see Anson go down There came a crash a groan and
then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up Apparently
he had rolled over his master

Help fellars yelled Wilson quick to leap down over the little bank
and in the dim light to grasp the halter The three men dragged the
horse out and securely tied him close to a tree That done they
peered down into the depression Ansons form could just barely be
distinguished in the gloom He lay stretched out Another groan escaped
him

Shore Im scared hes hurt said Wilson

Hoss rolled right on top of him An thet hosss heavy declared Moze

They got down and knelt beside their leader In the darkness his face
looked dull gray His breathing was not right

Snake old man you ainthurt asked Wilson with a tremor in his
voice Receiving no reply he said to his comrades Lay hold an well
heft him up where we can see

The three men carefully lifted Anson up on the bank and laid him near
the fire in the light Anson was conscious His face was ghastly Blood
showed on his lips

Wilson knelt beside him The other outlaws stood up and with one dark
gaze at one another damned Ansons chance of life And on the instant
rose that terrible distressing scream of acute agonylike that of a
woman being dismembered Shady Jones whispered something to Moze Then
they stood up gazing down at their fallen leader

Tell me where youre hurt asked Wilson

Hesmashedmy chest said Anson in a broken strangled whisper

Wilsons deft hands opened the outlaws shirt and felt of his chest

No Shore your breastbone aint smashed replied Wilson hopefully
And he began to run his hand around one side of Ansons body and then
the other Abruptly he stopped averted his gaze then slowly ran the
hand all along that side Ansons ribs had been broken and crushed in
by the weight of the horse He was bleeding at the mouth and his slow
painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth which showed that
the broken bones had penetrated the lungs An injury sooner or later
fatal

Pard you busted a rib or two said Wilson

Aw Jimit must bewuss n thet he whispered Imin orfulpain
An I cantgit anybreath

Mebbe youll be better said Wilson with a cheerfulness his face
belied

Moze bent close over Anson took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face
at the bloodstained lips and the lean hands plucking at nothing Then
he jerked erect

Shady hes goin to cash Lets clear out of this

Im yours pertickler previous replied Jones

Both turned away They untied the two horses and led them up to where
the saddles lay Swiftly the blankets went on swiftly the saddles
swung up swiftly the cinches snapped Anson lay gazing up at Wilson
comprehending this move And Wilson stood strangely grim and silent
somehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours

Shady you grab some bread an Ill pack a bunk of meat said Moze
Both men came near the fire into the light within ten feet of where
the leader lay

Fellarsyou aintslopin he whispered in husky amaze

Boss we air thet same We cant do you no good an this hole aint
healthy replied Moze

Shady Jones swung himself astride his horse all about him sharp eager
strung

Moze Ill tote the grub an you lead out of hyar till we git past the
wust timber he said

Aw Mozeyou wouldnt leaveJim hyaralone implored Anson

Jim can stay till he rots retorted Moze Ive hed enough of this
hole

But Mozeit aint square panted Anson Jim wouldntleave me
Id stickby you Ill make itall up to you

Snake youre goin to cash sardonically returned Moze

A current leaped all through Ansons stretched frame His ghastly face
blazed That was the great and the terrible moment which for long had
been in abeyance Wilson had known grimly that it would come by one
means or another Anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against
the tide of fatal issues Moze and Shady Jones deep locked in their
selfcentered motives had not realized the inevitable trend of their
dark lives

Anson prostrate as he was swiftly drew his gun and shot Moze Without
sound or movement of hand Moze fell Then the plunge of Shadys horse
caused Ansons second shot to miss A quick third shot brought no
apparent result but Shadys cursing resort to his own weapon He tried
to aim from his plunging horse His bullets spattered dust and gravel
over Anson Then Wilsons long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged
Shady collapsed in the saddle and the frightened horse throwing him
plunged out of the circle of light Thudding hoofs crashings of brush
quickly ceased

Jimdid yougit him whispered Anson

Shore did Snake was the slow halting response Jim Wilson must have
sustained a sick shudder as he replied Sheathing his gun he folded a
blanket and put it under Ansons head

Jimmy feetair orful cold whispered Anson

Wal its gittin chilly replied Wilson and taking a second
blanket he laid that over Ansons limbs Snake Im feared Shady hit
you once

Ahuh But not so Id caremuchif I hedno wuss hurt

You lay still now Reckon Shadys hoss stopped out heah a ways An
Ill see

JimI aint heerdthet scream fera little

Shore its gone Reckon now thet was a cougar

I knowed it

Wilson stalked away into the darkness That inky wall did not seem so
impenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light
He proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps He groped from
tree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge
flat rock as high as his head Here the darkness was blackest yet he
was able to see a light form on the rock

Miss are you thereall right he called softly

Yes but Im scared to death she whispered in reply

Shore it wound up sudden Come now I reckon your troubles over

He helped her off the rock and finding her unsteady on her feet he
supported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to
feel for objects Foot by foot they worked out from under the dense
shadow of the cliff following the course of the little brook It
babbled and gurgled and almost drowned the low whistle Wilson sent out
The girl dragged heavily upon him now evidently weakening At length he
reached the little open patch at the head of the ravine Halting here
he whistled An answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right
Wilson waited with the girl hanging on his arm

Dales heah he said An dont you keel over nowafter all the
nerve you hed

A swishing of brush a step a soft padded footfall a looming dark
figure and a long low gray shape stealthily movingit was the last
of these that made Wilson jump

Wilson came Dales subdued voice

Heah Ive got her Dale Safe an sound replied Wilson stepping
toward the tall form And he put the drooping girl into Dales arms

Bo Bo Youre all right Dales deep voice was tremulous

She roused up to seize him and to utter little cries of joy

Oh Dale Oh thank Heaven Im ready to drop now Hasnt it been
a nightan adventure Im wellsafesound Dale we owe it to
this Jim Wilson

Bo Iwell all thank himall our lives replied Dale Wilson

Tolerable

Oh Dale it was terrible I saw it all I

Wal Miss you can tell him after I go Im wishin you good luck

His voice was a cool easy drawl slightly tremulous

The girls face flashed white in the gloom She pressed against the
outlawwrung his hands

Heaven help you Jim Wilson You ARE from Texas Ill remember
youpray for you all my life

Wilson moved away out toward the pale glow of light under the black
pines



CHAPTER XXIV

As Helen Rayner watched Dale ride away on a quest perilous to him and
which meant almost life or death for her it was surpassing strange that
she could think of nothing except the thrilling tumultuous moment when
she had put her arms round his neck

It did not matter that Dalesplendid fellow that he washad made
the ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken
itthe fact that she had actually done it was enough How utterly
impossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them
once they were acted upon Confounding realization then was that when
Dale returned with her sister Helen knew she would do the same thing
over again

If I doI wont be twofaced about it she soliloquized and a hot
blush flamed her cheeks

She watched Dale until he rode out of sight

When he had gone worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion
She turned to the business of meeting events Before supper she packed
her valuables and books papers and clothes together with Bos and
had them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she
would have her personal possessions

The Mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their
tarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranchhouse that night so that Helen
at least would not be surprised But the day came with its manifold
duties undisturbed by any event And it passed slowly with the leaden
feet of listening watching vigilance

Carmichael did not come back nor was there news of him to be had The
last known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day when
a sheepherder had seen him far out on the north range headed for the
hills The Beemans reported that Roys condition had improved and also
that there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village

This second lonely night was almost unendurable for Helen When she
slept it was to dream horrible dreams when she lay awake it was to have
her heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window and
to be in torture of imagination as to poor Bos plight A thousand times
Helen said to herself that Beasley could have had the ranch and welcome
if only Bo had been spared Helen absolutely connected her enemy with
her sisters disappearance Riggs might have been a means to it

Daylight was not attended by so many fears there were things to do
that demanded attention And thus it was that the next morning shortly
before noon she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at
the corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near From the window
she saw a big smoke

Fire That must be one of the barnsthe old one farthest out
she said gazing out of the window Some careless Mexican with his
everlasting cigarette

Helen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened She had
decided to stay in the house But when footsteps sounded on the porch
and a rap on the door she unhesitatingly opened it Four Mexicans stood
close One of them quick as thought flashed a hand in to grasp her
and in a single motion pulled her across the threshold

No hurt Senora he said and pointedmaking motions she must go

Helen did not need to be told what this visit meant Many as her
conjectures had been however she had not thought of Beasley subjecting
her to this outrage And her blood boiled

How dare you she said trembling in her effort to control her temper
But class authority voice availed nothing with these swarthy Mexicans
They grinned Another laid hold of Helen with dirty brown hand She
shrank from the contact

Let go she burst out furiously And instinctively she began to
struggle to free herself Then they all took hold of her Helens
dignity might never have been A burning choking rush of blood was
her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her
inheritance from the Auchinclosses She who had resolved never to lay
herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress The Mexicans
jabbering in their excitement had all they could do until they
lifted her bodily from the porch They handled her as if she had been a
halfempty sack of corn One holding each hand and foot they packed her
with dress disarranged and half torn off down the path to the lane and
down the lane to the road There they stood upright and pushed her off
her property

Through halfblind eyes Helen saw them guarding the gateway ready to
prevent her entrance She staggered down the road to the village
It seemed she made her way through a red dimnessthat there was a
congestion in her brainthat the distance to Mrs Casss cottage was
insurmountable But she got there to stagger up the path to hear the
old womans cry Dizzy faint sick with a blackness enveloping all she
looked at Helen felt herself led into the sittingroom and placed in
the big chair

Presently sight and clearness of mind returned to her She saw Roy
white as a sheet questioning her with terrible eyes The old woman
hung murmuring over her trying to comfort her as well as fasten the
disordered dress

Four greaserspacked me downthe hillthrew me off my ranchinto
the road panted Helen

She seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the
mighty wave of danger that shook her whole body

If Id knownI would have killed them

She exclaimed that fullvoiced and hard with dry hot eyes on her
friends Roy reached out to take her hand speaking huskily Helen
did not distinguish what he said The frightened old woman knelt with
unsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in Helens dress The moment
came when Helens quivering began to subside when her blood quieted
to let her reason sway when she began to do battle with her rage and
slowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a
sleeping tigress in her veins

Oh Miss Helen you looked so turrible I made sure you was hurted
the old woman was saying

Helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists at the one stocking that
hung down over her shoetop at the rent which had bared her shoulder to
the profane gaze of those grinning beadyeyed Mexicans

My bodysnot hurt she whispered

Roy had lost some of his whiteness and where his eyes had been fierce
they were now kind

Wal Miss Nell its lucky no harms done Now if youll only see
this whole deal clear Not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin an
hopin If you can only see whats raw in this Westan love it jest
the same

Helen only half divined his meaning but that was enough for a future
reflection The West was beautiful but hard In the faces of these
friends she began to see the meaning of the keen sloping lines and
shadows of pain of a lean naked truth cut as from marble

For the lands sakes tell us all about it importuned Mrs Cass

Whereupon Helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her
expulsion from her home

Shore weall expected thet said Roy An its jest as well youre
here with a whole skin Beasleys in possession now an I reckon wed
all sooner hev you away from thet ranch

But Roy I wont let Beasley stay there cried Helen

Miss Nell shore by the time this here Pine has growed big enough fer
law youll hev gray in thet pretty hair You cant put Beasley off with
your honest an rightful claim Al Auchincloss was a hard driver He
made enemies an he made some he didnt kill The evil men do lives
after them An youve got to suffer fer Als sins though Al was as
good as any man who ever prospered in these parts

Oh what can I do I wont give up Ive been robbed Cant the people
help me Must I meekly sit with my hands crossed while that halfbreed
thiefOh its unbelievable

I reckon youll jest hev to be patient fer a few days said Roy
calmly Itll all come right in the end

Roy Youve had this deal as you call it all worked out in mind for a
long time exclaimed Helen

Shore an I aint missed a reckonin yet

Then what will happenin a few days

Nell Rayner are you goin to hev some spunk an not lose your nerve
again or go wild out of your head

Ill try to be brave butbut I must be prepared she replied
tremulously

Wal theres Dale an Las Vegas an me fer Beasley to reckon with
An Miss Nell his chances fer long life are as pore as his chances fer
heaven

But Roy I dont believe in deliberate taking of life replied
Helen shuddering Thats against my religion I wont allow it
Andthenthink Dale all of youin danger

Girl how re you ever goin to help yourself Shore you might hold
Dale back if you love him an swear you wont give yourself to him
An I reckon Id respect your religion if you was goin to suffer
through me But not Dale nor younor Bonor love or heaven or hell
can ever stop thet cowboy Las Vegas

Oh if Dale brings Bo back to mewhat will I care for my ranch
murmured Helen

Reckon youll only begin to care when thet happens Your big hunter has
got to be put to work replied Roy with his keen smile


Before noon that day the baggage Helen had packed at home was left on
the porch of Widow Casss cottage and Helens anxious need of the hour
was satisfied She was made comfortable in the old womans one spare
room and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance

To her surprise many of Mrs Casss neighbors came unobtrusively to
the back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries They
appeared a subdued and apprehensive group and whispered to one another
as they left Helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the
wives of the men dominated by Beasley believed no good could come of
this highhanded taking over of the ranch Indeed Helen found at the
end of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune

The next day Roy informed her that his brother John had come down the
preceding night with the news of Beasleys descent upon the ranch Not a
shot had been fired and the only damage done was that of the burning of
a hayfilled barn This had been set on fire to attract Helens men to
one spot where Beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their
number He had boldly ordered them off the land unless they wanted to
acknowledge him boss and remain there in his service The three Beemans
had stayed having planned that just in this event they might be
valuable to Helens interests Beasley had ridden down into Pine the
same as upon any other day Roy reported also news which had come in
that morning how Beasleys crowd had celebrated late the night before

The second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away and Helen
believed they had made her old At night she lay awake most of the time
thinking and praying but during the afternoon she got some sleep She
could think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister and Dales
chances of saving her

Well shore you pay Dale a pore compliment finally protested the
patient Roy I tell youMilt Dale can do anythin he wants to do in
the woods You can believe thet  But I reckon hell run chances
after he comes back

This significant speech thrilled Helen with its assurance of hope and
made her blood curdle at the implied peril awaiting the hunter

On the afternoon of the fifth day Helen was abruptly awakened from her
nap The sun had almost set She heard voicesthe shrill cackling
notes of old Mrs Cass high in excitement a deep voice that made Helen
tingle all over a girls laugh broken but happy There were footsteps
and stamping of hoofs Dale had brought Bo back Helen knew it She grew
very weak and had to force herself to stand erect Her heart began to
pound in her very ears A sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her
soul She thanked God her prayers had been answered Then suddenly alive
with sheer mad physical gladness she rushed out

She was just in time to see Roy Beeman stalk out as if he had never been
shot and with a yell greet a big grayclad grayfaced manDale

Howdy Roy Glad to see you up said Dale How the quiet voice
steadied Helen She beheld Bo Bo looking the same except a little
pale and disheveled Then Bo saw her and leaped at her into her arms

Nell Im here Safeall right Never was so happy in my life
Ohh talk about your adventures Nell you dear old mother to meIve
had eenough forever

Bo was wild with joy and by turns she laughed and cried But Helen
could not voice her feelings Her eyes were so dim that she could
scarcely see Dale when he loomed over her as she held Bo But he found
the hand she put shakily out

Nell Reckon its been harderon you His voice was earnest and
halting She felt his searching gaze upon her face Mrs Cass said you
were here An I know why

Roy led them all indoors

Milt one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss he said
as Dale turned toward the dusty and weary Ranger Whered you leave the
cougar

I sent him home replied Date

Laws now Milt if this aint grand cackled Mrs Cass Weve worried
some here An Miss Helen near starved ahopin fer you

Mother I reckon the girl an I are nearer starved than anybody you
know replied Dale with a grim laugh

Fer the lands sake Ill be fixin supper this minit

Nell why are you here asked Bo suspiciously

For answer Helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door
Bo saw the baggage Her expression changed The old blaze leaped to the
telltale eyes

Hes done it she cried hotly

Dearestthank God Ive got youback again murmured Helen finding
her voice Nothing else matters Ive prayed only for that

Good old Nell whispered Bo and she kissed and embraced Helen You
really mean that I know But nix for yours truly Im back alive and
kicking you bet Wheres mywheres Tom

Bo not a word has been heard of him for five days Hes searching for
you of course

And youve beenbeen put off the ranch

Well rather replied Helen and in a few trembling words she told the
story of her eviction

Bo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance but it became
her passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister

Oh Does Tom Carmichael know this she added breathlessly

How could he

When he finds out thenOh wont there be hell Im glad I got here
first Nell my boots havent been off the whole blessed time Help
me And oh for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes Nell
old girl I wasnt raised right for these Western deals Too luxurious

And then Helen had her ears filled with a rapidfire account of running
horses and Riggs and outlaws and Beasley called boldly to his teeth and
a long ride and an outlaw who was a heroa fight with Riggsblood and
deathanother long ridea wild camp in black woodsnightlonely
ghostly soundsand day againplota great actress lost to the
worldOpheliaSnakes and Ansonshoodooed outlawsmournful moans
and terrible criescougarstampedefight and shots more blood and
deathWilson heroanother Tom Carmichaelfallen in love with outlaw
gunfighter ifblack night and Dale and horse and rides and starved
and Oh Nell he WAS from Texas

Helen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over
the bright head of this beloved little sister but the bewilderment
occasioned by Bos fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last
sentence clear

Presently Helen got a word in to inform Bo that Mrs Cass had knocked
twice for supper and that welcome news checked Bos flow of speech when
nothing else seemed adequate

It was obvious to Helen that Roy and Dale had exchanged stories Roy
celebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he
had been shot and despite Helens misfortune and the suspended waiting
balance in the air the occasion was joyous Old Mrs Cass was in the
height of her glory She sensed a romance here and true to her sex
she radiated to it

Daylight was still lingering when Roy got up and went out on the porch
His keen ears had heard something Helen fancied she herself had heard
rapid hoofbeats

Dale come out called Roy sharply

The hunter moved with his swift noiseless agility Helen and Bo
followed halting in the door

Thets Las Vegas whispered Dale

To Helen it seemed that the cowboys name changed the very atmosphere

Voices were heard at the gate one that harsh and quick sounded like
Carmichaels And a spirited horse was pounding and scattering
gravel Then a lithe figure appeared striding up the path It was
Carmichaelyet not the Carmichael Helen knew She heard Bos strange
little cry a corroboration of her own impression

Roy might never have been shot judging from the way he stepped out
and Dale was almost as quick Carmichael reached themgrasped them with
swift hard hands

BoysI jest rode in An they said youd found her

Shore Las Vegas Dale fetched her home safe an sound There she
is

The cowboy thrust aside the two men and with a long stride he faced the
porch his piercing eyes on the door All that Helen could think of his
look was that it seemed terrible Bo stepped outside in front of Helen
Probably she would have run straight into Carmichaels arms if some
strange instinct had not withheld her Helen judged it to be fear she
found her heart lifting painfully

Bo he yelled like a savage yet he did not in the least resemble
one

OhTom cried Bo falteringly She half held out her arms

You girl That seemed to be his piercing query like the quivering
blade in his eyes Two more long strides carried him close up to her
and his look chased the red out of Bos cheek Then it was beautiful to
see his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered
Las Vegas magnified in all his old spirit

Aw The exclamation was a tremendous sigh I shore am glad

That beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men He wrung
Dales hand long and hard and his gaze confused the older man

RIGGS he said and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the
word disappeared the strange fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion

Wilson killed him replied Dale

Jim Wilsonthat old Texas Ranger Reckon he lent you a hand

My friend he saved Bo replied Dale with emotion My old cougar an
mewe just hung round

You made Wilson help you cut in the hard voice

Yes But he killed Riggs before I come up an I reckon hed done well
by Bo if Id never got there

How about the gang

All snuffed out I reckon except Wilson

Somebody told me Beasley hed ran Miss Helen off the ranch Thet so

Yes Four of his greasers packed her down the hillmost tore her
clothes off so Roy tells me

Four greasers Shore it was Beasleys deal clean through

Yes Riggs was led He had an itch for a bad name you know But
Beasley made the plan It was Nell they wanted instead of Bo

Abruptly Carmichael stalked off down the darkening path his silver
heelplates ringing his spurs jingling

Hold on Carmichael called Dale taking a step

Oh Tom cried Bo

Shore folks callin wont be no use if anythin would be said Roy
Las Vegas has hed a look at red liquor

Hes been drinking Oh that accounts he nevernever even touched
me

For once Helen was not ready to comfort Bo A mighty tug at her heart
had sent her with flying uneven steps toward Dale He took another
stride down the path and another

Daleohplease stop she called very low

He halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path When he
turned Helen had come close Twilight was deep there in the shade of the
peachtrees but she could see his face the hungry flaring eyes

II havent thanked youyetfor bringing Bo home she whispered

Nell never mind that he said in surprise If you mustwhy wait
Ive got to catch up with that cowboy

No Let me thank you now she whispered and stepping closer she put
her arms up meaning to put them round his neck That action must be her
selfpunishment for the other time she had done it Yet it might also
serve to thank him But strangely her hands got no farther than his
breast and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin
jacket She felt a heave of his deep chest

II do thank youwith all my heart she said softly I owe you
nowfor myself and hermore than I can ever repay

Nell Im your friend he replied hurriedly Dont talk of repayin
me Let me go nowafter Las Vegas

What for she queried suddenly

I mean to line up beside himat the baror wherever he goes
returned Dale

Dont tell me that _I_ know Youre going straight to meet Beasley

Nell if you hold me up any longer I reckon Ill have to runor never
get to Beasley before that cowboy

Helen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacketleaned closer to
him all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her

Ill not let you go she said

He laughed and put his great hands over hers What re you sayin
girl You cant stop me

Yes I can Dale I dont want you to risk your life

He stared at her and made as if to tear her hands from their hold

Listenpleaseohplease she implored If you go deliberately
to kill Beasleyand do itthat will be murder Its against my
religion I would be unhappy all my life

But child youll be ruined all your life if Beasley is not dealt
withas men of his breed are always dealt with in the West he
remonstrated and in one quick move he had freed himself from her
clutching fingers

Helen with a move as swift put her arms round his neck and clasped her
hands tight

Milt Im finding myself she said The other day when I
didthisyou made an excuse for me Im not twofaced now

She meant to keep him from killing Beasley if she sacrificed every last
shred of her pride And she stamped the look of his face on her heart
of hearts to treasure always The thrill the beat of her pulses almost
obstructed her thought of purpose

Nell just nowwhen youre overcomerash with feelinsdont say to
mea worda

He broke down huskily

My first friendmyOh Dale I KNOW you love me she whispered And
she hid her face on his breast there to feel a tremendous tumult

Oh dont you she cried in low smothered voice as his silence
drove her farther on this mad yet glorious purpose

If you need to be toldyesI reckon I do love you Nell Rayner he
replied

It seemed to Helen that he spoke from far off She lifted her face her
heart on her lips

If you kill Beasley Ill never marry you she said

Whos expectin you to he asked with low hoarse laugh Do you
think you have to marry me to square accounts Thiss the only time you
ever hurt me Nell Rayner Im shamed you could think Id expect
youout of gratitude

Ohyouyou are as dense as the forest where you live she cried
And then she shut her eyes again the better to remember that
transfiguration of his face the better to betray herself

ManI love you Full and deep yet tremulous the words burst from
her heart that had been burdened with them for many a day

Then it seemed in the throbbing riot of her senses that she was
lifted and swung into his arms and handled with a great and terrible
tenderness and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a
bear and held with her feet off the ground and rendered blind dizzy
rapturous and frightened and utterly torn asunder from her old calm
thinking self

He put her downreleased her

Nothin could have made me so happy as what you said He finished with
a strong sigh of unutterable wondering joy

Then you will not go toto meet

Helens happy query froze on her lips

Ive got to go he rejoined with his old quiet voice Hurry in to
Bo An dont worry Try to think of things as I taught you up in the
woods

Helen heard his soft padded footfalls swiftly pass away She was left
there alone in the darkening twilight suddenly cold and stricken as
if turned to stone

Thus she stood an agelong moment until the upflashing truth galvanized
her into action Then she flew in pursuit of Dale The truth was that
in spite of Dales early training in the East and the long years of
solitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling he had
also become a part of this raw bold and violent West

It was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw
Dales tall dark form against the yellow light of Turners saloon

Somehow in that poignant moment when her flying feet kept pace with
her heart Helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this
raw primitive justice of the West She was one of the first influences
emanating from civilized life from law and order In that flash of
truth she saw the West as it would be some future time when through
women and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever Also
just as clearly she saw the present need of men like Roy Beeman and Dale
and the fireblooded Carmichael Beasley and his kind must be killed
But Helen did not want her lover her future husband and the probable
father of her children to commit what she held to be murder

At the door of the saloon she caught up with Dale

Miltohwaitwait she panted

She heard him curse under his breath as he turned They were alone in
the yellow flare of light Horses were champing bits and drooping before
the rails

You go back ordered Dale sternly His face was pale his eyes were
gleaming

No Not tillyou take meor carry me she replied resolutely with
all a womans positive and inevitable assurance

Then he laid hold of her with ungentle hands His violence especially
the look on his face terrified Helen rendered her weak But nothing
could have shaken her resolve She felt victory Her sex her love and
her presence would be too much for Dale

As he swung Helen around the low hum of voices inside the saloon
suddenly rose to sharp hoarse roars accompanied by a scuffling of feet
and crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables Dale let go of Helen
and leaped toward the door But a silence inside quicker and stranger
than the roar halted him Helens heart contracted then seemed to
cease beating There was absolutely not a perceptible sound Even the
horses appeared like Dale to have turned to statues

Two thundering shots annihilated this silence Then quickly came a
lighter shotthe smash of glass Dale ran into the saloon The horses
began to snort to rear to pound A low muffled murmur terrified Helen
even as it drew her Dashing at the door she swung it in and entered

The place was dim bluehazed smelling of smoke Dale stood just inside
the door On the floor lay two men Chairs and tables were overturned
A motley dark shirtsleeved booted and belted crowd of men appeared
hunched against the opposite wall with pale set faces turned to the
bar Turner the proprietor stood at one end his face livid his hands
aloft and shaking Carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar He
held a gun low down It was smoking

With a gasp Helen flashed her eyes back to Dale He had seen herwas
reaching an arm toward her Then she saw the man lying almost at her
feet Jeff Mulveyher uncles old foreman His face was awful to
behold A smoking gun lay near his inert hand The other man had fallen
on his face His garb proclaimed him a Mexican He was not yet dead
Then Helen as she felt Dales arm encircle her looked farther because
she could not prevent itlooked on at that strange figure against the
barthis boy who had been such a friend in her hour of needthis naive
and frank sweetheart of her sisters

She saw a man nowwild white intense as fire with some terrible cool
kind of deadliness in his mien His left elbow rested upon the bar and
his hand held a glass of red liquor The big gun low down in his other
hand seemed as steady as if it were a fixture

Heahs to thethalfbreed Beasley an his outfit

Carmichael drank while his flaming eyes held the crowd then with
savage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering
form of the still living Mexican on the floor

Helen felt herself slipping All seemed to darken around her She could
not see Dale though she knew he held her Then she fainted



CHAPTER XXV

Las Vegas Carmichael was a product of his day

The Pan Handle of Texas the old Chisholm Trail along which were
driven the great cattle herds northward Fort Dodge where the cowboys
conflicted with the cardsharpsthese hard places had left their marks
on Carmichael To come from Texas was to come from fighting stock And
a cowboys life was strenuous wild violent and generally brief The
exceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns and they
drifted from south to north and west taking with them the reckless
chivalrous vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed

The pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the West
habitable had it not been for these wild cowboys these harddrinking
hardriding hardliving rangers of the barrens these easy cool
laconic simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who
possessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death

Las Vegas ran his horse from Widow Casss cottage to Turners saloon
and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door Las Vegass
entrance was a leap Then he stood still with the door ajar and the
horse pounding and snorting back All the men in that saloon who saw the
entrance of Las Vegas knew what it portended No thunderbolt could
have more quickly checked the drinking gambling talking crowd They
recognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival
For a second the bluehazed room was perfectly quiet then men breathed
moved rose and suddenly caused a quick sliding crash of chairs and
tables

The cowboys glittering eyes flashed to and fro and then fixed on
Mulvey and his Mexican companion That glance singled out these two and
the sudden rush of nervous men proved it Mulvey and the sheepherder
were left alone in the center of the floor

Howdy Jeff Wheres your boss asked Las Vegas His voice was cool
friendly his manner was easy natural but the look of him was what
made Mulvey pale and the Mexican livid

Reckon hes home replied Mulvey

Home Whats he call home now

Hes hangin out hyar at Auchinclosss replied Mulvey His voice was
not strong but his eyes were steady watchful

Las Vegas quivered all over as if stung A flame that seemed white and
red gave his face a singular hue

Jeff you worked for old Al a long time an Ive heard of your
differences said Las Vegas Thet aint no mix of mine But you
doublecrossed Miss Helen

Mulvey made no attempt to deny this He gulped slowly His hands
appeared less steady and he grew paler Again Las Vegass words
signified less than his look And that look now included the Mexican

Pedro youre one of Beasleys old hands said Las Vegas accusingly
Anyou was one of them four greasers thet

Here the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material
poison The Mexican showed his guilt and cowardice He began to jabber

Shet up hissed Las Vegas with a savage and significant jerk of
his arm as if about to strike But that action was read for its true
meaning Pellmell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open
space behind the three

Las Vegas waited But Mulvey seemed obstructed The Mexican looked
dangerous through his fear His fingers twitched as if the tendons
running up into his arms were being pulled

An instant of suspensemore than long enough for Mulvey to be tried and
found wantingand Las Vegas with laugh and sneer turned his back upon
the pair and stepped to the bar His call for a bottle made Turner jump
and hold it out with shaking hands Las Vegas poured out a drink while
his gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar

This turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what
kind of a school Las Vegas had been trained in If those men had been
worthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them As it
was when Mulvey and the Mexican jerked at their guns Las Vegas swiftly
wheeled and shot twice Mulveys gun went off as he fell and the
Mexican doubled up in a heap on the floor Then Las Vegas reached around
with his left hand for the drink he had poured out

At this juncture Dale burst into the saloon suddenly to check his
impetus to swerve aside toward the bar and halt The door had not
ceased swinging when again it was propelled inward this time to admit
Helen Rayner white and wideeyed

In another moment then Las Vegas had spoken his deadly toast to
Beasleys gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing Mexican
on the floor Also Dale had gravitated toward the reeling Helen to catch
her when she fainted

Las Vegas began to curse and striding to Dale he pushed him out of
the saloon

 What re you doin heah he yelled stridently Hevnt you got
thet girl to think of Then do it you big Indian Lettin her run after
you heahriskin herself thet way You take care of her an Bo an
leave this deal to me

The cowboy furious as he was at Dale yet had keen swift eyes for the
horses near at hand and the men out in the dim light Dale lifted
the girl into his arms and turning without a word stalked away to
disappear in the darkness Las Vegas holding his gun low returned to
the barroom If there had been any change in the crowd it was slight
The tension had relaxed Turner no longer stood with hands up

Youall go on with your fun called the cowboy with a sweep of his
gun But itd be risky fer any one to start leavin

With that he backed against the bar near where the black bottle stood
Turner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs and presently the
crowd with some caution and suspense resumed their games and drinking
It was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door From
time to time Turner served liquor to men who called for it

Las Vegas leaned with back against the bar After a while he sheathed
his gun and reached around for the bottle He drank with his piercing
eyes upon the door No one entered and no one went out The games
of chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed It was a hard
scenethat smoky long illsmelling room with its dim yellow lights
and dark evil faces with the stealthystepping Turner passing to and
fro and the dead Mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling
and the Mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently then
lay still and with the drinking somber waiting cowboy more fiery and
more flaming with every drink listening for a step that did not come

Time passed and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy Drink
affected him but he did not become drunk It seemed that the liquor he
drank was consumed by a mounting fire It was fuel to a driving passion
He grew more sullen somber brooding redder of eye and face more
crouching and restless At last when the hour was so late that there
was no probability of Beasley appearing Las Vegas flung himself out of
the saloon

All lights of the village had now been extinguished The tired horses
drooped in the darkness Las Vegas found his horse and led him away down
the road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in
the starlight Morning was not far off He unsaddled the horse and
turning him loose went into the barn Here he seemed familiar with
his surroundings for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft where he
threw himself on the hay

He rested but did not sleep At daylight he went down and brought his
horse into the barn Sunrise found Las Vegas pacing to and fro the short
length of the interior and peering out through wide cracks between
the boards Then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched
the occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the
village

About the breakfast hour Las Vegas saddled his horse and rode back the
way he had come the night before At Turners he called for something
to eat as well as for whisky After that he became a listening watching
machine He drank freely for an hour then he stopped He seemed to
be drunk but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in
drinking men Savage fierce sullen he was one to avoid Turner waited
on him in evident fear

At length Las Vegass condition became such that action was involuntary
He could not stand still nor sit down Stalking out he passed the
store where men slouched back to avoid him and he went down the road
wary and alert as if he expected a rifleshot from some hidden enemy
Upon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person
was to be seen He went in to Turners The proprietor was there at his
post nervous and pale Las Vegas did not order any more liquor

Turner I reckon Ill bore you next time I run in heah he said and
stalked out

He had the stores the road the village to himself and he patrolled a
beat like a sentry watching for an Indian attack

Toward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the
cowboy

Las Vegas Im tellin youall the greasers air leavin the range he
said

Howdy Abe replied Las Vegas What n hell you talkin about

The man repeated his information And Las Vegas spat out frightful
curses

Abeyou heah what Beasleys doin

Yes Hes with his menup at the ranch Reckon he cant put off ridin
down much longer

That was where the West spoke Beasley would be forced to meet the enemy
who had come out singlehanded against him Long before this hour a
braver man would have come to face Las Vegas Beasley could not hire
any gang to bear the brunt of this situation This was the test by which
even his own men must judge him All of which was to say that as the
wildness of the West had made possible his crimes so it now held him
responsible for them

Abe if thetgreaser dont rustle down heah Im goin after him

Sure But dont be in no hurry replied Abe

Im waltzin to slow music Gimme a smoke

With fingers that slightly trembled Abe rolled a cigarette lit it from
his own and handed it to the cowboy

Las Vegas I reckon I hear hosses he said suddenly

Me too replied Las Vegas with his head high like that of a
listening deer Apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend
Abe hurried back to the store where he disappeared

Las Vegas began his stalking up and down and his action now was an
exaggeration of all his former movements A rational ordinary mortal
from some Eastern community happening to meet this redfaced cowboy
would have considered him drunk or crazy Probably Las Vegas looked
both But all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and
efficient instrument to meet the portending issue How many thousands of
times on the trails and in the widestreeted little towns all over the
West had this stalk of the cowboys been perpetrated Violent bloody
tragic as it was it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the
use of a horse or the need of a plow

At length Pine was apparently a deserted village except for Las Vegas
who patrolled his long beat in many wayshe lounged while he
watched he stalked like a mountaineer he stole along Indian fashion
stealthily from tree to tree from corner to corner he disappeared in
the saloon to reappear at the back he slipped round behind the barns to
come out again in the main road and time after time he approached his
horse as if deciding to mount

The last visit he made into Turners saloon he found no one there
Savagely he pounded on the bar with his gun He got no response Then
the longpentup rage burst With wild whoops he pulled another gun and
shot at the mirror the lamps He shot the neck off a bottle and drank
till he choked his neck corded bulging and purple His only slow and
deliberate action was the reloading of his gun Then he crashed through
the doors and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle hauling
his horse up high and goading him to plunge away

Men running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust
flying down the road And then they trooped out to see it disappear The
hour of suspense ended for them Las Vegas had lived up to the code of
the West had dared his man out had waited far longer than needful to
prove that man a coward Whatever the issue now Beasley was branded
forever That moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded
He and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face
him but that would not change the brand

The preceding night Beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his
newly acquired ranch when Buck Weaver one of his men burst in upon
him with news of the death of Mulvey and Pedro

Whos in the outfit How many he had questioned quickly

Its a oneman outfit boss replied Weaver

Beasley appeared astounded He and his men had prepared to meet the
friends of the girl whose property he had taken over and because of the
superiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended
feud This amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult
form

One man he ejaculated

Yep Thet cowboy Las Vegas An boss he turns out to be a gunslinger
from Texas I was in Turners Hed jest happened to step in the other
room when Las Vegas come bustin in on his hoss an jumped off Fust
thing he called Jeff an Pedro They both showed yaller An then damn
if thet cowboy didnt turn his back on them an went to the bar fer a
drink But he was lookin in the mirror an when Jeff an Pedro went fer
their guns why he whirled quick as lightnin an bored them both I
sneaked out an

Why didnt you bore him roared Beasley

Buck Weaver steadily eyed his boss before he replied I aint
takin shots at any fellar from behind doors An as fer meetin Las
Vegasexcoose me boss Ive still a hankerin fer sunshine an red
liquor Besides I aint got nothin agin Las Vegas If hes rustled
over here at the head of a crowd to put us off Id fight jest as wed
all fight But you see we figgered wrong Its between you an Las
Vegas You oughter seen him throw thet hunter Dale out of Turners

Dale Did he come queried Beasley

He got there just after the cowboy plugged Jeff An thet bigeyed
girl she came runnin in too An she keeled over in Dales arms Las
Vegas shoved him outcussed him so hard we all heerd So Beasley
there aint no fight comin off as we figgered on

Beasley thus heard the West speak out of the mouth of his own man And
grim sardonic almost scornful indeed were the words of Buck Weaver
This rider had once worked for Al Auchincloss and had deserted to
Beasley under Mulveys leadership Mulvey was dead and the situation was
vastly changed

Beasley gave Weaver a dark lowering glance and waved him away From
the door Weaver sent back a doubtful scrutinizing gaze then slouched
out That gaze Beasley had not encountered before

It meant as Weavers cronies meant as Beasleys longfaithful riders
and the people of the range and as the spirit of the West meant that
Beasley was expected to march down into the village to face his single
foe

But Beasley did not go Instead he paced to and fro the length of Helen
Rayners long sittingroom with the nervous energy of a man who
could not rest Many times he hesitated and at others he made sudden
movements toward the door only to halt Long after midnight he went
to bed but not to sleep He tossed and rolled all night and at dawn
arose gloomy and irritable

He cursed the Mexican servingwomen who showed their displeasure at
his authority And to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to
the house He waited and waited Then he stalked off to the corrals and
stables carrying a rifle with him The men were there in a group that
dispersed somewhat at his advent Not a Mexican was in sight

Beasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into
the village with him That order was disobeyed Beasley stormed and
raged His riders sat or lounged with lowered faces An unspoken
hostility seemed present Those who had been longest with him were least
distant and strange but still they did not obey At length Beasley
roared for his Mexicans

Boss we gotta tell you thet every greaser on the ranch hes
slopedgone these two hourson the way to Magdalena said Buck
Weaver

Of all these suddenuprising perplexities this latest was the most
astounding Beasley cursed with his questioning wonder

Boss they was sure scared of thet gunslingin cowboy from Texas
replied Weaver imperturbably

Beasleys dark swarthy face changed its hue What of the subtle
reflection in Weavers slow speech One of the men came out of a corral
leading Beasleys saddled and bridled horse This fellow dropped the
bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word No one spoke The
presence of the horse was significant With a snarling muttered curse
Beasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranchhouse

In his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for
hoursthat if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well
as for his life the hour was long past

Beasley avoided the open paths to the house and when he got there he
nervously poured out a drink Evidently something in the fiery liquor
frightened him for he threw the bottle aside It was as if that bottle
contained a courage which was false

Again he paced the long sittingroom growing more and more wroughtup
as evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs Twice
the pale servingwoman called him to dinner

The diningroom was light and pleasant and the meal fragrant and
steaming was ready for him But the women had disappeared Beasley
seated himselfspread out his big hands on the table

Then a slight rustlea clink of spurstartled him He twisted his
head

Howdy Beasley said Las Vegas who had appeared as if by magic

Beasleys frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his
veins Sweatdrops stood out on his pallid face

Whatyouwant he asked huskily

Wal now my boss Miss Helen says seein I am foreman heah thet itd
be nice an proper fer me to drop in an eat with youTHE LAST TIME
replied the cowboy His drawl was slow and cool his tone was friendly
and pleasant But his look was that of a falcon ready to drive deep its
beak

Beasleys reply was loud incoherent hoarse

Las Vegas seated himself across from Beasley

Eat or not its shore all the same to me said Las Vegas and he
began to load his plate with his left hand His right hand rested very
lightly with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of
the table and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his
piercing eyes off Beasley

Wal my halfbreed greaser guest it shore roils up my blood to see you
sittin therethinkin youve put my boss Miss Helen off this ranch
began Las Vegas softly And then he helped himself leisurely to food
and drink In my day Ive shore stacked up against a lot of outlaws
thieves rustlers an sich like but fer an out an out dirty lowdown
skunk you shore take the dough Im goin to kill you in a minit or
so jest as soon as you move one of them dirty paws of yourn But I hope
youll be polite an let me say a few words Ill never be happy again
if you dont Of all theyaller greaser dogs I ever seen youre the
worst I was thinkin last night mebbe youd come down an meet me
like a man so s I could wash my hands ever afterward without gettin
sick to my stummick But you didnt come Beasley Im so ashamed of
myself thet I gotta call youwhen I ought to bore you thetI aint
even second cousin to my old self when I rode fer Chisholm It dont
mean nuthin to you to call you liar robber blackleg a sneakin
coyote an a cheat thet hires others to do his dirty work By
Gawd

Carmichael gimme a word in hoarsely broke out Beasley Youre
right it wont do no good to call me But lets talk Ill buy
you off Ten thousand dollars

Haw Haw Haw roared Las Vegas He was as tense as a strung cord and
his face possessed a singular pale radiance His right hand began to
quiver more and more

Illdoubleit panted Beasley Illmake overhalf the
ranchall the stock

Swaller thet yelled Las Vegas with terrible strident ferocity

Listenman I takeit back Ill give upAuchinclosss ranch
Beasley was now a shaking whispering frenzied man ghastly white with
rolling eyes

Las Vegass left fist pounded hard on the table

GREASER COME ON he thundered

Then Beasley with desperate frantic action jerked for his gun



CHAPTER XXVI

For Helen Rayner that brief dark period of expulsion from her home had
become a thing of the past almost forgotten

Two months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of
finding her place there in the West All her old men had been only too
glad of the opportunity to come back to her and under Dale and Roy
Beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch

Helen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of
rooms and adding a new section Only once had she ventured into the old
diningroom where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner
for Beasley She made a storeroom of it and a place she would never
again enter

Helen was happy almost too happy she thought and therefore made
more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of
life Carmichael had ridden out of Pine ostensibly on the trail of the
Mexicans who had executed Beasleys commands The last seen of him
had been reported from Show Down where he had appeared redeyed and
dangerous like a hound on a scent Then two months had flown by without
a word

Dale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboys
absence It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again
Also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his
drunken savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by
his friends Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than
Helen But Bo grew more restless wilder and more wilful than ever
Helen thought she guessed Bos secret and once she ventured a hint
concerning Carmichaels return

If Tom doesnt come back pretty soon Ill marry Milt Dale retorted
Bo tauntingly

This fired Helens cheeks with red

But child she protested half angry half grave Milt and I are
engaged

Sure Only youre so slow Theres many a slipyou know

Bo I tell you Tom will come back replied Helen earnestly I feel
it There was something fine in that cowboy He understood me better
than you or Milt either And he was perfectly wild in love with
you

Oh WAS he

Very much more than you deserved Bo Rayner

Then occurred one of Bos sweet bewildering unexpected
transformations Her defiance resentment rebelliousness vanished from
a softly agitated face

Oh Nell I know that You just watch me if I ever get another
chance at him Thenmaybe hed never drink again

Bo be happyand be good Dont ride off any moredont tease the
boys Itll all come right in the end

Bo recovered her equanimity quickly enough

Humph You can afford to be cheerful Youve got a man who cant live
when youre out of his sight Hes like a fish on dry land And
youwhy once you were an old pessimist

Bo was not to be consoled or changed Helen could only sigh and pray
that her convictions would be verified


The first day of July brought an early thunderstorm just at sunrise
It roared and flared and rolled away leaving a gorgeous golden cloud
pageant in the sky and a fresh sweetly smelling glistening green range
that delighted Helens eye

Birds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the
flowers From the fields down along the brook came a blended song of
swampblackbird and meadowlark A clarionvoiced burro split the air
with his coarse and homely bray The sheep were bleating and a soft baa
of little lambs came sweetly to Helens ears She went her usual rounds
with more than usual zest and thrill Everywhere was color activity
life The wind swept warm and pinescented down from the mountain
heights now black and bold and the great green slopes seemed to call
to her

At that very moment she came suddenly upon Dale in his shirtsleeves
dusty and hot standing motionless gazing at the distant mountains
Helens greeting startled him

II was just looking away yonder he said smiling She thrilled at
the clear wonderful light of his eyes

So was Ia moment ago she replied wistfully Do you miss the
forestvery much

Nell I miss nothing But Id like to ride with you under the pines
once more

Well go she cried

When he asked eagerly

Ohsoon And then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on
For long Helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in
Paradise Park where she had fallen in love with Dale and had realized
herself But she had kept that hope secret Dales eager tone his
flashing eyes had made her feel that her secret was there in her
telltale face

As she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the
new stableboys driving a packmule

Jim whose pack is that she asked

Maam I dunno but I heard him tell Roy he reckoned his name was mud
replied the boy smiling

Helens heart gave a quick throb That sounded like Las Vegas She
hurried on and upon entering the courtyard she espied Roy Beeman
holding the halter of a beautiful wildlooking mustang There was
another horse with another man who was in the act of dismounting on the
far side When he stepped into better view Helen recognized Las Vegas
And he saw her at the same instant

Helen did not look up again until she was near the porch She had
dreaded this meeting yet she was so glad that she could have cried
aloud

Miss Helen I shore am glad to see you he said standing bareheaded
before her the same young frankfaced cowboy she had seen first from
the train

Tom she exclaimed and offered her hands

He wrung them hard while he looked at her The swift womans glance
Helen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of
her heart This was the same boy she had knownwhom she had liked so
wellwho had won her sisters love Helen imagined facing him thus was
like awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt Carmichaels face was
clean fresh young with its healthy tan it wore the old glad smile
cool easy and natural his eyes were like Dalespenetrating clear
as crystal without a shadow What had evil drink blood to do
with the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of Western
hardihood Wherever he had been whatever he had done during that
long absence he had returned long separated from that wild and savage
character she could now forget Perhaps there would never again be call
for it

Hows my girl he asked just as naturally as if he had been gone a
few days on some errand of his employers

Bo Oh shes wellfine II rather think shell be glad to see you
replied Helen warmly

An hows thet big Indian Dale he drawled

Well tooIm sure

Reckon I got back heah in time to see youall married

II assure you Ino one around here has been married yet replied
Helen with a blush

Thet shore is fine Was some worried he said lazily Ive been
chasin wild hosses over in New Mexico an I got after this heah blue
roan He kept me chasin him fer a spell Ive fetched him back for Bo

Helen looked at the mustang Roy was holding to be instantly delighted
He was a roan almost blue in color neither large nor heavy but
powerfully built cleanlimbed and racy with a long mane and tail
black as coal and a beautiful head that made Helen love him at once

Well Im jealous declared Helen archly I never did see such a
pony

I reckoned youd never ride any hoss but Ranger said Las Vegas

No I never will But I can be jealous anyhow cant I

Shore An I reckon if you say youre goin to have himwal Bo d be
funny he drawled

I reckon she would be funny retorted Helen She was so happy that
she imitated his speech She wanted to hug him It was too good to be
truethe return of this cowboy He understood her He had come back
with nothing that could alienate her He had apparently forgotten the
terrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her
enemies That moment was wonderful for Helen in its revelation of the
strange significance of the West as embodied in this cowboy He was
great But he did not know that

Then the door of the livingroom opened and a sweet high voice pealed
out

Roy Oh what a mustang Whose is he

Wal Bo if all I hear is so he belongs to you replied Roy with a
huge grin

Bo appeared in the door She stepped out upon the porch She saw the
cowboy The excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled

Bo I shore am glad to see you drawled Las Vegas as he stepped
forward sombrero in hand Helen could not see any sign of confusion in
him But indeed she saw gladness Then she expected to behold Bo run
right into the cowboyss arms It appeared however that she was doomed
to disappointment

Tom Im glad to see you she replied

They shook hands as old friends

Youre lookin right fine he said

Oh Im well And how have you been these six months she queried

Reckon I though it was longer he drawled Wal Im pretty tiptop
now but I was laid up with heart trouble for a spell

Heart trouble she echoed dubiously

Shore I ate too much over heah in New Mexico

Its no news to mewhere your hearts located laughed Bo Then she
ran off the porch to see the blue mustang She walked round and round
him clasping her hands in sheer delight

Bo hes a plumb dandy said Roy Never seen a prettier hoss Hell
run like a streak An hes got good eyes Hell be a pet some day But
I reckon hell always be spunky

Bo ventured to step closer and at last got a hand on the mustang and
then another She smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him
until he submitted to her hold

Whats his name she asked

Blue somethin or other replied Roy

Tom has my new mustang a name asked Bo turning to the cowboy

Shore

What then

Wal I named him BlueBo answered Las Vegas with a smile

BlueBoy

Nope Hes named after you An I chased him roped him broke him all
myself

Very well BlueBo he is then And hes a wonderful darling horse
Oh Nell just look at him Tom I cant thank you enough

Reckon I dont want any thanks drawled the cowboy But see heah Bo
you shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him

What exclaimed Bo who was startled by his slow cool meaning tone
of voice

Helen delighted in looking at Las Vegas then He had never appeared to
better advantage So cool careless and assured He seemed master of
a situation in which his terms must be accepted Yet he might have been
actuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of Helen to divine

Bo Rayner drawled Las Vegas thet blue mustang will be yours an
you can ride himwhen youre MRS TOM CARMICHAEL

Never had he spoken a softer more drawling speech nor gazed at Bo
more mildly Roy seemed thunderstruck Helen endeavored heroically to
restrain her delicious bursting glee Bos wide eyes stared at her
loverdarkeneddilated Suddenly she left the mustang to confront the
cowboy where he lounged on the porch steps

Do you mean that she cried

Shore do

Bah Its only a magnificent bluff she retorted Youre only in fun
Its youryour darned nerve

Why Bo began Las Vegas reproachfully You shore know Im not the
fourflusher kind Never got away with a bluff in my life An Im jest
in daid earnest aboot this heah

All the same signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was
almost unable to restrain his mirth

Helen realized then that Bo saw through the cowboythat the ultimatum
was only one of his tricks

It IS a bluff and I CALL you declared Bo ringingly

Las Vegas suddenly awoke to consequences He essayed to speak but she
was so wonderful then so white and blazingeyed that he was stricken
mute

Ill ride BlueBo this afternoon deliberately stated the girl

Las Vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning and he seemed about to
collapse

Very well you can make me Mrs Tom Carmichael todaythis
morningjust before dinner Go get a preacher to marry usand
make yourself look a more presentable bridegroomUNLESS IT WAS ONLY A
BLUFF

Her imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed
to make Las Vegas a blank stone image of a man With a wildrose color
suffusing her face she swiftly bent over him kissed him and flashed
away into the house Her laugh pealed back and it thrilled Helen so
deep and strange was it for the wilful sister so wild and merry and
full of joy

It was then that Roy Beeman recovered from his paralysis to let out
such a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses Helen was laughing and
crying too but laughing mostly Las Vegas Carmichael was a sight for
the gods to behold Bos kiss had unclamped what had bound him The
sudden truth undeniable insupportable glorious made him a madman

Bluffshe called meride BlueBo safternoon he raved
reaching wildly for Helen MrsTomCarmichaelbefore
dinnerpreacherpresentable bridegroom Aw Im drunk again Iwho
swore off forever

No Tom youre just happy said Helen

Between her and Roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the
situation and to see his wonderful opportunity

Nownow Miss Helenwhatd Bo mean by prepresentable bridegroom
Presents Lord Im clean busted flat

She meant you must dress up in your best of course replied Helen

Where n earth will I get a preacher Show Downs forty miles
Cant ride there in time Roy Ive gotta have a preacher Life or
death deal fer me

Wal old man if youll brace up Ill marry you to Bo said Roy with
his glad grin

Aw gasped Las Vegas as if at the coming of a sudden beautiful hope

Tom Im a preacher replied Roy now earnestly You didnt know
thet but I am An I can marry you an Bo as good as any one an
tighter n most

Las Vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached
for solid rock

Roy can you really marry themwith my Bibleand the service of my
church asked Helen a happy hope flushing her face

Wal indeed I can Ive married more n one couple whose religion
wasnt mine

Bbbeforedddinner burst out Las Vegas like a stuttering idiot

I reckon Come on now an make yourself presenttible said Roy
Miss Helen you tell Bo thet its all settled

He picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the
corrals Las Vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm and seemed
to be following in a trance with his dazed rapt face held high

Bring Dale called Helen softly after them


So it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that Bo rode the blue
mustang before the afternoon ended

Las Vegas disobeyed his first orders from Mrs Tom Carmichael and rode
out after her toward the greenrising range Helen seemed impelled to
follow She did not need to ask Dale the second time They rode swiftly
but never caught up with Bo and Las Vegas whose riding resembled their
happiness

Dale read Helens mind or else his own thoughts were in harmony with
hers for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking And as they
rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a
few days to visit his old camp

And take Boand Tom Oh of all things Id like to she replied

Yesan Roy too added Dale significantly

Of course said Helen lightly as if she had not caught his meaning
But she turned her eyes away while her heart thumped disgracefully and
all her body was aglow Will Tom and Bo go

It was Tom who got me to ask you replied Dale John an Hal can look
after the men while were gone

Ohso Tom put it in your head I guessmaybeI wont go

It is always in my mind Nell he said with his slow seriousness
Im goin to work all my life for you But Ill want to an need to go
back to the woods often An if you ever stoop to marry mean make
me the richest of menyoull have to marry me up there where I fell in
love with you

Ah Did Las Vegas Tom Carmichael say that too inquired Helen
softly

Nell do you want to know what Las Vegas said

By all means

He said thisan not an hour ago Milt old hoss let me give you a
hunch Im a man of family nowan Ive been a devil with the wimmen
in my day I can see through em Dont marry Nell Rayner in or near the
house where I killed Beasley Shed remember An dont let her remember
thet day Go off into the woods Paradise Park Bo an me will go with
you

Helen gave him her hand while they walked the horses homeward in the
long sunset shadows In the fullness of that happy hour she had time for
a grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy Carmichael Dale
had saved her life but it was Las Vegas who had saved her happiness


Not many days later when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low
Helen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far
above Paradise Park

Roy was singing as he drove the packburros down the slope Bo and Las
Vegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast so they could hold
hands Dale had dismounted to stand beside Helens horse as she gazed
down the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray
meadows and shining ribbons of brooks

It was July and there were no goldenred glorious flames and blazes of
color such as lingered in Helens memory Black spruce slopes and green
pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark
outcroppings of rockthese colors and forms greeted her gaze with all
the old enchantment Wildness beauty and loneliness were there the
same as ever immutable like the spirit of those heights

Helen would fain have lingered longer but the others called and Ranger
impatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below And she
knew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be
another woman

Nell come on said Dale as he led on Its better to look up


The sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountainrim when
those three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and
had prepared a bountiful supper Then Roy Beeman took out the little
worn Bible which Helen had given him to use when he married Bo and as
he opened it a light changed his dark face

Come Helen an Dale he said

They arose to stand before him And he married them there under the
great stately pines with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward and
the wind singing through the branches while the waterfall murmured its
low soft dreamy music and from the dark slope came the wild lonely
cry of a wolf full of the hunger for life and a mate

Let us pray said Roy as he closed the Bible and knelt with them

There is only one God an Him I beseech in my humble office for the
woman an man I have just wedded in holy bonds Bless them an watch
them an keep them through all the comin years Bless the sons of
this strong man of the woods an make them like him with love an
understandin of the source from which life comes Bless the daughters
of this woman an send with them more of her love an soul which must
be the softenin an the salvation of the hard West O Lord blaze the
dim dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life O Lord
lead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows We
ask in Thy name Amen

When the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their
kneeling posture it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left
him This young man was again the darkfaced cleareyed Roy droll and
dry with the enigmatic smile on his lips

Mrs Dale he said taking her hands I wish you joy An now
after this here my crownin service in your behalfI reckon Ill claim
a reward

Then he kissed her Bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations
and the cowboy with characteristic action also made at Helen

Nell shore its the only chance Ill ever have to kiss you he
drawled Because when this heah big Indian once finds out what kissin
is

Las Vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions
All this left Helen red and confused and unutterably happy She
appreciated Dales state His eyes reflected the precious treasure
which manifestly he saw but realization of ownership had not yet become
demonstrable

Then with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook
of the supper When it was finished Roy made known his intention to
leave They all protested and coaxed but to no avail He only laughed
and went on saddling his horse

Roy please stay implored Helen The days almost ended Youre
tired

Nope Ill never be no third party when theres only two

But there are four of us

Didnt I just make you an Dale one An Mrs Dale you forget Ive
been married more n once

Helen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument
Las Vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth Dale looked strange

Roy then thats why youre so nice said Bo with a little devil in
her eyes Do you know I had my mind made up if Tom hadnt come around I
was going to make up to you Roy I sure was What number wife would
I have been

It always took Bo to turn the tables on anybody Roy looked mightily
embarrassed And the laugh was on him He did not face them again until
he had mounted

Las Vegas Ive done my best for youhitched you to thet blueeyed
girl the best I know how he declared But I shore aint guaranteein
nothin Youd better build a corral for her

Why Roy you shore dont savvy the way to break these wild ones
drawled Las Vegas Bo will be eatin out of my hand in about a week

Bos blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary
claim

Goodby friends said Roy and rode away to disappear in the spruces

Thereupon Bo and Las Vegas forgot Roy and Dale and Helen the camp
chores to be done and everything else except themselves Helens first
wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her
husband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper Before
they had finished a sound startled them It came from Roy evidently
high on the darkening slope and was a long mellow pealing halloo that
rang on the cool air burst the dreamy silence and rapped across
from slope to slope and cliff to cliff to lose its power and die away
hauntingly in the distant recesses

Dale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that
beautiful call Silence once again enfolded the park and twilight
seemed to be born of the air drifting downward

Nell do you miss anythin asked Dale

No Nothing in all the world she murmured I am happier than I ever
dared pray to be

I dont mean people or things I mean my pets

Ah I had forgotten Milt where are they

Gone back to the wild he said They had to live in my absence An
Ive been away long

Just then the brooding silence with its soft murmur of falling water
and faint sigh of wind in the pines was broken by a piercing scream
high quivering like that of a woman in exquisite agony

Thats Tom exclaimed Dale

OhI was soso frightened whispered Helen

Bo came running with Las Vegas at her heels

Milt that was your tame cougar cried Bo excitedly Oh Ill never
forget him Ill hear those cries in my dreams

Yes it was Tom said Dale thoughtfully But I never heard him cry
just like that

Oh call him in

Dale whistled and called but Tom did not come Then the hunter stalked
off in the gloom to call from different points under the slope After
a while he returned without the cougar And at that moment from far
up the dark ravine drifted down the same wild cry only changed by
distance strange and tragic in its meaning

He scented us He remembers But hell never come back said Dale


Helen felt stirred anew with the convictions of Dales deep knowledge of
life and nature And her imagination seemed to have wings How full and
perfect her trust her happiness in the realization that her love and
her future her children and perhaps grandchildren would come under
the guidance of such a man Only a little had she begun to comprehend
the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature
Ages before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of
the wilderness and the holes of the rocks and the nests of the trees
and rain frost heat dew sunlight and night storm and calm the
honey of the wildflower and the instinct of the beeall the beautiful
and multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design To know
something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of
earthperhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven For whatever breathed
and moved was a part of that creation The coo of the dove the lichen
on the mossy rock the mourn of a hunting wolf and the murmur of the
waterfall the evergreen and growing tips of the spruces and the
thunderbolts along the battlements of the heightsthese one and all
must be actuated by the great spiritthat incalculable thing in the
universe which had produced man and soul

And there in the starlight under the widegnarled pines sighing low
with the wind Helen sat with Dale on the old stone that an avalanche
of a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as
camptable and bench for lovers in the wilderness the sweet scent of
spruce mingled with the fragrance of woodsmoke blown in their faces
How white the stars and calm and true How they blazed their single
task A coyote yelped off on the south slope dark now as midnight A
bit of weathered rock rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf And the
wind moaned Helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this
lonely fastness and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness
that all would some day be well with the troubled world beyond

Nell Ill homestead this park said Dale Then itll always be
ours

Homestead Whats that murmured Helen dreamily The word sounded
sweet

The government will give land to men who locate an build replied
Dale Well run up a log cabin

And come here often Paradise Park whispered Helen

Dales first kisses were on her lips then hard and cool and clean like
the life of the man singularly exalting to her completing her womans
strange and unutterable joy of the hour and rendering her mute

Bos melodious laugh and her voice with its old mockery of torment
drifted softly on the night breeze And the cowboys Aw Bo drawling
his reproach and longing was all that the tranquil waiting silence
needed

Paradise Park was living again one of its romances Love was no stranger
to that lonely fastness Helen heard in the whisper of the wind through
the pine the oldearth story beautiful ever new and yet eternal
She thrilled to her depths The sparpointed spruces stood up black
and clear against the noble stars All that vast solitude breathed and
waited charged full with its secret ready to reveal itself to her
tremulous soul
