ANDREW LANGS INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPLEAT ANGLER


To write on Walton is indeed to hold a candle to the sun The editor
has been content to give a summary of the chief or rather the only known
events in Waltons long life adding a notice of his character as
displayed in his Biographies and in _The Compleat Angler_ with comments
on the ancient and modern practice of fishing illustrated by passages
from Waltons foregoers and contemporaries Like all editors of Walton
he owes much to his predecessors Sir John Hawkins Oldys Major and
above all to the learned Sir Harris Nicolas




HIS LIFE


The few events in the long life of Izaak Walton have been carefully
investigated by Sir Harris Nicolas All that can be extricated from
documents by the alchemy of research has been selected and I am unaware
of any important acquisitions since Sir Harris Nicolass second edition
of 1860 Izaak was of an old family of Staffordshire yeomen probably
descendants of George Walton of Yoxhall who died in 1571 Izaaks
father was Jarvis Walton who died in February 15956 of Izaaks mother
nothing is known Izaak himself was born at Stafford on August 9 1593
and was baptized on September 21 He died on December 15 1683 having
lived in the reigns of Elizabeth James I Charles I under the
Commonwealth and under Charles II The anxious and changeful age
through which he passed is in contrast with his very pacific character
and tranquil pursuits

Of Waltons education nothing is known except on the evidence of his
writings He may have read Latin but most of the books he cites had
English translations Did he learn his religion from his mother or his
nurse It will be seen that the free speculation of his age left him
untouched perhaps his piety was awakened from childhood under the
instruction of a pious mother Had he been orphaned of both parents as
has been suggested he might have been less amenable to authority and a
less notable example of the virtues which Anglicanism so vainly opposed
to Puritanismism His literary beginnings are obscure There exists a
copy of a work _The Loves of Amos and Laura_ written by S P
published in 1613 and again in 1619 The edition of 1619 is dedicated
to Iz Wa

 Thou being cause _it is as now it is_

the Dedication does not occur in the one imperfect known copy of 1613
Conceivably the words as now it is refer to the edition of 1619 which
might have been emended by Waltons advice But there are no
emendations hence it is more probable that Walton revised the poem in
1613 when he was a man of twenty or that he merely advised the author
to publish

 For hadst thou held thy tongue by silence might
 These have been buried in oblivions night

S P also remarks

 No ill thing can be clothed in thy verse

hence Izaak was already a rhymer and a harmless one under the Royal
Prentice gentle King Jamie

By this time Walton was probably settled in London A deed in the
possession of his biographer Dr Johnsons friend Sir John Hawkins
shows that in 1614 Walton held half of a shop on the north side of
Fleet Street two doors west of Chancery Lane the other occupant was a
hosier Mr Nicholl has discovered that Walton was made free of the
Ironmongers Company on Nov 12 1618 He is styled an Ironmonger in his
marriage licence The facts are given in Mr Marstons Life of Walton
prefixed to his edition of _The Compleat Angler_ 1888 It is odd that
a prentice ironmonger should have been a poet and a critic of poetry Dr
Donne before 1614 was Vicar of St Dunstans in the West and in Walton
had a parishioner a disciple and a friend Izaak greatly loved the
society of the clergy he connected himself with Episcopal families and
had a natural taste for a Bishop Through Donne perhaps or it may be
in converse across the counter he made acquaintance with Hales of Eton
Dr King and Sir Henry Wotton himself an angler and one who like
Donne and Izaak loved a ghost story and had several in his family
Drayton the riverpoet author of the _Polyolbion_ is also spoken of by
Walton as my old deceased friend

On Dec 27 1626 Walton married at Canterbury Rachel Floud a niece
on the maternal side by several descents of Cranmer the famous
Archbishop of Canterbury The Cranmers were intimate with the family of
the judicious Hooker and Walton was again connected with kinsfolk of
that celebrated divine Donne died in 1631 leaving to Walton and to
other friends a bloodstone engraved with Christ crucified on an anchor
the seal is impressed on Waltons will When Donnes poems were
published in 1633 Walton added commendatory verses

 As all lament
 Or should this general cause of discontent

The parenthetic or should is much in Waltons manner Witness my mild
pen not used to upbraid the world is also a pleasant and accurate
piece of selfcriticism I am his convert Walton exclaims In a
citation from a manuscript which cannot be found and perhaps never
existed Walton is spoken of as a very sweet poet in his youth and more
than all in matters of love 1 Donne had been in the same case he
or Time may have converted Walton from amorous ditties Walton in an
edition of Donnes poems of 1635 writes of

 This book dry emblem which begins
 With love but ends with tears and sighs for sins

The preacher and his convert had probably a similar history of the heart
as we shall see Walton like the Cyclops had known love Early in
1639 Wotton wrote to Walton about a proposed Life of Donne to be
written by himself and hoped to enjoy your own ever welcome company in
the approaching time of the _Fly_ and the _Cork_ Wotton was a
flyfisher the cork or float or trembling quill marks Izaak for the
bottomfisher he was Wotton died in December 1639 Walton prefixed his
own Life of Donne to that divines sermons in 1640 He says in the
Dedication of the reprint of 1658 that it had the approbation of our
late learned and eloquent King the martyred Charles I Living in or
at the corner of Chancery Lane Walton is known to have held parochial
office he was even elected scavenger He had the misfortune to lose
seven childrenof whom the last died in 1641his wife and his mother
inlaw In 1644 he left Chancery Lane and probably retired from trade
He was of course a Royalist Speaking of the entry of the Scots who
came as one of them said for the goodsand chattels of the English
he remarks I saw and suffered by it 2 He also mentions that he
saw shops shut by their owners till Laud should be put to death in
January 1645 In his Life of Sanderson Walton vouches for an anecdote
of the knowing and conscientious King Charles who he says meant to
do public penance for Straffords death and for the abolishing of
Episcopacy in Scotland But the condition peaceable possession of the
Crown was not granted to Charles nor could have been granted to a
prince who wished to reintroduce Bishops in Scotland Walton had his
information from Dr Morley On Nov 25 1645 Walton probably wrote
though John Marriott signed an Address to the Reader printed in 1646
with Quarless _Shepherds Eclogues_ The piece is a little idyll in
prose and angle lines and flies are not omitted in the description
of the fruitful month of May while Pan is implored to restore Arcadian
peace to Britannia and grant that each honest shepherd may again sit
under his own vine and figtree and feed his own flock when the King
comes no doubt About 1646 Walton married Anne halfsister of Bishop
Ken a lady of much Christian meeknesse Sir Harris Nicolas thinks
that he only visited Stafford occasionally in these troubled years He
mentions fishing in Shawford brook he was likely to fish wherever
there was water and the brook flowed through land which as Mr Marston
shows he acquired about 1656 In 1650 a child was born to Walton in
Clerkenwell it died but another Isaac was born in September 1651 In
1651 he published the _Reliquiae Wottonianae_ with a Memoir of Sir Henry
Wotton The knight had valued Waltons company as a cure for those
splenetic vapours that are called hypochondriacal

Worcester fight was on September 3 1651 the king was defeated and
fled escaping thanks to a stand made by Wogan and to the loyalty of
Mistress Jane Lane and of many other faithful adherents A jewel of
Charless the lesser George was preserved by Colonel Blague who
intrusted it to Mr Barlow of Blore Pipe House in Staffordshire Mr
Barlow gave it to Mr Milward a Royalist prisoner in Stafford and he
in turn intrusted it to Walton who managed to convey it to Colonel
Blague in the Tower The colonel escaped and the George was given back
to the king Ashmole who tells the story mentions Walton as well
beloved of all good men This incident is perhaps the only known
adventure in the long life of old Izaak The peaceful angler with a
royal jewel in his pocket must have encountered many dangers on the
highway He was a man of sixty when he published his _Compleat Angler_
in 1653 and so secured immortality The quiet beauties of his manner in
his various biographies would only have made him known to a few students
who could never have recognised Byrons quaint old cruel coxcomb in
their author The whole discourse is a kind of picture of my own
disposition at least of my disposition in such days and times as I allow
myself when honest Nat and R R and I go afishing together Izaak
speaks of the possibility that his book may reach a second edition There
are now editions more than a hundred Waltonians should read Mr Thomas
Westwoods Preface to his _Chronicle of the Compleat Angler_ it is
reprinted in Mr Marstons edition Mr Westwood learned to admire
Walton at the feet of Charles Lamb

 No fisher
 But a wellwisher
 To the game

as Scott describes himself 3

Lamb recommended Walton to Coleridge it breathes the very spirit of
innocence purity and simplicity of heart    it would sweeten a
mans temper at any time to read it it would Christianise every angry
discordant passion pray make yourself acquainted with it Oct 28
1796 According to Mr Westwood Lamb had an early copy found in a
repository of marine stores but not even then to be bought a bargain
Mr Westwood fears that Lambs copy was only Hawkinss edition of 1760
The original is extremely scarce Mr Locker had a fine copy there is
another in the library of Dorchester House both are in their primitive
livery of brown sheep or calf The book is one which only the wealthy
collector can hope with luck to call his own A small octavo sold at
eighteenpence _The Compleat Angler_ was certain to be thumbed into
nothingness after enduring much from May showers July suns and fishy
companionship It is almost a wonder that any examples of Waltons and
Bunyans first editions have survived into our day The little volume
was meant to find a place in the bulging pockets of anglers and was well
adapted to that end The work should be reprinted in a similar format
quarto editions are out of place

The fortunes of the book the _fata libelli_ have been traced by Mr
Westwood There are several misprints later corrected in the earliest
copies as p 88 Fordig for Fordidg p 152 Pudoch for
Pudock The appearance of the work was advertised in _The Perfect
Diurnal_ May 916 and in No 154 of _The Mercurius Politicus_ May 19
26 also in an almanack for 1654 Izaak or his publisher Marriott
cunningly brought out the book at a season when men expect the Mayfly
Just a month before Oliver Cromwell had walked into the House of
Commons in a plain suit of black clothes with grey stockings His
language when he spoke was reckoned unparliamentary as it undeniably
was and he dissolved the Long Parliament While Marriott was
advertising Waltons work Cromwell was making a Parliament of Saints
faithful fearing God and hating covetousness This is a good
description of Izaak but he was not selected In the midst of
revolutions came _The Compleat Angler_ to the light a possession for
ever Its original purchasers are not likely to have taken a hand in
Royalist plots or saintly conventicles They were peaceful men A
certain Cromwellian trooper Richard Franck was a better angler than
Walton and he has left to us the only contemporary and contemptuous
criticism of his book to this we shall return but anglers as a rule
unlike Franck must have been for the king and on Izaaks side in
controversy

Walton brought out a second edition in 1655 He rewrote the book adding
more than a third suppressing _Viator_ and introducing _Venator_ New
plates were added and after the manner of the time commendatory
verses A third edition appeared in 1661 a fourth published by Simon
Gape not by Marriott came out in 1664 a fifth in 1668 counting Gapes
of 1664 as a new edition and in 1676 the work with treatises by
Venables and Charles Cotton was given to the world as _The Universal
Angler_ Five editions in twelve years is not bad evidence of Waltons
popularity But times now altered Walton is really an Elizabethan he
has the quaint freshness the apparently artless music of language of the
great age He is a friend of country contents no lover of the town
no keen student of urban ways and mundane men A new taste modelled on
that of the wits of Louis XIV had come in we are in the period of
Dryden and approaching that of Pope

There was no new edition of Walton till Moses Browne by Johnsons
desire published him with improvements in 1750 Then came Hawkinss
edition in 1760 Johnson said of Hawkins Why maam I believe him to
be an honest man at the bottom but to be sure he is penurious and he
is mean and it must be owned he has a degree of brutality and a
tendency to savageness that cannot easily be defended

This was hardly the editor for Izaak However Hawkins probably by aid
of Oldys the antiquary as Mr Marston shows laid a good foundation for
a biography of Walton Errors he made but Sir Harris Nicolas has
corrected them Johnson himself reckoned Waltons _Lives_ as one of his
most favourite books He preferred the life of Donne and justly
complained that Waltons story of Donnes vision of his absent wife had
been left out of a modern edition He explained Waltons friendship with
persons of higher rank by his being a great panegyrist

The eighteenth century we see came back to Walton as the nineteenth
has done He was precisely the author to suit Charles Lamb He was
reprinted again and again and illustrated by Stoddart and others Among
his best editors are Major 1839 Ephemera 1853 Nicolas 1836
1860 and Mr Marston 1888

The only contemporary criticism known to me is that of Richard Franck
who had served with Cromwell in Scotland and not liking the aspect of
changing times returned to the north and fished from the Esk to
Strathnaver In 1658 he wrote his _Northern Memoirs_ an itinerary of
sport heavily cumbered by dull reflections and pedantic style Franck
however was a practical angler especially for salmon a fish of which
Walton knew nothing he also appreciated the character of the great
Montrose He went to America wrote a wild cosmogonic work and _The
Admirable and Indefatigable Adventures of the Nine Pious Pilgrims_ one
pilgrim catches a trout London 1708 The _Northern Memoirs_ of 1658
were not published till 1694 Sir Walter Scott edited a new issue in
1821 and defended Izaak from the strictures of the salmonfisher Izaak
says Franck lays the stress of his arguments upon other mens
observations wherewith he stuffs his indigested octavo so brings
himself under the anglers censure and the common calamity of a plagiary
to be pitied poor man for his loss of time in scribbling and
transcribing other mens notions    I remember in Stafford I urged
his own argument upon him that pickerel weed of itself breeds pickerel
pike Franck proposed a rational theory which my Compleat Angler no
sooner deliberated but dropped his argument and leaves Gesner to defend
it so huffed away     So note the true character of an
industrious angler more deservedly falls upon Merrill and Faulkner or
rather Izaak Ouldham a man that fished salmon with but three hairs at
hook whose collections and experiments were lost with himselfa
matter much to be regretted It will be observed of course that hair
was then used and gut is first mentioned for angling purposes by Mr
Pepys Indeed the flies which Scott was hunting for when he found the
lost Ms of the first part of _Waverley_ are tied on horsehairs They
are in the possession of the descendants of Scotts friend Mr William
Laidlaw The curious angler consulting Franck will find that his
salmon flies are much like our own but less variegated Scott justly
remarks that while Walton was habit and repute a baitfisher even
Cotton knows nothing of salmon Scott wished that Walton had made the
northern tour but Izaak would have been sadly to seek running after a
fish down a gorge of the Shin or the Brora and the discomforts of the
north would have finished his career In Scotland he would not have
found fresh sheets smelling of lavender

Walton was in London in the dangerous year 1655 He speaks of his
meeting Bishop Sanderson there in sadcoloured clothes and God knows
far from being costly The friends were driven by wind and rain into a
cleanly house where we had bread cheese ale and a fire for our ready
money The rain and wind were so obliging to me as to force our stay
there for at least an hour to my great content and advantage for in
that time he made to me many useful observations of the present times
with much clearness and conscientious freedom It was a year of
Republican and Royalist conspiracies the clergy were persecuted and
banished from London

No more is known of Walton till the happy year 1660 when the king came
to his own again and Waltons Episcopal friends to their palaces Izaak
produced an Eglog on May 29

 The king The kings returned And now
 Lets banish all sad thoughts and sing
 We have our laws and have our king

If Izaak was so eccentric as to go to bed sober on that glorious twenty
ninth of May I greatly misjudge him But he grew elderly In 1661 he
chronicles the deaths of honest Nat and R Roethey are gone and
with them most of my pleasant hours even as a shadow that passeth away
and returns not On April 17 1662 Walton lost his second wife she
died at Worcester probably on a visit to Bishop Morley In the same
year the bishop was translated to Winchester where the palace became
Izaaks home The Itchen where no doubt he angled with worm must
have been his constant haunt He was busy with his Life of Richard
Hooker 1665 The peroration as it were was altered and expanded in
1670 and this is but one example of Waltons care of his periods One
beautiful passage he is known to have rewritten several times till his
ear was satisfied with its cadences In 1670 he published his Life of
George Herbert I wish if God shall be so pleased that I may be so
happy as to die like him In 1673 in a Dedication of the third edition
of _Reliquiae Wottonianae_ Walton alludes to his friendship with a much
younger and gayer man than himself Charles Cotton born 1630 the
friend of Colonel Richard Lovelace and of Sir John Suckling the
translator of Scarrons travesty of Virgil and of Montaignes _Essays_
Cotton was a roisterer a man at one time deep in debt but he was a
Royalist a scholar and an angler The friendship between him and
Walton is creditable to the freshness of the old man and to the kindness
of the younger who to be sure laughed at Izaaks heavily dubbed London
flies In him says Cotton I have the happiness to know the
worthiest man and to enjoy the best and the truest friend any man ever
had We are reminded of Johnson with Langton and Topham Beauclerk
Meanwhile Izaak the younger had grown up was educated under Dr Fell at
Christ Church and made the Grand Tour in 1675 visiting Rome and Venice
In March 1676 he proceeded MA and took Holy Orders In this year
Cotton wrote his treatise on flyfishing to be published with Waltons
new edition and the famous fishing house on the Dove with the blended
initials of the two friends was built In 1678 Walton wrote his Life
of Sanderson    Tis now too late to wish that my life may be like
his for I am in the eightyfifth year of my age but I humbly beseech
Almighty God that my death may be and do as earnestly beg of every
reader to say Amen He wrote in 1678 a preface to _Thealma and
Clearchus_ 1683 The poem is attributed to John Chalkhill a Fellow of
Winchester College who died a man of eighty in 1679 Two of his songs
are in _The Compleat Angler_ Probably the attribution is right
Chalkhills tomb commemorates a man after Waltons own heart but some
have assigned the volume to Walton himself Chalkhill is described on
the titlepage as an acquaintant and friend of Edmund Spencer which
is impossible 4

On August 9 1683 Walton wrote his will in the neintyeth year of my
age and in perfect memory for which praised be God He professes the
Anglican faith despite a very long and very trew friendship for some of
the Roman Church His worldly estate he has acquired neither by
falsehood or flattery or the extreme crewelty of the law of this nation
His property was in two houses in London the lease of Norington farm a
farm near Stafford besides books linen and a hanging cabinet inscribed
with his name now it seems in the possession of Mr Elkin Mathews A
bequest is made of money for coals to the poor of Stafford every last
weike in Janewary or in every first weike in Febrewary I say then
because I take that time to be the hardest and most pinching times with
pore people To the Bishop of Winchester he bequeathed a ring with the
posy A Mite for a Million There are other bequests including ten
pounds to my old friend Mr Richard Marriott Waltons bookseller
This good man died in peace with his publisher leaving him also a ring
A ring was left to a lady of the Portsmouth family Mrs Doro Wallop

Walton died at the house of his soninlaw Dr Hawkins in Winchester
on Dec 15 1683 he is buried in the south aisle of the Cathedral The
Cathedral library possesses many of Waltons books with his name written
in them 5 His _Eusebius_ 1636 contains on the flyleaf
repetitions in various forms of one of his studied passages Simple as
he seems he is a careful artist in language

Such are the scanty records and scantier relics of a very long life
Circumstances and inclination combined to make Walpole choose the
_fallentis semita vitae_ Without ambition save to be in the society of
good men he passed through turmoil ever companioned by content For
him existence had its trials he saw all that he held most sacred
overthrown laws broken up his king publicly murdered his friends
outcasts his worship proscribed he himself suffered in property from
the raid of the Kirk into England He underwent many bereavements child
after child he lost but content he did not lose nor sweetness of heart
nor belief His was one of those happy characters which are never found
disassociated from unquestioning faith Of old he might have been the
ancient religious Athenian in the opening of Platos _Republic_ or
Virgils aged gardener The happiness of such natures would be
incomplete without religion but only by such tranquil and blessed souls
can religion be accepted with no doubt or scruple no dread and no
misgiving In his Preface to _Thealma and Clearchus_ Walton writes and
we may use his own words about his own works The Reader will here find
such various events and rewards of innocent Truth and undissembled
Honesty as is like to leave in him if he be a goodnatured reader more
sympathising and virtuous impressions than ten times so much time spent
in impertinent critical and needless disputes about religion Walton
relied on authority on a plain unperplexed catechism In an age of
the strangest and most dissident theological speculations an age of
Quakers Anabaptists Antinomians Fifth Monarchy Men Covenanters
Independents Gibbites Presbyterians and what not Walton was true to
the authority of the Church of England with no prejudice against the
ancient Catholic faith As Gesner was his authority for pickerel weed
begetting pike so the Anglican bishops were security for Waltons creed

To him if we may say so it was easy to be saved while Bunyan a
greater humorist could be saved only in following a path that skirted
madness and as by fire To Bunyan Walton would have seemed a figure
like his own Ignorance a pilgrim who never stuck in the Slough of
Despond nor met Apollyon in the Valley of the Shadow nor was captive in
Doubting Castle nor stoned in Vanity Fair And of Bunyan Walton would
have said that he was among those Nonconformists who might be sincere
wellmeaning men whose indiscreet zeal might be so like charity as
thereby to cover a multitude of errors To Walton there seemed
spiritual solace in remembering that we have comforted and been helpful
to a dejected or distressed family Bunyan would have regarded this
belief as a heresy and theoretically charitable deeds as filthy
rags Differently constituted these excellent men accepted religion in
different ways Christian bows beneath a burden of sin Piscator beneath
a basket of trout Let us be grateful for the diversities of human
nature and the dissimilar paths which lead Piscator and Christian alike
to the City not built with hands Both were seekers for a City which to
have sought through life in patience honesty loyalty and love is to
have found it Of Waltons book we may say

 Laudis amore tumes Sunt certa piacula quae te
 Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello




WALTON AS A BIOGRAPHER


It was probably by his _Lives_ rather than in the first instance by
his _Angler_ that Walton won the liking of Dr Johnson whence came his
literary resurrection It is true that Moses Browne and Hawkins both
friends of Johnsons edited _The Compleat Angler_ before 17751776 when
we find Dr Home of Magdalene Oxford contemplating a benoted edition
of the _Lives_ by Johnsons advice But the Walton of the _Lives_ is
rather than the Walton of the _Angler_ the man after Johnsons own
heart The _Angler_ is a picture of my own disposition on holidays
The _Lives_ display the same disposition in serious moods and in face of
the eternal problems of mans life in society Johnson we know was
very fond of biography had thought much on the subject and as Boswell
notes varied from himself in talk when he discussed the measure of
truth permitted to biographers If a man is to write a _Panegyrick_ he
may keep vices out of sight but if he professes to write a _Life_ he
must represent it as it really was Peculiarities were not to be
concealed he said and his own were not veiled by Boswell Nobody can
write the life of a man but those who have eat and drunk and lived in
social intercourse with him They only who live with a man can write
his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination and few people
who have lived with a man know what to remark about him Walton had
lived much in the society of his subjects Donne and Wotton with
Sanderson he had a slighter acquaintance George Herbert he had only met
Hooker of course he had never seen in the flesh It is obvious to
every reader that his biographies of Donne and Wotton are his best In
Donnes Life he feels that he is writing of an English St Austinfor
I think none was so like him before his conversion none so like St
Ambrose after it and if his youth had the infirmities of the one his
age had the excellencies of the other the learning and holiness of
both

St Augustine made free confession of his own infirmities of youth With
great delicacy Walton lets Donne also confess himself printing a letter
in which he declines to take Holy Orders because his course of life when
very young had been too notorious Delicacy and tact are as notable in
Waltons account of Donnes poverty melancholy and conversion through
the blessed means of gentle King Jamie Walton had an awful loyalty a
sincere reverence for the office of a king But wherever he introduces
King James either in his Donne or his Wotton you see a subdued version
of the King James of _The Fortunes of Nigel_ The pedantry the good
nature the touchiness the humour the nervousness are all here It
only needs a touch of the kings broad accent to set before us as
vividly as in Scott the interviews with Donne and that singular scene
when Wotton disguised as Octavio Baldi deposits his long rapier at the
door of his majestys chamber Wotton in Florence was warned of a plot
to murder James VI The duke gave him such Italian antidotes against
poison as the Scots till then had been strangers to indeed there is no
antidote for a dirk and the Scots were not poisoners Introduced by
Lindsay as Octavio Baldi Wotton found his nervous majesty accompanied
by four Scottish nobles He spoke in Italian then drawing near
hastily whispered that he was an Englishman and prayed for a private
interview This by some art he obtained delivered his antidotes and
when James succeeded Elizabeth rose to high favour Izaaks suppressed
humour makes it plain that Wotton had acted the scene for him from the
moment of leaving the long rapier at the door Again telling how
Wotton in his peaceful hours as Provost of Eton intended to write a
Life of Luther he says that King Charles diverted him from his purpose
to attempting a History of England by a persuasive loving violence to
which may be added a promise of 500 pounds a year He likes these
parenthetic touches as in his description of Donne always preaching to
himself like an angel from a cloud_but in none_ Again of a
commendation of one of his heroes he says it is a known truththough
it be in verse

A memory of the days when Izaak was an amorist and shone in love
ditties appears thus He is speaking of Donne

 Love is a flattering mischief    a passion that carries us to
 commit errors with as much ease as whirlwinds remove feathers

 The tears of lovers or beauty dressed in sadness are observed to
 have in them a charming sadness and to become very often too strong
 to be resisted

These are examples of Waltons sympathy his power of portraitdrawing is
especially attested by his study of Donne as the young gallant and poet
the unhappy lover the man of state out of place and neglected the
heavily burdened father the conscientious scholar the charming yet
ascetic preacher and divine the saint who dying makes himself in his
own shroud an emblem of mortality

As an example of Waltons style take the famous vision of Dr Donne in
Paris He had left his wife expecting her confinement

 Two days after their arrival there Mr Donne was left alone in that
 room in which Sir Robert and he and some other friends had dined
 together To this place Sir Robert returned within half an hour and
 as he left so he found Mr Donne alone but in such an ecstacy and
 so altered as to his looks as amazed Sir Robert to behold him
 insomuch that he earnestly desired Mr Donne to declare what had
 befallen him in the short time of his absence To which Mr Donne was
 not able to make a present answer but after a long and perplexed
 pause did at last say I have seen a dreadful vision since I saw
 you I have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room with
 her hair hanging about her shoulders and a dead child in her arms
 this I have seen since I saw you To which Sir Robert replied
 Sure sir you have slept since I saw you and this is the result of
 some melancholy dream which I desire you to forget for you are now
 awake To which Mr Donnes reply was I cannot be surer that I now
 live than that I have not slept since I saw you and I am as sure that
 at her second appearing she stopped and looked me in the face and
 vanished     And upon examination the abortion proved to be the
 same day and about the very hour that Mr Donne affirmed he saw her
 pass by him in his chamber

     And though it is most certain that two lutes being both
 strung and tuned to an equal pitch and then one played upon the
 other that is not touched being laid upon a table at a fit distance
 will like an echo to a trumpet warble a faint audible harmony in
 answer to the same tune yet many will not believe there is any such
 thing as a sympathy of souls and I am well pleased that every reader
 do enjoy his own opinion    

He then appeals to authority as of Brutus St Monica Saul St Peter

 More observations of this nature and inferences from them might be
 made to gain the relation a firmer belief but I forbear lest I that
 intended to be but a relator may be thought to be an engaged person
 for the proving what was related to me    by one who had it from
 Dr Donne

Walpole was no Boswell worthy Boswell would have crossexamined Dr
Donne himself

Of dreams he writes

 Common dreams are but a senseless paraphrase on our waking thoughts
 or of the business of the day past or are the result of our over
 engaged affections when we betake ourselves to rest    Yet
 Almighty God though the causes of dreams be often unknown hath even
 in these latter times also by a certain illumination of the soul in
 sleep discovered many things that human wisdom could not foresee

Walton is often charged with superstition and the enlightened editor of
the eighteenth century excised all the scene of Mrs Donnes wraith as
too absurd But Walton is a very fair witness Donne a man of
imagination was he tells us in a perturbed anxiety about Mrs Donne
The event was after dinner The story is by Waltons admission at
second hand Thus in the language of the learned in such matters the
tale is not evidential Walton explains it if true as a result of
sympathy of soulswhat is now called telepathy But he is content
that every man should have his own opinion In the same way he writes of
the seers in the Wotton family God did seem to speak to many of this
family the Wottons in dreams and Thomas Wottons dreams did
usually prove true both in foretelling things to come and discovering
things past Thus he dreamed that five townsmen and poor scholars were
robbing the University chest at Oxford He mentioned this in a letter to
his son at Oxford and the letter arriving just after the robbery led
to the discovery of the culprits Yet Walton states the causes and
nature of dreams in general with perfect sobriety and clearness His
tales of this sort were much to Johnsons mind as to Southeys But
Walton cannot fairly be called superstitious granting the age in which
he lived Visions like Dr Donnes still excite curious comment

To that cruel superstition of his age witchcraft I think there is no
allusion in Walton Almost as uncanny however is his account of
Donnes preparation for death

 Several charcoal fires being first made in his large study he
 brought with him into that place his windingsheet in his hand and
 having put off all his clothes had this sheet put on him and so tied
 with knots at his head and feet and his hands so placed as dead
 bodies are usually fitted to be shrouded and put into their coffin or
 grave Upon this urn he thus stood with his eyes shut and with so
 much of the sheet turned aside as might show his lean pale and death
 like face which was purposely turned towards the east from which he
 expected the second coming of his and our Saviour Jesus In this
 posture he was drawn at his just height and when the picture was
 fully finished he caused it to be set by his bedside where it
 continued and became his hourly object till death

Thus Donne made ready to meet the common fate

 That body which once was a temple of the Holy Ghost is now become a
 small quantity of Christian ashes But I shall see it reanimated

This is the very voice of Faith Walton was indeed an assured
believer and to his mind the world offered no insoluble problem But
we may say of him in the words of a poet whom he quotes

 Many a one
 Owes to his country his religion
 And in another would as strongly grow
 Had but his nurse or mother taught him so

In his account of Donnes early theological studies of the differences
between Rome and Anglicanism it is manifest that Izaak thinks these
differences matters of no great moment They are not for simple men to
solve Donne has taken that trouble for him besides he is an
Englishman and

 Owes to his country his religion

He will be no Covenanter and writes with disgust of an intruded Scots
minister whose first action was to cut down the ancient yews in the
churchyard Izaaks religion and all his life were rooted in the past
like the yewtree He is what he calls the passive peaceable
Protestant The common people in this nation he writes think they
are not wise unless they be busy about what they understand not and
especially about religion as Bunyan was busy at that very moment In
Waltons opinion the plain facts of religion and of consequent
morality are visible as the sun at noonday The vexed questions are for
the learned and are solved variously by them A man must follow
authority as he finds it established in his own country unless he has
the learning and genius of a Donne To these or equivalents for these
in a special privy inspiration the common people of his day and ever
since Elizabeths day were pretending This was the inevitable result
of the translation of the Bible into English Walton quotes with
approval a remark of a witty Italian on a populace which was universally
occupied with Freewill and Predestination The fruits Walton saw in
preaching Corporals Antinomian Trusty Tompkinses Quakers who ran about
naked barking Presbyterians who cut down old yewtrees and a
Parliament of Saints Walton took no kind of joy in the general
emancipation of the human spirit The clergy he confessed were not
what he wished them to be but they were better than Quakers naked and
ululant To love God and his neighbour and to honour the king was
Waltons unperplexed religion Happily he was saved from the view of the
errors and the fall of James II a king whom it was not easy to honour
His social philosophy was one of established rank tempered by equity and
Christian charity If anything moves his tranquil spirit it is the
remorseless greed of him who takes his fellowservant by the throat and
exacts the uttermost penny How Sanderson saved a poor farmer from the
greed of an extortionate landlord Walton tells in his Life of the
prelate adding this reflection

 It may be noted that in this age there are a sort of people so unlike
 the God of mercy so void of the bowels of pity that they love only
 themselves and their children love them so as not to be concerned
 whether the rest of mankind waste their days in sorrow or shame
 people that are cursed with riches and a mistake that nothing but
 riches can make them and theirs happy

Thus Walton appears this is the picture of his own disposition in the
_Lives_ He is a kind of antithesis to John Knox Men like Walton are
not to be approached for new ideas They will never make a new world
at a blow they will never enable us to understand but they can teach us
to endure and even to enjoy the world Their example is alluring

 Even the ashes of the just
 Smell sweet and blossom in the dust




THE COMPLEAT ANGLER


Franck as we saw called Walton a plagiary He was a plagiary in the
same sense as Virgil and Lord Tennyson and Robert Burns and indeed
Homer and all poets _The Compleat Angler_ the father of so many
books is the child of a few Walton not only adopts the opinions and
advice of the authors whom he cites but also follows the manner to a
certain extent of authors whom he does not quote His very exordium
his keynote echoes as Sir Harris Nicolas observes the opening of _A
Treatise of the Nature of God_ London 1599 The _Treatise_ starts
with a conversation between a gentleman and a scholar it commences

 _Gent_ Well overtaken sir

 _Scholar_ You are welcome gentleman

A more important source is _The Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle_
commonly attributed to Dame Juliana Barnes printed at Westminster
1496 A manuscript probably of 14301450 has been published by Mr
Satchell London 1883 This book may be a translation of an unknown
French original It opens

 Soloman in hys paraboles seith that a glad spirit maket a flowryng
 age That ys to sey a feyre age and a longe like Waltons own
 and sith hyt ys so I aske this question wyche bynne the menys and
 cause to reduce a man to a mery spryte The angler schall have hys
 holsom walke and mery at hys owne ease and also many a sweyt eayr of
 divers erbis and flowres that schall make hym ryght hongre and well
 disposed in hys body He schall heyr the melodies melodious of the
 ermony of byrde he schall se also the yong swannes and signetes
 folowing ther eyrours duckes cootes herons and many other fowlys
 with ther brodys wyche me semyt better then all the noyse of houndes
 and blastes of hornes and other gamys that fawkners or hunters can
 make and yf the angler take the fyssche hardly then ys ther no man
 meryer then he in his sprites

This is the very sprite of Walton this has that vernal and matutinal
air of opening European literature full of birds music and redolent of
dawn This is the note to which the age following Walton would not
listen

In matter of fact again Izaak follows the ancient _Treatise_ We know
his jury of twelve flies the _Treatise_ says

 These ben the xij flyes wyth whyche ye shall angle to the trought and
 graylling and dubbe like as ye shall now here me tell

 _Marche_ The donne fly the body of the donne woll and the wyngis
 of the pertryche Another donne flye the body of blacke woll the
 wyngis of the blackyst drake and the lay under the wynge and under
 the tayle

Walton has

 The first is the dun fly in March the body is made of dun wool the
 wings of the partridges feathers The second is another dun fly the
 body of black wool and the wings made of the black drakes feathers
 and of the feathers under his tail

Again the _Treatise_ has

 _Auguste_ The drake fly The body of black wull and lappyd abowte
 wyth blacke sylke winges of the mayle of the blacke drake wyth a
 blacke heed

Walton has

 The twelfth is the dark drakefly good in August the body made with
 black wool lapt about with black silk his wings are made with the
 mail of the black drake with a black head

This is word for word a transcript of the fifteenth century _Treatise_
But Izaak cites not the ancient _Treatise_ but Mr Thomas Barker 6
Barker in fact gives many more and more variegated flies than Izaak
offers in the jury of twelve which he rendered from the old _Treatise_
into modern English Sir Harris Nicolas says that the jury is from
Leonard Mascalls _Booke of Fishing with Hooke and Line_ London 1609
but Mascall merely stole from the fifteenthcentury book In Cottons
practice and that of _The Anglers Vade Mecum_ 1681 flies were as
numerous as among ourselves and had in many cases the same names
Walton absurdly bids us let no part of the line touch the water but the
fly only Barker says Let the fly light first into the water Both
men insist on fishing down stream which is of course the opposite of
the true art for fish lie with their heads up stream and trout are best
approached from behind Cotton admits of fishing both up and down as
the wind and stream may serve and of course in heavy water in
Scotland this is all very well But none of the old anglers to my
knowledge was a dryfly fisher and Izaak was no flyfisher at all He
took what he said from Mascall who took it from the old _Treatise_ in
which it is probable Walton read and followed the pleasant and to him
congenial spirit of the mediaeval angler All these writers tooled with
huge rods fifteen or eighteen feet in length and Izaak had apparently
never used a reel For salmon he says some use a wheel about the
middle of their rods or near their hand which is to be observed better
by seeing one of them than by a large demonstration of words

Mr Westwood has made a catalogue of books cited by Walton in his
_Compleat Angler_ There is AElian who makes the first known reference
to flyfishing Aldrovandus _De Piscibus_ 1638 Dubravius _De
Piscibus_ 1559 and the English translation 1599 Gerards _Herball_
1633 Gesner _De Piscibus_ _sa_ and _Historia Naturalis_ 1558
Phil Hollands _Pliny_ 1601 Rondelet _De Piscibus Marines_ 1554
Silvianus _Aquatilium Historiae_ 1554 these nearly exhaust Waltons
supply of authorities in natural history He was devoted as we saw to
authority and had a childlike faith in the fantastic theories which date
from Pliny Pliny hath an opinion that many flies have their birth or
being from a dew that in the spring falls upon the leaves of trees It
is a pious opinion Izaak is hardly so superstitious as the author of
_The Anglers Vade Mecum_ I cannot imagine him taking Mans fat and
cats fat of each half an ounce mummy finely powdered three drains
and a number of other abominations to make an Oyntment according to
Art and when you Angle anoint 8 inches of the line next the Hook
therewith Or Take the Bones and Scull of a Deadman at the opening
of a Grave and beat the same into Pouder and put of this Pouder in the
Moss wherein you keep your Worms_but others like Grave Earth as
well_ No doubt grave earth is quite as efficacious

These remarks show how Izaak was equipped in books and in practical
information it follows that his book is to be read not for instruction
but for human pleasure

So much for what Walton owed to others For all the rest for what has
made him the favourite of schoolboys and sages of poets and
philosophers he is indebted to none but his Maker and his genius That
he was a lover of Montaigne we know and had Montaigne been a fisher he
might have written somewhat like Izaak but without the piety the
perfume and the charm There are authors whose living voices if we
know them in the flesh we seem to hear in our ears as we peruse their
works Of such was Mr Jowett sometime Master of Balliol College a
good man now with God It has ever seemed to me that friends of Walton
must thus have heard his voice as they read him and that it reaches us
too though faintly Indeed we have here a kind of picture of his own
disposition as he tells us Piscator is the Walton whom honest Nat and
R Roe and Sir Henry Wotton knew on fishingdays The book is a set of
confessions without their commonly morbid turn I write not for money
but for pleasure he says methinks he drove no hard bargain with good
Richard Marriott nor was careful and troubled about royalties on his
eighteenpenny book He regards scoffers as an abomination to mankind
for indeed even Dr Johnson who a century later set Moses Browne on
reprinting _The Compleat Angler_ broke his jest on our suffering tribe
Many grave serious men pity anglers says Auceps and Venator styles
them patient men as surely they have great need to be For our toil
like that of the husbandman hangs on the weather that Heaven sends and
on the flies that have their birth or being from a kind of dew and on
the inscrutable caprice of fish also in England on the miller who
giveth or withholdeth at his pleasure the very water that is our element
The inquiring rustic who shambles up erect when we are lying low among
the reeds even he disposes of our fortunes with whom as with all men
we must be patient dwelling ever

 With closelipped Patience for our only friend
 Sad Patience too near neighbour of Despair

O the tangles more than Gordian of gut on a windy day O bitter east
wind that bloweth down stream O the young ducks that swimming between
us and the trout contend with him for the blue duns in their season O
the hay grass behind us that entangles the hook O the rocky wall that
breaks it the boughs that catch it the drought that leaves the salmon
stream dry the floods that fill it with turbid impossible waters Alas
for the knot that breaks and for the iron that bends for the lost
landingnet and the gillie with the gaff that scrapes the fish Izaak
believed that fish could hear if they can their vocabulary must be full
of strange oaths for all anglers are not patient men A malison on the
trout that bulge and tail on the salmon that jiggers or sulks or
lightly gambols over and under the line These things and many more we
anglers endure meekly being patient men and a light world fleers at us
for our very virtue

Izaak of course justifies us by the example of the primitive
Christians and in the manner of the age drowns opposition in a flood
of erudition out of place but never pedantic futile yet diverting
erroneous but not dull

God is said to have spoken to a fish but never to a beast There is a
modern Greek phrase By the first word of God and the second of the
fish As for angling it is somewhat like poetry men are to be born
so and many are born to be both rhymers and anglers But unlike many
poets the angler resembles the Adonis or Darling of the Sea so called
because it is a loving and innocent fish and a peaceful and truly I
think most anglers are so disposed to most of mankind

Our Saviours peculiar affection for fishermen is of course a powerful
argument And it is certain that Peter James and John made converts
among the twelve for the greater number of them were found together
fishing by Jesus after His Resurrection That Amos was a
goodnatured plain fisherman only Walton had faith enough to believe
He fixes gladly on mentions of hooks in the Bible omitting Homer and
that excellent Theocritean dialogue of the two old anglers and the fish
of gold which would have delighted Izaak had he known it but he was no
great scholar And let me tell you that in the Scripture angling is
always taken in the best sense though Izaak does not dwell on Tobiass
enormous capture So he ends with commendations of angling by Wotton
and Davors Dennys more probably author of _The Secrets of Angling_
1613 To these we may add Wordsworth Thomson Scott Hogg Stoddart
and many minor poets who loved the music of the reel

Izaak next illustrates his idea of becoming mirth which excludes
Scripture jests and lascivious jests both of them highly distasteful
to anglers Then he comes to practice beginning with chub for which I
have never angled but have taken them by misadventure with a salmon
fly Thence we proceed to trout and to the charming scene of the
milkmaid and her songs by Raleigh and Marlowe I think much better than
the strong lines that are now in fashion in this critical age for
Walton we have said was the last of the Elizabethans and the new times
were all for Waller and Dryden Chevy Chace and Johnny Armstrong
were dear to Walton as to Scott but through a century these old
favourites were to be neglected save by Mr Pepys and Addison Indeed
there is no more curious proof of the great unhappy change then coming to
make poetry a mechanic art than the circumstance that Walton is much
nearer to us in his likings than to the men between 1670 and 1770 Gay
was to sing of angling but in the strong lines that are now in
fashion All this while Piscator has been angling with worm and minnow
to no purpose though he picks up a trout will fill six reasonable
bellies in the evening So we leave them after their ale in fresh
sheets that smell of lavender Izaaks practical advice is not of much
worth we read him rather for sentences like this Ill tell you
scholar when I sat last on this primrose bank and looked down these
meadows I thought of them as Charles the Emperor did of the city of
Florence that they were too pleasant to be looked upon but only on
holydays He did not say like Fox when Burke spoke of a seat under
a tree with a friend a bottle and a book Why a book Izaak took
his book with hima practice in which at least I am fain to imitate
this excellent old man

As to salmon Walton scarcely speaks a true word about their habits
except by accident Concerning pike he quotes the theory that they are
bred by pickerel weed only as what some think In describing the use
of frogs as bait he makes the famous or infamous remark Use him as
though you loved him    that he may live the longer A baitfisher
_may_ be a good man as Izaak was but it is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle As coarse fish are usually caught only with
bait I shall not follow Izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground
wherein none the less grow flowers of Waltons fancy and the songs of
the old poets are heard _The Practical Angler_ indeed is a book to be
marked with flowers marsh marigolds and fritillaries and petals of the
yellow iris for the whole provokes us to content and whispers that word
of the apostle Study to be quiet




FISHING THEN AND NOW


Since Maui the Maori hero invented barbs for hooks angling has been
essentially one and the same thing South Sea islanders spin for fish
with a motherofpearl lure which is also a hook and answers to our
spoon We have hooks of stone and hooks of bone and a bronze hook
found in Ireland has the familiar Limerick bend What Homer meant by
making anglers throw the horn of an ox of the stall into the sea we
can only guess perhaps a horn minnow is meant or a little sheath of
horn to protect the line Dead bait live bait and imitations of bait
have all been employed and AElian mentions artificial Mayflies used
with a very short line by the Illyrians

But while the same in essence angling has been improved by human
ingenuity The Waltonian angler and still more his English
predecessors dealt much in the homemade The _Treatise_ of the
fifteenth century bids you make your Rodde of a fair staff even of a
six foot long or more as ye list of hazel willow or aspe ash
and beke hym in an ovyn when ye bake and let him cool and dry a four
weeks or more The pith is taken out of him with a hot iron and a yard
of white hazel is similarly treated also a fair shoot of blackthorn or
crabtree for a top The butt is bound with hoops of iron the top is
accommodated with a noose a hair line is looped in the noose and the
angler is equipped Splicing is not used but the joints have holes to
receive each other and with this instrument ye may walk and there is
no man shall wit whereabout ye go Recipes are given for colouring and
plaiting hair lines and directions for forging hooks The smallest
quarell needles are used for the tiniest hooks

Barker 1651 makes the rod of a hasel of one piece or of two pieces
set together in the most convenient manner light and gentle He
recommends the use of a single hair next the flyyou shall have more
rises which is true and kill more fish which is not so likely The
most delicate striking is required with fine gut and with a single hair
there must be many breakages For salmon Barker uses a rod ten feet in
the butt that will carry a top of six foot pretty stiffe and strong
The winder or reel Barker illustrates with a totally unintelligible
design His salmon fly carries six wings perhaps he only means wings
composed of six kinds of feathers but here Franck is a better authority
his flies being sensible and sober in colour Not many old salmon flies
are in existence nor have I seen more ancient specimens than a few
chiefly of peacocks feathers in the flyleaf of a book at Abbotsford
they were used in Ireland by Sir Walter Scotts eldest son The
controversy as to whether fish can distinguish colours was unknown to our
ancestors I am inclined to believe that for salmon size and perhaps
shade light or dark with more or less of tinsel are the only important
points Izaak stumbled on the idea of Mr Stewart author of _The
Practical Angler_ saying for the generality three or four flies
neat and rightly made and not too big serve for a trout in most
rivers all the summer Our ancestors though they did not fish with
the dry fly were intent on imitating the insect on the water As far as
my own experience goes if trout are feeding on duns one dun will take
them as well as another if it be properly presented But my friend Mr
Charles Longman tells me that after failing with two trout he examined
the fly on the water an olive dun and found in his book a fly which
exactly matched the natural insect in colour With this he captured his
brace

Such incidents look as if trout were particular to a shade but we can
never be certain that the angler did not make an especially artful and
delicate cast when he succeeded Sir Herbert Maxwell intends to make the
experiment of using duns of impossible and unnatural colours if he
succeeds with these on several occasions as well as with orthodox
flies perhaps we may decide that trout do not distinguish hues On a
Sutherland loch an angler found that trout would take flies of any
colour except that of a lightgreen leaf of a tree This rejection
decidedly looked as if even Sutherland loch trout exercised some
discrimination Often on a loch out of three flies they will favour
one and that perhaps not the trail fly The best rule is when you
find a favourite fly on a salmon river use it its special favouritism
may be a superstition but at all events salmon do take it We cannot
afford to be always making experiments but Mr Herbert Spencer busking
his flies the reverse way used certainly to be at least as successful
with sea trout as his less speculative neighbours in Argyllshire

In making rods Walton is most concerned with painting them I think a
good top is worth preserving or I had not taken care to keep a top above
twenty years Cotton prefers rods made in Yorkshire having advanced
from the homemade stage His were spliced and kept up all through the
season as he had his water at his own door while Walton trudged to the
Lee and other streams near London when he was not fishing the Itchen or
Shawford Brook _The Anglers Vade Mecum_ recommends eighteenfeet rods
preferring a fir butt fashioned by the arrowmaker a hazel top and a
tip of whalebone This authority even more than Walton deals in
mysterious Oyntments of gum ivy horseleek asafoetida mans fat
cats fat powdered skulls and grave earth A ghoulish body is the
angler of the _Vade Mecum_ He recommends upstream fishing with worm
in a clear water and so is a predecessor of Mr Stewart When you have
hooked a good fish have an especial care to keep the rod bent lest he
run to the end of the line he means as does Walton lest he pull the
rod horizontal and break either hook or hold An old owner of my copy
adds in manuscript And hale him not to near ye top of the water lest
in flaskering he break ye line

This is a favourite device of sea trout which are very apt to flasker
on the top of the water The _Vade Mecum_ in advance of Walton on this
point recommends a swivel in minnowfishing but has no idea of an
artificial minnow of silk I have known an ingenious lady who when the
bodies of her phantom minnows gave out in Norway supplied their place
successfully with bedquilting artfully sewn In fact anything bright
and spinning will allure fish though in the upper Ettrick where large
trout exist they will take the natural but perhaps never the phantom or
angel minnow I once tried a spinning Alexandra fly over some large pond
trout They followed it eagerly but never took hold on the first day
afterwards they would not look at it at all The _Vade Mecum_ man like
Dr Hamilton recommends a light fly for a light day a dark fly for a
dark day and dark weather others hold the converse opinion Every one
agrees that the smallness of the flies should be in proportion to the
lowness of the water and the advance of summer 7

Our ancestors apparently used only one fly at a time in rapid rivers
with wet fly two three or in lochs like Loch Leven even four are
employed To my mind more than two only cause entanglements of the
tackle The old English anglers knew of course little or nothing of
loch fishing using bait in lakes The great length of their rods made
reels less necessary and they do not seem to have waded much A modern
angler casting upwards from the middle of the stream with a ninefoot
rod would have astonished Walton They dealt with trout less educated
than ours and tooled with much coarser and heavier implements They had
no fine scruples about bait of every kind any more than the Scots have
and Barker loved a lobworm fished on the surface in a dark night He
was a potfisher and had been a cook He could catch a huge basket of
trout and dress them in many different waysbroyled calvored hot with
antchovaes sauce boyled soused stewed fried battered with eggs
roasted baked calvored cold and marilled or potted also marrionated
Barker instructs my Lord Montague to fish with salmon roe a thing
prohibited and very popular in Scotland If I had known it but twenty
years agoe I would have gained a hundred pounds onely with that bait I
am bound in duty to divulge it to your Honour and not to carry it to my
grave with me I do desire that men of quality should have it that
delight in that pleasure the greedy angler will murmur at me but for
that I care not Barker calls salmon roe an experience I have found of
late the best bait for a trout that I have seen in all my time and it
is the most deadly in the eddy of a turbid water Perhaps trout would
take caviare which is not forbidden by the law of the land Any
unscrupulous person may make the experiment and argue the matter out
with the waterbailie But in my country it is more usual to duck that
official and go on netting sniggling salmonroeing and destroying
sport in the sacred name of Liberty

 Scots wha fish wi salmon roe
 Scots wha sniggle as ye go
 Wull ye stand the Bailie No
 Let the limmer die

 Nows the day and nows the time
 Poison a the burns wi lime
 Fishing fairs a dastard crime
 Were for fishing _free_

Ydle persones sholde have but lyttyl mesure in the sayd disporte of
fysshyng says our old _Treatise_ but in southern Scotland they have
left few fish to dysporte with and the trout is like to become an
extinct animal Izaak would especially have disliked Fishing
Competitions which by dint of the multitude of anglers turn the
contemplative mans recreation into a crowded skirmish and we would
repeat his remark the rabble herd themselves together a dozen in one
pool often and endeavour to govern and act in spite of authority

For my part had I a river I would gladly let all honest anglers that
use the fly cast line in it but where there is no protection then
nets poison dynamite slaughter of fingerlings and unholy baits
devastate the fish so that Free Fishing spells no fishing at all This
presses most hardly on the artisan who fishes fair a member of a large
class with whose pastime only a churl would wish to interfere We are
now compelled if we would catch fish to seek Tarpon in Florida Mahseer
in India it does not suffice to stretch our legs up Tottenham Hill

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
