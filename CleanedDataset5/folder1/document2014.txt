Lover and friend hast thou put far from me
and mine acquaintance into darkness
 PSALM lxxxviii 18




CHAPTER I

Robert Bunting and Ellen his wife sat before their dully burning
carefullybankedup fire

The room especially when it be known that it was part of a house
standing in a grimy if not exactly sordid London thoroughfare
was exceptionally clean and wellcaredfor A casual stranger
more particularly one of a Superior class to their own on suddenly
opening the door of that sittingroom would have thought that Mr
and Mrs Bunting presented a very pleasant cosy picture of
comfortable married life Bunting who was leaning back in a deep
leather armchair was cleanshaven and dapper still in appearance
what he had been for many years of his lifea selfrespecting
manservant

On his wife now sitting up in an uncomfortable straightbacked
chair the marks of past servitude were less apparent but they
were there all the samein her neat black stuff dress and in
her scrupulously clean plain collar and cuffs Mrs Bunting as
a single woman had been what is known as a useful maid

But peculiarly true of average English life is the timeworn
English proverb as to appearances being deceitful Mr and Mrs
Bunting were sitting in a very nice room and in their timehow
long ago it now seemedboth husband and wife had been proud of
their carefully chosen belongings Everything in the room was
strong and substantial and each article of furniture had been
bought at a wellconducted auction held in a private house

Thus the red damask curtains which now shut out the fogladen
drizzling atmosphere of the Marylebone Road had cost a mere song
and yet they might have been warranted to last another thirty years
A great bargain also had been the excellent Axminster carpet which
covered the floor as again the armchair in which Bunting now sat
forward staring into the dull small fire In fact that armchair
had been an extravagance of Mrs Bunting She had wanted her husband
to be comfortable after the days work was done and she had paid
thirtyseven shillings for the chair Only yesterday Bunting had
tried to find a purchaser for it but the man who had come to look at
it guessing their cruel necessities had only offered them twelve
shillings and sixpence for it so for the present they were keeping
their armchair

But man and woman want something more than mere material comfort
much as that is valued by the Buntings of this world So on the
walls of the sittingroom hung neatly framed if now rather faded
photographsphotographs of Mr and Mrs Buntings various former
employers and of the pretty country houses in which they had
separately lived during the long years they had spent in a not
unhappy servitude

But appearances were not only deceitful they were more than
usually deceitful with regard to these unfortunate people In
spite of their good furniturethat substantial outward sign of
respectability which is the last thing which wise folk who fall
into trouble try to dispose ofthey were almost at the end of
their tether Already they had learnt to go hungry and they were
beginning to learn to go cold Tobacco the last thing the sober
man foregoes among his comforts had been given up some time ago
by Bunting And even Mrs Buntingprim prudent careful woman
as she was in her wayhad realised what this must mean to him
So well indeed had she understood that some days back she had
crept out and bought him a packet of Virginia

Bunting had been touchedtouched as he had not been for years by
any womans thought and love for him Painful tears had forced
themselves into his eyes and husband and wife had both felt in
their odd unemotional way moved to the heart

Fortunately he never guessedhow could he have guessed with his
slow normal rather dull mindthat his poor Ellen had since
more than once bitterly regretted that fourpencehapenny for they
were now very near the soundless depths which divide those who dwell
on the safe tableland of securitythose that is who are sure of
making a respectable if not a happy livingand the submerged
multitude who through some lack in themselves or owing to the
conditions under which our strange civilisation has become organised
struggle rudderless till they die in workhouse hospital or prison

Had the Buntings been in a class lower than their own had they
belonged to the great company of human beings technically known to
so many of us as the poor there would have been friendly neighbours
ready to help them and the same would have been the case had they
belonged to the class of smug wellmeaning if unimaginative folk
whom they had spent so much of their lives in serving

There was only one person in the world who might possibly be brought
to help them That was an aunt of Buntings first wife With this
woman the widow of a man who had been welltodo lived Daisy
Buntings only child by his first wife and during the last long two
days he had been trying to make up his mind to write to the old lady
and that though he suspected that she would almost certainly retort
with a cruel sharp rebuff

As to their few acquaintances former fellowservants and so on
they had gradually fallen out of touch with them There was but
one friend who often came to see them in their deep trouble This
was a young fellow named Chandler under whose grandfather Bunting
had been footman years and years ago Joe Chandler had never gone
into service he was attached to the police in fact not to put too
fine a point upon it young Chandler was a detective

When they had first taken the house which had brought them so they
both thought such bad luck Bunting had encouraged the young chap
to come often for his tales were well worth listening toquite
exciting at times But now poor Bunting didnt want to hear that
sort of storiesstories of people being cleverly nabbed or
stupidly allowed to escape the fate they always from Chandlers
point of view richly deserved

But Joe still came very faithfully once or twice a week so timing
his calls that neither host nor hostess need press food upon him
nay more he had done that which showed him to have a good and
feeling heart He had offered his fathers old acquaintance a loan
and Bunting at last had taken 30s Very little of that money
now remained Bunting still could jingle a few coppers in his pocket
and Mrs Bunting had 2s 9d that and the rent they would have to
pay in five weeks was all they had left Everything of the light
portable sort that would fetch money had been sold Mrs Bunting
had a fierce horror of the pawnshop She had never put her feet in
such a place and she declared she never wouldshe would rather
starve first

But she had said nothing when there had occurred the gradual
disappearance of various little possessions she knew that Bunting
valued notably of the oldfashioned gold watchchain which had been
given to him after the death of his first master a master he had
nursed faithfully and kindly through a long and terrible illness
There had also vanished a twisted gold tiepin and a large mourning
ring both gifts of former employers

When people are living near that deep pit which divides the secure
from the insecurewhen they see themselves creeping closer and
closer to its dread edgethey are apt however loquacious by
nature to fall into long silences Bunting had always been a
talker but now he talked no more Neither did Mrs Bunting but
then she had always been a silent woman and that was perhaps one
reason why Bunting had felt drawn to her from the very first moment
he had seen her

It had fallen out in this way A lady had just engaged him as
butler and he had been shown by the man whose place he was to
take into the diningroom There to use his own expression he
had discovered Ellen Green carefully pouring out the glass of port
wine which her then mistress always drank at 1130 every morning
And as he the new butler had seen her engaged in this task as he
had watched her carefully stopper the decanter and put it back into
the old winecooler he had said to himself That is the woman for
me

But now her stillness herher dumbness had got on the
unfortunate mans nerves He no longer felt like going into the
various little shops close by patronised by him in more prosperous
days and Mrs Bunting also went afield to make the slender purchases
which still had to be made every day or two if they were to be
saved from actually starving to death

Suddenly across the stillness of the dark November evening there
came the muffled sounds of hurrying feet and of loud shrill shouting
outsideboys crying the late afternoon editions of the evening
papers

Bunting turned uneasily in his chair The giving up of a daily
paper had been after his tobacco his bitterest deprivation And
the paper was an older habit than the tobacco for servants are
great readers of newspapers

As the shouts came through the closed windows and the thick damask
curtains Bunting felt a sudden sense of mind hunger fall upon him

It was a shamea damned shamethat he shouldnt know what was
happening in the world outside Only criminals are kept from hearing
news of what is going on beyond their prison walls And those
shouts those hoarse sharp cries must portend that something really
exciting had happened something warranted to make a man forget for
the moment his own intimate gnawing troubles

He got up and going towards the nearest window strained his ears to
listen There fell on them emerging now and again from the confused
babel of hoarse shouts the one clear word Murder

Slowly Buntings brain pieced the loud indistinct cries into some
sort of connected order Yes that was itHorrible Murder
Murder at St Pancras Bunting remembered vaguely another murder
which had been committed near St Pancrasthat of an old lady by
her servantmaid It had happened a great many years ago but was
still vividly remembered as of special and natural interest among
the class to which he had belonged

The newsboysfor there were more than one of them a rather unusual
thing in the Marylebone Roadwere coming nearer and nearer now
they had adopted another cry but he could not quite catch what they
were crying They were still shouting hoarsely excitedly but he
could only hear a word or two now and then Suddenly The Avenger
The Avenger at his work again broke on his ear

During the last fortnight four very curious and brutal murders had
been committed in London and within a comparatively small area

The first had aroused no special interesteven the second had only
been awarded in the paper Bunting was still then taking in quite a
small paragraph

Then had come the thirdand with that a wave of keen excitement
for pinned to the dress of the victima drunken womanhad been
found a threecornered piece of paper on which was written in red
ink and in printed characters the words

THE AVENGER

It was then realised not only by those whose business it is to
investigate such terrible happenings but also by the vast world
of men and women who take an intelligent interest in such sinister
mysteries that the same miscreant had committed all three crimes
and before that extraordinary fact had had time to soak well into
the public mind there took place yet another murder and again the
murderer had been to special pains to make it clear that some
obscure and terrible lust for vengeance possessed him

Now everyone was talking of The Avenger and his crimes Even the
man who left their haporth of milk at the door each morning had
spoken to Bunting about them that very day



Bunting came back to the fire and looked down at his wife with mild
excitement Then seeing her pale apathetic face her look of
weary mournful absorption a wave of irritation swept through him
He felt he could have shaken her

Ellen had hardly taken the trouble to listen when he Bunting had
come back to bed that morning and told her what the milkman had
said In fact she had been quite nasty about it intimating that
she didnt like hearing about such horrid things

It was a curious fact that though Mrs Bunting enjoyed tales of
pathos and sentiment and would listen with frigid amusement to
the details of a breach of promise action she shrank from stories
of immorality or of physical violence In the old happy days
when they could afford to buy a paper aye and more than one paper
daily Bunting had often had to choke down his interest in some
exciting case or mystery which was affording him pleasant mental
relaxation because any allusion to it sharply angered Ellen

But now he was at once too dull and too miserable to care how she
felt

Walking away from the window he took a slow uncertain step towards
the door when there he turned half round and there came over his
closeshaven round face the rather sly pleading look with which
a child about to do something naughty glances at its parent

But Mrs Bunting remained quite still her thin narrow shoulders
just showed above the back of the chair on which she was sitting
bolt upright staring before her as if into vacancy

Bunting turned round opened the door and quickly he went out into
the dark hallthey had given up lighting the gas there some time
agoand opened the front door

Walking down the small flagged path outside he flung open the iron
gate which gave on to the damp pavement But there he hesitated
The coppers in his pocket seemed to have shrunk in number and he
remembered ruefully how far Ellen could make even four pennies go

Then a boy ran up to him with a sheaf of evening papers and Bunting
being sorely temptedfell Give me a Sun he said roughly Sun
or Echo

But the boy scarcely stopping to take breath shook his head Only
penny papers left he gasped Whatll yer ave sir

With an eagerness which was mingled with shame Bunting drew a penny
out of his pocket and took a paperit was the Evening Standard
from the boys hand

Then very slowly he shut the gate and walked back through the raw
cold air up the flagged path shivering yet full of eager joyful
anticipation

Thanks to that penny he had just spent so recklessly he would pass
a happy hour taken for once out of his anxious despondent
miserable self It irritated him shrewdly to know that these moments
of respite from carking care would not be shared with his poor wife
with careworn troubled Ellen

A hot wave of unease almost of remorse swept over Bunting Ellen
would never have spent that penny on herselfhe knew that well
enoughand if it hadnt been so cold so foggy soso drizzly
he would have gone out again through the gate and stood under the
street lamp to take his pleasure He dreaded with a nervous dread
the glance of Ellens cold reproving lightblue eye That glance
would tell him that he had had no business to waste a penny on a
paper and that well he knew it

Suddenly the door in front of him opened and he beard a familiar
voice saying crossly yet anxiously What on earth are you doing
out there Bunting Come indo Youll catch your death of cold
I dont want to have you ill on my hands as well as everything else
Mrs Bunting rarely uttered so many words at once nowadays

He walked in through the front door of his cheerless house I
went out to get a paper he said sullenly

After all he was master He had as much right to spend the money
as she had for the matter of that the money on which they were now
both living had been lent nay pressed on himnot on Ellenby
that decent young chap Joe Chandler And he Bunting had done
all he could he had pawned everything he could pawn while Ellen
so he resentfully noticed still wore her wedding ring

He stepped past her heavily and though she said nothing he knew
she grudged him his coming joy Then full of rage with her and
contempt for himself and giving himself the luxury of a mild a
very mild oathEllen had very early made it clear she would
have no swearing in her presencehe lit the hall gas fullflare

How can we hope to get lodgers if they cant even see the card
he shouted angrily

And there was truth in what he said for now that he had lit the
gas the oblong card though not the word Apartments printed on
it could be plainly seen outlined against the oldfashioned
fanlight above the front door

Bunting went into the sittingroom silently followed by his wife
and then sitting down in his nice armchair he poked the little
bankedup fire It was the first time Bunting had poked the fire
for many a long day and this exertion of marital authority made
him feel better A man has to assert himself sometimes and he
Bunting had not asserted himself enough lately

A little colour came into Mrs Buntings pale face She was not
used to be flouted in this way For Bunting when not thoroughly
upset was the mildest of men

She began moving about the room flicking off an imperceptible
touch of dust here straightening a piece of furniture there

But her hands trembledthey trembled with excitement with
selfpity with anger A penny It was dreadfuldreadful to
have to worry about a penny But they had come to the point when
one has to worry about pennies Strange that her husband didnt
realise that

Bunting looked round once or twice he would have liked to ask Ellen
to leave off fidgeting but he was fond of peace and perhaps by
now a little bit ashamed of himself so he refrained from remark
and she soon gave over what irritated him of her own accord

But Mrs Bunting did not come and sit down as her husband would have
liked her to do The sight of him absorbed in his paper as he was
irritated her and made her long to get away from him Opening the
door which separated the sittingroom from the bedroom behind and
shutting out the aggravating vision of Bunting sitting comfortably
by the now brightly burning fire with the Evening Standard spread
out before himshe sat down in the cold darkness and pressed her
hands against her temples

Never never had she felt so hopeless soso broken as now Where
was the good of having been an upright conscientious selfrespecting
woman all her life long if it only led to this utter degrading
poverty and wretchedness She and Bunting were just past the age
which gentlefolk think proper in a married couple seeking to enter
service together unless that is the wife happens to be a professed
cook A cook and a butler can always get a nice situation But Mrs
Bunting was no cook She could do all right the simple things any
lodger she might get would require but that was all

Lodgers How foolish she had been to think of taking lodgers For
it had been her doing Bunting had been like butter in her hands

Yet they had begun well with a lodginghouse in a seaside place
There they had prospered not as they had hoped to do but still
pretty well and then had come an epidemic of scarlet fever and
that had meant ruin for them and for dozens nay hundreds of
other luckless people Then had followed a business experiment
which had proved even more disastrous and which had left them in
debtin debt to an extent they could never hope to repay to a
goodnatured former employer

After that instead of going back to service as they might have
done perhaps either together or separately they had made up
their minds to make one last effort and they had taken over with
the trifle of money that remained to them the lease of this house
in the Marylebone Road

In former days when they had each been leading the sheltered
impersonal and above all financially easy existence which is
the compensation life offers to those men and women who deliberately
take upon themselves the yoke of domestic service they had both
lived in houses overlooking Regents Park It had seemed a wise
plan to settle in the same neighbourhood the more so that Bunting
who had a good appearance had retained the kind of connection
which enables a man to get a job now and again as waiter at private
parties

But life moves quickly jaggedly for people like the Buntings
Two of his former masters had moved to another part of London and
a caterer in Baker Street whom he had known went bankrupt

And now Well just now Bunting could not have taken a job had
one been offered him for he had pawned his dress clothes He had
not asked his wifes permission to do this as so good a husband
ought to have done He had just gone out and done it And she had
not had the heart to say anything nay it was with part of the
money that he had handed her silently the evening he did it that
she had bought that last packet of tobacco

And then as Mrs Bunting sat there thinking these painful thoughts
there suddenly came to the front door the sound of a loud tremulous
uncertain double knock



CHAPTER II

Mr Bunting jumped nervously to her feet She stood for a moment
listening in the darkness a darkness made the blacker by the line
of light under the door behind which sat Bunting reading his paper

And then it came again that loud tremulous uncertain double
knock not a knock so the listener told herself that boded any
good Wouldbe lodgers gave sharp quick bold confident raps
No this must be some kind of beggar The queerest people came at
all hours and askedwhining or threateningfor money

Mrs Bunting had had some sinister experiences with men and women
especially womendrawn from that nameless mysterious class
made up of the human flotsam and jetsam which drifts about every
great city But since she had taken to leaving the gas in the
passage unlit at night she had been very little troubled with that
kind of visitors those human bats which are attracted by any kind
of light but leave alone those who live in darkness

She opened the door of the sittingroom It was Buntings place
to go to the front door but she knew far better than he did how
to deal with difficult or obtrusive callers Still somehow she
would have liked him to go tonight But Bunting sat on absorbed
in his newspaper all he did at the sound of the bedroom door
opening was to look up and say Didnt you hear a knock

Without answering his question she went out into the hall

Slowly she opened the front door

On the top of the three steps which led up to the door there stood
the long lanky figure of a man clad in an Inverness cape and an
oldfashioned top hat He waited for a few seconds blinking at her
perhaps dazzled by the light of the gas in the passage Mrs
Buntings trained perception told her at once that this man odd as
he looked was a gentleman belonging by birth to the class with
whom her former employment had brought her in contact

Is it not a fact that you let lodgings he asked and there was
something shrill unbalanced hesitating in his voice

Yes sir she said uncertainlyit was a long long time since
anyone had come after their lodgings anyone that is that they
could think of taking into their respectable house

Instinctively she stepped a little to one side and the stranger
walked past her and so into the hall

And then for the first time Mrs Bunting noticed that he held a
narrow bag in his left hand It was quite a new bag made of strong
brown leather

I am looking for some quiet rooms he said then he repeated the
words quiet rooms in a dreamy absent way and as he uttered
them he looked nervously round him

Then his sallow face brightened for the hall had been carefully
furnished and was very clean

There was a neat hatandumbrella stand and the strangers weary
feet fell soft on a good serviceable darkred drugget which
matched in colour the flockpaper on the walls

A very superior lodginghouse this and evidently a superior
lodginghouse keeper

Youd find my rooms quite quiet sir she said gently And just
now I have four to let The house is empty save for my husband
and me sir

Mrs Bunting spoke in a civil passionless voice It seemed too
good to be true this sudden coming of a possible lodger and of a
lodger who spoke in the pleasant courteous way and voice which
recalled to the poor woman her happy faroff days of youth and
of security

That sounds very suitable he said Four rooms Well perhaps
I ought only to take two rooms but still I should like to see
all four before I make my choice

How fortunate how very fortunate it was that Bunting had lit the
gas But for that circumstance this gentleman would have passed
them by

She turned towards the staircase quite forgetting in her agitation
that the front door was still open and it was the stranger whom
she already in her mind described as the lodger who turned and
rather quickly walked down the passage and shut it

Oh thank you sir she exclaimed Im sorry you should have
had the trouble

For a moment their eyes met Its not safe to leave a front door
open in London he said rather sharply I hope you do not often
do that It would be so easy for anyone to slip in

Mrs Bunting felt rather upset The stranger had still spoken
courteously but he was evidently very much put out

I assure you sir I never leave my front door open she answered
hastily You neednt be at all afraid of that

And then through the closed door of the sittingroom came the
sound of Bunting coughingit was just a little hard cough but
Mrs Buntings future lodger started violently

Whos that he said putting out a hand and clutching her arm
Whatever was that

Only my husband sir He went out to buy a paper a few minutes
ago and the cold just caught him I suppose

Your husband he looked at her intently suspiciously What
what may I ask is your husbands occupation

Mrs Bunting drew herself up The question as to Buntings
occupation was no ones business but theirs Still it wouldnt do
for her to show offence He goes out waiting she said stiffly
He was a gentlemans servant sir He could of course valet you
should you require him to do so

And then she turned and led the way up the steep narrow staircase

At the top of the first flight of stairs was what Mrs Bunting to
herself called the drawingroom floor It consisted of a
sittingroom in front and a bedroom behind She opened the door
of the sittingroom and quickly lit the chandelier

This front room was pleasant enough though perhaps a little
overencumbered with furniture Covering the floor was a green
carpet simulating moss four chairs were placed round the table
which occupied the exact middle of the apartment and in the
corner opposite the door giving on to the landing was a roomy
oldfashioned chiffonnier

On the darkgreen walls hung a series of eight engravings portraits
of early Victorian belles clad in lace and tarletan ball dresses
clipped from an old Book of Beauty Mrs Bunting was very fond of
these pictures she thought they gave the drawingroom a note of
elegance and refinement

As she hurriedly turned up the gas she was glad glad indeed that
she had summoned up sufficient energy two days ago to give the
room a thorough turnout

It had remained for a long time in the state in which it had been
left by its last dishonest dirty occupants when they had been
scared into going away by Buntings rough threats of the police
But now it was in applepie order with one paramount exception
of which Mrs Bunting was painfully aware There were no white
curtains to the windows but that omission could soon be remedied
if this gentleman really took the lodgings

But what was this The stranger was looking round him rather
dubiously This is ratherrather too grand for me he said at
last I should like to see your other rooms Mrs er

Bunting she said softly Bunting sir

And as she spoke the dark heavy load of care again came down and
settled on her sad burdened heart Perhaps she had been mistaken
after allor rather she had not been mistaken in one sense but
perhaps this gentleman was a poor gentlemantoo poor that is to
afford the rent of more than one room say eight or ten shillings
a week eight or ten shillings a week would be very little use to
her and Bunting though better than nothing at all

Will you just look at the bedroom sir

No he said no I think I should like to see what you have
farther up the house Mrs and then as if making a prodigious
mental effort he brought out her name Bunting with a kind of
gasp

The two top rooms were of course immediately above the
drawingroom floor But they looked poor and mean owing to the fact
that they were bare of any kind of ornament Very little trouble had
been taken over their arrangement in fact they had been left in much
the same condition as that in which the Buntings had found them

For the matter of that it is difficult to make a nice genteel
sittingroom out of an apartment of which the principal features
are a sink and a big gas stove The gas stove of an obsolete
pattern was fed by a tiresome shillingintheslot arrangement
It had been the property of the people from whom the Buntings had
taken over the lease of the house who knowing it to be of no
monetary value had thrown it in among the humble fittings they
had left behind

What furniture there was in the room was substantial and clean as
everything belonging to Mrs Bunting was bound to be but it was a
bare uncomfortablelooking place and the landlady now felt sorry
that she had done nothing to make it appear more attractive

To her surprise however her companions dark sensitive
hatchetshaped face became irradiated with satisfaction Capital
Capital he exclaimed for the first time putting down the bag he
held at his feet and rubbing his long thin hands together with a
quick nervous movement

This is just what I have been looking for He walked with long
eager strides towards the gas stove Firstratequite firstrate
Exactly what I wanted to find You must understand Mrser
Bunting that I am a man of science I make that is all sorts of
experiments and I often require theah well the presence of
great heat

He shot out a hand which she noticed shook a little towards the
stove This too will be usefulexceedingly useful to me and
he touched the edge of the stone sink with a lingering caressing
touch

He threw his head back and passed his hand over his high bare
forehead then moving towards a chair he sat downwearily
Im tired he muttered in a low voice tiredtired Ive been
walking about all day Mrs Bunting and I could find nothing to sit
down upon They do not put benches for tired men in the London
streets They do so on the Continent In some ways they are far
more humane on the Continent than they are in England Mrs Bunting

Indeed sir she said civilly and then after a nervous glance
she asked the question of which the answer would mean so much to her
Then you mean to take my rooms sir

This room certainly he said looking round This room is
exactly what I have been looking for and longing for the last
few days and then hastily he added I mean this kind of place
is what I have always wanted to possess Mrs Bunting You would
be surprised if you knew how difficult it is to get anything of
the sort But now my weary search has ended and that is a relief
a very very great relief to me

He stood up and looked round him with a dreamy abstracted air And
then Wheres my bag he asked suddenly and there came a note of
sharp angry fear in his voice He glared at the quiet woman
standing before him and for a moment Mrs Bunting felt a tremor of
fright shoot through her It seemed a pity that Bunting was so far
away right down the house

But Mrs Bunting was aware that eccentricity has always been a
perquisite as it were the special luxury of the wellborn and of
the welleducated Scholars as she well knew are never quite like
other people and her new lodger was undoubtedly a scholar Surely
I had a bag when I came in he said in a scared troubled voice

Here it is sir she said soothingly and stooping picked it
up and handed it to him And as she did so she noticed that the
bag was not at all heavy it was evidently by no means full

He took it eagerly from her I beg your pardon he muttered
But there is something in that bag which is very precious to me
something I procured with infinite difficulty and which I could
never get again without running into great danger Mrs Bunting
That must be the excuse for my late agitation

About terms sir she said a little timidly returning to the
subject which meant so much so very much to her

About terms he echoed And then there came a pause My name
is Sleuth he said suddenlySleuth Think of a hound
Mrs Bunting and youll never forget my name I could provide you
with a reference he gave her what she described to herself as
a funny sideways look but I should prefer you to dispense with
that if you dont mind I am quite willing to pay youwell shall
we say a month in advance

A spot of red shot into Mrs Buntings cheeks She felt sick with
reliefnay with a joy which was almost pain She had not known
till that moment how hungry she washow eager fora good meal
That would be all right sir she murmured

And what are you going to charge me There had come a kindly
almost a friendly note into his voice With attendance mind I
shall expect you to give me attendance and I need hardly ask if
you can cook Mrs Bunting

Oh yes sir she said I am a plain cook What would you say
to twentyfive shillings a week sir She looked at him
deprecatingly and as he did not answer she went on falteringly
You see sir it may seem a good deal but you would have the best
of attendance and careful cookingand my husband sirhe would
be pleased to valet you

I shouldnt want anything of that sort done for me said Mr
Sleuth hastily I prefer looking after my own clothes I am used
to waiting on myself But Mrs Bunting I have a great dislike to
sharing lodgings

She interrupted eagerly I could let you have the use of the two
floors for the same pricethat is until we get another lodger
I shouldnt like you to sleep in the back room up here sir Its
such a poor little room You could do as you say sirdo your work
and your experiments up here and then have your meals in the
drawingroom

Yes he said hesitatingly that sounds a good plan And if I
offered you two pounds or two guineas Might I then rely on your
not taking another lodger

Yes she said quietly Id be very glad only to have you to
wait on sir

I suppose you have a key to the door of this room Mrs Bunting
I dont like to be disturbed while Im working

He waited a moment and then said again rather urgently I suppose
you have a key to this door Mrs Bunting

Oh yes sir theres a keya very nice little key The people
who lived here before had a new kind of lock put on to the door
She went over and throwing the door open showed him that a round
disk had been fitted above the old keyhole

He nodded his head and then after standing silent a little as if
absorbed in thought Fortytwo shillings a week Yes that will
suit me perfectly And Ill begin now by paying my first months
rent in advance Now four times fortytwo shillings ishe
jerked his head back and stared at his new landlady for the first
time he smiled a queer wry smilewhy just eight pounds eight
shillings Mrs Bunting

He thrust his hand through into an inner pocket of his long
capelike coat and took out a handful of sovereigns Then he began
putting these down in a row on the bare wooden table which stood in
the centre of the room Heres fivesixseveneightnine
ten pounds Youd better keep the odd change Mrs Bunting
for I shall want you to do some shopping for me tomorrow morning
I met with a misfortune today But the new lodger did not speak
as if his misfortune whatever it was weighed on his spirits

Indeed sir Im sorry to hear that Mrs Buntings heart was
going thumpthumpthump She felt extraordinarily moved dizzy
with relief and joy

Yes a very great misfortune I lost my luggage the few things
I managed to bring away with me His voice dropped suddenly I
shouldnt have said that he muttered I was a fool to say that
Then more loudly Someone said to me You cant go into a
lodginghouse without any luggage They wouldnt take you in But
you have taken me in Mrs Bunting and Im grateful forfor the
kind way you have met me He looked at her feelingly appealingly
and Mrs Bunting was touched She was beginning to feel very kindly
towards her new lodger

I hope I know a gentleman when I see one she said with a break
in her staid voice

I shall have to see about getting some clothes tomorrow Mrs Bunting
Again he looked at her appealingly

I expect youd like to wash your hands now sir And would you tell
me what youd like for supper We havent much in the house

Oh anythingll do he said hastily I dont want you to go out
for me Its a cold foggy wet night Mrs Bunting If you have a
little breadandbutter and a cup of milk I shall be quite satisfied

I have a nice sausage she said hesitatingly

It was a very nice sausage and she had bought it that same morning
for Buntings supper as to herself she had been going to content
herself with a little bread and cheese But nowwonderful almost
intoxicating thoughtshe could send Bunting out to get anything
they both liked The ten sovereigns lay in her hand full of comfort
and good cheer

A sausage No I fear that will hardly do I never touch flesh
meat he said it is a long long time since I tasted a sausage
Mrs Bunting

Is it indeed sir She hesitated a moment then asked stiffly
And will you be requiring any beer or wine sir

A strange wild look of lowering wrath suddenly filled Mr Sleuths
pale face

Certainly not I thought I had made that quite clear Mrs Bunting
I had hoped to hear that you were an abstainer

So I am sir lifelong And sos Bunting been since we married
She might have said had she been a woman given to make such
confidences that she had made Bunting abstain very early in their
acquaintance That he had given in about that had been the thing
that first made her believe that he was sincere in all the nonsense
that he talked to her in those faraway days of his courting Glad
she was now that he had taken the pledge as a younger man but for
that nothing would have kept him from the drink during the bad times
they had gone through

And then going downstairs she showed Mr Sleuth the nice bedroom
which opened out of the drawingroom It was a replica of Mrs
Buntings own room just underneath excepting that everything up
here had cost just a little more and was therefore rather better
in quality

The new lodger looked round him with such a strange expression of
content and peace stealing over his worn face A haven of rest
he muttered and then He bringeth them to their desired haven
Beautiful words Mrs Bunting

Yes sir

Mrs Bunting felt a little startled It was the first time anyone
had quoted the Bible to her for many a long day But it seemed to
set the seal as it were on Mr Sleuths respectability

What a comfort it was too that she had to deal with only one
lodger and that a gentleman instead of with a married couple
Very peculiar married couples had drifted in and out of Mr and
Mrs Buntings lodgings not only here in London but at the
seaside

How unlucky they had been to be sure Since they had come to
London not a single pair of lodgers had been even moderately
respectable and kindly The last lot had belonged to that horrible
underworld of men and women who having as the phrase goes seen
better days now only keep their heads above water with the help of
petty fraud

Ill bring you up some hot water in a minute sir and some clean
towels she said going to the door

And then Mr Sleuth turned quickly round Mrs Buntingand as
he spoke he stammered a littleII dont want you to interpret
the word attendance too liberally You need not run yourself off
your feet for me Im accustomed to look after myself

And queerly uncomfortably she felt herself dismissedeven a
little snubbed All right sir she said Ill only just let
you know when Ive your supper ready



CHAPTER III

But what was a little snub compared with the intense relief and joy
of going down and telling Bunting of the great piece of good fortune
which had fallen their way

Staid Mrs Bunting seemed to make but one leap down the steep stairs
In the hall however she pulled herself together and tried to still
her agitation She had always disliked and despised any show of
emotion she called such betrayal of feeling making a fuss

Opening the door of their sittingroom she stood for a moment
looking at her husbands bent back and she realised with a pang
of pain how the last few weeks had aged him

Bunting suddenly looked round and seeing his wife stood up He
put the paper he had been holding down on to the table Well he
said well who was it then

He felt rather ashamed of himself it was he who ought to have
answered the door and done all that parleying of which he had heard
murmurs

And then in a moment his wifes hand shot out and the ten sovereigns
fell in a little clinking heap on the table

Look there she whispered with an excited tearful quiver in her
voice Look there Bunting

And Bunting did look there but with a troubled frowning gaze

He was not quickwitted but at once he jumped to the conclusion
that his wife had just had in a furniture dealer and that this
ten pounds represented all their nice furniture upstairs If that
were so then it was the beginning of the end That furniture in
the firstfloor front had costEllen had reminded him of the fact
bitterly only yesterdayseventeen pounds nine shillings and
every single item had been a bargain It was too bad that she had
only got ten pounds for it

Yet he hadnt the heart to reproach her

He did not speak as he looked across at her and meeting that
troubled rebuking glance she guessed what it was that he thought
had happened

Weve a new lodger she cried Andand Bunting Hes quite
the gentleman He actually offered to pay four weeks in advance at
two guineas a week

No never

Bunting moved quickly round the table and together they stood there
fascinated by the little heap of gold But theres ten sovereigns
here he said suddenly

Yes the gentleman said Id have to buy some things for him
tomorrow And oh Bunting hes so well spoken I really felt
thatI really felt that and then Mrs Bunting taking a step
or two sideways sat down and throwing her little black apron over
her face burst into gasping sobs

Bunting patted her back timidly Ellen he said much moved by her
agitation Ellen Dont take on so my dear

I wont she sobbed II wont Im a foolI know I am
But oh I didnt think we was ever going to have any luck again

And then she told himor rather tried to tell himwhat the
lodger was like Mrs Bunting was no hand at talking but one thing
she did impress on her husbands mind namely that Mr Sleuth was
eccentric as so many clever people are eccentricthat is in a
harmless wayand that he must be humoured

He says he doesnt want to be waited on much she said at last
wiping her eyes but I can see he will want a good bit of looking
after all the same poor gentleman

And just as the words left her mouth there came the unfamiliar sound
of a loud ring It was that of the drawingroom bell being pulled
again and again

Bunting looked at his wife eagerly I think Id better go up eh
Ellen he said He felt quite anxious to see their new lodger
For the matter of that it would be a relief to be doing something
again

Yes she answered you go up Dont keep him waiting I wonder
what it is he wants I said Id let him know when his supper was
ready

A moment later Bunting came down again There was an odd smile on
his face Whatever dyou think he wanted he whispered
mysteriously And as she said nothing he went on Hes asked me
for the loan of a Bible

Well I dont see anything so out of the way in that she said
hastily specially if he dont feel well Ill take it up to him

And then going to a small table which stood between the two windows
Mrs Bunting took off it a large Bible which had been given to her
as a wedding present by a married lady with whose mother she had
lived for several years

He said it would do quite well when you take up his supper said
Bunting and then Ellen Hes a queerlooking covenot like
any gentleman I ever had to do with

He is a gentleman said Mrs Bunting rather fiercely

Oh yes thats all right But still he looked at her doubtfully
I asked him if hed like me to just put away his clothes But
Ellen he said he hadnt got any clothes

No more he hasnt she spoke quickly defensively He had the
misfortune to lose his luggage Hes one dishonest folk ud take
advantage of

Yes one can see that with half an eye Bunting agreed

And then there was silence for a few moments while Mrs Bunting
put down on a little bit of paper the things she wanted her husband
to go out and buy for her She handed him the list together with
a sovereign Be as quick as you can she said for I feel a bit
hungry Ill be going down now to see about Mr Sleuths supper
He only wants a glass of milk and two eggs Im glad Ive never
fallen to bad eggs

Sleuth echoed Bunting staring at her What a queer name
How dyou spell itSluth

No she shot out Sleuth

Oh he said doubtfully

He said Think of a hound and youll never forget my name
and Mrs Bunting smiled

When he got to the door Bunting turned round Well now be able
to pay young Chandler back some o that thirty shillings I am
glad She nodded her heart as the saying is too full for words

And then each went about his and her businessBunting out into
the drenching fog his wife down to her cold kitchen

The lodgers tray was soon ready everything upon it nicely and
daintily arranged Mrs Bunting knew how to wait upon a gentleman

Just as the landlady was going up the kitchen stair she suddenly
remembered Mr Sleuths request for a Bible Putting the tray down
in the hall she went into her sittingroom and took up the Book
but when back in the hall she hesitated a moment as to whether it
was worth while to make two journeys But no she thought she
could manage clasping the large heavy volume under her arm and
taking up the tray she walked slowly up the staircase

But a great surprise awaited her in fact when Mr Sleuths
landlady opened the door of the drawingroom she very nearly dropped
the tray She actually did drop the Bible and it fell with a heavy
thud to the ground

The new lodger had turned all those nice framed engravings of the
early Victorian beauties of which Mrs Bunting had been so proud
with their faces to the wall

For a moment she was really too surprised to speak Putting the
tray down on the table she stooped and picked up the Book It
troubled her that the Book should have fallen to the ground but
really she hadnt been able to help itit was mercy that the
tray hadnt fallen too

Mr Sleuth got up II have taken the liberty to arrange the
room as I should wish it to be he said awkwardly You see
MrserBunting I felt as I sat here that these womens eyes
followed me about It was a most unpleasant sensation and gave
me quite an eerie feeling

The landlady was now laying a small tablecloth over half of the
table She made no answer to her lodgers remark for the good
reason that she did not know what to say

Her silence seemed to distress Mr Sleuth After what seemed a
long pause he spoke again

I prefer bare walls Mrs Bunting he spoke with some agitation
As a matter of fact I have been used to seeing bare walls about
me for a long time And then at last his landlady answered him
in a composed soothing voice which somehow did him good to hear
I quite understand sir And when Bunting comes in he shall take
the pictures all down We have plenty of space in our own rooms
for them

Thank youthank you very much

Mr Sleuth appeared greatly relieved

And I have brought you up my Bible sir I understood you wanted
the loan of it

Mr Sleuth stared at her as if dazed for a moment and then rousing
himself he said Yes yes I do There is no reading like the Book
There is something there which suits every state of mind aye and of
body too

Very true sir And then Mrs Bunting having laid out what really
looked a very appetising little meal turned round and quietly shut
the door

She went down straight into her sittingroom and waited there for
Bunting instead of going to the kitchen to clear up And as she
did so there came to her a comfortable recollection an incident of
her longpast youth in the days when she then Ellen Green had
maided a dear old lady

The old lady had a favourite nephewa bright jolly young gentleman
who was learning to paint animals in Paris And one morning Mr
Algernonthat was his rather peculiar Christian namehad had the
impudence to turn to the wall six beautiful engravings of paintings
done by the famous Mr Landseer

Mrs Bunting remembered all the circumstances as if they had only
occurred yesterday and yet she had not thought of them for years

It was quite early she had come downfor in those days maids
werent thought so much of as they are now and she slept with the
upper housemaid and it was the upper housemaids duty to be down
very earlyand there in the diningroom she had found Mr
Algernon engaged in turning each engraving to the wall Now his
aunt thought all the world of those pictures and Ellen had felt
quite concerned for it doesnt do for a young gentleman to put
himself wrong with a kind aunt

Oh sir she had exclaimed in dismay whatever are you doing
And even now she could almost hear his merry voice as he had
answered I am doing my duty fair Helenhe had always called
her fair Helen when no one was listening How can I draw ordinary
animals when I see these halfhuman monsters staring at me all the
time I am having my breakfast my lunch and my dinner That was
what Mr Algernon had said in his own saucy way and that was what
he repeated in a more serious respectful manner to his aunt when
that dear old lady had come downstairs In fact he had declared
quite soberly that the beautiful animals painted by Mr Landseer
put his eye out

But his aunt had been very much annoyedin fact she had made him
turn the pictures all back again and as long as he stayed there he
just had to put up with what he called those halfhuman monsters
Mrs Bunting sitting there thinking the matter of Mr Sleuths
odd behaviour over was glad to recall that funny incident of her
longgone youth It seemed to prove that her new lodger was not so
strange as he appeared to be Still when Bunting came in she did
not tell him the queer thing which had happened She told herself
that she would be quite able to manage the taking down of the
pictures in the drawingroom herself

But before getting ready their own supper Mr Sleuths landlady
went upstairs to clear away and when on the staircase she heard the
sound ofwas it talking in the drawingroom Startled she
waited a moment on the landing outside the drawingroom door then
she realised that it was only the lodger reading aloud to himself
There was something very awful in the words which rose and fell on
her listening ears

A strange woman is a narrow gate She also lieth in wait as for
a prey and increaseth the transgressors among men

She remained where she was her hand on the handle of the door
and again there broke on her shrinking ears that curious high
singsong voice Her house is the way to hell going down to
the chambers of death

It made the listener feel quite queer But at last she summoned up
courage knocked and walked in

Id better clear away sir had I not she said And Mr Sleuth
nodded

Then he got up and closed the Book I think Ill go to bed now
he said I am very very tired Ive had a long and a very
weary day Mrs Bunting

After he had disappeared into the back room Mrs Bunting climbed
up on a chair and unhooked the pictures which had so offended Mr
Sleuth Each left an unsightly mark on the wallbut that after
all could not be helped

Treading softly so that Bunting should not hear her she carried
them down two by two and stood them behind her bed



CHAPTER IV

Mrs Bunting woke up the next morning feeling happier than she had
felt for a very very long time

For just one moment she could not think why she felt so different
and then she suddenly remembered

How comfortable it was to know that upstairs just over her head
lay in the wellfound bed she had bought with such satisfaction at
an auction held in a Baker Street house a lodger who was paying two
guineas a week Something seemed to tell her that Mr Sleuth would
be a permanency In any case it wouldnt be her fault if he
wasnt As to hishis queerness well theres always something
funny in everybody But after she had got up and as the morning
wore itself away Mrs Bunting grew a little anxious for there
came no sound at all from the new lodgers rooms At twelve
however the drawingroom bell rang Mrs Bunting hurried upstairs
She was painfully anxious to please and satisfy Mr Sleuth His
coming had only been in the nick of time to save them from terrible
disaster

She found her lodger up and fully dressed He was sitting at the
round table which occupied the middle of the sittingroom and his
landladys large Bible lay open before him

As Mrs Bunting came in he looked up and she was troubled to see
how tired and worn he seemed

You did not happen he asked to have a Concordance Mrs
Bunting

She shook her head she had no idea what a Concordance could be
but she was quite sure that she had nothing of the sort about

And then her new lodger proceeded to tell her what it was he
desired her to buy for him She had supposed the bag he had
brought with him to contain certain little necessaries of
civilised lifesuch articles for instance as a comb and brush
a set of razors a toothbrush to say nothing of a couple of
nightshirtsbut no that was evidently not so for Mr Sleuth
required all these things to be bought now

After having cooked him a nice breakfast Mrs Bunting hurried
out to purchase the things of which he was in urgent need

How pleasant it was to feel that there was money in her purse
againnot only someone elses money but money she was now in
the very act of earning so agreeably

Mrs Bunting first made her way to a little barbers shop close by
It was there she purchased the brush and comb and the razors It
was a funny rather smelly little place and she hurried as much as
she could the more so that the foreigner who served her insisted
on telling her some of the strange peculiar details of this
Avenger murder which had taken place fortyeight hours before and
in which Bunting took such a morbid interest

The conversation upset Mrs Bunting She didnt want to think of
anything painful or disagreeable on such a day as this

Then she came back and showed the lodger her various purchases Mr
Sleuth was pleased with everything and thanked her most courteously
But when she suggested doing his bedroom he frowned and looked
quite put out

Please wait till this evening he said hastily It is my custom
to stay at home all day I only care to walk about the streets when
the lights are lit You must bear with me Mrs Bunting if I seem
a little just a little unlike the lodgers you have been accustomed
to And I must ask you to understand that I must not be disturbed
when thinking out my problems He broke off short sighed then
added solemnly for mine are the great problems of life and death

And Mrs Bunting willingly fell in with his wishes In spite of her
prim manner and love of order Mr Sleuths landlady was a true woman
she had that is an infinite patience with masculine vagaries
and oddities


When she was downstairs again Mr Sleuths landlady met with a
surprise but it was quite a pleasant surprise While she had
been upstairs talking to the lodger Buntings young friend Joe
Chandler the detective had come in and as she walked into the
sittingroom she saw that her husband was pushing half a sovereign
across the table towards Joe

Joe Chandlers fair goodnatured face was full of satisfaction
not at seeing his money again mark you but at the news Bunting
had evidently been telling himthat news of the sudden wonderful
change in their fortunes the coming of an ideal lodger

Mr Sleuth dont want me to do his bedroom till hes gone out
she exclaimed And then she sat down for a bit of a rest

It was a comfort to know that the lodger was eating his good
breakfast and there was no need to think of him for the present
In a few minutes she would be going down to make her own and
Buntings dinner and she told Joe Chandler that he might as well
stop and have a bite with them

Her heart warmed to the young man for Mrs Bunting was in a mood
which seldom surprised hera mood to be pleased with anything
and everything Nay more When Bunting began to ask Joe Chandler
about the last of those awful Avenger murders she even listened
with a certain languid interest to all he had to say

In the morning paper which Bunting had begun taking again that
very day three columns were devoted to the extraordinary mystery
which was now beginning to be the one topic of talk all over London
West and East North and South Bunting had read out little bits
about it while they ate their breakfast and in spite of herself
Mrs Bunting had felt thrilled and excited

They do say observed Bunting cautiously They do say Joe that
the police have a clue they wont say nothing about He looked
expectantly at his visitor To Bunting the fact that Chandler was
attached to the detective section of the Metropolitan Police
invested the young man with a kind of sinister gloryespecially
just now when these awful and mysterious crimes were amazing and
terrifying the town

Them who says that says wrong answered Chandler slowly and a
look of unease of resentment came over his fair stolid face
Twould make a good bit of difference to me if the Yard had a clue

And then Mrs Bunting interposed Why that Joe she said
smiling indulgently the young mans keenness about his work pleased
her And in his slow sure way Joe Chandler was very keen and took
his job very seriously He put his whole heart and mind into it

Well tis this way he explained From today Im on this
business myself You see Mrs Bunting the Yards nettledthats
what it is and were all on our mettlethat we are I was right
down sorry for the poor chap who was on point duty in the street
where the last one happened

No said Bunting incredulously You dont mean there was a
policeman there within a few yards

That fact hadnt been recorded in his newspaper

Chandler nodded Thats exactly what I do mean Mr Bunting The
man is near off his head so Im told He did hear a yell so he
says but he took no noticethere are a good few yells in that
part o London as you can guess People always quarrelling and
rowing at one another in such low parts

Have you seen the bits of grey paper on which the monster writes
his name inquired Bunting eagerly

Public imagination had been much stirred by the account of those
threecornered pieces of grey paper pinned to the victims skirts
on which was roughly written in red ink and in printed characters
the words The Avenger

His round fat face was full of questioning eagerness He put his
elbows on the table and stared across expectantly at the young man

Yes I have said Joe briefly

A funny kind of visiting card eh Bunting laughed the notion
struck him as downright comic

But Mrs Bunting coloured It isnt a thing to make a joke about
she said reprovingly

And Chandler backed her up No indeed he said feelingly Ill
never forget what Ive been made to see over this job And as for
that grey bit of paper Mr Buntingor rather those grey bits of
paperhe corrected himself hastilyyou know theyve three of
them now at the Yardwell they gives me the horrors

And then he jumped up That reminds me that I oughtnt to be
wasting my time in pleasant company

Wont you stay and have a bit of dinner said Mrs Bunting
solicitously

But the detective shook his head No he said I had a bite
before I came out Our jobs a queer kind of job as you know A
lots left to our discretion so to speak but it dont leave us
much time for lazing about I can tell you

When he reached the door he turned round and with elaborate
carelessness he inquired Any chance of Miss Daisy coming to London
again soon

Bunting shook his head but his face brightened He was very very
fond of his only child the pity was he saw her so seldom No
he said Im afraid not Joe Old Aunt as we calls the old lady
keeps Daisy pretty tightly tied to her apronstring She was quite
put about that week the child was up with us last June

Indeed Well so long

After his wife had let their friend out Bunting said cheerfully
Joe seems to like our Daisy eh Ellen

But Mrs Bunting shook her head scornfully She did not exactly
dislike the girl though she did not hold with the way Buntings
daughter was being managed by that old aunt of hersan idle
goodfornothing way very different from the fashion in which
she herself had been trained at the Foundling for Mrs Bunting
as a little child had known no other home no other family than
those provided by good Captain Coram

Joe Chandlers too sensible a young chap to be thinking of girls
yet awhile she said tartly

No doubt youre right Bunting agreed Times be changed In my
young days chaps always had time for that Twas just a notion that
came into my head hearing him asking anxiouslike after her



About five oclock after the street lamps were well alight Mr
Sleuth went out and that same evening there came two parcels
addressed to his landlady These parcels contained clothes But
it was quite clear to Mrs Buntings eyes that they were not new
clothes In fact they had evidently been bought in some good
secondhand clothesshop A funny thing for a real gentleman like
Mr Sleuth to do It proved that he had given up all hope of
getting back his lost luggage

When the lodger had gone out he had not taken his bag with him of
that Mrs Bunting was positive And yet though she searched high
and low for it she could not find the place where Mr Sleuth kept
it And at last had it not been that she was a very clearheaded
woman with a good memory she would have been disposed to think
that the bag had never existed save in her imagination

But no she could not tell herself that She remembered exactly
how it had looked when Mr Sleuth had first stood a strange
queerlooking figure of a man on her doorstep

She further remembered how he had put the bag down on the floor of
the top front room and then forgetting what he had done how he
had asked her eagerly in a tone of angry fear where the bag was
only to find it safely lodged at his feet

As time went on Mrs Bunting thought a great deal about that bag
for strange and amazing fact she never saw Mr Sleuths bag again
But of course she soon formed a theory as to its whereabouts
The brown leather bag which had formed Mr Sleuths only luggage
the afternoon of his arrival was almost certainly locked up in the
lower part of the drawingroom chiffonnier Mr Sleuth evidently
always carried the key of the little corner cupboard about his
person Mrs Bunting had also had a good hunt for that key but
as was the case with the bag the key disappeared and she never
saw either the one or the other again



CHAPTER V

How quietly how uneventfully how pleasantly sped the next few
days Already life was settling down into a groove Waiting on
Mr Sleuth was just what Mrs Bunting could manage to do easily
and without tiring herself

It had at once become clear that the lodger preferred to be waited
on only by one person and that person his landlady He gave her
very little trouble Indeed it did her good having to wait on the
lodger it even did her good that he was not like other gentlemen
for the fact occupied her mind and in a way it amused her The
more so that whatever his oddities Mr Sleuth had none of those
tiresome disagreeable ways with which landladies are only too
familiar and which seem peculiar only to those human beings who
also happen to be lodgers To take but one point Mr Sleuth did
not ask to be called unduly early Bunting and his Ellen had fallen
into the way of lying rather late in the morning and it was a great
comfort not to have to turn out to make the lodger a cup of tea at
seven or even halfpast seven Mr Sleuth seldom required anything
before eleven

But odd he certainly was

The second evening he had been with them Mr Sleuth had brought in
a book of which the queer name was Crudens Concordance That and
the BibleMrs Bunting had soon discovered that there was a
relation between the two booksseemed to be the lodgers only
reading He spent hours each day generally after he had eaten
the breakfast which also served for luncheon poring over the Old
Testament and over that strange kind of index to the Book

As for the delicate and yet the allimportant question of money
Mr Sleuth was everythingeverything that the most exacting
landlady could have wished Never had there been a more confiding
or trusting gentleman On the very first day he had been with them
he had allowed his moneythe considerable sum of one hundred and
eightyfour sovereignsto lie about wrapped up in little pieces
of rather dirty newspaper on his dressingtable That had quite
upset Mrs Bunting She had allowed herself respectfully to point
out to him that what he was doing was foolish indeed wrong But
as only answer he had laughed and she had been startled when the
loud unusual and discordant sound had issued from his thin lips

I know those I can trust he had answered stuttering rather as
was his way when moved Andand I assure you Mrs Bunting that
I hardly have to speak to a human beingespecially to a woman
and he had drawn in his breath with a hissing sound before I
know exactly what manner of person is before me

It hadnt taken the landlady very long to find out that her lodger
had a queer kind of fear and dislike of women When she was doing
the staircase and landings she would often hear Mr Sleuth reading
aloud to himself passages in the Bible that were very uncomplimentary
to her sex But Mrs Bunting had no very great opinion of her sister
woman so that didnt put her out Besides where ones lodger is
concerned a dislike of women is better thanwell than the other
thing

In any case where would have been the good of worrying about the
lodgers funny ways Of course Mr Sleuth was eccentric If he
hadnt been as Bunting funnily styled it just a leetle touched
upstairs he wouldnt be here living this strange solitary life
in lodgings He would be living in quite a different sort of way
with some of his relatives or with a friend of his own class

There came a time when Mrs Bunting looking backas even the
least imaginative of us are apt to look back to any part of our
own past lives which becomes for any reason poignantly memorable
wondered how soon it was that she had discovered that her
lodger was given to creeping out of the house at a time when
almost all living things prefer to sleep

She brought herself to believebut I am inclined to doubt whether
she was right in so believingthat the first time she became aware
of this strange nocturnal habit of Mr Sleuths happened to be
during the night which preceded the day on which she had observed a
very curious circumstance This very curious circumstance was the
complete disappearance of one of Mr Sleuths three suits of clothes

It always passes my comprehension how people can remember over any
length of time not every moment of certain happenings for that is
natural enough but the day the hour the minute when these
happenings took place Much as she thought about it afterwards
even Mrs Bunting never quite made up her mind whether it was during
the fifth or the sixth night of Mr Sleuths stay under her roof
that she became aware that he had gone out at two in the morning and
had only come in at five

But that there did come such a night is certainas certain as is
the fact that her discovery coincided with various occurrences
which were destined to remain retrospectively memorable



It was intensely dark intensely quietthe darkest quietest hour
of the night when suddenly Mrs Bunting was awakened from a deep
dreamless sleep by sounds at once unexpected and familiar She
knew at once what those sounds were They were those made by Mr
Sleuth first coming down the stairs and walking on tiptoeshe
was sure it was on tiptoepast her door and finally softly
shutting the front door behind him

Try as she would Mrs Bunting found it quite impossible to go to
sleep again There she lay wide awake afraid to move lest Bunting
should waken up too till she heard Mr Sleuth three hours later
creep back into the house and so up to bed

Then and not till then she slept again But in the morning she
felt very tired so tired indeed that she had been very glad when
Bunting goodnaturedly suggested that he should go out and do their
little bit of marketing

The worthy couple had very soon discovered that in the matter of
catering it was not altogether an easy matter to satisfy Mr Sleuth
and that though he always tried to appear pleased This perfect
lodger had one serious fault from the point of view of those who
keep lodgings Strange to say he was a vegetarian He would not
eat meat in any form He sometimes however condescended to a
chicken and when he did so condescend he generously intimated that
Mr and Mrs Bunting were welcome to a share in it

Now todaythis day of which the happenings were to linger in Mrs
Buntings mind so very long and to remain so very vivid it had
been arranged that Mr Sleuth was to have some fish for his lunch
while what he left was to be done up to serve for his simple supper

Knowing that Bunting would be out for at least an hour for he was
a gregarious soul and liked to have a gossip in the shops he
frequented Mrs Bunting rose and dressed in a leisurely manner
then she went and did her front sittingroom

She felt languid and dull as one is apt to feel after a broken
night and it was a comfort to her to know that Mr Sleuth was not
likely to ring before twelve

But long before twelve a loud ring suddenly clanged through the
quiet house She knew it for the front door bell

Mrs Bunting frowned No doubt the ring betokened one of those
tiresome people who come round for old bottles and suchlike
fallals

She went slowly reluctantly to the door And then her face cleared
for it was that good young chap Joe Chandler who stood waiting
outside

He was breathing a little hard as if he had walked overquickly
through the moist foggy air

Why Joe said Mrs Bunting wonderingly Come indo Buntings
out but he wont be very long now Youve been quite a stranger
these last few days

Well you know why Mrs Bunting

She stared at him for a moment wondering what he could mean Then
suddenly she remembered Why of course Joe was on a big job just
nowthe job of trying to catch The Avenger Her husband had
alluded to the fact again and again when reading out to her little
bits from the halfpenny evening paper he was taking again

She led the way to the sittingroom It was a good thing Bunting
had insisted on lighting the fire before he went out for now the
room was nice and warmand it was just horrible outside She had
felt a chill go right through her as she had stood even for that
second at the front door

And she hadnt been alone to feel it for I say it is jolly to
be in here out of that awful cold exclaimed Chandler sitting
down heavily in Buntings easy chair

And then Mrs Bunting bethought herself that the young man was tired
as well as cold He was pale almost pallid under his usual healthy
tanned complexionthe complexion of the man who lives much out of
doors

Wouldnt you like me just to make you a cup of tea she said
solicitously

Well to tell truth I should be right down thankful for one Mrs
Bunting Then he looked round and again he said her name Mrs
Bunting

He spoke in so odd so thick a tone that she turned quickly Yes
what is it Joe she asked And then in sudden terror Youve
never come to tell me that anythings happened to Bunting Hes
not had an accident

Goodness no Whatever made you think that Butbut Mrs
Bunting theres been another of them

His voice dropped almost to a whisper He was staring at her with
unhappy it seemed to her terrorfilled eyes

Another of them She looked at him bewilderedat a loss
And then what he meant flashed across heranother of them
meant another of these strange mysterious awful murders

But her relief for the moment was so greatfor she really had
thought for a second that he had come to give her ill news of
Buntingthat the feeling that she did experience on hearing
this piece of news was actually pleasurable though she would
have been much shocked had that fact been brought to her notice

Almost in spite of herself Mrs Bunting had become keenly interested
in the amazing series of crimes which was occupying the imagination
of the whole of Londons netherworld Even her refined mind had
busied itself for the last two or three days with the strange problem
so frequently presented to it by Buntingfor Bunting now that they
were no longer worried took an open unashamed intense interest in
The Avenger and his doings

She took the kettle off the gasring Its a pity Bunting isnt
here she said drawing in her breath Hed aliked so much to
hear you tell all about it Joe

As she spoke she was pouring boiling water into a little teapot

But Chandler said nothing and she turned and glanced at him Why
you do look bad she exclaimed

And indeed the young fellow did look badvery bad indeed

I cant help it he said with a kind of gasp It was your
saying that about my telling you all about it that made me turn
queer You see this time I was one of the first there and it
fairly turned me sickthat it did Oh it was too awful Mrs
Bunting Dont talk of it

He began gulping down the hot tea before it was well made

She looked at him with sympathetic interest Why Joe she said
I never would have thought with all the horrible sights you see
that anything could upset you like that

This isnt like anything theres ever been before he said And
thenthenoh Mrs Bunting twas I that discovered the piece of
paper this time

Then it is true she cried eagerly It is The Avengers bit of
paper Bunting always said it was He never believed in that
practical joker

I did said Chandler reluctantly You see there are some queer
fellows eveneven he lowered his voice and looked round him
as if the walls had earseven in the Force Mrs Bunting and
these murders have fair got on our nerves

No never she said Dyou think that a Bobby might do a thing
like that

He nodded impatiently as if the question wasnt worth answering
Then It was all along of that bit of paper and my finding it while
the poor soul was still warmhe shudderedthat brought me out
West this morning One of our bosses lives close by in Prince
Albert Terrace and I had to go and tell him all about it They
never offered me a bit or a supI think they might have done that
dont you Mrs Bunting

Yes she said absently Yes I do think so

But there I dont know that I ought to say that went on Chandler
He had me up in his dressingroom and was very consideratelike to
me while I was telling him

Have a bit of something now she said suddenly

Oh no I couldnt eat anything he said hastily I dont feel
as if I could ever eat anything any more

Thatll only make you ill Mrs Bunting spoke rather crossly
for she was a sensible woman And to please her he took a bite
out of the slice of breadandbutter she had cut for him

I expect youre right he said And Ive a goodish heavy day
in front of me Been up since four too

Four she said Was it then they found she hesitated a
moment and then said it

He nodded It was just a chance I was near by If Id been half
a minute sooner either I or the officer who found her must have
knocked up against thatthat monster But two or three people
do think they saw him slinking away

What was he like she asked curiously

Well thats hard to answer You see there was such an awful
fog But theres one thing they all agree about He was carrying
a bag

A bag repeated Mrs Bunting in a low voice Whatever sort of
bag might it have been Joe

There had come across herjust right in her middle likesuch a
strange sensation a curious kind of tremor or fluttering

She was at a loss to account for it

Just a handbag said Joe Chandler vaguely A woman I spoke to
crossexamining her likewho was positive she had seen him
said Just a tall thin shadowthats what he was a tall thin
shadow of a manwith a bag

With a bag repeated Mrs Bunting absently How very strange
and peculiar

Why no not strange at all He has to carry the thing he does
the deed with in something Mrs Bunting Weve always wondered how
he hid it They generally throws the knife or firearms away you
know

Do they indeed Mrs Bunting still spoke in that absent wondering
way She was thinking that she really must try and see what the
lodger had done with his bag It was possiblein fact when one
came to think of it it was very probablethat he had just lost
it being so forgetful a gentleman on one of the days he had gone
out as she knew he was fond of doing into the Regents Park

Therell be a description circulated in an hour or two went on
Chandler Perhaps thatll help catch him There isnt a London
man or woman I dont suppose who wouldnt give a good bit to lay
that chap by the heels Well I suppose I must be going now

Wont you wait a bit longer for Bunting she said hesitatingly

No I cant do that But Ill come in maybe either this evening
or tomorrow and tell you any more thats happened Thanks kindly
for the tea Its made a man of me Mrs Bunting

Well youve had enough to unman you Joe

Aye that I have he said heavily

A few minutes later Bunting did come in and he and his wife had
quite a little tiffthe first tiff they had had since Mr Sleuth
became their lodger

It fell out this way When he heard who had been there Bunting
was angry that Mrs Bunting hadnt got more details of the horrible
occurrence which had taken place that morning out of Chandler

You dont mean to say Ellen that you cant even tell me where it
happened he said indignantly I suppose you put Chandler off
thats what you did Why whatever did he come here for
excepting to tell us all about it

He came to have something to eat and drink snapped out Mrs
Bunting Thats what the poor lad came for if you wants to know
He could hardly speak of it at allhe felt so bad In fact he
didnt say a word about it until hed come right into the room and
sat down He told me quite enough

Didnt he tell you if the piece of paper on which the murderer had
written his name was square or threecornered demanded Bunting

No he did not And that isnt the sort of thing I should have
cared to ask him

The more fool you And then he stopped abruptly The newsboys
were coming down the Marylebone Road shouting out the awful
discovery which had been made that morningthat of The Avengers
fifth murder Bunting went out to buy a paper and his wife took
the things he had brought in down to the kitchen

The noise the newspapersellers made outside had evidently wakened
Mr Sleuth for his landlady hadnt been in the kitchen ten minutes
before his bell rang



CHAPTER VI

Mr Sleuths bell rang again

Mr Sleuths breakfast was quite ready but for the first time since
he had been her lodger Mrs Bunting did not answer the summons at
once But when there came the second imperative tinklefor
electric bells had not been fitted into that oldfashioned house
she made up her mind to go upstairs

As she emerged into the hall from the kitchen stairway Bunting
sitting comfortably in their parlour heard his wife stepping heavily
under the load of the wellladen tray

Wait a minute he called out Ill help you Ellen and he came
out and took the tray from her

She said nothing and together they proceeded up to the drawingroom
floor landing

There she stopped him Here she whispered quickly you give me
that Bunting The lodger wont like your going in to him And
then as he obeyed her and was about to turn downstairs again she
added in a rather acid tone You might open the door for me at
any rate How can I manage to do it with this here heavy tray on
my hands

She spoke in a queer jerky way and Bunting felt surprisedrather
put out Ellen wasnt exactly what youd call a lively jolly woman
but when things were going wellas nowshe was generally equable
enough He supposed she was still resentful of the way he had
spoken to her about young Chandler and the new Avenger murder

However he was always for peace so he opened the drawingroom door
and as soon as he had started going downstairs Mrs Bunting walked
into the room

And then at once there came over her the queerest feeling of relief
of lightness of heart

As usual the lodger was sitting at his old place reading the Bible

Somehowshe could not have told you why she would not willingly
have told herselfshe had expected to see Mr Sleuth looking
different But no he appeared to be exactly the samein fact
as he glanced up at her a pleasanter smile than usual lighted up
his thin pallid face

Well Mrs Bunting he said genially I overslept myself this
morning but I feel all the better for the rest

Im glad of that sir she answered in a low voice One of the
ladies I once lived with used to say Rest is an oldfashioned
remedy but its the best remedy of all

Mr Sleuth himself removed the Bible and Crudens Concordance off
the table out of her way and then he stood watching his landlady
laying the cloth

Suddenly he spoke again He was not often so talkative in the
morning I think Mrs Bunting that there was someone with you
outside the door just now

Yes sir Bunting helped me up with the tray

Im afraid I give you a good deal of trouble he said hesitatingly

But she answered quickly Oh no sir Not at all sir I was
only saying yesterday that weve never had a lodger that gave us as
little trouble as you do sir

Im glad of that I am aware that my habits are somewhat peculiar

He looked at her fixedly as if expecting her to give some sort of
denial to this observation But Mrs Bunting was an honest and
truthful woman It never occurred to her to question his statement
Mr Sleuths habits were somewhat peculiar Take that going out at
night or rather in the early morning for instance So she remained
silent

After she had laid the lodgers breakfast on the table she prepared
to leave the room I suppose Im not to do your room till you goes
out sir

And Mr Sleuth looked up sharply No no he said I never
want my room done when I am engaged in studying the Scriptures Mrs
Bunting But I am not going out today I shall be carrying out a
somewhat elaborate experimentupstairs If I go out at all he
waited a moment and again he looked at her fixedly I shall wait
till nighttime to do so And then coming back to the matter in
hand he added hastily Perhaps you could do my room when I go
upstairs about five oclockif that time is convenient to you
that is

Oh yes sir Thatll do nicely

Mrs Bunting went downstairs and as she did so she took herself
wordlessly ruthlessly to task but she did not faceeven in her
inmost heartthe strange tenors and tremors which had so shaken
her She only repeated to herself again and again Ive got upset
thats what Ive done and then she spoke aloud I must get
myself a dose at the chemists next time Im out Thats what I
must do

And just as she murmured the word do there came a loud double
knock on the front door

It was only the postmans knock but the postman was an unfamiliar
visitor in that house and Mrs Bunting started violently She was
nervous thats what was the matter with herso she told herself
angrily No doubt this was a letter for Mr Sleuth the lodger must
have relations and acquaintances somewhere in the world All
gentlefolk have But when she picked the small envelope off the
hall floor she saw it was a letter from Daisy her husbands daughter

Bunting she called out sharply Heres a letter for you

She opened the door of their sittingroom and looked in Yes there
was her husband sitting back comfortably in his easy chair reading
a paper And as she saw his broad rather rounded back Mrs Bunting
felt a sudden thrill of sharp irritation There he was doing
nothingin fact doing worse than nothingwasting his time
reading all about those horrid crimes

She sigheda long unconscious sigh Bunting was getting into
idle ways bad ways for a man of his years But how could she
prevent it He had been such an active conscientious sort of man
when they had first made acquaintance  

She also could remember even more clearly than Bunting did himself
that first meeting of theirs in the diningroom of No 90 Cumberland
Terrace As she had stood there pouring out her mistresss glass of
port wine she had not been too much absorbed in her task to have a
good outofhereye look at the spruce nice respectablelooking
fellow who was standing over by the window How superior he had
appeared even then to the man she already hoped he would succeed as
butler

Today perhaps because she was not feeling quite herself the past
rose before her very vividly and a lump came into her throat

Putting the letter addressed to her husband on the table she closed
the door softly and went down into the kitchen there were various
little things to put away and clean up as well as their dinner to
cook And all the time she was down there she fixed her mind
obstinately determinedly on Bunting and on the problem of Bunting
She wondered what shed better do to get him into good ways again

Thanks to Mr Sleuth their outlook was now moderately bright A
week ago everything had seemed utterly hopeless It seemed as if
nothing could save them from disaster But everything was now
changed

Perhaps it would be well for her to go and see the new proprietor
of that registry office in Baker Street which had lately changed
hands It would be a good thing for Bunting to get even an
occasional jobfor the matter of that he could now take up a
fairly regular thing in the way of waiting Mrs Bunting knew that
it isnt easy to get a man out of idle ways once he has acquired
those ways

When at last she went upstairs again she felt a little ashamed of
what she had been thinking for Bunting had laid the cloth and laid
it very nicely too and brought up the two chairs to the table

Ellen he cried eagerly heres news Daisys coming tomorrow
Theres scarlet fever in their house Old Aunt thinks shed better
come away for a few days So you see shell be here for her
birthday Eighteen thats what she be on the nineteenth It do
make me feel oldthat it do

Mrs Bunting put down the tray I cant have the girl here just
now she said shortly Ive just as much to do as I can manage
The lodger gives me more trouble than you seem to think for

Rubbish he said sharply Ill help you with the lodger Its
your own fault you havent had help with him before Of course
Daisy must come here Whatever other place could the girl go to

Bunting felt pugnaciousso cheerful as to be almost lighthearted
But as he looked across at his wife his feeling of satisfaction
vanished Ellens face was pinched and drawn today she looked ill
ill and horribly tired It was very aggravating of her to go and
behave like thisjust when they were beginning to get on nicely
again

For the matter of that he said suddenly Daisyll be able to help
you with the work Ellen and shell brisk us both up a bit

Mrs Bunting made no answer She sat down heavily at the table
And then she said languidly You might as well show me the girls
letter

He handed it across to her and she read it slowly to herself

DEAR FATHER it ranI hope this finds you as well at it leaves
me Mrs Puddles youngest has got scarlet fever and Aunt thinks
I had better come away at once just to stay with you for a few
days Please tell Ellen I wont give her no trouble Ill start
at ten if I dont hear nothingYour loving daughter


Yes I suppose Daisy will have to come here Mrs Bunting slowly
Itll do her good to have a bit of work to do for once in her life

And with that ungraciously worded permission Bunting had to content
himself



Quietly the rest of that eventful day sped by When dusk fell Mr
Sleuths landlady heard him go upstairs to the top floor She
remembered that this was the signal for her to go and do his room

He was a tidy man was the lodger he did not throw his things
about as so many gentlemen do leaving them all over the place
No he kept everything scrupulously tidy His clothes and the
various articles Mrs Bunting had bought for him during the first
two days he had been there were carefully arranged in the chest
of drawers He had lately purchased a pair of boots Those he
had arrived in were peculiarlooking footgear buff leather shoes
with rubber soles and he had told his landlady on that very first
day that he never wished them to go down to be cleaned

A funny ideaa funny habit that of going out for a walk after
midnight in weather so cold and foggy that all other folk were
glad to be at home snug in bed But then Mr Sleuth himself
admitted that he was a funny sort of gentleman

After she had done his bedroom the landlady went into the
sittingroom and gave it a good dusting This room was not kept
quite as nice as she would have liked it to be Mrs Bunting
longed to give the drawingroom something of a good turn out but
Mr Sleuth disliked her to be moving about in it when he himself
was in his bedroom and when up he sat there almost all the time
Delighted as he had seemed to be with the top room he only used
it when making his mysterious experiments and never during the
daytime

And now this afternoon she looked at the rosewood chiffonnier with
longing eyesshe even gave that pretty little piece of furniture
a slight shake If only the doors would fly open as the locked
doors of old cupboards sometimes do even after they have been
securely fastened how pleased she would be how much more
comfortable somehow she would feel

But the chiffonnier refused to give up its secret



About eight oclock on that same evening Joe Chandler came in just
for a few minutes chat He had recovered from his agitation of the
morning but he was full of eager excitement and Mrs Bunting
listened in silence intensely interested in spite of herself while
he and Bunting talked

Yes he said Im as right as a trivet now Ive had a good rest
laid down all this afternoon You see the Yard thinks theres
going to be something on tonight Hes always done them in pairs

So he has exclaimed Bunting wonderingly So he has Now I
never thought o that Then you think Joe that the monsterll be
on the job again tonight

Chandler nodded Yes And I think theres a very good chance of
his being caught too

I suppose therell be a lot on the watch tonight eh

I should think there will be How many of our men dyou think
therell be on night duty tonight Mr Bunting

Bunting shook his head I dont know he said helplessly

I mean extra suggested Chandler in an encouraging voice

A thousand ventured Bunting

Five thousand Mr Bunting

Never exclaimed Bunting amazed

And even Mrs Bunting echoed Never incredulously

Yes that there will You see the Boss has got his monkey up
Chandler drew a foldedup newspaper out of his coat pocket Just
listen to this

The police have reluctantly to admit that they have no clue to
the perpetrators of these horrible crimes and we cannot feel any
surprise at the information that a popular attack has been organised
on the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police There is even
talk of an indignation mass meeting

What dyou think of that Thats not a pleasant thing for a
gentleman as is doing his best to read eh

Well it does seem queer that the police cant catch him now
doesnt it said Bunting argumentatively

I dont think its queer at all said young Chandler crossly
Now you just listen again Heres a bit of the truth for once
in a newspaper And slowly he read out

The detection of crime in London now resembles a game of blind
mans buff in which the detective has his hands tied and his eyes
bandaged Thus is he turned loose to hunt the murderer through
the slums of a great city

Whatever does that mean said Bunting Your hands arent tied
and your eyes arent bandaged Joe

Its metaphoricallike that its intended Mr Bunting We havent
got the same facilitiesno not a quarter of themthat the
French tecs have

And then for the first time Mrs Bunting spoke What was that
word Joeperpetrators I mean that first bit you read out

Yes he said turning to her eagerly

Then do they think theres more than one of them she said and
a look of relief came over her thin face

Theres some of our chaps thinks its a gang said Chandler
They say it cant be the work of one man

What do you think Joe

Well Mrs Bunting I dont know what to think Im fair puzzled

He got up Dont you come to the door Ill shut it all right
So long See you tomorrow perhaps As he had done the other
evening Mr and Mrs Buntings visitor stopped at the door Any
news of Miss Daisy he asked casually

Yes shes coming tomorrow said her father Theyve got scarlet
fever at her place So Old Aunt thinks shed better clear out


The husband and wife went to bed early that night but Mrs Bunting
found she could not sleep She lay wide awake hearing the hours
the halfhours the quarters chime out from the belfry of the old
church close by

And then just as she was dozing offit must have been about one
oclockshe heard the sound she had half unconsciously been
expecting to hear that of the lodgers stealthy footsteps coming
down the stairs just outside her room

He crept along the passage and let himself out very very quietly

But though she tried to keep awake Mrs Bunting did not hear him
come in again for she soon fell into a heavy sleep

Oddly enough she was the first to wake the next morning odder
still it was she not Bunting who jumped out of bed and going
out into the passage picked up the newspaper which had just been
pushed through the letterbox

But having picked it up Mrs Bunting did not go back at once into
her bedroom Instead she lit the gas in the passage and leaning
up against the wall to steady herself for she was trembling with
cold and fatigue she opened the paper

Yes there was the heading she sought

The AVENGER Murders

But oh how glad she was to see the words that followed

Up to the time of going to press there is little new to report
concerning the extraordinary series of crimes which are amazing
and indeed staggering not only London but the whole civilised
world and which would seem to be the work of some womanhating
teetotal fanatic Since yesterday morning when the last of these
dastardly murders was committed no reliable clue to the perpetrator
or perpetrators has been obtained though several arrests were made
in the course of the day In every case however those arrested
were able to prove a satisfactory alibi

And then a little lower down

The excitement grows and grows It is not too much to say that
even a stranger to London would know that something very unusual
was in the air As for the place where the murder was committed
last night

Last night thought Mrs Bunting startled and then she realised
that last night in this connection meant the night before last

She began the sentence again

As for the place where the murder was committed last night all
approaches to it were still blocked up to a late hour by hundreds
of onlookers though of course nothing now remains in the way of
traces of the tragedy

Slowly and carefully Mrs Bunting folded the paper up again in its
original creases and then she stooped and put it back down on the
mat where she had found it She then turned out the gas and going
back into bed she lay down by her still sleeping husband

Anything the matter Bunting murmured and stirred uneasily
Anything the matter Ellen

She answered in a whisper a whisper thrilling with a strange
gladness No nothing Buntingnothing the matter Go to sleep
again my dear

They got up an hour later both in a happy cheerful mood Bunting
rejoiced at the thought of his daughters coming and even Daisys
stepmother told herself that it would be pleasant having the girl
about the house to help her a bit

About ten oclock Bunting went out to do some shopping He brought
back with him a nice little bit of pork for Daisys dinner and
three mincepies He even remembered to get some apples for the
sauce



CHAPTER VII

Just as twelve was striking a fourwheeler drew up to the gate

It brought Daisypinkcheeked excited laughingeyed Daisya
sight to gladden any fathers heart

Old Aunt said I was to have a cab if the weather was bad she
cried out joyously

There was a bit of a wrangle over the fare Kings Cross as all
the world knows is nothing like two miles from the Marylebone Road
but the man clamoured for one and sixpence and hinted darkly that
he had done the young lady a favour in bringing her at all

While he and Bunting were having words Daisy leaving them to it
walked up the flagged path to the door where her stepmother was
awaiting her

As they were exchanging a rather frigid kiss indeed twas a mere
peck on Mrs Buntings part there fell with startling suddenness
loud cries on the still cold air Longdrawn and wailing they
sounded strangely sad as they rose and fell across the distant roar
of traffic in the Edgware Road

Whats that exclaimed Bunting wonderingly Why whatevers
that

The cabman lowered his voice Thems acrying out that orrible
affair at Kings Cross Hes done for two of em this time Thats
what I meant when I said I might a got a better fare I wouldnt
say nothink before little missy there but folk ave been coming
from all over London the last five or six hours plenty of toffs
toobut there theres nothing to see now

What Another woman murdered last night

Bunting felt tremendously thrilled What had the five thousand
constables been about to let such a dreadful thing happen

The cabman stared at him surprised Two of em I tell yer
within a few yards of one another He avegot a nerveBut
of course they was drunk He are got a down on the drink

Have they caught him asked Bunting perfunctorily

Lord no Theyll never catch im It must ave happened hours
and hours agothey was both stone cold One each end of a little
passage what aint used no more Thats why they didnt find em
before

The hoarse cries were coming nearer and nearertwo news vendors
trying to outshout each other

Orrible discovery near Kings Cross they yelled exultingly
The Avenger again

And Bunting with his daughters large straw holdall in his hand
ran forward into the roadway and recklessly gave a boy a penny for
a halfpenny paper

He felt very much moved and excited Somehow his acquaintance with
young Joe Chandler made these murders seem a personal affair He
hoped that Chandler would come in soon and tell them all about it
as he had done yesterday morning when he Bunting had unluckily
been out

As he walked back into the little hall he heard Daisys voice
high voluble excitedgiving her stepmother a long account of
the scarlet fever case and how at first Old Aunts neighbours had
thought it was not scarlet fever at all but just nettlerash

But as Bunting pushed open the door of the sittingroom there
came a note of sharp alarm in his daughters voice and he heard
her cry Why Ellen whatever is the matter You do look bad
and his wifes muffled answer Open the windowdo

Orrible discovery near Kings Crossa clue at last yelled
the newspaperboys triumphantly

And then helplessly Mrs Bunting began to laugh She laughed
and laughed and laughed rocking herself to and fro as if in an
ecstasy of mirth

Why father whatevers the matter with her

Daisy looked quite scared

Shes in stericsthats what it is he said shortly
Ill just get the waterjug Wait a minute

Bunting felt very put out Ellen was ridiculousthats what she
was to be so easily upset

The lodgers bell suddenly pealed through the quiet house Either
that sound or maybe the threat of the waterjug had a magical
effect on Mrs Bunting She rose to her feet still shaking all
over but mentally composed

Ill go up she said a little chokingly As for you child
just run down into the kitchen Youll find a piece of pork
roasting in the oven You might start paring the apples for the
sauce

As Mrs Bunting went upstairs her legs felt as if they were made
of cotton wool She put out a trembling hand and clutched at the
banister for support But soon making a great effort over herself
she began to feel more steady and after waiting for a few moments
on the landing she knocked at the door of the drawingroom

Mr Sleuths voice answered her from the bedroom Im not well
he called out querulously I think Ive caught a chill I should
be obliged if you would kindly bring me up a cup of tea and put it
outside my door Mrs Bunting

Very well sir

Mrs Bunting turned and went downstairs She still felt queer and
giddy so instead of going into the kitchen she made the lodger his
cup of tea over her sittingroom gasring

During their midday dinner the husband and wife had a little
discussion as to where Daisy should sleep It had been settled
that a bed should be made up for her in the top back room but
Mrs Bunting saw reason to change this plan I think twould be
better if Daisy were to sleep with me Bunting and you was to
sleep upstairs

Bunting felt and looked rather surprised but he acquiesced Ellen
was probably right the girl would be rather lonely up there and
after all they didnt know much about the lodger though he seemed
a respectable gentleman enough

Daisy was a goodnatured girl she liked London and wanted to make
herself useful to her stepmother Ill wash up dont you bother to
come downstairs she said cheerfully

Bunting began to walk up and down the room His wife gave him a
furtive glance she wondered what he was thinking about

Didnt you get a paper she said at last

Yes of course I did he answered hastily But Ive put it away
I thought youd rather not look at it as youre that nervous

Again she glanced at him quickly furtively but he seemed just as
usualhe evidently meant just what he said and no more

I thought they was shouting something in the streetI mean just
before I was took bad

It was now Buntings turn to stare at his wife quickly and rather
furtively He had felt sure that her sudden attack of queerness
of hystericscall it what you mighthad been due to the shouting
outside She was not the only woman in London who had got the
Avenger murders on her nerves His morning paper said quite a lot
of women were afraid to go out alone Was it possible that the
curious way she had been taken just now had had nothing to do with
the shouts and excitement outside

Dont you know what it was they were calling out he asked slowly

Mrs Bunting looked across at him She would have given a very
great deal to be able to lie to pretend that she did not know what
those dreadful cries had portended But when it came to the point
she found she could not do so

Yes she said dully I heard a word here and there Theres
been another murder hasnt there

Two other murders he said soberly

Two Thats worse news She turned so palea sallow
greenishwhitethat Bunting thought she was again going queer

Ellen he said warningly Ellen now do have a care I cant
think whats come over you about these murders Turn your mind
away from them do We neednt talk about themnot so much
that is

But I wants to talk about them cried Mrs Bunting hysterically

The husband and wife were standing one each side of the table
the man with his back to the fire the woman with her back to the
door

Bunting staring across at his wife felt sadly perplexed and
disturbed She really did seem ill even her slight spare figure
looked shrunk For the first time so he told himself ruefully
Ellen was beginning to look her full age Her slender handsshe
had kept the pretty soft white hands of the woman who has never
done rough workgrasped the edge of the table with a convulsive
movement

Bunting didnt at all like the look of her Oh dear he said
to himself I do hope Ellen isnt going to be ill That would be
a todo just now

Tell me about it she commanded in a low voice Cant you see
Im waiting to hear Be quick now Bunting

There isnt very much to tell he said reluctantly Theres
precious little in this paper anyway But the cabman what brought
Daisy told me

Well

What I said just now Theres two of em this time and theyd
both been drinking heavily poor creatures

Was it where the others was done she asked looking at her husband
fearfully

No he said awkwardly No it wasnt Ellen It was a good bit
farther Westin fact not so very far from here Near Kings Cross
thats how the cabman knew about it you see They seems to have
been done in a passage which isnt used no more And then as he
thought his wifes eyes were beginning to look rather funny he added
hastily There thats enough for the present We shall soon be
hearing a lot more about it from Joe Chandler Hes pretty sure to
come in some time today

Then the five thousand constables werent no use said Mrs
Bunting slowly

She had relaxed her grip of the table and was standing more
upright

No use at all said Bunting briefly He is artful and no mistake
about it But wait a minute he turned and took up the paper
which he had laid aside on a chair Yes they says here that they
has a clue

A clue Bunting Mrs Bunting spoke in a soft weak dieaway
voice and again stooping somewhat she grasped the edge of the
table

But her husband was not noticing her now He was holding the paper
close up to his eyes and he read from it in a tone of considerable
satisfaction

It is gratifying to be able to state that the police at last
believe they are in possession of a clue which will lead to the
arrest of the and then Bunting dropped the paper and rushed
round the table

His wife with a curious sighing moan had slipped down on to the
floor taking with her the tablecloth as she went She lay there
in what appeared to be a dead faint And Bunting scared out of
his wits opened the door and screamed out Daisy Daisy Come
up child Ellens took bad again

And Daisy hurrying in showed an amount of sense and resource
which even at this anxious moment roused her fond fathers
admiration

Get a wet sponge Dadquick she cried a spongeand if
youve got such a thing a drop o brandy Ill see after her
And then after he had got the little medicine flask I cant think
whats wrong with Ellen said Daisy wonderingly She seemed quite
all right when I first came in She was listening interestedlike
to what I was telling her and then suddenlywell you saw how
she was took father Taint like Ellen this is it now

No he whispered No taint But you see child weve been
going through a pretty bad timeworse nor I should ever have let
you know of my dear Ellens just feeling it nowthats what it
is She didnt say nothing for Ellens a good plucked one but
its told on herits told on her

And then Mrs Bunting sitting up slowly opened her eyes and
instinctively put her hand up to her head to see if her hair was
all right

She hadnt really been quite off It would have been better for
her if she had She had simply had an awful feeling that she
couldnt stand upmore that she must fall down Buntings words
touched a most unwonted chord in the poor womans heart and the
eyes which she opened were full of tears She had not thought her
husband knew how she had suffered during those weeks of starving
and waiting

But she had a morbid dislike of any betrayal of sentiment To her
such betrayal betokened foolishness and so all she said was
Theres no need to make a fuss I only turned over a little queer
I never was right off Daisy

Pettishly she pushed away the glass in which Bunting had hurriedly
poured a little brandy I wouldnt touch such stuffno not if
I was dying she exclaimed

Putting out a languid hand she pulled herself up with the help of
the table on to her feet Go down again to the kitchen child
but there was a sob a kind of tremor in her voice

You havent been eating properly Ellenthats whats the matter
with you said Bunting suddenly Now I come to think of it you
havent eat half enough these last two days I always did sayin
old days many a time I telled youthat a woman couldnt live on
air But there you never believed me

Daisy stood looking from one to the other a shadow over her bright
pretty face Id no idea youd had such a bad time father she
said feelingly Why didnt you let me know about it I might have
got something out of Old Aunt

We didnt want anything of that sort said her stepmother hastily
But of coursewell I expect Im still feeling the worry now I
dont seem able to forget it Those days of waiting ofof
she restrained herself another moment and the word starving would
have left her lips

But everythings all right now said Bunting eagerly all right
thanks to Mr Sleuth that is

Yes repeated his wife in a low strange tone of voice Yes
were all right now and as you say Bunting its all along of
Mr Sleuth

She walked across to a chair and sat down on it Im just a little
tottery still she muttered

And Daisy looking at her turned to her father and said in a
whisper but not so low but that Mrs Bunting heard her Dont you
think Ellen ought to see a doctor father He might give her
something that would pull her round

I wont see no doctor said Mrs Bunting with sudden emphasis I
saw enough of doctors in my last place Thirtyeight doctors in ten
months did my poor missis have Just determined on having em she
was Did they save her No She died just the same Maybe a bit
sooner

She was a freak was your last mistress Ellen began Bunting
aggressively

Ellen had insisted on staying on in that place till her poor mistress
died They might have been married some months before they were
married but for that fact Bunting had always resented it

His wife smile wanly We wont have no words about that she said
and again she spoke in a softer kindlier tone than usual Daisy
If you wont go down to the kitchen again then I mustshe turned
to her stepdaughter and the girl flew out of the room

I think the child grows prettier every minute said Bunting fondly

Folks are too apt to forget that beauty is but skin deep said his
wife She was beginning to feel better But still I do agree
Bunting that Daisys well enough And she seems more willing too

I say we mustnt forget the lodgers dinner Bunting spoke
uneasily Its a bit of fish today isnt it Hadnt I better
just tell Daisy to see to it and then I can take it up to him as
youre not feeling quite the thing Ellen

Im quite well enough to take up Mr Sleuths luncheon she said
quickly It irritated her to hear her husband speak of the lodgers
dinner They had dinner in the middle of the day but Mr Sleuth
had luncheon However odd he might be Mrs Bunting never forgot
her lodger was a gentleman

After all he likes me to wait on him doesnt he I can manage
all right Dont you worry she added after a long pause



CHAPTER VIII

Perhaps because his luncheon was served to him a good deal later
than usual Mr Sleuth ate his nice piece of steamed sole upstairs
with far heartier an appetite than his landlady had eaten her nice
slice of roast pork downstairs

I hope youre feeling a little better sir Mrs Bunting had forced
herself to say when she first took in his tray

And he had answered plaintively querulously No I cant say I
feel well today Mrs Bunting I am tiredvery tired And as I
lay in bed I seemed to hear so many soundsso much crying and
shouting I trust the Marylebone Road is not going to become a noisy
thoroughfare Mrs Bunting

Oh no sir I dont think that Were generally reckoned very
quiet indeed sir

She waited a momenttry as she would she could not allude to what
those unwonted shouts and noises had betokened I expect youve
got a chill sir she said suddenly If I was you I shouldnt
go out this afternoon Id just stay quietly indoors Theres a lot
of rough people about Perhaps there was an undercurrent of
warning of painful pleading in her toneless voice which penetrated
in some way to the brain of the lodger for Mr Sleuth looked up and
an uneasy watchful look came into his luminous grey eyes

Im sorry to hear that Mrs Bunting But I think Ill take your
advice That is I will stay quietly at home I am never at a loss
to know what to do with myself so long as I can study the Book of
Books

Then youre not afraid about your eyes sir said Mrs Bunting
curiously Somehow she was beginning to feel better It comforted
her to be up here talking to Mr Sleuth instead of thinking about
him downstairs It seemed to banish the terror which filled her
soulaye and her body tooat other times When she was with
him Mr Sleuth was so gentle so reasonable soso grateful

Poor kindly solitary Mr Sleuth This kind of gentleman surely
wouldnt hurt a fly let alone a human being Eccentricso much
must be admitted But Mrs Bunting had seen a good deal of eccentric
folk eccentric women rather than eccentric men in her long career
as useful maid

Being at ordinary times an exceptionally sensible wellbalanced
woman she had never in old days allowed her mind to dwell on
certain things she had learnt as to the aberrations of which human
nature is capableeven wellborn wellnurtured gentle human
natureas exemplified in some of the households where she had
served It would indeed be unfortunate if she now became morbid
oror hysterical

So it was in a sharp cheerful voice almost the voice in which she
had talked during the first few days of Mr Sleuths stay in her
house that she exclaimed Well sir Ill be up again to clear
away in about half an hour And if youll forgive me for saying so
I hope you will stay in and have a rest today Nasty muggy weather
thats what it is If theres any little thing you want me or
Bunting can go out and get it



It must have been about four oclock when there came a ring at the
front door

The three were sitting chatting together for Daisy had washed up
she really was saving her stepmother a good bit of troubleand
the girl was now amusing her elders by a funny account of Old Aunts
pernickety ways

Whoever can that be said Bunting looking up Its too early
for Joe Chandler surely

Ill go said his wife hurriedly jumping up from her chair
Ill go We dont want no strangers in here

And as she stepped down the short bit of passage she said to herself
A clue What clue

But when she opened the front door a glad sigh of relief broke from
her Why Joe We never thought twas you But youre very
welcome Im sure Come in

And Chandler came in a rather sheepish look on his goodlooking
fair young face

I thought maybe that Mr Bunting would like to know he began
in a loud cheerful voice and Mrs Bunting hurriedly checked him
She didnt want the lodger upstairs to hear what young Chandler
might be going to say

Dont talk so loud she said a little sharply The lodger is
not very well today Hes had a cold she added hastily and
during the last two or three days he hasnt been able to go out

She wondered at her temerity herher hypocrisy and that moment
those few words marked an epoch in Ellen Buntings life It was
the first time she had told a bold and deliberate lie She was
one of those womenthere are many many suchto whom there is
a whole world of difference between the suppression of the truth
and the utterance of an untruth

But Chandler paid no heed to her remarks Has Miss Daisy arrived
he asked in a lower voice

She nodded And then he went through into the room where the father
and daughter were sitting

Well said Bunting starting up Well Joe Now you can tell
us all about that mysterious clue I suppose itd be too good news
to expect you to tell us theyve caught him

No fear of such good news as that yet awhile If theyd caught
him said Joe ruefully well I dont suppose I should be here
Mr Bunting But the Yard are circulating a description at last
Andwell theyve found his weapon

No cried Bunting excitedly You dont say so Whatever sort
of a thing is it And are they sure tis his

Well taint sure but it seems to be likely

Mrs Bunting had slipped into the room and shut the door behind her
But she was still standing with her back against the door looking
at the group in front of her None of them were thinking of her
she thanked God for that She could hear everything that was
said without joining in the talk and excitement

Listen to this cried Joe Chandler exultantly Taint given
out yetnot for the public that isbut we was all given it by
eight oclock this morning Quick work that eh He read out


 WANTED

 A man of age approximately 28 slight in figure height
 approximately 5 ft 8 in Complexion dark No beard or
 whiskers Wearing a black diagonal coat hard felt hat high
 white collar and tie Carried a newspaper parcel Very
 respectable appearance


Mrs Bunting walked forward She gave a long fluttering sigh of
unutterable relief

Theres the chap said Joe Chandler triumphantly And now Miss
Daisyhe turned to her jokingly but there was a funny little
tremor in his frank cheerfulsounding voiceif you knows of any
nice likely young fellow that answers to that descriptionwell
youve only got to walk in and earn your reward of five hundred
pounds

Five hundred pounds cried Daisy and her father simultaneously

Yes Thats what the Lord Mayor offered yesterday Some private
blokenothing official about it But we of the Yard is barred
from taking that reward worse luck And its too bad for we has
all the trouble after all

Just hand that bit of paper over will you said Bunting Id
like to con it over to myself

Chandler threw over the bit of flimsy

A moment later Bunting looked up and handed it back Well its
clear enough isnt it

Yes And theres hundredsnay thousandsof young fellows
that might be a description of said Chandler sarcastically As
a pal of mine said this morning There isnt a chap will like to
carry a newspaper parcel after this And it wont do to have a
respectable appearanceeh

Daisys voice rang out in merry pealing laughter She greatly
appreciated Mr Chandlers witticism

Why on earth didnt the people who saw him try and catch him
asked Bunting suddenly

And Mrs Bunting broke in in a lower voice Yes Joethat seems
odd dont it

Joe Chandler coughed Well its this way he said No one
person did see all that The man whos described here is just made
up from the description of two different folk who think they saw
him You see the murders must have taken placewell now let
me seeperhaps at two oclock this last time Two oclock
thats the idea Well at such a time as that not many people are
about especially on a foggy night Yes one woman declares she
saw a young chap walking away from the spot where twas done and
another onebut that was a good bit latersays The Avenger
passed by her Its mostly her theyre following in this ere
description And then the boss who has charge of that sort of
thing looked up what other people had saidI mean when the other
crimes was committed Thats how he made up this Wanted

Then The Avenger may be quite a different sort of man said
Bunting slowly disappointedly

Well of course he may be But no I think that description
fits him all right said Chandler but he also spoke in a
hesitating voice

You was saying Joe that they found a weapon observed Bunting
insinuatingly

He was glad that Ellen allowed the discussion to go onin fact
that she even seemed to take an intelligent interest in it She
had come up close to them and now looked quite her old self again

Yes They believe theyve found the weapon what he does his awful
deeds with said Chandler At any rate within a hundred yards
of that little dark passage where they found the bodiesone at
each end that wasthere was discovered this morning a very
peculiar kind o knifekeen as a razor pointed as a dagger
thats the exact words the boss used when he was describing it to
a lot of us He seemed to think a lot more of that clue than of
the otherI mean than of the description people gave of the chap
who walked quickly by with a newspaper parcel But now theres a
pretty job in front of us Every shop where they sell or might a
sold such a thing as that knife including every eatinghouse in
the East End has got to be called at

Whatever for asked Daisy

Why with an idea of finding out if anyone saw such a knife fooling
about there any time and if so in whose possession it was at the
time But Mr BuntingChandlers voice changed it became
businesslike officialtheyre not going to say anything about
thatnot in newspaperstill tomorrow so dont you go and
tell anybody You see we dont want to frighten the fellow off
If he knew theyd got his knifewell he might just make himself
scarce and they dont want that If its discovered that any knife
of that kind was sold say a month ago to some customer whose ways
are known thenthen

Whatll happen then said Mrs Bunting coming nearer

Well then nothingll be put about it in the papers at all said
Chandler deliberately The only objec of letting the public know
about it would be if nothink was foundI mean if the search of
the shops and so on was no good Then of course we must try
and find out someonesome private personlike whos watched that
knife in the criminals possession Its there the rewardthe
five hundred pounds will come in

Oh Id give anything to see that knife exclaimed Daisy clasping
her hands together

You cruel bloodthirsty girl cried her stepmother passionately

They all looked round at her surprised

Come come Ellen said Bunting reprovingly

Well it is a horrible idea said his wife sullenly To go and
sell a fellowbeing for five hundred pounds

But Daisy was offended Of course Id like to see it she cried
defiantly I never said nothing about the reward That was Mr
Chandler said that I only said Id like to see the knife

Chandler looked at her soothingly Well the day may come when
you will see it he said slowly

A great idea had come into his mind

No What makes you think that

If they catches him and if you comes along with me to see our
Black Museum at the Yard youll certainly see the knife Miss Daisy
They keeps all them kind of things there So if as I say this
weapon should lead to the conviction of The Avengerwell then
that knife ull be there and youll see it

The Black Museum Why whatever do they have a museum in your
place for asked Daisy wonderingly I thought there was only the
British Museum

And then even Mrs Bunting as well as Bunting and Chandler
laughed aloud

You are a goosey girl said her father fondly Why theres a
lot of museums in London the towns thick with em Ask Ellen
there She and me used to go to them kind of places when we was
courtingif the weather was bad

But our museums the one that would interest Miss Daisy broke in
Chandler eagerly Its a regular Chamber of Orrors

Why Joe you never told us about that place before said Bunting
excitedly Dyou really mean that theres a museum where they
keeps all sorts of things connected with crimes Things like knives
murders have been committed with

Knives cried Joe pleased at having become the centre of
attention for Daisy had also fixed her blue eyes on him and even
Mrs Bunting looked at him expectantly Much more than knives Mr
Bunting Why theyve got there in little bottles the real poison
what people have been done away with

And can you go there whenever you like asked Daisy wonderingly
She had not realised before what extraordinary and agreeable
privileges are attached to the position of a detective member of
the London Police Force

Well I suppose I could Joe smiled Anyway I can certainly
get leave to take a friend there He looked meaningly at Daisy
and Daisy looked eagerly at him

But would Ellen ever let her go out by herself with Mr Chandler
Ellen was so prim soso irritatingly proper But what was this
father was saying Dyou really mean that Joe

Yes of course I do

Well then look here If it isnt asking too much of a favour I
should like to go along there with you very much one day I dont
want to wait till The Avengers caughtBunting smiled broadly
Id be quite content as it is with what there is in that museum
o yours Ellen therehe looked across at his wifedont
agree with me about such things Yet I dont think Im a
bloodthirsty man But Im just terribly interested in all that sort
of thingalways have been I used to positively envy the butler
in that Balham Mystery

Again a look passed between Daisy and the young manit was a look
which contained and carried a great many things backwards and
forwards such asNow isnt it funny that your father should
want to go to such a place But still I cant help it if he does
want to go so we must put up with his company though it would
have been much nicer for us to go just by our two selves And
then Daisys look answered quite as plainly though perhaps Joe
didnt read her glance quite as clearly as she had read his Yes
it is tiresome But father means well and twill be very pleasant
going there even if he does come too

Well what dyou say to the day after tomorrow Mr Bunting Id
call for you here aboutshall we say halfpast twoand just
take you and Miss Daisy down to the Yard Twouldnt take very
long we could go all the way by bus right down to Westminster
Bridge He looked round at his hostess Wouldnt you join us
Mrs Bunting Tis truly a wonderful interesting place

But his hostess shook her head decidedly Twould turn me sick
she exclaimed to see the bottle of poison what had done away with
the life of some poor creature

And as for knives a look of real horror of startled fear
crept over her pale face

There there said Bunting hastily Live and let livethats
what I always say Ellen aint on in this turn She can just
stay at home and mind the catI beg his pardon I mean the lodger

I wont have Mr Sleuth laughed at said Mrs Bunting darkly
But there Im sure its very kind of you Joe to think of giving
Bunting and Daisy such a rare treatshe spoke sarcastically but
none of the three who heard her understood that



CHAPTER IX

The moment she passed though the great arched door which admits the
stranger to that portion of New Scotland Yard where throbs the heart
of that great organism which fights the forces of civilised crime
Daisy Bunting felt that she had indeed become free of the Kingdom of
Romance Even the lift in which the three of them were whirled up
to one of the upper floors of the huge building was to the girl a
new and delightful experience Daisy had always lived a simple
quiet life in the little country town where dwelt Old Aunt and this
was the first time a lift had come her way

With a touch of personal pride in the vast building Joe Chandler
marched his friends down a wide airy corridor

Daisy clung to her fathers arm a little bewildered a little
oppressed by her good fortune Her happy young voice was
stilled by the awe she felt at the wonderful place where she
found herself and by the glimpses she caught of great rooms full
of busy silent men engaged in unravellingor so she supposed
the mysteries of crime

They were passing a halfopen door when Chandler suddenly stopped
short Look in there he said in a low voice addressing the
father rather than the daughter thats the FingerPrint Room
Weve records here of over two hundred thousand mens and womens
fingertips I expect you know Mr Bunting as how once weve got
the print of a mans five fingertips well hes done forif he
ever does anything else that is Once weve got that bit of him
registered he cant never escape usno not if he tries ever so
But though theres nigh on a quarter of a million records in there
yet it dont takewell not half an hour for them to tell
whether any particular man has ever been convicted before Wonderful
thought aint it

Wonderful said Bunting drawing a deep breath And then a
troubled look came over his stolid face Wonderful but also a
very fearful thought for the poor wretches as has got their
fingerprints in Joe

Joe laughed Agreed he said And the cleverer ones knows that
only too well Why not long ago one man who knew his record was
here safe managed to slash about his fingers something awful just
so as to make a blurred impressionyou takes my meaning But
there at the end of six weeks the skin grew all right again and
in exactly the same little creases as before

Poor devil said Bunting under his breath and a cloud even came
over Daisys bright eager face

They were now going along a narrower passage and then again they
came to a halfopen door leading into a room far smaller than
that of the FingerPrint Identification Room

If youll glance in there said Joe briefly youll see how we
finds out all about any man whose fingertips has given him away so
to speak Its here we keeps an account of what hes done his
previous convictions and so on His fingertips are where I told
you and his record in therejust connected by a number

Wonderful said Bunting drawing in his breath But Daisy was
longing to get onto get to the Black Museum All this that Joe
and her father were saying was quite unreal to her and for the
matter of that not worth taking the trouble to understand However
she had not long to wait

A broadshouldered pleasantlooking young fellow who seemed on
very friendly terms with Joe Chandler came forward suddenly and
unlocking a commonplacelooking door ushered the little party of
three through into the Black Museum

For a moment there came across Daisy a feeling of keen disappointment
and surprise This big light room simply reminded her of what they
called the Science Room in the public library of the town where she
lived with Old Aunt Here as there the centre was taken up with
plain glass cases fixed at a height from the floor which enabled
their contents to be looked at closely

She walked forward and peered into the case nearest the door The
exhibits shown there were mostly small shabbylooking little things
the sort of things one might turn out of an old rubbish cupboard in
an untidy houseold medicine bottles a soiled neckerchief what
looked like a childs broken lantern even a box of pills  

As for the walls they were covered with the queerestlooking
objects bits of old iron oddlooking things made of wood and
leather and so on

It was really rather disappointing

Then Daisy Bunting gradually became aware that standing on a shelf
just below the first of the broad spacious windows which made the
great room look so light and shadowless was a row of lifesize
white plaster heads each head slightly inclined to the right
There were about a dozen of these not moreand they had such odd
staring helpless reallooking faces

Whatevers those asked Bunting in a low voice

Daisy clung a thought closer to her fathers arm Even she guessed
that these strange pathetic staring faces were the deathmasks of
those men and women who had fulfilled the awful law which ordains
that the murderer shall be in his turn done to death

All hanged said the guardian of the Black Museum briefly Casts
taken after death

Bunting smiled nervously They dont look dead somehow They
looks more as if they were listening he said

Thats the fault of Jack Ketch said the man facetiously Its
his ideathat of knotting his patients necktie under the left
ear Thats what he does to each of the gentlemen to whom he has
to act valet on just one occasion only It makes them lean just a
bit to one side You look here

Daisy and her father came a little closer and the speaker pointed
with his finger to a little dent imprinted on the left side of each
neck running from this indentation was a curious little furrow
well ridged above showing how tightly Jack Ketchs necktie had been
drawn when its wearer was hurried through the gates of eternity

They looks foolishlike rather than terrified oror hurt said
Bunting wonderingly

He was extraordinarily moved and fascinated by those dumb staring
faces

But young Chandler exclaimed in a cheerful matteroffact voice
Well a man would look foolish at such a time as that with all his
plans brought to naughtand knowing hes only got a second to live
now wouldnt he

Yes I suppose he would said Bunting slowly

Daisy had gone a little pale The sinister breathless atmosphere
of the place was beginning to tell on her She now began to
understand that the shabby little objects lying there in the glass
case close to her were each and all links in the chain of evidence
which in almost every case had brought some guilty man or woman
to the gallows

We had a yellow gentleman here the other day observed the guardian
suddenly one of those Brahminsso they calls themselves Well
youd a been quite surprised to see how that heathen took on He
declaredwhat was the word he usedhe turned to Chandler

He said that each of these things with the exception of the casts
mind youqueer to say he left them outexuded evil that was
the word he used Exudedsqueezed out it means He said that
being here made him feel very bad And twasnt all nonsense either
He turned quite green under his yellow skin and we had to shove him
out quick He didnt feel better till hed got right to the other
end of the passage

There now Whod ever think of that said Bunting I should say
that man ud got something on his conscience wouldnt you

Well I neednt stay now said Joes goodnatured friend You
show your friends round Chandler You knows the place nearly as
well as I do dont you

He smiled at Joes visitors as if to say goodbye but it seemed
that he could not tear himself away after all

Look here he said to Bunting In this here little case are the
tools of Charles Peace I expect youve heard of him

I should think I have cried Bunting eagerly

Many gents as comes here thinks this case the most interesting of
all Peace was such a wonderful man A great inventor they say he
would have been had he been put in the way of it Heres his
ladder you see it folds up quite compactly and makes a nice little
bundlejust like a bundle of old sticks any man might have been
seen carrying about London in those days without attracting any
attention Why it probably helped him to look like an honest
working man time and time again for on being arrested he declared
most solemnly hed always carried that ladder openly under his arm

The daring of that cried Bunting

Yes and when the ladder was opened out it could reach from the
ground to the second storey of any old house And oh how clever
he was Just open one section and you see the other sections open
automatically so Peace could stand on the ground and force the
thing quietly up to any window he wished to reach Then hed go
away again having done his job with a mere bundle of old wood
under his arm My word he was artful I wonder if youve heard
the tale of how Peace once lost a finger Well he guessed the
constables were instructed to look out for a man missing a finger
so what did he do

Put on a false finger suggested Bunting

No indeed Peace made up his mind just to do without a hand
altogether Heres his false stump you see its made of wood
wood and black felt Well that just held his hand nicely
Why we considers that one of the most ingenious contrivances in
the whole museum

Meanwhile Daisy had let go her hold of her father With Chandler
in delighted attendance she had moved away to the farther end of
the great room and now she was bending over yet another glass case
Whatever are those little bottles for she asked wonderingly

There were five small phials filled with varying quantities of
cloudy liquids

Theyre full of poison Miss Daisy thats what they are Theres
enough arsenic in that little whack o brandy to do for you and me
aye and for your father as well I should say

Then chemists shouldnt sell such stuff said Daisy smiling
Poison was so remote from herself that the sight of these little
bottles only brought a pleasant thrill

No more they dont That was sneaked out of a flypaper that was
Lady said she wanted a cosmetic for her complexion but what she was
really going for was flypapers for to do away with her husband
Shed got a bit tired of him I suspect

Perhaps he was a horrid man and deserved to be done away with
said Daisy The idea struck them both as so very comic that they
began to laugh aloud in unison

Did you ever hear what a certain Mrs Pearce did asked Chandler
becoming suddenly serious

Oh yes said Daisy and she shuddered a little That was the
wicked wicked woman what killed a pretty little baby and its mother
Theyve got her in Madame Tussauds But Ellen she wont let me go
to the Chamber of Horrors She wouldnt let father take me there
last time I was in London Cruel of her I called it But somehow
I dont feel as if I wanted to go there now after having been here

Well said Chandler slowly weve a case full of relics of Mrs
Pearce But the pram the bodies were found in thats at Madame
Tussaudsat least so they claim I cant say Now heres something
just as curious and not near so dreadful See that mans jacket
there

Yes said Daisy falteringly She was beginning to feel oppressed
frightened She no longer wondered that the Indian gentleman had
been taken queer

A burglar shot a man dead whod disturbed him and by mistake he
went and left that jacket behind him Our people noticed that one
of the buttons was broken in two Well that dont seem much of a
clue does it Miss Daisy Will you believe me when I tells you
that that other bit of button was discovered and that it hanged
the fellow And twas the more wonderful because all three buttons
was different

Daisy stared wonderingly down at the little broken button which
had hung a man And whatevers that she asked pointing to a
piece of dirtylooking stuff

Well said Chandler reluctantly thats rather a horrible thing
that is Thats a bit o shirt that was buried with a woman
buried in the ground I meanafter her husband had cut her up and
tried to burn her Twas that bit o shirt that brought him to the
gallows

I considers your museums a very horrid place said Daisy
pettishly turning away

She longed to be out in the passage again away from this brightly
lighted cheerfullooking sinister room

But her father was now absorbed in the case containing various types
of infernal machines Beautiful little works of art some of them
are said his guide eagerly and Bunting could not but agree

Come alongdo father said Daisy quickly Ive seen about
enough now If I was to stay in here much longer it ud give me
the horrors I dont want to have no nightmares tonight Its
dreadful to think there are so many wicked people in the world
Why we might knock up against some murderer any minute without
knowing it mightnt we

Not you Miss Daisy said Chandler smilingly I dont suppose
youll ever come across even a common swindler let alone anyone
whos committed a murdernot one in a million does that Why
even I have never had anything to do with a proper murder case

But Bunting was in no hurry He was thoroughly enjoying every
moment of the time Just now he was studying intently the various
photographs which hung on the walls of the Black Museum especially
was he pleased to see those connected with a famous and still
mysterious case which had taken place not long before in Scotland
and in which the servant of the man who died had played a
considerable partnot in elucidating but in obscuring the mystery

I suppose a good many murderers get off he said musingly

And Joe Chandlers friend nodded I should think they did he
exclaimed Theres no such thing as justice here in England
Tis odds on the murderer every time Tisnt one in ten that
come to the end he should doto the gallows that is

And what dyou think about whats going on nowI mean about
those Avenger murders

Bunting lowered his voice but Daisy and Chandler were already
moving towards the door

I dont believe hell ever be caught said the other
confidentially In some ways tis a lot more of a job to catch a
madman than tis to run down just an ordinary criminal And of
courseleastways to my thinkingThe Avenger is a madmanone
of the cunning quiet sort Have you heard about the letter his
voice dropped lower

 No said Bunting staring eagerly at him What letter dyou
mean

Well theres a letteritll be in this museum some daywhich
came just before that last double event Twas signed The Avenger
in just the same printed characters as on that bit of paper he always
leaves behind him Mind you it dont follow that it actually was The
Avenger what sent that letter here but it looks uncommonly like it
and I know that the Boss attaches quite a lot of importance to it

And where was it posted asked Bunting That might be a bit of a
clue you know

Oh no said the other They always goes a very long way to
post anythingcriminals do It stands to reason they would But
this particular one was put in the Edgware Road Post Office

What Close to us said Bunting Goodness dreadful

Any of us might knock up against him any minute I dont suppose
The Avengers in any way peculiarlookingin fact we know he aint

Then you think that woman as says she saw him did see him asked
Bunting hesitatingly

Our description was made up from what she said answered the other
cautiously But there you cant tell In a case like that its
gropinggroping in the dark all the timeand its just a lucky
accident if it comes out right in the end Of course its upsetting
us all very much here You cant wonder at that

No indeed said Bunting quickly I give you my word Ive hardly
thought of anything else for the last month

Daisy had disappeared and when her father joined her in the passage
she was listening with downcast eyes to what Joe Chandler was
saying

He was telling her about his real home of the place where his mother
lived at Richmondthat it was a nice little house close to the
park He was asking her whether she could manage to come out there
one afternoon explaining that his mother would give them tea and
how nice it would be

I dont see why Ellen shouldnt let me the girl said rebelliously
But shes that oldfashioned and pernickety is Ellena regular
old maid And you see Mr Chandler when Im staying with them
father dont like for me to do anything that Ellen dont approve of
But shes got quite fond of you so perhaps if you ask her
She looked at him and he nodded sagely

Dont you be afraid he said confidently Ill get round Mrs
Bunting But Miss Daisyhe grew very redId just like to
ask you a questionno offence meant

Yes said Daisy a little breathlessly Theres father close to
us Mr Chandler Tell me quick what is it

Well I take it by what you said just now that youve never
walked out with any young fellow

Daisy hesitated a moment then a very pretty dimple came into her
cheek No she said sadly No Mr Chandler that I have not
In a burst of candour she added You see I never had the chance

And Joe Chandler smiled well pleased



CHAPTER X

By what she regarded as a fortunate chance Mrs Bunting found
herself for close on an hour quite alone in the house during her
husbands and Daisys jaunt with young Chandler

Mr Sleuth did not often go out in the daytime but on this
particular afternoon after he had finished his tea when dusk was
falling he suddenly observed that he wanted a new suit of clothes
and his landlady eagerly acquiesced in his going out to purchase it

As soon as he had left the house she went quickly up to the
drawingroom floor Now had come her opportunity of giving the two
rooms a good dusting but Mrs Bunting knew well deep in her heart
that it was not so much the dusting of Mr Sleuths sittingroom she
wanted to doas to engage in a vague search forshe hardly knew
for what

During the years she had been in service Mrs Bunting had always
had a deep wordless contempt for those of her fellowservants who
read their employers private letters and who furtively peeped
into desks and cupboards in the hope more vague than positive of
discovering family skeletons

But now with regard to Mr Sleuth she was ready aye eager to
do herself what she had once so scorned others for doing

Beginning with the bedroom she started on a methodical search He
was a very tidy gentleman was the lodger and his few things
undergarments and so on were in applepie order She had early
undertaken much to his satisfaction to do the very little bit of
washing he required done with her own and Buntings Luckily he
wore soft shirts

At one time Mrs Bunting had always had a woman in to help her with
this tiresome weekly job but lately she had grown quite clever at
it herself The only things she had to send out were Buntings
shirts Everything else she managed to do herself

From the chest of drawers she now turned her attention to the
dressingtable

Mr Sleuth did not take his money with him when he went out he
generally left it in one of the drawers below the oldfashioned
lookingglass And now in a perfunctory way his landlady pulled
out the little drawer but she did not touch what was lying there
she only glanced at the heap of sovereigns and a few bits of silver
The lodger had taken just enough money with him to buy the clothes
he required He had consulted her as to how much they would cost
making no secret of why he was going out and the fact had vaguely
comforted Mrs Bunting

Now she lifted the toiletcover and even rolled up the carpet a
little way but no there was nothing there not so much as a scrap
of paper And at last when more or less giving up the search as
she came and went between the two rooms leaving the connecting door
wide open her mind became full of uneasy speculation and wonder as
to the lodgers past life

Odd Mr Sleuth must surely always have been but odd in a sensible
sort of way having on the whole the same moral ideals of conduct
as have other people of his class He was queer about the drinkone
might say almost crazy on the subjectbut there as to that he
wasnt the only one She Ellen Bunting had once lived with a
lady who was just like that who was quite crazed that is on the
question of drink and drunkardsShe looked round the neat
drawingroom with vague dissatisfaction There was only one place
where anything could be kept concealedthat place was the
substantial if small mahogany chiffonnier And then an idea
suddenly came to Mrs Bunting one she had never thought of before

After listening intently for a moment lest something should suddenly
bring Mr Sleuth home earlier than she expected she went to the
corner where the chiffonnier stood and exerting the whole of her
not very great physical strength she tipped forward the heavy piece
of furniture

As she did so she heard a queer rumbling soundsomething rolling
about on the second shelf something which had not been there before
Mr Sleuths arrival Slowly laboriously she tipped the chiffonnier
backwards and forwardsonce twice thricesatisfied yet strangely
troubled in her mind for she now felt sure that the bag of which the
disappearance had so surprised her was there safely locked away by
its owner

Suddenly a very uncomfortable thought came to Mrs Buntings mind
She hoped Mr Sleuth would not notice that his bag had shifted inside
the cupboard A moment later with sharp dismay Mr Sleuths
landlady realised that the fact that she had moved the chiffonnier
must become known to her lodger for a thin trickle of some
darkcoloured liquid was oozing out though the bottom of the little
cupboard door

She stooped down and touched the stuff It showed red bright red
on her finger

Mrs Bunting grew chalky white then recovered herself quickly In
fact the colour rushed into her face and she grew hot all over

It was only a bottle of red ink she had upsetthat was all How
could she have thought it was anything else

It was the more silly of herso she told herself in scornful
condemnationbecause she knew that the lodger used red ink
Certain pages of Crudens Concordance were covered with notes written
in Mr Sleuths peculiar upright handwriting In fact in some places
you couldnt see the margin so closely covered was it with remarks
and notes of interrogation

Mr Sleuth had foolishly placed his bottle of red ink in the
chiffonnierthat was what her poor foolish gentleman had done
and it was owing to her inquisitiveness her restless wish to know
things she would be none the better none the happier for knowing
that this accident had taken place

She mopped up with her duster the few drops of ink which had fallen
on the green carpet and then still feeling as she angrily told
herself foolishly upset she went once more into the back room

It was curious that Mr Sleuth possessed no notepaper She would
have expected him to have made that one of his first purchasesthe
more so that paper is so very cheap especially that rather
dirtylooking grey Silurian paper Mrs Bunting had once lived with
a lady who always used two kinds of notepaper white for her friends
and equals grey for those whom she called common people She
Ellen Green as she then was had always resented the fact Strange
she should remember it now stranger in a way because that employer
of hers had not been a real lady and Mr Sleuth whatever his
peculiarities was in every sense of the word a real gentleman
Somehow Mrs Bunting felt sure that if he had bought any notepaper
it would have been whitewhite and probably creamlaidnot
grey and cheap

Again she opened the drawer of the oldfashioned wardrobe and lifted
up the few pieces of underclothing Mr Sleuth now possessed

But there was nothing therenothing that is hidden away When
one came to think of it there seemed something strange in the notion
of leaving all ones money where anyone could take it and in locking
up such a valueless thing as a cheap sham leather bag to say nothing
of a bottle of ink

Mrs Bunting once more opened out each of the tiny drawers below the
lookingglass each delicately fashioned of fine old mahogany Mr
Sleuth kept his money in the centre drawer

The glass had only cost sevenandsixpence and after the auction
a dealer had come and offered her first fifteen shillings and then
a guinea for it Not long ago in Baker Street she had seen a
lookingglass which was the very spit of this one labeled
Chippendale Antique L21 5s 0d

There lay Mr Sleuths moneythe sovereigns as the landlady well
knew would each and all gradually pass into hers and Buntings
possession honestly earned by them no doubt but unattainablein
act unearnableexcepting in connection with the present owner of
those dully shining gold sovereigns

At last she went downstairs to await Mr Sleuths return

When she heard the key turn in the door she came out into the
passage

Im sorry to say Ive had an accident sir she said a little
breathlessly Taking advantage of your being out I went up to
dust the drawingroom and while I was trying to get behind the
chiffonnier it tilted Im afraid sir that a bottle of ink that
was inside may have got broken for just a few drops oozed out
sir But I hope theres no harm done I wiped it up as well as
I could seeing that the doors of the chiffonnier are locked

Mr Sleuth stared at her with a wild almost a terrified glance
But Mrs Bunting stood her ground She felt far less afraid now
than she had felt before he came in Then she had been so
frightened that she had nearly gone out of the house on to the
pavement for company

Of course I had no idea sir that you kept any ink in there

She spoke as if she were on the defensive and the lodgers brow
cleared

I was aware you used ink sir Mrs Bunting went on for I have
seen you marking that book of yoursI mean the book you read
together with the Bible Would you like me to go out and get you
another bottle sir

No said Mr Sleuth No I thank you I will at once proceed
upstairs and see what damage has been done When I require you I
shall ring

He shuffled past her and five minutes later the drawingroom bell
did ring

At once from the door Mrs Bunting saw that the chiffonnier was
wide open and that the shelves were empty save for the bottle of
red ink which had turned over and now lay in a red pool of its own
making on the lower shelf

Im afraid it will have stained the wood Mrs Bunting Perhaps I
was illadvised to keep my ink in there

Oh no sir That doesnt matter at all Only a drop or two fell
out on to the carpet and they dont show as you see sir for its
a dark corner Shall I take the bottle away I may as well

Mr Sleuth hesitated No he said after a long pause I think
not Mrs Bunting For the very little I require it the ink
remaining in the bottle will do quite well especially if I add a
little water or better still a little tea to what already
remains in the bottle I only require it to mark up passages which
happen to be of peculiar interest in my Concordancea work Mrs
Bunting which I should have taken great pleasure in compiling
myself had not thisahthis gentleman called Cruden been before



Not only Bunting but Daisy also thought Ellen far pleasanter in
her manner than usual that evening She listened to all they had
to say about their interesting visit to the Black Museum and did
not snub either of themno not even when Bunting told of the
dreadful haunting sillylooking deathmasks taken from the hanged

But a few minutes after that when her husband suddenly asked her
a question Mrs Bunting answered at random It was clear she had
not heard the last few words he had been saying

A penny for your thoughts he said jocularly But she shook her
head

Daisy slipped out of the room and five minutes later came back
dressed up in a blueandwhite check silk gown

My said her father You do look fine Daisy Ive never seen
you wearing that before

And a rare figure of fun she looks in it observed Mrs Bunting
sarcastically And then I suppose this dressing up means that
youre expecting someone I should have thought both of you must
have seen enough of young Chandler for one day I wonder when that
young chap does his workthat I do He never seems too busy to
come and waste an hour or two here

But that was the only nasty thing Ellen said all that evening And
even Daisy noticed that her stepmother seemed dazed and unlike
herself She went about her cooking and the various little things
she had to do even more silently than was her wont

Yet under that still almost sullen manner how fierce was the
storm of dread of sombre anguish and yes of sick suspense
which shook her soul and which so far affected her poor ailing
body that often she felt as if she could not force herself to
accomplish her simple round of daily work

After they had finished supper Bunting went out and bought a penny
evening paper but as he came in he announced with a rather rueful
smile that he had read so much of that nasty little print this
last week or two that his eyes hurt him

Let me read aloud a bit to you father said Daisy eagerly and he
handed her the paper

Scarcely had Daisy opened her lips when a loud ring and a knock
echoed through the house



CHAPTER XI

It was only Joe Somehow even Bunting called him Joe now and no
longer Chandler as he had mostly used to do

Mrs Bunting had opened the front door only a very little way
She wasnt going to have any strangers pushing in past her

To her sharpened suffering senses her house had become a citadel
which must be defended aye even if the besiegers were a mighty
horde with right on their side And she was always expecting that
first single spy who would herald the battalion against whom her
only weapon would be her womans wit and cunning

But when she saw who stood there smiling at her the muscles of her
face relaxed and it lost the tense anxious almost agonised look
it assumed the moment she turned her back on her husband and
stepdaughter

Why Joe she whispered for she had left the door open behind
her and Daisy had already begun to read aloud as her father had
bidden her Come in do Its fairly cold tonight

A glance at his face had shown her that there was no fresh news

Joe Chandler walked in past her into the little hall Cold
Well he didnt feel cold for he had walked quickly to be the
sooner where he was now

Nine days had gone by since that last terrible occurrence the
double murder which had been committed early in the morning of
the day Daisy had arrived in London And though the thousands of
men belonging to the Metropolitan Policeto say nothing of the
smaller more alert body of detectives attached to the Force
were keenly on the alert not one but had begun to feel that
there was nothing to be alert about Familiarity even with
horror breeds contempt

But with the public it was far otherwise Each day something
happened to revive and keep alive the mingled horror and interest
this strange enigmatic series of crimes had evoked Even the
more sober organs of the Press went on attacking with gathering
severity and indignation the Commissioner of Police and at the
huge demonstration held in Victoria Park two days before violent
speeches had also been made against the Home Secretary

But just now Joe Chandler wanted to forget all that The little
house in the Marylebone Road had become to him an enchanted isle
of dreams to which his thoughts were ever turning when he had a
moment to spare from what had grown to be a wearisome because an
unsatisfactory job He secretly agreed with one of his pals who
had exclaimed and that within twentyfour hours of the last double
crime Why twould be easier to find a needle in a rick o hay
than thisbloke

And if that had been true then how much truer it was nowafter
nine long empty days had gone by

Quickly he divested himself of his greatcoat muffler and low hat
Then he put his finger on his lip and motioned smilingly to Mrs
Bunting to wait a moment From where he stood in the hall the
father and daughter made a pleasant little picture of contented
domesticity Joe Chandlers honest heart swelled at the sight

Daisy wearing the blueandwhite check silk dress about which her
stepmother and she had had words sat on a low stool on the left
side of the fire while Bunting leaning back in his own comfortable
armchair was listening his hand to his ear in an attitudeas
it was the first time she had caught him doing it the fact brought
a pang to Mrs Buntingwhich showed that age was beginning to
creep over the listener

One of Daisys duties as companion to her greataunt was that of
reading the newspaper aloud and she prided herself on her
accomplishment

Just as Joe had put his finger on his lip Daisy had been asking
Shall I read this father And Bunting had answered quickly
Aye do my dear

He was absorbed in what he was hearing and on seeing Joe at the
door he had only just nodded his head The young man was becoming
so frequent a visitor as to be almost one of themselves

Daisy read out

The Avenger A

And then she stopped short for the next word puzzled her greatly
Bravely however she went on A theory

Go indo whispered Mrs Bunting to her visitor Why should
we stay out here in the cold Its ridiculous

I dont want to interrupt Miss Daisy whispered Chandler back
rather hoarsely

Well youll hear it all the better in the room Dont think
shell stop because of you bless you Theres nothing shy about
our Daisy

The young man resented the tart short tone Poor little girl
he said to himself tenderly Thats what it is having a stepmother
instead of a proper mother But he obeyed Mrs Bunting and then
he was pleased he had done so for Daisy looked up and a bright
blush came over her pretty face

Joe begs you wont stop yet awhile Go on with your reading
commanded Mrs Bunting quickly Now Joe you can go and sit over
there close to Daisy and then you wont miss a word

There was a sarcastic inflection in her voice even Chandler noticed
that but he obeyed her with alacrity and crossing the room he went
and sat on a chair just behind Daisy From there he could note with
reverent delight the charming way her fair hair grew upwards from
the nape of her slender neck

The AVENGER A THEORY

began Daisy again clearing her throat

DEAR SirI have a suggestion to put forward for which I think
there is a great deal to be said It seems to me very probable
that The Avengerto give him the name by which he apparently
wishes to be knowncomprises in his own person the peculiarities
of Jekyll and Hyde Mr Louis Stevensons now famous hero

The culprit according to my point of view is a quiet
pleasantlooking gentleman who lives somewhere in the West End of
London He has however a tragedy in his past life He is the
husband of a dipsomaniac wife She is of course under care and
is never mentioned in the house where he lives maybe with his
widowed mother and perhaps a maiden sister They notice that he
has become gloomy and brooding of late but he lives his usual life
occupying himself each day with some harmless hobby On foggy
nights once the quiet household is plunged in sleep he creeps out
of the house maybe between one and two oclock and swiftly makes
his way straight to what has become The Avengers murder area
Picking out a likely victim he approaches her with Judaslike
gentleness and having committed his awful crime goes quietly home
again After a good bath and breakfast he turns up happy once
more the quiet individual who is an excellent son a kind brother
esteemed and even beloved by a large circle of friends and
acquaintances Meantime the police are searching about the scene
of the tragedy for what they regard as the usual type of criminal
lunatic

I give this theory Sir for what it is worth but I confess that
I am amazed the police have so wholly confined their inquiries to
the part of London where these murders have been actually committed
I am quite sure from all that has come outand we must remember
that full information is never given to the newspapersThe Avenger
should be sought for in the West and not in the East End of London
Believe me to remain Sir yours very truly

Again Daisy hesitated and then with an effort she brought out the
word Gaboriyou said she

What a funny name said Bunting wonderingly

And then Joe broke in Thats the name of a French chap what wrote
detective stories he said Pretty good some of them are too

Then this Gaboriyou has come over to study these Avenger murders
I take it said Bunting

Oh no Joe spoke with confidence Whoevers written that silly
letter just signed that name for fun

It is a silly letter Mrs Bunting had broken in resentfully I
wonder a respectable paper prints such rubbish

Fancy if The Avenger did turn out to be a gentleman cried Daisy in
an awestruck voice Thered be a howtodo

There may be something in the notion said her father thoughtfully
After all the monster must be somewhere This very minute he must
be somewhere ahiding of himself

Of course hes somewhere said Mrs Bunting scornfully

She had just heard Mr Sleuth moving overhead Twould soon be time
for the lodgers supper

She hurried on But what I do say is thatthathe has nothing
to do with the West End Why they say its a sailor from the Docks
thats a good bit more likely I take it But there Im fair
sick of the whole subject We talk of nothing else in this house
The Avenger thisThe Avenger that

I expect Joe has something to tell us new tonight said Bunting
cheerfully Well Joe is there anything new

I say father just listen to this Daisy broke in excitedly
She read out


BLOODHOUNDS TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED


Bloodhounds repeated Mrs Bunting and there was terror in her
tone Why bloodhounds That do seem to me a most horrible idea

Bunting looked across at her mildly astonished Why twould be
a very good idea if twas possible to have bloodhounds in a town
But there how can that be done in London full of butchers shops
to say nothing of slaughteryards and other places o that sort

But Daisy went on and to her stepmothers shrinking ear there
seemed a horrible thrill of delight of gloating pleasure in her
fresh young voice

Hark to this she said

A man who had committed a murder in a lonely wood near Blackburn
was traced by the help of a bloodhound and thanks to the sagacious
instincts of the animal the miscreant was finally convicted and
hanged

La now Whod ever have thought of such a thing Bunting
exclaimed in admiration The newspapers do have some useful
hints in sometimes Joe

But young Chandler shook his head Bloodhounds aint no use he
said no use at all If the Yard was to listen to all the
suggestions that the last few days have brought inwell all I
can say is our work would be cut out for usnot but what its
cut out for us now if it comes to that He sighed ruefully He
was beginning to feel very tired if only he could stay in this
pleasant cosy room listening to Daisy Bunting reading on and on
for ever instead of having to go out as he would presently have
to do into the cold and foggy night

Joe Chandler was fast becoming very sick of his new job There
was a lot of unpleasantness attached to the business too Why
even in the house where he lived and in the little cookshop where
he habitually took his meals the people round him had taken to
taunt him with the remissness of the police More than that one of
his pals a man hed always looked up to because the young fellow
had the gift of the gab had actually been among those who had
spoken at the big demonstration in Victoria Park making a violent
speech not only against the Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police but also against the Home Secretary

But Daisy like most people who believe themselves blessed with the
possession of an accomplishment had no mind to leave off reading
just yet

Heres another notion she exclaimed Another letter father


PARDON TO ACCOMPLICES


DEAR SirDuring the last day or two several of the more
Intelligent of my acquaintances have suggested that The Avenger
whoever he may be must be known to a certain number of persons
It is impossible that the perpetrator of such deeds however
nomad he may be in his habits

Now I wonder what nomad can be Daisy interrupted herself and
looked round at her little audience

Ive always declared the fellow had all his senses about him
observed Bunting confidently

Daisy went on quite satisfied

however nomad he may be in his habit must have some habitat
where his ways are known to at least one person Now the person
who knows the terrible secret is evidently withholding information
in expectation of a reward or maybe because being an accessory
after the fact he or she is now afraid of the consequences My
suggestion Sir is that the Home Secretary promise a free pardon
The more so that only thus can this miscreant be brought to justice
Unless he was caught redhanded in the act it will be exceedingly
difficult to trace the crime committed to any individual for
English law looks very askance at circumstantial evidence

Theres something worth listening to in that letter said Joe
leaning forward

Now he was almost touching Daisy and he smiled involuntarily as
she turned her gay pretty little face the better to hear what he
was saying

Yes Mr Chandler she said interrogatively

Well dyou remember that fellow what killed an old gentleman in
a railway carriage He took refuge with someonea woman his
mother had known and she kept him hidden for quite a long time
But at last she gave him up and she got a big reward too

I dont think Id like to give anybody up for a reward said
Bunting in his slow dogmatic way

Oh yes you would Mr Bunting said Chandler confidently Youd
only be doing what its the plain duty of everyoneeveryone that
is whos a good citizen And youd be getting something for doing
it which is more than most people gets as does their duty

A man as gives up someone for a reward is no better than a common
informer went on Bunting obstinately And no man ud care to be
called that Its different for you Joe he added hastily Its
your job to catch those whove done anything wrong And a mand be
a fool whod take refugelike with you Hed be walking into the
lions mouth Bunting laughed

And then Daisy broke in coquettishly If Id done anything I
wouldnt mind going for help to Mr Chandler she said

And Joe with eyes kindling cried No And if you did you neednt
be afraid Id give you up Miss Daisy

And then to their amazement there suddenly broke from Mrs Bunting
sitting with bowed head over the table an exclamation of impatience
and anger and it seemed to those listening of pain

Why Ellen dont you feel well asked Bunting quickly

Just a spasm a sharp stitch in my side like answered the poor
woman heavily Its over now Dont mind me

But I dont believeno that I dontthat theres anybody in
the world who knows who The Avenger is went on Chandler quickly
It stands to reason that anybodyd give him upin their own
interest if not in anyone elses Whod shelter such a creature
Why twould be dangerous to have him in the house along with one

Then its your idea that hes not responsible for the wicked things
he does Mrs Bunting raised her head and looked over at Chandler
with eager anxious eyes

Id be sorry to think he wasnt responsible enough to hang said
Chandler deliberately After all the trouble hes been giving us too

Hangingd be too good for that chap said Bunting

Not if hes not responsible said his wife sharply I never
heard of anything so cruelthat I never did If the mans a
madman he ought to be in an asylumthats where he ought to be

Hark to her now Bunting looked at his Ellen with amusement
Contrary isnt the word for her But there Ive noticed the last
few days that she seemed to be taking that monsters part Thats
what comes of being a born total abstainer

Mrs Bunting had got up from her chair What nonsense you do talk
she said angrily Not but what its a good thing if these murders
have emptied the publichouses of women for a bit Englands drink
is Englands shameIll never depart from that Now Daisy child
get up do Put down that paper Weve heard quite enough You can
be laying the cloth while I goes down the kitchen

Yes you mustnt be forgetting the lodgers supper called out
Bunting Mr Sleuth dont always ring he turned to Chandler
For one thing hes often out about this time

Not oftenjust now and again when he wants to buy something
snapped out Mrs Bunting But I hadnt forgot his supper He
never do want it before eight oclock

Let me take up the lodgers supper Ellen Daisys eager voice
broke in She had got up in obedience to her stepmother and was
now laying the cloth

Certainly not I told you he only wanted me to wait on him You
have your work cut out looking after things down herethats where
I wants you to help me

Chandler also got up Somehow he didnt like to be doing nothing
while Daisy was so busy Yes he said looking across at Mrs
Bunting Id forgotten about your lodger Going on all right eh

Never knew so quiet and wellbehaved a gentleman said Bunting
He turned our luck did Mr Sleuth

His wife left the room and after she had gone Daisy laughed
Youll hardly believe it Mr Chandler but Ive never seen this
wonderful lodger Ellen keeps him to herself that she does If I
was father Id be jealous

Both men laughed Ellen No the idea was too funny



CHAPTER XII

All I can say is I think Daisy ought to go One cant always do
just what one wants to donot in this world at any rate

Mrs Bunting did not seem to be addressing anyone in particular
though both her husband and her stepdaughter were in the room She
was standing by the table staring straight before her and as she
spoke she avoided looking at either Bunting or Daisy There was in
her voice a tone of cross decision of thin finality with which
they were both acquainted and to which each listener knew the other
would have to bow

There was silence for a moment then Daisy broke out passionately
I dont see why I should go if I dont want to she cried
Youll allow Ive been useful to you Ellen Tisnt even as if
you was quite well

I am quite wellperfectly well snapped out Mrs Bunting and
she turned her pale drawn face and looked angrily at her
stepdaughter

Taint often I has a chance of being with you and father There
were tears in Daisys voice and Bunting glanced deprecatingly at
his wife

An invitation had come to Daisyan invitation from her own dead
mothers sister who was housekeeper in a big house in Belgrave
Square The family had gone away for the Christmas holidays and
Aunt MargaretDaisy was her godchildhad begged that her niece
might come and spend two or three days with her

But the girl had already had more than one taste of what life was
like in the great gloomy basement of 100 Belgrave Square Aunt
Margaret was one of those oldfashioned servants for whom the modern
employer is always sighing While the family were away it was
her joyshe regarded it as a privilegeto wash sixtyseven pieces
of very valuable china contained in two cabinets in the drawingroom
she also slept in every bed by turns to keep them all well aired
These were the two duties with which she intended her young niece
to assist her and Daisys soul sickened at the prospect

But the matter had to be settled at once The letter had come an
hour ago containing a stamped telegraph form and Aunt Margaret
was not one to be trifled with

Since breakfast the three had talked of nothing else and from the
very first Mrs Bunting had said that Daisy ought to gothat there
was no doubt about it that it did not admit of discussion But
discuss it they all did and for once Bunting stood up to his wife
But that as was natural only made his Ellen harder and more set
on her own view

What the child says is true he observed It isnt as if you
was quite well Youve been took bad twice in the last few days
you cant deny of it Ellen Why shouldnt I just take a bus
and go over and see Margaret Id tell her just how it is Shed
understand bless you

I wont have you doing nothing of the sort cried Mrs Bunting
speaking almost as passionately as her stepdaughter had done
Havent I a right to be ill havent I a right to be took bad
aye and to feel all right againsame as other people

Daisy turned round and clasped her hands Oh Ellen she cried
do say that you cant spare me I dont want to go across to that
horrid old dungeon of a place

Do as you like said Mrs Bunting sullenly Im fair tired of
you both Therell come a day Daisy when youll know like me
that money is the main thing that matters in this world and when
your Aunt Margarets left her savings to somebody else just because
you wouldnt spend a few days with her this Christmas then youll
know what its like to go withoutyoull know what a fool you
were and that nothing cant alter it any more

And then with victory actually in her grasp poor Daisy saw it
snatched from her

Ellen is right Bunting said heavily Money does mattera
terrible dealthough I never thought to hear Ellen say twas the
only thing that mattered But twould be foolishvery very
foolish my girl to offend your Aunt Margaret Itll only be
two days after alltwo days isnt a very long time

But Daisy did not hear her fathers last words She had already
rushed from the room and gone down to the kitchen to hide her
childish tears of disappointmentthe childish tears which came
because she was beginning to be a woman with a womans natural
instinct for building her own human nest

Aunt Margaret was not one to tolerate the comings of any strange
young man and she had a peculiar dislike to the police

Whod ever have thought shed have minded as much as that
Bunting looked across at Ellen deprecatingly already his heart
was misgiving him

Its plain enough why shes become so fond of us all of a sudden
said Mrs Bunting sarcastically And as her husband stared at her
uncomprehendingly she added in a tantalising tone as plain as
the nose on your face my man

What dyou mean he said I daresay Im a bit slow Ellen but
I really dont know what youd be at

Dont you remember telling me before Daisy came here that Joe
Chandler had become sweet on her last summer I thought it only
foolishness then but Ive come round to your viewthats all

Bunting nodded his head slowly Yes Joe had got into the way of
coming very often and there had been the expedition to that gruesome
Scotland Yard museum but somehow he Bunting had been so interested
in the Avenger murders that he hadnt thought of Joe in any other
connectionnot this time at any rate

And do you think Daisy likes him There was an unwonted tone of
excitement of tenderness in Buntings voice

His wife looked over at him and a thin smile not an unkindly
smile by any means lit up her pale face Ive never been one
to prophesy she answered deliberately But this I dont mind
telling you BuntingDaisyll have plenty o time to get tired
of Joe Chandler before they two are dead Mark my words

Well she might do worse said Bunting ruminatingly Hes as
steady as God makes them and hes already earning thirtytwo
shillings a week But I wonder how Old Auntd like the notion
I dont see her parting with Daisy before she must

I wouldnt let no old aunt interfere with me about such a thing
as that cried Mrs Bunting No not for millions of gold
And Bunting looked at her in silent wonder Ellen was singing a
very different tune now to what shed sung a few minutes ago when
she was so keen about the girl going to Belgrave Square

If she still seems upset while shes having her dinner said his
wife suddenly well you just wait till Ive gone out for something
and then you just say to her Absence makes the heart grow fonder
just that and nothing more Shell take it from you And I
shouldnt be surprised if it comforted her quite a lot

For the matter of that theres no reason why Joe Chandler shouldnt
go over and see her there said Bunting hesitatingly

Oh yes there is said Mrs Bunting smiling shrewdly Plenty of
reason Daisyll be a very foolish girl if she allows her aunt to
know any of her secrets Ive only seen that woman once but I know
exactly the sort Margaret is Shes just waiting for Old Aunt to
drop off and then shell want to have Daisy herselfto wait on
her like Shed turn quite nasty if she thought there was a young
fellow what stood in her way

She glanced at the dock the pretty little eightday clock which
had been a wedding present from a kind friend of her last mistress
It had mysteriously disappeared during their time of trouble and
had as mysteriously reappeared three or four days after Mr Sleuths
arrival

Ive time to go out with that telegram she said brisklysomehow
she felt better different to what she had done the last few days
and then itll be done Its no good having more words about it
and I expect we should have plenty more words if I wait till the
child comes upstairs again

She did not speak unkindly and Bunting looked at her rather
wonderingly Ellen very seldom spoke of Daisy as the child
in fact he could only remember her having done so once before
and that was a long time ago They had been talking over their
future life together and she had said very solemnly Bunting
I promise I will do my dutyas much as lies in my power that
isby the child

But Ellen had not had much opportunity of doing her duty by Daisy
As not infrequently happens with the duties that we are willing to
do that particular duty had been taken over by someone else who
had no mind to let it go

What shall I do if Mr Sleuth rings asked Bunting rather
nervously It was the first time since the lodger had come to them
that Ellen had offered to go out in the morning

She hesitated In her anxiety to have the matter of Daisy settled
she had forgotten Mr Sleuth Strange that she should have done so
strange and to herself very comfortable and pleasant

Oh well you can just go up and knock at the door and say Ill be
back in a few minutesthat I had to go out with a message Hes
quite a reasonable gentleman She went into the back room to put
on her bonnet and thick jacket for it was very coldgetting colder
every minute

As she stood buttoning her glovesshe wouldnt have gone out
untidy for the worldBunting suddenly came across to her Give
us a kiss old girl he said And his wife turned up her face

One ud think it was catching she said but there was a lilt in
her voice

So it is Bunting briefly answered Didnt that old cook get
married just after us Shed never a thought of it if it hadnt
been for you

But once she was out walking along the damp uneven pavement Mr
Sleuth revenged himself for his landladys temporary forgetfulness

During the last two days the lodger had been queer odder than usual
unlike himself or rather very much as he had been some ten days
ago just before that double murder had taken place

The night before while Daisy was telling all about the dreadful
place to which Joe Chandler had taken her and her father Mrs
Bunting had heard Mr Sleuth moving about overhead restlessly
walking up and down his sittingroom And later when she took up
his supper she had listened a moment outside the door while he
read aloud some of the texts his soul delighted interrible texts
telling of the grim joys attendant on revenge

Mrs Bunting was so absorbed in her thoughts so possessed with the
curious personality of her lodger that she did not look where she
was going and suddenly a young woman bumped up against her

She started violently and looked round dazed as the young person
muttered a word of apologythen she again fell into deep thought

It was a good thing Daisy was going away for a few days it made the
problem of Mr Sleuth and his queer ways less disturbing She
Ellen was sorry she had spoken so sharplike to the girl but after
all it wasnt wonderful that she had been snappy This last night
she had hardly slept at all Instead she had lain awake listening
and there is nothing so tiring as to lie awake listening for a
sound that never comes

The house had remained so still you could have heard a pin drop Mr
Sleuth lying snug in his nice warm bed upstairs had not stirred
Had he stirred his landlady was bound to have heard him for his bed
was as we know just above hers No during those long hours of
darkness Daisys light regular breathing was all that had fallen on
Mrs Buntings ears

And then her mind switched off Mr Sleuth She made a determined
effort to expel him to toss him as it were out of her thoughts

It seemed strange that The Avenger had stayed his hand for as Joe
had said only last evening it was full time that he should again
turn that awful mysterious searchlight of his on himself Mrs
Bunting always visioned The Avenger as a black shadow in the centre
a bright blinding lightbut the shadow had no form or definite
substance Sometimes he looked like one thing sometimes like
another   

Mrs Bunting had now come to the corner which led up the street
where there was a Post Office But instead of turning sharp to the
left she stopped short for a minute

There had suddenly come over her a feeling of horrible selfrebuke
and even selfloathing It was dreadful that she of all women
should have longed to hear that another murder had been committed
last night

Yet such was the shameful fact She had listened all through
breakfast hoping to hear the dread news being shouted outside yes
and more or less during the long discussion which had followed on
the receipt of Margarets letter she had been hopinghoping
against hopethat those dreadful triumphant shouts of the
newspapersellers still might come echoing down the Marylebone Road
And yet hypocrite that she was she had reproved Bunting when he
had expressed not disappointment exactlybut well surprise
that nothing had happened last night

Now her mind switched off to Joe Chandler Strange to think how
afraid she had been of that young man She was no longer afraid of
him or hardly at all He was dottythats what was the matter
with him dotty with love for rosycheeked blueeyed little Daisy
Anything might now go on right under Joe Chandlers very nosebut
bless you hed never see it Last summer when this affair this
nonsense of young Chandler and Daisy had begun she had had very
little patience with it all In fact the memory of the way Joe
had gone on then the tiresome way he would be always dropping in
had been one reason though not the most important reason of all
why she had felt so terribly put about at the idea of the girl
coming again But now Well now she had become quite tolerant
quite kindlyat any rate as far as Joe Chandler was concerned

She wondered why

Still twouldnt do Joe a bit of harm not to see the girl for a
couple of days In fact twould be a very good thing for then hed
think of Daisythink of her to the exclusion of all else Absence
does make the heart grow fonderat first at any rate Mrs
Bunting was well aware of that During the long course of hers
and Buntings mild courting theyd been separated for about three
months and it was that three months which had made up her mind for
her She had got so used to Bunting that she couldnt do without
him and she had feltoddest fact of allacutely miserably
jealous But she hadnt let him know thatno fear

Of course Joe mustnt neglect his jobthat would never do But
what a good thing it was after all that he wasnt like some of
those detective chaps that are written about in storiesthe sort
of chaps that know everything see everything guess everything
even where there isnt anything to see or know or guess

Why to take only one little factJoe Chandler had never shown
the slightest curiosity about their lodger   

Mrs Bunting pulled herself together with a start and hurried
quickly on Bunting would begin to wonder what had happened to her

She went into the Post Office and handed the form to the young woman
without a word Margaret a sensible woman who was accustomed to
manage other peoples affairs had even written out the words Will
be with you to teaDAISY

It was a comfort to have the thing settled once for all If anything
horrible was going to happen in the next two or three daysit was
just as well Daisy shouldnt be at home Not that there was any real
danger that anything would happenMrs Bunting felt sure of that

By this time she was out in the street again and she began mentally
counting up the number of murders The Avenger had committed Nine
or was it ten Surely by now The Avenger must be avenged Surely by
now ifas that writer in the newspaper had suggestedhe was a
quiet blameless gentleman living in the West End whatever vengeance
he had to wreak must be satisfied

She began hurrying homewards it wouldnt do for the lodger to ring
before she had got back Bunting would never know how to manage Mr
Sleuth especially if Mr Sleuth was in one of his queer moods



Mrs Bunting put the key into the front door lock and passed into
the house Then her heart stood still with fear and terror There
came the sound of voicesof voices she thought she did not know
in the sittingroom

She opened the door and then drew a long breath It was only Joe
ChandlerJoe Daisy and Bunting talking together They stopped
rather guiltily as she came in but not before she had heard
Chandler utter the words That dont mean nothing Ill just run
out and send another saying you wont come Miss Daisy

And then the strangest smile came over Mrs Buntings face There
had fallen on her ear the still distant but unmistakable shouts
which betokened that something had happened last nightsomething
which made it worth while for the newspapersellers to come crying
down the Marylebone Road

Well she said a little breathlessly Well Joe I suppose
youve brought us news I suppose theres been another

He looked at her surprised No that there hasnt Mrs Bunting
not as far as I know that is Oh youre thinking of those
newspaper chaps Theyve got to cry out something he grinned
You wouldnt a thought folk was so bloodthirsty Theyre just
shouting out that theres been an arrest but we dont take no
stock of that Its a Scotchman what gave himself up last night
at Dorking Hed been drinking and was apitying of himself
Why since this business began theres been about twenty arrests
but theyve all come to nothing

Why Ellen you looks quite sad quite disappointed said Bunting
jokingly Come to think of it its high time The Avenger was at
work again He laughed as he made his grim joke Then turned to
young Chandler Well youll be glad when its all over my lad

Glad in a way said Chandler unwillingly But one ud have liked
to have caught him One doesnt like to know such a creatures at
large now does one

Mrs Bunting had taken off her bonnet and jacket I must just go
and see about Mr Sleuths breakfast she said in a weary
dispirited voice and left them there

She felt disappointed and very very depressed As to the plot
which had been hatching when she came in that had no chance of
success Bunting would never dare let Daisy send out another
telegram contradicting the first Besides Daisys stepmother
shrewdly suspected that by now the girl herself wouldnt care to
do such a thing Daisy had plenty of sense tucked away somewhere
in her pretty little head If it ever became her fate to live as
a married woman in London it would be best to stay on the right
side of Aunt Margaret

And when she came into her kitchen the stepmothers heart became
very soft for Daisy had got everything beautifully ready In fact
there was nothing to do but to boil Mr Sleuths two eggs Feeling
suddenly more cheerful than she had felt of late Mrs Bunting took
the tray upstairs

As it was rather late I didnt wait for you to ring sir she
said

And the lodger looked up from the table where as usual he was
studying with painful almost agonising intentness the Book
Quite right Mrs Buntingquite right I have been pondering
over the command Work while it is yet light

Yes sir she said and a queer cold feeling stole over her
heart Yes sir

The spirit is willing but the fleshthe flesh is weak said
Mr Sleuth with a heavy sigh

You studies too hard and too longthats whats ailing you sir
said Mr Sleuths landlady suddenly



When Mrs Bunting went down again she found that a great deal had
been settled in her absence among other things that Joe Chandler
was going to escort Miss Daisy across to Belgrave Square He
could carry Daisys modest bag and if they wanted to ride instead
of walk why they could take the bus from Baker Street Station
to Victoriathat would land them very near Belgrave Square

But Daisy seemed quite willing to walk she hadnt had a walk she
declared for a long long timeand then she blushed rosy red
and even her stepmother had to admit to herself that Daisy was very
nice looking not at all the sort of girl who ought to be allowed to
go about the London streets by herself



CHAPTER XIII

Daisys father and stepmother stood side by side at the front door
watching the girl and young Chandler walk off into the darkness

A yellow pall of fog had suddenly descended on London and Joe had
come a full halfhour before they expected him explaining rather
lamely that it was the fog which had brought him so soon

If we was to have waited much longer perhaps twouldnt have been
possible to walk a yard he explained and they had accepted
silently his explanation

I hope its quite safe sending her off like that Bunting looked
deprecatingly at his wife She had already told him more than once
that he was too fussy about Daisy that about his daughter he was
like an old hen with her last chicken

Shes safer than she would be with you or me She couldnt have
a smarter young fellow to look after her

Itll be awful thick at Hyde Park Corner said Bunting Its
always worse there than anywhere else If I was Joe Id a taken
her by the Underground Railway to Victoriathat ud been the best
way considering the weather tis

They dont think anything of the weather bless you said his
wife Theyll walk and walk as long as theres a glimmer left for
em to steer by Daisys just been pining to have a walk with that
young chap I wonder you didnt notice how disappointed they both
were when you was so set on going along with them to that horrid
place

Dyou really mean that Ellen Bunting looked upset I understood
Joe to say he liked my company

Oh did you said Mrs Bunting dryly I expect he liked it just
about as much as we liked the company of that old cook who would go
out with us when we was courting It always was a wonder to me how
the woman could force herself upon two people who didnt want her

But Im Daisys father and an old friend of Chandler said Bunting
remonstratingly Im quite different from that cook She was
nothing to us and we was nothing to her

Shed have liked to be something to you I make no doubt observed
his Ellen shaking her head and her husband smiled a little
foolishly

By this time they were back in their nice cosy sittingroom and
a feeling of not altogether unpleasant lassitude stole over Mrs
Bunting It was a comfort to have Daisy out of her way for a bit
The girl in some ways was very wide awake and inquisitive and
she had early betrayed what her stepmother thought to be a very
unseemly and silly curiosity concerning the lodger You might
just let me have one peep at him Ellen she had pleaded only
that morning But Ellen had shaken her head No that I wont
Hes a very quiet gentleman but he knows exactly what he likes
and he dont like anyone but me waiting on him Why even your
fathers hardly seen him

But that naturally had only increased Daisys desire to view Mr
Sleuth

There was another reason why Mrs Bunting was glad that her
stepdaughter had gone away for two days During her absence young
Chandler was far less likely to haunt them in the way he had taken
to doing lately the more so that in spite of what she had said to
her husband Mrs Bunting felt sure that Daisy would ask Joe
Chandler to call at Belgrave Square Twouldnt be human nature
at any rate not girlish human naturenot to do so even if
Joes coming did anger Aunt Margaret

Yes it was pretty safe that with Daisy away they the Buntings
would be rid of that young chap for a bit and that would be a
good thing

When Daisy wasnt there to occupy the whole of his attention Mrs
Bunting felt queerly afraid of Chandler After all he was a
detectiveit was his job to be always nosing about trying to
find out things And though she couldnt fairly say to herself
that he had done much of that sort of thing in her house he might
start doing it any minute And thenthenwhere would she and
and Mr Sleuth be

She thought of the bottle of red inkof the leather bag which
must be hidden somewhereand her heart almost stopped beating
Those were the sort of things which in the stories Bunting was
so fond of reading always led to the detection of famous
criminals   

Mr Sleuths bell for tea rang that afternoon far earlier than
usual The fog had probably misled him and made him think it
later than it was

When she went up I would like a cup of tea now and just one
piece of breadandbutter the lodger said wearily I dont
feel like having anything else this afternoon

Its a horrible day Mrs Bunting observed in a cheerier voice
than usual No wonder you dont feel hungry sir And then it
isnt so very long since you had your dinner is it

No he said absently No it isnt Mrs Bunting

She went down made the tea and brought it up again And then
as she came into the room she uttered an exclamation of sharp
dismay

Mr Sleuth was dressed for going out He was wearing his long
Inverness cloak and his queer old high hat lay on the table
ready for him to put on

Youre never going out this afternoon sir she asked falteringly
Why the fogs awful you cant see a yard ahead of you

Unknown to herself Mrs Buntings voice had risen almost to a
scream She moved back still holding the tray and stood between
the door and her lodger as if she meant to bar his wayto erect
between Mr Sleuth and the dark foggy world outside a living
barrier

The weather never affects me at all he said sullenly and he
looked at her with so wild and pleading a look in his eyes that
slowly reluctantly she moved aside As she did so she noticed
for the first time that Mr Sleuth held something in his right
hand It was the key of the chiffonnier cupboard He had been
on his way there when her coming in had disturbed him

Its very kind of you to be so concerned about me he stammered
butbut Mrs Bunting you must excuse me if I say that I do
not welcome such solicitude I prefer to be left alone II
cannot stay in your house if I feel that my comings and goings are
watchedspied upon

She pulled herself together No one spies upon you sir she
said with considerable dignity Ive done my best to satisfy
you

You haveyou have he spoke in a distressed apologetic tone
But you spoke just now as if you were trying to prevent my doing
what I wish to doindeed what I have to do For years I have
been misunderstoodpersecutedhe waited a moment then in
a hollow voice added the one word tortured Do not tell me that
you are going to add yourself to the number of my tormentors Mrs
Bunting

She stared at him helplessly Dont you be afraid Ill ever be
that sir I only spoke as I did becausewell sir because I
thought it really wasnt safe for a gentleman to go out this
afternoon Why theres hardly anyone about though were so near
Christmas

He walked across to the window and looked out The fog is clearing
somewhat Mrs Bunting but there was no relief in his voice rather
was there disappointment and dread

Plucking up courage she followed him Yes Mr Sleuth was right
The fog was liftingrolling off in that sudden mysterious way in
which local fogs sometimes do lift in London

He turned sharply from the window Our conversation has made me
forget an important thing Mrs Bunting I should be glad if you
would just leave out a glass of milk and some breadandbutter for
me this evening I shall not require supper when I come in for
after my walk I shall probably go straight upstairs to carry through
a very difficult experiment

Very good sir And then Mrs Bunting left the lodger

But when she found herself downstairs in the fogladen hall for it
had drifted in as she and her husband had stood at the door seeing
Daisy off instead of going in to Bunting she did a very odd thing
a thing she had never thought of doing in her life before She
pressed her hot forehead against the cool bit of lookingglass let
into the hatandumbrella stand I dont know what to do she
moaned to herself and then I cant bear it I cant bear it

But though she felt that her secret suspense and trouble was becoming
intolerable the one way in which she could have ended her misery
never occurred to Mrs Bunting

In the long history of crime it has very very seldom happened that
a woman has betrayed one who has taken refuge with her The
timorous and cautious woman has not infrequently hunted a human
being fleeing from his pursuer from her door but she has not
revealed the fact that he was ever there In fact it may almost
be said that such betrayal has never taken place unless the betrayer
has been actuated by love of gain or by a longing for revenge So
far perhaps because she is subject rather than citizen her duty
as a component part of civilised society weighs but lightly on
womans shoulders

And thenand then in a sort of way Mrs Bunting had become
attached to Mr Sleuth A wan smile would sometimes light up his
sad face when he saw her come in with one of his meals and when
this happened Mrs Bunting felt pleasedpleased and vaguely
touched In between thosethose dreadful events outside which
filled her with such suspicion such anguish and such suspense
she never felt any fear only pity for Mr Sleuth

Often and often when lying wide awake at night she turned over
the strange problem in her mind After all the lodger must have
lived somewhere during his fortyodd years of life She did not
even know if Mr Sleuth had any brothers or sisters friends she
knew he had none But however odd and eccentric he was he had
evidently or so she supposed led a quiet undistinguished kind
of life tilltill now

What had made him alter all of a suddenif that is he had
altered That was what Mrs Bunting was always debating fitfully
with herself and what was more and very terribly to the point
having altered why should he not in time go back to what he
evidently had beenthat is a blameless quiet gentleman

If only he would If only he would

As she stood in the hall cooling her hot forehead all these
thoughts these hopes and fears jostled at lightning speed through
her brain

She remembered what young Chandler had said the other daythat
there had never been in the history of the world so strange a
murderer as The Avenger had proved himself to be

She and Bunting aye and little Daisy too had hung fascinated
on Joes words as he had told them of other famous series of
murders which had taken place in the past not only in England but
abroadespecially abroad

One woman whom all the people round her believed to be a kind
respectable soul had poisoned no fewer than fifteen people in order
to get their insurance money Then there had been the terrible tale
of an apparently respectable contented innkeeper and his wife who
living at the entrance to a wood killed all those humble travellers
who took shelter under their roof simply for their clothes and any
valuables they possessed But in all those stories the murderer or
murderers always had a very strong motive the motive being in
almost every case a wicked lust for gold

At last after having passed her handkerchief over her forehead she
went into the room where Bunting was sitting smoking his pipe

The fogs lifting a bit she said in an illassured voice I hope
that by this time Daisy and that Joe Chandler are right out of it

But the other shook his head silently No such luck he said
briefly You dont know what its like in Hyde Park Ellen I
expect twill soon be just as heavy here as twas half an hour ago

She wandered over to the window and pulled the curtain back
Quite a lot of people have come out anyway she observed

Theres a fine Christmas show in the Edgware Road I was thinking
of asking if you wouldnt like to go along there with me

No she said dully Im quite content to stay at home

She was listeninglistening for the sounds which would betoken
that the lodger was coming downstairs

At last she heard the cautious stuffless tread of his rubbersoled
shoes shuffling along the hall But Bunting only woke to the fact
when the front door shut to

Thats never Mr Sleuth going out He turned on his wife
startled Why the poor gentlemanll come to harmthat he will
One has to be wide awake on an evening like this I hope he hasnt
taken any of his money out with him

Tisnt the first time Mr Sleuths been out in a fog said Mrs
Bunting sombrely

Somehow she couldnt help uttering these overtrue words And then
she turned eager and half frightened to see how Bunting had taken
what she said

But he looked quite placid as if he had hardly heard her We
dont get the good old fogs we used to getnot what people used
to call London particulars I expect the lodger feels like Mrs
CrowleyIve often told you about her Ellen

Mrs Bunting nodded

Mrs Crowley had been one of Buntings ladies one of those he had
liked besta cheerful jolly lady who used often to give her
servants what she called a treat It was seldom the kind of treat
they would have chosen for themselves but still they appreciated
her kind thought

Mrs Crowley used to say went on Bunting in his slow dogmatic
way that she never minded how bad the weather was in London so
long as it was London and not the country Mr Crowley he liked
the country best but Mrs Crowley always felt dulllike there
Fog never kept her from going outno that it didnt She wasnt
a bit afraid But he turned round and looked at his wife
I am a bit surprised at Mr Sleuth I should have thought him a
timid kind of gentleman

He waited a moment and she felt forced to answer him

I wouldnt exactly call him timid she said in a low voice but
he is very quiet certainly Thats why he dislikes going out when
there are a lot of people bustling about the streets I dont
suppose hell be out long

She hoped with all her soul that Mr Sleuth would be in very soon
that he would be daunted by the now increasing gloom

Somehow she did not feel she could sit still for very long She
got up and went over to the farthest window

The fog had lifted certainly She could see the lamplights on
the other side of the Marylebone Road glimmering redly and
shadowy figures were hurrying past mostly making their way towards
the Edgware Road to see the Christmas shops

At last to his wifes relief Bunting got up too He went over to
the cupboard where he kept his little store of books and took one
out

I think Ill read a bit he said Seems a long time since Ive
looked at a book The papers was so jolly interesting for a bit
but now theres nothing in em

His wife remained silent She knew what he meant A good many days
had gone by since the last two Avenger murders and the papers had
very little to say about them that they hadnt said in different
language a dozen times before

She went into her bedroom and came back with a bit of plain sewing

Mrs Bunting was fond of sewing and Bunting liked to see her so
engaged Since Mr Sleuth had come to be their lodger she had not
had much time for that sort of work

It was funny how quiet the house was without either Daisy oror
the lodger in it

At last she let her needle remain idle and the bit of cambric
slipped down on her knee while she listened longingly for Mr
Sleuths return home

And as the minutes sped by she fell to wondering with a painful
wonder if she would ever see her lodger again for from what she
knew of Mr Sleuth Mrs Bunting felt sure that if he got into any
kind ofwell trouble outside he would never betray where he
had lived during the last few weeks

No in such a case the lodger would disappear in as sudden a way
as he had come And Bunting would never suspect would never know
until perhapsGod what a horrible thoughta picture published
in some newspaper might bring a certain dreadful fact to Buntings
knowledge

But if that happenedif that unthinkably awful thing came to pass
she made up her mind here and now never to say anything She also
would pretend to be amazed shocked unutterably horrified at the
astounding revelation



CHAPTER XIV

There he is at last and Im glad of it Ellen Taint a night
you would wish a dog to be out in

Buntings voice was full of relief but he did not turn round and
look at his wife as he spoke instead he continued to read the
evening paper he held in his hand

He was still close to the fire sitting back comfortably in his
nice armchair He looked very wellwell and ruddy Mrs Bunting
stared across at him with a touch of sharp envy nay more of
resentment And this was very curious for she was in her own dry
way very fond of Bunting

You neednt feel so nervous about him Mr Sleuth can look out for
himself all right

Bunting laid the paper he had been reading down on his knee I
cant think why he wanted to go out in such weather he said
impatiently

Well its none of your business Bunting now is it

No thats true enough Still twould be a very bad thing for us
if anything happened to him This lodgers the first bit of luck
weve had for a terrible long time Ellen

Mrs Bunting moved a little impatiently in her high chair She
remained silent for a moment What Bunting had said was too obvious
to be worth answering Also she was listening following in
imagination her lodgers quick singularly quiet progress
stealthy she called it to herselfthrough the fogfilled
lamplit hall Yes now he was going up the staircase What
was that Bunting was saying

It isnt safe for decent folk to be out in such weatherno that
it aint not unless they have something to do that wont wait till
tomorrow The speaker was looking straight into his wifes narrow
colourless face Bunting was an obstinate man and liked to prove
himself right Ive a good mind to speak to him about it that
I have He ought to be told that it isnt safenot for the sort
of man he isto be wandering about the streets at night I read
you out the accidents in Lloydsshocking they were and all
brought about by the fog And then that horrid monster ull soon
be at his work again

Monster repeated Mrs Bunting absently

She was trying to hear the lodgers footsteps overhead She was
very curious to know whether he had gone into his nice sittingroom
or straight upstairs to that cold experimentroom as he now always
called it

But her husband went on as if he had not heard her and she gave up
trying to listen to what was going on above

It wouldnt be very pleasant to run up against such a party as that
in the fog eh Ellen He spoke as if the notion had a certain
pleasant thrill in it after all

What stuff you do talk said Mrs Bunting sharply And then she
got up Her husbands remarks had disturbed her Why couldnt they
talk of something pleasant when they did have a quiet bit of time
together

Bunting looked down again at his paper and she moved quietly about
the room Very soon it would be time for supper and tonight she
was going to cook her husband a nice piece of toasted cheese That
fortunate man as she was fond of telling him with mingled contempt
and envy had the digestion of an ostrich and yet he was rather
fanciful as gentlemens servants who have lived in good places
often are

Yes Bunting was very lucky in the matter of his digestion Mrs
Bunting prided herself on having a nice mind and she would never
have allowed an unrefined wordsuch a word as stomach for
instance to say nothing of an even plainer termto pass her
lips except of course to a doctor in a sickroom

Mr Sleuths landlady did not go down at once into her cold kitchen
instead with a sudden furtive movement she opened the door leading
into her bedroom and then closing the door quietly stepped back
into the darkness and stood motionless listening

At first she heard nothing but gradually there stole on her
listening ears the sound of someone moving softly about in the
room just overhead that is in Mr Sleuths bedroom But try as
she might it was impossible for her to guess what the lodger was
doing

At last she heard him open the door leading out on the little
landing She could hear the stairs creaking That meant no doubt
that Mr Sleuth would pass the rest of the evening in the cheerless
room above He hadnt spent any time up there for quite a long
whilein fact not for nearly ten days Twas odd he chose tonight
when it was so foggy to carry out an experiment

She groped her way to a chair and sat down She felt very tired
strangely tired as if she had gone through some great physical
exertion

Yes it was true that Mr Sleuth had brought her and Bunting luck
and it was wrong very wrong of her ever to forget that

As she sat there she also reminded herself and not for the first
time what the lodgers departure would mean It would almost
certainly mean ruin just as his staying meant all sorts of good
things of which physical comfort was the least If Mr Sleuth
stayed on with them as he showed every intention of doing it
meant respectability and above all security

Mrs Bunting thought of Mr Sleuths money He never received a
letter and yet he must have some kind of incomeso much was
clear She supposed he went and drew his money in sovereigns out
of a bank as he required it

Her mind swung round consciously deliberately away from Mr
Sleuth

The Avenger What a strange name Again she assured herself that
there would come a time when The Avenger whoever he was must feel
satiated when he would feel himself to be so to speak avenged

To go back to Mr Sleuth it was lucky that the lodger seemed so
pleased not only with the rooms but with his landlord and landlady
indeed there was no real reason why Mr Sleuth should ever wish
to leave such nice lodgings



Mrs Bunting suddenly stood up She made a strong effort and shook
off her awful sense of apprehension and unease Feeling for the
handle of the door giving into the passage she turned it and then
with light firm steps she went down into the kitchen

When they had first taken the house the basement had been made by
her care if not into a pleasant then at any rate into a very
clean place She had had it whitewashed and against the still
white walls the gas stove loomed up a great square of black iron
and bright steel It was a large gasstove the kind for which one
pays four shillings a quarter rent to the gas company and here in
the kitchen there was no foolish shillingintheslot arrangement
Mrs Bunting was too shrewd a woman to have anything to do with that
kind of business There was a proper gasmeter and she paid for
what she consumed after she had consumed it

Putting her candle down on the wellscrubbed wooden table she
turned up the gasjet and blew out the candle

Then lighting one of the gasrings she put a fryingpan on the
stove and once more her mind reverted as if in spite of herself
to Mr Sleuth Never had there been a more confiding or trusting
gentleman than the lodger and yet in some ways he was so secret
soso peculiar

She thought of the bagthat bag which had rumbled about so
queerly in the chiffonnier Something seemed to tell her that
tonight the lodger had taken that bag out with him

And then she thrust away the thought of the bag almost violently
from her mind and went back to the more agreeable thought of Mr
Sleuths income and of how little trouble he gave Of course
the lodger was eccentric otherwise he wouldnt be their lodger
at allhe would be living in quite a different sort of way with
some of his relations or with a friend in his own class

While these thoughts galloped disconnectedly through her mind
Mrs Bunting went on with her cooking preparing the cheese cutting
it up into little shreds carefully measuring out the butter doing
everything as was always her way with a certain delicate and
cleanly precision

And then while in the middle of toasting the bread on which was to
be poured the melted cheese she suddenly heard sounds which startled
her made her feel uncomfortable

Shuffling hesitating steps were creaking down the house

She looked up and listened

Surely the lodger was not going out again into the cold and foggy
nightgoing out as he had done the other evening for a second
time But no the sounds she heard the sounds of now familiar
footsteps did not continue down the passage leading to the front
door

InsteadWhy what was this she heard now She began to listen
so intently that the bread she was holding at the end of the
toastingfork grew quite black With a start she became aware
that this was so and she frowned vexed with herself That came
of not attending to ones work

Mr Sleuth was evidently about to do what he had never yet done
He was coming down into the kitchen

Nearer and nearer came the thudding sounds treading heavily on the
kitchen stairs and Mrs Buntings heart began to beat as if in
response She put out the flame of the gasring unheedful of the
fact that the cheese would stiffen and spoil in the cold air

Then she turned and faced the door

There came a fumbling at the handle and a moment later the door
opened and revealed as she had at once known and feared it would
do the lodger

Mr Sleuth looked even odder than usual He was clad in a plaid
dressinggown which she had never seen him wear before though
she knew that he had purchased it not long after his arrival In
his hand was a lighted candle

When he saw the kitchen all lighted up and the woman standing in
it the lodger looked inexplicably taken aback almost aghast

Yes sir What can I do for you sir I hope you didnt ring sir

Mrs Bunting held her ground in front of the stove Mr Sleuth had
no business to come like this into her kitchen and she intended to
let him know that such was her view

No II didnt ring he stammered awkwardly The truth is I
didnt know you were here Mrs Bunting Please excuse my costume
My gasstove has gone wrong or rather that shillingintheslot
arrangement has done so So I came down to see if you had a
gasstove I am going to ask you to allow me to use it tonight for
an important experiment I wish to make

Mrs Buntings heart was beating quicklyquickly She felt
horribly troubled unnaturally so Why couldnt Mr Sleuths
experiment wait till the morning She stared at him dubiously but
there was that in his face that made her at once afraid and pitiful
It was a wild eager imploring look

Oh certainly sir but you will find it very cold down here

It seems most pleasantly warm he observed his voice full of
relief warm and cosy after my cold room upstairs

Warm and cosy Mrs Bunting stared at him in amazement Nay even
that cheerless room at the top of the house must be far warmer and
more cosy than this cold underground kitchen could possibly be

Ill make you a fire sir We never use the grate but its in
perfect order for the first thing I did after I came into the house
was to have the chimney swept It was terribly dirty It might
have set the house on fire Mrs Buntings housewifely instincts
were roused For the matter of that you ought to have a fire in
your bedroom this cold night

By no meansI would prefer not I certainly do not want a fire
there I dislike an open fire Mrs Bunting I thought I had told
you as much

Mr Sleuth frowned He stood there a strangelooking figure his
candle still alight just inside the kitchen door

I shant be very long sir Just about a quarter of an hour You
could come down then Ill have everything quite tidy for you Is
there anything I can do to help you

I do not require the use of your kitchen yetthank you all the
same Mrs Bunting I shall come down lateraltogether later
after you and your husband have gone to bed But I should be much
obliged if you would see that the gas people come tomorrow and
put my stove in order It might be done while I am out That the
shillingintheslot machine should go wrong is very unpleasant
It has upset me greatly

Perhaps Bunting could put it right for you sir For the matter
of that I could ask him to go up now

No no I dont want anything of that sort done tonight Besides
he couldnt put it right I am something of an expert Mrs Bunting
and I have done all I could The cause of the trouble is quite
simple The machine is choked up with shillings a very foolish
plan so I always felt it to be

Mr Sleuth spoke pettishly with far more heat than he was wont to
speak but Mrs Bunting sympathised with him in this matter She
had always suspected that those slot machines were as dishonest as
if they were human It was dreadful the way they swallowed up
the shillings She had had one once so she knew

And as if he were divining her thoughts Mr Sleuth walked forward
and stared at the stove Then you havent got a slot machine he
said wonderingly Im very glad of that for I expect my experiment
will take some time But of course I shall pay you something for
the use of the stove Mrs Bunting

Oh no sir I wouldnt think of charging you anything for that
We dont use our stove very much you know sir Im never in the
kitchen a minute longer than I can help this cold weather

Mrs Bunting was beginning to feel better When she was actually
in Mr Sleuths presence her morbid fears would be lulled perhaps
because his manner almost invariably was gentle and very quiet
But still there came over her an eerie feeling as with him
preceding her they made a slow progress to the ground floor

Once there the lodger courteously bade his landlady goodnight
and proceeded upstairs to his own apartments

Mrs Bunting returned to the kitchen Again she lighted the stove
but she felt unnerved afraid of she knew not what As she was
cooking the cheese she tried to concentrate her mind on what she
was doing and on the whole she succeeded But another part of her
mind seemed to be working independently asking her insistent
questions

The place seemed to her alive with alien presences and once she
caught herself listeningwhich was absurd for of course she
could not hope to hear what Mr Sleuth was doing two if not three
flights upstairs She wondered in what the lodgers experiments
consisted It was odd that she had never been able to discover what
it was he really did with that big gasstove All she knew was
that he used a very high degree of heat



CHAPTER XV

The Buntings went to bed early that night But Mrs Bunting made
up her mind to keep awake She was set upon knowing at what hour
of the night the lodger would come down into her kitchen to carry
through his experiment and above all she was anxious to know
how long he would stay there

But she had had a long and a very anxious day and presently she
fell asleep

The church clock hard by struck two and suddenly Mrs Bunting
awoke She felt put out sharply annoyed with herself How could
she have dropped off like that Mr Sleuth must have been down
and up again hours ago

Then gradually she became aware that there was a faint acrid
odour in the room Elusive intangible it yet seemed to encompass
her and the snoring man by her side almost as a vapour might have
done

Mrs Bunting sat up in bed and sniffed and then in spite of the
cold she quietly crept out of her nice warm bedclothes and
crawled along to the bottom of the bed When there Mr Sleuths
landlady did a very curious thing she leaned over the brass rail
and put her face close to the hinge of the door giving into the
hall Yes it was from here that this strange horrible odor was
coming the smell must be very strong in the passage

As shivering she crept back under the bedclothes she longed to
give her sleeping husband a good shake and in fancy she heard
herself saying Bunting get up Theres something strange and
dreadful going on downstairs which we ought to know about

But as she lay there by her husbands side listening with painful
intentness for the slightest sound she knew very well that she
would do nothing of the sort

What if the lodger did make a certain amount of messa certain
amount of smellin her nice clean kitchen Was he notwas he
not an almost perfect lodger If they did anything to upset him
where could they ever hope to get another like him

Three oclock struck before Mrs Bunting heard slow heavy steps
creaking up the kitchen stairs But Mr Sleuth did not go straight
up to his own quarters as she had expected him to do Instead he
went to the front door and opening it put on the chain Then he
came past her door and she thoughtbut could not be surethat
he sat down on the stairs

At the end of ten minutes or so she heard him go down the passage
again Very softly he closed the front door By then she had
divined why the lodger had behaved in this funny fashion He wanted
to get the strong acrid smell of burningwas it of burning wool
out of the house

But Mrs Bunting lying there in the darkness listening to the
lodger creeping upstairs felt as if she herself would never get
rid of the horrible odour

Mrs Bunting felt herself to be all smell

At last the unhappy woman fell into a deep troubled sleep and
then she dreamed a most terrible and unnatural dream Hoarse
voices seemed to be shouting in her ear The Avenger close here
The Avenger close here Orrible murder off the Edgware Road
The Avenger at his work again

And even in her dream Mrs Bunting felt angeredangered and
impatient She knew so well why she was being disturbed by this
horrid nightmare It was because of BuntingBunting who could
think and talk of nothing else than those frightful murders in
which only morbid and vulgarminded people took any interest

Why even now in her dream she could hear her husband speaking
to her about it

Ellenso she heard Bunting murmur in her earEllen my dear
Im just going to get up to get a paper Its after seven oclock

The shoutingnay worse the sound of tramping hurrying feet
smote on her shrinking ears Pushing back her hair off her forehead
with both hands she sat up and listened

It had been no nightmare then but something infinitely worse
reality

Why couldnt Bunting have lain quiet abed for awhile longer and
let his poor wife go on dreaming The most awful dream would have
been easier to bear than this awakening

She heard her husband go to the front door and as he bought the
paper exchange a few excited words with the newspaperseller Then
he came back There was a pause and she heard him lighting the
gasring in the sittingroom

Bunting always made his wife a cup of tea in the morning He had
promised to do this when they first married and he had never yet
broken his word It was a very little thing and a very usual thing
no doubt for a kind husband to do but this morning the knowledge
that he was doing it brought tears to Mrs Buntings pale blue eyes
This morning he seemed to be rather longer than usual over the job

When at last he came in with the little tray Bunting found his
wife lying with her face to the wall

Heres your tea Ellen he said and there was a thrill of eager
nay happy excitement in his voice

She turned herself round and sat up Well she asked Well
Why dont you tell me about it

I thought you was asleep he stammered out I thought Ellen
you never heard nothing

How could I have slept through all that din Of course I heard
Why dont you tell me

Ive hardly had time to glance at the paper myself he said slowly

You was reading it just now she said severely for I heard the
rustling You begun reading it before you lit the gasring Dont
tell me What was that they was shouting about the Edgware Road

Well said Bunting as you do know I may as well tell you The
Avengers moving Westthats what hes doing Last time twas
Kings Crossnow tis the Edgware Road I said hed come our way
and he has come our way

You just go and get me that paper she commanded I wants to
see for myself

Bunting went into the next room then he came back and handed her
silently the oddlooking thin little sheet

Why whatevers this she asked This aint our paper

Course not he answered a trifle crossly Its a special early
edition of the Sun just because of The Avenger Heres the bit
about ithe showed her the exact spot But she would have found
it even by the comparatively bad light of the gasjet now flaring
over the dressingtable for the news was printed in large clear
characters

Once more the murder fiend who chooses to call himself The Avenger
has escaped detection While the whole attention of the police
and of the great army of amateur detectives who are taking an
interest in this strange series of atrocious crimes were
concentrating their attention round the East End and Kings Cross
he moved swiftly and silently Westward And choosing a time when
the Edgware Road is at its busiest and most thronged did another
human being to death with lightninglike quickness and savagery

Within fifty yards of the deserted warehouse yard where he had
lured his victim to destruction were passing up and down scores of
happy busy people intent on their Christmas shopping Into that
cheerful throng he must have plunged within a moment of committing
his atrocious crime And it was only owing to the merest accident
that the body was discovered as soon as it wasthat is just
after midnight

Dr Dowtray who was called to the spot at once is of opinion that
the woman had been dead at least three hours if not four It was at
first thoughtwe were going to say hopedthat this murder had
nothing to do with the series which is now puzzling and horrifying
the whole of the civilised world But nopinned on the edge of the
dead womans dress was the usual now familiar triangular piece of
grey paperthe grimmest visiting card ever designed by the wit of
man And this time The Avenger has surpassed himself as regards his
audacity and daringso cold in its maniacal fanaticism and abhorrent
wickedness

All the time that Mrs Bunting was reading with slow painful
intentness her husband was looking at her longing yet afraid to
burst out with a new idea which he was burning to confide even to his
Ellens unsympathetic ears

At last when she had quite finished she looked up defiantly

Havent you anything better to do than to stare at me like that
she said irritably Murder or no murder Ive got to get up Go
awaydo

And Bunting went off into the next room

After he had gone his wife lay back and closed her eyes She tried
to think of nothing Nay moreso strong so determined was her
will that for a few moments she actually did think of nothing She
felt terribly tired and weak brain and body both quiescent as does
a person who is recovering from a long wearing illness

Presently detached puerile thoughts drifted across the surface of
her mind like little clouds across a summer sky She wondered if
those horrid newspaper men were allowed to shout in Belgrave Square
she wondered if in that case Margaret who was so unlike her
brotherinlaw would get up and buy a paper But no Margaret
was not one to leave her nice warm bed for such a silly reason as
that

Was it tomorrow Daisy was coming back Yestomorrow not
today Well that was a comfort at any rate What amusing things
Daisy would be able to tell about her visit to Margaret The girl
had an excellent gift of mimicry And Margaret with her precise
funny ways her perpetual talk about the family lent herself to
the cruel gift

And then Mrs Buntings mindher poor weak tired mindwandered
off to young Chandler A funny thing love was when you came to
think of itwhich she Ellen Bunting didnt often do There was
Joe a likely young fellow seeing a lot of young women and pretty
young women tooquite as pretty as Daisy and ten times more
artfuland yet there He passed them all by had done so ever
since last summer though you might be sure that they artful minxes
by no manner of means passed him bywithout giving them a thought
As Daisy wasnt here he would probably keep away today There
was comfort in that thought too

And then Mrs Bunting sat up and memory returned in a dreadful
turgid flood If Joe did come in she must nerve herself to hear
all thatthat talk thered be about The Avenger between him and
Bunting

Slowly she dragged herself out of bed feeling exactly as if she
had just recovered from an illness which had left her very weak
very very tired in body and soul

She stood for a moment listeninglistening and shivering for
it was very cold Considering how early it still was there
seemed a lot of coming and going in the Marylebone Road She could
hear the unaccustomed sounds through her closed door and the tightly
fastened windows of the sittingroom There must be a regular
crowd of men and women on foot and in cabs hurrying to the scene
of The Avengers last extraordinary crime

She heard the sudden thud made by their usual morning paper falling
from the letterbox on to the floor of the hall and a moment later
came the sound of Bunting quickly quietly going out and getting it
She visualised him coming back and sitting down with a sigh of
satisfaction by the newlylit fire

Languidly she began dressing herself to the accompaniment of distant
tramping and of noise of passing traffic which increased in volume
and in sound as the moments slipped by



When Mrs Bunting went down into her kitchen everything looked just
as she had left it and there was no trace of the acrid smell she
had expected to find there Instead the cavernous whitewashed
room was full of fog but she noticed that though the shutters were
bolted and barred as she had left them the windows behind them had
been widely opened to the air She had left them shut

Making a spill out of a twist of newspapershe had been taught
the art as a girl by one of her old mistressesshe stooped and
flung open the ovendoor of her gasstove Yes it was as she had
expected a fierce heat had been generated there since she had last
used the oven and through to the stone floor below had fallen a
mass of black gluey soot

Mrs Bunting took the ham and eggs that she had bought the previous
day for her own and Buntings breakfast upstairs and broiled them
over the gasring in their sittingroom Her husband watched her in
surprised silence She had never done such a thing before

I couldnt stay down there she said it was so cold and foggy
I thought Id make breakfast up here just for today

Yes he said kindly thats quite right Ellen I think youve
done quite right my dear

But when it came to the point his wife could not eat any of the
nice breakfast she had got ready she only had another cup of tea

Im afraid youre ill Ellen Bunting asked solicitously

No she said shortly Im not ill at all Dont be silly The
thought of that horrible thing happening so close by has upset me
and put me off my food Just hark to them now

Through their closed windows penetrated the sound of scurrying feet
and loud ribald laughter What a crowd nay what a mob must be
hastening busily to and from the spot where there was now nothing
to be seen

Mrs Bunting made her husband lock the front gate I dont want
any of those ghouls in here she exclaimed angrily And then
What a lot of idle people there are in the world she said



CHAPTER XVI

Bunting began moving about the room restlessly He would go to the
window stand there awhile staring out at the people hurrying past
then coming back to the fireplace sit down

But he could not stay long quiet After a glance at his paper up
he would rise from his chair and go to the window again

I wish youd stay still his wife said at last And then a few
minutes later Hadnt you better put your hat and coat on and go
out she exclaimed

And Bunting with a rather shamed expression did put on his hat
and coat and go out

As he did so he told himself that after all he was but human it
was natural that he should be thrilled and excited by the dreadful
extraordinary thing which had just happened close by Ellen wasnt
reasonable about such things How queer and disagreeable she had
been that very morningangry with him because he had gone out
to hear what all the row was about and even more angry when he had
come back and said nothing because he thought it would annoy her
to hear about it

Meanwhile Mrs Bunting forced herself to go down again into the
kitchen and as she went through into the low whitewashed place
a tremor of fear of quick terror came over her She turned and
did what she had never in her life done before and what she had
never heard of anyone else doing in a kitchen She bolted the door

But having done this finding herself at last alone shut off from
everybody she was still beset by a strange uncanny dread She
felt as if she were locked in with an invisible presence which
mocked and jeered reproached and threatened her by turns

Why had she allowed nay encouraged Daisy to go away for two days
Daisy at any rate was companykind young unsuspecting company
With Daisy she could be her old sharp self It was such a comfort
to be with someone to whom she not only need but ought to say
nothing When with Bunting she was pursued by a sick feeling of
guilt of shame She was the mans wedded wifein his stolid way
he was very kind to her and yet she was keeping from him something
he certainly had a right to know

Not for worlds however would she have told Bunting of her dreadful
suspicionnay of her almost certainty

At last she went across to the door and unlocked it Then she went
upstairs and turned out her bedroom That made her feel a little
better

She longed for Bunting to return and yet in a way she was relieved
by his absence She would have liked to feel him near by and yet
she welcomed anything that took her husband out of the house

And as Mrs Bunting swept and dusted trying to put her whole mind
into what she was doing she was asking herself all the time what
was going on upstairs

What a good rest the lodger was having But there that was only
natural Mr Sleuth as she well knew had been up a long time last
night or rather this morning



Suddenly the drawingroom bell rang But Mr Sleuths landlady did
not go up as she generally did before getting ready the simple meal
which was the lodgers luncheon and breakfast combined Instead she
went downstairs again and hurriedly prepared the lodgers food

Then very slowly with her heart beating queerly she walked up and
just outside the sittingroomfor she felt sure that Mr Sleuth had
got up that he was there already waiting for hershe rested the
tray on the top of the banisters and listened For a few moments she
heard nothing then through the door came the high quavering voice
with which she had become so familiar

She saith to him stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in
secret is pleasant But he knoweth not that the dead are there
and that her guests are in the depths of hell

There was a long pause Mrs Bunting could hear the leaves of
her Bible being turned over eagerly busily and then again Mr
Sleuth broke out this time in a softer voice

She hath cast down many wounded from her yea many strong men
have been slain by her And in a softer lower plaintive tone
came the words I applied my heart to know and to search and
to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the
wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness

And as she stood there listening a feeling of keen distress of
spiritual oppression came over Mrs Bunting For the first time
in her life she visioned the infinite mystery the sadness and
strangeness of human life

Poor Mr Sleuthpoor unhappy distraught Mr Sleuth An
overwhelming pity blotted out for a moment the fear aye and the
loathing she had been feeling for her lodger

She knocked at the door and then she took up her tray

Come in Mrs Bunting Mr Sleuths voice sounded feebler more
toneless than usual

She turned the handle of the door and walked in The lodger was
not sitting in his usual place he had taken the little round table
on which his candle generally rested when he read in bed out of
his bedroom and placed it over by the drawingroom window On it
were placed open the Bible and the Concordance But as his
landlady came in Mr Sleuth hastily closed the Bible and began
staring dreamily out of the window down at the sordid hurrying
crowd of men and women which now swept along the Marylebone Road

There seem a great many people out today he observed without
looking round

Yes sir there do

Mrs Bunting began busying herself with laying the cloth and
putting out the breakfastlunch and as she did so she was seized
with a mortal instinctive terror of the man sitting there

At last Mr Sleuth got up and turned round She forced herself to
look at him How tired how worn he looked andhow strange

Walking towards the table on which lay his meal he rubbed his hands
together with a nervous gestureit was a gesture he only made when
something had pleased nay satisfied him Mrs Bunting looking at
him remembered that he had rubbed his hands together thus when he
had first seen the room upstairs and realised that it contained a
large gasstove and a convenient sink

What Mr Sleuth was doing now also reminded her in an odd way of a
play she had once seena play to which a young man had taken her
when she was a girl unnumbered years ago and which had thrilled
and fascinated her Out out damned spot that was what the tall
fierce beautiful lady who had played the part of a queen had said
twisting her hands together just as the lodger was doing now

Its a fine day said Mr Sleuth sitting down and unfolding his
napkin The fog has cleared I do not know if you will agree with
me Mrs Bunting but I always feel brighter when the sun is shining
as it is now at any rate trying to shine He looked at her
inquiringly but Mrs Bunting could not speak She only nodded
However that did not affect Mr Sleuth adversely

He had acquired a great liking and respect for this wellbalanced
taciturn woman She was the first woman for whom he had experienced
any such feeling for many years past

He looked down at the still covered dish and shook his head I
dont feel as if I could eat very much today he said plaintively
And then he suddenly took a halfsovereign out of his waistcoat pocket

Already Mrs Bunting had noticed that it was not the same waistcoat
Mr Sleuth had been wearing the day before

Mrs Bunting may I ask you to come here

And after a moment of hesitation his landlady obeyed him

Will you please accept this little gift for the use you kindly
allowed me to make of your kitchen last night he said quietly
I tried to make as little mess as I could Mrs Bunting but
well the truth is I was carrying out a very elaborate experiment

Mrs Bunting held out her hand she hesitated and then she took
the coin The fingers which for a moment brushed lightly against
her palm were icy coldcold and clammy Mr Sleuth was evidently
not well

As she walked down the stairs the winter sun a scarlet ball
hanging in the smoky sky glinted in on Mr Sleuths landlady and
threw bloodred gleams or so it seemed to her on to the piece of
gold she was holding in her hand



The day went by as other days had gone by in that quiet household
but of course there was far greater animation outside the little
house than was usually the case

Perhaps because the sun was shining for the first time for some
days the whole of London seemed to be making holiday in that part
of the town

When Bunting at last came back his wife listened silently while he
told her of the extraordinary excitement reigning everywhere And
then after he had been talking a long while she suddenly shot a
strange look at him

I suppose you went to see the place she said

And guiltily he acknowledged that he had done so

Well

Well there wasnt anything much to seenot now But oh Ellen
the daring of him Why Ellen if the poor soul had had time to cry
outwhich they dont believe she hadits impossible someone
wouldnt a heard her They say that if he goes on doing it like
thatin the afternoon likehe never will be caught He must
have just got mixed up with all the other people within ten seconds
of what hed done

During the afternoon Bunting bought papers recklesslyin fact he
must have spent the best part of sixpence But in spite of all the
supposed and suggested clues there was nothingnothing at all new
to read less in fact than ever before

The police it was clear were quite at a loss and Mrs Bunting
began to feel curiously better less tired less ill lessless
terrified than she had felt through the morning

And then something happened which broke with dramatic suddenness the
quietude of the day

They had had their tea and Bunting was reading the last of the
papers he had run out to buy when suddenly there came a loud
thundering double knock at the door

Mrs Bunting looked up startled Why whoever can that be she
said

But as Bunting got up she added quickly You just sit down again
Ill go myself Sounds like someone after lodgings Ill soon send
them to the rightabout

And then she left the room but not before there had come another
loud double knock

Mrs Bunting opened the front door In a moment she saw that the
person who stood there was a stranger to her He was a big dark
man with fierce black moustaches And somehowshe could not
have told you whyhe suggested a policeman to Mrs Buntings mind

This notion of hers was confirmed by the very first words he uttered
For Im here to execute a warrant he exclaimed in a theatrical
hollow tone

With a weak cry of protest Mrs Bunting suddenly threw out her arms
as if to bar the way she turned deadly whitebut then in an
instant the supposed strangers laugh rang out with loud jovial
familiar sound

There now Mrs Bunting I never thought Id take you in as well
as all that

It was Joe ChandlerJoe Chandler dressed up as she knew he
sometimes not very often did dress up in the course of his work

Mrs Bunting began laughinglaughing helplessly hysterically
just as she had done on the morning of Daisys arrival when the
newspapersellers had come shouting down the Marylebone Road

Whats all this about Bunting came out

Young Chandler ruefully shut the front door I didnt mean to
upset her like this he said looking foolish twas just my silly
nonsense Mr Bunting And together they helped her into the
sittingroom

But once there poor Mrs Bunting went on worse than ever she
threw her black apron over her face and began to sob hysterically

I made sure shed know who I was when I spoke went on the young
fellow apologetically But there now I have upset her I am
sorry

It dont matter she exclaimed throwing the apron off her face
but the tears were still streaming from her eyes as she sobbed and
laughed by turns Dont matter one little bit Joe Twas stupid
of me to be so taken aback But there that murder thats happened
close by its just upset meupset me altogether today

Enough to upset anyonethat was acknowledged the young man
ruefully Ive only come in for a minute like I havent no
right to come when Im on duty like this

Joe Chandler was looking longingly at what remains of the meal were
still on the table

You can take a minute just to have a bite and a sup said Bunting
hospitably and then you can tell us any news there is Joe Were
right in the middle of everything now aint we He spoke with
evident enjoyment almost pride in the gruesome fact

Joe nodded Already his mouth was full of breadandbutter He
waited a moment and then Well I have got one piece of newsnot
that I suppose itll interest you very much

They both looked at himMrs Bunting suddenly calm though her
breast still heaved from time to time

Our Boss has resigned said Joe Chandler slowly impressively

No Not the Commissioner o Police exclaimed Bunting

Yes he has He just cant bear whats said about us any longer
and I dont wonder He done his best and sos we all The
public have just gone daftin the West End that is today As
for the papers well theyre something cruelthats what they
are And the ridiculous ideas they print Youd never believe the
things they asks us to doand quite seriouslike

What dyou mean questioned Mrs Bunting She really wanted to
know

Well the Courier declares that there ought to be a housetohouse
investigationall over London Just think of it Everybody to
let the police go all over their house from garret to kitchen
just to see if The Avenger isnt concealed there Dotty I calls
it Why twould take us months and months just to do that one
job in a town like London

Id like to see them dare come into my house said Mrs Bunting
angrily

Its all along of them blarsted papers that The Avenger went to
work a different way this time said Chandler slowly

Bunting had pushed a tin of sardines towards his guest and was
eagerly listening How dyou mean he asked I dont take
your meaning Joe

Well you see its this way The newspapers was always saying
how extraordinary it was that The Avenger chose such a peculiar
time to do his deedsI mean the time when no ones about the
streets Now doesnt it stand to reason that the fellow reading
all that and seeing the sense of it said to himself Ill go on
another tack this time Just listen to this He pulled a strip
of paper part of a column cut from a newspaper out of his pocket


AN EXLORD MAYOR OF LONDON ON THE AVENGER


Will the murderer be caught Yes replied Sir John he will
certainly be caughtprobably when he commits his next crime A
whole army of bloodhounds metaphorical and literal will be on his
track the moment he draws blood again With the whole community
against him he cannot escape especially when it be remembered that
he chooses the quietest hour in the twentyfour to commit his crimes

Londoners are now in such a state of nervesif I may use the
expression in such a state of funkthat every passerby however
innocent is looked at with suspicion by his neighbour if his
avocation happens to take him abroad between the hours of one and
three in the morning

Id like to gag that exLord Mayor concluded Joe Chandler
wrathfully

Just then the lodgers bell rang

Let me go up my dear said Bunting

His wife still looked pale and shaken by the fright she had had

No no she said hastily You stop down here and talk to Joe
Ill look after Mr Sleuth He may be wanting his supper just a
bit earlier than usual today

Slowly painfully again feeling as if her legs were made of cotton
wool she dragged herself up to the first floor knocked at the door
and then went in

You did ring sir she said in her quiet respectful way

And Mr Sleuth looked up

She thoughtbut as she reminded herself afterwards it might have
been just her idea and nothing elsethat for the first time the
lodger looked frightenedfrightened and cowed

I heard a noise downstairs he said fretfully and I wanted to
know what it was all about As I told you Mrs Bunting when I
first took these rooms quiet is essential to me

It was just a friend of ours sir Im sorry you were disturbed
Would you like the knocker taken off tomorrow Buntingll be
pleased to do it if you dont like to hear the sound of the knocks

Oh no I wouldnt put you to such trouble as that Mr Sleuth
looked quite relieved Just a friend of yours was it Mrs
Bunting He made a great deal of noise

Just a young fellow she said apologetically The son of one of
Buntings old friends He often comes here sir but he never did
give such a great big double knock as that before Ill speak to
him about it

Oh no Mrs Bunting I would really prefer you did nothing of
the kind It was just a passing annoyancenothing more

She waited a moment How strange that Mr Sleuth said nothing of
the hoarse cries which had made of the road outside a perfect Bedlam
every hour or two throughout that day But no Mr Sleuth made no
allusion to what might well have disturbed any quiet gentleman at
his reading

I thought maybe youd like to have supper a little earlier tonight
sir

Just when you like Mrs Buntingjust when its convenient I
do not wish to put you out in any way

She felt herself dismissed and going out quietly closed the door

As she did so she heard the front door banging to She sighed
Joe Chandler was really a very noisy young fellow



CHAPTER XVII

Mrs Bunting slept well the night following that during which the
lodger had been engaged in making his mysterious experiments in her
kitchen She was so tired so utterly exhausted that sleep came
to her the moment she laid her head upon her pillow

Perhaps that was why she rose so early the next morning Hardly
giving herself time to swallow the tea Bunting had made and brought
her she got up and dressed

She had suddenly come to the conclusion that the hall and staircase
required a thorough doing down and she did not even wait till
they had eaten their breakfast before beginning her labours It
made Bunting feel quite uncomfortable As he sat by the fire reading
his morning paperthe paper which was again of such absorbing
interesthe called out Theres no need for so much hurry Ellen
Daisyll be back today Why dont you wait till shes come home to
help you

But from the hall where she was busy dusting sweeping polishing
his wifes voice came back Girls aint no good at this sort of
work Dont you worry about me I feel as if Id enjoy doing an
extra bit of cleaning today I dont like to feel as anyone could
come in and see my place dirty

No fear of that Bunting chuckled And then a new thought struck
him Aint you afraid of waking the lodger he called out

Mr Sleuth slept most of yesterday and all last night she
answered quickly As it is I study him overmuch its a long
long time since Ive done this staircase down

All the time she was engaged in doing the hall Mrs Bunting left
the sittingroom door wide open

That was a queer thing of her to do but Bunting didnt like to get
up and shut her out as it were Still try as he would he couldnt
read with any comfort while all that noise was going on He had
never known Ellen make such a lot of noise before Once or twice he
looked up and frowned rather crossly

There came a sudden silence and he was startled to see that Ellen
was standing in the doorway staring at him doing nothing

Come in he said do Aint you finished yet

I was only resting a minute she said You dont tell me nothing
Id like to know if theres anythingI mean anything newin the
paper this morning

She spoke in a muffled voice almost as if she were ashamed of her
unusual curiosity and her look of fatigue of pallor made Bunting
suddenly uneasy Come indo he repeated sharply Youve
done quite enoughand before breakfast too Taint necessary
Come in and shut that door

He spoke authoritatively and his wife for a wonder obeyed him

She came in and did what she had never done beforebrought the
broom with her and put it up against the wall in the corner

Then she sat down

I think Ill make breakfast up here she said II feel cold
Bunting And her husband stared at her surprised for drops of
perspiration were glistening on her forehead

He got up All right Ill go down and bring the eggs up Dont
you worry For the matter of that I can cook them downstairs if
you like

No she said obstinately Id rather do my own work You just
bring them up herethatll be all right Tomorrow morning well
have Daisy to help see to things

Come over here and sit down comfortable in my chair he suggested
kindly You never do take any bit of rest Ellen I never seed
such a woman

And again she got up and meekly obeyed him walking across the room
with languid steps

He watched her anxiously uncomfortably

She took up the newspaper he had just laid down and Bunting took
two steps towards her

Ill show you the most interesting bit he said eagerly Its
the piece headed Our Special Investigator You see theyve
started a special investigator of their own and hes got hold of
a lot of little facts the police seem to have overlooked The man
who writes all thatI mean the Special Investigatorwas a
famous tec in his time and hes just come back out of his
retirement o purpose to do this bit of work for the paper You
read what he saysI shouldnt be a bit surprised if he ends by
getting that reward One can see he just loves the work of
tracking people down

Theres nothing to be proud of in such a job said his wife
listlessly

Hell have something to be proud of if he catches The Avenger
cried Bunting He was too keen about this affair to be put off
by Ellens contradictory remarks You just notice that bit about
the rubber soles Now no ones thought o that Ill just tell
Chandlerhe dont seem to me to be half awake that young man
dont

Hes quite wide awake enough without you saying things to him
How about those eggs Bunting I feel quite ready for my breakfast
even if you dont

Mrs Bunting now spoke in what her husband sometimes secretly
described to himself as Ellens snarling voice

He turned away and left the room feeling oddly troubled There
was something queer about her and he couldnt make it out He
didnt mind it when she spoke sharply and nastily to him He was
used to that But now she was so up and down so different from
what she used to be In old days she had always been the same but
now a man never knew where to have her

And as he went downstairs he pondered uneasily over his wifes
changed ways and manner

Take the question of his easy chair A very small matter no doubt
but he had never known Ellen sit in that chairno not even once
for a minute since it had been purchased by her as a present for him

They had been so happy so happy and soso restful during that
first week after Mr Sleuth had come to them Perhaps it was the
sudden dramatic change from agonising anxiety to peace and security
which had been too much for Ellenyes that was what was the matter
with her that and the universal excitement about these Avenger
murders which were shaking the nerves of all London Even Bunting
unobservant as he was had come to realise that his wife took a
morbid interest in these terrible happenings And it was the more
queer of her to do so that at first she refused to discuss them and
said openly that she was utterly uninterested in murder or crime of
any sort

He Bunting had always had a mild pleasure in such things In his
time he had been a great reader of detective tales and even now he
thought there was no pleasanter reading It was that which had first
drawn him to Joe Chandler and made him welcome the young chap as
cordially as he had done when they first came to London

But though Ellen had tolerated she had never encouraged that sort
of talk between the two men More than once she had exclaimed
reproachfully To hear you two one would think there was no nice
respectable quiet people left in the world

But now all that was changed She was as keen as anyone could be
to hear the latest details of an Avenger crime True she took her
own view of any theory suggested But there Ellen always had had
her own notions about everything under the sun Ellen was a woman
who thought for herselfa clever woman not an everyday woman by
any manner of means

While these thoughts were going disconnectedly through his mind
Bunting was breaking four eggs into a basin He was going to give
Ellen a nice little surpriseto cook an omelette as a French chef
had once taught him to do years and years ago He didnt know how
she would take his doing such a thing after what she had said but
never mind she would enjoy the omelette when done Ellen hadnt
been eating her food properly of late

And when he went up again his wife to his relief and it must be
admitted to his surprise took it very well She had not even
noticed how long he had been downstairs for she had been reading
with intense painful care the column that the great daily paper
they took in had allotted to the onetime famous detective

According to this Special Investigators own account he had
discovered all sorts of things that had escaped the eye of the
police and of the official detectives For instance owing he
admitted to a fortunate chance he had been at the place where
the two last murders had been committed very soon after the double
crime had been discoveredin fact within half an hour and he
had found or so he felt sure on the slippery wet pavement
imprints of the murderers right foot

The paper reproduced the impression of a halfworn rubber sole
At the same time he also admittedfor the Special Investigator
was very honest and he had a good bit of space to fill in the
enterprising paper which had engaged him to probe the awful
mysterythat there were thousands of rubber soles being worn in
London   

And when she came to that statement Mrs Bunting looked up and
there came a wan smile over her thin closelyshut lips It was
quite truethat about rubber soles there were thousands of
rubber soles being worn just now She felt grateful to the Special
Investigator for having stated the fact so clearly

The column ended up with the words

And today will take place the inquest on the double crime of ten
days ago To my mind it would be well if a preliminary public
inquiry could be held at once Say on the very day the discovery
of a fresh murder is made In that way alone would it be possible
to weigh and sift the evidence offered by members of the general
public For when a week or more has elapsed and these same people
have been examined and crossexamined in private by the police
their impressions have had time to become blurred and hopelessly
confused On that last occasion but one there seems no doubt
that several people at any rate two women and one man actually
saw the murderer hurrying from the scene of his atrocious double
crimethis being so todays investigation may be of the highest
value and importance Tomorrow I hope to give an account of
the impression made on me by the inquest and by any statements
made during its course

Even when her husband had come in with the tray Mrs Bunting had
gone on reading only lifting up her eyes for a moment At last he
said rather crossly Put down that paper Ellen this minute The
omelette Ive cooked for you will be just like leather if you dont
eat it

But once his wife had eaten her breakfastand to Buntings
mortification she left more than half the nice omelette untouched
she took the paper up again She turned over the big sheets
until she found at the foot of one of the ten columns devoted to
The Avenger and his crimes the information she wanted and then
uttered an exclamation under her breath

What Mrs Bunting had been looking forwhat at last she had found
was the time and place of the inquest which was to be held that
day The hour named was a rather odd timetwo oclock in the
afternoon but from Mrs Buntings point of view it was most
convenient

By two oclock nay by halfpast one the lodger would have had
his lunch by hurrying matters a little she and Bunting would have
had their dinner andand Daisy wasnt coming home till teatime

She got up out of her husbands chair I think youre right she
said in a quick hoarse tone I mean about me seeing a doctor
Bunting I think I will go and see a doctor this very afternoon

Wouldnt you like me to go with you he asked

No that I wouldnt In fact I wouldnt go at all you was to go
with me

All right he said vexedly Please yourself my dear you know
best

I should think I did know best where my own health is concerned

Even Bunting was incensed by this lack of gratitude Twas I said
long ago you ought to go and see the doctor twas you said you
wouldnt he exclaimed pugnaciously

Well Ive never said you was never right have I At any rate
Im going

Have you a pain anywhere He stared at her with a look of real
solicitude on his fat phlegmatic face

Somehow Ellen didnt look right standing there opposite him Her
shoulders seemed to have shrunk even her cheeks had fallen in a
little She had never looked so badnot even when they had been
half starving and dreadfully dreadfully worked

Yes she said briefly Ive a pain in my head at the back of
my neck It doesnt often leave me it gets worse when anything
upsets me like I was upset last night by Joe Chandler

He was a silly ass to come and do a thing like that said Bunting
crossly Id a good mind to tell him so too But I must say
Ellen I wonder he took you inhe didnt me

Well you had no chance he shouldyou knew who it was she said
slowly

And Bunting remained silent for Ellen was right Joe Chandler had
already spoken when he Bunting came out into the hall and saw
their cleverly disguised visitor

Those big black moustaches he went on complainingly and that
black wigwhy twas too ridiclousthats what I call it

Not to anyone who didnt know Joe she said sharply

Well I dont know He didnt look like a real mannohow If
hes a wise lad he wont let our Daisy ever see him looking like
that and Bunting laughed a comfortable laugh

He had thought a good deal about Daisy and young Chandler the last
two days and on the whole he was well pleased It was a dull
unnatural life the girl was leading with Old Aunt And Joe was
earning good money They wouldnt have long to wait these two
young people as a beau and his girl often have to wait as he
Bunting and Daisys mother had had to do for ever so long before
they could be married No there was no reason why they shouldnt
be spliced quite soonif so the fancy took them And Bunting
had very little doubt that so the fancy would take Joe at any rate

But there was plenty of time Daisy wouldnt be eighteen till the
week after next They might wait till she was twenty By that
time Old Aunt might be dead and Daisy might have come into quite
a tidy little bit of money

What are you smiling at said his wife sharply

And he shook himself Ismiling At nothing that I knows of
Then he waited a moment Well if you will know Ellen I was
just thinking of Daisy and that young chap Joe Chandler He is
gone on her aint he

Gone And then Mrs Bunting laughed a queer odd not unkindly
laugh Gone Bunting she repeated Why hes out o sight
right out of sight

Then hesitatingly and looking narrowly at her husband she went on
twisting a bit of her black apron with her fingers as she spoke
I suppose hell be going over this afternoon to fetch her Oror
dyou think hell have to be at that inquest Bunting

Inquest What inquest He looked at her puzzled

Why the inquest on them bodies found in the passage near by Kings
Cross

Oh no hed have no call to be at the inquest For the matter o
that I know hes going over to fetch Daisy He said so last night
just when you went up to the lodger

Thats just as well Mrs Bunting spoke with considerable
satisfaction Otherwise I suppose youd ha had to go I wouldnt
like the house leftnot with us out of it Mr Sleuth would be
upset if there came a ring at the door

Oh I wont leave the house dont you be afraid Ellennot while
youre out

Not even if Im out a good while Bunting

No fear Of course youll be a long time if its your idea to see
that doctor at Ealing

He looked at her questioningly and Mrs Bunting nodded Somehow
nodding didnt seem as bad as speaking a lie



CHAPTER XVIII

Any ordeal is far less terrifying far easier to meet with courage
when it is repeated than is even a milder experience which is
entirely novel

Mrs Bunting had already attended an inquest in the character of a
witness and it was one of the few happenings of her life which was
sharply etched against the somewhat blurred screen of her memory

In a country house where the then Ellen Green had been staying for
a fortnight with her elderly mistress there had occurred one of
those sudden pitiful tragedies which occasionally destroy the
serenity the apparent decorum of a large respectable household

The underhousemaid a pretty happynatured girl had drowned
herself for love of the footman who had given his sweetheart cause
for bitter jealousy The girl had chosen to speak of her troubles
to the strange ladys maid rather than to her own fellowservants
and it was during the conversation the two women had had together
that the girl had threatened to take her own life

As Mrs Bunting put on her outdoor clothes preparatory to going
out she recalled very clearly all the details of that dreadful
affair and of the part she herself had unwillingly played in it

She visualised the country inn where the inquest on that poor
unfortunate creature had been held

The butler had escorted her from the Hall for he also was to give
evidence and as they came up there had been a look of cheerful
animation about the inn yard people coming and going many women
as well as men village folk among whom the dead girls fate had
aroused a great deal of interest and the kind of horror which those
who live on a dull countryside welcome rather than avoid

Everyone there had been particularly nice and polite to her to
Ellen Green there had been a time of waiting in a room upstairs in
the old inn and the witnesses had been accommodated not only with
chairs but with cake and wine

She remembered how she had dreaded being a witness how she had
felt as if she would like to run away from her nice easy place
rather than have to get up and tell the little that she knew of the
sad business

But it had not been so very dreadful after all The coroner had
been a kindlyspoken gentleman in fact he had complimented her on
the clear sensible way she had given her evidence concerning the
exact words the unhappy girl had used

One thing Ellen Green had said in answer to a question put by
an inquisitive juryman had raised a laugh in the crowded
lowceilinged room Ought not Miss Ellen Green so the man had
asked to have told someone of the girls threat If she had done
so might not the girl have been prevented from throwing herself
into the lake And she the witness had answered with some
asperityfor by that time the coroners kind manner had put her
at her easethat she had not attached any importance to what the
girl had threatened to do never believing that any young woman
could be so silly as to drown herself for love



Vaguely Mrs Bunting supposed that the inquest at which she was
going to be present this afternoon would be like that country
inquest of long ago

It had been no mere perfunctory inquiry she remembered very well
how little by little that pleasantspoken gentleman the coroner
had got the whole truth outthe story that is of how that
horrid footman whom she Ellen Green had disliked from the first
minute she had set eyes on him had taken up with another young
woman It had been supposed that this fact would not be elicited
by the coroner but it had been quietly remorselessly more the
dead girls letters had been read outpiteous queerly expressed
letters full of wild love and bitter threatening jealousy And
the jury had censured the young man most severely she remembered
the look on his face when the people shrinking back had made a
passage for him to slink out of the crowded room

Come to think of it now it was strange she had never told Bunting
that longago tale It had occurred years before she knew him and
somehow nothing had ever happened to make her tell him about it

She wondered whether Bunting had ever been to an inquest She longed
to ask him But if she asked him now this minute he might guess
where she was thinking of going

And then while still moving about her bedroom she shook her head
no no Bunting would never guess such a thing he would never
never suspect her of telling him a lie

Stophad she told a lie She did mean to go to the doctor after
the inquest was finishedif there was time that is She wondered
uneasily how long such an inquiry was likely to last In this case
as so very little had been discovered the proceedings would surely
be very formalformal and therefore short

She herself had one quite definite objectthat of hearing the
evidence of those who believed they had seen the murderer leaving
the spot where his victims lay weltering in their still flowing
blood She was filled with a painful secret and yes eager
curiosity to hear how those who were so positive about the matter
would describe the appearance of The Avenger After all a lot of
people must have seen him for as Bunting had said only the day
before to young Chandler The Avenger was not a ghost he was a
living man with some kind of hidingplace where he was known and
where he spent his time between his awful crimes

As she came back to the sittingroom her extreme pallor struck her
husband

Why Ellen he said it is time you went to the doctor You
looks just as if you was going to a funeral Ill come along with
you as far as the station Youre going by train aint you Not
by bus eh Its a very long way to Ealing you know

There you go Breaking your solemn promise to me the very first
minute But somehow she did not speak unkindly only fretfully
and sadly

And Bunting hung his head Why to be sure Id gone and clean
forgot the lodger But will you be all right Ellen Why not wait
till tomorrow and take Daisy with you

I like doing my own business in my own way and not in someone
elses way she snapped out and then more gently for Bunting
really looked concerned and she did feel very far from well Ill
be all right old man Dont you worry about me

As she turned to go across to the door she drew the black shawl
she had put over her long jacket more closely round her

She felt ashamed deeply ashamed of deceiving so kind a husband
And yet what could she do How could she share her dreadful burden
with poor Bunting Why twould be enough to make a man go daft
Even she often felt as if she could stand it no longeras if she
would give the world to tell someoneanyonewhat it was that she
suspected what deep in her heart she so feared to be the truth

But unknown to herself the fresh outside air fogladen though it
was soon began to do her good She had gone out far too little the
last few days for she had had a nervous terror of leaving the house
unprotected as also a great unwillingness to allow Bunting to come
into contact with the lodger

When she reached the Underground station she stopped short There
were two ways of getting to St Pancrasshe could go by bus or
she could go by train She decided on the latter But before
turning into the station her eyes strayed over the bills of the
early afternoon papers lying on the ground

Two words

 THE AVENGER

stared up at her in varying type

Drawing her black shawl yet a little closer about her shoulders
Mrs Bunting looked down at the placards She did not feel inclined
to buy a paper as many of the people round her were doing Her eyes
were smarting even now from their unaccustomed following of the
close print in the paper Bunting took in

Slowly she turned at last into the Underground station

And now a piece of extraordinary good fortune befell Mrs Bunting

The thirdclass carriage in which she took her place happened to be
empty save for the presence of a police inspector And once they
were well away she summoned up courage and asked him the question
she knew she would have to ask of someone within the next few minutes

Can you tell me she said in a low voice where death inquests
are heldshe moistened her lips waited a moment and then
concludedin the neighbourhood of Kings Cross

The man turned and looked at her attentively She did not look at
all the sort of Londoner who goes to an inquestthere are many
suchjust for the fun of the thing Approvingly for he was a
widower he noted her neat black coat and skirt and the plain
Princess bonnet which framed her pale refined face

Im going to the Coroners Court myself he said goodnaturedly
So you can come along of me You see theres that big Avenger
inquest going on today so I think theyll have had to make other
arrangements forhum humordinary cases And as she looked
at him dumbly he went on Therell be a mighty crowd of people at
The Avenger inquesta lot of ticket folk to be accommodated to
say nothing of the public

Thats the inquest Im going to faltered Mrs Bunting She could
scarcely get the words out She realised with acute discomfort
yes and shame how strange how untoward was that which she was
going to do Fancy a respectable woman wanting to attend a murder
inquest

During the last few days all her perceptions had become sharpened
by suspense and fear She realised now as she looked into the
stolid face of her unknown friend how she herself would have
regarded any woman who wanted to attend such an inquiry from a
simple morbid feeling of curiosity And yetand yet that was
just what she was about to do herself

Ive got a reason for wanting to go there she murmured It was
a comfort to unburden herself this little way even to a stranger

Ah he said reflectively Aa relative connected with one of
the two victims husbands I presume

And Mrs Bunting bent her head

Going to give evidence he asked casually and then he turned and
looked at Mrs Bunting with far more attention than he had yet done

Oh no There was a world of horror of fear in the speakers voice

And the inspector felt concerned and sorry Hadnt seen her for
quite a long time I suppose

Never had seen her Im from the country Something impelled
Mrs Bunting to say these words But she hastily corrected herself
At least I was

Will he be there

She looked at him dumbly not in the least knowing to whom he was
alluding

I mean the husband went on the inspector hastily I felt sorry
for the last poor chapI mean the husband of the last onehe
seemed so awfully miserable You see shed been a good wife and a
good mother till she took to the drink

It always is so breathed out Mrs Bunting

Aye He waited a moment Dyou know anyone about the court he
asked

She shook her head

Well dont you worry Ill take you in along o me Youd never
get in by yourself

They got out and oh the comfort of being in some ones charge of
having a determined man in uniform to look after one And yet even
now there was to Mrs Bunting something dreamlike unsubstantial
about the whole business

If he knewif he only knew what I know she kept saying over
and over again to herself as she walked lightly by the big burly
form of the police inspector

Tisnt farnot three minutes he said suddenly Am I walking
too quick for you maam

No not at all Im a quick walker

And then suddenly they turned a corner and came on a mass of people
a densely packed crowd of men and women staring at a meanlooking
little door sunk into a high wall

Better take my arm the inspector suggested Make way there
Make way he cried authoritatively and he swept her through the
serried ranks which parted at the sound of his voice at the sight
of his uniform

Lucky you met me he said smiling Youd never have got
through alone And taint a nice crowd not by any manner of
means

The small door opened just a little way and they found themselves
on a narrow stoneflagged path leading into a square yard A few
men were out there smoking

Before preceding her into the building which rose at the back of
the yard Mrs Buntings kind new friend took out his watch
Theres another twenty minutes before theyll begin he said
Theres the mortuaryhe pointed with his thumb to a low room
built out to the right of the court Would you like to go in and
see them he whispered

Oh no she cried in a tone of extreme horror And he looked
down at her with sympathy and with increased respect She was a
nice respectable woman she was She had not come here imbued
with any morbid horrible curiosity but because she thought it
her duty to do so He suspected her of being sisterinlaw to
one of The Avengers victims

They walked through into a big room or hall now full of men
talking in subdued yet eager animated tones

I think youd better sit down here he said considerately and
leading her to one of the benches that stood out from the whitewashed
wallsunless youd rather be with the witnesses that is

But again she said Oh no And then with an effort Oughtnt
I to go into the court now if its likely to be so full

Dont you worry he said kindly Ill see you get a proper place
I must leave you now for a minute but Ill come back in good time
and look after you

She raised the thick veil she had pulled down over her face while
they were going through that sinister wolfishlooking crowd outside
and looked about her

Many of the gentlementhey mostly wore tall hats and good overcoats
standing round and about her looked vaguely familiar She picked
out one at once He was a famous journalist whose shrewd animated
face was familiar to her owing to the fact that it was widely
advertised in connection with a preparation for the hairthe
preparation which in happier more prosperous days Bunting had had
great faith in and used or so he always said with great benefit to
himself This gentleman was the centre of an eager circle half a
dozen men were talking to him listening deferentially when he spoke
and each of these men so Mrs Bunting realised was a Somebody

How strange how amazing to reflect that from all parts of London
from their doubtless important avocations one unseen mysterious
beckoner had brought all these men here together to this sordid
place on this bitterly cold dreary day Here they were all
thinking of talking of evoking one unknown mysterious personality
that of the shadowy and yet terribly real human being who chose
to call himself The Avenger And somewhere not so very far away
from them all The Avenger was keeping these clever astute highly
trained mindsaye and bodies tooat bay

Even Mrs Bunting sitting here unnoticed realised the irony of her
presence among them



CHAPTER XIX

It seemed to Mrs Bunting that she had been sitting there a long
timeit was really about a quarter of an hourwhen her official
friend came back

Better come along now he whispered itll begin soon

She followed him out into a passage up a row of steep stone steps
and so into the Coroners Court

The court was big welllighted room in some ways not unlike a
chapel the more so that a kind of gallery ran halfway round a
gallery evidently set aside for the general public for it was now
crammed to its utmost capacity

Mrs Bunting glanced timidly towards the serried row of faces Had
it not been for her good fortune in meeting the man she was now
following it was there that she would have had to try and make her
way And she would have failed Those people had rushed in the
moment the doors were opened pushing fighting their way in a way
she could never have pushed or fought

There were just a few women among them set determinedlooking
women belonging to every class but made one by their love of
sensation and their power of forcing their way in where they wanted
to be But the women were few the great majority of those standing
there were menmen who were also representative of every class of
Londoner

The centre of the court was like an arena it was sunk two or three
steps below the surrounding gallery Just now it was comparatively
clear of people save for the benches on which sat the men who were
to compose the jury Some way from these men huddled together in
a kind of big pew stood seven peoplethree women and four men

Dyou see the witnesses whispered the inspector pointing these
out to her He supposed her to know one of them with familiar
knowledge but if that were so she made no sign

Between the windows facing the whole room was a kind of little
platform on which stood a desk and an armchair Mrs Bunting
guessed rightly that it was there the coroner would sit And to
the left of the platform was the witnessstand also raised
considerably above the jury

Amazingly different and far far more grim and aweinspiring than
the scene of the inquest which had taken place so long ago on that
bright April day in the village inn There the coroner had sat on
the same level as the jury and the witnesses had simply stepped
forward one by one and taken their place before him

Looking round her fearfully Mrs Bunting thought she would surely
die if ever she were exposed to the ordeal of standing in that
curious boxlike stand and she stared across at the bench where sat
the seven witnesses with a feeling of sincere pity in her heart

But even she soon realised that her pity was wasted Each woman
witness looked eager excited and animated well pleased to be the
centre of attention and attraction to the general public It was
plain each was enjoying her part of important if humble actress
in the thrilling drama which was now absorbing the attention of all
Londonit might almost be said of the whole world

Looking at these women Mrs Bunting wondered vaguely which was
which Was it that rather draggletailedlooking young person who
had certainly or almost certainly seen The Avenger within ten
seconds of the double crime being committed The woman who aroused
by one of his victims cry of terror had rushed to her window and
seen the murderers shadowy form pass swiftly by in the fog

Yet another woman so Mrs Bunting now remembered had given a most
circumstantial account of what The Avenger looked like for he it
was supposed had actually brushed by her as he passed

Those two women now before her had been interrogated and
crossexamined again and again not only by the police but by
representatives of every newspaper in London It was from what they
had both saidunluckily their accounts materially differedthat
that official description of The Avenger had been worked upthat
which described him as being a goodlooking respectable young fellow
of twentyeight carrying a newspaper parcel

As for the third woman she was doubtless an acquaintance a boon
companion of the dead

Mrs Bunting looked away from the witnesses and focused her gaze
on another unfamiliar sight Specially prominent running indeed
through the whole length of the shutin space that is from the
coroners high dais right across to the opening in the wooden barrier
was an inksplashed table at which when she had first taken her
place there had been sitting three men busily sketching but now
every seat at the table was occupied by tired intelligentlooking
men each with a notebook or with some loose sheets of paper
before him

Thems the reporters whispered her friend They dont like
coming till the last minute for they has to be the last to go
At an ordinary inquest there are only twomaybe threeattending
but now every paper in the kingdom has pretty well applied for a
pass to that reporters table

He looked consideringly down into the well of the court Now let
me see what I can do for you

Then he beckoned to the coroners officer Perhaps you could put
this lady just over there in a corner by herself Related to a
relation of the deceased but doesnt want to be He whispered
a word or two and the other nodded sympathetically and looked at
Mrs Bunting with interest Ill put her just here he muttered
Theres no one coming there today You see there are only seven
witnessessometimes we have a lot more than that

And he kindly put her on a now empty bench opposite to where the
seven witnesses stood and sat with their eager set faces ready
aye more than readyto play their part

For a moment every eye in the court was focused on Mrs Bunting but
soon those who had stared so hungrily so intently at her realised
that she had nothing to do with the case She was evidently there
as a spectator and more fortunate than most she had a friend at
court and so was able to sit comfortably instead of having to
stand in the crowd

But she was not long left in isolation Very soon some of the
importantlooking gentlemen she had seen downstairs came into the
court and were ushered over to her seat while two or three among
them including the famous writer whose face was so familiar that
it almost seemed to Mrs Bunting like that of a kindly acquaintance
were accommodated at the reporters table

Gentlemen the Coroner

The jury stood up shuffling their feet and then sat down again
over the spectators there fell a sudden silence

And then what immediately followed recalled to Mrs Bunting for the
first time that informal little country inquest of long ago

First came the Oyez Oyez the old NormanFrench summons to all
whose business it is to attend a solemn inquiry into the death
sudden unexplained terribleof a fellowbeing

The jurythere were fourteen of themall stood up again They
raised their hands and solemnly chanted together the curious words
of their oath

Then came a quick informal exchange of sentences twixt the coroner
and his officer

Yes everything was in order The jury had viewed the bodieshe
quickly corrected himselfthe body for technically speaking the
inquest just about to be held only concerned one body

And then amid a silence so absolute that the slightest rustle could
be heard through the court the coronera cleverlooking gentleman
though not so old as Mrs Bunting thought he ought to have been to
occupy so important a position on so important a daygave a little
history as it were of the terrible and mysterious Avenger crimes

He spoke very clearly warming to his work as he went on

He told them that he had been present at the inquest held on one of
The Avengers former victims I only went through professional
curiosity he threw in by way of parenthesis little thinking
gentlemen that the inquest on one of these unhappy creatures would
ever be held in my court

On and on he went though he had in truth but little to say and
though that little was known to every one of his listeners

Mrs Bunting heard one of the older gentlemen sitting near her
whisper to another Drawing it out all he can thats what hes
doing Having the time of his life evidently And then the other
whispered back so low that she could only just catch the words
Aye aye But hes a good chapI knew his father we were at
school together Takes his job very seriously you knowhe does
today at any rate



She was listening intently waiting for a word a sentence which
would relieve her hidden terrors or on the other hand confirm
them But the word the sentence was never uttered

And yet at the very end of his long peroration the coroner did
throw out a hint which might mean anythingor nothing

I am glad to say that we hope to obtain such evidence today as
will in time lead to the apprehension of the miscreant who has
committed and is still committing these terrible crimes

Mrs Bunting stared uneasily up into the coroners firm
determinedlooking face What did he mean by that Was there any
new evidenceevidence of which Joe Chandler for instance was
ignorant And as if in answer to the unspoken question her heart
gave a sudden leap for a big burly man had taken his place in the
witnessboxa policeman who had not been sitting with the other
witnesses

But soon her uneasy terror became stilled This witness was simply
the constable who had found the first body In quick businesslike
tones he described exactly what had happened to him on that cold
foggy morning ten days ago He was shown a plan and he marked it
slowly carefully with a thick finger That was the exact place
no he was making a mistakethat was the place where the other
body had lain He explained apologetically that he had got rather
mixed up between the two bodiesthat of Johanna Cobbett and Sophy
Hurtle

And then the coroner intervened authoritatively For the purpose
of this inquiry he said we must I think for a moment consider
the two murders together

After that the witness went on far more comfortably and as he
proceeded in a quick monotone the full and deadly horror of
The Avengers acts came over Mrs Bunting in a great seething flood
of sick fear andand yes remorse

Up to now she had given very little thoughtif indeed any thought
to the drinksodden victims of The Avenger It was he who had
filled her thoughtshe and those who were trying to track him down
But now Now she felt sick and sorry she had come here today She
wondered if she would ever be able to get the vision the policemans
words had conjured up out of her mindout of her memory

And then there came an eager stir of excitement and of attention
throughout the whole court for the policeman had stepped down out of
the witnessbox and one of the women witnesses was being conducted to
his place

Mrs Bunting looked with interest and sympathy at the woman
remembering how she herself had trembled with fear trembled as that
poor bedraggled commonlooking person was trembling now The woman
had looked so cheerful soso well pleased with herself till a
minute ago but now she had become very pale and she looked round
her as a hunted animal might have done

But the coroner was very kind very soothing and gentle in his
manner just as that other coroner had been when dealing with Ellen
Green at the inquest on that poor drowned girl

After the witness had repeated in a toneless voice the solemn words
of the oath she began to be taken step by step though her story
At once Mrs Bunting realised that this was the woman who claimed
to have seen The Avenger from her bedroom window Gaining confidence
as she went on the witness described how she had heard a longdrawn
stifled screech and aroused from deep sleep had instinctively
jumped out of bed and rushed to her window

The coroner looked down at something lying on his desk Let me
see Here is the plan YesI think I understand that the house
in which you are lodging exactly faces the alley where the two crimes
were committed

And there arose a quick futile discussion The house did not face
the alley but the window of the witnesss bedroom faced the alley

A distinction without a difference said the coroner testily
And now tell us as clearly and quickly as you can what you saw when
you looked out

There fell a dead silence on the crowded court And then the woman
broke out speaking more volubly and firmly than she had yet done
I saw im she cried I shall never forget itno not till my
dying day And she looked round defiantly

Mrs Bunting suddenly remembered a chat one of the newspaper men had
had with a person who slept under this womans room That person
had unkindly said she felt sure that Lizzie Cole had not got up that
nightthat she had made up the whole story She the speaker slept
lightly and that night had been tending a sick child Accordingly
she would have heard if there had been either the scream described
by Lizzie Cole or the sound of Lizzie Cole jumping out of bed

We quite understand that you think you saw thethe coroner
hesitatedthe individual who had just perpetrated these terrible
crimes But what we want to have from you is a description of him
In spite of the foggy atmosphere about which all are agreed you
say you saw him distinctly walking along for some yards below your
window Now please try and tell us what he was like

The woman began twisting and untwisting the corner of a coloured
handkerchief she held in her hand

Let us begin at the beginning said the coroner patiently What
sort of a hat was this man wearing when you saw him hurrying from
the passage

It was just a black at said the witness at last in a husky
rather anxious tone

Yesjust a black hat And a coatwere you able to see what
sort of a coat he was wearing

E adnt got no coat she said decidedly No coat at all I
remembers that very perticulerly I thought it queer as it was
so coldeverybody as can wears some sort o coat this weather

A juryman who had been looking at a strip of newspaper and
apparently not attending at all to what the witness was saying here
jumped up and put out his hand

Yes the coroner turned to him

I just want to say that this ere witnessif her name is Lizzie
Cole began by saying The Avenger was wearing a coata big heavy
coat Ive got it here in this bit of paper

I never said so cried the woman passionately I was made to
say all those things by the young man what came to me from the
Evening Sun Just put in what e liked in is paper e didnot
what I said at all

At this there was some laughter quickly suppressed

In future said the coroner severely addressing the juryman who
had now sat down again you must ask any question you wish to ask
through your foreman and please wait till I have concluded my
examination of the witness

But this interruption thisthis accusation had utterly upset
the witness She began contradicting herself hopelessly The man
she had seen hurrying by in the semidarkness below was tallno
he was short He was thinno he was a stoutish young man And
as to whether he was carrying anything there was quite an
acrimonious discussion

Most positively most confidently the witness declared that she had
seen a newspaper parcel under his arm it had bulged out at the back
so she declared But it was proved very gently and firmly that
she had said nothing of the kind to the gentleman from Scotland Yard
who had taken down her first accountin fact to him she had
declared confidently that the man had carried nothingnothing at
all that she had seen his arms swinging up and down

One factif fact it could be calledthe coroner did elicit
Lizzie Cole suddenly volunteered the statement that as he had passed
her window he had looked up at her This was quite a new statement

He looked up at you repeated the coroner You said nothing of
that in your examination

I said nothink because I was scarednigh scared to death

If you could really see his countenance for we know the night was
dark and foggy will you please tell me what he was like

But the coroner was speaking casually his hand straying over his
desk not a creature in that court now believed the womans story

Dark she answered dramatically Dark almost black If you can
take my meaning with a sort of nigger look

And then there was a titter Even the jury smiled And sharply the
coroner bade Lizzie Cole stand down

Far more credence was given to the evidence of the next witness

This was an older quieterlooking woman decently dressed in black
Being the wife of a night watchman whose work lay in a big warehouse
situated about a hundred yards from the alley or passage where the
crimes had taken place she had gone out to take her husband some
food he always had at one in the morning And a man had passed her
breathing hard and walking very quickly Her attention had been
drawn to him because she very seldom met anyone at that hour and
because he had such an odd peculiar look and manner

Mrs Bunting listening attentively realised that it was very much
from what this witness had said that the official description of The
Avenger had been composedthat description which had brought such
comfort to her Ellen Buntings soul

This witness spoke quietly confidently and her account of the
newspaper parcel the man was carrying was perfectly clear and
positive

It was a neat parcel she said done up with string

She had thought it an odd thing for a respectably dressed young man
to carry such a parcelthat was what had made her notice it But
when pressed she had to admit that it had been a very foggy night
so foggy that she herself had been afraid of losing her way
though every step was familiar

When the third woman went into the box and with sighs and tears
told of her acquaintance with one of the deceased with Johanna
Cobbett there was a stir of sympathetic attention But she had
nothing to say throwing any light on the investigation save that
she admitted reluctantly that Anny would have been such a nice
respectable young woman if it hadnt been for the drink

Her examination was shortened as much as possible and so was that
of the next witness the husband of Johanna Cobbett He was a very
respectablelooking man a foreman in a big business house at Croydon
He seemed to feel his position most acutely He hadnt seen his
wife for two years he hadnt had news of her for six months Before
she took to drink she had been an admirable wife andand yes
mother

Yet another painful few minutes to anyone who had a heart or
imagination to understand was spent when the father of the murdered
woman was in the box He had had later news of his unfortunate
daughter than her husband had had but of course he could throw no
light at all on her murder or murderer

A barman who had served both the women with drink just before the
publichouse closed for the night was handled rather roughly He
had stepped with a jaunty air into the box and came out of it
looking cast down uneasy

And then there took place a very dramatic because an utterly
unexpected incident It was one of which the evening papers made
the utmost much to Mrs Buntings indignation But neither coroner
nor juryand they after all were the people who mattered
thought a great deal of it

There had come a pause in the proceedings All seven witnesses had
been heard and a gentleman near Mrs Bunting whispered They are
now going to call Dr Gaunt Hes been in every big murder case for
the last thirty years Hes sure to have something interesting to
say It was really to hear him I came

But before Dr Gaunt had time even to get up from the seat with
which he had been accommodated close to the coroner there came a
stir among the general public or rather among those spectators
who stood near the low wooden door which separated the official
part of the court from the gallery

The coroners officer with an apologetic air approached the
coroner and handed him up an envelope And again in an instant
there fell absolute silence on the court

Looking rather annoyed the coroner opened the envelope He glanced
down the sheet of notepaper it contained Then he looked up

Mr then he glanced down again MrahMris it Cannot
he said doubtfully may come forward

There ran a titter though the spectators and the coroner frowned

A neat jauntylooking old gentleman in a nice furlined overcoat
with a fresh red face and white sidewhiskers was conducted from
the place where he had been standing among the general public to
the witnessbox

This is somewhat out of order MrerCannot said the
coroner severely You should have sent me this note before the
proceedings began This gentleman he said addressing the jury
informs me that he has something of the utmost importance to
reveal in connection with our investigation

I have remained silentI have locked what I knew within my own
breastbegan Mr Cannot in a quavering voice because I am so
afraid of the Press I knew if I said anything even to the police
that my house would be besieged by reporters and newspaper men   
I have a delicate wife Mr Coroner Such a state of thingsthe
state of things I imaginemight cause her deathindeed I hope
she will never read a report of these proceedings Fortunately she
has an excellent trained nurse

You will now take the oath said the coroner sharply He already
regretted having allowed this absurd person to have his say

Mr Cannot took the oath with a gravity and decorum which had been
lacking in most of those who had preceded him

I will address myself to the jury he began

You will do nothing of the sort broke in the coroner Now
please attend to me You assert in your letter that you know who
is thethe

The Avenger put in Mr Cannot promptly

The perpetrator of these crimes You further declare that you met
him on the very night he committed the murder we are now
investigating

I do so declare said Mr Cannot confidently Though in the best
of health myselfhe beamed round the court a now amused
attentive courtit is my fate to be surrounded by sick people to
have only ailing friends I have to trouble you with my private
affairs Mr Coroner in order to explain why I happened to be out
at so undue an hour as one oclock in the morning

Again a titter ran through the court Even the jury broke into
broad smiles

Yes went on the witness solemnly I was with a sick friendin
fact I may say a dying friend for since then he has passed away
I will not reveal my exact dwellingplace you sir have it on my
notepaper It is not necessary to reveal it but you will understand
me when I say that in order to come home I had to pass through a
portion of the Regents Park and it was thereto be exact about
the middle of Princes Terracewhen a very peculiarlooking
individual stopped and accosted me

Mrs Buntings hand shot up to her breast A feeling of deadly fear
took possession of her

I mustnt faint she said to herself hurriedly I mustnt faint
Whatevers the matter with me She took out her bottle of
smellingsalts and gave it a good long sniff

He was a grim gaunt man was this stranger Mr Coroner with a
very oddlooking face I should say an educated manin common
parlance a gentleman What drew my special attention to him was
that he was talking aloud to himselfin fact he seemed to be
repeating poetry I give you my word I had no thought of The
Avenger no thought at all To tell you the truth I thought this
gentleman was a poor escaped lunatic a man whod got away from his
keeper The Regents Park sir as I need hardly tell you is a
most quiet and soothing neighbourhood

And then a member of the general public gave a loud guffaw

I appeal to you sir the old gentleman suddenly cried out to
protect me from this unseemly levity I have not come here with
any other object than that of doing my duty as a citizen

I must ask you to keep to what is strictly relevant said the
coroner stiffly Time is going on and I have another important
witness to calla medical witness Kindly tell me as shortly as
possible what made you suppose that this stranger could possibly
be with an effort he brought out for the first time since the
proceedings began the words The Avenger

I am coming to that said Mr Cannot hastily I am coming to
that Bear with me a little longer Mr Coroner It was a foggy
night but not as foggy as it became later And just when we were
passing one another I and this man who was talking aloud to
himselfhe instead of going on stopped and turned towards
me That made me feel queer and uncomfortable the more so that
there was a very wild mad look on his face I said to him as
soothingly as possible A very foggy night sir And he said
Yesyes it is a foggy night a night fit for the commission of
dark and salutary deeds A very strange phrase sir thatdark
and salutary deeds He looked at the coroner expectantly

Well Well Mr Cannot Was that all Did you see this person
go off in the direction ofof Kings Cross for instance

No Mr Cannot reluctantly shook his head No I must honestly
say I did not He walked along a certain way by my side and then
he crossed the road and was lost in the fog

That will do said the coroner He spoke more kindly I thank
you Mr Cannot for coming here and giving us what you evidently
consider important information

Mr Cannot bowed a funny little oldfashioned bow and again some
of those present tittered rather foolishly

As he was stepping down from the witnessbox he turned and looked
up at the coroner opening his lips as he did so There was a
murmur of talking going on but Mrs Bunting at any rate heard
quite distinctly what it was that he said

One thing I have forgotten sir which may be of importance The
man carried a baga rather lightcoloured leather bag in his left
hand It was such a bag sir as might well contain a longhandled
knife

Mrs Bunting looked at the reporters table She remembered suddenly
that she had told Bunting about the disappearance of Mr Sleuths bag
And then a feeling of intense thankfulness came over her not a
single reporter at the long inkstained table had put down that last
remark of Mr Cannot In fact not one of them had heard it

Again the last witness put up his hand to command attention And
then silence did fall on the court

One word more he said in a quavering voice May I ask to be
accommodated with a seat for the rest of the proceedings I see
there is some room left on the witnesses bench And without
waiting for permission he nimbly stepped across and sat down

Mrs Bunting looked up startled Her friend the inspector was
bending over her

Perhaps youd like to come along now he said urgentlyI
dont suppose you want to hear the medical evidence Its always
painful for a female to hear that And therell be an awful rush
when the inquests over I could get you away quietly now

She rose and pulling her veil down over her pale face followed
him obediently

Down the stone staircase they went and through the big now empty
room downstairs

Ill let you out the back way he said I expect youre tired
maam and will like to get home to a cup o tea

I dont know how to thank you There were tears in her eyes
She was trembling with excitement and emotion You have been good
to me

Oh thats nothing he said a little awkwardly I expect you
went though a pretty bad time didnt you

Will they be having that old gentleman again she spoke in a
whisper and looked up at him with a pleading agonised look

Good Lord no Crazy old fool Were troubled with a lot of
those sort of people you know maam and they often do have funny
names too You see that sort is busy all their lives in the City
or what not then they retires when they gets about sixty and
theyre fit to hang themselves with dulness Why theres hundreds
of lunies of the sort to be met in London You cant go about at
night and not meet em Plenty of em

Then you dont think there was anything in what he said she
ventured

In what that old gent said Goodnessno he laughed
goodnaturedly But Ill tell you what I do think If it wasnt
for the time that had gone by I should believe that the second
witness had seen that crafty devil he lowered his voice But
there Dr Gaunt declares most positivelyso did two other medical
gentlementhat the poor creatures had been dead hours when they
was found Medical gentlemen are always very positive about their
evidence They have to beotherwise whod believe em If wed
time I could tell you of a case in whichwell twas all because
of Dr Gaunt that the murderer escaped We all knew perfectly well
the man we caught did it but he was able to prove an alibi as to
the time Dr Gaunt said the poor soul was killed



CHAPTER XX

It was not late even now for the inquest had begun very punctually
but Mrs Bunting felt that no power on earth should force her to go
to Ealing She felt quite tired out and as if she could think of
nothing

Pacing along very slowly as if she were an old old woman she
began listlessly turning her steps towards home Somehow she felt
that it would do her more good to stay out in the air than take the
train Also she would thus put off the momentthe moment to which
she looked forward with dread and dislikewhen she would have to
invent a circumstantial story as to what she had said to the doctor
and what the doctor had said to her

Like most men and women of his class Bunting took a great interest
in other peoples ailments the more interest that he was himself so
remarkably healthy He would feel quite injured if Ellen didnt
tell him everything that had happened everything that is that the
doctor had told her

As she walked swiftly along at every corner or so it seemed to her
and outside every publichouse stood eager boys selling the latest
edition of the afternoon papers to equally eager buyers Avenger
Inquest they shouted exultantly All the latest evidence At
one place where there were a row of contentsbills pinned to the
pavement by stones she stopped and looked down Opening of the
Avenger Inquest What is he really like Full description On yet
another ran the ironic query Avenger Inquest Do you know him

And as that facetious question stared up at her in huge print Mrs
Bunting turned sickso sick and faint that she did what she had
never done before in her lifeshe pushed her way into a
publichouse and putting two pennies down on the counter asked
for and received a glass of cold water

As she walked along the now gaslit streets she found her mind
dwelling persistentlynot on the inquest at which she had been
present not even on The Avenger but on his victims

Shudderingly she visualised the two cold bodies lying in the
mortuary She seemed also to see that third body which though
cold must yet be warmer than the other two for at this time
yesterday The Avengers last victim had been alive poor soul
alive and according to a companion of hers whom the papers had
already interviewed particularly merry and bright

Hitherto Mrs Bunting had been spared in any real sense a vision of
The Avengers victims Now they haunted her and she wondered
wearily if this fresh horror was to be added to the terrible fear
which encompassed her night and day

As she came within sight of home her spirit suddenly lightened
The narrow drabcoloured little house flanked each side by others
exactly like it in every single particular save that their front
yards were not so well kept looked as if it could aye and would
keep any secret closely hidden

For a moment at any rate The Avengers victims receded from her
mind She thought of them no more All her thoughts were
concentrated on BuntingBunting and Mr Sleuth She wondered what
had happened during her absencewhether the lodger had rung his
bell and if so how he had got on with Bunting and Bunting with
him

She walked up the little flagged path wearily and yet with a
pleasant feeling of homecoming And then she saw that Bunting must
have been watching for her behind the now closely drawn curtains
for before she could either knock or ring he had opened the door

I was getting quite anxious about you he exclaimed Come in
Ellen quick You must be fair perished a day like nowand you
out so little as you are Well I hope you found the doctor all
right He looked at her with affectionate anxiety

And then there came a sudden happy thought to Mrs Bunting No
she said slowly Doctor Evans wasnt in I waited and waited and
waited but he never came in at all Twas my own fault she added
quickly Even at such a moment as this she told herself that though
she had in a sort of way a kind of right to lie to her husband
she had no sight to slander the doctor who had been so kind to her
years ago I ought to have sent him a card yesterday night she
said Of course I was a fool to go all that way just on chance
of finding a doctor in It stands to reason theyve got to go out
to people at all times of day

I hope they gave you a cup of tea he said

And again she hesitated debating a point with herself if the
doctor had a decent sort of servant of course she Ellen Bunting
would have been offered a cup of tea especially if she explained
shed known him a long time

She compromised I was offered some she said in a weak tired
voice But there Bunting I didnt feel as if I wanted it Id
be very grateful for a cup nowif youd just make it for me over
the ring

Course I will he said eagerly You just come in and sit down
my dear Dont trouble to take your things off nowwait till
youve had tea

And she obeyed him Wheres Daisy she asked suddenly I thought
the girl would be back by the time I got home

She aint coming home todaythere was an odd sly smiling look
on Buntings face

Did she send a telegram asked Mrs Bunting

No Young Chandlers just come in and told me Hes been over
there andwould you believe it Ellenhes managed to make
friends with Margaret Wonderful what love will do aint it He
went over there just to help Daisy carry her bag back you know
and then Margaret told him that her lady had sent her some money
to go to the play and she actually asked Joe to go with them this
eveningshe and Daisyto the pantomime Did you ever hear o
such a thing

Very nice for them Im sure said Mrs Bunting absently But
she was pleasedpleased to have her mind taken off herself Then
when is that girl coming home she asked patiently

Well it appears that Chandlers got tomorrow morning off too
this evening and tomorrow morning Hell be on duty all night
but he proposes to go over and bring Daisy back in time for early
dinner Will that suit you Ellen

Yes Thatll be all right she said I dont grudge the girl
her bit of pleasure Ones only young once By the way did the
lodger ring while I was out

Bunting turned round from the gasring which he was watching to
see the kettle boil No he said Come to think of it its
rather a funny thing but the truth is Ellen I never gave Mr
Sleuth a thought You see Chandler came in and was telling me all
about Margaret laughinglike and then something else happened
while you was out Ellen

Something else happened she said in a startled voice Getting
up from her chair she came towards her husband What happened
Who came

Just a message for me asking if I could go tonight to wait at a
young ladys birthday party In Hanover Terrace it is A waiter
one of them nasty Swiss fellows as works for nothingfell out
just at the last minute and so they had to send for me

His honest face shone with triumph The man who had taken over his
old friends business in Baker Street had hitherto behaved very
badly to Bunting and that though Bunting had been on the books for
ever so long and had always given every satisfaction But this new
man had never employed himno not once

I hope you didnt make yourself too cheap said his wife jealously

No that I didnt I humd and hawd a lot and I could see the
fellow was quite worriedin fact at the end he offered me
halfacrown more So I graciously consented

Husband and wife laughed more merrily than they had done for a long
time

You wont mind being alone here I dont count the lodgerhes
no good Bunting looked at her anxiously He was only prompted
to ask the question because lately Ellen had been so queer so
unlike herself Otherwise it never would have occurred to him that
she could be afraid of being alone in the house She had often been
so in the days when he got more jobs

She stared at him a little suspiciously I be afraid she echoed
Certainly not Why should I be Ive never been afraid before
What dyou exactly mean by that Bunting

Oh nothing I only thought you might feel funnylike all alone
on this ground floor You was so upset yesterday when that young
fool Chandler came dressed up to the door

I shouldnt have been frightened if hed just been an ordinary
stranger she said shortly He said something silly to mejust
in keeping with his characterlike and it upset me Besides I
feel better now

As she was sipping gratefully her cup of tea there came a noise
outside the shouts of newspapersellers

Ill just run out said Bunting apologetically and see what
happened at that inquest today Besides they may have a clue
about the horrible affair last night Chandler was full of it
when he wasnt talking about Daisy and Margaret that is Hes
on tonight luckily not till twelve oclock plenty of time to
escort the two of em back after the play Besides he said
hell put them into a cab and blow the expense if the panto
goes on too long for him to take em home

On tonight repeated Mrs Bunting Whatever for

Well you see The Avengers always done em in couples so to
speak Theyve got an idea that hell have a try again tonight
However even so Joes only on from midnight till five oclock
Then hell go and turn in a bit before going off to fetch Daisy
Fine thing to be young aint it Ellen

I cant believe that hed go out on such a night as this

What do you mean said Bunting staring at her Ellen had spoken
so oddly as if to herself and in so fierce and passionate a tone

What do I mean she repeatedand a great fear clutched at her
heart What had she said She had been thinking aloud

Why by saying he wont go out Of course he has to go out
Besides hell have been to the play as it is Twould be a pretty
thing if the police didnt go out just because it was cold

II was thinking of The Avenger said Mrs Bunting She looked
at her husband fixedly Somehow she had felt impelled to utter
those true words

He dont take no heed of heat nor cold said Bunting sombrely
I take it the mans dead to all human feelingsaving of
course revenge

So thats your idea about him is it She looked across at her
husband Somehow this dangerous this perilous conversation between
them attracted her strangely She felt as if she must go on with it
Dyou think he was the man that woman said she saw That young
man what passed her with a newspaper parcel

Let me see he said slowly I thought that twas from the bedroom
window a woman saw him

No no I mean the other woman what was taking her husbands
breakfast to him in the warehouse She was far the most
respectablelooking woman of the two said Mrs Bunting impatiently

And then seeing her husbands look of utter blank astonishment
she felt a thrill of unreasoning terror She must have gone suddenly
mad to have said what she did Hurriedly she got up from her chair
There now she said here I am gossiping all about nothing when
I ought to be seeing about the lodgers supper It was someone in
the train talked to me about that person as thinks she saw The
Avenger

Without waiting for an answer she went into her bedroom lit the
gas and shut the door A moment later she heard Bunting go out to
buy the paper they had both forgotten during their dangerous
discussion

As she slowly languidly took off her nice warm coat and shawl
Mrs Bunting found herself shivering It was dreadfully cold quite
unnaturally cold even for the time of year

She looked longingly towards the fireplace It was now concealed
by the washhandstand but how pleasant it would be to drag that
stand aside and light a bit of fire especially as Bunting was going
to be out tonight He would have to put on his dress clothes and
she didnt like his dressing in the sittingroom It didnt suit
her ideas that he should do so How if she did light the fire here
in their bedroom It would be nice for her to have bit of fire to
cheer her up after he had gone

Mrs Bunting knew only too well that she would have very little
sleep the coming night She looked over with shuddering distaste
at her nice soft bed There she would lie on that couch of little
ease listeninglistening   

She went down to the kitchen Everything was ready for Mr Sleuths
supper for she had made all her preparations before going out so
as not to have to hurry back before it suited her to do so

Leaning the tray for a moment on the top of the banisters she
listened Even in that nice warm drawingroom and with a good
fire how cold the lodger must feel sitting studying at the table
But unwonted sounds were coming through the door Mr Sleuth was
moving restlessly about the room not sitting reading as was his
wont at this time of the evening

She knocked and then waited a moment

There came the sound of a sharp click that of the key turning in
the lock of the chiffonnier cupboardor so Mr Sleuths landlady
could have sworn

There was a pauseshe knocked again

Come in said Mr Sleuth loudly and she opened the door and
carried in the tray

You are a little earlier than usual are you not Mrs Bunting
he said with a touch of irritation in his voice

I dont think so sir but Ive been out Perhaps I lost count of
the time I thought youd like your breakfast early as you had
dinner rather sooner than usual

Breakfast Did you say breakfast Mrs Bunting

I beg your pardon sir Im sure I meant supper He looked at
her fixedly It seemed to Mrs Bunting that there was a terrible
questioning look in his dark sunken eyes

Arent you well he said slowly You dont look well Mrs
Bunting

No sir she said Im not well I went over to see a doctor
this afternoon to Ealing sir

I hope he did you good Mrs Buntingthe lodgers voice had
become softer kinder in quality

It always does me good to see the doctor said Mrs Bunting
evasively

And then a very odd smile lit up Mr Sleuths face Doctors are a
maligned body of men he said Im glad to hear you speak well of
them They do their best Mrs Bunting Being human they are liable
to err but I assure you they do their best

That Im sure they do sirshe spoke heartily sincerely
Doctors had always treated her most kindly and even generously

And then having laid the cloth and put the lodgers one hot dish
upon it she went towards the door Wouldnt you like me to bring
up another scuttleful of coals sir its bitterly coldgetting
colder every minute A fearful night to have to go out in she
looked at him deprecatingly

And then Mr Sleuth did something which startled her very much
Pushing his chair back he jumped up and drew himself to his full
height

What dyou mean he stammered Why did you say that Mrs
Bunting

She stared at him fascinated affrighted Again there came an
awful questioning look over his face

I was thinking of Bunting sir Hes got a job tonight Hes
going to act as waiter at a young ladys birthday party I was
thinking its a pity he has to turn out and in his thin clothes
tooshe brought out her words jerkily

Mr Sleuth seemed somewhat reassured and again he sat down Ah
he said Dear meIm sorry to hear that I hope your husband
will not catch cold Mrs Bunting

And then she shut the door and went downstairs



Without telling Bunting what she meant to do she dragged the heavy
washhandstand away from the chimneypiece and lighted the fire

Then in some triumph she called Bunting in

Time for you to dress she cried out cheerfully and Ive got a
little bit of fire for you to dress by

As he exclaimed at her extravagance Well twill be pleasant for
me too keep me companylike while youre out and make the room
nice and warm when you come in Youll be fair perished even
walking that short way she said

And then while her husband was dressing Mrs Bunting went upstairs
and cleared away Mr Sleuths supper

The lodger said no word while she was so engagedno word at all

He was sitting away from the table rather an unusual thing for him
to do and staring into the fire his hands on his knees

Mr Sleuth looked lonely very very lonely and forlorn Somehow a
great rush of pity as well as of horror came over Mrs Buntings
heart He was such aashe searched for a word in her mind but
could only find the word gentlehe was such a nice gentle
gentleman was Mr Sleuth Lately he had again taken to leaving his
money about as he had done the first day or two and with some
concern his landlady had seen that the store had diminished a good
deal A very simple calculation had made her realise that almost the
whole of that missing money had come her way or at any rate had
passed through her hands

Mr Sleuth never stinted himself as to food or stinted them his
landlord and his landlady as to what he had said he would pay
And Mrs Buntings conscience pricked her a little for he hardly
ever used that room upstairsthat room for which he had paid extra
so generously If Bunting got another job or two through that nasty
man in Baker Streetand now that the ice had been broken between
them it was very probable that he would do so for he was a very
welltrained experienced waiterthen she thought she would tell
Mr Sleuth that she no longer wanted him to pay as much as he was
now doing

She looked anxiously deprecatingly at his long bent back

Goodnight sir she said at last

Mr Sleuth turned round His face looked sad and worn

I hope youll sleep well sir

Yes Im sure I shall sleep well But perhaps I shall take a
little turn first Such is my way Mrs Bunting after I have been
studying all day I require a little exercise

Oh I wouldnt go out tonight she said deprecatingly Tisnt
fit for anyone to be out in the bitter cold

And yetand yethe looked at her attentivelythere will
probably be many people out in the streets tonight

A many more than usual I fear sir

Indeed said Mr Sleuth quickly Is it not a strange thing
Mrs Bunting that people who have all day in which to amuse
themselves should carry their revels far into the night

Oh I wasnt thinking of revellers sir I was thinkingshe
hesitated then with a gasping effort Mrs Bunting brought out the
words of the police

The police He put up his right hand and stroked his chin two or
three times with a nervous gesture But what is manwhat is mans
puny power or strength against that of God or even of those over
whose feet God has set a guard

Mr Sleuth looked at his landlady with a kind of triumph lighting up
his face and Mrs Bunting felt a shuddering sense of relief Then
she had not offended her lodger She had not made him angry by that
thatwas it a hint she had meant to convey to him

Very true sir she said respectfully But Providence means us
to take care o ourselves too And then she closed the door behind
her and went downstairs

But Mr Sleuths landlady did not go on down to the kitchen She
came into her sittingroom and careless of what Bunting would think
the next morning put the tray with the remains of the lodgers meal on
her table Having done that and having turned out the gas in the
passage and the sittingroom she went into her bedroom and closed the
door

The fire was burning brightly and clearly She told herself that
she did not need any other light to undress by

What was it made the flames of the fire shoot up shoot down in
that queer way But watching it for awhile she did at last doze
off a bit

And thenand then Mrs Bunting woke with a sudden thumping of her
heart Woke to see that the fire was almost outwoke to hear a
quarter to twelve chime outwoke at last to the sound she had been
listening for before she fell asleepthe sound of Mr Sleuth
wearing his rubbersoled shoes creeping downstairs along the
passage and so out very very quietly by the front door

But once she was in bed Mrs Bunting turned restless She tossed
this way and that full of discomfort and unease Perhaps it was
the unaccustomed firelight dancing on the walls making queer shadows
all round her which kept her so wide awake

She lay thinking and listeninglistening and thinking It even
occurred to her to do the one thing that might have quieted her
excited brainto get a book one of those detective stories of
which Bunting had a slender store in the next room and then
lighting the gas to sit up and read

No Mrs Bunting had always been told it was very wrong to read in
bed and she was not in a mood just now to begin doing anything that
she had been told was wrong   



CHAPTER XXI

It was a very cold nightso cold so windy so snowladen was the
atmosphere that everyone who could do so stayed indoors

Bunting however was now on his way home from what had proved a
really pleasant job A remarkable piece of luck had come his way
this evening all the more welcome because it was quite unexpected
The young lady at whose birthday party he had been present in
capacity of waiter had come into a fortune that day and she had had
the gracious the surprising thought of presenting each of the hired
waiters with a sovereign

This gift which had been accompanied by a few kind words had gone
to Buntings heart It had confirmed him in his Conservative
principles only gentlefolk ever behaved in that way quiet
oldfashioned respectable gentlefolk the sort of people of whom
those nasty Radicals know nothing and care less

But the exbutler was not as happy as he should have been
Slackening his footsteps he began to think with puzzled concern of
how queer his wife had seemed lately Ellen had become so nervous
so jumpy that he didnt know what to make of her sometimes She
had never been really goodtemperedyour capable selfrespecting
woman seldom isbut she had never been like what she was now And
she didnt get better as the days went on in fact she got worse
Of late she had been quite hysterical and for no reason at all
Take that little practical joke of young Joe Chandler Ellen knew
quite well he often had to go about in some kind of disguise and yet
how she had gone on quite foolishlikenot at all as one would
have expected her to do

There was another queer thing about her which disturbed him in more
senses than one During the last three weeks or so Ellen had taken
to talking in her sleep No no no she had cried out only the
night before It isnt trueI wont have it saidits a lie
And there had been a wail of horrible fear and revolt in her usually
quiet mincing voice



Whew it was cold and he had stupidly forgotten his gloves

He put his hands in his pockets to keep them warm and began walking
more quickly

As he tramped steadily along the exbutler suddenly caught sight
of his lodger walking along the opposite side of the solitary street
one of those short streets leading off the broad road which
encircles Regents Park

Well This was a funny time o night to be taking a stroll for
pleasure like

Glancing across Bunting noticed that Mr Sleuths tall thin figure
was rather bowed and that his head was bent toward the ground His
left arm was thrust into his long Inverness cape and so was quite
hidden but the other side of the cape bulged out as if the lodger
were carrying a bag or parcel in the hand which hung down straight

Mr Sleuth was walking rather quickly and as he walked he talked
aloud which as Bunting knew is not unusual with gentlemen who live
much alone It was clear that he had not yet become aware of the
proximity of his landlord

Bunting told himself that Ellen was right Their lodger was
certainly a most eccentric peculiar person Strange was it not
that that odd lunylike gentleman should have made all the
difference to his Buntings and Mrs Buntings happiness and
comfort in life

Again glancing across at Mr Sleuth he reminded himself not for
the first time of this perfect lodgers one faulthis odd dislike
to meat and to what Bunting vaguely called to himself sensible food

But there you cant have everything The more so that the lodger
was not one of those crazy vegetarians who wont eat eggs and cheese
No he was reasonable in this as in everything else connected with
his dealings with the Buntings

As we know Bunting saw far less of the lodger than did his wife
Indeed he had been upstairs only three or four times since Mr
Sleuth had been with them and when his landlord had had occasion
to wait on him the lodger had remained silent Indeed their
gentleman had made it very clear that he did not like either the
husband or wife to come up to his rooms without being definitely
asked to do so

Now surely would be a good opportunity for a little genial
conversation Bunting felt pleased to see his lodger it increased
his general comfortable sense of satisfaction

So it was that the butler still an active man for his years
crossed over the road and stepping briskly forward began trying
to overtake Mr Sleuth But the more he hurried along the more the
other hastened and that without ever turning round to see whose
steps he could hear echoing behind him on the now freezing pavement

Mr Sleuths own footsteps were quite inaudiblean odd circumstance
when you came to think of itas Bunting did think of it later
lying awake by Mrs Buntings side in the pitch darkness What it
meant of course was that the lodger had rubber soles on his shoes
Now Bunting had never had a pair of rubbersoled shoes sent down to
him to clean He had always supposed the lodger had only one pair of
outdoor boots

The two menthe pursued and the pursuerat last turned into the
Marylebone Road they were now within a few hundred yards of home
Plucking up courage Bunting called out his voice echoing freshly
on the still air

Mr Sleuth sir Mr Sleuth

The lodger stopped and turned round

He had been walking so quickly and he was in so poor a physical
condition that the sweat was pouring down his face

Ah So its you Mr Bunting I heard footsteps behind me and
I hurried on I wish Id known that it was you there are so many
queer characters about at night in London

Not on a night like this sir Only honest folk who have business
out of doors would be out such a night as this It is cold sir

And then into Buntings slow and honest mind there suddenly crept
the query as to what on earth Mr Sleuths own business out could be
on this bitter night

Cold the lodger repeated he was panting a little and his words
came out sharp and quick through his thin lips I cant say that
I find it cold Mr Bunting When the snow falls the air always
becomes milder

Yes sir but tonight theres such a sharp east wind Why it
freezes the very marrow in ones bones Still theres nothing like
walking in cold weather to make one warm as you seem to have found
sir

Bunting noticed that Mr Sleuth kept his distance in a rather strange
way he walked at the edge of the pavement leaving the rest of it
on the wall side to his landlord

I lost my way he said abruptly Ive been over Primrose Hill to
see a friend of mine a man with whom I studied when I was a lad
and then coming back I lost my way

Now they had come right up to the little gate which opened on the
shabby paved court in front of the housethat gate which now was
never locked

Mr Sleuth pushing suddenly forward began walking up the flagged
path when with a By your leave sir the exbutler stepping
aside slipped in front of his lodger in order to open the front
door for him

As he passed by Mr Sleuth the back of Buntings bare left hand
brushed lightly against the long Inverness cape the lodger was
wearing and to Buntings surprise the stretch of cloth against
which his hand lay for a moment was not only damp damp maybe from
stray flakes of snow which had settled upon it but wetwet and
gluey

Bunting thrust his left hand into his pocket it was with the other
that he placed the key in the lock of the door

The two men passed into the hall together

The house seemed blackly dark in comparison with the lightedup
road outside and as he groped forward closely followed by the
lodger there came over Bunting a sudden reeling sensation of
mortal terror an instinctive assailing knowledge of frightful
immediate danger

A stuffless voicethe voice of his first wife the longdead
girl to whom his mind so seldom reverted nowadaysuttered into
his ear the words Take care

And then the lodger spoke His voice was harsh and grating
though not loud

Im afraid Mr Bunting that you must have felt something dirty
foul on my coat Its too long a story to tell you now but I
brushed up against a dead animal a creature to whose misery some
thoughtful soul had put an end lying across a bench on Primrose
Hill

No sir no I didnt notice nothing I scarcely touched you
sir

It seemed as if a power outside himself compelled Bunting to utter
these lying words And now sir Ill be saying goodnight to you
he said

Stepping back he pressed with all the strength that was in him
against the wall and let the other pass him There was a pause
and thenGoodnight returned Mr Sleuth in a hollow voice
Bunting waited until the lodger had gone upstairs and then
lighting the gas he sat down there in the hall Mr Sleuths
landlord felt very queerqueer and sick

He did not draw his left hand out of his pocket till he heard Mr
Sleuth shut the bedroom door upstairs Then he held up his left
hand and looked at it curiously it was flecked streaked with
pale reddish blood

Taking off his boots he crept into the room where his wife lay
asleep Stealthily he walked across to the washhandstand and
dipped a hand into the waterjug

Whatever are you doing What on earth are you doing came a
voice from the bed and Bunting started guiltily

Im just washing my hands

Indeed youre doing nothing of the sort I never heard of such
a thingputting your hand into the water in which I was going to
wash my face tomorrow morning

Im very sorry Ellen he said meekly I meant to throw it away
You dont suppose I would have let you wash in dirty water do you

She said no more but as he began undressing himself Mrs Bunting
lay staring at him in a way that made her husband feel even more
uncomfortable than he was already

At last he got into bed He wanted to break the oppressive silence
by telling Ellen about the sovereign the young lady had given him
but that sovereign now seemed to Bunting of no more account than if
it had been a farthing he had picked up in the road outside

Once more his wife spoke and he gave so great a start that it shook
the bed

I suppose that you dont know that youve left the light burning in
the hall wasting our good money she observed tartly

He got up painfully and opened the door into the passage It was as
she had said the gas was flaring away wasting their good moneyor
rather Mr Sleuths good money Since he had come to be their lodger
they had not had to touch their rent money

Bunting turned out the light and groped his way back to the room and
so to bed Without speaking again to each other both husband and
wife lay awake till dawn

The next morning Mr Sleuths landlord awoke with a start he felt
curiously heavy about the limbs and tired about the eyes

Drawing his watch from under his pillow he saw that it was seven
oclock Without waking his wife he got out of bed and pulled the
blind a little to one side It was snowing heavily and as is the
way when it snows even in London everything was strangely
curiously still After he had dressed he went out into the passage
As he had at once dreaded and hoped their newspaper was already
lying on the mat It was probably the sound of its being pushed
through the letterbox which had waked him from his unrestful
sleep

He picked the paper up and went into the sittingroom then
shutting the door behind him carefully he spread the newspaper
wide open on the table and bent over it

As Bunting at last looked up and straightened himself an expression
of intense relief shone upon his stolid face The item of news he
had felt certain would be printed in big type on the middle sheet
was not there



CHAPTER XXII

Feeling amazingly lighthearted almost lightheaded Bunting lit
the gasring to make his wife her morning cup of tea

While he was doing it he suddenly heard her call out

Bunting she cried weakly Bunting Quickly he hurried in
response to her call Yes he said What is it my dear I
wont be a minute with your tea And he smiled broadly rather
foolishly

She sat up and looked at him a dazed expression on her face

What are you grinning at she asked suspiciously

Ive had a wonderful piece of luck he explained But you was
so cross last night that I simply didnt dare tell you about it

Well tell me now she said in a low voice

I had a sovereign given me by the young lady You see it was her
birthday party Ellen and shed come into a nice bit of money and
she gave each of us waiters a sovereign

Mrs Bunting made no comment Instead she lay back and closed her
eyes

What time dyou expect Daisy she asked languidly You didnt
say what time Joe was going to fetch her when we was talking about
it yesterday

Didnt I Well I expect theyll be in to dinner

I wonder how long that old aunt of hers expects us to keep her
said Mrs Bunting thoughtfully All the cheer died out of Buntings
round face He became sullen and angry It would be a pretty thing
if he couldnt have his own daughter for a bitespecially now that
they were doing so well

Daisyll stay here just as long as she can he said shortly
Its too bad of you Ellen to talk like that She helps you all
she can and she brisks us both up ever so much Besides twould
be cruelcruel to take the girl away just now just as she and
that young chap are making friendslike One would suppose that
even you would see the justice o that

But Mrs Bunting made no answer

Bunting went off back into the sittingroom The water was boiling
now so he made the tea and then as he brought the little tray in
his heart softened Ellen did look really illill and wizened
He wondered if she had a pain about which she wasnt saying anything
She had never been one to grouse about herself

The lodger and me came in together last night he observed
genially Hes certainly a funny kind of gentleman It wasnt
the sort of night one would have chosen to go out for a walk now
was it And yet he must a been out a long time if what he said
was true

I dont wonder a quiet gentleman like Mr Sleuth hates the
crowded streets she said slowly They gets worse every day
that they do But go along now I want to get up

He went back into their sittingroom and having laid the fire
and put a match to it he sat down comfortably with his newspaper

Deep down in his heart Bunting looked back to this last night with
a feeling of shame and selfrebuke Whatever had made such horrible
thoughts and suspicions as had possessed him suddenly come into his
head And just because of a trifling thing like that blood No
doubt Mr Sleuths nose had bledthat was what had happened
though come to think of it he had mentioned brushing up against
a dead animal

Perhaps Ellen was right after all It didnt do for one to be
always thinking of dreadful subjects of murders and suchlike It
made one go dottythats what it did

And just as he was telling himself that there came to the door a
loud knock the peculiar rattattat of a telegraph boy But before
he had time to get across the room let alone to the front door
Ellen had rushed through the room clad only in a petticoat and
shawl

Ill go she cried breathlessly Ill go Bunting dont you
trouble

He stared at her surprised and followed her into the hall

She put out a hand and hiding herself behind the door took the
telegram from the invisible boy You neednt wait she said
If theres an answer well send it out ourselves Then she tore
the envelope openOh she said with a gasp of relief Its
only from Joe Chandler to say he cant go over to fetch Daisy this
morning Then youll have to go

She walked back into their sittingroom There she said
There it is Bunting You just read it

Am on duty this morning Cannot fetch Miss Daisy as arranged
Chandler

I wonder why hes on duty said Bunting slowly uncomfortably
I thought Joes hours was as regular as clockworkthat nothing
could make any difference to them However there it is I suppose
itll do all right if I start about eleven oclock It may have
left off snowing by then I dont feel like going out again just
now Im pretty tired this morning

You start about twelve said his wife quickly

Thatll give plenty of time

The morning went on quietly uneventfully Bunting received a
letter from Old Aunt saying Daisy must come back next Monday a
little under a week from now Mr Sleuth slept soundly or at
any rate he made no sign of being awake and though Mrs Bunting
often stopped to listen while she was doing her room there
came no sounds at all from overhead

Scarcely aware that it was so both Bunting and his wife felt more
cheerful than they had done for a long time They had quite a
pleasant little chat when Mrs Bunting came and sat down for a bit
before going down to prepare Mr Sleuths breakfast

Daisy will be surprised to see younot to say disappointed she
observed and she could not help laughing a little to herself at
the thought And when at eleven Bunting got up to go she made
him stay on a little longer Theres no such great hurry as that
she said goodtemperedly Itll do quite well if youre there by
halfpast twelve Ill get dinner ready myself Daisy neednt help
with that I expect Margaret has worked her pretty hard

But at last there came the moment when Bunting had to start and
his wife went with him to the front door It was still snowing
less heavily but still snowing There were very few people coming
and going and only just a few cabs and carts dragging cautiously
along through the slush

Mrs Bunting was still in the kitchen when there came a ring and a
knock at the doora now very familiar ring and knock Joe thinks
Daisys home again by now she said smiling to herself

Before the door was well open she heard Chandlers voice Dont
be scared this time Mrs Bunting But though not exactly scared
she did give a gasp of surprise For there stood Joe made up to
represent a publichouse loafer and he looked the part to perfection
with his hair combed down raggedly over his forehead his
seedylooking illfitting dirty clothes and greenishblack pot hat

I havent a minute he said a little breathlessly But I thought
Id just run in to know if Miss Daisy was safe home again You got
my telegram all right I couldnt send no other kind of message

Shes not back yet Her father hasnt been gone long after her
Then struck by a look in his eyes Joe whats the matter she
asked quickly

There came a thrill of suspense in her voice her face grew drawn
while what little colour there was in it receded leaving it very
pale

Well he said Well Mrs Bunting Ive no business to say
anything about itbut I will tell you

He walked in and shut the door of the sittingroom carefully behind
him Theres been another of em he whispered But this time
no one is to know anything about itnot for the present I mean
he corrected himself hastily The Yard thinks weve got a clue
and a good clue too this time

But whereand how faltered Mrs Bunting

Well twas just a bit of luck being able to keep it dark for the
presenthe still spoke in that stifled hoarse whisper The
poor soul was found dead on a bench on Primrose Hill And just by
chance twas one of our fellows saw the body first He was on his
way home over Hampstead way He knew where hed be able to get an
ambulance quick and he made a very clever secret job of it I
spect hell get promotion for that

What about the clue asked Mrs Bunting with dry lips You said
there was a clue

Well I dont rightly understand about the clue myself All I
knows is its got something to do with a publichouse The Hammer
and Tongs which isnt far off there They feels sure The Avenger
was in the bar just on closingtime

And then Mrs Bunting sat down She felt better now It was natural
the police should suspect a publichouse loafer Then thats why you
wasnt able to go and fetch Daisy I suppose

He nodded Mums the word Mrs Bunting Itll all be in the last
editions of the evening newspapersit cant be kep out Thered be
too much of a row if twas

Are you going off to that publichouse now she asked

Yes I am Ive got a awkard jobto try and worm something out
of the barmaid

Something out of the barmaid repeated Mrs Bunting nervously
Why whatever for

He came and stood close to her They think twas a gentleman he
whispered

A gentleman

Mrs Bunting stared at Chandler with a scared expression Whatever
makes them think such a silly thing as that

Well just before closingtime a very peculiarlooking gent with a
leather bag in his hand went into the bar and asked for a glass of
milk And what dyou think he did Paid for it with a sovereign
He wouldnt take no changejust made the girl a present of it
Thats why the young woman what served him seems quite unwilling to
give him away She wont tell now what he was like She doesnt
know what hes wanted for and we dont want her to know just yet
Thats one reason why nothings being said public about it But
there I really must be going now My timell be up at three
oclock I thought of coming in on the way back and asking you for
a cup o tea Mrs Bunting

Do she said Do Joe Youll be welcome but there was no
welcome in her tired voice

She let him go alone to the door and then she went down to her
kitchen and began cooking Mr Sleuths breakfast

The lodger would be sure to ring soon and then any minute Bunting
and Daisy might be home and theyd want something too Margaret
always had breakfast even when the family were away unnaturally
early

As she bustled about Mrs Bunting tried to empty her mind of all
thought But it is very difficult to do that when one is in a state
of torturing uncertainty She had not dared to ask Chandler what
they supposed that man who had gone into the publichouse was really
like It was fortunate indeed that the lodger and that inquisitive
young chap had never met face to face

At last Mr Sleuths bell ranga quiet little tinkle But when
she went up with his breakfast the lodger was not in his sittingroom

Supposing him to be still in his bedroom Mrs Bunting put the cloth
on the table and then she heard the sound of his footsteps coming
down the stairs and her quick ears detected the slight whirring
sound which showed that the gasstove was alight Mr Sleuth had
already lit the stove that meant that he would carry out some
elaborate experiment this afternoon

Still snowing he said doubtfully How very very quiet and
still London is when under snow Mrs Bunting I have never known
it quite as quiet as this morning Not a sound outside or in A
very pleasant change from the shouting which sometimes goes on in
the Marylebone Road

Yes she said dully Its awful quiet todaytoo quiet to my
thinking Taint naturallike

The outside gate swung to making a noisy clatter in the still air

Is that someone coming in here asked Mr Sleuth drawing a quick
hissing breath Perhaps you will oblige me by going to the window
and telling me who it is Mrs Bunting

And his landlady obeyed him

Its only Bunting sirBunting and his daughter

Oh Is that all

Mr Sleuth hurried after her and she shrank back a little She
had never been quite so near to the lodger before save on that
first day when she had been showing him her rooms

Side by side they stood looking out of the window And as if
aware that someone was standing there Daisy turned her bright face
up towards the window and smiled at her stepmother and at the
lodger whose face she could only dimly discern

A very sweetlooking young girl said Mr Sleuth thoughtfully
And then he quoted a little bit of poetry and this took Mrs
Bunting very much aback

Wordsworth he murmured dreamily A poet too little read
nowadays Mrs Bunting but one with a beautiful feeling for nature
for youth for innocence

Indeed sir Mrs Bunting stepped back a little Your breakfast
will be getting cold sir if you dont have it now

He went back to the table obediently and sat down as a child
rebuked might have done

And then his landlady left him

Well said Bunting cheerily Everything went off quite all right
And Daisys a lucky girlthat she is Her Aunt Margaret gave her
five shillings

But Daisy did not look as pleased as her father thought she ought
to do

I hope nothings happened to Mr Chandler she said a little
disconsolately The very last words he said to me last night was
that hed be there at ten oclock I got quite fidgety as the time
went on and he didnt come

Hes been here said Mrs Bunting slowly

Been here cried her husband Then why on earth didnt he go and
fetch Daisy if hed time to come here

He was on the way to his job his wife answered You run along
child downstairs Now that you are here you can make yourself
useful

And Daisy reluctantly obeyed She wondered what it was her
stepmother didnt want her to hear

Ive something to tell you Bunting

Yes He looked across uneasily Yes Ellen

Theres been another o those murders But the police dont want
anyone to know about itnot yet Thats why Joe couldnt go over
and fetch Daisy Theyre all on duty again

Bunting put out his hand and clutched hold of the edge of the
mantelpiece He had gone very red but his wife was far too much
concerned with her own feelings and sensations to notice it

There was a long silence between them Then he spoke making a
great effort to appear unconcerned

And where did it happen he asked Close to the other one

She hesitated then I dont know He didnt say But hush
she added quickly Heres Daisy Dont lets talk of that horror
in front of herlike Besides I promised Chandler Id be mum

And he acquiesced

You can be laying the cloth child while I go up and clear away
the lodgers breakfast Without waiting for an answer she hurried
upstairs

Mr Sleuth had left the greater part of the nice lemon sole untouched
I dont feel well today he said fretfully And Mrs Bunting
I should be much obliged if your husband would lend me that paper I
saw in his hand I do not often care to look at the public prints
but I should like to do so now

She flew downstairs Bunting she said a little breathlessly
the lodger would like you just to lend him the Sun

Bunting handed it over to her Ive read it through he observed
You can tell him that I dont want it back again

On her way up she glanced down at the pink sheet Occupying a third
of the space was an irregular drawing and under it was written in
rather large characters

We are glad to be able to present our readers with an authentic
reproduction of the footprint of the halfworn rubber sole which
was almost certainly worn by The Avenger when he committed his
double murder ten days ago

She went into the sittingroom To her relief it was empty

Kindly put the paper down on the table came Mr Sleuths muffled
voice from the upper landing

She did so Yes sir And Bunting dont want the paper back
again sir He says hes read it And then she hurried out of
the room



CHAPTER XXIII

All afternoon it went on snowing and the three of them sat there
listening and waitingBunting and his wife hardly knew for what
Daisy for the knock which would herald Joe Chandler

And about four there came the now familiar sound

Mrs Bunting hurried out into the passage and as she opened the
front door she whispered We havent said anything to Daisy yet
Young girls cant keep secrets

Chandler nodded comprehendingly He now looked the low character
he had assumed to the life for he was blue with cold disheartened
and tired out

Daisy gave a little cry of shocked surprise of amusement of
welcome when she saw how cleverly he was disguised

I never she exclaimed What a difference it do make to be
sure Why you looks quite horrid Mr Chandler

And somehow that little speech of hers amused her father so much
that he quite cheered up Bunting had been very dull and quiet
all that afternoon

It wont take me ten minutes to make myself respectable again
said the young man rather ruefully

His host and hostess looking at him eagerly furtively both came
to the conclusion that he had been unsuccessfulthat he had failed
that is in getting any information worth having And though in a
sense they all had a pleasant tea together there was an air of
constraint even of discomfort over the little party

Bunting felt it hard that he couldnt ask the questions that were
trembling on his lips he would have felt it hard any time during
the last month to refrain from knowing anything Joe could tell him
but now it seemed almost intolerable to be in this queer kind of
half suspense There was one important fact he longed to know
and at last came his opportunity of doing so for Joe Chandler rose
to leave and this time it was Bunting who followed him out into
the hall

Where did it happen he whispered Just tell me that Joe

Primrose Hill said the other briefly Youll know all about it
in a minute or two for itll be all in the last editions of the
evening papers Thats whats been arranged

No arrest I suppose

Chandler shook his head despondently No he said Im inclined
to think the Yard was on a wrong tack altogether this time But one
can only do ones best I dont know if Mrs Bunting told you Id
got to question a barmaid about a man who was in her place just
before closingtime Well shes said all she knew and its as
clear as daylight to me that the eccentric old gent she talks about
was only a harmless luny He gave her a sovereign just because she
told him she was a teetotaller He laughed ruefully

Even Bunting was diverted at the notion Well thats a queer
thing for a barmaid to be he exclaimed Shes niece to the people
what keeps the public explained Chandler and then he went out of
the front door with a cheerful So long

When Bunting went back into the sittingroom Daisy had disappeared
She had gone downstairs with the tray Wheres my girl he said
irritably

Shes just taken the tray downstairs

He went out to the top of the kitchen stairs and called out sharply
Daisy Daisy child Are you down there

Yes father came her eager happy voice

Better come up out of that cold kitchen

He turned and came back to his wife Ellen is the lodger in I
havent heard him moving about Now mind what I says please I
dont want Daisy to be mixed up with him

Mr Sleuth dont seem very well today answered Mrs Bunting
quietly Taint likely I should let Daisy have anything to do
with him Why shes never even seen him Taint likely I should
allow her to begin waiting on him now

But though she was surprised and a little irritated by the tone in
which Bunting had spoken no glimmer of the truth illumined her mind
So accustomed had she become to bearing alone the burden of her awful
secret that it would have required far more than a cross word or
two far more than the fact that Bunting looked ill and tired for
her to have come to suspect that her secret was now shared by another
and that other her husband

Again and again the poor soul had agonised and trembled at the
thought of her house being invaded by the police but that was only
because she had always credited the police with supernatural powers
of detection That they should come to know the awful fact she kept
hidden in her breast would have seemed to her on the whole a
natural thing but that Bunting should even dimly suspect it appeared
beyond the range of possibility

And yet even Daisy noticed a change in her father He sat cowering
over the firesaying nothing doing nothing

Why father aint you well the girl asked more than once

And looking up he would answer Yes Im well enough my girl
but I feels cold Its awful cold I never did feel anything like
the cold weve got just now

   

At eight the now familiar shouts and cries began again outside

The Avenger again Another horrible crime Extra speshul
editionsuch were the shouts the exultant yells hurled through
the clear cold air They fell like bombs into the quiet room

Both Bunting and his wife remained silent but Daisys cheeks grew
pink with excitement and her eye sparkled

Hark father Hark Ellen Dyou hear that she exclaimed
childishly and even clapped her hands I do wish Mr Chandler
had been here He would a been startled

Dont Daisy and Bunting frowned

Then getting up he stretched himself Its fair getting on my
mind he said these horrible things happening Id like to get
right away from London just as far as I couldthat I would

Up to JohnoGroats said Daisy laughing And then Why
father aint you going out to get a paper

Yes I suppose I must

Slowly he went out of the room and lingering a moment in the hall
he put on his greatcoat and hat Then he opened the front door
and walked down the flagged path Opening the iron gate he stepped
out on the pavement then crossed the road to where the newspaperboys
now stood

The boy nearest to him only had the Suna late edition of the paper
he had already read It annoyed Bunting to give a penny for a
hapenny rag of which he already knew the main contents But there
was nothing else to do

Standing under a lamppost he opened out the newspaper It was
bitingly cold that perhaps was why his hand shook as he looked
down at the big headlines For Bunting had been very unfair to the
enterprise of the editor of his favourite evening paper This
special edition was full of new matternew matter concerning
The Avenger

First in huge type right across the page was the brief statement
that The Avenger had now committed his ninth crime and that he had
chosen quite a new locality namely the lonely stretch of rising
ground known to Londoners as Primrose Hill

The police so Bunting read are very reserved as to the
circumstances which led to the finding of the body of The Avengers
latest victim But we have reason to believe that they possess
several really important clues and that one of them is concerned
with the halfworn rubber sole of which we are the first to reproduce
an outline today See over page

And Bunting turning the sheet round about saw the irregular outline
he had already seen in the early edition of the Sun that purporting
to be a facsimile of the imprint left by The Avengers rubber sole

He stared down at the rough outline which took up so much of the
space which should have been devoted to reading matter with a queer
sinking feeling of terrified alarm Again and again criminals had
been tracked by the marks their boots or shoes had made at or near
the scenes of their misdoings

Practically the only job Bunting did in his own house of a menial
kind was the cleaning of the boots and shoes He had already
visualised early this very afternoon the little row with which he
dealt each morningfirst came his wifes strong serviceable
boots then his own two pairs a good deal patched and mended and
next to his own Mr Sleuths strong hardly worn and expensive
buttoned boots Of late a dear little coquettish highheeled pair
of outdoor shoes with thin paperlike soles bought by Daisy for
her trip to London had ended the row The girl had worn these
thin shoes persistently in defiance of Ellens reproof and advice
and he Bunting had only once had to clean her more sensible
country pair and that only because the others had become wet though
the day he and she had accompanied young Chandler to Scotland Yard

Slowly he returned across the road Somehow the thought of going
in again of hearing his wifes sarcastic comments of parrying
Daisys eager questions had become intolerable So he walked
slowly trying to put off the evil moment when he would have to tell
them what was in his paper

The lamp under which he had stood reading was not exactly opposite
the house It was rather to the right of it And when having
crossed over the roadway he walked along the pavement towards his
own gate he heard odd shuffling sounds coming from the inner side
of the low wall which shut off his little courtyard from the pavement

Now under ordinary circumstances Bunting would have rushed forward
to drive out whoever was there He and his wife had often had
trouble before the cold weather began with vagrants seeking shelter
there But tonight he stayed outside listening intently sick
with suspense and fear

Was it possible that their place was being watchedalready He
thought it only too likely Bunting like Mrs Bunting credited
the police with almost supernatural powers especially since he
had paid that visit to Scotland Yard

But to Buntings amazement and yes relief it was his lodger who
suddenly loomed up in the dim light

Mr Sleuth must have been stooping down for his tall lank form
had been quite concealed till he stepped forward from behind the
low wall on to the flagged path leading to the front door

The lodger was carrying a brown paper parcel and as he walked
along the new boots he was wearing creaked and the taptap of
hard nailstudded heels rang out on the flatstones of the narrow
path

Bunting still standing outside the gate suddenly knew what it was
his lodger had been doing on the other side of the low wall Mr
Sleuth had evidently been out to buy himself another pair of new
boots and then he had gone inside the gate and had put them on
placing his old footgear in the paper in which the new pair had
been wrapped

The exbutler waitedwaited quite a long time not only until Mr
Sleuth had let himself into the house but till the lodger had had
time to get well away upstairs

Then he also walked up the flagged pathway and put his latchkey in
the door He lingered as long over the job of hanging his hat and
coat up in the hall as he dared in fact till his wife called out
to him Then he went in and throwing the paper down on the table
he said sullenly There it is You can see it all for yourself
not that theres very much to see and groped his way to the fire

His wife looked at him in sharp alarm Whatever have you done to
yourself she exclaimed Youre illthats what it is Bunting
You got a chill last night

I told you Id got a chill he muttered Twasnt last night
though twas going out this morning coming back in the bus
Margaret keeps that housekeepers room o hers like a hothouse
thats what she does Twas going out from there into the biting
wind thats what did for me It must be awful to stand about in
such weather tis a wonder to me how that young fellow Joe Chandler
can stand the lifebeing out in all weathers like he is

Bunting spoke at random his one anxiety being to get away from what
was in the paper which now lay neglected on the table

Those that keep out o doors all day never do come to no harm
said his wife testily But if you felt so bad whatever was you
out so long for Bunting I thought youd gone away somewhere
Dyou mean you only went to get the paper

I just stopped for a second to look at it under the lamp he
muttered apologetically

That was a silly thing to do

Perhaps it was he admitted meekly

Daisy had taken up the paper Well they dont say much she
said disappointedly Hardly anything at all But perhaps Mr
Chandler ll be in soon again If so hell tell us more about it

A young girl like you oughtnt to want to know anything about
murders said her stepmother severely Joe wont think any the
better of you for your inquisitiveness about such things If I
was you Daisy I shouldnt say nothing about it if he does come in
which I fair tell you I hope he wont Ive seen enough of that
young chap today

He didnt come in for longnot today said Daisy her lip
trembling

I can tell you one thing thatll surprise you my dearMrs
Bunting looked significantly at her stepdaughter She also wanted
to get away from that dread newswhich yet was no news

Yes said Daisy rather defiantly What is it Ellen

Maybe youll be surprised to hear that Joe did come in this morning
He knew all about that affair then but he particular asked that
you shouldnt be told anything about it

Never cried Daisy much mortified

Yes went on her stepmother ruthlessly You just ask your father
over there if it isnt true

Taint a healthy thing to speak overmuch about such happenings
said Bunting heavily

If I was Joe went on Mrs Bunting quickly pursuing her advantage
I shouldnt want to talk about such horrid things when I comes in
to have a quiet chat with friends But the minute he comes in that
poor young chap is set uponmostly I admit by your father she
looked at her husband severely But you does your share too
Daisy You asks him this you asks him thathes fair puzzled
sometimes It dont do to be so inquisitive



And perhaps because of this little sermon on Mrs Buntings part
when young Chandler did come in again that evening very little was
said of the new Avenger murder

Bunting made no reference to it at all and though Daisy said a
word it was but a word And Joe Chandler thought he had never
spent a pleasanter evening in his lifefor it was he and Daisy
who talked all the time their elders remaining for the most part
silent

Daisy told of all that she had done with Aunt Margaret She
described the long dull hours and the queer jobs her aunt set her
to dothe washing up of all the fine drawingroom china in a big
basin lined with flannel and how terrified she Daisy had been
lest there should come even one teeny little chip to any of it
Then she went on to relate some of the funny things Aunt Margaret
had told her about the family

There came a really comic tale which hugely interested and delighted
Chandler This was of how Aunt Margarets lady had been taken in by
an impostoran impostor who had come up just as she was stepping
out of her carriage and pretended to have a fit on the doorstep
Aunt Margarets lady being a soft one had insisted on the man
coming into the hall where he had been given all kinds of
restoratives When the man had at last gone off it was found that
he had wolfed young masters best walkingstick one with a fine
tortoiseshell top to it Thus had Aunt Margaret proved to her lady
that the man had been shamming and her lady had been very angry
near had a fit herself

Theres a lot of that about said Chandler laughing
Incorrigible rogues and vagabondsthats what those sort of people
are

And then he in his turn told an elaborate tale of an exceptionally
clever swindler whom he himself had brought to book He was very
proud of that job it had formed a white stone in his career as a
detective And even Mrs Bunting was quite interested to hear about
it

Chandler was still sitting there when Mr Sleuths bell rang For
awhile no one stirred then Bunting looked questioningly at his wife

Did you hear that he said I think Ellen that was the lodgers
bell

She got up without alacrity and went upstairs

I rang said Mr Sleuth weakly to tell you I dont require any
supper tonight Mrs Bunting Only a glass of milk with a lump
of sugar in it That is all I requirenothing more I feel very
very far from welland he had a hunted plaintive expression on
his face And then I thought your husband would like his paper
back again Mrs Bunting

Mrs Bunting looking at him fixedly with a sad intensity of gaze
of which she was quite unconscious answered Oh no sir
Bunting dont require that paper now He read it all through
Something impelled her to add ruthlessly Hes got another paper
by now sir You may have heard them come shouting outside Would
you like me to bring you up that other paper sir

And Mr Sleuth shook his head No he said querulously I much
regret now having asked for the one paper I did read for it
disturbed me Mrs Bunting There was nothing of any value in it
there never is in any public print I gave up reading newspapers
years ago and I much regret that I broke though my rule today

As if to indicate to her that he did not wish for any more
conversation the lodger then did what he had never done before in
his landladys presence He went over to the fireplace and
deliberately turned his back on her

She went down and brought up the glass of milk and the lump of
sugar he had asked for

Now he was in his usual place sitting at the table studying the
Book

When Mrs Bunting went back to the others they were chatting
merrily She did not notice that the merriment was confined to the
two young people

Well said Daisy pertly How about the lodger Ellen Is he
all right

Yes she said stiffly Of course he is

He must feel pretty dull sitting up there all by himselfawful
lonelylike I call it said the girl

But her stepmother remained silent

Whatever does he do with himself all day persisted Daisy

Just now hes reading the Bible Mrs Bunting answered shortly
and dryly

Well I never Thats a funny thing for a gentleman to do

And Joe alone of her three listeners laugheda long hearty peal
of amusement

Theres nothing to laugh at said Mrs Bunting sharply I should
feel ashamed of being caught laughing at anything connected with the
Bible

And poor Joe became suddenly quite serious This was the first time
that Mrs Bunting had ever spoken really nastily to him and he
answered very humbly I beg pardon I know I oughtnt to have
laughed at anything to do with the Bible but you see Miss Daisy
said it so funnylike and by all accounts your lodger must be a
queer card Mrs Bunting

Hes no queerer than many people I could mention she said quickly
and with these enigmatic words she got up and left the room



CHAPTER XXIV

Each hour of the days that followed held for Bunting its full meed
of aching fear and suspense

The unhappy man was ever debating within himself what course he
should pursue and according to his mood and to the state of his
mind at any particular moment he would waver between various
widelydiffering lines of action

He told himself again and again and with fretful unease that the
most awful thing about it all was that he wasnt sure If only he
could have been sure he might have made up his mind exactly what
it was he ought to do

But when telling himself this he was deceiving himself and he was
vaguely conscious of the fact for from Buntings point of view
almost any alternative would have been preferable to that which to
some nay perhaps to most householders would have seemed the only
thing to do namely to go to the police But Londoners of Buntings
class have an uneasy fear of the law To his mind it would be ruin
for him and for his Ellen to be mixed up publicly in such a terrible
affair No one concerned in the business would give them and their
future a thought but it would track them to their dying day and
above all it would make it quite impossible for them ever to get
again into a good joint situation It was that for which Bunting
in his secret soul now longed with all his heart

No some other way than going to the police must be foundand he
racked his slow brain to find it

The worst of it was that every hour that went by made his future
course more difficult and more delicate and increased the awful
weight on his conscience

If only he really knew If only he could feel quite sure And
then he would tell himself that after all he had very little to
go upon only suspicionsuspicion and a secret horrible
certainty that his suspicion was justified

And so at last Bunting began to long for a solution which he knew
to be indefensible from every point of view he began to hope that
is in the depths of his heart that the lodger would again go out
one evening on his horrible business and be caughtredhanded

But far from going out on any business horrible or other Mr
Sleuth now never went out at all He kept upstairs and often spent
quite a considerable part of his day in bed He still felt so he
assured Mrs Bunting very far from well He had never thrown off
the chill he had caught on that bitter night he and his landlord
had met on their several ways home

Joe Chandler too had become a terrible complication to Daisys
father The detective spent every waking hour that he was not on
duty with the Buntings and Bunting who at one time had liked him
so well and so cordially now became mortally afraid of him

But though the young man talked of little else than The Avenger
and though on one evening he described at immense length the
eccentriclooking gent who had given the barmaid a sovereign
picturing Mr Sleuth with such awful accuracy that both Bunting and
Mrs Bunting secretly and separately turned sick when they listened
to him he never showed the slightest interest in their lodger

At last there came a morning when Bunting and Chandler held a strange
conversation about The Avenger The young fellow had come in earlier
than usual and just as he arrived Mrs Bunting and Daisy were
starting out to do some shopping The girl would fain have stopped
behind but her stepmother had given her a very peculiar disagreeable
look daring her so to speak to be so forward and Daisy had gone
on with a flushed angry look on her pretty face

And then as young Chandler stepped through into the sittingroom
it suddenly struck Bunting that the young man looked unlike himself
indeed to the exbutlers apprehension there was something almost
threatening in Chandlers attitude

I want a word with you Mr Bunting he began abruptly falteringly
And Im glad to have the chance now that Mrs Bunting and Miss Daisy
are out

Bunting braced himself to hear the awful wordsthe accusation of
having sheltered a murderer the monster whom all the world was
seeking under his roof And then he remembered a phrase a
horrible legal phraseAccessory after the fact Yes he had
been that there wasnt any doubt about it

Yes he said What is it Joe and then the unfortunate man
sat down in his chair Yes he said again uncertainly for young
Chandler had now advanced to the table he was looking at Bunting
fixedlythe other thought threateningly Well out with it
Joe Dont keep me in suspense

And then a slight smile broke over the young mans face I dont
think what Ive got to say can take you by surprise Mr Bunting

And Bunting wagged his head in a way that might mean anythingyes
or no as the case might be

The two men looked at one another for what seemed a very very long
time to the elder of them And then making a great effort Joe
Chandler brought out the words Well I suppose you know what it
is I want to talk about Im sure Mrs Bunting would from a look
or two shes lately cast on me Its your daughterits Miss
Daisy

And then Bunting gave a kind of cry twixt a sob and a laugh
My girl he cried Good Lord Joe Is that all you wants to
talk about Why you fair frightened methat you did

And indeed the relief was so great that the room swam round as
he stared across it at his daughters lover that lover who was
also the embodiment of that now awful thing to him the law He
smiled rather foolishly at his visitor and Chandler felt a sharp
wave of irritation of impatience sweep over his goodnatured soul
Daisys father was an old stupidthats what he was

And then Bunting grew serious The room ceased to go round As
far as Im concerned he said with a good deal of solemnity even
a little dignity you have my blessing Joe Youre a very likely
young chap and I had a true respect for your father

Yes said Chandler thats very kind of you Mr Bunting But
how about herher herself

Bunting stared at him It pleased him to think that Daisy hadnt
given herself away as Ellen was always hinting the girl was doing

I cant answer for Daisy he said heavily Youll have to ask
her yourselfthats not a job any other man can do for you my lad

I never gets a chance I never sees her not by our two selves
said Chandler with some heat You dont seem to understand Mr
Bunting that I never do see Miss Daisy alone he repeated I
hear now that shes going away Monday and Ive only once had the
chance of a walk with her Mrs Buntings very particular not to
say pernickety in her ideas Mr Bunting

Thats a fault on the right side that iswith a young girl
said Bunting thoughtfully

And Chandler nodded He quite agreed that as regarded other young
chaps Mrs Bunting could not be too particular

Shes been brought up like a lady my Daisy has went on Bunting
with some pride That Old Aunt of hers hardly lets her out of her
sight

I was coming to the old aunt said Chandler heavily Mrs
Bunting she talks as if your daughter was going to stay with that
old woman the whole of her natural lifenow is that right Thats
what I wants to ask you Mr Buntingis that right

Ill say a word to Ellen dont you fear said Bunting abstractedly

His mind had wandered off away from Daisy and this nice young chap
to his now constant anxious preoccupation You come along
tomorrow he said and Ill see you gets your walk with Daisy
Its only right you and she should have a chance of seeing one
another without old folk being by else hows the girl to tell
whether she likes you or not For the matter of that you hardly
knows her Joe He looked at the young man consideringly

Chandler shook his head impatiently I knows her quite as well as
I wants to know her he said I made up my mind the very first
time I seed her Mr Bunting

No Did you really said Bunting Well come to think of it
I did so with her mother aye and years after with Ellen too
But I hope youll never want no second Chandler

God forbid said the young man under his breath And then he
asked rather longingly Dyou think theyll be out long now Mr
Bunting

And Bunting woke up to a due sense of hospitality Sit down sit
down do he said hastily I dont believe theyll be very long
Theyve only got a little bit of shopping to do

And then in a changed in a ringing nervous tone he asked And
how about your job Joe Nothing new I take it I suppose youre
all just waiting for the next time

Ayethats about the figure of it Chandlers voice had also
changed it was now sombre menacing Were fair tired of it
beginning to wonder when itll end that we are

Do you ever try and make to yourself a picture of what the masters
like asked Bunting Somehow he felt he must ask that

Yes said Joe slowly Ive a sort of notiona savage
fiercelooking devil the chap must be Its that description that
was circulated put us wrong I dont believe it was the man that
knocked up against that woman in the fogno not one bit I dont
But I wavers I cant quite make up my mind Sometimes I think its
a sailorthe foreigner they talks about that goes away for eight
or nine days in between to Holland maybe or to France Then
again I says to myself that its a butcher a man from the Central
Market Whoever it is its someone used to killing thats flat

Then it dont seem to you possible Bunting got up and walked
over to the window You dont take any stock I suppose in that
idea some of the papers put out that the man isthen he
hesitated and brought out with a gaspa gentleman

Chandler looked at him surprised No he said deliberately
Ive made up my mind thats quite a wrong tack though I knows that
some of our fellowsbig pots tooare quite sure that the fellow
what gave the girl the sovereign is the man were looking for You
see Mr Bunting if thats the factwell it stands to reason the
fellows an escaped lunatic and if hes an escaped lunatic hes got
a keeper and theyd be raising a hue and cry after him now
wouldnt they

You dont think went on Bunting lowering his voice that he
could be just staying somewhere lodging like

Dyou mean that The Avenger may be a toff staying in some
Westend hotel Mr Bunting Well things almost as funny as that
ud be have come to pass He smiled as if the notion was a funny
one

Yes something o that sort muttered Bunting

Well if your ideas correct Mr Bunting

I never said twas my idea said Bunting all in a hurry

Well if that ideas correct then twill make our task more
difficult than ever Why twould be looking for a needle in a
field of hay Mr Bunting But there I dont think its
anything quite so unlikely as thatnot myself I dont He
hesitated Theres some of ushe lowered his voicethat
hopes hell betake himself offThe Avenger I meanto another
big city to Manchester or to Edinburgh Thered be plenty of
work for him to do there and Chandler chuckled at his own grim
joke

And then to both mens secret relief for Bunting was now
mortally afraid of this discussion concerning The Avenger and
his doings they heard Mrs Buntings key in the lock

Daisy blushed rosyred with pleasure when she saw that young
Chandler was still there She had feared that when they got home
he would be gone the more so that Ellen just as if she was doing
it on purpose had lingered aggravatingly long over each small
purchase

Heres Joe come to ask if he can take Daisy out for a walk
blurted out Bunting

My mother says as how shed like you to come to tea over at
Richmond said Chandler awkwardly I just come in to see whether
we could fix it up Miss Daisy And Daisy looked imploringly at
her stepmother

Dyou mean nowthis minute asked Mrs Bunting tartly

No o course notBunting broke in hastily How you do go on
Ellen

What day did your mother mention would be convenient to her
asked Mrs Bunting looking at the young man satirically

Chandler hesitated His mother had not mentioned any special day
in fact his mother had shown a surprising lack of anxiety to
see Daisy at all But he had talked her round

How about Saturday suggested Bunting Thats Daisys birthday
Twould be a birthday treat for her to go to Richmond and shes
going back to Old Aunt on Monday

I cant go Saturday said Chandler disconsolately Im on duty
Saturday

Well then let it be Sunday said Bunting firmly And his wife
looked at him surprised he seldom asserted himself so much in her
presence

What do you say Miss Daisy said Chandler

Sunday would be very nice said Daisy demurely And then as the
young man took up his hat and as her stepmother did not stir Daisy
ventured to go out into the hall with him for a minute

Chandler shut the door behind them and so was spared the hearing
of Mrs Buntings whispered remark When I was a young woman folk
didnt gallivant about on Sunday those who was courting used to
go to church together decentlike



CHAPTER XXV

Daisys eighteenth birthday dawned uneventfully Her father gave
her what he had always promised she should have on her eighteenth
birthdaya watch It was a pretty little silver watch which
Bunting had bought secondhand on the last day he had been happy
it seemed a long long time ago now

Mrs Bunting thought a silver watch a very extravagant present but
she was far too wretched far too absorbed in her own thoughts to
trouble much about it Besides in such matters she had generally
had the good sense not to interfere between her husband and his
child

In the middle of the birthday morning Bunting went out to buy
himself some more tobacco He had never smoked so much as in the
last four days excepting perhaps the week that had followed on
his leaving service Smoking a pipe had then held all the exquisite
pleasure which we are told attaches itself to the eating of forbidden
fruit

His tobacco had now become his only relaxation it acted on his
nerves as an opiate soothing his fears and helping him to think
But he had been overdoing it and it was that which now made him
feel so jumpy so he assured himself when he found himself
starting at any casual sound outside or even when his wife spoke
to him suddenly

Just now Ellen and Daisy were down in the kitchen and Bunting
didnt quite like the sensation of knowing that there was only
one pair of stairs between Mr Sleuth and himself So he quietly
slipped out of the house without telling Ellen that he was going
out

In the last four days Bunting had avoided his usual haunts above
all he had avoided even passing the time of day to his
acquaintances and neighbours He feared with a great fear that
they would talk to him of a subject which because it filled his
mind to the exclusion of all else might make him betray the
knowledgeno not knowledge rather thethe suspicionthat
dwelt within him

But today the unfortunate man had a curious instinctive longing
for human companionshipcompanionship that is other than that
of his wife and of his daughter

This longing for a change of company finally led him into a small
populous thoroughfare hard by the Edgware Road There were more
people there than usual just now for the housewives of the
neighbourhood were doing their Saturday marketing for Sunday The
exbutler turned into a small oldfashioned shop where he generally
bought his tobacco

Bunting passed the time of day with the tobacconist and the two
fell into desultory talk but to his customers relief and surprise
the man made no allusion to the subject of which all the
neighbourhood must still be talking

And then quite suddenly while still standing by the counter and
before he had paid for the packet of tobacco he held in his hand
Bunting through the open door saw with horrified surprise that
Ellen his wife was standing alone outside a greengrocers shop
just opposite

Muttering a word of apology he rushed out of the shop and across
the road

Ellen he gasped hoarsely youve never gone and left my little
girl alone in the house with the lodger

Mrs Buntings face went yellow with fear I thought you was
indoors she cried You was indoors Whatever made you come out
for without first making sure Id stay in

Bunting made no answer but as they stared at each other in
exasperated silence each now knew that the other knew

They turned and scurried down the crowded street Dont run he
said suddenly we shall get there just as quickly if we walk fast
People are noticing you Ellen Dont run

He spoke breathlessly but it was breathlessness induced by fear
and by excitement not by the quick pace at which they were walking

At last they reached their own gate and Bunting pushed past in
front of his wife

After all Daisy was his child Ellen couldnt know how he was
feeling

He seemed to take the path in one leap then fumbled for a moment
with his latchkey

Opening wide the door Daisy he called out in a wailing voice
Daisy my dear where are you

Here I am father What is it

Shes all right Bunting turned a grey face to his wife Shes
all right Ellen

He waited a moment leaning against the wall of the passage It
did give me a turn he said and then warningly Dont frighten
the girl Ellen

Daisy was standing before the fire in their sitting room admiring
herself in the glass

Oh father she exclaimed without turning round Ive seen the
lodger Hes quite a nice gentleman though to be sure he does
look a cure He rang his bell but I didnt like to go up and so
he came down to ask Ellen for something We had quite a nice
little chatthat we had I told him it was my birthday and he
asked me and Ellen to go to Madame Tussauds with him this
afternoon She laughed a little selfconsciously Of course
I could see he was centric and then at first he spoke so funnily
And who be you he says threateninglike And I says to him
Im Mr Buntings daughter sir Then youre a very fortunate
girlthats what he says Ellento ave such a nice
stepmother as youve got Thats why he says you look such
a good innocent girl And then he quoted a bit of the Prayer
Book Keep innocency he says wagging his head at me Lor
It made me feel as if I was with Old Aunt again

I wont have you going out with the lodgerthats flat

Bunting spoke in a muffled angry tone He was wiping his forehead
with one hand while with the other he mechanically squeezed the
little packet of tobacco for which as he now remembered he had
forgotten to pay

Daisy pouted Oh father I think you might let me have a treat
on my birthday I told him that Saturday wasnt a very good day
at least so Id heardfor Madame Tussauds Then he said we
could go early while the fine folk are still having their dinners
She turned to her stepmother then giggled happily He particularly
said you was to come too The lodger has a wonderful fancy for you
Ellen if I was father Id feel quite jealous

Her last words were cut across by a taptap on the door

Bunting and his wife looked at each other apprehensively Was it
possible that in their agitation they had left the front door
open and that someone some merciless myrmidon of the law had
crept in behind them

Both felt a curious thrill of satisfaction when they saw that it
was only Mr SleuthMr Sleuth dressed for going out the tall
hat he had worn when he had first come to them was in his hand but
he was wearing a coat instead of his Inverness cape

I heard you come inhe addressed Mrs Bunting in his high
whistling hesitating voiceand so Ive come down to ask you if
you and Miss Bunting will come to Madame Tussauds now I have
never seen those famous waxworks though Ive heard of the place
all my life

As Bunting forced himself to look fixedly at his lodger a sudden
doubt bringing with it a sense of immeasurable relief came to
Mr Sleuths landlord

Surely it was inconceivable that this gentle mildmannered
gentleman could be the monster of cruelty and cunning that Bunting
had now for the terrible space of four days believed him to be

He tried to catch his wifes eye but Mrs Bunting was looking away
staring into vacancy She still of course wore the bonnet and
cloak in which she had just been out to do her marketing Daisy
was already putting on her hat and coat

Well said Mr Sleuth Then Mrs Bunting turned and it seemed
to his landlady that he was looking at her threateningly Well

Yes sir Well come in a minute she said dully



CHAPTER XXVI

Madame Tussauds had hitherto held pleasant memories for Mrs Bunting
In the days when she and Bunting were courting they often spent there
part of their afternoonout

The butler had an acquaintance a man named Hopkins who was one of
the waxworks staff and this man had sometimes given him passes for
self and lady But this was the first time Mrs Bunting had been
inside the place since she had come to live almost next door as it
were to the big building

They walked in silence to the familiar entrance and then after
the illassorted trio had gone up the great staircase and into the
first gallery Mr Sleuth suddenly stopped short The presence of
those curious still waxen figures which suggest so strangely death
in life seemed to surprise and affright him

Daisy took quick advantage of the lodgers hesitation and unease

Oh Ellen she cried do let us begin by going into the Chamber
of Horrors Ive never been in there Old Aunt made father promise
he wouldnt take me the only time Ive ever been here But now that
Im eighteen I can do just as I like besides Old Aunt will never
know

Mr Sleuth looked down at her and a smile passed for a moment over
his worn gaunt face

Yes he said let us go into the Chamber of Horrors thats a
good idea Miss Bunting Ive always wanted to see the Chamber of
Horrors

They turned into the great room in which the Napoleonic relics were
then kept and which led into the curious vaultlike chamber where
waxen effigies of dead criminals stand grouped in wooden docks

Mrs Bunting was at once disturbed and relieved to see her husbands
old acquaintance Mr Hopkins in charge of the turnstile admitting
the public to the Chamber of Horrors

Well you are a stranger the man observed genially I do believe
that this is the very first time Ive seen you in here Mrs Bunting
since you was married

Yes she said that is so And this is my husbands daughter
Daisy I expect youve heard of her Mr Hopkins And thisshe
hesitated a momentis our lodger Mr Sleuth

But Mr Sleuth frowned and shuffled away Daisy leaving her
stepmothers side joined him

Two as all the world knows is company three is none Mrs
Bunting put down three sixpences

Wait a minute said Hopkins you cant go into the Chamber of
Horrors just yet But you wont have to wait more than four or
five minutes Mrs Bunting Its this way you see our boss is
in there showing a party round He lowered his voice Its
Sir John BurneyI suppose you know who Sir John Burney is

No she answered indifferently I dont know that I ever heard
of him

She felt slightlyoh very sightlyuneasy about Daisy She
would have liked her stepdaughter to keep well within sight and
sound but Mr Sleuth was now taking the girl down to the other
end of the room

Well I hope you never will know himnot in any personal sense
Mrs Bunting The man chuckled Hes the Commissioner of Police
the new onethats what Sir John Burney is One of the
gentlemen hes showing round our place is the Paris Police boss
whose job is on all fours so to speak with Sir Johns The
Frenchy has brought his daughter with him and there are several
other ladies Ladies always likes horrors Mrs Bunting thats
our experience here Oh take me to the Chamber of Horrors
thats what they say the minute they gets into this here building

Mrs Bunting looked at him thoughtfully It occurred to Mr Hopkins
that she was very wan and tired she used to look better in the old
days when she was still in service before Bunting married her

Yes she said thats just what my stepdaughter said just now
Oh take me to the Chamber of Horrorsthats exactly what she
did say when we got upstairs



A group of people all talking and laughing together were advancing
from within the wooden barrier toward the turnstile

Mrs Bunting stared at them nervously She wondered which of them
was the gentleman with whom Mr Hopkins had hoped she would never be
brought into personal contact she thought she could pick him out
among the others He was a tall powerful handsome gentleman with
a military appearance

Just now he was smiling down into the face of a young lady
Monsieur Barberoux is quite right he was saying in a loud
cheerful voice our English law is too kind to the criminal
especially to the murderer If we conducted our trials in the
French fashion the place we have just left would be very much
fuller than it is today A man of whose guilt we are absolutely
assured is oftener than not acquitted and then the public taunt
us with another undiscovered crime

Dyou mean Sir John that murderers sometimes escape scotfree
Take the man who has been committing all these awful murders this
last month I suppose theres no doubt hell be hangedif hes
ever caught that is

Her girlish voice rang out and Mrs Bunting could hear every word
that was said

The whole party gathered round listening eagerly Well no
He spoke very deliberately I doubt if that particular murderer
ever will be hanged

You mean that youll never catch him the girl spoke with a touch
of airy impertinence in her clear voice

I think we shall end by catching himbecausehe waited a moment
then added in a lower voicenow dont give me away to a newspaper
fellow Miss Rosebecause now I think we do know who the murderer
in question is

Several of those standing near by uttered expressions of surprise and
incredulity

Then why dont you catch him cried the girl indignantly

I didnt say we knew where he was I only said we knew who he was
or rather perhaps I ought to say that I personally have a very
strong suspicion of his identity

Sir Johns French colleague looked up quickly De Leipsic and
Liverpool man he said interrogatively

The other nodded Yes I suppose youve had the case turned up

Then speaking very quickly as if he wished to dismiss the subject
from his own mind and from that of his auditors he went on

Four murders of the kind were committed eight years agotwo in
Leipsic the others just afterwards in Liverpooland there were
certain peculiarities connected with the crimes which made it clear
they were committed by the same hand The perpetrator was caught
fortunately for us redhanded just as he was leaving the house of
his last victim for in Liverpool the murder was committed in a
house I myself saw the unhappy manI say unhappy for there is
no doubt at all that he was madhe hesitated and added in a
lower tonesuffering from an acute form of religious mania
I myself saw him as I say at some length But now comes the really
interesting point I have just been informed that a month ago this
criminal lunatic as we must of course regard him made his escape
from the asylum where he was confined He arranged the whole
thing with extraordinary cunning and intelligence and we should
probably have caught him long ago were it not that he managed when
on his way out of the place to annex a considerable sum of money
in gold with which the wages of the asylum staff were about to be
paid It is owing to that fact that his escape was very wrongly
concealed

He stopped abruptly as if sorry he had said so much and a moment
later the party were walking in Indian file through the turnstile
Sir John Burney leading the way

Mrs Bunting looked straight before her She feltso she
expressed it to her husband lateras if she had been turned to
stone

Even had she wished to do so she had neither the time nor the power
to warn her lodger of his danger for Daisy and her companion were
now coming down the room bearing straight for the Commissioner of
Police In another moment Mrs Buntings lodger and Sir John Burney
were face to face

Mr Sleuth swerved to one side there came a terrible change over
his pale narrow face it became discomposed livid with rage and
terror

But to Mrs Buntings reliefyes to her inexpressible relief
Sir John Burney and his friends swept on They passed Mr Sleuth
and the girl by his side unaware or so it seemed to her that
there was anyone else in the room but themselves

Hurry up Mrs Bunting said the turnstilekeeper you and your
friends will have the place all to yourselves for a bit From an
official he had become a man and it was the man in Mr Hopkins that
gallantly addressed pretty Daisy Bunting It seems strange that a
young lady like you should want to go in and see all those orrible
frights he said jestingly

Mrs Bunting may I trouble you to come over here for a moment

The words were hissed rather than spoken by Mr Sleuths lips

His landlady took a doubtful step towards him

A last word with you Mrs Bunting The lodgers face was still
distorted with fear and passion Do not think to escape the
consequences of your hideous treachery I trusted you Mrs Bunting
and you betrayed me Put I am protected by a higher power for
I still have much to do Then his voice sinking to a whisper he
hissed out Your end will be bitter as wormwood and sharp as a
twoedged sword Your feet shall go down to death and your steps
take hold on hell

Even while Mr Sleuth was muttering these strange dreadful words
he was looking round glancing this way and that seeking a way of
escape

At last his eyes became fixed on a small placard placed above a
curtain Emergency Exit was written there Mrs Bunting thought
he was going to make a dash for the place but Mr Sleuth did
something very different Leaving his landladys side he walked
over to the turnstile he fumbled in his pocket for a moment and
then touched the man on the arm I feel ill he said speaking
very rapidly very ill indeed It is the atmosphere of this place
I want you to let me out by the quickest way It would be a pity
for me to faint hereespecially with ladies about

His left hand shot out and placed what he had been fumbling for in
his pocket on the others bare palm I see theres an emergency
exit over there Would it be possible for me to get out that way

Well yes sir I think so

The man hesitated he felt a slight a very sight feeling of
misgiving He looked at Daisy flushed and smiling happy and
unconcerned and then at Mrs Bunting She was very pale but
surely her lodgers sudden seizure was enough to make her feel
worried Hopkins felt the halfsovereign pleasantly tickling his
palm The Paris Prefect of Police had given him only halfacrown
mean shabby foreigner

Yes sir I can let you out that way he said at last and praps
when youre standing out in the air on the iron balcony youll feel
better But then you know sir youll have to come round to the
front if you wants to come in again for those emergency doors only
open outward

Yes yes said Mr Sleuth hurriedly I quite understand If I
feel better Ill come in by the front way and pay another shilling
thats only fair

You neednt do that if youll just explain what happened here

The man went and pulled the curtain aside and put his shoulder
against the door It burst open and the light for a moment
blinded Mr Sleuth

He passed his hand over his eyes Thank you he muttered thank
you I shall get all right out there

An iron stairway led down into a small stable yard of which the
door opened into a side street

Mr Sleuth looked round once more he really did feel very ill
ill and dazed How pleasant it would be to take a flying leap over
the balcony railing and find rest eternal rest below

But nohe thrust the thought the temptation from him Again a
convulsive look of rage came over his face He had remembered his
landlady How could the woman whom he had treated so generously have
betrayed him to his archenemyto the official that is who had
entered into a conspiracy years ago to have him confinedhim an
absolutely sane man with a great avenging work to do in the world
in a lunatic asylum

He stepped out into the open air and the curtain fallingto behind
him blotted out the tall thin figure from the little group of
people who had watched him disappear

Even Daisy felt a little scared He did look bad didnt he now
she turned appealingly to Mr Hopkins

Yes that he did poor gentlemanyour lodger too he looked
sympathetically at Mrs Bunting

She moistened her lips with her tongue Yes she repeated dully
my lodger



CHAPTER XXVII

In vain Mr Hopkins invited Mrs Bunting and her pretty stepdaughter
to step through into the Chamber of Horrors I think we ought to
go straight home said Mr Sleuths landlady decidedly And Daisy
meekly assented Somehow the girl felt confused a little scared by
the lodgers sudden disappearance Perhaps this unwonted feeling of
hers was induced by the look of stunned surprise and yes pain on
her stepmothers face

Slowly they made their way out of the building and when they got
home it was Daisy who described the strange way Mr Sleuth had been
taken

I dont suppose hell be long before he comes home said Bunting
heavily and he cast an anxious furtive look at his wife She
looked as if stricken in a vital part he saw from her face that
there was something wrongvery wrong indeed

The hours dragged on All three felt moody and ill at ease Daisy
knew there was no chance that young Chandler would come in today

About six oclock Mrs Bunting went upstairs She lit the gas in
Mr Sleuths sittingroom and looked about her with a fearful glance
Somehow everything seemed to speak to her of the lodger there lay
her Bible and his Concordance side by side on the table exactly
as he had left them when he had come downstairs and suggested that
illstarred expedition to his landlords daughter She took a few
steps forward listening the while anxiously for the familiar sound
of the click in the door which would tell her that the lodger had
come back and then she went over to the window and looked out

What a cold night for a man to be wandering about homeless
friendless and as she suspected with a pang with but very little
money on him

Turning abruptly she went into the lodgers bedroom and opened the
drawer of the lookingglass

Yes there lay the muchdiminished heap of sovereigns If only he
had taken his money out with him She wondered painfully whether he
had enough on his person to secure a good nights lodging and then
suddenly she remembered that which brought relief to her mind The
lodger had given something to that Hopkins felloweither a sovereign
or half a sovereign she wasnt sure which

The memory of Mr Sleuths cruel words to her of his threat did
not disturb her overmuch It had been a mistakeall a mistake
Far from betraying Mr Sleuth she had sheltered himkept his awful
secret as she could not have kept it had she known or even dimly
suspected the horrible fact with which Sir John Burneys words had
made her acquainted namely that Mr Sleuth was victim of no
temporary aberration but that he was and had been for years a
madman a homicidal maniac

In her ears there still rang the Frenchmans half careless yet
confident question De Leipsic and Liverpool man

Following a sudden impulse she went back into the sittingroom
and taking a blackheaded pin out of her bodice stuck it amid the
leaves of the Bible Then she opened the Book and looked at the
page the pin had marked

My tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken   
There is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my
curtains

At last leaving the Bible open Mrs Bunting went downstairs and
as she opened the door of her sittingroom Daisy came towards her
stepmother

Ill go down and start getting the lodgers supper ready for you
said the girl goodnaturedly Hes certain to come in when he gets
hungry But he did look upset didnt he Ellen Right down bad
that he did

Mrs Bunting made no answer she simply stepped aside to allow Daisy
to go down

Mr Sleuth wont never come back no more she said sombrely and
then she felt both glad and angry at the extraordinary change which
came over her husbands face Yet perversely that look of relief
of rightdown joy chiefly angered her and tempted her to add
Thats to say I dont suppose he will

And Buntings face altered again the old anxious depressed look
the look it had worn the last few days returned

What makes you think he maynt come back he muttered

Too long to tell you now she said Wait till the childs gone
to bed

And Bunting had to restrain his curiosity

And then when at last Daisy had gone off to the back room where
she now slept with her stepmother Mrs Bunting beckoned to her
husband to follow her upstairs

Before doing so he went down the passage and put the chain on the
door And about this they had a few sharp whispered words

Youre never going to shut him out she expostulated angrily
beneath her breath

Im not going to leave Daisy down here with that man perhaps
walking in any minute

Mr Sleuth wont hurt Daisy bless you Much more likely to hurt
me and she gave a half sob

Bunting stared at her What do you mean he said roughly
Come upstairs and tell me what you mean

And then in what had been the lodgers sittingroom Mrs Bunting
told her husband exactly what it was that had happened

He listened in heavy silence

So you see she said at last you see Bunting that twas me
that was right after all The lodger was never responsible for
his actions I never thought he was for my part

And Bunting stared at her ruminatingly Depends on what you call
responsible he began argumentatively

But she would have none of that I heard the gentleman say myself
that he was a lunatic she said fiercely And then dropping her
voice A religious maniacthats what he called him

Well he never seemed so to me said Bunting stoutly He simply
seemed to me centricthats all he did Not a bit madder than
many I could tell you of He was walking round the room restlessly
but he stopped short at last And what dyou think we ought to do
now

Mrs Bunting shook her head impatiently I dont think we ought
to do nothing she said Why should we

And then again he began walking round the room in an aimless fashion
that irritated her

If only I could put out a bit of supper for him somewhere where he
would get it And his money too I hate to feel its in there

Dont you make any mistakehell come back for that said Bunting
with decision

But Mrs Bunting shook her head She knew better Now she said
you go off up to bed Its no use us sitting up any longer

And Bunting acquiesced

She ran down and got him a bedroom candlethere was no gas in the
little back bedroom upstairs And then she watched him go slowly up

Suddenly he turned and came down again Ellen he said in an
urgent whisper if I was you Id take the chain off the door and
Id lock myself inthats what Im going to do Then he can sneak
in and take his dirty money away

Mrs Bunting neither nodded nor shook her head Slowly she went
downstairs and there she carried out half of Buntings advice
She took that is the chain off the front door But she did not
go to bed neither did she lock herself in She sat up all night
waiting At halfpast seven she made herself a cup of tea and
then she went into her bedroom

Daisy opened her eyes

Why Ellen she said I suppose I was that tired and slept so
sound that I never heard you come to bed or get upfunny
wasnt it

Young people dont sleep as light as do old folks Mrs Bunting
said sententiously

Did the lodger come in after all I suppose hes upstairs now

Mrs Bunting shook her head It looks as if twould be a fine
day for you down at Richmond she observed in a kindly tone

And Daisy smiled a very happy confident little smile



That evening Mrs Bunting forced herself to tell young Chandler
that their lodger had so to speak disappeared She and Bunting
had thought carefully over what they would say and so well did
they carry out their programme or what is more likely so full
was young Chandler of the long happy day he and Daisy had spent
together that he took their news very calmly

Gone away has he he observed casually Well I hope he paid
up all right

Oh yes yes said Mrs Bunting hastily No trouble of that sort

And Bunting said shamefacedly Aye aye the lodger was quite an
honest gentleman Joe But I feel worried about him He was such
a poor gentle chapnot the sort o man one likes to think of as
wandering about by himself

You always said he was centric said Joe thoughtfully

Yes he was that said Bunting slowly Regular rightdown queer
Leetle touched you know under the thatch and as he tapped his
head significantly both young people burst out laughing

Would you like a description of him circulated asked Joe
goodnaturedly

Mr and Mrs Bunting looked at one another

No I dont think so Not yet awhile at any rate Twould upset
him awfully you see

And Joe acquiesced Youd be surprised at the number o people
who disappears and are never heard of again he said cheerfully
And then he got up very reluctantly

Daisy making no bones about it this time followed him out into
the passage and shut the sittingroom door behind her

When she came back she walked over to where her father was sitting
in his easy chair and standing behind him she put her arms round
his neck

Then she bent down her head Father she said Ive a bit of
news for you

Yes my dear

Father Im engaged Arent you surprised

Well what do you think said Bunting fondly Then he turned
round and catching hold of her head gave her a good hearty kiss

Whatll Old Aunt say I wonder he whispered

Dont you worry about Old Aunt exclaimed his wife suddenly
Ill manage Old Aunt Ill go down and see her She and I have
always got on pretty comfortable together as you knows well Daisy

Yes said Daisy a little wonderingly I know you have Ellen



Mr Sleuth never came back and at last after many days and many
nights had gone by Mrs Bunting left off listening for the click
of the lock which she at once hoped and feared would herald her
lodgers return

As suddenly and as mysteriously as they had begun the Avenger
murders stopped but there came a morning in the early spring when
a gardener working in the Regents Park found a newspaper in which
was wrapped together with a halfworn pair of rubbersoled shoes
a long peculiarly shaped knife The fact though of considerable
interest to the police was not chronicled in any newspaper but
about the same time a picturesque little paragraph went the round
of the press concerning a small boxful of sovereigns which had been
anonymously forwarded to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital

Meanwhile Mrs Bunting had been as good as her word about Old Aunt
and that lady had received the wonderful news concerning Daisy in a
more philosophical spirit than her greatniece had expected her to
do She only observed that it was odd to reflect that if gentlefolks
leave a house in charge of the police a burglary is pretty sure to
followa remark which Daisy resented much more than did her Joe


Mr Bunting and his Ellen are now in the service of an old
lady by whom they are feared as well as respected and whom they
make very comfortable
