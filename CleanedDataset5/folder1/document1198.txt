Preface to New Edition


I dedicate this ower true tale of the wilder aspects of Australian
life to my old comrade R Murray Smith late AgentGeneral in London for
the colony of Victoria with hearty thanks for the time and trouble he
has devoted to its publication I trust it will do no discredit to the
rising reputation of Australian romance But though presented in the
guise of fiction this chronicle of the Marston family must not be
set down by the reader as wholly fanciful or exaggerated Much of the
narrative is literally true as can be verified by official records
A lifelong residence in Australia may be accepted as a guarantee
for fidelity as to local colour and descriptive detail I take this
opportunity of acknowledging the prompt and liberal recognition of the
tale by the proprietors of the Sydney Mail but for which it might
never have seen the light

ROBBERY UNDER ARMS




Chapter 1


My names Dick Marston Sydneyside native Im twentynine years old
six feet in my stocking soles and thirteen stone weight Pretty strong
and active with it so they say I dont want to blownot here any
roadbut it takes a good man to put me on my back or stand up to me
with the gloves or the naked mauleys I can ride anythinganything
that ever was lapped in horsehideswim like a muskduck and track like
a Myall blackfellow Most things that a man can do Im up to and thats
all about it As I lift myself now I can feel the muscle swell on my arm
like a cricket ball in spite of thewell in spite of everything

The morning sun comes shining through the window bars and ever since he
was up have I been cursing the daylight cursing myself and them that
brought me into the world Did I curse mother and the hour I was born
into this miserable life

Why should I curse the day Why do I lie here groaning yes crying
like a child and beating my head against the stone floor I am not mad
though I am shut up in a cell No Better for me if I was But its all
up now theres no get away this time and I Dick Marston as strong as
a bullock as active as a rockwallaby chockfull of life and spirits
and health have been tried for bushrangingrobbery under arms they
call itand though the blood runs through my veins like the water in
the mountain creeks and every bit of bone and sinew is as sound as the
day I was born I must die on the gallows this day month

Diedieyes die be strung up like a dog as they say Im blessed
if ever I did know of a dog being hanged though if it comes to that
a shot or a bait generally makes an end of em in this country Ha ha
Did I laugh What a rum thing it is that a man should have a laugh in
him when hes only got twentynine days more to livea day for every
year of my life Well laughing or crying this is what it has come to
at last All the drinking and recklessness the flash talk and the idle
ways the merry crosscountry rides that we used to have night or
day it made no odds to us every man well mounted as like as not on a
racehorse in training taken out of his stable within the week the sharp
brushes with the police when now and then a man was wounded on each
side but no one killed That came later on worse luck The jolly
sprees we used to have in the bush townships where we chucked our money
about like gentlemen where all the girls had a smile and a kind word
for a lot of game upstanding chaps that acted like men if they did
keep the road a little lively Our bush telegraphs were safe to let
us know when the traps were closing in on us and thenwhy the coach
would be stuck up a hundred miles away in a different direction
within twentyfour hours Marstons gang again The police are in
pursuit Thats what wed see in the papers We had em sent to us
regular besides having the pick of em when we cut open the mail bags

And nowthat chain rubbed a sore curse itall that rackets over
Its more than hard to die in this settled infernal fixed sort of way
like a bullock in the killingyard all ready to be pithed I used to
pity them when I was a boy walking round the yard pushing their noses
through the rails trying for a likely place to jump stamping and
pawing and roaring and knocking their heads against the heavy close
rails with misery and rage in their eyes till their time was up
Nobody told THEM beforehand though

Have I and the likes of me ever felt much the same I wonder shut up
in a pen like this with the rails up and not a place a rat could creep
through waiting till our killing time was come The poor devils of
steers have never done anything but ramble off the run now and again
while webut its too late to think of that It IS hard Theres no
saying it isnt no nor thinking what a fool what a blind stupid
thundering idiot a fellows been to laugh at the steady working life
that would have helped him up bit by bit to a good farm a good wife
and innocent little kids about him like that chap George Storefield
that came to see me last week He was real rightdown sorry for me
I could tell though Jim and I used to laugh at him and call him a
regular old crawler of a milkers calf in the old days The tears came
into his eyes reglar like a woman as he gave my hand a squeeze and
turned his head away We was little chaps together you know A man
always feels that you know And old George hell go backa fiftymile
ride but whats that on a good horse Hell be late home but he can
cross the rock ford the short way over the creek I can see him turn his
horse loose at the gardengate and walk through the quinces that lead
up to the cottage with his saddle on his arm Cant I see it all as
plain as if I was there

And his wife and the young uns ll run out when they hear fathers
horse and want to hear all the news When he goes in theres his meal
tidy and decent waiting for him while he tells them about the poor chap
hes been to see as is to be scragged next month Ha ha what a rum
joke it is isnt it

And then hell go out in the verandah with the roses growin all over
the posts and smellin sweet in the cool night air After that hell
have his smoke and sit there thinkin about me perhaps and old days
and what not till all hourstill his wife comes and fetches him in
And here I liemy God why didnt they knock me on the head when I was
born like a lamb in a dry season or a blind puppyblind enough God
knows They do so in some countries if the books say true and what a
hell of misery that must save some people from

Well its done now and theres no get away I may as well make the
best of it A sergeant of police was shot in our last scrimmage and
they must fit some one over that Its only natural He was rash or
Starlight would never have dropped him that day Not if hed been sober
either Wed been drinking all night at that Willow Tree shanty Bad
grog too When a mans half drunk hes fit for any devilment that
comes before him Drink How do you think a chap thats taken to the
bushregularly turned out I mean with a price on his head and a
fire burning in his heart night and daycan stand his life if he dont
drink When he thinks of what he might have been and what he is Why
nearly every man he meets is paid to run him down or trap him some way
like a stray dog thats taken to sheepkillin He knows a score of men
and women too that are only looking out for a chance to sell his blood
on the quiet and pouch the money Do you think that makes a chap mad
and miserable and tired of his life or not And if a drop of grog
will take him right out of his wretched self for a bit why shouldnt he
drink People dont know what they are talking about Why he is that
miserable that he wonders why he dont hang himself and save the
Government all the trouble and if a few nobblers make him feel as if
he might have some good chances yet and that it doesnt so much matter
after all why shouldnt he drink

He does drink of course every miserable man and a good many women as
have something to fear or repent of drink The worst of it is that
too much of it brings on the horrors and then the devil instead of
giving you a jog now and then sends one of his imps to grin in your
face and pull your heartstrings all day and all night long By George
Im getting clevertoo clever altogether I think If I could forget
for one moment in the middle of all the nonsense that I was to die
on Thursday three weeks die on Thursday three weeks die on Thursday
Thats the way the time runs in my ears like a chime of bells But its
all mere bosh Ive been reading these long six months Ive been chained
up hereafter I was committed for trial When I came out of the
hospital after curing me of that woundfor I was hit bad by that black
trackerthey gave me some books to read for fear Id go mad and cheat
the hangman I was always fond of reading and many a night Ive read to
poor old mother and Aileen before I left the old place I was that weak
and low after I took the turn and I felt glad to get a book to take
me away from sitting staring and blinking at nothing by the hour
together It was all very well then I was too weak to think much But
when I began to get well again I kept always coming across something in
the book that made me groan or cry out as if some one had stuck a knife
in me A dark chap did oncethrough the ribsit didnt feel so bad a
little sharpish at first why didnt he aim a bit higher He never was
no good even at that As I was saying thered be something about a
horse or the country or the spring weatherits just coming in now
and the Indian corns shooting after the rain and ILL never see it or
theyd put in a bit about the cows walking through the river in the hot
summer afternoons or theyd go describing about a girl until I began
to think of sister Aileen again then Id run my head against the wall
or do something like a madman and theyd stop the books for a week and
Id be as miserable as a bandicoot worse and worse a lot with all
the devils tricks and bad thoughts in my head and nothing to put them
away

I must either kill myself or get something to fill up my time till
the dayyes the day comes Ive always been a middling writer tho I
cant say much for the grammar and spelling and that but Ill put it
all down from the beginning to the end and maybe itll save some other
unfortunate young chap from pulling back like a colt when hes first
roped setting himself against everything in the way of proper breaking
making a fool of himself generally and choking himself down as Ive
done

The gaolerhe looks hardhe has to do that theres more than one
or two within here that would have him by the throat with his hearts
blood running in half a minute if they had their way and the warder
was off guard He knows that very well But hes not a badhearted chap

You can have books or paper and pens anything you like he said
you unfortunate young beggar until youre turned off

If Id only had you to see after me when I was young says I

Come dont whine he said then he burst out laughing You didnt
mean it I see I ought to have known better Youre not one of that
sort and I like you all the better for it

     

Well here goes Lots of pens a big bottle of ink and ever so much
foolscap paper the right sort for me or I shouldnt have been here
Im blessed if it doesnt look as if I was going to write copies again
Dont I remember how I used to go to school in old times the rides
there and back on the old pony and pretty little Grace Storefield that
I was so fond of and used to show her how to do her lessons I believe
I learned more that way than if Id had only myself to think about
There was another girl the daughter of the poundkeeper that I wanted
her to beat and the way we both worked and I coached her up was a
caution And she did get above her in her class How proud we were She
gave me a kiss too and a bit of her hair Poor Gracey I wonder where
she is now and what shed think if she saw me here today If I could
have looked ahead and seen myselfchained now like a dog and going to
die a dogs death this day month

Anyhow I must make a start How do people begin when they set to work
to write their own sayings and doings Theres been a deal more doing
than talking in my lifeit was the wrong sortmores the pity

Well lets see his parents were poor but respectable Thats what
they always say My parents were poor and mother was as good a soul as
ever broke bread and wouldnt have taken a shillings worth that wasnt
her own if shed been starving But as for father hed been a poacher
in England a Lincolnshire man he was and got sent out for it He
wasnt much more than a boy he said and it was only for a hare or
two which didnt seem much But I begin to think being able to see the
right of things a bit now and having no bad grog inside of me to turn a
fellows head upside down as poaching must be something like cattle
and horse duffingnot the worst thing in the world itself but mighty
likely to lead to it

Dad had always been a hardworking steadygoing sort of chap good at
most things and like a lot more of the Government men as the convicts
were always called round our part he saved some money as soon as he had
done his time and married mother who was a simple emigrant girl
just out from Ireland Father was a squarebuilt goodlooking chap
I believe then not so tall as I am by three inches but wonderfully
strong and quick on his pins They did say as he could hammer any man
in the district before he got old and stiff I never saw him shape but
once and then he rolled into a man big enough to eat him and polished
him off in a way that showed methough I was a bit of a boy thenthat
hed been at the game before He didnt ride so bad either though he
hadnt had much of it where he came from but he was afraid of nothing
and had a quiet way with colts He could make pretty good play in thick
country and ride a roughish horse too

Well our farm was on a good little flat with a big mountain in front
and a scrubby rangy country at the back for miles People often asked
him why he chose such a place It suits me he used to say with a
laugh and talk of something else We could only raise about enough corn
and potatoes in a general way for ourselves from the flat but there
were other chances and pickings which helped to make the pot boil and
them wed have been a deal better without

First of all though our cultivation paddock was small and the good
land seemed squeezed in between the hills there was a narrow tract up
the creek and here it widened out into a large wellgrassed flat This
was where our cattle ran for of course we had a team of workers and
a few milkers when we came No one ever took up a farm in those days
without a dray and a team a years rations a few horses and milkers
pigs and fowls and a little furniture They didnt collar a 40acre
selection as they do nowspend all their money in getting the land and
squat down as bare as robinsa man with his wife and children all
under a sheet of bark nothing on their backs and very little in their
bellies However some of them do pretty well though they do say they
have to live on possums for a time We didnt do much in spite of our
grand start

The flat was well enough but there were other places in the gullies
beyond that that father had dropped upon when he was out shooting He
was a tremendous chap for poking about on foot or on horseback and
though he was an Englishman he was what you call a born bushman I
never saw any man almost as was his equal Wherever hed been once
there he could take you to again and what was more if it was in the
dead of the night he could do it just the same People said he was as
good as a blackfellow but I never saw one that was as good as he was
all round In a strange country too That was what beat mehed know
the way the creek run and noticed when the cattle headed to camp and
a lot of things that other people couldnt see or if they did couldnt
remember again He was a great man for solitary walks toohe and an
old dog he had called Crib a crossbred mongrellooking brute most
like what they call a lurcher in England father said Anyhow he could
do most anything but talk He could bite to some purpose drive cattle
or sheep catch a kangaroo if it wasnt a regular flyer fight like a
bulldog and swim like a retriever track anything and fetch and carry
but bark he wouldnt Hed stand and look at dad as if he worshipped
him and hed make him some sign and off hed go like a child thats got
a message Why he was so fond of the old man we boys couldnt make out
We were afraid of him and as far as we could see he never patted or
made much of Crib He thrashed him unmerciful as he did us boys Still
the dog was that fond of him youd think hed like to die for him there
and then But dogs are not like boys or men eitherbetter perhaps

Well we were all born at the hut by the creek I suppose for I
remember it as soon as I could remember anything It was a snug hut
enough for father was a good bush carpenter and didnt turn his
back to any one for splitting and fencing hutbuilding and
shinglesplitting he had had a year or two at sawing too but after
he was married he dropped that But Ive heard mother say that he took
great pride in the hut when he brought her to it first and said it was
the bestbuilt hut within fifty miles He split every slab cut every
post and wallplate and rafter himself with a man to help him at odd
times and after the frame was up and the bark on the roof he camped
underneath and finished every bit of itchimney flooring doors
windows and partitionsby himself Then he dug up a little garden
in front and planted a dozen or two peaches and quinces in it put a
couple of rosesa red and a white oneby the posts of the verandah
and it was all ready for his pretty Norah as she says he used to call
her then If Ive heard her tell about the garden and the quince trees
and the two roses once Ive heard her tell it a hundred times Poor
mother we used to get round herAileen and Jim and Iand say Tell
us about the garden mother Shed never refuse those were her happy
days she always said She used to cry afterwardsnearly always

The first thing almost that I can remember was riding the old pony
Possum out to bring in the milkers Father was away somewhere so
mother took us all out and put me on the pony and let me have a
whip Aileen walked alongside and very proud I was My legs stuck out
straight on the old ponys fat back Mother had ridden him up when she
camethe first horse she ever rode she said He was a quiet little old
roan with a bright eye and legs like gateposts but he never fell down
with us boys for all that If we fell off he stopped still and began
to feed so that he suited us all to pieces We soon got sharp enough
to flail him along with a quince stick and we used to bring up the
milkers I expect a good deal faster than was good for them After a
bit we could milk legrope and bail up for ourselves and help dad
brand the calves which began to come pretty thick There were only
three of us childrenmy brother Jim who was two years younger than I
was and then Aileen who was four years behind him I know we were both
able to nurse the baby a while after she came and neither of us wanted
better fun than to be allowed to watch her or rock the cradle or as a
great treat to carry her a few steps Somehow we was that fond and proud
of her from the first that wed have done anything in the world for her
And so we would nowI was going to saybut that poor Jim lies under a
forest oak on a sandhill and Iwell Im here and if Id listened
to her advice I should have been a free man A free man How it sounds
doesnt it with the sun shining and the blue sky over your head and
the birds twittering and the grass beneath your feet I wonder if I
shall go mad before my times up

Mother was a Roman Catholicmost Irishwomen are and dad was a
Protestant if he was anything However that says nothing People that
dont talk much about their religion or follow it up at all wont
change it for all that So father though mother tried him hard enough
when they were first married wouldnt hear of turning not if he was to
be killed for it as I once heard him say No he says my father and
grandfather and all the lot was Church people and so I shall live
and die I dont know as it would make much matter to me but such as
my notions is I shall stick to em as long as the craft holds together
You can bring up the girl in your own way its made a good woman of
you or found you one which is most likely and so she may take her
chance But I stand for Church and King and so shall the boys as sure
as my names Ben Marston




Chapter 2



Father was one of those people that gets shut of a deal of trouble in
this world by always sticking to one thing If he said hed do this or
that he always did it and nothing else As for turning him a wild bull
halfway down a range was a likelier tryon So nobody ever bothered him
after hed once opened his mouth They knew it was so much lost labour
I sometimes thought Aileen was a bit like him in her way of sticking to
things But then she was always right you see

So that clinched it Mother gave in like a wise woman as she was The
clergyman from Bargo came one day and christened me and Jimmade one
job of it But mother took Aileen herself in the spring cart all the way
to the township and had her christened in the chapel in the middle of
the service all right and regular by Father Roche

Theres good and bad of every sort and Ive met plenty that were no
chop of all churches but if Father Roche or Father anybody else had
any hand in making mother and Aileen half as good as they were Id turn
tomorrow if I ever got out again I dont suppose it was the religion
that made much difference in our case for Patsey Daly and his three
brothers that lived on the creek higher up were as much on the cross
as men could be and many a time Ive seen them ride to chapel and
attend mass and look as if theyd never seen a clearskin in their
lives Patsey was hanged afterwards for bushranging and gold robbery
and he had more than one mans blood to answer for Now we werent like
that we never troubled the church one way or the other We knew we were
doing what we oughtnt to do and scorned to look pious and keep two
faces under one hood

By degrees we all grew older began to be active and able to do half a
mans work We learned to ride pretty wellat least that is we could
ride a barebacked horse at full gallop through timber or down a range
could back a colt just caught and have him as quiet as an old cow in
a week We could use the axe and the crosscut saw for father dropped
that sort of work himself and made Jim and I do all the rough jobs of
mending the fences getting firewood milking the cows and after a
bit ploughing the bit of flat we kept in cultivation

Jim and I when we were fifteen and thirteenhe was bigger for his
age than I was and so near my own strength that I didnt care about
touching himwere the smartest lads on the creek father saidhe
didnt often praise us either We had often ridden over to help at the
muster of the large cattle stations that were on the side of the range
and not more than twenty or thirty miles from us

Some of our young stock used to stray among the squatters cattle and
we liked attending the muster because there was plenty of galloping
about and cutting out and fun in the mens hut at night and often a
halfcrown or so for helping some one away with a big mob of cattle or
a lot for the pound Father didnt go himself and I used to notice that
whenever we came up and said we were Ben Marstons boys both master and
super looked rather glum and then appeared not to think any more about
it I heard the owner of one of these stations say to his managing man
Pity isnt it fine boys too I didnt understand what they meant I
do now

We could do a few things besides riding because as I told you before
we had been to a bit of a school kept by an old chap that had once seen
better days that lived three miles off near a little bush township
This village like most of these places had a publichouse and a
blacksmiths shop That was about all The publican kept the store and
managed pretty well to get hold of all the money that was made by the
people round about that is of those that were good drinking men He
had halfadozen children and though he was not up to much he wasnt
that bad that he didnt want his children to have the chance of being
better than himself Ive seen a good many crooked people in my day but
very few that though theyd given themselves up as a bad job didnt
hope a bit that their youngsters mightnt take after them Curious
isnt it But it is true I can tell you So Lammerby the publican
though he was a greedy sly sort of fellow that bought things he knew
were stolen and lent out money and charged everybody two prices for the
things he sold em didnt like the thought of his children growing up
like Myall cattle as he said himself and so he fished out this old Mr
Howard that had been a friend or a victim or some kind of pal of his in
old times near Sydney and got him to come and keep school

He was a curious man this Mr Howard What he had been or done none
of us ever knew but he spoke up to one of the squatters that said
something sharp to him one day in a way that showed us boys that he
thought himself as good as he was And he stood up straight and looked
him in the face till we hardly could think he was the same man that
was so bent and shambling and brokendownlooking most times He used
to live in a little hut in the township all by himself It was just big
enough to hold him and us at our lessons He had his dinner at the inn
along with Mr and Mrs Lammerby She was always kind to him and made
him puddings and things when he was ill He was pretty often ill and
then hed hear us our lessons at the bedside and make a short day of
it

Mostly he drank nothing but tea He used to smoke a good deal out of a
big meerschaum pipe with figures on it that he used to show us when he
was in a good humour But two or three times a year he used to setto
and drink for a week and then school was left off till he was right
We didnt think much of that Everybody almost that we knew did the
sameall the mennearly all that isand some of the womennot
mother though she wouldnt have touched a drop of wine or spirits to
save her life and never did to her dying day We just thought of it
as if theyd got a touch of fever or sunstroke or broke a rib or
something Theyd get over it in a week or two and be all right again

All the same poor old Mr Howard wasnt always on the booze not by
any manner of means He never touched a drop of anything not even
gingerbeer while he was straight and he kept us all going from nine
oclock in the morning till three in the afternoon summer and winter
for more than six years Then he died poor old chapfound dead in his
bed one morning Many a basting he gave me and Jim with an old malacca
cane he had with a silver knob to it We were all pretty frightened of
him Hed say to me and Jim and the other boys Its the best chance
of making men of yourselves you ever had if you only knew it Youll be
rich farmers or settlers perhaps magistrates one of these daysthat
is if youre not hanged Its you I mean hed say pointing to me
and Jim and the Dalys I believe some of you WILL be hanged unless
you change a good deal Its cold blood and bad blood that runs in your
veins and youll come to earn the wages of sin some day Its a strange
thing he used to say as if he was talking to himself that the girls
are so good while the boys are delivered over to the Evil One except a
case here and there Look at Mary Darcy and Jane Lammerby and my
little pet Aileen here I defy any village in Britain to turn out such
girlsplenty of rosycheeked gigglersbut the natural refinement and
intelligence of these little damsels astonishes me

Well the old man died suddenly as I said and we were all very sorry
and the school was broken up But he had taught us all to write fairly
and to keep accounts to read and spell decently and to know a little
geography It wasnt a great deal but what we knew we knew well and
I often think of what he said now its too late we ought to have made
better use of it After school broke up father said Jim and I knew quite
as much as was likely to be any good to us and we must work for our
living like other people Wed always done a pretty fair share of that
and our hands were hard with using the axe and the spade let alone
holding the plough at odd times and harrowing helping father to kill
and brand and a lot of other things besides getting up while the stars
were in the sky so as to get the cows milked early before it was time
to go to school

All this time we had lived in a free kind of waywe wanted for nothing
We had plenty of good beef and a calf now and then About this time I
began to wonder how it was that so many cattle and horses passed through
fathers hands and what became of them

I hadnt lived all my life on Rocky Creek and among some of the
smartest hands in that line that old New South Wales ever bred without
knowing what clearskins and cross beasts meant and being well aware
that our brand was often put on a calf that no cow of ours ever suckled
Dont I remember well the first calf I ever helped to put our letters
on Ive often wished Id defied father then taken my licking and
bolted away from home Its that very calf and the things it led to
thats helped to put me where I am

Just as I sit here and these cursed irons rattle whenever I move my
feet I can see that very evening and father and the old dog with a
little mob of our crawling cattle and halfadozen head of strangers
cows and calves and a fat little steer coming through the scrub to the
old stockyard

It was an awkward place for a yard people used to say scrubby and
stony all round a blind sort of holeyou couldnt see till you were
right on the top of it But there was a wing ran out a good way
through the scrubtheres no better guide to a yard like thatand
there was a sort of track cattle followed easy enough once you were
round the hill Anyhow between father and the dog and the old mare he
always rode very few beasts ever broke away

These strange cattle had been driven a good way I could see The
cows and calves looked done up and the steers tongue was outit was
hottish weather the old dog had been heeling him up too for he was
bleeding up to the hocks and the end of his tail was bitten off He
was a savage old wretch was Crib Like all dogs that never barkand men
toohis bite was all the worse

Go and get the brandsconfound youdont stand there frightening the
cattle says father as the tired cattle after smelling and jostling a
bit rushed into the yard You Jim make a fire and look sharp about
it I want to brand old Pollys calf and another or two Father came
down to the hut while the brands were getting ready and began to look
at the harnesscask which stood in a little back skillion It was
pretty empty we had been living on eggs bacon and bread and butter
for a week

Oh mother theres such a pretty red calf in the yard I said with
a star and a white spot on the flank and theres a yellow steer fat
enough to kill

What said mother turning round and looking at father with her eyes
staringa sort of dark blue they werepeople used to say mine and
Jims were the same colourand her brown hair pushed back off her face
as if she was looking at a ghost Is it doing that again you are
after all you promised me and you so nearly caughtafter the last one
Didnt I go on my knees to ye to ask ye to drop it and lead a good
life and didnt ye tell me yed never do the like again And the poor
innocent children too I wonder yeve the heart to do it

It came into my head now to wonder why the sergeant and two policemen
had come down from Bargo very early in the morning about three months
ago and asked father to show them the beef in his cask and the hide
belonging to it I wondered at the time the beast was killed why father
made the hide into a rope and before he did that had cut out the brand
and dropped it into a hot fire The police saw a hide with our brand on
all rightkilled about a fortnight They didnt know it had been taken
off a cancered bullock and that father took the trouble to stick him
and bleed him before he took the hide off so as it shouldnt look dark
Father certainly knew most things in the way of working on the cross
I can see now hed have made his money a deal easier and no trouble of
mind if hed only chosen to go straight

When mother said this father looked at her for a bit as if he was sorry
for it then he straightened himself up and an ugly look came into his
face as he growled out

You mind your own business we must live as well as other people
Theres squatters here that does as bad Theyre just like the squires
at home think a poor man hasnt a right to live You bring the brand
and look alive Dick or Ill sharpen ye up a bit

The brand was in the corner but mother got between me and it and
stretched out her hand to father as if to stop me and him

In Gods name she cried out arent ye satisfied with losing your
own soul and bringing disgrace upon your family but ye must be the ruin
of your innocent children Dont touch the brand Dick

But father wasnt a man to be crossed and what made it worse he had
a couple of glasses of bad grog in him There was an old villain of a
shantykeeper that lived on a back creek Hed been there as he came
by and had a glass or two He had a regular savage temper father had
though he was quiet enough and not bad to us when he was right But the
grog always spoiled him

He gave poor mother a shove which sent her reeling against the wall
where she fell down and hit her head against the stool and lay there
Aileen sitting down in the corner turned white and began to cry
while father catches me a box on the ear which sends me kicking picks
up the brand out of the corner and walks out with me after him

I think if Id been another year or so older Id have struck backI
felt that savage about poor mother that I could have gone at him
myselfbut we had been too long used to do everything he told us and
somehow even if a chaps fathers a bad one he dont seem like other
men to him So as Jim had lighted the fire we branded the little red
heifer calf firsta fine fat sixmonthsold nugget she wasand then
three bull calves all strangers and then Pollys calf I suppose just
for a blind Jim and I knew the four calves were all strangers but we
didnt know the brands of the mothers they all seemed different

After this all was made right to kill a beast The gallows was ready
rigged in a corner of the yard father brought his gun and shot the
yellow steer The calves were put into our calfpenPollys and
alland all the cows turned out to go where they liked

We helped father to skin and hang up the beast and pretty late it was
when we finished Mother had laid us out our tea and gone to bed with
Aileen We had ours and then went to bed Father sat outside and smoked
in the starlight Hours after I woke up and heard mother crying Before
daylight we were up again and the steer was cut up and salted and in
the harnesscask soon after sunrise His head and feet were all popped
into a big pot where we used to make soup for the pigs and by the time
it had been boiling an hour or two there was no fear of any one swearing
to the yellow steer by headmark

We had a hearty breakfast off the skirt but mother wouldnt touch a
bit nor let Aileen take any she took nothing but a bit of bread and
a cup of tea and sat there looking miserable and downcast Father said
nothing but sat very darklooking and ate his food as if nothing was
the matter After breakfast he took his mare the old dog followed
there was no need to whistle for himits my belief he knew more than
many a Christianand away they went Father didnt come home for
a weekhe had got into the habit of staying away for days and days
together Then things went on the old way




Chapter 3



So the years went onslow enough they seemed to us sometimesthe green
winters pretty cold I tell you with frost and hailstorms and the
long hot summers We were not called boys any longer except by mother
and Aileen but took our places among the men of the district We lived
mostly at home in the old way sometimes working pretty hard sometimes
doing very little When the cows were milked and the wood chopped there
was nothing to do for the rest of the day The creek was that close that
mother used to go and dip the bucket into it herself when she wanted
one from a little wooden step above the clear reedy waterhole

Now and then we used to dig in the garden There was reaping and
cornpulling and husking for part of the year but often for weeks at
a time there was next to nothing to do No hunting worth muchwe were
sick of kangarooing like the dogs themselves that as they grew old
would run a little way and then pull up if a mob came jump jump past
them No shooting except a few ducks and pigeons Father used to laugh
at the shooting in this country and say theyd never have poachers
herethe game wasnt worth it No fishing except an odd codfish in
the deepest waterholes and you might sit half a day without a bite

Now this was very bad for us boys Lads want plenty of work and a
little play now and then to keep them straight If theres none theyll
make it and you cant tell how far theyll go when they once start

Well Jim and I used to get our horses and ride off quietly in the
afternoon as if we were going after cattle but in reality as soon
as we were out of sight of mother to ride over to that old villain
Grimes the shantykeeper where we met the young Dalys and others of
the same sorttalked a good deal of nonsense and gossip what was worse
played at allfours and euchre which we had learned from an American
harvest hand at one of the large farms

Besides playing for money which put us rather into trouble sometimes
as we couldnt always find a halfcrown if we lost it we learned
another bad habit and that was to drink spirits What burning nasty
stuff I thought it at first and so did we all But every one wanted to
be thought a man and up to all kinds of wickedness so we used to make
it a point of drinking our nobbler and sometimes treating the others
twice if we had cash

There was another family that lived a couple of miles off higher up the
creek and we had always been good friends with them though they
never came to our house and only we boys went to theirs They were the
parents of the little girl that went to school with us and a boy who
was a year older than me

Their father had been a gardener at home and he married a native girl
who was born somewhere about the Hawkesbury near Windsor Her father
had been a farmer and many a time she told us how sorry she was to go
away from the old place and what fine corn and pumpkins they grew and
how they had a church at Windsor and used to take their hay and fruit
and potatoes to Sydney and what a grand place Sydney was with stone
buildings called markets for people to sell fruit and vegetables and
poultry in and how you could walk down into Lower George Street and see
Sydney Harbour a great shining saltwater plain a thousand times as
big as the biggest waterhole with ships and boats and sailors and
every kind of strange thing upon it

Mrs Storefield was pretty fond of talking and she was always fond of
me because once when she was out after the cows and her man was away
and she had left Grace at home the little thing crawled down to the
waterhole and tumbled in I happened to be riding up with a message for
mother to borrow some soap when I heard a little cry like a lambs
and there was poor little Gracey struggling in the water like a drowning
kitten with her face under Another minute or two would have finished
her but I was off the old pony and into the water like a teal flapper
I had her out in a second or two and she gasped and cried a bit but
soon came to and when Mrs Storefield came home she first cried over
her as if she would break her heart and kissed her and then she kissed
me and said Now Dick Marston you look here Your mothers a good
woman though simple your father I dont like and I hear many stories
about him that makes me think the less we ought to see of the lot of
you the better But youve saved my childs life today and Ill be a
friend and a mother to you as long as I live even if you turn out bad
and Im rather afraid you willyou and Jim bothbut it wont be my
fault for want of trying to keep you straight and John and I will
be your kind and loving friends as long as we live no matter what
happens

After thatit was strange enoughbut I always took to the little
toddling thing that Id pulled out of the water I wasnt very big
myself if it comes to that and she seemed to have a feeling about it
for shed come to me every time I went there and sit on my knee and
look at me with her big brown serious eyesthey were just the same
after she grew upand talk to me in her little childish lingo I
believe she knew all about it for she used to say Dick pull Gracey
out of water and then shed throw her arms round my neck and kiss me
and walk off to her mother If Id let her drown then and tied a stone
round my neck and dropped through the reeds to the bottom of the big
waterhole it would have been better for both of us

When John came home he was nearly as bad as the old woman and wanted to
give me a filly but I wouldnt have it boy as I was I never cared for
money nor moneys worth and I was not going to be paid for picking a
kid out of the water

George Storefield Graceys brother was about my own age He thought a
lot of what Id done for her and years afterwards I threatened to punch
his head if he said anything more about it He laughed and held out his
hand

You and I might have been better friends lately says he but dont
you forget youve got another brother besides Jimone that will stick
to you too fair weather or foul

I always had a great belief in George though we didnt get on over
well and often had fallings out He was too steady and hardworking
altogether for Jim and me He worked all day and every day and saved
every penny he made Catch him gaffingno not for a sixpence He
called the Dalys and Jacksons thieves and swindlers who would be locked
up or even hanged some day unless they mended themselves As for
drinking a glass of grog you might just as soon ask him to take a
little laudanum or arsenic

Why should I drink grog he used to saysuch stuff too as you
get at that old villain Grimesswith a good appetite and a good
conscience Im afraid of no man the police may come and live on my
ground for what I care I work all day have a read in the evening and
sleep like a top when I turn in What do I want more

Oh but you never see any life Jim said youre just like an old
working bullock that walks up to the yoke in the morning and never stops
hauling till hes let go at night This is a free country and I dont
think a fellow was born for that kind of thing and nothing else

This countrys like any other country Jim George would say holding
up his head and looking straight at him with his steady gray eyes a
man must work and save when hes young if he dont want to be a beggar
or a slave when hes old I believe in a man enjoying himself as well as
you do but my notion of that is to have a good farm well stocked and
paid for by and by and then to take it easy perhaps when my back is a
little stiffer than it is now

But a man must have a little fun when he is young I said Whats the
use of having money when youre old and rusty and cant take pleasure
in anything

A man neednt be so very old at forty he says then and twenty
years steady work will put all of us youngsters well up the ladder
Besides I dont call it fun getting halfdrunk with a lot of
blackguards at a low pothouse or a shanty listening to the stupid
talk and boasting lies of a pack of loafers and worse Theyre fit for
nothing better but you and Jim are Now look here Ive got a small
contract from Mr Andrews for a lot of fencing stuff It will pay us
wages and something over If you like to go in with me well go share
and share I know what hands you both are at splitting and fencing What
do you say

Jim poor Jim was inclined to take Georges offer He was that
goodhearted that a kind word would turn him any time But I was put out
at his laying it down so about the Dalys and us shantying and gaffing
and I do think now that some folks are born so as they cant do without
a taste of some sort of fun once in a way I cant put it out clear but
it ought to be fixed somehow for us chaps that havent got the gift of
working all day and every day but can do two days work in one when
we like that we should have our allowance of reasonable fun and
pleasurethat is what we called pleasure not what somebody thinks we
ought to take pleasure in Anyway I turned on George rather rough and
I says Were not good enough for the likes of you Mr Storefield
Its very kind of you to think of us but well take our own line and
you take yours

Im sorry for it Dick and more sorry that you take huff at an
old friend All I want is to do you good and act a friends part
Goodbyesome day youll see it

Youre hard on George says Jim theres no pleasing you today one
would think there were lots of chaps fighting how to give us a lift
Goodbye George old man Im sorry we cant wire in with you wed
soon knock out those posts and rails on the ironbark range

Youd better stop Jim and take a hand in the deal says I or
rather the devil for I believe he gets inside a chap at times and
then you and George can take a turn at localpreaching when youre cut
out Im off So without another word I jumped on to my horse and went
off down the hill across the creek and over the boulders the other
side without much caring where I was going The fact was I felt I had
acted meanly in sneering at a man who only said what he did for my good
and I wasnt at all sure that I hadnt made a breach between Gracey and
myself and though I had such a temper when it was roused that all the
world wouldnt have stopped me every time I thought of not seeing that
girl again made my heart ache as if it would burst

I was nearly home before I heard the clatter of a horses feet and Jim
rode up alongside of me He was just the same as ever with a smile on
his face You didnt often see it without one

I knew he had come after me and had given up his own fancy for mine

I thought you were going to stay and turn good I said Why didnt
you

It might have been better for me if I had he said but you know very
well Dick that whatever turns up whether its for good or evil you
and I go together

We looked at one another for a moment Our eyes met We didnt say
anything but we understood one another as well as if we had talked for
a week We rode up to the door of our cottage without speaking The sun
had set and some of the stars had come out early as it was for it
was late autumn Aileen was sitting on a bench in the verandah reading
mother was working away as usual at something in the house Mother
couldnt read or write but you never caught her sitting with her hands
before her Except when she was asleep I dont think she ever was quite
still

Aileen ran out to us and stood while we let go our horses and brought
the saddles and bridles under the verandah

Im glad youre come home for one thing she said There is a message
from father He wants you to meet him

Who brought it I said

One of the DalysPatsey I think

All right said Jim kissing her as he lifted her up in his great
strong arms I must go in and have a gossip with the old woman Aileen
can tell me after tea I daresay its not so good that it wont keep

Mother was that fond of both of us that I believe as sure as I sit
here shed have put her head on the block or died in any other way for
either of her boys not because it was her duty but glad and cheerful
like to have saved us from death or disgrace I think she was fonder
of us two than she was of Aileen Mothers are generally fonder of their
sons Why I never could see and if she thought more of one than the
other it was Jim He was the youngest and he had that kind of
big frolicsome loving way with him like a Newfoundland pup about
halfgrown I always used to think somehow nobody ever seemed to be
able to get into a pelter with Jim not even father and that was a
thing as some people couldnt be got to believe As for mother and
Aileen they were as fond of him as if hed been a big baby

So while he went to sit down on the stretcher and let mother put her
arms round his neck and hug him and cry over him as she always did if
hed been away more than a day or two I took a walk down the creek with
Aileen in the starlight to hear all about this message from father
Besides I could see that she was very serious over it and I thought
there might be something in it more than common

First of all did you make any agreement with George Storefield she
said

No why should I Has he been talking to you about me What right has
he to meddle with my business

Oh Dick dont talk like that Anything that he said was only to do
you a kindness and Jim

Hang him and his kindness too I said Let him keep it for those
that want it But what did he tell you

He said first of all answered poor Aileen with the tears in her
eyes and trying to take hold of my hand that he had a contract for
fencing timber which he had taken at good prices which he would share
with you and Jim that he knew you two and himself could finish it in a
few weeks and that he expected to get the contract for the timber for
the new bridge at Dargo which he would let you go shares in too He
didnt like to speak about that because it wasnt certain but he had
calculated all the quantities and prices and he was sure you would make
70 or 80 Pounds each before Christmas Now was there any harm in that
and dont you think it was very good of him to think of it

Well hes not a bad fellow old George I said but hes a little
too fond of interfering with other peoples business Jim and I are
quite able to manage our own affairs as I told him this evening when I
refused to have anything to do with his fencing arrangement

Oh Dick did you she said What a pity I made sure Jim would have
liked it so for only last week he said he was sick and tired of having
nothing to dothat he should soon lose all his knack at using tools
that he used to be so proud of Didnt he say hed like to join George

He would I daresay and I told him to do as he liked I came away
by myself and only saw him just before we crossed the range Hes big
enough and old enough to take his own line

But you know he thinks so much of you she groaned out that hed
follow you to destruction That will be the end of it depend upon it
Dick I tell you so now youve taken to bad ways youll have his blood
on your head yet

Jims old enough and big enough to take care of himself I said
sulkily If he likes to come my way I wont hinder him I wont try to
persuade him one way or the other Let him take his own line I dont
believe in preaching and old womens talk Let a man act and think for
himself

Youll break my heart and poor mothers too said Aileen suddenly
taking both my hands in hers What has she done but love us ever since
we were born and what does she live for You know she has no pleasure
of any kind you know shes afraid every morning she wakes that the
police will get father for some of his cross doings and now you and Jim
are going the same wild way and what everwhat ever will be the end of
it

Here she let go my hands and sobbed and cried as if she was a child
again much as I remember her doing one day when my kangaroo dog killed
her favourite cat And Aileen was a girl that didnt cry much generally
and never about anything that happened to herself it was always about
somebody else and their misfortunes She was a quiet girl too very
determined and not much given to talking about what she was going to
do but when she made up her mind she was sure to stick to it I used to
think she was more like father than any of us She had his coloured hair
and eyes and his way of standing and looking as if the whole world
wouldnt shift him But shed mothers soft heart for all that and I
took the more notice of her crying and whimpering this time because it
was so strange for her

If any one could have seen straight into my heart just then I was
regularly knocked over and had two minds to go inside to Jim and tell
him wed take Georges splitting job and start to tackle it first thing
tomorrow morning but just then one of those confounded nighthawks
flitted on a dead tree before us and began his hooho as if it was
laughing at me I can see the place nowthe mountain black and dismal
the moon low and strangelooking the little waterhole glittering in the
halflight and this dark bird hooting away in the night An odd feeling
seemed to come over my mind and if it had been the devil himself
standing on the dead limb it could not have had a worse effect on me as
I stopped there uncertain whether to turn to the right or the left

We dont often know in this world sometimes whether we are turning off
along a road where we shall never come back from or whether we can go
just a little way and look at the faroff hills and new rivers and come
home safe

I remember the whole lot of badmeaning thoughts coming with a rush
over my heart and I laughed at myself for being so soft as to choose
a hardworking pokey kind of life at the word of a slow fellow like
George when I might be riding about the country on a fine horse eating
and drinking of the best and only doing what people said half the old
settlers had made their money by

Poor Aileen told me afterwards that if shed thought for a moment I
could be turned shed have gone down on her knees and never got up till
I promised to keep straight and begin to work at honest daily labour
like a manlike a man who hoped to end his days in a good house on a
good farm with a good wife and nice children round him and not in a
prison cell Some people would call the first after years of honest
work and being always able to look every one in the face being more
of a man than the other But people have different ways and different
ideas

Come Ailie I said are you going to whine and cry all night I
shall be afraid to come home if youre going to be like this Whats the
message from father

She wiped away her tears and putting her hand on my shoulder looked
steadily into my face

Poor boypoor dear Dick she said I feel as if I should see that
fresh face of yours looking very different some day or other Something
tells me that theres bad luck before you But never mind youll never
lose your sister if the lucks ever so bad Father sent word you and Jim
were to meet him at Broken Creek and bring your whips with you

What in the worlds that for I said half speaking to myself It
looks as if there was a big mob to drive and wheres he to get a big
mob there in that mountainous beastly place where the cattle all bolt
like wallabies and where I never saw twenty head together

Hes got some reason for it said Aileen sorrowfully If I were you
I wouldnt go Its no good and fathers trying now to drag you and Jim
into the bad ways hes been following these years

How do you know its so bad said I How can a girl like you know

I know very well she said Do you think Ive lived here all these
years and dont know things What makes him always come home after dark
and be that nervous every time he sees a stranger coming up youd think
he was come out of gaol Why has he always got money and why does
mother look so miserable when hes at home and cheer up when he goes
away

He may get jobs of droving or something I said You have no right
to say that hes robbing or something of that sort because he doesnt
care about tying himself to mothers apronstring

Aileen laughed but it was more like crying

You told me just now she saidoh so sorrowfullythat you and Jim
were old enough to take a line of your own Why dont you do it now

And tell father well have nothing more to do with him

Why not she said standing up straight before me and facing me just
as I saw father face the big bullockdriver before he knocked him down
Why not You need never ask him for another meal you can earn an easy
living in halfadozen ways you and Jim Why should you let him spoil
your life and ruin your soul for evermore

The priest put that into your head I said sneeringly Father
Doyleof course he knows what theyll do with a fellow after hes
dead

No she said Father Doyle never said a word about you that wasnt
good and kind He says mothers a good Catholic and he takes an
interest in you boys and me because of her

He can persuade you women to do anything I said not that I had any
grudge against poor old Father Doyle who used to come riding up the
rough mountain track on his white horse and tiring his old bones
just to look after his flock as he saidand nice lambs some of them
werebut I wanted to tease her and make her break off with this fancy
of hers

He never does and couldnt persuade me except for my good said she
getting more and more roused and her black eyes glowed again and Ill
tell you what Ill do to prove it Its a sin but if it is Ill stand
by it and now Ill swear it here she knelt down as Almighty God
shall help me at the last day if you and Jim will promise me to start
straight off up the country and take bushwork till shearing comes on
and never to have any truck with cross chaps and their ways Ill turn
Protestant Ill go to church with you and keep to it till I die

Wasnt she a trump Ive known women that would give up a lot for a man
they were sweet on and wives that would follow their husbands about
like spaniels and women that would lie and deceive and all but rob and
murder for men they were fond of and sometimes do nearly as much to
spite other women But I dont think I ever knew a woman that would
give up her religion for any one before and its not as if she
wasnt staunch to her own faith She was as regular in her prayers and
crossings and beads and all the rest of it as mother herself and if
there ever was a good girl in the whole world she was one She turned
faint as she said this and I thought she was going to drop down If
anything could have turned me then it would have been this It was
almost like giving her life for ours and I dont think shed have
valued hers two straws if she could have saved us Theres a great
deal said about different kinds of love in this world but I cant
help thinking that the love between brothers and sisters that have been
brought up together and have had very few other people to care about
is a higher better sort than any other in the world Theres less
selfishness about itno thought but for the others good If that
can be made safe death and pain and poverty and misery are all little
things And wasnt I fond of Aileen in spite of all my hardness and
crossgrained obstinacyso fond that I was just going to hug her to me
and say Take it all your own way Ailie dear when Jim came tearing
out of the hut bareheaded and stood listening to a faroff sound that
caught all our ears at once We made out the source of it too wellfar
too well

What was the noise at that hour of the night

It was a hollow faint distant roaring that gradually kept getting
louder It was the strange mournful bellowing that comes from a drove
of cattle forced along an unknown track As we listened the sound came
clearly on the night wind faint yet still clearly coming nearer

Cattle being driven Jim cried out and a big mob too Its
fatherfor a note Lets get our horses and meet him




Chapter 4



All right said I he must have got there a day before his time It
is a big mob and no mistake I wonder where theyre taking them to
Aileen shrugged her shoulders and walked in to mother with a look of
misery and despair on her face such as I never saw there before

She knew it was no use talking to me now The idea of going out to meet
a large lot of unknown cattle had strongly excited us as would have
been the case with every bushbred lad All sorts of wonders passed
through our minds as we walked down the creek bank with our bridles in
our hands towards where our horses usually fed One was easy to catch
the other with a little management was secured In ten minutes we were
riding fast through the dark trees and fallen timber towards the wild
gullies and rockstrewed hills of Broken Creek

It was not more than an hour when we got up to the cattle We could hear
them a good while before we saw them My word said Jim aint they
restless They cant have come far or they wouldnt roar so Where can
the old man have touched for them

How should I know I said roughly I had a kind of idea but I thought
he would never be so rash

When we got up I could see the cattle had been rounded up in a flat with
stony ridges all round There must have been three or four hundred of
them only a man and a boy riding round and wheeling them every now and
then Their horses were pretty well knocked up I knew father at once
and the old chestnut mare he used to ridean animal with legs like
timbers and a mule rump but you couldnt tire her and no beast that
ever was calved could get away from her The boy was a halfcaste that
father had picked up somewhere he was as good as two men any day

So youve come at last growled father and a good thing too I
didnt expect to be here till tomorrow morning The dog came home I
supposethats what brought you here wasnt it I thought the infernal
cattle would beat Warrigal and me and wed have all our trouble for
nothing

Whose cattle are they and what are you going to do with them

Never you mind ask no questions and youll see all about it
tomorrow Ill go and take a snooze now Ive had no sleep for three
nights

With our fresh horses and riding round so we kept the cattle easily
enough We did not tell Warrigal he might go to rest not thinking a
halfcaste brat like him wanted any He didnt say anything but went to
sleep on his horse which walked in and out among the angry cattle as he
sat on the saddle with his head down on the horses neck They sniffed
at him once or twice some of the old cows but none of them horned him
and daylight came rather quicker than one would think

Then we saw whose cattle they were they had all Hunters and Falklands
brands on which showed that they belonged to Banda and Elingamah
stations

By George says Jim theyre Mr Hunters cattle and all these
circle dots belong to Banda What a mob of calves not one of them
branded What in the world does father intend to do with them

Father was up and came over where we stood with our horses in our hands
before we had time to say more He wasnt one of those that slept after
daylight whether he had work to do or not He certainly COULD work
daylight or dark wet or dry cold or hot it was all one to father It
seems a pity what he did was no use to him as it turned out for he was
a man was old dad every inch of him

Now boys he said quite brisk and almost goodnatured for him look
alive and well start the cattle weve been long enough here let em
head up that gully and Ill show you something youve never seen before
for as long as youve known Broken Creek Ranges

But where are you going to take em to I said Theyre all Mr
Hunters and Mr Falklands the brands are plain enough

Are the calves branded you blasted fool he said while the black
look came over his face that had so often frightened me when I was a
child You do what I tell you if youve any pluck and gumption about
you or else you and your brother can ride over to Dargo Police Station
and give me away if you like only dont come home again I warn you
sons or no sons

If I had done what I had two minds to dofor I wasnt afraid of him
then savage as he lookedtold him to do his own duffing and ridden
away with Jim there and thenpoor Jim who sat on his horse staring at
both of us and saying nothinghow much better it would have been for
all of us the old man as well as ourselves but it seemed as if it
wasnt to be Partly from use and partly from a love of danger and
something new which is at the bottom of half the crime in the bush
districts I turned my horses head after the cattle which were now
beginning to straggle Jim did the same on his side How easy is it for
chaps to take the road to hell for that was about the size of it and
we were soon too busy to think about much else

The track we were driving on led along a narrow rocky gully which looked
as if it had been split up or made out of a crack in the earth thousands
of years ago by an earthquake or something of that kind The hills were
that steep that every now and then some of the young cattle that were
not used to that sort of country would come sliding down and bellow as
if they thought they were going to break their necks

The water rushed down it like a torrent in wet winters and formed a
sort of creek and the bed of it made what track there was There were
overhanging rocks and places that made you giddy to look at and some
of these must have fallen down and blocked up the creek at one time or
other We had to scramble round them the best way we could

When we got nearly up to the head of the gullyand great work it was
to force the footsore cattle along as we couldnt use our whips
overmuchJim called out

Why here comes old Crib Whod have thought hed have seen the track
Well done old man Now were right

Father never took any notice of the poor brute as he came limping along
the stones Woman or child horse or dog its the same old thingthe
more any creature loves a man in this world the worse theyre treated
It looks like it at any rate I saw how it was father had given Crib
a cruel beating the night before when he was put out for some trifling
matter and the dog had left him and run home But now he had thought
better of it and seen our tracks and come to work and slave with his
bleeding feetfor they were cut all to piecesand got the whip across
his back now and then for his pains Its a queer world

When we got right to the top of this confounded gully nearly deadbeat
all of us and only for the dog heeling them up every now and then and
making his teeth nearly meet in them without a whimper I believe the
cattle would have charged back and beat us There was a sort of rough
tablelandscrubby and stony and thick it was but still the grass
wasnt bad in summer when the country below was all dried up There
were wild horses in troops there and a few wild cattle so Jim and I
knew the place well but it was too far and too much of a journey for
our own horses to go often

Do you see that sugarloaf hill with the bald top across the range
said father riding up just then as we were taking it easy a little
Dont let the cattle straggle and make straight for that

Why its miles away said Jim looking rather dismal We could never
get em there

Were not going there stupid says father thats only the line to
keep Ill show you something about dinnertime thatll open your eyes a
bit

Poor Jim brightened up at the mention of dinnertime for boylike he
was getting very hungry and as he wasnt done growing he had no end of
an appetite I was hungry enough for the matter of that but I wouldnt
own to it

Well we shall come to somewhere I suppose says Jim when father was
gone Blest if I didnt think he was going to keep us wandering in
this blessed Nulla Mountain all day I wish Id never seen the blessed
cattle I was only waiting for you to hook it when we first seen the
brands by daylight and Id ha been off like a brindle Mickey down a
range

Better for us if we had I said but its too late now We must stick
to it I suppose

We had kept the cattle going for three or four miles through the
thickest of the country every now and then steering our course by the
clear round top of Sugarloaf that could be seen for miles round
but never seemed to get any nearer when we came on a rough sort of
logfence which ran the way we were going

I didnt think there were any farms up here I said to Jim

Its a break he said almost in a whisper Theres a
duffingyard somewhere handy thats whats the matter

Keep the cattle along it anyway Well soon see what it leads to

The cattle ran along the fence as if they expected to get to the end of
their troubles soon The scrub was terribly thick in places and every
now and then there was a break in the fence when one of us had to go
outside and hunt them until we came to the next bit At last we came to
a little open kind of flat with the scrub that thick round it as you
couldnt hardly ride through it and just as Jim said there was the
yard

It was a duffingyard sure enough No one but people who had cattle to
hide and young stock they didnt want other people to see branded would
have made a place there

Just on the south side of the yard which was built of great heavy
stringybark trees cut down in the line of the fence and made up with
limbs and logs the range went up as steep as the side of a house The
cattle were that tired and footsorehalf their feet were bleeding poor
devilsthat they ran in through the sliprails and began to lay down

Light a fire one of you boys says father putting up the heavy
sliprails and fastening them We must brand these calves before dark
One of you can go to that gunyah just under the range where that big
white rock is and youll find tea and sugar and something to eat

Jim rushed off at once while I sulkily began to put some bark and twigs
together and build a fire

Whats the use of all this cross work I said to father were bound
to be caught some day if we keep on at it Then therell be no one left
to take care of mother and Aileen

He looked rather struck at this and then said quietly

You and your brother can go back now Never say I kept you against your
will You may as well lend a hand to brand these calves then you may
clear out as soon as you like

Well I didnt quite like leaving the old chap in the middle of the work
like that I remember thinking like many another young fool I suppose
that I could draw back in time just after Id tackled this job

Draw back indeed When does a man ever get the chance of doing that
once hes regularly gone in for any of the devils work and wages He
takes care there isnt much drawing back afterwards So I said

We may as well give you a hand with this lot but well go home then
and drop all this duffing work It dont pay Im old enough to know
that and youll find it out yet I expect father yourself

The fox lives long and gives the hounds many a long chase before hes
run into he said with a grim chuckle I swore Id be revenged on em
all when they locked me up and sent me out here for a paltry hare broke
my old mothers heart so it did Ive had a pound for every hair in
her skin and I shall go on till I die After all if a man goes to work
cautious and runs mute its not so easy to catch him in this country at
any rate

Jim at this came running out of the cave with a face of joy a bag of
shipbiscuit and a lot of other things

Heres tea and sugar he said and theres biscuits and jam and a
big lump of cheese Get the fire right Dick while I get some water
Well soon have some tea and these biscuits are jolly

The tea was made and we all had a good meal Father found a bottle of
rum too he took a good drink himself and gave Jim and me a sip each
I felt less inclined to quarrel with father after that So we drafted
all the calves into a small penyard and began to put our brand on them
as quick as we could catch em

A hundred and sixty of em altogetherall ages from a month old to
nearly a year Fine strong calves and in rare condition too We could
see they were all belonging to Mr Hunter and Mr Falkland How they
came to leave them all so long unbranded I cant say Very careless
they often are on these large cattlestations so that sharp people like
father and the Dalys and a lot more get an easy chance at them

Whatever father was going to do with them all when he had branded em
we couldnt make out

Theres no place to tail or wean em whispered Jim Were not above
thirty miles from Banda in a straight line These cows are dead sure to
make straight back the very minute theyre let out and very nice work
itll look with all these calves with our brand on sucking these cows

Father happened to come round for a hot brand just as Jim finished

Never you mind about the weaning he snarled I shant ask you to
tail them either It wouldnt be a nice job here would it and father
actually laughed It wasnt a very gay kind of a laugh and he shut up
his mouth with a sort of snap again Jim and I hadnt seen him laugh for
I dont know how long and it almost frightened us

As Jim said it wouldnt do to let the cattle out again If calves are
weaned and have only one brand on it is very hard for any man to swear
that they are not the property of the man to whom that brand belongs
He may believe them to be his but may never have seen them in his life
and if he has seen them on a camp or on the run its very hard to swear
to any one particular red or spotted calf as you would to a horse

The great dart is to keep the young stock away from their mothers until
they forget one another and then most of the danger is past But if
calves with one mans brand on are seen sucking another mans cows it
is pretty plain that the brand on the calves has been put on without the
consent of the owner of the cowswhich is cattlestealing a felony
according to the Act 7 and 8 George IV No 29 punishable with three
years imprisonment with hard labour on the roads of the colony or
other place as the Judge may direct

Theres a lot of law How did I learn it I had plenty of time in
Berrima Gaolworse luckmy first stretch But it was after Id done
the foolishness and not before




Chapter 5



Now then you boys says father coming up all of a sudden like and
bringing out his words as if it was old times with us when we didnt
know whether hed hit first and talk afterwards or the other way on
get out the lot weve just branded and drive em straight for that
peak where the water shines dripping over the stones right again the
sun and look slippy were burning daylight and these cows are making
row enough blast em to be heard all the way to Banda Ill go on and
steady the lead you keep em close up to me

Father mounted the old mare The dog stopped behind he knew hed
have to mind the tailthat is the hindmost cattleand stop em from
breaking or running clear away from the others We threw down the rails
Away the cattle rushed out all in a long string Youd a thought no
mortal men could a kept em in that blind hole of a place But father
headed em and turned em towards the peak The dog worried those that
wanted to stay by the yard or turn another way We dropped our whip on
em and kept em going In five minutes they were all amoving along
in one mob at a pretty sharpish trot like a lot of store cattle Father
knew his way about whether the country was thick or open It was all as
one to him What a slashing stockman he would have made in new country
if he only could have kept straight

It took us an hours hard dinkum to get near the peak Sometimes it was
awful rocky as well as scrubby and the poor devils of cattle got as
sorefooted as babiesblood up to the knee some of em but we crowded
em on there was no help for it

At last we rounded up on a flat rocky open kind of a place and here
father held up his hand

Let em ring a bit some of their tongues are out These young things
is generally soft Come here Dick I rode up and he told me to follow
him

We walked our horses up to the edge of the mountain and looked over It
was like the end of the world Far down there was a dark dreadful drop
into a sort of deep valley below You couldnt see the bottom of it
The trees on the mountain side looked like bushes and they were big
ironbarks and messmates too On three sides of us was this awful
desolatelooking precipicea dreary gloomy Godforsaken kind of spot
The sky got cloudy and the breeze turned cold and began to murmur
and whistle in an odd unnatural kind of way while father seeing how
scared and puzzled I was began to laugh I shuddered A thought crossed
my mind that it might be the Enemy of Souls in his shape going to
carry us off for doing such a piece of wickedness

Looks queer doesnt it says father going to the brink and kicking
down a boulder that rolled and crashed down the steep mountain side
tearing its way through scrub and heath till it settled down in the glen
below It wont do for a mans horse to slip will it boy And yet
theres a track here into a fine large paddock open and clear too
where Im going to put these cattle into

I stared at him without speaking thinking was he mad

No the old man isnt mad youngster he said not yet at least Im
going to show you a trick that none of you native boys are up to smart
as you think yourselves Here he got off the old mare and began to
lead her to the edge of the mountain

Now you rally the cattle well after me he said theyll follow the
old mare after a bit I left a few cows among em on purpose and when
they draw keep em going well up but not too fast

He had lengthened the bridle of the mare and tied the end of a light
tether rope that he had round her neck to it I saw her follow him
slowly and turn down a rocky track that seemed to lead straight over a
bluff of the precipice

However I gave the word to head on The dog had started rounding em
up as soon as he saw the old mare walk towards the mountain side and
the cattle were soon crushed up pretty close to the mares heels

Mind this that they were so footsore and tender about the hoofs that
they could not have run away from us on foot if they had tried

After ringing a bit one of the quiet cows followed up the old mare
that was walking step by step forward and all the rest followed her
like sheep Cattle will do that Ive seen a stockrider when all the
horses were dead beat trying to get fat cattle to take a river in
flood jump off and turn his horse loose into the stream If he went
straight and swam across all the cattle would follow him like sheep

Well when the old mare got to the bluff she turned short round to the
right and then I saw that she had struck a narrow path down a gully
that got deeper and deeper every yard we went There was just room for
a couple or three calves to go abreast and by and by all of em was
walking down it like as if they was the beasts agoing into Noahs Ark
It wound and wound and got deeper and deeper till the walls of rock were
ever so far above our heads Our work was done then the cattle had to
walk on like sheep in a race We led our horses behind them and the dog
walked along saving his sore feet as well as he could and never tried
to bite a beast once he got within the walls He looked quite satisfied
and kept chuckling almost to himself I really believe Ive seen dogs
laugh Once upon a time Ive read of theyd have taken poor Crib for a
familiar spirit and hanged or burnt him Well he knew a lot and no
mistake Ive seen plenty of Christians as he could buy and sell and no
trouble to him Im dashed if the old mare too didnt take a pleasure
in working cattle on the cross She was the laziest old wretch bringing
up the cows at home or running in the horses Many a time Jim and I
took a turn out of her when father didnt know But put her after a
big mob of cattleshe must have known they couldnt be oursand shed
clatter down a range like the wall of a house and bite and kick the
tail cattle if they didnt get out of her way They say dogs and horses
are all honest and its only us as teaches em to do wrong My notions
theyre a deal like ourselves and some of em fancies the square racket
dull and safe while some takes a deal kindlier to the other Anyhow no
cattleduffer in the colonies could have had a better pair of mates than
old Sally and Crib if the devil himself had broken em in special for
the trade

It was childs play now as far as the driving went Jim and I walked
along leading our horses and yarning away as we used to do when we were
little chaps bringing in the milkers

My word Dick dads dropped into a fine road through this thundering
mountain hasnt he I wonder where it leads to How high the rockwalls
are getting above us he says I know now I think I heard long ago
from one of the Crosbies of a place in the ranges down towards behind
the Nulla Mountain Terrible Hollow He didnt know about it himself
but said an old stockman told him about it when he was drunk He said
the Government men used to hide the cattle and horses there in old
times and that it was never found out

Why wasnt it found out Jim If the old fellow split about it some
one else would get to know

Well old Dan said that they killed one man that talked of telling the
rest were too frightened after that and they all swore a big oath never
to tell any one except he was on the cross

Thats how dad come to know I suppose said Jim I wish he never
had I dont care about those cross doings I never did I never seen
any good come out of them yet

Well we must go through with it now I suppose It wont do to leave
old dad in the lurch You wont will you Jim

You know very well I wont says Jim very soberlike I dont like
it any the more for that But I wish father had broke his leg and was
lying up at home with mother nursing him before he found out this
hellhole of a place

Well were going to get out of it and soon too The gully seems
getting wider and I can see a bit of open country through the trees

Thank God for that says Jim My bootsll part company soon and the
poor devils of calves wont have any hoofs either if theres much more
of this

Theyre drawing faster now The leading cattle are beginning to run
Were at the end of the drive

So it was The deep rocky gully gradually widened into an open and
pretty smooth flat this again into a splendid little plain up to
the knees in grass a big natural park closed round on every side with
sandstone rockwalls as upright as if they were built and a couple of
thousand feet above the place where we stood

This scrub country was crossed by two good creeks it was several miles
across and a trifle more in length Our hungry weaners spread out and
began to feed without a notion of their mothers theyd left behind but
they were not the only ones there We could see other mobs of cattle
some near some farther off horses too and the wellworn track in
several ways showed that this was no new grazing ground

Father came riding back quite comfortable and heartylike for him

Welcome to Terrible Hollow lads says he Youre the youngest chaps
it has ever been shown to and if I didnt know you were the right
stuff youd never have seen it though youre my own flesh and blood
Jump off and let your horses go They cant get away even if they
tried they dont look much like that

Our poor nags were something like the cattle pretty hungry and stiff
They put their heads down to the thick green grass and went in at it
with a will

Bring your saddles along with you father said and come after me
Ill show you a good camping place You deserve a treat after last
nights work

We turned back towards the rocky wall near to where we had come in and
there behind a bush and a big piece of sandstone that had fallen
down was the entrance to a cave The walls of it were quite clean and
whitelooking the floor was smooth and the roof was pretty high well
blackened with smoke too from the fires which had been lighted in it
for many a year gone by

A kind of natural cellar had been made by scooping out the soft
sandstone behind a ledge From this father took a bag of flour and
cornmeal We very soon made some cakes in the pan that tasted well
I can tell you Tea and sugar too and quart pots some bacon in a
flourbag and that rasher fried in the pan was the sweetest meat I ever
ate in all my born days

Then father brought out a keg and poured some rum into a pint pot He
took a pretty stiff pull and then handed it to us A little of it
wont hurt you boys he said after a nights work

I took somenot much we hadnt learned to drink thento keep down
the fear of something hanging over us A dreadful fear it is It makes
a coward of every man who doesnt lead a square life let him be as game
as he may

Jim wouldnt touch it No he said when I laughed at him I promised
mother last time I had more than was good for me at Dargo Races that I
wouldnt touch it again for two years and I wont either I can stand
what any other man can and without the hard stuff either

Please yourself said father When youre ready well have a ride
through the stock

We finished our meal and a firstrate one it was A man never has
the same appetite for his meals anywhere else that he has in the bush
specially if he has been up half the night Its so fresh and the air
makes him feel as if hed ate nothing for a week Sitting on a log or
in the cave as we were Ive had the best meal Ive ever tasted since
I was born Not like the closefeeling closesmelling dirtyclean
graveyard they call a gaol But its no use beginning on that We were
young men and free too Free By all the devils in hell if there are
devilsand there must be to tempt a man or how could he be so great a
fool so blind a born idiot as to do anything in this world that would
put his freedom in jeopardy And what for For folly and nonsense For
a few pounds he could earn with a months honest work and be all the
better man for it For a false womans smile that he could buy and ten
like her if he only kept straight and saving For a bit of sudden pride
or vanity or passion A short bit of what looks like pleasure against
months and years of weariness and cold and heat and dull halfdeath
with maybe a dogs death at the end

I could cry like a child when I think of it now I have cried manys
the time and often since I have been shut up here and dashed my head
against the stones till I pretty nigh knocked all sense and feeling out
of it not so much in repentance though I dont say I feel sorry
but to think what a fool fool fool Id been Yes fool three times
overa hundred timesto put my liberty and life against such a
miserable stakea stake the devil that deals the pack is so safe to win
at the end

I may as well go on But I cant help breaking out sometimes when I hear
the birds calling to one another as they fly over the yard and know
its fresh air and sun and green grass outside that I never shall see
again Never see the river rippling under the big drooping trees or
the cattle coming down in the twilight to drink after the long hot day
Never never more And whose fault is it Who have I to blame Perhaps
father helped a bit but I knew better and no one is half as much to
blame as myself

Where were we Oh at the cavemouth coming out with our bridles in our
hands to catch our horses We soon did that and then we rode away to
the other cattle They were a queer lot in fine condition but all
sorts of ages and breeds with every kind of brand and earmark

Lots of the brands we didnt know and had never heard of Some had
no brands at allfullgrown beasts too that was a thing we had very
seldom seen Some of the best cattle and some of the finest horsesand
there were some real plums among the horseshad a strange brand JJ

Who does the JJ brand belong to I said to father Theyre the pick
of the lot whose ever they are

Father looked black for a bit and then he growled out Dont you ask
too many questions lad Theres only four living men besides yourselves
knows about this place so take care and dont act foolishly or youll
lose a plant that may save your life as well as keep you in cash for
many a year to come That brand belongs to Starlight and he was the
only man left alive of the men that first found it and used it to put
away stock in He wanted help and told me five years ago He took in a
halfcaste chap too against my will He helped him with that last lot
of cattle that you noticed

But where did those horses come from Jim said I never hardly saw
such a lot before All got the JJ brand on too and nothing else all
about three year old

They were brought here as foals says father following their
mothers Some of them was foaled here and of course as theyve only
the one brand on they never can be claimed or sworn to Theyre from
some of Mr Maxwells best thoroughbred mares and their sire was Earl
of Atheling imported He was here for a year

Well they might look the real thing said Jim his eyes brightening
as he gazed at them Id like to have that dark bay colt with the star
My word what a forehand hes got and what quarters too If he cant
gallop Ill never say I know a horse from a poley cow

You shall have him or as good never fear if you stick to your work
says father You mustnt cross Starlight for hes a born devil when
hes taken the wrong way though he talks so soft The halfcaste is an
outandout chap with cattle and the horse doesnt stand on four legs
that he cant rideand make follow him for the matter of that But
hes worth watching I dont believe in him myself And now ye have the
lot

And a dd fine lot they are I said for I was vexed with Jim for
taking so easy to the bait father held out to him about the horse A
very smart crowd to be on the roads inside of five years and drag us in
with em

How do you make that out says father Are you going to turn dog now
you know the way in Isnt it as easy to carry on for a few years more
as it was twenty years ago

Not by a long chalk I said for my blood was up and I felt as if I
could talk back to father and give him as good as he sent and all for
Jims sake Poor Jim Hed always go to the mischief for the sake of a
good horse and many another Currency chap has gone the same way Its
a pity for some of em that a blood horse was ever foaled

You think you cant be tracked says I but you must bear in mind you
havent got to do with the oldfashioned mounted police as was potterin
about when this bot was first hit on Theres chaps in the police
getting now natives or all the same as can ride and track every bit
as well as the halfcaste youre talking about Some day theyll drop on
the track of a mob coming in or getting out and then the game will be
all up

You can cut it if you like now said father looking at me curious
like Dont say I dragged you in You and your brother can go home and
no one will ever know where you were no more than if youd gone to the
moon

Jim looked at the brown colt that just came trotting up as dad finished
speakingtrotting up with his head high and his tail stuck out like
a circus horse If hed been the devil in a horsehide he couldnt have
chosen a better moment Then his eyes began to glitter

We all three looked at each other No one spoke The colt stopped
turned and galloped back to his mates like a red flyer with the dogs
close behind him

It was not long We all began to speak at once But in that time the die
was cast the stakes were down and in the pool were three mens lives

I dont care whether we go back or not says Jim Ill do either way
that Dick likes But that colt I must have

I never intended to go back I said But were three dd fools all
the samefather and sons Itll be the dearest horse you ever bought
Jim old man and so I tell you

Well I suppose its settled now says father so lets have no more
chat Were like a pack of old women blessed if we aint

After that we got on more sociably Father took us all over the place
and a splendid paddock it waswalled all round but where we had come
in and a narrow gash in the far side that not one man in a thousand
could ever hit on except he was put up to it a wild country for miles
when you did get outall scrub and rock that few people ever had call
to ride over There was splendid grass everywhere water and shelter
It was warmer too than the country above as you could see by the
coats of the cattle and horses

If it had only been honestly come by Jim said what a jolly place it
would have been

Towards the north end of the paddock was a narrow gully with great
sandstone walls all round and where it narrowed the first discoverers
had built a stockyard partly with dry stone walls and partly with logs
and rails

There was no trouble in getting the cattle or horses into this and
there were all kinds of narrow yards and pens for branding the stock if
they were clearskins and altering or faking the brands if they were
plain This led into another yard which opened into the narrowest part
of the gully Once in this like the one they came down and the cattle
or horses had no chance but to walk slowly up one behind the other
till they got on the tableland above Here of course every kind of
work that can be done to help disguise cattle was done Earmarks were
cut out and altered in shape or else the whole ear was cropped off
every letter in the alphabet was altered by means of straight bars or
halfcircles figures crosses everything you could think of

Mr Starlight is an edicated man said father This is all his
notion and many a man has looked at his own beast with the ears
altered and the brand faked and never dreamed he ever owned it Hes a
great card is Starlight Its a pity he ever took to this kind of life

Father said this with a kind of real sorrow that made me look at him to
see if the grog had got into his head just as if his life mine and
Jims didnt matter a straw compared to this mans whoever he was that
had had so many better chances than we had and had chucked em all away

But its a strange thing that I dont think theres any place in the
world where men feel a more real outandout respect for a gentleman
than in Australia Everybodys supposed to be free and equal now of
course they couldnt be in the convict days But somehow a man thats
born and bred a gentleman will always be different from other men to the
end of the world Whats the most surprising part of it is that men like
father who have hated the breed and suffered by them too cant help
having a curious liking and admiration for them Theyll follow them
like dogs fight for them shed their blood and die for them must be
some sort of a natural feeling Whatever it is its there safe enough
and nothing can knock it out of ninetenths of all the men and women you
meet I began to be uneasy to see this wonderful mate of fathers
who was so many things at oncea cattlestealer a bushranger and a
gentleman




Chapter 6



After wed fairly settled to stay father began to be more pleasant than
hed ever been before We were pretty likely he said to have a visit
from Starlight and the halfcaste in a day or two if wed like to wait
He was to meet him at the Hollow on purpose to help him out with the mob
of fat bullocks we had looked at Father it appears was coming here
by himself when he met this outlying lot of Mr Hunters cattle and
thought he and old Crib could bring them in by themselves And a mighty
good haul it was Father said we should share the weaners between the
three of us that meant 50 Pounds a piece at least The devil always
helps beginners

We put through a couple of days pleasantly enough after our hardish bit
of work Jim found some fishhooks and a line and we caught plenty
of mullet and eels in the deep clear waterholes We found a couple
of doublebarrelled guns and shot ducks enough to last us a week No
wonder the old frequenters of the Hollow used to live here for a month
at a time having great times of it as long as their grog lasted and
sometimes having the tribe of blacks that inhabited the district to make
merry and carouse with them like the buccaneers of the Spanish Main
that Ive read about till the plunder was all gone There were scrawls
on the wall of the first cave we had been in that showed all the
visitors had not been rude untaught people and Jim picked up part of
a womans dress splashed with blood and in one place among some
smouldering packages and boxes a long lock of womans hair fair
brightbrown that looked as if the name of Terrible Hollow might not
have been given to this lonely wonderful glen for nothing

We spent nearly a week in this way and were beginning to get rather
sick of the life when father who used always to be looking at a bare
patch in the scrub above us said

Theyre coming at last

Who are comingfriends

Why friends of course Thats Starlights signal See that smoke The
halfcaste always sends that uplike the blacks in his mothers tribe
I suppose

Any cattle or horses with them said Jim

No or theyd send up two smokes Theyll be here about dinnertime so
we must get ready for them

We had plenty of time to get ourselves or anything else ready In about
four hours we began to look at them through a strong spyglass which
father brought out By and by we got sight of two men coming along on
horseback on the top of the range the other side of the far wall They
wasnt particularly easy to see and every now and then wed lose sight
of em as they got into thick timber or behind rocks

Father got the spyglass on to em at last pretty clear and nearly
threw it down with an oath

By he says I believe Starlights hurt somehow Hes so infernal
rash I can see the halfcaste holding him on If the police are on his
tracks theyll spring the plant here and the whole thingll be blown

We saw them come to the top of the wall as it were then they stopped
for a long while then all of a sudden they seemed to disappear

Lets go over to the other side says father theyre coming down the
gully now Its a terrible steep rough track worse than the other If
Starlights hurt bad hell never ride down But he has the pluck of the
devil sure enough

We rode over to the other side where there was a kind of gully that
came in something like the one we came in by but rougher and full of
gibbers boulders There was a path but it looked as if cattle could
never be driven or forced up it We found afterwards that they had an
old pack bullock that theyd trained to walk up this and down too
when they wanted him and the other cattle followed in his track as
cattle will

Father showed us a sort of cave by the side of the track where one man
with a couple of guns and a pistol or two could have shot down a small
regiment as they came down one at a time

We stayed in there by the track and after about halfanhour we heard
the two horses coming down slowly step by step kicking the stones down
before them Then we could hear a man groaning as if he couldnt bear
the pain and partly as if he was trying to smother it Then another
mans voice very soft and soothing like trying to comfort another

My heads afire and these cursed ribs are grinding against one
another every step of this infernal ladder Is it far now How he
groaned then

Just got the bottom hold on a bit longer and youll be all right

Just then the leading horse came out into the open before the cave We
had a good look at him and his rider I never forgot them It was a bad
day I ever saw either and many a man had cause to say the same

The horse held up his head and snorted as he came abreast of us and
we showed out He was one of the grandest animals Id ever seen and
I afterwards found he was better than he looked He came stepping down
that beastly rocky goattrack he a clean thoroughbred that ought never
to have trod upon anything rougher than a rolled training track or
the sound bush turf And here he was with a heavy weight on his backa
halfdead fainting man that couldnt hold the reinsand him walking
down as steady as an old mountain bull or a wallaroo on the side of a
creek bank

I hadnt much time to look him over I was too much taken up with the
rider who was lying forward on his chest across a coat rolled round and
strapped in front of the saddle and his arms round the horses neck He
was as pale as a ghost His eyesgreat dark ones they were toowere
staring out of his head I thought he was dead and called out to father
and Jim that he was

They ran up and we lifted him off after undoing some straps and a rope
He was tied on that was what the halfcaste was waiting for at the top
of the gully When we laid him down his head fell back and he looked
as much like a corpse as if he had been dead a day

Then we saw he had been wounded There was blood on his shirt and the
upper part of his arm was bandaged

Its too late father said I hes a dead man What pluck he must
have had to ride down there

Hes worth two dead uns yet said father who had his hand on his
pulse Hold his head up one of you while I go for the brandy How did
he get hit Warrigal

ThatSergeant Goring said the boy a slight activelooking chap
about sixteen that looked as if he could jump into a gum tree and back
again and I believe he could Sergeant Goring he very near grab us
at Dilligah We got a lot of old Jobsons cattle when he came on us He
jump off his horse when he see he couldnt catch us and very near drop
Starlight My word he very nearly fall offjust like that here he
imitated a man reeling in his saddle but the old horse stop steady
with him my word till he come to Then the sergeant fire at him again
hit him in the shoulder with his pistol Then Starlight come to his
senses and we clear My word he couldnt see the way the old horse
went Ha hahere the young devil laughed till the trees and rocks
rang again Gallop different ways too and met at the old needlerock
But they was miles away then

Before the wild boy had come to the end of his story the wounded man had
proved that it was only a dead faint as the women call it not the
real thing And after he had tasted a pannikin full of brandy and water
which father brought him he sat up and looked like a living man once
more

Better have a look at my shoulder he said Thatfellow shot like
a prizewinner at Wimbledon Ive had a squeak for it

Puts me in mind of our old poaching rows said father while he
carefully cut the shirt off that was stiffened with blood and showed
where the bullet had passed through the muscle narrowly missing
the bone of the joint We washed it and relieved the wounded man by
discovering that the other bullet had only been spent after striking
a tree most like when it had knocked the wind out of him and nearly
unhorsed him as Warrigal said

Fill my pipe one of you Who the devil are these lads Yours I
suppose Marston or you wouldnt be fool enough to bring them here Why
didnt you leave them at home with their mother Dont you think you and
I and this devils limb enough for this precious trade of ours

Theyll take their luck as it comes like others growled father
whats good enough for me isnt too bad for them We want another hand
or two to work things right

Oh we do do we said the stranger fixing his eyes on father as if
he was going to burn a hole in him with a burningglass but if Id a
brace of fine boys like those of my own Id hang myself before Id drag
them into the pit after myself

Thats all very fine said father looking very dark and dangerous
Is Mr Starlight going to turn parson Youll be just in time for
well all be shopped if you run against the police like this and next
thing to lay them on to the Hollow by making for it when youre too weak
to ride

What would you have me do Pull up and hold up my hands There was
nowhere else to go and that new sergeant rode devilish well I can tell
you with a big chestnut wellbred horse that gave old Rainbow here all
he knew to lose him Now once for all no more of that Marston
and mind your own business Im the superior officer in this ships
companyyou know that very wellyour business is to obey me and take
second place

Father growled out something but did not offer to deny it We could see
plainly that the stranger was or had been far above our rank whatever
were the reasons which had led to his present kind of life

We stayed for about ten days while the strangers arm got well With
care and rest it soon healed He was pleasant enough too when the
pain went away He had been in other countries and told us all kinds of
stories about them

He said nothing though about his own former ways and we often
wondered whatever could have made him take to such a life Unknown to
father too he gave us good advice warned us that what we were in
was the road to imprisonment or death in due course and not to flatter
ourselves that any other ending was possible

I have my own reasons for leading the life I do he said and must
run my own course of which I foresee the end as plainly as if it was
written in a book before me Your father had a long account to square
with society and he has a right to settle it his own way That yellow
whelp was never intended for anything better But for you ladsand
here he looked kindly in poor old Jims honest face and an honest face
and heart Jims was and that Ill live and die onmy advice to you
is to clear off home when we go and never come back here again Tell
your father you wont come cut loose from him once and for all Youd
better drown yourselves comfortably at once than take to this cursed
trade Now mind what I tell you and keep your own counsel

By and by the day came when the horses were run in for father and Mr
Starlight and Warrigal who packed up to be off for some other part

When they were in the yard we had a good look at his own horsea good
lookand if Id been a fellow that painted pictures and that kind of
thing I could draw a middlin good likeness of him now

By George how fond I am of a good horsea real wellbred clinker Id
never have been here if it hadnt been for that I do believe and many
another Currency chap can say the samea horse or a womanthats about
the size of it one or tother generally fetches us I shall never put
foot in stirrup again but Ill try and scratch out a sort of likeness
of Rainbow

He was a dark bay horse nearly brown without a white hair on him He
wasnt above 15 hands and an inch high but looked a deal bigger than
he was for the way he held his head up and carried himself He was deep
and thick through behind the shoulders and girthed ever so much more
than youd think He had a short back and his ribs went out like a
cask long quarter great thighs and hocks wonderful legs and feet of
course to do the work he did His head was plainish but clean and bony
and his eye was big and well opened with no white showing His shoulder
was sloped back that much that he couldnt fall no matter what
happened his fore legs All his paces were good too I believe he could
jumpjump anything he was ridden at and very few horses could get the
better of him for one mile or three

Where hed come from of course we were not to know then He had a
small private sort of brand that didnt belong to any of the big studs
but he was never bred by a poor man I afterwards found out that he was
stolen before he was foaled like many another plum and his dam killed
as soon as she had weaned him So of course no one could swear to him
and Starlight could have ridden past the Supreme Court at the assizes
and never been stopped as far as this horse was concerned

Before we went away father and Starlight had some terrible long talks
and one evening Jim came to me and says he

What do you think theyre up to now

How should I know Sticking up a bank or boning a flock of maiden ewes
to take up a run with They seem to be game for anything Therell be a
hanging match in the family if us boys dont look out

Theres no knowing says Jim with a roguish look in his eye I didnt
think then how near the truth I was but its about a horse this
time

Oh a horse that alters the matter But whats one horse to make such
a shine about

Ah thats the point says poor old Jim its a horse worth talking
about Dont you remember the imported entire that they had his picture
in the papershim that Mr Windhall gave 2000 Pounds for

What the Marquis of Lorne Why you dont mean to say theyre going
for him

By George I do says Jim and theyll have him here and twenty
blood mares to put to him before September

Theyre all gone madtheyll raise the country on us Every police
trooper in the colonyll be after us like a pack of dingoes after an old
man kangaroo when the grounds boggy and theyll run us down too they
cant be off it Whatever made em think of such a big touch as that

That Starlights the devil I think said Jim slowly Father didnt
seem to like it at first but he brought him round bit by bitsaid he
knew a squatter in Queensland he could pass him on to that theyd
keep him there for a year and get a crop of foals by him and when the
derry was off hed take him over himself

But hows he going to nail him People say Windhall keeps him locked up
at night and his box is close to his house

Starlight says he has a friend handy he seems to have one or
two everywhere Its wonderful as father told him where he gets
information

By George it would be a touch and no mistake And if we could get a
few colts by him out of thoroughbred mares we might win half the races
every year on our side and no one a bit the wiser

It did seem a grand sort of thingyoung fools that we wereto get hold
of this wonderful stallion that wed heard so much of as thoroughbred
as Eclipse good as anything England could turn out I say again if
it werent for the horseflesh part of it the fun and hardriding and
tracking and all the rest of it there wouldnt be anything like the
crosswork that there is in Australia It lies partly between that and
the dry weather Theres the long spells of drought when nothing can be
done by young or old Sometimes for months you cant work in the garden
nor plough nor sow nor do anything useful to keep the devil out of
your heart Only sit at home and do nothing or else go out and watch
the grass witherin and the water dryin up and the stock dyin by
inches before your eyes And no change maybe for months The ground
like iron and the sky like brass as the parson said and very true
too last Sunday

Then the youngsters havin so much idle time on their hands take to
gaffin and flash talk and money must be got to sport and pay up if
they lose and the stock all ramblin about and mixed up and theres a
temptation to collar somebodys calves or foals like we did that first
red heifer I shall remember her to my dying day It seems as if I had
put that brand on my own heart when I jammed it down on her soft skin
Anyhow I never forgot it and theres many another like me Ill be
bound

The next morning Jim and I started off home Father said he should stay
in the Hollow till Starlight got round a bit He told us not to tell
mother or Ailie a word about where wed been Of course they couldnt
be off knowin that wed been with him but we were to stall them off
by saying wed been helping him with a bit of bushwork or anything we
could think off Itll do no good and your mothers quite miserable
enough as it is boys he said Shell know time enough and maybe
break her heart over it too Poor Norah

Dashed if I ever heard father say a soft thing before I couldnt a
believed it I always thought he was ironbark outside and in But he
seemed real sorry for once And I was near sayin Why dont ye cut the
whole blessed lot then and come home and work steady and make us all
comfortable and happy But when I looked again his face was all changed
and hardlike Off you go he says with his old voice Next time I
want either of you Ill send Warrigal for you

And with that he walked off from the yard where we had been catching our
horses and never looked nigh us again

We rode away to the low end of the gully and then we led the horses
up foot by foot and hard work it waslike climbing up the roof of a
house We were almost done when we got to the tableland at the top

We made our way to the yard where there were the tracks of the cows
all round about it but nothing but the wild horses had ever been there
since

What a scrubby hole it is said Jim I wonder how in the world they
ever found out the way to the Hollow

Some runaway Government men I believe so that halfcaste chap told
me and a gin  showed em the track down and where to get water and
everything They lived on kangaroos at first Then by degrees they
used to crawl out by moonlight and collar a horse or two or a few
cattle They managed to live there years and years one died one was
killed by the blacks the last man showed it to the chaps that passed
it on to Starlight Warrigals mother or aunt or something was the gin
that showed it to the first white men

  A black woman




Chapter 7



It was pretty late that night when we got home and poor mother and
Aileen were that glad to see us that they didnt ask too many questions
Mother would sit and look at the pair of us for ever so long without
speaking and then the tears would come into her eyes and shed turn
away her head

The old place looked very snug clean and comfortable too after all
the campingout and it was firstrate to have our own beds again Then
the milk and fresh butter and the eggs and baconmy word how Jim did
lay in youd have thought he was goin on all night

By George homes a jolly place after all he said I am going to
stay ever so long this time and work like an old nearside polersee
if I dont Lets look at your hands Aileen my word youve been doin
your share

Indeed has she said mother Its a shame so it is and her with
two big brothers too

Poor Ailie said Jim she had to take an axe had she in her pretty
little hands but she didnt cut all that wood thats outside the door
and I nearly broke my neck over Ill go bail

How do you know says she smiling roguishlike All the world might
have been here for what youd been the wisergoing away nobody knows
where and coming home at night likelike

Bushrangers says I Say it out but we havent turned out yet if
thats what you mean Miss Marston

I dont mean anything but whats kind and loving you naughty boy
says she throwing her arms about my neck but why will you break our
hearts poor mothers and mine by going off in such a wild way and
staying away as if you were doing something that you were ashamed of

Women shouldnt ask questions I said roughly Youll know time
enough and if you never know perhaps its all the better

Jim was alongside of mother by this time lying down like a child on the
old native dogskin rug that we tanned ourselves with wattle bark She
had her hand on his hairthick and curly it was always from a child
She didnt say anything but I could see the tears drip drip down from
her face her head was on Jims shoulder and by and by he put his arms
round her neck I went off to bed I remember and left them to it

Next morning Jim and I were up at sunrise and got in the milkers as we
always did when we were at home Aileen was up too She had done all the
dairying lately by herself There were about a dozen cows to milk and
she had managed it all herself every day that we were away put up the
calves every afternoon drove up the cows in the cold mornings made
the butter which she used to salt and put into a keg and feed the pigs
with the skim milk It was rather hard work for her but I never saw her
equal for farm workrough or smooth And she used to manage to dress
neat and look pretty all the time not like some small settlers
daughters that I have seen slouching about with a pair of Blucher boots
on no bonnet a dirty frock and a petticoat like a blanket ragnot
badlooking girls eitherand their hair like a dry mop No Aileen was
always neat and tidy with a good pair of thick boots outside and a thin
pair for the house when shed done her work

She could frighten a wildish cow and bail up anything that would stay
in a yard with her She could ride like a bird and drive bullocks on a
pinch in a dray or at plough chop wood too as well as here and there
a one But when she was in the house and regularly set down to her
sewing shed look that quiet and steadygoing youd think she was only
fit to teach in a school or sell laces and gloves

And so she was when she was let work in her own way but if she was
crossed or put upon or saw anything going wrong shed hold up her
head and talk as straight as any man I ever saw Shed a look just like
father when hed made up his mind only her way was always the right
way What a difference it makes doesnt it And she was so handsome
with it Ive seen a goodish lot of women since I left the old place
let alone her thats helped to put me where I am but I dont think
I ever saw a girl that was a patch on Aileen for looks She had
a wonderful fair skin and her eyes were large and soft like poor
mothers When she was a little raisedlike youd see a pink flush come
on her cheeks like a peach blossom in September and her eyes had a
bright startled look like a doe kangaroo when she jumps up and looks
round Her teeth were as white and even as a black gins The mouth was
something like fathers and when she shut it up we boys always knew
shed made up her mind and wasnt going to be turned from it But her
heart was that good that she was always thinking of others and not of
herself I believeI knowshed have died for any one she loved She
had more sense than all the rest of us put together Ive often thought
if shed been the oldest boy instead of me shed have kept Jim straight
and managed to drive father out of his cross waysthat is if any one
living could have done it As for riding I have never seen any one that
could sit a horse or handle him through rough thick country like her
She could ride barebacked or next to it sitting sideways on nothing
but a gunnybag and send a young horse flying through scrub and rocks
or down ranges where youd think a horse could hardly keep his feet We
could all ride a bit out of the common if it comes to that Better if
wed learned nothing but how to walk behind a plough year in year out
like some of the folks in fathers village in England as he used to
tell us about when he was in a good humour But thats all as people are
reared I suppose Wed been used to the outside of a horse ever since
we could walk almost and it came natural to us Anyhow I think Aileen
was about the best of the lot of us at that as in everything else

Well for a bit all went on pretty well at home Jim and I worked away
steady got in a tidy bit of crop and did everything that lay in our
way right and regular We milked the cows in the morning and brought in
a big stack of firewood and chopped as much as would last for a month
or two We mended up the paddock fence and tidied the garden The old
place hadnt looked so smart for many a day

When we came in at night old mother used to look that pleased and happy
we couldnt help feeling better in our hearts Aileen used to read
something out of the paper that she thought might amuse us I could read
pretty fair and so could Jim but we were both lazy at it and after
working pretty hard all day didnt so much care about spelling out the
long words in the farming news or the stories they put in All the same
it would have paid us better if wed read a little more and put the
bullocking on one side at odd times A man can learn as much out of
a book or a paper sometimes in an hour as will save his work for a week
or put him up to working to better purpose I can see that nowtoo
late and mores the pity

Anyhow Aileen could read pretty near as fast as any one I ever saw and
she used to reel it out for us as we sat smoking over the fire in a
way that kept us jolly and laughing till it was nearly turningin time
Now and then George Storefield would come and stay an hour or two
He could read well nearly as well as she could Then he had always
something to show her that shed been asking about His place was eight
miles off but hed always get his horse and go home whatever the night
was like

I must be at my work in the morning hed say its more than half
a day gone if you lose that and Ive no halfdays to spare or
quarterdays either

     

So we all got on firstrate and anybody would have thought that there
wasnt a more steadygoing hardworking happy family in the colony No
more there wasnt while it lasted After all what is there thats half
as good as being all right and square working hard for the food you
eat and the sleep you enjoy able to look all the world in the face
and afraid of nothing and nobody

We were so quiet and comfortable till the winter was over and the spring
coming on till about September that I almost began to believe wed
never done anything in our lives we could be made to suffer for

Now and then of course I used to wake up in the night and my thoughts
would go back to Terrible Hollow that wonderful place and one night
with the unbranded cattle and Starlight with the blood dripping on
to his horses shoulder and the halfcaste with his hawks eye
and glittering teethfather with his gloomy face and dark words I
wondered whether it was all a dream whether I and Jim had been in at
all whether any of the crosswork had been found out and if so
what would be done to me and Jim most of all though whether father
and Starlight were away after some big touch and if so where and
what it was and how soon we should hear of it

As for Jim he was one of those happygolucky fellows that didnt
bother himself about anything he didnt see or run against I dont
think it ever troubled him It was the only bad thing hed ever been
in Hed been drawn in against his will and I think he had made up his
mindpretty nearlynot to go in for any more

I have often seen Aileen talking to him and theyd walk along in the
evening when the work was donehe with his arm round her waist and she
looking at him with that quiet pleased face of hers seeming so proud
and fond of him as if hed been the little chap she used to lead
about and put on the old pony and bring into the calfpen when she was
milking I remember he had a fight with a little bullcalf about a week
old that came in with a wild heifer and Aileen made as much of his
pluck as if it had been a mallee scrubber The calf baaed and butted
at Jim as even the youngest of them will if theyve the wild blood
in em and nearly upset him he was only a bit of a toddler But Jim
picked up a loose leg of a milkingstool and the two went at it hammer
and tongs I could hardly stand for laughing till the calf gave him
best and walked

Aileen pulled him out and carried him in to mother telling her that he
was the bravest little chap in the world and I remember I got scolded
for not going to help him How these little things come back

Im beginning to be afraid says George one evening that its going
to be a dry season

Theres plenty of time yet says Jim who always took the bright side
of things it might rain towards the end of the month

I was thinking the same thing I said We havent had any rain
to speak of for a couple of months and that bit of wheat of ours is
beginning to go back The oats look better

Now I think of it put in Jim Dick Dawson came in from outside and
he said things are shocking bad all the frontage bare already and the
water drying up

Its always the way I said bitterlike As soon as a poor mans
got a chance of a decent crop the season turns against him or prices go
down so that he never gets a chance

Its as bad for the rich man isnt it said George Its Gods will
and we cant make or mend things by complaining

I dont know so much about that I said sullenly But its not as
bad for the rich man Even if the squatters suffer by a drought and lose
their stock theyve more stock and money in the bank or else credit to
fall back on while the like of us lose all we have in the world and no
one would lend us a pound afterwards to save our lives

Its not quite so bad as that said George I shall lose my years
work unless rain comes and most of the cattle and horses besides but
I shall be able to get a few pounds to go on with however the season
goes

Oh if you like to bow and scrape to rich people well and good I
said but thats not my way We have as good a right to our share of
the land and some other good things as they have and why should we be
done out of it

If we pay for the land as they do certainly said George

But why should we pay God Almighty I suppose made the land and the
people too one to live on the other Why should we pay for what is our
own I believe in getting my share somehow

Thats a sort of argument that doesnt come out right said George
How would you like another man to come and want to halve the farm with
you

I shouldnt mind I should go halves with some one else who had a
bigger one I said More money too more horses more sheep a bigger
house Why should he have it and not me

Thats a lazy mans argument andwell not an honest mans said
George getting up and putting on his cabbagetree I cant sit and
hear you talk such rot Nobody can work better than you and Jim when
you like I wonder you dont leave such talk to fellows like Frowser
thats always spouting at the Shearers Arms

Nonsense or not if a dry season comes and knocks all our work over I
shall help myself to some ones stuff that has more than he knows what
to do with

Why cant we all go shearing and make as much as will keep us for six
months said George I dont know what wed do without the squatters

Nor I either more ways than one but Jim and I are going shearing next
week So perhaps there wont be any need for duffing after all

Oh Dick said Aileen I cant bear to hear you make a joke of that
kind of thing Dont we all know what it leads to Wouldnt it be better
to live on dry bread and be honest than to be full of money and never
know the day when youd be dragged to gaol

Ive heard all that before but aint there lots of people that have
made their money by all sorts of villainy that look as well as the
best and never see a gaol

Theyre always caught some day says poor Aileen sobbing and what a
dreadful life of anxiety they must lead

Not at all I said Look at Lucksly Squeezer and Fryingpan Jack
Everybody knows how they got their stock and their money See how they
live Theyve got stations and publichouse and town property and they
get richer every year I dont think it pays to be too honest in a dry
country

Youre a naughty boy Dick isnt he Jim she said smiling through
her tears But he doesnt mean half what he says does he

Not he says Jim and very likely well have lots of rain after all




Chapter 8



The big squatter as he was called on our side of the country was Mr
Falkland He was an Englishman that had come young to the colony and
worked his way up by degrees He had had no money when he first came
people said indeed he often said so himself He was not proud at any
rate in that way for he was not above telling a young fellow that he
should never be downhearted because he hadnt a coat to his back or a
shilling in his pocket because he Herbert Falkland had known what
it was to be without either This was the best country in the whole
world he used to say for a gentleman who was poor or a working man
The first sort could always make an independence if they were moderately
strong liked work and did not drink There were very few countries
where idle unsteady people got rich As for the poor man he was the
real rich man in Australia high wages cheap food lodging clothing
travelling What more did he want He could save money live happily
and die rich if he wasnt a fool or a rogue Unfortunately these last
were highly popular professions and many people high and low belonged
to them hereand everywhere else

We were all well up in this kind of talk because for the last two or
three years since we had begun to shear pretty well we had always
shorn at his shed He was one of those gentlemenand he was a
gentleman if ever there was onethat takes a deal of notice of his
working hands particularly if they were young Jim he took a great
fancy to the first moment he saw him He didnt care so much about me

Youre a sulky young dog Richard Marston he used to say Im not
sure that youll come to any good and though I dont like to say all
I hear about your father before you Im afraid he doesnt teach you
anything worth knowing But Jim theres a grand fellow if hed been
caught young and weaned from all of your lot hed have been an honour
to the land he was born in Hes too good for you all

Every one of you gentlemen wants to be a small God Almighty I said
impudently Youd like to break us all in and put us in yokes and bows
like a lot of working bullocks

You mistake me my boy and all the rest of us who are worth calling
men let alone gentlemen We are your best friends and would help you
in every way if youd only let us

I dont see so much of that

Because you often fight against your own good We should like to see
you all have farms of your ownto be all well taught and able to make
the best of your livesnot driven to drink as many of you are because
you have no notion of any rational amusement and anything between hard
work and idle dissipation

And suppose you had all this power I saidfor if I was afraid of
father there wasnt another man living that could overcrow medont
you think youd know the way to keep all the good things for yourselves
Hasnt it always been so

I see your argument he said quite quiet and reasonable just as if I
had been a swell like himselfthat was why he was unlike any other man
I ever knewand it is a perfectly fair way of putting it But your
class might I think always rely upon there being enough kindness and
wisdom in ours to prevent that state of things Unfortunately neither
side trusts the other enough And now the bell is going to ring I
think

Jim and I stopped at Boree shed till all the sheep were cut out It pays
well if the weather is pretty fair and it isnt bad fun when theres
twenty or thirty chaps of the right sort in the shearers hut theres
always some fun going on Shearers work pretty hard and as they buy
their own rations generally they can afford to live well After a hard
days shearingthat is from five oclock in the morning to seven at
night going best pace all the time every man working as hard as if he
was at it for his lifeone would think a man would be too tired to do
anything But we were mostly strong and hearty and at that age a man
takes a deal of killing so we used to have a little cardplaying at
night to pass away the time

Very few of the fellows had any money to spend They couldnt get any
either until shearing was over and they were paid off but theyd get
some one who could write to scribble a lot of I O Us and they did as
well

We used to play allfours and loo and now and then an American
game which some of the fellows had picked up It was strange how soon we
managed to get into big stakes I won at first and then Jim and I began
to lose and had such a lot of I O Us out that I was afraid wed have
no money to take home after shearing Then I began to think what a fool
Id been to play myself and drag Jim into it for he didnt want to play
at first

One day I got a couple of letters from homeone from Aileen and another
in a strange hand It had come to our little postoffice and Aileen had
sent it on to Boree

When I opened it there were a few lines with fathers name at the
bottom He couldnt write so I made sure that Starlight had written
it for him He was quite well it said and to look out for him about
Christmas time he might come home then or send for us to stop at
Boree if we could get work and keep a couple of horses in good trim as
he might want us A couple of fivepound notes fell out of the letter as
I opened it

When I looked at them first I felt a kind of fear I knew what they came
from And I had a sort of feeling that we should be better without them
However the devil was too strong for me Moneys a tempting thing
whether its notes or gold especially when a mans in debt I had begun
to think the fellows looked a little cool on us the last three or four
nights as our losses were growing big

So I gave Jim his share and after tea when we sat down again there
werent more than a dozen of us that were in the card racket I flung
down my note and Jim did his and told them that we owed to take the
change out of that and hand us over their paper for the balance

They all stared for such a thing hadnt been seen since the shearing
began Shearers as a rule come from their homes in the settled
districts very bare They are not very well supplied with clothes their
horses are poor and done up and they very seldom have a note in their
pockets unless they have managed to sell a spare horse on the journey

So we were great men for the time looked at by the others with wonder
and respect We were fools enough to be pleased with it Strangely too
our luck turned from that minute and it ended in our winning not only
our own back but more than as much more from the other men

I dont think Mr Falkland liked these goings on He wouldnt have
allowed cards at all if he could have helped it He was a man that hated
what was wrong and didnt value his own interest a pin when it came in
the way However the shearing hut was our own in a manner of speaking
and as long as we shore clean and kept the shed going the overseer Mr
MIntyre didnt trouble his head much about our doings in the hut
He was anxious to get done with the shearing to get the wool into
the bales before the dust came in and the grass seed ripened and the
clover burrs began to fall

Why should ye fash yoursel I heard him say once to Mr Falkland
aboot these young deevils like the Marstons Theyre as goods ready
money in auld Nicks purse Its bred and born and welded in them Yell
just have the burrs and seeds amang the wool if ye keep losing a smart
shearer for the sake o a wheen cards and dice and yell mak nae heed
of convairtin thae young caterans ony mair than yell change a Norroway
falcon into a barndoor chuckie

I wonder if what he said was trueif we couldnt help it if it was in
our blood It seems like it and yet its hard lines to think a fellow
must grow up and get on the cross in spite of himself and come to the
gallowsfoot at last whether he likes it or not The parson here isnt
bad at all Hes a man and a gentleman too and hes talked and read
to me by the hour I suppose some of us chaps are like the poor stupid
tribes that the Israelites found in Canaan only meant to live for a bit
and then to be rubbed out to make room for better people

When the shearing was nearly over we had a Saturday afternoon to
ourselves We had finished all the sheep that were in the shed and old
MIntyre didnt like to begin a fresh flock So we got on our horses and
took a ride into the township just for the fun of the thing and for
a little change The horses had got quite fresh with the rest and
the spring grass Their coats were shining and they all looked very
different from what they did when we first came Our two were not so
poor when they came so they looked the best of the lot and jumped
about in style when we mounted Ah only to think of a good horse

All the men washed themselves and put on clean clothes Then we had our
dinner and about a dozen of us started off for the town

Poor old Jim how well he looked that day I dont think you could pick
a young fellow anywhere in the countryside that was a patch on him for
good looks and manliness somewhere about six foot or a little over as
straight as a rush with a bright blue eye that was always laughing and
twinkling and curly dark brown hair No wonder all the girls used to
think so much of him He could do anything and everything that a man
could do He was as strong as a young bull and as active as a rock
wallabyand ride Well he sat on his horse as if he was born on one
With his broad shoulders and upright easy seat he was a regular picture
on a good horse

And he had a good one under him today a big brown resolute
wellbred horse he had got in a swap because the man that had him was
afraid of him Now that he had got a little flesh on his bones he looked
something quite out of the common A deal too good for a poor man and
him honest as old MIntyre said

But Jim turned on him pretty sharp and said he had got the horse in a
fair deal and had as much right to a good mount as any one elsesuper
or squatter he didnt care who he was

And Mr Falkland took Jims part and rather made Mr MIntyre out in
the wrong for saying what he did The old man didnt say much more only
shook his head saying

Ah yere a grand laddie and buirdly and no that thrawn eitherlike
ye Dick ye born deevil looking at me But I misdoot sair yell die
wi your boots on Theres a smack o Johnnie Armstrong in the glint o
yer ee Yell be to dree yer weird theres nae help fort

Whats all that lingo Mr MIntyre called out Jim all goodnatured
again Is it French or Queensland blacks yabber Blest if I understand
a word of it But I didnt want to be nasty only I am regular shook on
this old moke I believe and hes as square as Mr Falklands dogcart
horse

Maybe ye bocht him fair eneugh Ill no deny you I saw the receipt
mysel But where did yon langleggit longlockit Fish River
mosstrooping callant win haud o him Answer me that Jeems

That says nothing answered Jim Im not supposed to trace back every
horse in the country and find out all the people that owned him since he
was a foal Hes mine now and mine hell be till I get a better one

A contumaacious and stiffnecked generation said the old man
walking off and shaking his head And yet hes a fine laddie a graand
laddie wad he be with good guidance Its the Lords doing nae doot
and we daurna fault it its wondrous in our een

That was the way old Mac always talked Droll lingo wasnt it




Chapter 9



Well away we went to this township Bundah was the name of it not that
there was anything to do or see when we got there It was the regular
upcountry village with a publichouse a store a pound and a
blacksmiths shop However a publichouse is not such a bad placeat
any rate its better than nothing when a fellows young and redhot for
anything like a bit of fun or even a change Some people can work away
day after day and year after year like a bullock in a team or a horse
in a chaffcutting machine Its all the better for them if they can
though I suppose they never enjoy themselves except in a coldblooded
sort of way But theres other men that cant do that sort of thing and
its no use talking They must have life and liberty and a free range
Theres some birds and animals too that either pine in a cage or kill
themselves and I suppose its the same way with some men They cant
stand the cage of whats called honest labour which means working
for some one else for twenty or thirty years never having a day to
yourself or doing anything you like and saving up a trifle for your
old age when you cant enjoy it I dont wonder youngsters break traces
and gallop off like a colt out of a team

Besides sometimes theres a goodlooking girl even at a bush public
the daughter or the barmaid and its odd now what a difference that
makes Theres a few glasses of grog going a little noisy rattling
talk a few smiles and a saucy answer or two from the girl a look at
the last newspaper or a bit of the town news from the landlord hes
always time to read Hang himI mean confound himfor hes generally a
sly old spider who sucks us fellows pretty dry and then dont care what
becomes of us Well it dont amount to much but its lifethe only
taste of it that chaps like us are likely to get And people may talk as
much as they like boys and men too will like it and take to it and
hanker after it as long as the world lasts Theres danger in it and
misery and death often enough comes of it but what of that If a man
wants a swim on the seashore he wont stand all day on the beach because
he may be drowned or snapped up by a shark or knocked against a rock
or tired out and drawn under by the surf No if hes a man hell jump
in and enjoy himself all the more because the waves are high and the
waters deep So it was very good fun to us simple as it might sound
to some people It was pleasant to be bowling along over the firm green
turf along the plain through the forest gully and over the creek
Our horses were fresh and we had a scurry or two of course but there
wasnt one that could hold a candle to Jims brown horse He was a
longstriding smooth goer but he got over the ground in wonderful
style He could jump too for Jim put him over a big log fence or two
and he sailed over them like a forester buck over the head of a fallen
wattle

Well wed had our lark at the Bundah Royal Hotel and were coming home
to tea at the station all in good spirits but sober enough when just
as we were crossing one of the roads that came through the runover the
Pretty Plain as they called itwe heard a horse coming along best
pace When we looked who should it be but Miss Falkland the owners
only daughter

She was an only child and the very apple of her fathers eye you may
be sure The shearers mostly knew her by sight because she had taken
a fancy to come down with her father a couple of times to see the shed
when we were all in full work

A sheds not exactly the best place for a young lady to come into
Shearers are rough in their language now and then But every man
liked and respected Mr Falkland so we all put ourselves on our best
behaviour and the two or three flash fellows who had no sense or
decent feeling were warned that if they broke out at all they would get
something to remember it by

But when we saw that beautiful delicatelooking creature stepping down
the boards between the two rows of shearers most of them stripped to
their jerseys and working like steamengines looking curiously and
pitifully at the tired men and the patient sheep with her great soft
dark eyes and fair white face like a lily we began to think wed heard
of angels from heaven but never seen one before

Just as she came opposite Jim who was trying to shear sheep and sheep
with the ringer of the shed who was next on our right the wether he
was holding kicked and knocking the shears out of his hand sent them
point down against his wrist One of the points went right in and
though it didnt cut the sinews as luck would have it the point stuck
out at the other side out spurted the blood and Jim was just going to
let out when he looked up and saw Miss Falkland looking at him with her
beautiful eyes so full of pity and surprise that he could have had his
hand chopped off so he told me afterwards rather than vex her for a
moment So he shut up his mouth and ground his teeth together for it
was no joke in the way of pain and the blood began to run like a blind
creek after a thunderstorm

Oh poor fellow What a dreadful cut Look papa she cried out
Hadnt something better be bound round it How it bleeds Does it pain
much

Not a bit miss said Jim standing up like a schoolboy going to say
his lesson That is it doesnt matter if it dont stop my shearing

Tar sings out my nextdoor neighbour Here boy tar wanted for No
36 Thatll put it all right Jim its only a scratch

You mind your shearing my man said Mr Falkland quietly I dont
know whether Mr MIntyre will quite approve of that last sheep of
yours This is rather a serious wound The best thing is to bind it up
at once

Before any one could say another word Miss Falkland had whipped out her
soft fine cambric handkerchief and torn it in two

Hold up your hand she said Now papa lend me yours With the
last she cleared the wound of the flowing blood and then neatly and
skilfully bound up the wrist firmly with the strips of cambric This she
further protected by her fathers handkerchief which she helped herself
to and finally stopped the blood with

Jim kept looking at her small white hands all the time she was doing
it Neither of us had ever seen such beforethe dainty skin the pink
nails the glittering rings

There she said I dont think you ought to shear any more today
it might bring on inflammation Ill send to know how it gets on
tomorrow

No miss my grateful thanks miss said Jim opening his eyes and
looking as if hed like to drop down on his knees and pray to her I
shall never forget your goodness Miss Falkland if I live till Im a
hundred Then Jim bent his head a bitI dont suppose he ever made
a bow in his life beforeand then drew himself up as straight as a
soldier and Miss Falkland made a kind of bow and smile to us all and
passed out

Jim did shear all the same that afternoon though the tally wasnt any
great things I cant go and lie down in a bunk in the mens hut he
said I must chance it and he did Next day it was worse and very
painful but Jim stuck to the shears though he used to turn white with
the pain at times and I thought hed faint However it gradually got
better and except a scar Jims hand was as good as ever

Jim sent back Mr Falklands handkerchief after getting the cook to wash
it and iron it out with a bit of a broken axletree but the strips of
white handkerchiefone had C F in the cornerhe put away in his
swag and made some foolish excuse when I laughed at him about it

She sent down a boy from the house next day to ask how Jims hand was
and the day after that but she never came to the shed any more So we
didnt see her again

So it was this young lady that we saw coming tearing down the back road
as they called it that led over the Pretty Plain A good way behind we
saw Mr Falkland but he had as much chance of coming up with her as a
cattle dog of catching a brush flyer

The stable boy Billy Donnellan had told us of course like all those
sort of youngsters he was fond of getting among the men and listening
to them talk all about Miss Falklands new mare

She was a great beauty and thoroughbred The stud groom had bought
her out of a travelling mob from New England when she was dogpoor and
hardly able to drag herself along Everybody thought she was going to be
the best ladys horse in the district but though she was as quiet as
a lamb at first she had begun to show a nasty temper lately and to get
very touchy I dont care about chestnuts myself says Master Billy
smoking a short pipe as if he was thirty theyve a deal of temper and
shes got too much white in her eye for my money Im afeard shell do
some mischief afore weve done with her and Miss Falklands that game
as she wont have nothing done to her Id ride the tail off her but
what Id bring her to if I had my way

So this was the brute that had got away with Miss Falkland the day
we were coming back from Bundah Some horses and a good many men and
women are all pretty right as long as theyre well kept under and
starved a bit at odd times But give them an easy life and four feeds of
corn a day and theyre troublesome brutes and mischievous too

It seems this mare came of a strain that had turned out more devils and
killed more grooms and breakers than any other in the country She was
a Troubadour it seems there never was a Troubadour yet that wouldnt
buck and bolt and smash himself and his rider if he got a fright or
his temper was roused Men and women horses and dogs are very much
alike I know which can talk best As to the rest I dont know whether
theres so much for us to be proud of

It seems that this cranky wretch of a mare had been sideling and
fidgeting when Mr Falkland and his daughter started for their ride but
had gone pretty fairlyMiss Falkland like my sister Aileen could ride
anything in reasonwhen suddenly a dead limb dropped off a tree close
to the side of the road

I believe she made one wild plunge and set to she propped and reared
but Miss Falkland sat her splendidly and got her head up When she saw
she could do nothing that way she stretched out her head and went off
as hard as she could lay legs to the ground

She had one of those mouths that are not so bad when horses are going
easy but get quite callous when they are overeager and excited
Anyhow it was like trying to stop a mailcoach going down Mount
Victoria with the brake off

So what we saw was the wretch of a mare coming along as if the devil was
after her and heading straight across the plain at its narrowest part
it wasnt more than halfamile wide there in fact it was more like a
flat than a plain The people about Boree didnt see much open country
so they made a lot out of what they had

The mare like some women when they get their monkey up was clean out
of her senses and I dont believe anything could have held her under a
hide rope with a turn round a stockyard post This was what she wanted
and if it had broken her infernal neck so much the better

Miss Falkland was sitting straight and square with her hands down
leaning a bit back and doing her level best to stop the brute Her hat
was off and her hair had fallen down and hung down her backplenty of
it there was too The mares neck was stretched straight out her mouth
was like a deal board I expect by that time

We didnt sit staring at her all the time you bet We could see the boy
ever so far off We gathered up our reins and went after her not in a
hurry but just collecting ourselves a bit to see what would be the best
way to wheel the brute and stop her

Jims horse was far and away the fastest and he let out to head the
mare off from a creek that was just in front and at the end of the
plain

By George said one of the mena young fellow who lived near the
placethe mares turning off her course and shes heading straight
for the Troopers Downfall where the policeman was killed If she goes
over that theyll be smashed up like a matchbox horse and rider

Whats that I said closing up alongside of him We were all doing
our best and were just in the line to back up Jim who looked as if he
was overhauling the mare fast

Why its a bluff a hundred feet deepa straight dropand rocks at
the bottom Shes making as straight as a beeline for it now blast
her

And Jim dont know it I said hes closing up to her but he doesnt
calculate to do it for a quarter of a mile more hes letting her take
it out of herself

Hell never catch her in time said the young chap My God its an
awful thing isnt it and a fine young lady like herso kind to us
chaps as she was

Ill see if I can make Jim hear I said for though I looked cool
I was as nearly mad as I could be to think of such a girl being lost
before our eyes No I cant do that but Ill TELEGRAPH




Chapter 10



Now Jim and I had had many a long talk together about what we should do
in case we wanted to signal to each other very pressing We thought the
time might come some day when we might be near enough to sign but not
to speak So we hit upon one or two things a little out of the common

The first idea was in case of one wanting to give the other the office
that he was to look out his very brightest for danger and not to trust
to what appeared to be the state of affairs the sign was to hold up
your hat or cap straight over your head If the danger threatened on the
left to shift to that side If it was very pressing and on the jump as
it were quite unexpected and as bad as bad could be the signalman was
to get up on the saddle with his knees and turn half round

We could do this easy enough and a lot of circus tricks besides How
had we learned them Why in the long days we had spent in the saddle
tailing the milkers and searching after lost horses for many a night

As luck would have it Jim looked round to see how we were getting on
and up went my cap I could see him turn his head and keep watching
me when I put on the whole box and dice of the telegraph business He
dropped I could see He took up the brown horse and made such a rush
to collar the mare that showed he intended to see for himself what the
danger was The crossgrained jade She was a wellbred wretch and be
hanged to her Went as if she wanted to win the Derby and gave Jim all
he knew to challenge her We could see a line of timber just ahead of
her and that Jim was riding for his life

By theyll both be over it said the young shearer They cant
stop themselves at that pace and they must be close up now

Hes neck and neck I said Stick to her Jim old man

We were all close together now Several of the men knew the place and
the word had been passed round

No one spoke for a few seconds We saw the two horses rush up at top
speed to the very edge of the timber

By Jove theyre over No hes reaching for her rein Its no use
Nownow Shes saved Oh my God theyre both right By the Lord well
done Hurrah One cheer more for Jim Marston

     

It was all right We saw Jim suddenly reach over as the horses were
going stride and stride saw him lift Miss Falkland from her saddle as
if she had been a child and place her before him saw the brown horse
prop and swing round on his haunches in a way that showed he had
not been called the crack cuttingout horse on a big cattle run for
nothing We saw Jim jump to the ground and lift the young lady down We
saw only one horse

Three minutes after Mr Falkland overtook us and we rode up together
His face was white and his dry lips couldnt find words at first But
he managed to say to Jim when we got up

You have saved my childs life James Marston and if I forget the
service may God in that hour forget me You are a noble fellow You must
allow me to show my gratitude in some way

You neednt thank me so out and out as all that Mr Falkland said
Jim standing up very straight and looking at the father first and then
at Miss Falkland who was pale and trembling not altogether from fear
but excitement and trying to choke back the sobs that would come out
now and then Id risk life and limb any day before Miss Falklands
finger should be scratched let alone see her killed before my eyes I
wonder if theres anything left of the mare poor thing not that she
dont deserve it all and more

Here we all walked forward to the deep creek bank A yard or two farther
and the brown horse and his burden must have gone over the terrible
drop as straight as a plumbline on to the awful rocks below We could
see where the brown had torn up the turf as he struck all four hoofs
deep into it at once Indeed he had been newly shod a freak of Jims
about a bet with a travelling blacksmith Then the other tracks the
long score on the brinkover the brinkwhere the frightened maddened
animal had made an attempt to alter her speed all in vain and had
plunged over the bank and the hundred feet of fall

We peered over and saw a brightcoloured mass among the rocks
belowvery still Just at the time one of the rationcarriers came by
with a spring cart Mr Falkland lifted his daughter in and took the
reins leaving his horse to be ridden home by the rationcarrier As for
us we rode back to the shearers hut not quite so fast as we came with
Jim in the middle He did not seem inclined to talk much

Its lucky I turned round when I did Dick he said at last and saw
you making the dangerlookoutsharp signal I couldnt think what the
dickens it was I was so cocksure of catching the mare in halfamile
farther that I couldnt help wondering what it was all about Anyhow
I knew we agreed it was never to be worked for nothing so thought the
best thing I could do was to call in the mare and see if I could
find out anything then When I got alongside I could see that Miss
Falklands face was that white that something must be up It werent the
mare she was afraid of She was coming back to her It took something to
frighten her I knew So it must be something I did not know or didnt
see

What is it Miss Falkland I said

Oh she cried out dont you know Another fifty yards and well be
over the downfall where the trooper was killed Oh my poor father

Dont be afraid I said Well not go over if I can help it

So I reached over and got hold of the reins I pulled and jerked
She said her hands were cramped and no wonder Pulling double for a
fourmile heat is no joke even if a mans in training Fancy a woman
a young girl having to sit still and drag at a runaway horse all the
time I couldnt stop the brute she was boring like a wild bull So
just as we came pretty close I lifted Miss Falkland off the saddle and
yelled at old Brownie as if I had been on a cattle camp swinging round
to the near side at the same time Round he came like one oclock I
could see the mare make one prop to stop herself and then go flying
right through the air till I heard a beastly thud at the bottom

Miss Falkland didnt faint though she turned white and then red and
trembled like a leaf when I lifted her down and looked up at me with a
sweet smile and said

Jim you have paid me for binding up your wrist havent you You have
saved me from a horrible death and I shall think of you as a brave and
noble fellow all the days of my life

What could I say said Jim I stared at her like a fool Id have
gone over the bank with you Miss Falkland I said if I could not
have saved you

Well Im afraid some of my admirers would have stopped short of that
James she said She did indeed And then Mr Falkland and all of you
came up

I say Jim said one of the young fellows your fortunes made Mr
Falkland ll stand a farm you may be sure for this little fakement

And I say Jack says old Jim very quiet like Ive told you all the
yarn and if theres any chaff about it after this the cove will have to
see whether hes best man or me so dont make any mistake now

There was no more chaff They werent afraid There were two or three
of them pretty smart with their hands and not likely to take much from
anybody But Jim was a heavy weight and could hit like a horse kicking
so they thought it wasnt good enough and left him alone

Next day Mr Falkland came down and wanted to give Jim a cheque for a
hundred but he wouldnt hear of so much as a note Then he said hed
give him a billet on the runmake him under overseer after a bit buy
a farm for him and stock it No Jim wouldnt touch nothing or take a
billet on the place He wouldnt leave his family he said And as for
taking money or anything else for saving Miss Falklands life it was
ridiculous to think of it There wasnt a man of the lot in the shed
down to the tarboy that wouldnt have done the same or tried to All
that was in it was that his horse was the fastest

Its not a bad thing for a poor man to have a fast horse now and then
is it Mr Falkland he said looking up and smiling just like a boy
He was very shy was poor Jim

I dont grudge a poor man a good horse or anything else he likes to
have or enjoy You know that all of you Its the fear I have of the
effect of the dishonest way that horses of value are come by and the
net of roguery that often entangles fine young fellows like you and your
brother thats what I fear said Mr Falkland looking at the pair of
us so kind and pitiful like

I looked him in the face though I felt I could not say he was wrong
I felt too just then as if I could have given all the world to be
afraid of no mans opinion

What a thing it is to be perfectly honest and straightto be able to
look the whole world in the face

But if more gentlemen were like Mr Falkland I do really believe no one
would rob them for very shames sake When shearing was over we were all
paid upshearers washers knockabout men cooks and extra shepherds
Every soul about the place except Mr MIntyre and Mr Falkland seemed
to have got a cheque and a walkingticket at the same time Away they
went like a lot of boys out of school and half of em didnt show as
much sense either As for me and Jim we had no particular wish to go
home before Christmas So as theres always contracts to be let about
a big run like Banda we took a contract for some bush work and went at
it Mr MIntyre looked quite surprised But Mr Falkland praised us up
and was proud we were going to turn over a new leaf

Nobody could say at that time we didnt work Fencing dammaking
horsebreaking stockriding from making hay to building a shed all
bushwork came easy enough to us Jim in particular he took a pleasure
in it and was never happier than when hed had a real tearing days
work and was settling himself after his tea to a good steady smoke A
great smoker hed come to be He never was much for drinking except
now and again and then he could knock it off as easy as any man I ever
seen Poor old Jim He was born good and intended to be so like mother
Like her his luck was dead out in being mixed up with a lot like ours

One day we were out at the back making some lambing yards We were about
twenty miles from the head station and had about finished the job We
were going in the next day We had been camping in an old shepherds hut
and had been pretty jolly all by ourselves There was firstrate feed
for our horses as the grass was being saved for the lambing season Jim
was in fine spirits and as we had plenty of good rations and firstrate
tobacco we made ourselves pretty comfortable

What a jolly thing it is to have nothing on your mind Jim used to
say I hadnt once and what a fine time it was Now Im always waking
up with a start and expecting to see a policeman or that infernal
halfcaste Hes never far off when theres villainy on Some fine day
hell sell us all I really do believe

If he dont somebody else will but why do you pitch upon him You
dont like him somehow I dont see that hes worse than any other
Besides we havent done anything much to have a reward put on us

No thats to come answered Jim very dismally for him I dont see
what else is to come of it Hist isnt that a horses step coming this
way Yes and a man on him too

It was a bright night though only the stars were out but the weather
was that clear that you could see ever so well and hear ever so far
also Jim had a blackfellows hearing his eyes were like a hawks he
could see in about any light and read tracks like a printed book

I could hear nothing at first then I heard a slight noise a good way
off and a stick breaking every now and then

Talk of the devil growled Jim and here he comes I believe thats
Master Warrigal infernal scoundrel that he is Of course hes got a
message from our respectable old dad or Starlight asking us to put our
heads in a noose for them again

How do you know

I know its that ambling horse he used to ride says Jim I can make
out his sideling kind of way of using his legs All amblers do that

Youre right I said after listening for a minute I can hear the
regular pace different from a horses walk

How does he know were here I wonder says Jim

Some of the telegraphs piped us I suppose I answered I begin to
wish they forgot us altogether

No such luck says Jim Lets keep dark and see what this black snake
of a Warrigal will be up to I dont expect hell ride straight up to
the door

He was right The horse hoofs stopped just inside a thick bit of scrub
just outside the open ground on which the hut stood After a few seconds
we heard the cry of the mopoke Its not a cheerful sound at the dead of
night and now for some reason or other it affected Jim and me in
much the same manner I remembered the last time I had heard the bird
at home just before we started over for Terrible Hollow and it seemed
unlucky Perhaps we were both a little nervous we hadnt drunk anything
but tea for weeks We drank it awfully black and strong and a great lot
of it

Anyhow as we heard the quick light tread of the horse pacing in his
twofeetononeside way over the sandy thingrassed soil every moment
coming nearer and nearer and this queer dismalvoiced bird hooting its
hoarse deep notes out of the dark tree that swished and sighedlike
in front of the sandhill a queer feeling came over both of us that
something unlucky was on the boards for us We felt quite relieved when
the horses footsteps stopped After a minute or so we could see a dark
form creeping towards the hut




Chapter 11



Warrigal left his horse at the edge of the timber for fear he might
want him in a hurry I suppose He was pretty fly and never threw
away a chance as long as he was sober He could drink a bit like the
rest of us now and thennot oftenbut when he did it made a regular
devil of himthat is it brought the devil out that lives low down in
most peoples hearts He was a worse one than usual Jim said He saw
him once in one of his breakouts and heard him boast of something hed
done Jim never liked him afterwards For the matter of that he hated
Jim and me too The only living things he cared about were Starlight and
the threecornered weed he rode that had been a brumbee and wouldnt
let any one touch him much less ride him but himself How he used
to snort if a stranger came near him He could kick the eye out of a
mosquito and bite too if he got the chance

As for Warrigal Starlight used to knock him down like a log if he
didnt please him but he never offered to turn upon him He seemed
to like it and looked regular put out once when Starlight hurt his
knuckles against his hard skull

Us he didnt like as I said beforewhy I dont knownor we him
Likes and dislikes are curious things People hardly know the rights of
them But if you take a regular strong down upon a man or woman when you
first see em its ten to one that youll find some day as youve good
reason for it We couldnt say what grounds we had for hating the sight
of Warrigal neither for he was as good a tracker as ever followed man
or beasts He could read all the signs of the bush like a printed book
He could ride any horse in the world and find his way day or night to
any place hed ever once been to in his life

Sometimes we should have been hard pushed when we were making across
country at night only for him Hour after hour hed ride ahead through
scrub or forest up hill or down dale with that brute of a horse of
hishe called him Bilbahambling away till our horses except
Rainbow used to shake the lives out of us jogging I believe he did it
on purpose

He was a fine shot and could catch fish and game in all sorts of ways
that came in handy when we had to keep dark He had pluck enough
and could fight a pretty sharp battle with his fists if he wasnt
overweighted There were white men that didnt at all find him a good
thing if they went to bully him He tried it on with Jim once but he
knocked the seven senses out of him inside of three rounds and that
satisfied him He pretended to make up but I was always expecting him
to play us some dogs trick yet Anyway so far he was all right and
as long as Starlight and us were mixed up together he couldnt hurt one
without the other He came gliding up to the old hut in the dull light
by bits of moves just as if hed been a bush that had changed its
place We pretended to be asleep near the fire

He peeped in through a chink He could see us by the firelight and
didnt suppose we were watching him

Hullo Warrigal sung out Jim suddenly whats up now Some devils
work I suppose or you wouldnt be in it Why dont you knock at a
gentlemans door when you come a visiting

Wasnt sure it was you he answered showing his teeth it dont do
to get sold Might been troopers for all I know

Pity we wasnt said Jim Id have the hobbles on you by this time
and youd have got fitted to rights I wish Id gone into the police
sometimes It isnt a bad game for a chap that can ride and track and
likes a bit of roughandtumble now and then

If Id been a police tracker Id have had as good a chance of nailing
you Jim Marston spoke up Warrigal Perhaps I will some day Mr
Garton wanted me bad once and said theyd never go agin me for old
times But that says nothin Starlights out at the back and the old
man too They want you to go to themsharp

What for

Dunno I was to tell you and show the camp and now gimme some grub
for Ive had nothing since sunrise but the leg of a possum

All right said Jim putting the billy on heres some damper and
mutton to go on with while the tea warms

Wait till I hobble out Bilbah hes as hungry as I am and thirsty too
my word

Take some out of the barrel we shant want it tomorrow said Jim

Hungry as Warrigal wasand when he began to eat I thought he never
would stophe went and looked after his horse first and got him a
couple of buckets of water out of the cask they used to send us out
every week There was no surface water near the hut Then he hobbled him
out of a bit of old sheepyard and came in

The more I know of men the more I see what curious lumps of good and
bad theyre made up of People that wont stick at anything in some ways
will be that soft and goodfeeling in othersten times more so than
your regular good people Any one that thinks all mankinds divided
into good bad and middlin and that they can draft em like a lot of
cattlesome to one yard some to anotherdont know much Theres a
mob in most towns though I think that wants boilin down bad Some
day theyll do it maybe theyll have to when all the good countrys
stocked up After Warrigal had his supper he went out again to see his
horse and then coiled himself up before the fire and wouldnt hardly
say another word

How far was it to where Starlight was

Long way Took me all day to come

Had he been there long

Yes had a camp there

Anybody else with him

Three more men from this side

Did the old man say we were to come at once

Yes or leave it alonewhich you liked

Then he shut his eyes and his mouth too and was soon as fast asleep as
if he never intended to wake under a week

What shall we do Jim I said go or not

If you leave it to me says Jim I say dont go Its only some
other cross cattle or horse racket Were bound to be nobbled some day
Why not cut it now and stick to the square thing We couldnt do better
than were doing now Its rather slow but well have a good cheque by
Christmas

Im half a mind to tell Warrigal to go back and say were not on I
said Lots of other chaps would join without making any bones about
it

Hoohoohoohoo sounded once more the nightbird from the black
tree outside

Dthe bird I believe hes the devil in the shape of a mopoke And
yet I dont like Starlight to think were afraid He and the old man
might be in a fix and want help Suppose we toss up

All right says Jim speaking rather slowly

You couldnt tell from his face or voice how he felt about it but I
believe nowmore than that he let on once to methat he was awfully
cut up about my changing and thought we were just in for a spell of
straightforward work and would stash the other thing for good and all

We put the fire together It burnt up bright for a bit I pulled out a
shilling

If its head we go Jim if its woman we stay here

I sent up the coin we both bent over near the fire to look at it

The head was uppermost

Hoohoohoohoo came the nightbirds harsh croak

There was a heavyish stake on that throw if wed only known Only
ruinonly death Four mens lives lost and three women made miserable
for life

Jim and I looked at one another He smiled and opened the door

Its all the fault of that cursed owl I believe he said Ill have
his life if he waits till its daylight We must be off early and get
up our horses I know what a long day for Warrigal and that ambling
threecornered devil of his meansseventy or eighty miles if its a
yard

We slept sound enough till daybreak and COULD SLEEP then whatever was
on the card As for Jim he slept like a baby always once he turned in
When I woke I got up at once It was half dark there was a little light
in the east But Warrigal had been out before me and was leading his
horse up to the hut with the hobbles in his hand

Our horses were not far off one of them had a bell on Jim had his old
brown and I had a chestnut that I thought nearly as good We werent
likely to have anything to ride that wasnt middlin fast and plucky
Them that overhauled us would have to ride for it We saddled up and
took our blankets and what few things we couldnt do without The rest
stopped in the hut for any one that came after us We left our wages
too and never asked for em from that day to this A trifle like that
didnt matter after what we were going in for Mores the pity

As we moved off my horse propped once or twice and Warrigal looked at
us in a queer side sort of way and showed his teeth a bitsmile nor
laugh it wasnt only a way he had when he thought he knew more than we
did

My word your horses been where the feeds good Were goin a good
way today I wonder if theyll be as flash as they are now

Theyll carry us wherever that threecornered mule of yours will
shuffle to tonight said Jim Never you mind about them You ride
straight and dont get up to any monkey tricks or by George Ill
straighten you so as youll know better next time

You know a lot Jim Marston said the halfcaste looking at him with
his long dark sleepy eyes which I always thought were like a halfroused
snakes Never mind youll know more one of these days Wed better
push on

He went off at a handgallop and then pulled back into a long
darting kind of canter which Bilbah thought was quite the thing for a
journeyanyhow he never seemed to think of stopping itwent on mile
after mile as if he was not going to pull up this side of sundown A
wiry brute always in condition was this said Bilbah and just at this
time as hard as nails Our horses had been doing nothing lately and
being on good young feed had of course got fat and were rather soft

After four or five miles they began to blow We couldnt well pull up
the ground was hard in places and bad for tracking If we went on at the
pace we should cook our horses As soon as we got into a bit of open I
raced up to him

Now look here Warrigal I said you know why youre doing this and
so do I Our horses are not up to galloping fifty or sixty miles on end
just off a spell and with no work for months If you dont pull up and
go our pace Ill knock you off your horse

Oh youre riled he said looking as impudent as he dared but
slackening all the same Pulled up before if I knowed your horses were
getting baked Thought they were up to anything same as you and Jim

So they are Youll find that one of these days If theres work ahead
you ought to have sense enough not to knock smoke out of fresh horses
before we begin

All right Plenty of work to do my word And Starlight said Tell em
to be here today if they can I know hes afraid of some one follerin
up our tracks as it is

Thats all right Warrigal but you ride steady all the same and dont
be tearing away through thick timber like a mallee scrubber thats
got into the open and sees the devil behind him until he can get cover
again We shall be there tonight if its not a hundred miles and
thats time enough

We did drop in for a long day and no mistake We only pulled up for a
short halt in the middle and Warrigals castiron pony was off again
as if he was bound right away for the other side of the continent
However though we were not going slow either but kept up a reasonable
fast pace it must have been past midnight when we rode into Starlights
camp very glad Jim and I were to see the firenot a big one either
We had been taking it pretty easy you see for a month or two and
were not quite so ready for an eightymile ride as if we had been in
something like training The horses had had enough of it too though
neither of them would give in not if wed ridden em twenty mile
farther As for Warrigals Bilbah he was near as fresh as when he
started and kept tossin his head an amblin and pacin away as if he
was walkin for a wager round a ring in a showyard

As we rode up we could see a gunyah made out of boughs and a longish
wing of dogleg fence made light but well put together As soon as we
got near enough a dog ran out and looked as if he was going to worry us
didnt bark either but turned round and waited for us to get off

Its old Crib said Jim with a big laugh blest if it aint
Fathers somewhere handy Theyre going to take up a back block and do
the thing regular Marston Starlight and Companythats the fakement
They want us out to make dams or put up a woolshed or something I dont
see why they shouldnt as well as Crossman and Fakesley Its six of
one and halfadozen of the other as far as being on the square goes
Depend upon it dads turned over a new leaf

Do you fellows want anything to eat said a voice that I knew to be
Starlights If you do theres tea near the fire and some grub in
that flour bag Help yourselves and hobble out your horses Well settle
matters a bit in the morning Your respected parents abed in his
own camp and its just as well not to wake him unless you want his
blessing ere you sleep

We went with Starlight to his gunyah A path led through a clump of
pines so thick that a man might ride round it and never dream there
was anything but more pines inside A clear place had been made in the
sandhill and a snug crib enough rigged with saplings and a few sheets
of bark It was neat and tidy like everything he had to do with I was
at sea when I was young he once said to Jim when he was a bit on
and a man learns to be neat there There was a big chimney outside
and a lot of leaves and rushes out of a swamp which he had made Warrigal
gather

Put your blankets down there boys and turn in Youll see how the
land lies in the morning We didnt want asking twice Jims eyes were
nigh shut as it was The sun was up when we woke

Outside the first thing we saw was father and Starlight talking Both of
these seemed a bit cranky Its a dshame we heard Starlight
say as he turned and walked off We could have done it well enough by
ourselves

I know what Im about says father its all or none Whats the use
of crying after being in it up to our neck

Some day youll think different says Starlight looking back at him

I often remembered it afterwards

Well lads says father looking straight at us I wasnt sure as
youd come Starlight has been barneying with me about sending for you
But weve got a big thing on now and I thought youd like to be in it

We have come says I pretty short Now were here whats the play
called and when does the curtain rise Were on I was riled vexed
at Starlight talking as if we were children and thought Id show as we
were men like a young fool as I was

All right says father and he sat down on a log and began to tell us
how there was any quantity of cattle running at the back where they were
campeda good lot strayed and mixed up from the last dry season and
had never been mustered for years The stockmen hardly ever came out
till the autumn musters One of the chaps that was in it knew all this
side and had told them They were going to muster for a month or so and
drive the mob right through to Adelaide Store cattle were dear then
and we could get them off easy there and come back by sea No one was to
know we were not regular overlanders and when wed got the notes in our
pockets it would be a hard matter to trace the cattle or prove that we
were the men that sold em

How many head do you expect to get says Jim

A thousand or twelve hundred half of em fat and twothirds of them
young cattle

By George thats something like a haul but you cant muster such a
lot as that without a yard

I know that says father Were putting up a yard on a little plain
about a mile from here When they find it itll be an old nest and the
birds flown

Well if that aint the cheekiest thing I ever heard tell of says I
laughingly To put up a yard at the back of a mans run and muster
his cattle for him I never heard the like before nor any one else But
suppose the cove or his men come across it

Taint no ways likely says father Theyre the sleepiest lot of
chaps in this frontage I ever saw Its hardly worth while touching
them Theres no fun in it Its like shooting pheasants when they
aint preserved Theres no risk and when theres no risk theres no
pleasure Anyway thats my notion

Talking about risks why didnt you work that Marquis of Lorne racket
better We saw in the papers that the troopers hunted you so close you
had to kill him in the ranges

Father looked over at us and then began to laughnot long and he broke
off short Laughing wasnt much in his line

Killed him did we And a horse worth nigh on to two thousand pounds
You ought to have known your old father better than that We did kill
A chestnut horse one we picked out a purpose white legs white knee
short under lip everything quite regular We even fed him for a week on
prairie grass just like the Marquis had been eating Bless you we knew
how to work all that We deceived Windhall his own self and he thinks
hes pretty smart No the Marquis is all safeyou know where

I opened my eyes and stared at father

Youve some call to crow if you can work things like that How you ever
got him away beats me but not more than how you managed to keep him hid
with a ring of troopers all round you from every side of the district

We had friends father said Me and Warrigal done all the travelling
by night No one but him could have gone afoot I believe much less led
a blood horse through the beastly scrub and ranges he showed us But the
devil himself could not beat him and that little brute Bilbah in rough
country

I believe you I said thinking of our ride yesterday Its quite
bad enough to follow him on level ground But dont you think our tracks
will be easy to follow with a thousand head of cattle before us Any
fool could do that

It aint that as Im looking at said father of course an old woman
could do it and knit stockings all the time but our dart is to be off
and have a months start before anybody knows they are off the run They
wont think of mustering before fat cattle takes a bit of a turn That
wont be for a couple of months yet Then they may catch us if they
can

We had a long talk with Starlight and what he said came to much the
same One stockman they had squared and he was to stand in They had
got two or three flash chaps to help muster and drive who were to swear
they thought we were dealers and had bought cattle all right One or
two more were to meet us farther on If we could get the cattle together
and clear off before anything was suspected the rest was easy The yard
was nearly up and Jim and I wired in and soon finished it It didnt
want very grand work putting into it as long as it would last our time
So we put it up roughly but pretty strong with pine saplings
The drawing in was the worst for we had to hump the most of them
ourselves Jim couldnt help bursting out laughing from time to time

It does seem such a jolly cheeky thing he said Driving off a mob of
cattle on the quiet Ive known happen once or twice but Im dashed if
ever I heard tell of putting up duffing improvements of a superior class
on a coves run and clearing off with a thousand drafted cattle all
quiet and regular and him pottering about his homestation and never
dropping to it no more than if he was in Sydney

People ought to look after their stock closer than they do I said
It is their fault almost as much as ours But they are too lazy to look
after their own work and too miserable to pay a good man to do it for
them They just get a halfandhalf sort of fellow thatll take low
wages and make it up with duffing and of course hes not likely to look
very sharp after the back country

Youre not far away says Jim but dont you think theyd have to
look precious sharp and get up very early in the morning to be level
with chaps like father and Starlight let alone Warrigal whos as good
by night as day Then theres you and me Dont try and make us out
better than we are Dick were all dscoundrels thats the truth
of it and honest men havent a chance with us except in the long
runexcept in the long run Thats where theyll have us Dick
Marston

Thats quite a long speech for you Jim I said but it dont matter
much that I know of whose fault it is that were in this duffing racket
It seems to be our fate as the chap says in the book Well have a
jolly spree in Adelaide if this journey comes out right And now lets
finish this evening off Tomorrow theyre going to yard the first mob

After that we didnt talk much except about the work Starlight and
Warrigal were out every day and all day The three new hands were some
chaps who formed part of a gang that did most of the horsestealing in
that neighbourhood though they never showed up The way they managed it
was this They picked up any goodlooking nag or secondclass racehorse
that they fell across and took them to a certain place There they met
another lot of fellows who took the horses from them and cleared out to
another colony at the same time they left the horses they had brought
So each lot travelled different ways and were sold in places where they
were quite strange and no one was likely to claim them

After a man had had a year or two at this kind of work he was good or
rather bad for anything These young chaps like us had done pretty
well at these games and one of them falling in with Starlight had
proposed to him to put up a couple of hundred head of cattle on Outer
Back Momberah as the run was called then father and he had seen that
a thousand were as easy to get as a hundred Of course there was a risky
feeling but it wasnt such bad fun while it lasted We were out all day
running in the cattle The horses were in good wind and condition now
we had plenty of rationsflour tea and sugar There was no cart
but some good packhorses just the same as if we were a regular station
party on our own run Father had worked all that before we came We had
the best of fresh beef and veal tooyou may be sure of thatthere was
no stint in that line and at night we were always sure of a yarn from
Starlightthat is if he was in a good humour Sometimes he wasnt and
then nobody dared speak to him not even father

He was an astonishing man certainly Jim and I used to wonder by
the hour what hed been in the old country Hed been all over the
worldin the Islands and New Zealand in America and among Malays and
other strange people that wed hardly ever heard of Such stories as
hed tell us too about slaves and wild chiefs that hed lived with and
gone out to fight with against their enemy People think a great deal
of a dead man now and then in this innocent country he said once
when the grog was uppermost why Ive seen fifty men killed before
breakfast and in cold blood too chopped up alive or next thing to
it and a drove of slavesmen women and childrenas big nearly as
our mob handed over to a slavedealer and driven off in chains just
as youd start a lot of station cattle They didnt like it going off
their run either poor devils The women would try and run back after
their pickaninnies when they dropped just like that heifer when
Warrigal knocked her calf on the head today What a man he was This
was something like life Jim and I thought When wed sold the cattle
if we got em down to Adelaide all right wed take a voyage to some
foreign country perhaps and see sights too What a paltry thing
working for a pound a week seemed when a rise like this was to be made

Well the long and short of it is that we mustered the cattle quite
comfortably nobody coming anext or anigh us any more than if wed
taken the thing by contract You wouldnt have thought there was anybody
nearer than Bathurst Everything seemed to be in our favour So it was
just at the start We drafted out all the worst and weediest of the
cattle besides all the old cows and when we counted the mob out we
had nearly eleven hundred firstrate store cattle lots of fine young
bullocks and heifers more than half fataltogether a prime wellbred
mob that no squatter or dealer could fault in any way if the price was
right We could afford to sell them for a shade under market price for
cash Ready money of course we were bound to have

Just as we were starting there was a fine roan bull came running up with
a small mob

Cut him out and beat him back says father we dont want to be
bothered with the likes of him

Why Im dashed if that aint Hoods imported bull says Billy the
Boy a Monaro native that we had with us I know him well Hows he
come to get back Why the cove gave two hundred and fifty notes for him
afore he left England Ive heard em say

Bring him along said Starlight who came up just then In for a
penny in for a pound Theyll never think of looking for him on the
Coorong and well be there before they miss any cattle worth talking
about

So we took Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge along with us a red roan he
was with a little white about the flank He wasnt more than four year
old Hed been brought out from England as a yearling How hed worked
his way out to this back part of the run where a bull of his quality
aint often seen nobody could say But he was a lively active beast
and hed got into fine hard fettle with living on saltbush dry grass
and scrub for the last few months so he could travel as well as the
others I took particular notice of him from his little waxy horns to
his straight locks and long square quarters And so Id need tobut
that came after He had only a little bit of a private brand on the
shoulder That was easily faked and would come out quite different




Chapter 12



We didnt go straight ahead along any main track to the Lower Murray and
Adelaide exactly That would have been a little too open and barefaced
No we divided the mob into three and settled where to meet in about a
fortnight Three men to each mob Father and Warrigal took one lot they
had the dog old Crib to help them He was worth about two men and a
boy Starlight Jim and I had another and the three stranger chaps
another Wed had a couple of knockabouts to help with the cooking and
stockyard work They were paid by the job They were to stay at the
camp for a week to burn the gunyahs knock down the yard and blind the
track as much as they could

Some of the cattle wed left behind they drove back and forward across
the track every day for a week If rain came they were to drop it and
make their way into the frontage by another road If they heard about
the job being blown or the police set on our track they were to wire to
one of the border townships we had to pass Werent we afraid of their
selling us No not much they were well paid and had often given
father and Starlight information before though they took care never
to show out in the cattle or horsestealing way themselves As long
as chaps in our line have money to spend they can always get good
information and other things too It is when the money runs short that
the danger comes in I dont know whether cattleduffing was ever done
in New South Wales before on such a large scale or whether it will ever
be done again Perhaps not These wire fences stop a deal of crosswork
but it was done then you take my word for ita mans word as hasnt
that long to live that its worth while to lieand it all came out
right that is as far as our getting safe over selling the cattle and
having the money in our pockets

We kept on working by all sorts of outside tracks on the main line of
roada good deal by night toofor the first two or three hundred
miles After we crossed the Adelaide border we followed the Darling down
to the Murray We thought we were all right and got bolder Starlight
had changed his clothes and was dressed like a swellaway on a
roughish trip but still like a swell

They were his cattle he had brought them from one of his stations on
the Narran He was going to take up country in the Northern Territory
He expected a friend out from England with a lot more capital

Jim and I used to hear him talking like this to some of the squatters
whose runs we passed through as grave as you please They used to ask
him to stay all night but he always said he didnt like to leave
his men He made it a practice on the road When we got within a
fortnights drive of Adelaide he rode in and lived at one of the best
hotels He gave out that he expected a lot of cattle to arrive and
got a friend that hed met in the billiardroom and couldnt he play
surprisin to introduce him to one of the leading stock agents there
So he had it all cut and dry when one day Warrigal and I rode in and
the boy handed him a letter touching his hat respectfully as he had
been learned to do before a lot of young squatters and other swells
that he was going out to a picnic with

My confounded cattle come at last he says Excuse me for mentioning
business I began to hope theyd never come pon my soul I did The
time passes so deuced pleasantly here Well theyll all be at the yards
tomorrow You fellows had all better come and see them sold Therell
be a little lunch and perhaps some fizz You go to the stock agents
Runnimall and Co heres their address Jack he says to me looking
me straight in the eyes Theyll send a man to pilot you to the yards
and now off with you and dont let me see your face till tomorrow

How he carried it off He cantered away with the rest of the party as
if he hadnt a thought in the world except about pleasure and honest
business Nobody couldnt have told that he wasnt just like them other
young gentlemen with only their stock and station to think about and
a little fun at the races now and then And what a risk he was running
every minute of his life he and all the rest of us I wasnt sorry to
be out of the town again There were lots of police too Suppose one
of them was to say Richard Marston I arrest you for It hardly
mattered what I felt as if I should have tumbled down with sheer fright
and cowardliness Its a queer thing you feel like that off and on
Other times a man has as much pluck in him as if his life was worth
fighting forwhich it isnt

The agent knew all about us or thought he did and sent a chap to show
Mr Carisforths cattle Charles Carisforth Esq of Sturton Yorkshire
and Banda Waroona and Ebor Downs New South Wales that was the name
he went by the way to the yards We were to draft them all next morning
into separate penscows and bullocks steers and heifers and so on
He expected to sell them all to a lot of farmers and small settlers that
had taken up a new district lately and were very short of stock

You couldnt have come into a better market young fellow says the
agents man to me Our boss hes advertised em that well as therell
be smart bidding between the farmers and some of the squatters Good
store cattles been scarce and these is in such rattling condition
Thats whatll sell em Your master seems a regular freehanded sort
of chap Hes the jolliest squatter theres been in town these years
I hear folk say Puts em in mind of Hawdon and Evelyn Sturt in the old
overlander days

Next day we were at the yards early you bet We wanted to have time to
draft them into pens of twenty to fifty each so that the farmers and
small settlers might have a chance to buy Besides it was the last
day of our work Driving all day and watching half the night is pretty
stiffish work good weather and bad when youve got to keep it up for
months at a time and wed been three months and a week on the road

The other chaps were wild for a spree Jim and I had made up our minds
to be careful still we had a lot to see in a big town like Adelaide
for wed never been to Sydney even in our lives and wed never seen the
sea That was something to look at for the first time wasnt it

Well we got the cattle drafted to rights every sort and size and age
by itself as near as could be Thats the way to draft stock whether
theyre cattle sheep or horses then every man can buy what he likes
best and isnt obliged to lump up one sort with another We had time
to have a bit of dinner None of us had touched a mouthful since before
daylight Then we began to see the buyers come

Thered been a big tent rigged as big as a small woolshed too It came
out in a cart and then another cart came with a couple of waiters and
they laid out a long table of boards on trestles with a real firstclass
feed on it such as wed never seen in our lives before Fowls and
turkeys and tongues and rounds of beef beer and wine in bottles with
gilt labels on Such a setout it was Father began to growl a bit
If hes going to feed the whole country this way hell spend half the
stuff before we get it let alone drawing a down on the whole thing
But Jim and me could see how Starlight had been working the thing to
rights while he was swelling it in the town among the big bugs We told
him the cattle would fetch that much more money on account of the lunch
and the blowing the auctioneer was able to do These would pay for the
feed and the rest of the fallals ten times over When he gets in with
men like his old pals he loses his head I believe father says and
fancies hes what he used to be Hell get fitted quite simple some
day if he doesnt keep a better lookout

That might be but it wasnt to come about this time Starlight came
riding out by and by dressed up like a real gentleman and lookin so
different that Jim and I hardly dared speak to himon a splendid horse
too not Rainbow hed been left behind he was always left within a
hundred miles of The Hollow and he could do it in one day if he was
wanted to and a lot of fine dressed chaps with himyoung squatters
and officers and what not I shouldnt have been surprised if hed
had the Governor out with him They told us afterwards he did dine at
Government House reglar and was made quite free and welcome there

Well he jumps down and shakes hands with us before them all Well
Jack Well Bill and so on calls us his good faithful fellows and
how well wed brought the cattle over nods to father who didnt seem
able to take it all in says hell back us against any stockmen in
Australia has up Warrigal and shows him off to the company Most
intelligent lad Warrigal grinned and showed his white teeth It was as
good as a play

Then everybody goes to lunchswells and selectors Germans and Paddies
natives and immigrants a good many of them too and there was
eating and drinking and speechifying till all was blue By and by the
auctioneer looks at his watch Hed had a pretty good tuckin himself
and they must get to business

Father opened his eyes at the price the first pen brought all prime
young bullocks half fat most of them Then they all went off like
wildfire the big men and the little men bidding quite jealous
sometimes one getting the lot sometimes another One chap made a remark
about there being such a lot of different brands but Starlight said
theyd come from a sort of depot station of his and were the odds and
ends of all the mobs of store cattle that hed purchased the last four
years That satisfied em particularly as he said it in a careless
fierce way which he could put on as if it was like a mansimpudence
to ask him anything It made the people laugh I could see that

By and by we comes to the imported bull He was in a pen by himself
looking firstrate His brand had been faked and the hair had grown
pretty well It would have took a sharp hand to know him again

Well gentlemen says the auctioneer here is the imported bull Duke
of Brunswick It aint often an animal of his quality comes in with a
mob of store cattle but I am informed by Mr Carisforth that he left
orders for the whole of the cattle to be cleared off the run and this
valuable animal was brought away in mistake He was to return by sea
but as he happens to be here today why sooner than disappoint any
intending buyer Mr Carisforth has given me instructions to put him up
and if he realises anything near his value he will be sold

Yes drawls Starlight as if a dozen imported bulls more or less
made no odds to him put him up by all means Mr Runnimall Expectin
rather large shipment of Batess Duchess tribe next month Rather
prefer them on the whole The Duke here is full of Booth blood so
he may just as well go with the others I shall never get what he cost
though I know that Hes been a most expensive animal to me

Many a true word spoken in jest He had good call to know him as well
as the rest of us for a most expensive animal before all was said and
done What he cost us all round it would be hard indeed to cipher up

Anyhow there was a great laugh at Starlights easy way of taking
it First one and then another of the squatters that was going in for
breeding began to bid thinking hed go cheap until they got warm and
the bull went up to a price that we never dreamed hed fetch Everything
seemed to turn out lucky that day One would have thought theyd never
seen an imported bull before The young squatters got running one
another as I said before and he went up to 270 Pounds Then the
auctioneer squared off the accounts as sharp as he could an it took
him all his time what with the German and the small farmers who took
their time about it paying in greasy notes and silver and copper
out of canvas bags and the squatters who were too busy chaffing and
talking among themselves to pay at all It was dark before everything
was settled up and all the lots of cattle delivered Starlight told the
auctioneer hed see him at his office in a deuced high and mighty kind
of way and rode off with his new friend

All of us went back to our camp Our work was over but we had to settle
up among ourselves and divide shares I could hardly believe my eyes
when I saw the cattle all sold and gone and nothing left at the camp
but the horses and the swags

When we got there that night it was late enough After tea father and I
and Jim had a long yarn settling over what we should do and wondering
whether we were going to get clean away with our share of the money
after all

By George says Jim its a big touch and no mistake To think of
our getting over all right and selling out so easy just as if they was
our own cattle Wont there be a jolly row when its all out and the
Momberah people miss their cattle more than half em was theirs
And when they muster they cant be off seein theyre some hundreds
short

Thats whats botherin me says father I wish Starlight hadnt been
so thundering flash with it all Itll draw more notice on us and every
one ll be gassin about this big sale and all that till peoples set
on to ask where the cattle come from and what not

I dont see as it makes any difference I said Somebody was bound
to buy em and wed have had to give the brands and receipts just the
same Only if wed sold to any one that thought there was a cross look
about it wed have had to take half money thats all Theyve fetched
a rattling price through Starlights working the oracle with those
swells and no mistake

Yes but that aint all of it says the old man filling his pipe
Weve got to look at what comes after I never liked that imported
bull being took Theyll rake all the colonies to get hold of him again
particler as he sold for near three hundred pound

We must take our share of the risk along with the money said Jim
We shall have our whack of that according to what they fetched today
Itll be a short life and a merry one though dad if we go on big
licks like this Whatll we tackle nexta bank or Government House

Nothing at all for a good spell if youve any sense growled father
Itll give us all we know to keep dark when this thing gets into the
papers and the police in three colonies are all in full cry like a pack
of beagles The thing is whatll be our best dart now

Ill go back overland says he Starlights going to take Warrigal
with him and theyll be off to the islands for a turn If he knows
whats best for him hell never come back These other chaps say
theyll separate and sell their horses when they get over to the Murray
low down and work their way up by degrees Which way are you boys
going

Jim and I to Melbourne by next steamer I said May as well see a bit
of life now were in it Well come back overland when were tired of
strange faces

All right says father they wont know where Im lyin by for a bit
Ill go bail and the sooner you clear out of Adelaide the better
News like ours dont take long to travel and you might be nabbed very
simple One of ye write a line to your mother and tell her where youre
off to or shell be frettin herself and the gal toofrettin over
what cant be helped But I suppose its the natur o some women

We done our settlingup next day All the sale money was paid over
to Starlight He cashed the cheques and drew the lot in notes and
goldsuch a bundle of em there was He brought them out to us at the
camp and then we whacked the lot There were eight of us that had to
share and share alike How much do you think we had to divide Why not
a penny under four thousand pounds It had to be divided among the eight
of us That came to five hundred a man A lot of money to carry about
that was the worst of it

Next day there was a regular split and squander We didnt wait long
after daylight you bet Father was off and well on his way before the
stars were out of the sky He took Warrigals horse Bilbah back
with him he and Starlight was going off to the islands together and
couldnt take horses with them But he was real sorry to part with the
crossgrained varmint I thought he was going to blubber when he saw
father leading him off Bilbah wouldnt go neither at first pulled
back and snorted and went on as if hed never seen only one man afore
in his life Father got vexed at last and makes a sign to old Crib he
fetches him such a heeler as gave him something else to think of for a
few miles He didnt hang back much after that

The three other chaps went their own road They kept very dark all
through I know their names well enough but theres no use in bringing
them up now

Jim and I cuts off into the town thinking we was due for a little fun
Wed never been in a big town before and it was something new to
us Adelaide aint as grand quite as Melbourne or Sydney but theres
something quiet and homelike about it to my thinkinggreat wide
streets planted with trees lots of steadygoing German farmers with
their vineyards and orchards and droll little waggons The women work
as hard as the men harder perhaps and get brown and scorched up in no
timenot that theyve got much good looks to lose leastways none we
ever saw

We could always tell the German farmers places along the road from one
of our people by looking outside the door If it was an Englishman or an
Australian youd see where theyd throwed out the teapot leavings if
it was a German you wouldnt see nothing They drink their own sour
wine if their vines are old enough to make any or else hop beer but
they wont lay out their money in the tea chest or sugar bag no fear
or the grog either and not far wrong Then the sea I can see poor old
Jims face now the day we went down to the port and he seen it for the
first time

So weve got to the big waterhole at last he said Dont it make
a man feel queer and small to think of its going away right from here
where we stand to the other side of the world Its a long way across

Jim says I and to think weve lived all our lives up to this time
and never set eyes on it before Dont it seem as if one was shut up in
the bush or tied to a gum tree so as one can never have a chance to
see anything I wonder we stayed in it so long

Its not a bad place though it is rather slow and wired in sometimes
says Jim We might be sorry we ever left it yet When does the steamer
go to Melbourne

The day after tomorrow

Ill be glad to be clear off wont you

We went to the theatre that night and amused ourselves pretty well next
day and till the time came for our boat to start for Melbourne We had
altered ourselves a bit had our hair cut and our beards trimmed by
the hairdresser We bought fresh clothes and what with this and the
feeling of being in a new place and having more money in our pockets
than wed ever dreamed about before we looked so transmogrified when
we saw ourselves in the glass that we hardly knew ourselves We had
to change our names too for the first time in our lives and it went
harder against the grain than youd think for all we were a couple of
cattleduffers with a warrant apiece sure to be after us before the
year was out

It sounds ugly says Jim after we had given our names as John Simmons
and Henry Smith at the hotel where we put up at till the steamer
was ready to start I never thought that Jim Marston was to come
to thisto be afraid to tell a fat greasylooking fellow like that
innkeeper what his real name was Seems such a pitiful mean lie dont
it Dick

It isnt so bad as being called No 14 No 221 as they sing out for
the fellows in Berrima Gaol How would you like that Jim

Id blow my brains out first cried out Jim or let some other fellow
do it for me It wouldnt matter which

It was very pleasant those two or three days in Adelaide if theyd
only lasted We used to stroll about the lighted streets till all hours
watching the people and the shops and everything that makes a large city
different from the country The different sorts of people the carts
and carriages buggies and drays ponycarriages and springcarts all
jumbled up together even the fruit and flowers and oysters and fish
under the gaslights seemed strange and wonderful to us We felt as if
we would have given all the world to have got mother and Aileen down to
see it all Then Jim gave a groan

Only to think says he that we might have had all this fun some day
and bought and paid for it honest Now it isnt paid for Its out of
some other mans pocket Theres a curse on it it will have to be paid
in blood or prison time before alls done I could shoot myself for
being such a cursed fool

Too late to think of that I said well have some fun in Melbourne
for a bit anyhow For what comes after we must chance it as weve
done before more than once or twice either

     

Next day our steamer was to sail We got Starlight to come down with us
and show us how to take our passage Wed never done it before and felt
awkward at it Hed made up his mind to go to New Zealand and after
that to Honolulu perhaps to America

Im not sure that Ill ever come back boys he said and if I were
you I dont think I would either If you get over to San Francisco youd
find the Pacific Slope a very pleasant country to live in The people
and the place would suit you all to pieces At any rate Id stay away
for a few years and wait till all this blows over

I wasnt sorry when the steamer cleared the port and got out of sight
of land There we werewhere wed never been beforein blue water
There was a stiff breeze and in halfanhour we shouldnt have turned
our heads if wed seen Hood and the rest of em come riding after us on
seahorses with warrants as big as the mainsail Jim made sure he was
going to die straight off and the pair of us wished wed never seen
Outer Back Momberah nor Hoods cattle nor Starlight nor Warrigal We
almost made up our minds to keep straight and square to the last day of
our lives However the wind died down a bit next day and we both felt
a lot betterbetter in body and worse in mindas often happens Before
we got to Melbourne we could eat and drink smoke and gamble and were
quite ourselves again Wed laid it out to have a reglar good month of
it in town takin it easy and stopping nice and quiet at a good hotel
havin some reasonable pleasure Why shouldnt we see a little life
Wed got the cash and wed earned that pretty hard Its the hardest
earned money of all thats got on the cross if fellows only knew but
they never do till its too late

When we got tired of doing nothing and being in a strange place wed
get across the border above Albury somewhere and work on the mountain
runs till shearing came round again and we could earn a fairish bit of
money Then wed go home for Christmas after it was all over and see
mother and Aileen again How glad and frightened theyd be to see us It
wouldnt be safe altogether but go we would




Chapter 13



We got to Melbourne all right and though its a different sort of a
place from Sydney its a jolly enough town for a couple of young chaps
with money in their pockets Most towns are for the matter of that We
took it easy and didnt go on the spree or do anything foolish No we
werent altogether so green as that We looked out for a quiet place to
lodge near the seaSt Kilda they call it in front of the beachand
we went about and saw all the sights and for a time managed to keep
down the thought that perhaps sooner or later wed be caught and have
to stand our trial for this last affair of ours and maybe one or two
others It wasnt a nice thing to think of and now and then it used
to make both of us take an extra drop of grog by way of driving the
thoughts of it out of our heads Thats the worst of not being straight
and square A mans almost driven to drink when he cant keep from
thinking of all sorts of miserable things day and night We used to go
to the horseyards now and then and the cattleyards too It was like
old times to see the fat cattle and sheep penned up at Flemington and
the butchers riding out on their spicy nags or driving trotters But
their cattleyards was twice as good as ours and me and Jim used often
to wonder why the Sydney people hadnt managed to have something like
them all these years instead of the miserable cockatoo things at
Homebush that wed often heard the drovers and squatters grumble about

However one day as we was sitting on the rails talking away quite
comfortable we heard one butcher say to another My word this is a
smart bit of cattleduffinga thousand head too Whats that says
the other man Why havent you heard of it says the first one and
he pulls a paper out of his pocket with this in big letters Great
Cattle RobberyA thousand head of Mr Hoods cattle were driven off
and sold in Adelaide Warrants are out for the suspected parties who
are supposed to have left the colony Here was a bit of news We felt
as if we could hardly help falling off the rails but we didnt show
it of course and sat there for halfanhour talking to the buyers and
sellers and cracking jokes like the others But we got away home as soon
as we could and then we began to settle what we should do

Warrants were out of course for Starlight and us too He was known
and so were we Our descriptions were sure to be ready to send out all
over the country Warrigal they mightnt have noticed It was common
enough to have a black boy or a halfcaste with a lot of travelling
cattle Father had not shown up much He had an old peajacket on and
they mightnt have dropped down to him or the three other chaps that
were in it with us they were just like any other road hands But about
there being warrants out with descriptions in all the colonies for a
man to be identified but generally known as Starlight and for Richard
and James Marston we were as certain as that we were in St Kilda in
a nice quiet little inn overlooking the beach and what a murder it was
to have to leave it at all

Leave the place we had to do at once It wouldnt do to be strollin
about Melbourne with the chance of every policeman we met taking a
look at us to see if we tallied with a full description they had at
the office Richard and James Marston are twentyfive and twentytwo
respectively both tall and strongly built having the appearance of
bushmen Richard Marston has a scar on left temple James Marston
has lost a front tooth and so on When we came to think of it they
couldnt be off knowing us if they took it into their heads to bail us
up any day They had our height and make We couldnt help looking like
bushmenlike men that had been in the open air all their lives and
that had a look as if saddle and bridle rein were more in our way than
the spade and ploughhandle We couldnt wash the tan off our skins
faces necks arms all showed pretty well that wed come from where the
sun was hot and that wed had our share of it They had my scar got in
a row and Jims front tooth knocked out by a fall from a horse when he
was a boy there was nothing for it but to cut and run

It was time for us to go my boys as the song the Yankee sailor sung
us one night runs and then which way to go Every ship was watched
that close a strange rat couldnt get a passage and besides we had
that feeling we didnt like to clear away altogether out of the old
country there was mother and Aileen still in it and every man woman
and child that wed known ever since we were born A chap feels that
even if he aint much good other ways We couldnt stand the thought of
clearin out for America as Starlight advised us It was like death
to us so we thought wed chance it somewhere in Australia for a bit
longer

Now where we put up a good many drovers from Gippsland used to stay
as they brought in cattle from there The cattle had to be brought over
Swanston Street Bridge and right through the town after twelve oclock
at night Wed once or twice when wed been out late stopped to look
at them and watched the big heavy bullocks and fat cows staring and
starting and slipping all among the lamps and pavements with the street
all so strange and quiet and laughed at the notion of some of the
shopkeepers waking up and seeing a couple of hundred wild cattle with
three or four men behind em shouldering and horning one another then
rushing past their doors at a hard trot or breaking into a gallop for a
bit

Some of these chaps seeing we was cattlemen and knew most things in
that line used to open out about where theyd come from and what a
grand place Gippsland wassplendid grass country rivers that run all
the year round great fattening country and snowy mountains at the
back keeping everything cool in the summer Some of the mountain
country like Omeo that they talked a lot of seemed about one of the
most outoftheway places in the world More than that you could get
back to old New South Wales by way of the Snowy River and then on to
Monaro After that we knew where we were

Going away was easy enough in a manner of speaking but wed been
a month in Melbourne and when you mind that we were not badlooking
chaps fairishly dressed and with our pockets full of money it was
only what might be looked for if we had made another friend or two
besides Mrs Morrison the landlady of our inn and Gippsland drovers
When we had time to turn round a bit in Melbourne of course we began to
make a few friends Wherever a man goes unless he keeps himself that
close that he wont talk to any one or let any one talk to him hes
sure to find some one he likes to be with better than another If hes
old and done with most of his fancies except smokin and drinkin its
a man If hes young and got his life before him its a woman So Jim
and I hadnt been a week in Melbourne before we fell across a couple
ofwell friendsthat we were hard set to leave It was a way of mine
to walk down to the beach every evening and have a look at the boats
in the bay and the fishermen if there were anyanything that might be
going on Sometimes a big steamer would be coming in churning the water
under her paddles and tearing up the bay like a hundred bunyips The
first screwboat Jim and I saw we couldnt make out for the life of us
what she moved by We thought all steamers had paddles Then the sailing
boats flying before the breeze like seagulls and the waves if it
was a rough day rolling and beating and thundering on the beach I
generally stayed till the stars came out before I went back to the
hotel Everything was so strange and new to a man whod seen so
little else except green trees that I was never tired of watching and
wondering and thinking what a little bit of a shabby world chaps like
us lived in that never seen anything but a slab hut maybe all the year
round and a bush public on high days and holidays

Sometimes I used to feel as if we hadnt done such a bad stroke in
cutting loose from all this But then the horrible feeling would come
back of never being safe even for a day of being dragged off and put
in the dock and maybe shut up for years and years Sometimes I used
to throw myself down upon the sand and curse the day when I ever did
anything that I had any call to be ashamed of and put myself in the
power of everything bad and evil in all my life through

Well one day I was strolling along thinking about these things and
wondering whether there was any other country where a man could go and
feel himself safe from being hounded down for the rest of his life
when I saw a woman walking on the beach ahead of me I came up with her
before long and as I passed her she turned her head and I saw she
was one of two girls that we had seen in the landladys parlour one
afternoon The landlady was a good decent Scotch woman and had taken
a fancy to both of us particularly to Jimas usual She thoughtshe
was that simplethat we were upcountry squatters from some farback
place or overseers Something in the sheep or cattle line everybody
could see that we were There was no hiding that But we didnt talk
about ourselves overmuch for very good reasons The less people say the
more others will wonder and guess about you So we began to be looked
upon as bosses of some sort and to be treated with a lot of respect
that we hadnt been used to much before So we began to talk a
bitnatural enoughthis girl and I She was a goodlooking girl with
a wonderful fresh clear skin full of life and spirits and pretty well
taught She and her sister had not been a long time in the country
their father was dead and they had to live by keeping a very small shop
and by dressmaking They were some kind of cousins of the landlady and
the same name so they used to come and see her of evenings and Sundays
Her name was Kate Morrison and her sisters was Jeanie This and a lot
more she told me before we got back to the hotel where she said she was
going to stay that night and keep Mrs Morrison company

After this we began to be a deal better acquainted It all came easy
enough The landlady thought she was doing the girls a good turn by
putting them in the way of a couple of hardworking welltodo fellows
like us and as Jim and the younger one Jeanie seemed to take a fancy
to each other Mrs Morrison used to make up boating parties and we
soon got to know each other well enough to be joked about falling in
love and all the rest of it

After a bit we got quite into the way of calling for Kate and Jeanie
after their days work was done and taking them out for a walk I dont
know that I cared so much for Kate in those days anyhow but by degrees
we got to think that we were what people call in love with each other
It went deeper with her than me I think It mostly does with women I
never really cared for any woman in the world except Gracey Storefield
but she was far away and I didnt see much likelihood of my being able
to live in that part of the world much less to settle down and marry
there So though wed broken a sixpence together and I had my half
I looked upon her as ever so much beyond me and out of my reach and
didnt see any harm in amusing myself with any woman that I might happen
to fall across

So partly from idleness partly from liking and partly seeing that the
girl had made up her mind to throw in her lot with me for good and all
I just took it as it came but it meant a deal more than that if I
could have foreseen the end

I hadnt seen a great many women and had made up my mind that except
a few bad ones they was mostly of one sortgood to lead not hard to
drive and above all easy to see through and understand

I often wonder what there was about this Kate Morrison to make her so
different from other women but she was born unlike them I expect
Anyway I never met another woman like her She wasnt outandout
handsome but there was something very taking about her Her figure
was pretty near as good as a womans could be her step was light and
active her feet and hands were small and she took a pride in showing
them I never thought she had any temper different from other women
but if Id noticed her eyes surely Id have seen it there There was
something very strange and out of the way about them They hardly seemed
so bright when you looked at them first but by degrees if she got
roused and set up about anything theyd begin to burn with a steady
sort of glitter that got fiercer and brighter till youd think theyd
burn everything they looked at The light in them didnt go out again
in a hurry either It seemed as if those wonderful eyes would keep on
shining whether their owner wished it or not

I didnt find out all about her nature at oncetrust a woman for that
Vain and fond of pleasure I could see she was and from having been
always poor in a worrying miserable illcontented way she had got
to be hungry for money and jewels and fine clothes just like a person
thats been starved and shivering with cold longs for a fire and a full
meal and a warm bed Some people like these things when they can get
them but others never seem to think about anything else and would sell
their souls or do anything in the whole world to get what their hearts
are set on When men are like this theyre dangerous but they hardly
hurt anybody only themselves When women are born with hearts of this
sort its a bad lookout for everybody they come near Kate Morrison
could see that I had money She thought I was rich and she made up her
mind to attract me and go shares in my property whatever it might
be She won over her younger sister Jeanie to her plans and our
acquaintance was part of a regular putup scheme Jeanie was a soft
goodtempered goodhearted girl with beautiful fair hair blue eyes
and the prettiest mouth in the world She was as good as she was pretty
and would have worked away without grumbling in that dismal little shop
from that day to this if shed been let alone She was only just turned
seventeen She soon got to like Jim a deal too well for her own good
and used to listen to his talk about the country across the border and
such simple yarns as he could tell her poor old Jim until she said
shed go and live with him under a saltbush if hed come back and marry
her after Christmas And of course he did promise He didnt see any
harm in that He intended to come back if he could and so did I for
that matter Well the long and short of it was that we were both
regularly engaged and had made all kinds of plans to be married at
Christmas and go over to Tasmania or New Zealand when this terrible
blow fell upon us like a shell I did see one explode at a review in
Melbourneand my word what a scatteration it made

Well we had to let Kate and Jeanie know the best way we could that our
business required us to leave Melbourne at once and that we shouldnt
be back till after Christmas if then

It was terrible hard work to make out any kind of a story that would
do Kate questioned and crossquestioned me about the particular kind
of business that called us away like a lawyer Ive seen plenty of that
since until at last I was obliged to get a bit cross and refuse to
answer any more questions

Jeanie took it easier and was that downhearted and miserable at
parting with Jim that she hadnt the heart to ask any questions of any
one and Jim looked about as dismal as she did They sat with their
hands in each others till it was nearly twelve oclock when the
old mother came and carried the girls off to bed We had to start at
daylight next morning but we made up our minds to leave them a hundred
pounds apiece to keep for us until we came back and promised if we were
alive to be at St Kilda next January which they had to be contented
with

Jeanie did not want to take the money but Jim said hed very likely
lose it and so persuaded her

We were miserable and lowspirited enough ourselves at the idea of going
away all in a hurry We had come to like Melbourne and had bit by
bit cheated ourselves into thinking that we might live comfortably and
settle down in Victoria out of reach of our enemies and perhaps live
and die unsuspected

From this dream we were roused up by the confounded advertisement
Detectives and constables would be seen to be pretty thick in all the
colonies and we could not reasonably expect not to be taken some time
or other most likely before another week

We thought it over and over again in every way The more we thought
over it the more dangerous it seemed to stop in Melbourne There was
only one thing for it that was to go straight out of the country The
Gippsland men were the only bushmen we knew at all well and perhaps
that door might shut soon

So we paid our bill They thought us a pair of quiet respectable chaps
at that hotel and never would believe otherwise People may say what
they like but its a great thing to have some friends that can say of
you

Well I never knew no harm of him a better tempered chap couldnt be
and all the time we knowed him he was that particular about his bills
and money matters that a banker couldnt have been more regular He may
have had his faults but we never seen em I believe a deal that was
said of him wasnt true and nothing wont ever make me believe it

These kind of people will stand up for you all the days of your life
and stick to you till the very last moment no matter what you turn out
to be Well theres something pleasant in it and it makes you think
human nature aint quite such a low and paltry thing as some people
tries to make out Anyhow when we went away our good little landlady
and her sister was that sorry to lose us as youd have thought they was
our blood relations As for Jim every one in the house was fit to cry
when he went off from the dogs and cats upwards Jim never was in no
house where everybody didnt seem to take naturally to him Poor old
Jim

We bought a couple of horses and rode away down to Sale with these
chaps that had sold their cattle in Melbourne and was going home It
rained all the way and it was the worst road by chalks wed ever seen
in our lives but the soil was wonderful and the grass was something to
talk about wed hardly ever seen anything like it A few thousand acres
there would keep more stock than half the country wed been used to

We didnt stay more than a day or so in Sale Every morning at breakfast
some one was sure to turn up the paper and begin jabbering about the
same old infernal business Hoods cattle and what a lot were taken
and whether theyll catch Starlight and the other men and so on

We heard of a job at Omeo while we were in Sale which we thought would
just about suit us All the cattle on a run there were to be mustered
and delivered to a firm of stock agents that had bought them they
wanted people to do it by contract at so much a head Anybody who took
it must have money enough to buy stock horses The price per head was
pretty fair what would pay well and we made up our minds to go in for
it

So we made a bargain bought two more horses each and started away
for Omeo It was near 200 miles from where we were We got up there all
right and found a great rich country with a big lake I dont know
how many feet above the sea The cattle were as wild as hares but the
country was pretty good to ride over We were able to keep our horses in
good condition in the paddocks and when we had mustered the whole lot
we found we had a handsome cheque to get

It was a little bit strange buckling to after the easy life wed led for
the last few months but after a day or two we found ourselves as good
men as ever and could spin over the limestone boulders and through
the thick mountain timber as well as ever we did A man soon gets right
again in the fresh air of the bush and as it used to snow there every
now and then the air was pretty fresh you bet particularly in the
mornings and evenings

After wed settled up we made up our minds to get as far as Monaro
and wait there for a month or two After that we might go in for the
shearing till Christmas and then whatever happened we would both make a
strike back for home and have one happy week at any rate with mother
and Aileen

We tried as well as we could to keep away from the large towns and the
regular mail coach road We worked on runs where the snow came down
every now and then in such a way as to make us think that we might be
snowed up alive some fine morning It was very slow and tedious work
but the newspapers seldom came there and we were not worried day
after day with telegrams about our Adelaide stroke and descriptions
of Starlights own look and way of speaking We got into the old way of
working hard all day and sleeping well at night We could eat and drink
well the corned beef and the damper were good and Jim like when we
were at the back of Boree when Warrigal came wished that we could
stick to this kind of thing always and never have any fret or crooked
dealings again as long as we lived

But it couldnt be done We had to leave and go shearing when the spring
came on We did go and went from one big station to the other when the
spring was regularly on and shearers were scarce By and by the weather
gets warmer and we had cut our last shed before the first week in
December

Then we couldnt stand it any longer

I dont care says Jim if theres a policeman standing at every
corner of the street I must make a start for home They may catch us
but our chance is a pretty good one and Id just as soon be lagged
outright as have to hide and keep dark and moulder away life in some of
these Godforsaken spots

So we made up to start for home and chance it We worked our way by
degrees up the Snowy River by Buchan and Galantapee and gradually made
towards Balooka and Buckleys Crossing On the way we crossed some of
the roughest country we had ever seen or ridden over

My word Dick said Jim one day as we were walking along and leading
our horses we could find a place here if we were hard pushed near as
good for hiding in as the Hollow Look at that bit of tableland that
runs up towards Black Mountain any man that could find a track up to it
might live there for a year and all the police of the country be after
him

What would he get to eat if he was there

That long chap we stayed with at Wargulmerang told us that there were
wild cattle on all those tablelands Often they get snowed up in winter
and die making a circle in the snow Then fish in all the creeks
besides the old Snowy and there are places on the south side of him
that people didnt see once in five years I believe I shall make a
camp for myself on the way and live in it till theyve forgot all about
these cursed cattle Rot their hides I wish wed never have set eyes on
one of them

So do I but like many things in the world its too latetoo late
Jim




Chapter 14



One blazing hot day in the Christmas week Jim and I rode up the gap
that led from the Southern road towards Rocky Creek and the little flat
near the water where our hut stood The horses were tired for wed
ridden a long way and not very slow either to get to the old place
How small and queer the old homestead looked and everything about it
after all we had seen The trees in the garden were in full leaf and
we could see that it was not let go to waste Mother was sitting in the
verandah sewing pretty near the same as we went away and a girl was
walking slowly up from the creek carrying a bucket of water It was
Aileen We knew her at once She was always as straight as a rush and
held her head high as she used to do but she walked very slow and
looked as if she was dull and weary of everything All of a sudden Jim
jumped off dropped his horses bridle on the ground and started to
run towards her She didnt see him till he was pretty close then she
looked up astonishedlike and put her bucket down She gave a sudden
cry and rushed over to him the next minute she was in his arms sobbing
as if her heart would break

I came along quiet I knew shed be glad to see mebut bless you she
and mother cared more for Jims little finger than for my whole
body Some people have a way of gettin the biggest share of nearly
everybodys liking that comes next or anigh em I dont know how its
done or what works it But so it is and Jim could always count on
every man woman and child wherever he lived wearing his colours and
backing him right out through thick and thin

When I came up Aileen was saying

Oh Jim my dear old Jim now Ill die happy mother and I were only
talking of you today and wondering whether we should see you at
Christmasand now you have come Oh Dick and you too But we shall be
frightened every time we hear a horses tread or dogs bark

Well were here now Aileen and thats something I had a great
notion of clearing out for San Francisco and turning Yankee What would
you have done then

We walked up to the house leading our horses Jim and Aileen hand in
hand Mother looked up and gave a scream she nearly fell down when we
got in her face was as white as a sheet

Mother of Mercy I vowed to you for this she said sure she hears
our prayers I wanted to see ye both before I died and I didnt think
youd come I was afraid yed be dreadin the police and maybe stay
away for good and all The Lord be thanked for all His mercies

We went in and enjoyed our tea We had had nothing to eat that day since
breakfast but better than all was Aileens pleasant clever tongue
though she said it was getting stiff for want of exercise She wanted
to know all about our travels and was never tired of listening to Jims
stories of the wonders we had seen in the great cities and the strange
places we had been to

Oh how happy you must have been she would say while we have been
pining and wearying here all through last spring and summer and then
winter againcold and miserable it was last year and now Christmas has
come again Dont go away again for a good while or mother and Ill die
straight out

Well what could we say Tell her wed never go away at all if we could
help itonly she must be a good girl and make the best of things for
mothers sake When had she seen father last

Oh he was away a good while once that time you and Jim were at Mr
Falklands back country You must have had a long job then no wonder
youve got such good clothes and look so smartened up like He comes
every now and then just like he used We never know whats become of
him

When was he here last

Oh about a month ago He said he might be here about Christmas but
he wasnt sure And so you saved Miss Falkland from being killed off her
horse Jim Tell me all about it like a good boy and what sort of a
looking young lady is she

All right said Jim Ill unload the story bag before we get through
theres a lot in there yet but I want to look at you and hear you talk
just now Hows George Storefield

Oh hes just the same good kind steadygoing fellow he always was
says she I dont know what we should do without him when youre away
He comes and helps with the cows now and then Two of the horses got
into Bargo pound and he went and released them for us Then a storm
blew off best part of the roof of the barn and the bit of wheat would
have been spoiled only for him Hes the best friend we have

Youd better make sure of him for good and all I said I suppose
hes pretty welltodo now with that new farm he bought the other day

Oh you saw that she said Yes he bought out the Cumberers They
never did any good with Honeysuckle Flat though the land was so good
Hes going to lay it all down in lucerne he says

And then hell smarten up the cottage and sister Aileen ll go over
and live in it says Jim and a better thing she couldnt do

I dont know she said Poor George I wish I was fonder of him
There never was a better man I believe but I cannot leave mother yet
so its no use talking Then she got up and went in

Thats the way of the world says Jim George worships the ground she
treads on and she cant make herself care two straws about him Perhaps
she will in time Shell have the best home and the best chap in the
whole district if she does

Theres a deal of if in this world I said and if were copped
on account of that last job Id like to think she and mother had some
one to look after them good weather and bad

We might have done that and not killed ourselves with work either
said Jim rather sulkily for him and he lit his pipe and walked off
into the bush without saying another word

I thought too how we might have been ten times twenty times as happy
if wed only kept on steady dingdong work like George Storefield
having patience and seeing ourselves get better offeven a littleyear
by year What had he come to And what lay before us And though we were
that fond of poor mother and Aileen that we would have done anything in
the world for themthat is we would have given our lives for them any
dayyet we had left themfather Jim and Ito lead this miserable
lonesome life looked down upon by a lot of people not half good enough
to tie their shoes and obliged to a neighbour for help in every little
distress

Jim and I thought wed chance a few days at home no matter what risk we
ran but still we knew that if warrants were out the old home would be
well watched and that it was the first place the police would come to
So we made up our minds not to sleep at home but to go away every night
to an old deserted shepherds hut a couple of miles up the gully that
we used to play in when we were boys It had been strongly built at
first time was not much matter then and there were no wages to speak
of so that it was a good shelter The weather was that hot too it was
just as pleasant sleeping under a tree as anywhere else So we didnt
show at home more than one at a time and took care to be ready for a
bolt at any time day or night when the police might show themselves
Our place was middling clear all round now and it was hard for any one
on horseback to get near it without warning and if we could once reach
the gully we knew we could run faster than any man could ride

One night latish just as we were walking off to our hut there was a
scratching at the door when we opened it there was old Crib He ran up
to both of us and smelt round our legs for a minute to satisfy himself
then jumped up once to each of us as if he thought he ought to do the
civil thing wagged his stump of a tail and laid himself down He
was tired and had come a long way We could see that and that he was
footsore too We knew that father wasnt so very far off and would soon
be in If thered been anybody strange there Crib would have run back
fast enough then fatherd have dropped there was something up and not
shown No fear of the dog not knowing who was right and who wasnt He
could tell every sort of a man a mile off I believe He knew the very
walk of the police troopers horses and would growl father said if he
heard their hoofs rattle on the stones of the road

About a quarter of an hour after father walks in quiet as usual
Nothing never made no difference to him except he thought it was
worth while He was middlin glad to see us and behaved kind enough
to mother so the poor soul looked quite happy for her It was little
enough of that she had for her share By and by father walks outside
with us and we had a long private talk

It was a brightish kind of starlight night As we walked down to the
creek I thought how often Jim and I had come out on just such a night
possum hunting and came home so tired that we were hardly able to pull
our boots off Then we had nothing to think about when we woke in the
morning but to get in the cows and didnt we enjoy the fresh butter
and the damper and bacon and eggs at breakfast time It seems to me
the older people get the more miserable they get in this world If they
dont make misery for themselves other people do it for em or
just when everythings going straight and theyre doing their duty
firstrate and all that some accident happens em just as if they was
the worst people in the world I cant make it out at all

Well boys says dad youve been lucky so far suppose you had a
pretty good spree in Melbourne You seen the game was up by the papers
didnt you But why didnt you stay where you were

Why of course that brought us away says Jim we didnt want to
be fetched back in irons and thought there was more show for it in the
bush here

But even if theyd grabbed Starlight says the old man youd no call
to be afeard Not much chance of his peaching if it had been a hanging
matter

You dont mean to say there aint warrants against us and the rest of
the lot I said

Theres never a warrant out agin any one but Starlight said the old
man Ive had the papers read to me regular and I rode over to Bargo
and saw the reward of 200 Pounds a chap alongside of me read it as is
offered for a man generally known as Starlight supposed to have left
the country but not a word about you two and me or the boy or them
other coves

So we might as well have stayed where we were Jim Jim gave a kind
of groan Still when you look at it isnt it queer I went on that
they should only spot Starlight and leave us out It looks as if they
was keepin dark for fear of frightening us out of the country but
watching all the same

Its this way I worked it says father rubbing his tobacco in his
hands the old way and bringing out his pipe they couldnt be off
marking down Starlight along of his carryin on so Of course he drawed
notice to himself all roads But the rest of us only come in with
the mob and soon as they was sold stashed the camp and cleared out
different ways Them three fellers is in Queensland long ago and nobody
was to know them from any other road hands I was back with the old mare
and Bilbah in mighty short time I rode em night and day turn about
and they can both travel You kept pretty quiet as luck had it and was
off to Melbourne quick I dont really believe they dropped to any of
us bar Starlight and if they dont nab him we might get shut of it
altogether Ive known worse things as never turned up in this world
and never will now Here the old man showed his teeth as if he were
going to laugh but thought better of it

Anyhow wed made it up to come home at Christmas says Jim but its
all one It would have saved us a deal of trouble in our minds all the
same if wed known there was no warrants out after us two I wonder if
theyll nail Starlight

They cant be well off it says father Hes gone off his head and
stopped in some swell town in New ZealandCanterbury I think its
calledlivin tiptop among a lot of young English swells instead of
makin off for the Islands as he laid out to do

How do you know hes there I said

I know and thats enough snarls father I hear a lot in many ways
about things and people that no one guesses on and I know thisthat
hes pretty well marked down by old Stillbrook the detective as went
down there a month ago

But didnt you warn him

Yes of course as soon as I heard tell but its too late Im
thinking He has the devils luck as well as his own but I always used
to tell him it would fail him yet

I believe youre the smartest man of the crowd dad says Jim laying
his hand on fathers shoulder He could pretty nigh get round the old
chap once in a way could Jim surly as he was What do you think wed
better do Whats our best dart

Father shook off his hand but not roughly and his voice wasnt so hard
when he said

Why stop at home quiet of course and sleep in your beds at night
Dont go planting in the gully or some one ll think youre wanted and
let on to the police Ride about the country till I give you the
office Never fear but Ill have word quick enough Go about and see the
neighbours round just as usual

Jim and I was quite stunned by this bit of news no doubt we was pretty
sorry as ever we left Melbourne but there was nothing for it now but to
follow it out After all we were at home and it was pleasant to think
we wouldnt be hunted for a bit and might ride about the old place and
enjoy ourselves a bit Aileen was as happy as the day was long and poor
mother used to lay her head on Jims neck and cry for joy to have him
with her Even father used to sit in the front under the quinces and
smoke his pipe with old Crib at his feet most as if he thought he was
happy I wonder if he ever looked back to the days when he was a farmin
boy and hadnt took to poaching He must have been a smart handy kind
of lad and what a different look his face must have had then

We had our own horses in pretty good trim so we foraged up Aileens
mare and made it up to ride over to George Storefields and gave him a
lookup Hed been away when we came and now we heard he was home

George has been doing well all this time of course I said I expect
hell turn squatter some day and be made a magistrate

Like enough says Jim More than one we could pick began lower down
than him and sits on the Bench and gives coves like us a turn when
were brought up before em Fancy old George sayin Is anything
known constable of this prisoners anterseedents as I heard old
Higgler say one day at Bargo

Why do you make fun of these things Jim dear says Aileen looking
so solemn and mournful like Oughtnt a steady worker to rise in
life and isnt it sad to see cleverer men and better workersif they
likedkept down by their own fault

Why wasnt your roan mare born black or chestnut says Jim laughing
and pretending to touch her up Come along and lets see if she can
trot as well as she used to do

Poor Lowan says she patting the mares smooth neck she was a
wonderful neat wellbred dark roan with black pointsone of dads
perhaps that hed brought her home one time he was in special good
humour about something Where she was bred or how nobody ever knew
she was born pretty and good How little trouble her life gives her
Its a pity we cant all say as much or have as little on our minds

Whose faults that says Jim The dingo must live as well as the
collie or the sheep either Ones been made just the same as the other
Ive often watched a dingo turn round twice and then pitch himself
down in the long grass like as if he was dead Hes not a bad sort old
dingo and has a good time of it as long as it lasts

Yes till hes trapped or shot or poisoned some day which he always
is said Aileen bitterly I wonder any man should be content with a
wicked life and a shameful death And she struck Lowan with a
switch and spun down the slope of the hill between the trees like a
foresterdoe with the hunterhound behind her

When we came up with her she was all right again and tried to smile
Whatever put her out for the time she always worked things by kindness
and would lead us straight if she could Driven she knew we couldnt
be and I believe she did us about ten times as much good that way as if
she had scolded and raged or even sneered at us

When we rode up to Mr Storefields farm we were quite agreeable and
pleasant again Jim makin believe his horse could walk fastest and
saying that her mares pace was only a double shuffle of an amble like
Bilbahs and she declaring that the mares was a true walkand so
it was The mare could do pretty well everything but talk and all her
paces were firstclass

Old Mrs Storefield was pottering about in the garden with a big
sunbonnet on She was a great woman for flowers

Come along in Aileen my dear she said Graceys in the dairy
shell be out directly George only came home yesterday Who be these
youve got with ye Why Dick she says lookin again with her sharp
old gray eyes its you boy is it Well youve changed a deal too
and Jim too Is he as full of mischief as ever Well God bless you
boys I wish you well I wish you well Come in out of the sun Aileen
and one of you take the horses up to the stable Youll find George
there somewhere

Aileen had jumped down by this time and had thrown her rein to Jim so
we rode up to the stable and a very good one it was not long put up
that we could see How the place had changed and how different it was
from ours We remembered the time when their hut wasnt a patch on ours
when old Isaac Storefield that had been gardener at Mulgoa to some of
the big gentlemen in the old days had saved a bit of money and taken
up a farm but bit by bit their place had been getting better and bigger
every year while ours had stood still and now was going back




Chapter 15



George Storefields place for the old man was dead and all the place
belonged to him and Gracey quite stunned Jim and me Wed been away
more than a year and hed pulled down the old fences and put up
new onesfirstrate work it was too he was always a dead hand at
splitting Then there was a big hayshed chockfull of good sweet hay
and wheat sheaves and last of all the new stable with six stalls
and a loft above and racks all built of ironbark slabs as solid and
reglar as a church Jim said

Theyd a good sixroomed cottage and a new garden fence ever so long
There were more fruit trees in the garden and a lot of good draught
horses standing about that looked well but as if theyd come off a
journey

The stable door opens and out comes old George as hearty as ever but
looking full of business

Glad to see you boys he says what a time youve been away Been
away myself these three months with a lot of teams carrying Ive taken
greatly to the business lately Im just settling up with my drivers
but put the horses in theres chaff and corn in the mangers and Ill
be down in a few minutes Its well on to dinnertime I see

We took the bridles off and tied up the horsesthere was any amount of
feed for themand strolled down to the cottage again

Wonder whether Graceys as nice as she used to be says Jim Next to
Aileen I used to think she wasnt to be beat When I was a little chap
I believed you and she must be married for certain And old George and
Aileen I never laid out any one for myself I remember

The first two dont look like coming off I said Youre the
likeliest man to marry and settle if Jeanie sticks to you

Shed better go down to the pier and drown herself comfortably said
Jim If she knew what was before us all perhaps she would Poor little
Jeanie Wed no right to drag other people into our troubles I believe
were getting worse and worse The sooner were shot or locked up the
better

You wont think so when it comes old man I said Dont bother your
headit aint the best part of youabout things that cant be helped
Were not the only horses that cant be kept on the coursewith a good
turn of speed too

They want shooting like the dingoes as Aileen said Theyre never no
good except to ruin those that back em and disgrace their owners and
the stable they come out of Thats our sort all to pieces Well wed
better come in Gracey ll think were afraid to face her

When we went away last Grace Storefield was a little over seventeen
so now she was nineteen all out and a fine girl shed grown Though I
never used to think her a beauty now I almost began to think she must
be She wasnt tall and Aileen looked slight alongside of her but she
was wonderful fair and fresh coloured for an Australian girl with a
lot of soft brown hair and a pair of clear blue eyes that always looked
kindly and honestly into everybodys face Every look of her seemed to
wish to do you good and make you think that nothing that wasnt square
and right and honest and true could live in the same place with her

She held out both hands to me and said

Well Dick so youre back again You must have been to the end of the
world and Jim too Im very glad to see you both

She looked into my face with that pleased look that put me in mind of
her when she was a little child and used to come toddling up to me
staring and smiling all over her face the moment she saw me Now she was
a grown woman and a sweetlooking one too I couldnt lift her up and
kiss her as I used to do but I felt as if I should like to do it all
the same She was the only creature in the whole world I think that
liked me better than Jim Id been trying to drive all thoughts of her
out of my heart seeing the tangle Id got into in more ways than one
but now the old feeling which had been a part of me ever since Id grown
up came rushing back stronger than ever I was surprised at myself and
looked queer I daresay

Then Aileen laughed and Jim comes to the rescue and says

Dick doesnt remember you Gracey Youve grown such a swell too You
cant be the little girl we used to carry on our backs

Dick remembers very well she says and her very voice was ever so
much fuller and softer dont you Dick and she looked into my face
as innocent as a child I dont think he could pull me out of the water
and carry me up to the cottage now

You tumble in and well try says Jim first man to keep you for
goodeh Gracey Its fine hot weather and Aileen shall see fair
play

Youre just as saucy as ever Jim says she blushing and smiling I
see George coming so I must go and fetch in dinner Aileens going to
help me instead of mother You must tell us all about your travels when
we sit down

When George came in he began to talk to make up for lost time and told
us where he had beena long way out in some new back country just
taken up with sheep He had got a firstrate paying price for his
carriage out and had brought back and delivered a full load of wool

I intend to do it every year for a bit he said I can breed and feed
a good stamp of draught horse here I pay drivers for three waggons and
drive the fourth myself It pays firstrate so far and we had very fair
feed all the way there and back

Suppose you get a dry season I said how will that be

We shall have to carry forage of course but then carriage will be
higher and it will come to the same thing I dont like being so long
away from home but it pays firstrate and I think I see a way to its
paying better still

So youve ridden over to show them the way Aileen he said as the
girls came in very good of you it was I was afraid youd forgotten
the way

I never forget the way to a friends place George she said and
youve been our best friend while these naughty boys have left mother
and me so long by ourselves But youve been away yourself

Only four months he said and after a few more trips I shant want
to go away any more

That will be a good day for all of us she said You know Gracey we
cant do without George can we I felt quite deserted I can tell you

He wouldnt have gone away at all if youd held up your little finger
you know that you hardhearted girl said Grace trying to frown
Its all your fault

Oh I couldnt interfere with Mr Storefields business said Aileen
looking very grave What kind of a country was it you were out in

Not a bad place for sheep and cattle and blacks said poor George
looking rather glum and not a bad country to make money or do anything
but live in but that hot and dry and full of flies and mosquitoes that
Id sooner live on a pound a week down here than take a good station as
a present there That is if I was contented he went on to say with a
sort of a groan

There never was a greater mistake in the world I believe than for a
man to let a woman know how much he cares for her Its right enough if
shes made up her mind to take him no odds what happens But if theres
any halfandhalf feeling in her mind about him and shes uncertain and
doubtful whether she likes him well enough all this downonyourknees
business works against you more than your worst enemy could do I
didnt know so much about it then Ive found it out since worse luck
And I really believe if George had had the savey to crack himself up a
little and say hed met a nice girl or two in the back country and hid
his hand Aileen would have made it up with him that very Christmas and
been a happy woman all her life

When old Mrs Storefield came in she put us through our facings pretty
briskwhere wed been what wed done What took us to Melbournehow
we liked it What kind of people they were and so on We had to tell
her a good lot part of it truth of course but pretty mixed It made
rather a good yarn and I could see Grace was listening with her heart
as well as her ears Jim said generally we met some very nice people in
Melbourne named Jackson and they were very kind to us

Were there any daughters in the family Jim asked Grace

Oh yes three

Were they goodlooking

No rather homely particularly the youngest

What did they do

Oh their mother kept a boardinghouse We stayed there

I dont think I ever knew Jim do so much lying before but after hed
begun he had to stick to it He told me afterwards he nearly broke down
about the three daughters but was rather proud of making the youngest
the ugliest

I can see Graceys as fond of you as ever she was Dick says he
thats why she made me tell all those crammers Its an awful pity we
cant all square it and get spliced this Christmas Aileen would take
George if she wasnt a fool as most women are Id like to bring Jeanie
up here and join George in the carrying business Its going to be a
big thing I can see You might marry Gracey and look after both places
while we were away

And how about Kate

The devil take her and then hed have a bargain I wish youd never
dropped across her and that she wasnt Jeanies sister blurts out
Jim Shell bring bad luck among us before shes done I feel as sure
as were standing here

Its all a toss uplike our lives married or lagged bushwork or
roadwork in irons free or bond We cant tell how it will be with us
this day year

Ive half a mind to shoot myself says Jim and end it all I would
too only for mother and Aileen Whats the use of life that isnt life
but fear and misery from one days end to another and we only just
grown up Its dd hard that a chaps brains dont grow along with
his legs and arms

We didnt ride home till quite the evening Grace would have us stay
for tea it was a pretty hot day so there was no use riding in the sun
George saddled his horse and he and Grace rode part of the way home
with us Hed got regular sunburnt like us and as he could ride a bit
like most natives he looked better outside of a horse than on his own
legs being rather thickset and shortish but his heart was in the
right place like his sisters and his head was screwed on right too
I think more of old George now than I ever did before and wish Id had
the sense to value his independent straightahead nature and the track
it led him as he deserved

Jim and I rode in front with Gracey between us She had on a neat habit
and a better hat and gloves than Aileen but nothing could ever give her
the seat and hand and light easy graceful way with her in the saddle
that our girl had All the same she could ride and drive too and as we
rode side by side in the twilight talking about the places Id been to
and she wanting to know everything Jim drew off a bit when the road got
narrow I felt what a fool Id been to let things slide and would have
given my right hand to have been able to put them as they were three
short years before

At last we got to the Gap it was the shortest halt from their home
George shook hands with Aileen and turned back

Well come and see you next he said

Christmas Eve said Aileen

Christmas Eve let it be says George

All right I said holding Graces hand for a bit And so we
partedfor how long do you think




Chapter 16



When we got home it was pretty late and the air was beginning to cool
after the hot day There was a low moon and everything showed out
clear so that you could see the smallest branches of the trees on Nulla
Mountain where it stood like a dark cloudbank against the western sky
There wasnt the smallest breeze The air was that still and quiet you
could have heard anything stir in the grass or almost a possum digging
his claws into the smooth bark of the white gum trees The curlews set
up a cry from time to time but they didnt sound so queer and shrill as
they mostly do at night I dont know how it was but everything seemed
quiet and pleasant and homelike as if a chap might live a hundred
years if it was all like this and keep growing better and happier
every day I remember all this so particular because it was the only
time Id felt like it for years and I never had the same feeling
afterwardsnor likely to

Oh what a happy day Ive had Aileen said on a sudden Jim and I and
her had been riding a long spell without speaking I dont know when
Ive enjoyed myself so much Ive got quite out of the way of being
happy lately and hardly know the taste of it How lovely it would be
if you and Jim could always stay at home like this and we could do our
work happy and comfortable together without separating and all this
deadly fear of something terrible happening thats never out of my
mind Oh Dick wont you promise me to stop quiet and work steady at
home if youif you and Jim havent anything brought against you

She bent forward and looked into my face as she said this I could see
her eyes shine and every word she said seemed to come straight from her
heart How sad and pitiful she looked and we felt for a moment just as
we did when we were boys and she used to come and persuade us to go on
with our work and not grieve mother and run the risk of a licking from
father when he came home

Her mare Lowan was close alongside of my horse stepping along at her
fast tearing walk throwing up her head and snorting every now and then
but Aileen sat in her saddle better than some people can sit in a chair
she held the rein and whip together and kept her hand on mine till I
spoke

Well do all we can Aileen dear for you and poor mother wont we
Jim I felt soft and downhearted then if ever I did But its too
latetoo late Youll see us now and then but we cant stop at home
quiet nor work about here all the time as we used to do That days
gone Jim knows it as well as me Theres no help for it now Well have
to do like the restenjoy ourselves a bit while we can and stand up to
our fight when the trouble comes

She took her hand away and rode on with her rein loose and her head
down I could see the tears falling down her face but after a bit she
put herself to rights and we rode quietly up to the door Mother was
working away in her chair and father walking up and down before the
door smoking

When we were letting go the horses father comes up and says

Ive got a bit of news for you boys Starlights been took and the
darkie with him

Where I said Somehow I felt struck all of a heap by hearing this
Id got out of the way of thinking theyd drop on him As for Jim
he heard it straight enough but he went on whistling and patting the
mares neck teasing her like because she was so uneasy to get her
headstall off and run after the others

Why in New Zealand to be sure The blamed fool stuck there all this
time just because he found himself comfortably situated among people as
he liked I wonder how hell fancy Berrima after it all Sarves him well
right

But how did you come to hear about it We knew father couldnt read
nor write

I have a chap as is paid to read the papers reglar and to put me
on when theres anything in em as I want to know Hes bin over here
today and give me the office Heres the paper he left

Father pulls out a crumpledup dirtylookin bit of newspaper It
wasnt much to look at but there was enough to keep us in readin and
thinkin too for a good while as soon as we made it out In pretty
big letters too

months since of a cattle robbery on the largest scale when upwards of
a thousand head were stolen from one of Mr Hoods stations driven to
Adelaide and then sold by a party of men whose names have not as yet
transpired It is satisfactory to find that the leader of the gang who
is well known to the police by the assumed name of Starlight with a
halfcaste lad recognised as an accomplice has been arrested by this
active officer It appears that from information received Detective
Stillbrook went to New Zealand and after several months patient
search took his passage in the boat which left that colony in order
to meet the mail steamer outward bound for San Francisco As the
passengers were landing he arrested a gentlemanlike and welldressed
personage who with his servant was about to proceed to Menziess
Hotel Considerable surprise was manifested by the other passengers
with whom the prisoner had become universally popular He indignantly
denied all knowledge of the charge but we have reason to believe that
there will be no difficulty as to identification A large sum of money
in gold and notes was found upon him Other arrests are likely to
follow


This looked bad for a bit we didnt know what to think While Jim and
I was makin it all out with the help of a bit of candle we smuggled
outwe dursnt take it insidefather was smokin his pipein the old
fashionand saying nothing When wed done he put up his pipe in his
pouch and begins to talk

Its come just as I said and knowed it would through Starlights
cussed flashness and carryins on in fine company If hed cleared out
and made for the Islands as I warned him to do and he settled to or as
good afore he left us that day at the camp hed been safe in some o
them Merikin places he was always gassin about and all this wouldnt
a happened

He couldnt help that says Jim he thought theyd never know him
from any other swell in Canterbury or wherever he was Hes been took in
like many another man What I look at is this he wont squeak How are
they to find out that we had any hand in it

Thats what Im dubersome about says father lightin his pipe again
Nobody down there got much of a look at me and I let my beard grow on
the road and shaved clean soons I got back same as I always do Now
the thing is does any one know that you boys was in the fakement

Nobodys likely to know but him and Warrigal The knockabouts and those
other three chaps wont come it on us for their own sakes We may as
well stop here till Christmas is over and then make down to the Barwon
or somewhere thereabouts We could take a long job at droving till the
derrys off a bit

If youll be said by me the old man growls out youll make tracks
for the Hollow afore daylight and keep dark till we hear how the play
goes I know Starlights as close as a springlock but that chap
Warrigal dont cotton to either of you and hes likely to give you away
if hes pinched himselfthats my notion of him

Starlight ll keep him from doing that Jim says the boy ll do
nothing his master dont agree to and hed break his neck if he found
him out in any dogs trick like that

Starlight and he aint in the same cell you take your oath I dont
trust no man except him Ill be off now and if youll take a fools
advice though he is your father youll go too we can be there by
daylight

Jim and I looked at each other

We promised to stay Chrismas with mother and Aileen says he and if
all the devils in hell tried to stop us I wouldnt break my word But
well come to the Hollow on Boxing Day wont we Dick

All right Its only two or three days The day after tomorrows
Chrismas Eve Well chance that as its gone so far

Take your own way growls father Fetch me my saddle The old mares
close by the yard

Jim fetches the saddle and bridle and Crib comes after him out of the
verandah where he had been lying Bless you he knew something was up
Just like a Christian he was and nothing never happened that dad was in
as he wasnt down to

May as well stop till morning dad says Jim as we walked up to the
yard

Not another minute says the old man and he whips the bridle out of
Jims hand and walks over to the old mare She lifts up her head from
the dry grass and stands as steady as a rock

Goodbye he says and he shook hands with both of us if I dont see
you again Ill send you word if I hear anything fresh

In another minute we heard the old mares hoofs proceeding away among
the rocks up the gully and gradually getting fainter in the distance

Then we went in Mother and Aileen had been in bed an hour ago and all
the better for them Next morning we told mother and Aileen that father
had gone They didnt say much They were used to his ways They never
expected him till they saw him and had got out of the fashion of asking
why he did this or that He had reasons of his own which he never told
them for going or coming and theyd left off troubling their heads
about it Mother was always in dread while he was there and they were
far easier in their minds when he was away off the place

As for us we had made up our minds to enjoy ourselves while we could
and we had come to his way of thinking that most likely nothing was
known of our being in the cattle affair that Starlight and the boy had
been arrested for We knew nothing would drag it out of Starlight about
his pals in this or any other job Now theyd got him it would content
them for a bit and maybe take off their attention from us and the
others that were in it

There were two days to Christmas Next day George and his sister would
be over and we all looked forward to that for a good reminder of old
times We were going to have a merry Christmas at home for once in a
way After that we would clear out and get away to some of the far out
stations where chaps like ourselves always made to when they wanted to
keep dark We might have the luck of other men that we had known of
and never be traced till the whole thing had died out and been
halfforgotten Though we didnt say much to each other we had pretty
well made up our minds to go straight from this out We might take up a
bit of back country and put stock on it with some of the money we had
left Lots of men had begun that way that had things against them as bad
as us and had kept steady and worked through in course of time Why
shouldnt we as well as others We wanted to see what the papers said of
us so we rode over to a little post town we knew of and got a copy of
the Evening Times There it all was in full


 CATTLELIFTING EXTRAORDINARY

We have heard from time to time of cattle being stolen in lots of
reasonable size say from ten to one hundred or even as high as two
hundred head at the outside But we never expected to have to record the
erecting of a substantial stockyard and the carrying off and disposing
of a whole herd estimated at a thousand or eleven hundred head chiefly
the property of one proprietor Yet this has been done in New South
Wales and done we regret to say cleverly and successfully It has
just transpired beyond all possibility of mistake that Mr Hoods
Outer Back Momberah run has suffered to that extent in the past winter
The stolen herd was driven to Adelaide and there sold openly The
money was received by the robbers who were permitted to decamp at their
leisure

When we mention the name of the notorious Starlight no one will be
surprised that the deed was planned carried out and executed with
consummate address and completeness It seems matter of regret that we
cannot persuade this illustrious depredator to take the command of our
police force that body of lifeassurers and propertyprotectors which
has proved so singularly ineffective as a preventive service in the
present case On the wellknown proverbial principle we might hope for
the best results under Mr Starlights intelligent supervision We must
not withhold our approval as to one item of success which the force has
scored Starlight himself and a halfcaste henchman have been cleverly
captured by Detective Stillbrook just as the former who has been
ruffling it among the aristocratic settlers of Christchurch was about
to sail for Honolulu The names of his other accomplices six in number
it is said have not as yet transpired


This last part gave us confidence but all the same we kept everything
ready for a bolt in case of need We got up our horses every evening and
kept them in the yard all night The feed was good by the creek nowa
little dried up but plenty of bite and better for horses that had been
ridden far and fast than if it was green We had enough of last years
hay to give them a feed at night and that was all they wanted They
were two pretty good ones and not slow either We took care of that when
we bought them Nobody ever saw us on bad ones since we were boys and
we had broken them in to stand and be caught day or night and to let us
jump on and off at a moments notice

All that day being awful hot and close we stayed in the house and
yarned away with mother and Aileen till they thoughtpoor soulsthat
we had turned over a new leaf and were going to stay at home and be good
boys for the future When a man sees how little it takes to make women
happythem thats good and never thinks of anything but doing their
best for everybody belonging to emits wonderful how men ever make
up their minds to go wrong and bring all that loves them to shame and
grief When theyve got nobody but themselves to think of it dont so
much matter as I know of but to keep on breaking the hearts of those
as never did you anything but good and wouldnt if they lived for a
hundred years is cowardly and unmanly any way you look at it And yet
wed done very little else ourselves these years and years

We all sat up till nigh on to midnight with our hands in one
anothersJim down at mothers feet Aileen and I close beside them on
the old seat in the verandah that father made such a time ago At last
mother gets up and they both started for bed Aileen seemed as if she
couldnt tear herself away Twice she came back then she kissed us
both and the tears came into her eyes I feel too happy she said
I never thought I should feel like this again God bless you both
and keep us all from harm Amen said mother from the next room We
turned out early and had a bathe in the creek before we went up to the
yard to let out the horses There wasnt a cloud in the sky it was safe
to be a roasting hot day but it was cool then The little waterhole
where we learned to swim when we were boys was deep on one side and had
a rocky ledge to jump off The birds just began to give out a note or
two the sun was rising clear and bright and we could see the dark top
of Nulla Mountain getting a sort of rose colour against the sky

George and Gracey ll be over soon after breakfast I said we must
have everything look shipshape as well as we can before they turn up

The horses may as well go down to the flat Jim says we can catch
them easy enough in time to ride back part of the way with them Ill
run up Lowan and give her a bit of hay in the calfpen

We went over to the yard and Jim let down the rails and walked in I
stopped outside Jim had his horse by the mane and was patting his neck
as mine came out when three police troopers rose up from behind the
bushes and covering us with their rifles called out Stand in the
Queens name

Jim made one spring on to his horses back drove his heels into his
flank and was out through the gate and halfway down the hill before
you could wink

Just as Jim cleared the gate a tall man rose up close behind me and took
a cool pot at him with a revolver I saw Jims hat fly off and another
bullet grazed his horses hip I saw the hair fly and the horse make
a plunge that would have unseated most men with no saddle between their
legs But Jim sat close and steady and only threw up his arm and gave a
shout as the old horse tore down the hill a few miles an hour faster

Dn those cartridges said the tall trooper they always put too
much powder in them for close shooting Now Dick Marston he went on
putting his revolver to my head Id rather not blow your brains out
before your people but if you dont put up your hands byIll shoot
you where you stand I had been staring after Jim all the time I
believe I had never thought of myself till he was safe away

Get your horses you dd fools he shouts out to the men and see
if you can follow up that madman Hes most likely knocked off against a
tree by this time

There was nothing else for it but to do it and be handcuffed As the
steel locks snapped I saw mother standing below wringing her hands and
Aileen trying to get her into the house

Better come down and get your coat on Dick said the senior
constable We want to search the place too By Jove we shall get
pepper from Sir Ferdinand when we go in I thought we had you both as
safe as chickens in a coop Who would have thought of Jim givin us the
slip on a barebacked horse without so much as a halter Im devilish
sorry for your family but if nothing less than a thousand head of
cattle will satisfy people they must expect trouble to come of it

What are you talking about I said Youve got the wrong story and
the wrong men

All right well see about that I dont know whether you want any
breakfast but I should like a cup of tea Its deuced slow work
watching all night though it isnt cold Weve got to be in Bargo
barracks tonight so theres no time to lose

It was all over nowthe worst HAD come What fools we had been not to
take the old mans advice and clear out when he did He was safe in the
Hollow and would chuckle to himselfand be sorry toowhen he heard
of my being taken and perhaps Jim The odds were he might be smashed
against a tree perhaps killed at the pace he was going on a horse he
could not guide

They searched the house but the money they didnt get Jim and I had
taken care of that in case of accidents Mother sat rocking herself
backwards and forwards every now and then crying out in a pitiful way
like the women in her country do Ive heard tell when some one of
their people is dead keening I think they call it Well Jim and I
were as good as dead If the troopers had shot the pair of us there and
then same as bushmen told us the black police did their prisoners when
they gave em any trouble it would have been better for everybody
However people dont die all at once when they go to the bad and take
to stealing or drinking or any of the devils favourite traps Pity
they dont and have done with it once and for all

I know I thought so when I was forced to stand there with my hands
chained together for the first time in my life though Id worked for
it I know that and to see Aileen walking about laying the cloth for
breakfast like a dead woman and know what was in her mind

The troopers were civil enough and Goring the senior constable tried
to comfort them as much as he could He knew it was no fault of theirs
and though he said he meant to have Jim if mortal men and horses could
do it he thought he had a fair chance of getting away Hes sure to be
caught in the long run though he went on to say Theres a warrant
out for him and a description in every Police Gazette in the
colonies My advice to him would be to come back and give himself
up Its not a hanging matter and as its the first time youve been
fitted Dick the judge as like as not will let you off with a light
sentence

So they talked away until they had finished their breakfast I couldnt
touch a mouthful for the life of me and as soon as it was all over
they ran up my horse and put the saddle on But I wasnt to ride him No
fear Goring put me on an old screw of a troop horse with one leg like
a gatepost I was helped up and my legs tied under his belly Then one
of the men took the bridle and led me away Goring rode in front and the
other men behind

As we rose the hill above the place I looked back and saw mother drop
down on the ground in a kind of fit while Aileen bent over her and
seemed to be loosening her dress Just at that moment George Storefield
and his sister rode up to the door George jumped off and rushed over to
Aileen and mother I knew Gracey had seen me for she sat on her horse
as if she had been turned to stone and let her reins drop on his neck
Strange things have happened to me since but I shall never forget that
to the last day of my miserable life




Chapter 17



I wasnt in the humour for talking but sometimes anythings better than
ones own thoughts Goring threw in a word from time to time Hed only
lately come into our district and was sure to be promoted everybody
said Like Starlight himself hed seen better days at home in England
but when he got pinched hed taken the right turn and not the wrong one
which makes all the difference He was earning his bread honest anyway
and he was a chap as liked the fun and dash of a mounted policemans
life As for the riskand there is some danger more than people
thinks now and thenhe liked that the best of it He was put out at
losing Jim but he believed he couldnt escape and told me so in a
friendly way Hes inside a circle and he cant get away you mark
my words he said two or three times We have every policestation
warned by wire within a hundred miles of here three days ago Theres
not a man in the colony sharper looked after than Master Jim is this
minute

Then you only heard about us three days ago I said

Thats as it may be he answered biting his lip Anyhow there isnt
a shepherds hut within miles that he can get to without our knowing
it The countrys rough but theres word gone for a black tracker to go
down Youll see him in Bargo before the weeks out

I had a good guess where Jim would make for and he knew enough to hide
his tracks for the last few miles if there was a whole tribe of trackers
after him

That night we rode into Bargo A long day too wed hadwe were all
tired enough when we got in I was locked up of course and as soon as
we were in the cell Goring said Listen to me and put on his official
facedevilish stern and hardlooking he was then in spite of all the
talking and nonsense wed had coming along

Richard Marston I charge you with unlawfully taking stealing and
carrying away in company with others one thousand head of mixed
cattle more or less the property of one Walter Hood of Outer Back
Momberah in or about the month of June last

All right why dont you make it a few more while youre about it

Thatll do he said nodding his head you decline to say anything
Well I cant exactly wish you a merry Christmasfancy this being
Christmas Eve by Jovebut youll be cool enough this deuced hot
weather till the sessions in February which is more than some of us
can say Goodnight He went out and locked the door I sat down on
my blanket on the floor and hid my head in my hands I wonder it didnt
burst with what I felt then Strange that I shouldnt have felt half as
bad when the judge the other day sentenced me to be a dead man in a
couple of months But I was young then

     

Christmas Day Christmas Day So this is how I was to spend it after
all I thought as I woke up at dawn and saw the gray light just
beginning to get through the bars of the window of the cell

Here was I locked up caged ironed disgraced a felon and an outcast
for the rest of my life Jim flying for his life hiding from every
honest man every policeman in the country looking after him and
authorised to catch him or shoot him down like a sheepkilling dog
Father living in the Hollow like a blackfellow in a cave afraid to
spend the blessed Christmas with his wife and daughter like the poorest
man in the land could do if he was only honest Mother half dead with
grief and Aileen ashamed to speak to the man that loved and respected
her from her childhood Gracey Storefield not daring to think of me or
say my name after seeing me carried off a prisoner before her eyes
Here was a load of misery and disgrace heaped up together to be borne
by the whole family now and for the time to comeby the innocent
as well as the guilty And for what Because we had been too idle and
careless to work regularly and save our money though well able to do
it like honest men Because little by little we had let bad dishonest
ways and flash manners grow upon us all running up an account that had
to be paid some day

And now the day of reckoning had comesharp and sudden with a
vengeance Well what call had we to look for anything else We had been
working for it now we had got it and had to bear it Not for want of
warning neither What had mother and Aileen been saying ever since we
could remember Warning upon warning Now the end had come just as they
said Of course I knew in a general way that I couldnt be punished
or be done anything to right off I knew law enough for that The
next thing would be that I should have to be brought up before the
magistrates and committed for trial as soon as they could get any
evidence

After breakfast flour and water or hominy I forget which the warder
told me that there wasnt much chance of my being brought up before
Christmas was over The police magistrate was away on a months leave
and the other magistrates would not be likely to attend before the end
of the week anyway So I must make myself comfortable where I was
Comfortable

Had they caught Jim

Well not that hed heard of but Goring said it was impossible for him
to get away At twelve hed bring me some dinner

I was pretty certain they wouldnt catch Jim in spite of Goring being
so cocksure about it If he wasnt knocked off the first mile or so
hed find ways of stopping or steadying his horse and facing him up to
where we had gone to join father at the tableland of the Nulla Mountain
Once he got near there he could let go his horse Theyd be following
his track while he made the best of his way on foot to the path that
led to the Hollow If he had five miles start of them there as was most
likely all the blacks in the country would never track where he got to
He and father could live there for a month or so and take it easy until
they could slip out and do a bit of fathers old trade That was about
what I expected Jim to do and as it turned out I was as nearly right
as could be They ran his track for ten miles Then they followed his
horsetracks till late the second day and found that the horse had
slued round and was making for home again with nobody on him Jim was
nowhere to be seen and theyd lost all that time never expecting that
he was going to dismount and leave the horse to go his own way

They searched Nulla Mountain from top to bottom but some of the
smartest men of the old Mounted Police and the best of the stockmen
in the old daysmen not easy to beathad tried the same country many
years before and never found the path to the Hollow So it wasnt
likely any one else would They had to come back and own that they were
beat which put Goring in a rage and made the inspector Sir Ferdinand
Morringer blow them all up for a lot of duffers and old women
Altogether they had a bad time of it not that it made any difference to
me

After the holidays a magistrate was fished up somehow and I was brought
before him and the apprehending constables evidence taken Then I was
remanded to the Bench at Nomah where Mr Hood and some of the other
witnesses were to appear So away we started for another journey Goring
and a trooper went with me and all sorts of care was taken that I
didnt give them the slip on the road Goring used to put one of my
handcuffs on his own wrist at night so there wasnt much chance of
moving without waking him I had an old horse to ride that couldnt go
much faster than I could run for fear of accident It was even betting
that hed fall and kill me on the road If Id had a laugh in me I
should have had a joke against the Police Department for not keeping
safer horses for their prisoners to ride They keep them till they
havent a leg to stand upon and long after they cant go a hundred
yards without trying to walk on their heads theyre thought good enough
to carry packs and prisoners

Some day Goring said one of those old screws will be the death of
a prisoner before hes committed for trial and then therell be a row
over it I suppose

We hadnt a bad journey of it on the whole The troopers were civil
enough and gave me a glass of grog now and then when they had one
themselves Theyd done their duty in catching me and that was all they
thought about What came afterwards wasnt their lookout Ive no call
to have any bad feeling against the police and I dont think most men
of my sort have Theyve got their work to do like other people and as
long as they do what theyre paid for and dont go out of their way
to harass men for spite we dont bear them any malice If ones hit
in fair fight its the fortune of war What our side dont like is men
going in for police duty thats not in their line Thats interfering
according to our notions and if they fall into a trap or are met
with when they dont expect it they get it pretty hot Theyve only
themselves to thank for it

Goring I could see by his ways had been a swell something like
Starlight A good many young fellows that dont drop into fortunes when
they come out here take to the police in Australia and very good men
they make They like the halfsoldiering kind of life and if they
stick steady at their work and show pluck and gumption they mostly
get promoted Goring was a real smart dashing chap a good rider for an
Englishman that is he could set most horses and hold his own with us
natives anywhere but through scrub and mountain country No man can ride
there I dont care who he is the same as we can unless hes been at
it all his life There we have the pullnot that it is so much after
all But give a native a good horse and thick country and hell lose
any man living thats tackled the work after hes grown up

By and by we got to Nomah a regular hot hole of a place with a log
lockup I was stuck in of course and had legirons put on for fear I
should get out as another fellow had done a few weeks back Starlight
and Warrigal hadnt reached yet they had farther to come The trial
couldnt come till the Quarter Sessions January and February too
passed over and all this time I was mewed up in a bit of a place enough
to stifle a man in the burning weather we had

I heard afterwards that they wanted to bring some of the cattle over so
as Mr Hood could swear to em being his property But he said he could
only swear to its being his brand that he most likely had never set
eyes on them in his life and couldnt swear on his own knowledge that
they hadnt been sold like lots of others by his manager So
this looked like a hitch as juries wont bring a man in guilty of
cattlestealing unless theres clear swearing that the animals he sold
were the property of the prosecutor and known by him to be such

Mr Hood had to go all the way to Adelaide himself and they told me we
might likely have got out of it all only for the imported bull When
he saw him he said he could swear to him point blank brand or no brand
Hed no brand on him of course when he left England but Hood happened
to be in Sydney when he came out and at the station when he came up He
was stabled for the first six months so he used to go and look him over
every day and tell visitors what a pot of money hed cost till he
knew every hair in his tail as the saying is As soon as he seen him
in Adelaide he said he could swear to him as positive as he could to
his favourite riding horse So he was brought over in a steamer from
Adelaide and then drove all the way up to Nomah I wished hed broken
his neck before we ever saw him

Next thing I saw was Starlight being brought in handcuffed between
two troopers and looking as if hed ridden a long way He was just as
easygoing and devilmaycare as ever He said to one of the troopers

Here we are at last and Im deuced glad of it Its perfectly
monstrous you fellows havent better horses You ought to make me
remount agent and Id show you the sort of horses that ought to be
bought for police service Let me have a glass of beer thats a good
fellow before Im locked up I suppose theres no tap worth speaking of
inside

The constable laughed and had one brought to him

It will be some time before you get another captain Heres a long one
for you make the most of it

Where in the devils name is that Warrigal I thought to myself Has
he given them the slip He had as it turned out He had slipped the
handcuffs over his slight wrists and small hands bided his time and
then dashed into a scrub There he was at home They rode and rode but
Warrigal was gone like a rock wallaby It was a good while before he was
as near the gaol again

All this time Id been wondering how it was they came to drop on our
names so pat and to find out that Jim and I had a share in the Momberah
cattle racket All they could have known was that we left the back of
Boree at a certain day and that was nothing seeing that for all they
knew we might have gone away to new country or anywhere The more I
looked at it the more I felt sure that some one had given to the
police information about ussomebody who was in it and knew all about
everything It wasnt Starlight We could have depended our life on him
It might have been one of the other chaps but I couldnt think of any
one except Warrigal He would do anything in the world to spite me
and Jim I knew but then he couldnt hurt us without drawing the net
tighter round Starlight Sooner than hurt a hair of his head hed have
put his hand into the fire and kept it there I knew that from things
Id seen him do

Starlight and I hadnt much chance of a talk but we managed to get news
from each other a bit at a time that can always be managed We were to
be defended and a lawyer fetched all the way from Sydney to fight our
case for us The money was there Father managed the other part of it
through people he had that did every kind of work for him so when the
judge came up we should have a show for it

The weary long summer daysevery one of them about twenty hours
longcame to an end somehow or other It was so hot and close and I
was that miserable I had two minds to knock my brains out and finish
the whole thing I couldnt settle to read as I did afterwards I was
always wishing and wondering when Id hear some news from home and none
ever came Nomah was a bit of a place where hardly anybody did anything
but idle and drink and spend money when they had it When they had none
they went away There wasnt even a place to take exercise in and the
legirons I wore night and day began to eat into my flesh I wasnt used
to them in those days I could feel them in my heart too Last of all I
got ill and for a while was so weak and low they thought I was going to
get out of the trial altogether

At last we heard that the judge and all his lot were on the road and
would be up in a few days We were almost as glad when the news came
as if we were sure of being let off One day they did come and all the
little town was turned upside down The judge stopped at one hotel they
told us the lawyers at another Then the witnesses in ours and other
cases came in from all parts and made a great difference especially
to the publicans The jurors were summoned and had to come unless they
had a fancy for being fined Most of this I heard from the constables
they seemed to think it was the only thing that made any difference
in their lives Last of all I heard that Mr Hood had come and the
imported bull and some other witnesses

There were some small cases first and then we were brought out
Starlight and I and put in the dock The court was crammed and crowded
every soul within a hundred miles seemed to have come in there never
were so many people in the little courthouse before Starlight was
quietly dressed and looked as if he was there by mistake Anybody would
have thought so the way he lounged and stared about as if he thought
there was something very curious and hard to understand about the whole
thing I was so weak and ill that I couldnt stand up and after a while
the judge told me to sit down and Starlight too Starlight made a most
polite bow and thanked his Honour as he called him Then the jury
were called up and our lawyer began his work He stood alongside of
Starlight and whispered something to him after which Starlight stood
up and about every second man called out Challenge then that juror
had to go down It took a good while to get our jury all together Our
lawyer seemed very particular about the sort of jury he was satisfied
with and when they did manage to get twelve at last they were not the
bestlooking men in the court by a very long way

The trial had to go on and then the Crown Prosecutor made a speech in
which he talked about the dishonesty which was creeping unchecked over
the land and the atrocious villainy of criminals who took a thousand
head of cattle in one lot and made out the country was sure to go to
destruction if we were not convicted He said that unfortunately they
were not in a position to bring many of the cattle back that had been
taken to another colony but one remarkable animal was as good for
purposes of evidence as a hundred Such an animal he would produce
and he would not trespass on the patience of jurors and gentlemen in
attendance any longer but call his first witness

John Dawson sworn Was head stockman and cattle manager at Momberah
knew the back country and in a general way the cattle running there
was not out much in the winter the ground was boggy and the cattle
were hardly ever mustered till spring when he did go with some other
stockriders he saw at once that a large number of the Momberah cattle
branded HOD and other brands were missing went to Adelaide a few
months after saw a large number of cattle of the HOD brand which he
was told had been sold by the prisoner now before the court and known
as Starlight and others to certain farmers he could swear that the
cattle he saw bore Mr Hoods brand could not swear that he recognised
them as having been at Momberah in his charge believed so but could
not swear it he had seen a shorthorn bull outside of the court this
morning he last saw the said bull at the station of Messrs Fordham
Brothers near Adelaide they made a communication to him concerning the
bull he would and could swear to the identity of the animal with the
Fifteenth Duke of Cambridge an imported shorthorn bull the property
of Mr Hood had seen him before that at Momberah knew that Mr Hood
had bought said bull in Sydney and was at Momberah when he was sent up
could not possibly be mistaken when he saw the bull at Momberah nine
months since he had a small brand like H on the shoulder Mr Hood put
it on in witnesss presence it was a horsebrand now it resembled JE
the brand had been faked or cleverly altered witness could see the
original brand quite plain underneath as far as he knew Mr Hood never
sold or gave any one authority to take the animal he had missed him
some months since and always believed he had strayed knew the bull to
be a valuable animal worth several hundred pounds

We had one bit of luck in having to be tried in an outoftheway place
like Nomah It was a regular outside bush township and though the
distance oughtnt to have much to say to peoples honesty youll mostly
find that these farout backofbeyond places have got men and women to
match em

Except the squatters and overseers the other peoples mostly a shady
lot Somes run away from places that were too hot to hold em
The women aint the mens wives that they live with but somebody
elseswhos well rid of em too if all was known Theres most likely
a bit of horse and cattle stealing done on the quiet and the publicans
and storekeepers know who are their best customers the square people
or the cross ones It aint so easy to get a regular upanddown
straightahead jury in a place of this sort So Starlight and I knew
that our chance was a lot better than if wed been tried at Bargo or
Dutton Forest or any steadygoing places of that sort

If wed made up our minds from the first that we were to get into it
it wouldnt have been so bad wed have known we had to bear it Now we
might get out of it and what a thing it would be to feel free again
and walk about in the sun without any one having the right to stop you
Almost that isthere were other things against us but there wasnt
so much of a chance of their turning up This was the great stake If we
won we were as good as made I felt ready to swear Id go home and never
touch a shilling that didnt come honest again If we lost it seemed
as if everything was so much the worse and blacker than it looked at
first just for this bit of hope and comfort

After the bull had been sworn to by Mr Hood and another witness they
brought up some more evidence as they called it about the other cattle
we had sold in Adelaide They had fetched some of the farmers up that
had been at the sale They swore straight enough to having bought cattle
with certain brands from Starlight They didnt know of course at the
time whose they were but they could describe the brands fast enough
There was one fellow that couldnt read nor write but he remembered all
the brands about a dozen in the pen of steers he bought and described
them one by one One brand he said was like a longhandled shovel It
turned out to beD  TDTom Dawsons of Mungeree About a hundred of
his were in the mob They had drawn back for Mungeree as was nearly all
frontage and cold in the winter He was the worst witness for us of the
lot very near Hed noticed everything and forgot nothing

Do you recognise either of the prisoners in the dock he was asked

Yes both of em says he I wish I could have got at him I see the
swell chap firsthim as made out he was the owner and gammoned all
the Adelaide gentlemen so neat There was a halfcaste chap with him as
followed him about everywhere then there was another man as didnt talk
much but seemed by letting down sliprails and what not to be in it
I heard this Starlight as he calls hisself now say to him You
have everything ready to break camp by ten oclock and Ill be there
tomorrow and square up I thought he meant to pay their wages I never
dropped but what they was his menhis hired servantsas he was going
to pay off or send back

Will you swear our lawyer says that the younger prisoner is the man
you saw at Adelaide with the cattle

Yes Ill swear I looked at him pretty sharp and nothing aint likely
to make me forget him Hes the man and that Ill swear to

Were there not other people there with the cattle

Yes there was an oldish very quiet but determinedlike manhe had a
stunnin dorg with himand a young man something like this gentlemanI
mean the prisoner I didnt see the other young man nor the halfcaste
in court

Thats all very well says our lawyer very fierce but will you
swear sir that the prisoner Marston took any charge or ownership of
the cattle

No I cant says the chap I see him a drafting em in the morning
and he seemed to know all the brands and so on but he done no more
than Ive seen hired servants do over and over again

The other witnesses had done when some one called out Herbert
Falkland and Mr Falkland steps into the court He walks in quiet and
a little proud he couldnt help feeling it but he didnt show it in
his ways and talk as little as any man I ever saw

Hes asked by the Crown Prosecutor if hes seen the bull outside of the
court this day

Yes he has seen him

Has he ever seen him before

Never to his knowledge

He doesnt then know the name of his former owner

Has heard generally that he belonged to Mr Hood of Momberah but does
not know it of his own knowledge

Has he ever seen or does he know either of the prisoners

Knows the younger prisoner who has been in the habit of working for
him in various ways

When was prisoner Marston working for him last

He with his brother James who rendered his family a service he
shall never forget was working for him after last shearing for some
months

Where were they working

At an outstation at the back of the run

When did they leave

About April or May last

Was it known to you in what direction they proceeded after leaving your
service

I have no personal knowledge I should think it improper to quote
hearsay

Had they been settled up with for their former work

No there was a balance due to them

To what amount

About twenty pounds each was owing

Did you not think it curious that ordinary labourers should leave so
large a sum in your hands

It struck me as unusual but I did not attach much weight to the
circumstance I thought they would come back and ask for it before the
next shearing I am heartily sorry that they did not do so and regret
still more deeply that two young men worthy of a better fate should have
been arraigned on such a charge

One moment Mr Falkland says our counsel as they call them and
a firstrate counsellor ours was If wed been as innocent as two
schoolgirls he couldnt have done more for us Did the prisoner Marston
work well and conduct himself properly while in your employ

No man better says Mr Falkland looking over to me with that pitying
kind of look in his eyes as made me feel what a fool and rogue Id been
ten times worse than anything else No man better he and his brother
were in many respects according to my overseers report the most
hardworking and bestconducted labourers in the establishment




Chapter 18



Mr Runnimall the auctioneer swore that the older prisoner placed
certain cattle in his hands to arrive for sale in the usual way
stating that his name was Mr Charles Carisforth and that he had
several stations in other colonies Had no reason for doubting him
Prisoner was then very well dressed was gentlemanly in his manners and
came to his office with a young gentleman of property whom he knew well
The cattle were sold in the usual way for rather high prices as the
market was good The proceeds in cash were paid over to the prisoner
whom he now knew by the name of Starlight He accounted for there being
an unusual number of brands by saying publicly at the sale that
the station had been used as a depot for other runs of his and the
remainder lots of store cattle kept there

He had seen a shorthorn bull outside of the court this day branded
JE on the shoulder He identified him as one of the cattle placed in
his hands for sale by the prisoner Starlight He sold and delivered him
according to instructions He subsequently handed over the proceeds to
the said prisoner He included the purchase money in a cheque given for
the bull and other cattle sold on that day He could swear positively to
the bull he was a remarkable animal He had not the slightest doubt as
to his identity

Had he seen the prisoner Marston when the cattle were sold now alleged
to belong to Mr Hood

Yes he was confident that prisoner was there with some other men whom
he witness did not particularly remark He helped to draft the cattle
and to put them in pens on the morning of the sale

Was he prepared to swear that prisoner Marston was not a hired servant
of prisoner Starlight

No he could not swear He had no way of knowing what the relations
were between the two They were both in the robbery he could see that

How could you see that said our lawyer Have you never seen a paid
stockman do all that you saw prisoner Marston do

Well I have but somehow I fancy this man was different

We have nothing to do with your fancies sir says our man mighty
hot as he turns upon him you are here to give evidence as to facts
not as to what you fancy Have you any other grounds for connecting
prisoner Marston with the robbery in question

No he had not

You can go down sir and I only wish you may live to experience some
of the feelings which fill the breasts of persons who are unjustly
convicted

     

This about ended the trial There was quite enough proved for a moderate
dose of transportation A quiet oldishlooking man got up now and came
forward to the witnessbox I didnt know who he was but Starlight
nodded to him quite pleasant He had a short closetrimmed beard and
was one of those nothingparticularlooking old chaps Im blessed if
I could have told what he was He might have been a merchant or a
squatter or a head clerk or a wine merchant or a broker or lived in
the town or lived in the country any of halfadozen trades would suit
him The only thing that was out of the common was his eyes They had a
sort of curious way of looking at you as if he wondered whether you was
speaking true and yet seein nothing and tellin nothing He regular
took in Starlight he told me afterwards by always talking about the
China Seas hed been there it seems hed been everywhere hed last
come from America he didnt say hed gone there to collar a clerk that
had run off with two or three thousand pounds and to be ready to meet
him as he stepped ashore

Anyhow hed watched Starlight in Canterbury when he was riding and
flashing about and had put such a lot of things together that he took a
passage in the same boat with him to Melbourne Why didnt he arrest him
in New Zealand Because he wasnt sure of his man It was from something
Starlight let out on board ship He told me himself afterwards that
he made sure of his being the man he wanted so he steps into the
witnessbox very quiet and respectablelooking with his white
waistcoat and silk coatit was hot enough to fry beefsteaks on the roof
of the courthouse that dayand looks about him The Crown Prosecutor
begins with him as civil as you please

My name is Stephen Stillbrook I am a sergeant of detective police
in the service of the Government of New South Wales From information
received I proceeded to Canterbury in New Zealand about the month
of September last I saw there the older prisoner who was living at a
firstclass hotel in Christchurch He was moving in good society and
was apparently possessed of ample means He frequently gave expensive
entertainments which were attended by the leading inhabitants and high
officials of the place I myself obtained an introduction to him and
partook of his hospitality on several occasions I attempted to draw him
out in conversation about New South Wales but he was cautious and
gave me to understand that he had been engaged in large squatting
transactions in another colony From his general bearing and from the
character of his associates I came to the belief that he was not the
individual named in the warrant and determined to return to Sydney
I was informed that he had taken his passage to Melbourne in a mail
steamer From something which I one day heard his halfcaste servant
say who being intoxicated was speaking carelessly I determined to
accompany them to Melbourne My suspicions were confirmed on the voyage
As we went ashore at the pier at Sandridge I accosted him I said I
arrest you on suspicion of having stolen a herd of cattle the property
of Walter Hood of Momberah Prisoner was very cool and polite just as
any other gentleman would be and asked me if I did not think Id made
a most ridiculous mistake The other passengers began to laugh as if
it was the best joke in the world Starlight never moved a muscle Ive
seen a good many cool hands in my time but I never met any one like
him I had given notice to one of the Melbourne police as he came
aboard and he arrested the halfcaste known as Warrigal I produced a
warrant the one now before the court which is signed by a magistrate
of the territory of New South Wales

The witnessing part was all over It took the best part of the day
and there we were all the time standing up in the dock with the court
crammed with people staring at us I dont say that it felt as bad as it
might have done nigh home Most of the Nomah people looked upon fellows
stealing cattle or horses in small lots or big just like most people
look at boys stealing fruit out of an orchard or as they used to talk
of smugglers on the English coast as Ive heard father tell of Any man
might take a turn at that sort of thing now and then and not be such a
bad chap after all It was the duty of the police to catch him If they
caught him well and good it was so much the worse for him if they
didnt that was their lookout It wasnt anybody elses business
anyhow And a man that wasnt caught or that got turned up at his
trial was about as good as the general run of people and there was no
reason for any one to look shy at him

After the witnesses had said all they knew our lawyer got up and made a
stunning speech He made us out such firstrate chaps that it looked as
if we ought to get off flying He blew up the squatters in a general way
for taking all the country and not giving the poor man a chancefor
neglecting their immense herds of cattle and suffering them to roam
all over the country putting temptation in the way of poor people and
causing confusion and recklessness of all kinds Some of these cattle
are never seen from the time they are branded till they are mustered
every two or three years apparently They stray away hundreds of
milesprobably a thousandwho is to know Possibly they are sold It
was admitted by the prosecutor that he had sold 10000 head of cattle
during the last six years and none had been rebranded to his knowledge
What means had he of knowing whether these cattle that so much was said
about had not been legally sold before It was a most monstrous thing
that men like his clientsmen who were an honour to the land they lived
inshould be dragged up to the very centre of the continent upon
a paltry charge like thisa charge which rested upon the flimsiest
evidence it had ever been his good fortune to demolish

With regard to the socalled imported bull the case against his clients
was apparently stronger but he placed no reliance upon the statements
of the witnesses who averred that they knew him so thoroughly that they
could not be deceived in him He distrusted their evidence and believed
the jury would distrust it too The brand was as different as possible
from the brand seen to have been on the beast originally One shorthorn
was very like another He would not undertake to swear positively in
any such case and he implored the jury as men of the world as men
of experience in all transactions relating to stock here some of the
people in the court grinned to dismiss from their minds everything
of the nature of prejudice and looking solely at the miserable
incomplete unsatisfactory nature of the evidence to acquit the
prisoners

It sounded all very pleasant after everything before had been so rough
on our feelings and the jury looked as if theyd more than half made up
their minds to let us off

Then the judge put on his glasses and began to go all over the evidence
very grave and steady like and read bits out of the notes which hed
taken very careful all the time Judges dont have such an easy time of
it as some people thinks they have Ive often wondered as they take so
much trouble and works away so patient trying to find out the rights
and wrongs of things for people that they never saw before and wont
see again However they try to do their best all as Ive ever seen
and they generally get somewhere near the right and justice of things
So the judge began and readwent over the evidence bit by bit and laid
it all out before the jury so as they couldnt but see it where it told
against us and again where it was a bit in our favour

As for the main body of the cattle he made out that there was strong
grounds for thinking as wed taken and sold them at Adelaide and had
the money too The making of a stockyard at the back of Momberah was not
the thing honest men would do But neither of us prisoners had been seen
there There was no identification of the actual cattle branded HOD
alleged to have been stolen nor could Mr Hood swear positively that
they were his cattle had never been sold and were a portion of his
herd It was in the nature of these cases that identification of live
stock roaming over the immense solitudes of the interior should be
difficult occasionally impossible Yet he trusted that the jury
would give full weight to all the circumstances which went to show a
continuous possession of the animals alleged to be stolen The persons
of both prisoners had been positively sworn to by several witnesses as
having been seen at the sale of the cattle referred to They were both
remarkablelooking men and such as if once seen would be retained in
the memory of the beholder

But the most important piece of evidence here the judge stopped
and took a pinch of snuff was that afforded by the shorthorn bull
Fifteenth Duke of Cambridgehe had been informed that was his name
That animal in the first place was sworn to most positively by Mr
Hood and claimed as his property Other credible witnesses testified
also to his identity and corroborated the evidence of Mr Hood in all
respects the ownership and identity of the animal are thus established
beyond all doubt

Then there was the auctioneer Mr Runnimall who swore that this animal
had been with other cattle placed in his hands for sale by the older
prisoner The bull is accordingly sold publicly by him and in the
prisoners presence He subsequently receives from the witness the
price about 270 Pounds for which the bull was sold The younger
prisoner was there at the same time and witnessed the sale of the bull
and other cattle giving such assistance as would lead to the conclusion
that he was concerned in the transaction

He did not wish to reflect upon this or any other jury but he could
not help recalling the fact that a jury in that town once committed the
unpardonable fault the crime he had almost said of refusing to find
a prisoner guilty against whom well confirmed evidence had been brought
It had been his advice to the Minister for Justice so glaring was
the miscarriage of justice to which he referred that the whole of the
jurymen who had sat upon that trial should be struck off the roll This
was accordingly done

He the judge was perfectly convinced in his own mind that no
impropriety of this sort was likely to be committed by the intelligent
respectable jury whom he saw before him but it was his duty to warn
them that in his opinion they could not bring in any verdict but
Guilty if they respected their oaths He should leave the case
confidently in their hands again impressing upon them that they could
only find one verdict if they believed the evidence

     

The jury all went out Then another case was called on and a fresh jury
sworn in for to try it We sat in the dock The judge told Starlight he
might sit down and we waited till they came back I really believe that
waiting is the worst part of the whole thing the bitterest part of
the punishment Ive seen men when they were being tried for their
liveshavent I done it and gone through it myselfwaiting there an
hourtwo hours half through the night not knowing whether they was to
be brought in guilty or not What a hell they must have gone through
in that timedoubt and dread hope and fear wretchedness and despair
over and over and over again No wonder some of em cant stand it but
keeps twitching and shifting and getting paler and turning faint when
the jury comes back and they think they see one thing or the other
written in their faces Ive seen a strong man drop down like a dead
body when the judge opened his mouth to pass sentence on him Ive seen
em faint too when the foreman of the jury said Not guilty One
chap he was an innocent upcountry fellow in for his first bit of
duffing like we was once he covered his face with his hands when he
found he was let off and cried like a child All sorts and kinds of
different ways men takes it I was in court once when the judge asked
a man whod just been found guilty if hed anything to say why he
shouldnt pass sentence of death upon him Hed killed a woman cut her
throat and a regular right down cruel murder it was only men ll
kill women and one another too for some causes as long as the world
lasts and he just leaned over the dock rails as if hed been going to
get three months and said cool and quiet No your Honour not as I
know of Hed made up his mind to it from the first you see and that
makes all the difference He knew he hadnt the ghost of a chance to
get out of it and when his time came he faced it I remember seeing his
worst enemy come into the court and sit and look at him then just to
see how he took it but he didnt make the least sign That man couldnt
have told whether he seen him or not

Starlight and I wasnt likely to break downnot muchwhatever the jury
did or the judge said All the same after an hour had passed and we
still waiting there it began to be a sickening kind of feeling The day
had been all taken up with the evidence and the rest of the trial all
long dragging hours of a hot summers day The sun had been blazing
away all day on the iron roof of the courthouse and the red dust of the
streets that lay inches deep for a mile all round the town The flies
buzzed all over the courthouse and round and round while the lawyers
talked and wrangled with each other and still the trial went on
Witness after witness was called and crossexamined and bullied and
confused and contradicted till he was afraid to say what he knew or what
he didnt know I began to think it must be some kind of performance
that would go on for ever and never stop and the day and it never could
end

At last the sun came shining level with the lower window and we knew
it was getting late After a while the twilight began to get dimmer
and grayer There isnt much out there when the sun goes down Then the
judge ordered the lamps to be lighted

Just at that time the bailiff came forward

Your Honour the jury has agreed I felt my teeth shut hard but I
made no move or sign I looked over at Starlight He yawned He did as
Im alive

I wish to heaven theyd make more haste he said quietly his Honour
and we are both being done out of our dinners

I said nothing I was looking at the foremans face I thought I knew
the word he was going to say and that word was Guilty Sure enough I
didnt hear anything more for a bit I dont mind owning that Most men
feel that way the first time There was a sound like rushing waters in
my ears and the courthouse and the people all swam before my eyes

The first I heard was Starlights voice again just as cool and
leisurely as ever I never heard any difference in it and Ive known
him speak in a lot of different situations If you shut your eyes you
couldnt tell from the tone of his voice whether he was fighting for his
life or asking you to hand him the salt When he said the hardest and
fiercest thingand he could be hard and fiercehe didnt raise his
voice he only seemed to speak more distinct like His eyes were worse
than his voice at such times There werent many men that liked to look
back at him much less say anything

Now he said That means five years of Berrima Dick if not seven Its
cooler than these infernal logs thats one comfort

I said nothing I couldnt joke My throat was dry and I felt hot and
cold by turns I thought of the old hut by the creek and could see
mother sitting rocking herself and crying out loud and Aileen with
a set dull look on her face as if shed never speak or smile again I
thought of the days months years that were to pass under lock and key
with irons and shame and solitude all for company I wondered if the
place where they shut up mad people was like a gaol and why we were not
sent there instead

I heard part of what the judge said but not allbits here and there
The jury had brought in a most righteous verdict just what he should
have expected from the effect of the evidence upon an intelligent
wellprincipled Nomah jury We heard afterwards that they were six to
six and then agreed to toss up how the verdict was to go The crime
of cattle and horse stealing had assumed gigantic proportions Sheep as
yet appeared to be safe but then there were not very many within a few
hundred miles of Nomah It appeared to him that the prisoner known as
Starlight though from old police records his real name appeared to
be

Here he drew himself up and faced the judge in defiance Then like
lightning he seemed to change and said

Your Honour I submit that it can answer no good purpose to disclose my
alleged name There are othersI do not speak for myself

The judge stopped a bit then hesitated Starlight bowed I do
notaknow whether there is any necessity to make public a name
which many years since was not better known than honoured I say
theaprisoner known as Starlight has from the evidence taken
the principal part in this nefarious transaction It is not the first
offence as I observe from a paper I hold in my hand The younger
prisoner Marston has very properly been found guilty of criminal
complicity with the same offence It may be that he has been concerned
in other offences against the law but of that we have no proof before
this court He has not been previously convicted I do not offer advice
to the elder criminal his own heart and conscience the promptings of
which I assume to be dulled not obliterated I feel convinced have
said more to him in the way of warning condemnation and remorse than
could the most impressive rebuke the most solemn exhortation from a
judicial bench But to the younger man to him whose vigorous frame
has but lately attained the full development of early manhood I feel
compelled to appeal with all the weight which age and experience may
lend I adjure him to accept the warning which the sentence I am about
to pass will convey to him to endure his confinement with submission
and repentance and to lead during his remaining years which may be
long and comparatively peaceful the free and necessarily happy life
of an honest man The prisoner Starlight is sentenced to seven years
imprisonment the prisoner Richard Marston to five years imprisonment
both in Berrima Gaol

I heard the door of the dock unclose with a snap We were taken out I
hardly knew how I walked like a man in his sleep Five years Berrima
Gaol Berrima Gaol kept ringing in my ears

The day was done the stars were out as we moved across from the
courthouse to the lockup The air was fresh and cool The sun had gone
down so had the sun of our lives never to rise again

Morning came Why did it ever come again I thought What did we want
but nightblack as our heartsdark as our fatedismal as the death
which likely would come quick as a living tomb and the sooner the
better Mind you I only felt this way the first time All men do I
suppose that havent been born in gaols and workhouses Afterwards they
take a more everyday view of things

Youre young and soft Dick Starlight said to me as we were rumbling
along in the coach next day with hand and legirons on and a trooper
opposite to us Why dont I feel like it My good fellow I have felt
it all before But if you sear your flesh or your horses with a redhot
iron youll find the flesh hard and callous ever after My heart was
seared onceay twiceand deeply too I have no heart now or if I
ever feel at all its for a horse I wonder how old Rainbow gets on

You were sorry father let us come in the first time I said How do
you account for that if youve no heart

Really Well listen Richard Did I If you guillotine a mancut off
his head as they do in France with an axe that falls like the
monkey of a piledriverthe limbs quiver and stretch and move almost
naturally for a good while afterwards Ive seen the performance
more than once So I suppose the internal arrangements immediately
surrounding my heart must have performed some kind of instinctive motion
in your case and Jims By the way where the deuce has Jim been all
this time Clever James

Better ask Evans here if the police knows It is not for want of trying
if they dont

By the Lord Harry no said the trooper a young man who saw no reason
not to be sociable Its the most surprisin thing out where hes got
to Theyve been all round him reglar cordonlike and he must have
disappeared into the earth or gone up in a balloon to get away




Chapter 19



It took us a weeks travelling or more to get to Berrima Sometimes
we were all night in the coach as well as all day There were other
passengers in the coach with us Two or three bushmen a station
overseer with his wife and daughter a Chinaman and a lunatic that had
come from Nomah too I think its rough on the public to pack madmen
and convicts in irons in the same coach with them But it saves the
Government a good deal of money and the people dont seem to care They
stand it anyhow

We would have made a bolt of it if wed had a chance but we never had
night nor day not half a one The police were civil but they never
left us and slept by us at night That is one watched while the
other slept We began to sleep soundly ourselves and to have a better
appetite Going through the fresh air had something to do with it I
daresay And then there was no anxiety We had played for a big stake
and lost Now we had to pay and make the best of it It was the tenth
day there were no railways then to shorten the journey when we drove
up to the big gate and looked at the high walls and dark heavy lines of
Berrima Gaol the largest the most severe the most dreaded of all the
prisons in New South Wales It had leaked out the day before somehow
that the famous Starlight and the other prisoner in the great Momberah
cattle robbery were to be brought in this particular day There was a
fairsized crowd gathered as we were helped down from the coach At the
side of the crowd was a small mob of blacks with their dogs spears
possum rugs and all complete They and their gins and pickaninnies
appeared to take great notice of the whole thing One tallish gin
darker than the others and with her hair tucked under an old bonnet
wrapped her possum cloak closely round her shoulders and pushed up
close to us She looked hard at Starlight who appeared not to see her
As she drew back some one staggered against her an angry scowl passed
over her face so savage and bitter that I felt quite astonished I
should have been astonished I mean if I had not been able by that
very change to know again the restless eyes and grim set mouth of
Warrigal

It was only a look and he was gone The lock creaked the great iron
door swung back and we were swallowed up in a tomba stone vault where
men are none the less buried because they have separate cells They
do not live though they appear to be alive they move and sometimes
speak and appear to hear words Some have to be sent away and buried
outside They have been dead a long time but have not seemed to want
putting in the ground That makes no change in themnot much I mean
If they sleep its all right if they dont sleep anything must be
happiness after the life they have escaped Happy are the dead is
written on all prison walls

What I suffered in that first time no tongue can tell I cant bear now
to think of it and put it down The solitary part of it was enough to
drive any man mad that had been used to a free life Day after day
night after night the same and the same and the same over again

Then the dark cells I got into them for a bit I wasnt always as cool
as I might bemore times that mad with myself that I could have smashed
my own skull against the wall let alone any one elses There was one
of the warders I took a dislike to from the first and he to me I dont
doubt I thought he was rough and surly He thought I wanted to have my
own way and he made it up to take it out of me and run me every way
he could We had a goodish spell of fighting over it but he gave in at
last Not but what Id had a lot to bear and took a deal of punishment
before he jacked up I neednt have had it It was all my own obstinacy
and a sort of dogged feeling that made me feel I couldnt give in I
believe it done me good though I do really think I should have gone
mad else thinking of the dreadful long months and years that lay before
me without a chance of getting out

Sometimes Id take a low fit and refuse my food and very near give up
living altogether The least bit more and Id have died outright One
day there was a party of ladies and gentlemen came to be shown over the
gaol There was a lot of us passing into the exercise yard I happened
to look up for a minute and saw one of the ladies looking steadily at
us and oh what a pitying look there was in her face In a moment I saw
it was Miss Falkland and by the change that came into her face that
she knew me again altered as I was I wondered how she could have known
me I was a differentlooking chap from when she had seen me last With
a beastly yellowgray suit of prison clothes his face scraped smooth
every day like a freshkilled pig and the look of a free man gone out
of his face for everhow any woman gentle or simple ever can know a
man in gaol beats me Whether or no she knew me I suppose she saw the
likeness to Jim and she told him true enough shed never forget him
nor what hed done for her

I just looked at her and turned my head away I felt as if Id make a
fool of myself if I didnt All the depth down that Id fallen since I
was shearing there at Boree rushed into my mind at once I nearly fell
down I know I was pretty weak and low then Id only just come out of
the doctors hands

I was passing along with the rest of the mob I heard her voice quite
clear and firm but soft and sweet too How sweet it sounded to me
then

I wish to speak a few words to the third prisoner in the linethe tall
one Can I do so Captain Wharton

Oh certainly Miss Falkland said the old gentleman who had brought
them all in to look at the wonderful neat garden and the baths and the
hospital and the unnatural washedup sweptup barracks that make the
cleanest gaol feel worse than the roughest hut He was the visiting
magistrate and took a deal of interest in the place and believed he
knew all the prisoners like a book Oh certainly my dear young lady
Is Richard Marston an acquaintance of yours

He and his brother worked for my father at Boree she said quite
stately His brother saved my life

I was called back by the warder Miss Falkland stepped out before them
all and shook hands with me Yes SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME and the
tears came into her eyes as she did so

If anything could have given a mans heart a turn the right way that
would have done it I felt again as if some one cared for me in the
world as if I had a soul worth saving And people may talk as they
like but when a man has the notion that everybody has given him up as
a bad job and has dropped troubling themselves about him he gets worse
and worse and meets the devil halfway

She said

Richard Marston I cannot tell how grieved I am to see you here Both
papa and I were so sorry to hear all about those Momberah cattle

I stammered out something or other I hardly knew what

She looked at me again with her great beautiful eyes like a wondering
child

Is your brother here too

No Miss Falkland I said Theyve never caught Jim yet and whats
more I dont think they will He jumped on a barebacked horse without
saddle or bridle and got clear

She looked as if she was going to smile but she didnt I saw her eyes
sparkle though and she said softly

Poor Jim so he got away I am glad of that What a wonderful rider he
was But I suppose he will be caught some day Oh I do so wish I could
say anything that would make you repent of what you have done and try
and do better by and by Papa says you have a long life before you most
likely and might do so much with it yet You will try for my sake
wont you now

Ill do what I can miss I said and if I ever see Jim again Ill
tell him of your kindness

Thank you and goodbye she said and she held out her hand again and
took mine I walked away but I couldnt help holding my head higher
and feeling a different man somehow

I aint much of a religious chap wasnt then and I am farther off it
now than ever but Ive heard a power of the Bible and all that read
in my time and when the parson read out next Sunday about Jesus Christ
dying for men and wanting to have their souls saved I felt as if I
could have a show of understanding it better than I ever did before If
Id been a Catholic like Aileen and mother I should have settled what
the Virgin Mary was like when she was alive and never said a prayer to
her without thinking of Miss Falkland

While I was dying one week and getting over it another and going
through all the misery every fellow has in his first year of gaol
Starlight was just his old self all the time He took it quite easy
never gave any one trouble and there wasnt a soul in the place that
wouldnt have done anything for him The visiting magistrate thought his
a most interesting case and believed in his heart that he had been the
means of turning him from the error of his wayshe and the chaplain
between them anyhow He even helped him to be allowed to be kept a
little separate from the other prisoners lest they should contaminate
him and in lots of ways made his life a bit easier to him

It was reported about that it was not the first time that he had been
in a gaol That hed done time as they call it in another colony
He might or he might not He never said And he wasnt the man with all
his soft ways youd like to ask about such a thing

By the look of it you wouldnt think he cared about it a bit He took it
very easy read half his time and had no sign about him that he wasnt
perfectly satisfied He intended when he got out to lead a new life the
chaplain said and be the means of keeping other men right and straight

One day we had a chance of a word together He got the soft side of
the chaplain who thought he wanted to convert me and take me out of my
sulky and obstinate state of mind He took good care that we were not
overheard or watched and then said rather loud for fear of accidents

Well Richard how are you feeling I am happy to say that I have been
led to think seriously of my former evil ways and I have made up my
mind besides to use every effort in my power to clear out of this
infernal collection of tombstones when the moon gets dark again about
the end of this month

How have you taken to become religious I said Are you quite sure
that what you say can be depended upon And when did you get the good
news

I have had many doubts in my mind for a long time he said and have
watched and prayed long and listened for the word that was to come
and the end of it is that I have at length heard the news that makes
the soul rejoice even for the heathen the boy Warrigal who will be
waiting outside these walls with fresh horses I must now leave you
my dear Richard he said and I hope my words will have made an
impression on you When I have more to communicate for your good I will
ask leave to return

After I heard this news I began to live again Was there a chance of our
getting out of this terrible tomb into the free air and sunshine once
more However it was to be managed I could not make out I trusted
mostly to Starlight who seemed to know everything and to be quite easy
about the way it would all turn out

All that I could get out of him afterwards was that on a certain night a
man would be waiting with two horses outside of the gaol wall and that
if we had the luck to get out safe and he thought we should we would
be on their backs in three minutes and all the police in New South
Wales wouldnt catch us once we got five minutes start

This was all very well if it came out right but there was an awful lot
to be done before we were even near it The more I began to think over
it the worse it looked sometimes I quite lost heart and believed we
should never have half a chance of carrying out our plan

We knew from the other prisoners that men had tried from time to time
to get away Three had been caught One had been shot deadhe was
luckyanother had fallen off the wall and broke his leg Two had got
clear off and had never been heard of since

We were all locked up in our cells every evening and at five oclock
too We didnt get out till six in the morning a long long time Cold
enough in the bitter winter weather that had then come in and a long
weary wretched time to wait and watch for daylight

Well first of all we had to get the cell door open That was the
easiest part of the lot Theres always men in a big gaol that all kinds
of keys and locks are like large print to They can make most locks fly
open like magic whats more theyre willing to do it for anybody
else or show them how It keeps their hand in they have a pleasure in
spiting those above them whenever they can do it

The getting out of the cell was easy enough but there was a lot of
danger after you had got out A passage to cross where the warder
with his rifle walked up and down every halfhour all night then a big
courtyard then another smaller door in the wall then the outer
yard for those prisoners who are allowed to work at stonecutting or
outofdoor trades

After all this there was the great outer wall to climb up and drop down
from on the other side

We managed to pick our night well A French convict who liked that
sort of thing gave me the means of undoing the cell door It was three
oclock in the morning when in winter most people are sleepy that
havent much on their minds The warder that came down the passage
wasnt likely to be asleep but he might have made it up in his mind
that all was right and not taken as much notice as usual This was what
we trusted to Besides we had got a few fivepound notes smuggled in
to us and though I wouldnt say that we were able to bribe any of the
gaolers we didnt do ourselves any harm in one or two little ways by
throwing a few sovereigns about

I did just as I was told by the Frenchman and I opened the cell door as
easy as a wooden latch I had to shut it again for fear the warder would
see it and begin to search and sound the alarm at once Just as Id done
this he came down the passage I had only time to crouch down in the
shadow when he passed me That was right now he would not be back for
halfanhour

I crawled and scrambled and crept along like a snake until little by
little I got to the gate through the last wall but one The lock here
was not so easy as the cell door and took me more time While I stood
there I was in a regular tremble with fright thinking some one might
come up and all my chance would be gone After a bit the lock gave way
and I found myself in the outer yard I went over to the wall and
crept along it till I came to one of the angles There I was to meet
Starlight He was not there and he was to bring some spikes to climb
the wall with and a rope with two or three other things

I waited and waited for halfanhour which seemed a month What was
I to do if he didnt come I could not climb the thirtyfoot wall by
myself One had to be cautious too for there were towers at short
distances along the wall in every one of these a warder armed with
a rifle which he was sure to empty at any one that looked like
gaolbreaking I began to think he had made a mistake in the night
Then that he had been discovered and caught the moment he tried to
get out of the cell I was sure to be caught if he was prevented from
coming and shutting up would be harder to bear than ever

Then I heard a mans step coming up softly I knew it was Starlight I
knew his step and thought I would always tell it from a thousand other
mens it was so light and firm so quick and free Even in a prison it
was different from other mens and I remembered everything he had ever
said about walking and running both of which he was wonderfully good
at

He was just as cool as ever All right Dick take these spikes He
had halfadozen stout bits of iron how ever he got them I know no more
than the dead but there they were and a light strong coil of rope as
well I knew what the spikes were for of course to drive into the
wall between the stones and climb up by With the rope we were to drop
ourselves over the wall the other side It was thirty feet highno fool
of a drop More than one man had been picked up disabled at the bottom
of it He had a short stout piece of iron that did to hammer the spikes
in and that had to be done very soft and quiet you may be sure

It took a long time I thought the night would be over and the daylight
come before it was all done it was so slow I could hear the ticktack
of his iron every time he knocked one of the spikes in Of course he
went higher every time They were just far enough apart for a man to
get his foot on from one to another As he went up he had one end of the
coil of the rope round his wrist When he got to the top he was to draw
it up to fasten to the top spike and lower himself down by it to the
ground on the other side At last I felt him pull hard on the rope I
held it and put my foot on the first spike I dont know that I should
have found it so very easy in the dark to get up by the spikesit was
almost blackfellows work when they put their big toe into a notch
cut in the smooth stem of a gum tree that runs a hundred feet without
a branch and climb up the outside of itbut Jim and I had often
practised this sort of climbing when we were boys and were both pretty
good at it As for Starlight he had been to sea when he was young and
could climb like a cat

When I got to the top I could just see his head above the wall The rope
was fastened well to the top spike which was driven almost to the head
into the wall Directly he saw me he began to lower himself down the
rope and was out of sight in a minute I wasnt long after him you may
be sure In my hurry I let the rope slip through my hands so fast they
were sore for a week afterwards But I didnt feel it then I should
hardly have felt it if I had cut them in two for as my feet touched
the ground in the darkness I heard the stamp of a horses hoof and the
jingle of a bitnot much of a sound but it went through my heart like
a knife along with the thought that I was a free man once more that
is free in a manner of speaking I knew we couldnt be taken then bar
accidents and I felt ready to ride through a regiment of soldiers

As I stood up a man caught my hand and gave it a squeeze as if hed have
crushed my fingers in I knew it was Jim Of course Id expected him to
be there but wasnt sure if hed be able to work it We didnt speak
but started to walk over to where two horses were standing with a man
holding em It was pretty dark but I could see Rainbows starjust in
his forehead it wasthe only white he had about him Of course it was
Warrigal that was holding them

We must doublebank my horse whispers Jim for a mile or two
till were clear of the place we didnt want to bring a lot of horses
about

He jumped up and I mounted behind him Starlight was on Rainbow in a
second The halfcaste disappeared he was going to keep dark for a few
days and send us the news Jims horse went off as if he had only ten
stone on his back instead of pretty nigh fiveandtwenty And we were
free Lord God to think that men can be such fools as ever to do
anything of their own free will and guiding that puts their liberty in
danger when theres such a world outside of a gaol wallsuch a heaven
on earth as long as a mans young and strong and has all the feelings
of a free man in a country like this Would I do the first crooked
thing again if I had my life to live over again and knew a hundredth
part of what I know now Would I put my hand in the fire out of laziness
or greed or sit still and let a snake sting me knowing I should be
dead in twelve hours Any mans fool enough to do one thatll do the
other Men and women dont know this in time thats the worst of it
they wont believe half theyre told by them that do know and wish em
well They run on heedless and obstinate too proud to take advice till
they do as we did The worlds always been the same I suppose and will
to the end Most of the books say so anyway




Chapter 20



What a different feel from prison air the fresh night breeze had as we
swept along a lonely outside track The stars were out though the sky
was cloudy now and then and the big forest trees looked strange in
the broken light It was so long since Id seen any I felt as if I was
going to a new world None of us spoke for a bit Jim pulled up at a
small hut by the roadside it looked like a farm but there was not much
show of crops or anything about the place There was a tumbledown
old barn with a strong door to it and a padlock it seemed the only
building that there was any care taken about A man opened the door of
the hut and looked out

Look sharp says Jim Is the horse all right and fit

Fit enough to go for the Hawkesbury Guineas I was up and fed him three
hours ago Hes

Bring him out and be hanged to you says Jim weve no time for
chat

The man went straight to the barn and after a minute or two brought out
a horsethe same Id ridden from Gippsland saddled and bridled and
ready to jump out of his skin Jim leaned forward and put something into
his hand which pleased him for he held my rein and stirrup and then
said

Good luck and a long reign to you as we rode away

All this time Starlight had sat on his horse in the shade of a tree a
good bit away When we started he rode alongside of us We were soon in
a pretty fair handgallop and we kept it up All our horses were good
and we bowled along as if we were going to ride for a week without
stopping

What a ride it was It was a grand night anyway I thought so I blessed
the stars I know Mile after mile and still the horses seemed to go
all the fresher the farther they went I felt I could ride on that way
for ever As the horses pulled and snorted and snatched at their bridles
I felt as happy as ever I did in my life Mile after mile it was all the
same we could hear Rainbow snorting from time to time and see his star
move as he tossed up his head We had many a night ride after together
but that was the best We had laid it out to make for a place we knew
not so far from home We dursnt go there straight of course but nigh
enough to make a dart to it whenever we had word that the coast was
clear

We knew directly we were missed the whole countryside would be turned
out looking for us and that every trooper within a hundred miles would
be hoping for promotion in case he was lucky enough to drop on either of
the Marstons or the notorious Starlight His name had been pretty well
in every ones mouth before and would be a little more before they were
done with him

It was too far to ride to the Hollow in a day but Jim had got a place
ready for us to keep dark in for a bit in case we got clear off
Theres never any great trouble in us chaps finding a home for a week
or two and somebody to help us on our way as long as weve the notes to
chuck about All the worse in the long run We rode hardish some people
would have called it a handgallop most of the way up hill and down
across the rocky creeks through thick timber More than one river we
had to swim It was mountain water and Starlight cursed and swore and
said he would catch his death of cold Then we all laughed it was the
first time wed done that since we were out My heart was too full to
talk much less laugh with the thought of being out of that cursed
prison and on my own horse again with the free bush breeze filling my
breast and the free forest Id lived in all my life once more around
me I felt like a king and as for what might come afterwards I had
no more thought than a schoolboy has of his next years lessons at the
beginning of his holidays It might come now As I took the old horse by
the head and raced him down the mountain side I felt I was living again
and might call myself a man once more

The sun was just rising the morning was misty and drizzling the long
sourgrass the branches of the scrubby trees everything we touched and
saw was dripping with the night dew as we rode up a gap between
two stiffish hills We had been riding all night from track to track
sometimes steering by guesswork Jim seemed to know the country in a
general way and he told us father and he had been about there a good
deal lately cattledealing and so on For the last hour or so we had
been on a pretty fair beaten road though there wasnt much traffic
on it It was one of the old mail tracks once but new coach lines had
knocked away all the traffic Some of the old inns had been good big
houses well kept and looked after then Now lots of them were empty
with broken windows and everything in ruins others were just good
enough to let to people who would live in them and make a living by
cultivating a bit and selling grog on the sly Where we pulled up was
one of these places and the people were just what you might expect

First of all there was the man of the house Jonathan Barnes a tall
slouching flashlooking native hed been a little in the horseracing
line a little in the prizefighting lineenough to have his nose
broken and was fond of talking about pugs as hed known intimatea
little in the farming and carrying line a little in every line that
meant a good deal of gassing drinking and idling and mighty little
hard work Hed a decent industrious little wife about forty times too
good for him and the girls Bella and Maddie worked well or else hed
have been walking about the country with a swag on his back They kept
him and the house too like many another man and he took all the credit
of it and ordered them about as if hed been the best and straightest
man in the land If he made a few pounds now and then hed drop it on a
horserace before hed had it a week They were glad enough to see us
anyhow and made us comfortable after a fashion Jim had brought fresh
clothes and both of us had stopped on the road and rigged ourselves
out so that we didnt look so queer as men just out of the jug mostly
do with their closeshaved faces cropped heads and prison clothes
Starlight had brought a false moustache with him which he stuck on so
that he looked as much like a swell as ever Warrigal had handed him a
small parcel which he brought with him just as we started and with
a ring on his finger some notes and gold in his pocket he ate his
breakfast and chatted away with the girls as if hed only ridden out
for a day to have a look at the country

Our horses were put in the stable and well looked to you may be
sure The man that straps a cross coves horse dont go short of his
halfcrowntwo or three of them maybe We made a firstrate breakfast
of it what with the cold and the wet and not being used to riding
lately we were pretty hungry and tired too We intended to camp there
that day and be off again as soon as it was dark

Of course we ran a bit of a risk but not as bad as we should by riding
in broad daylight The hills on the south were wild and rangy enough
but there were all sorts of people about on their business in the
daytime and of course any of them would know with one look that three
men all on wellbred horses riding right across country and not
stopping to speak or make free with any one were likely to be on the
crossall the more if the police were making particular inquiries
about them We were all armed too now Jim had seen to that If we
were caught we intended to have a flutter for it We were not going
back to Berrima if we knew it

So we turned in and slept as if we were never going to wake again Wed
had a glass of grog or two nothing to hurt though and the food and
one thing and another made us sleep like tops Jim was to keep a good
lookout and we didnt take off our clothes Our horses were kept
saddled too with the bridles on their heads and only the bits out
of their mouthswe could have managed without the bits at a
pincheverything ready to be out of the house in one minute and in
saddle and off fullsplit the next We were learned that trick pretty
well before things came to an end

Besides that Jonathan kept a good lookout too for strangers of the
wrong sort It wasnt a bad place in that way There was a long stony
track coming down to the house and you could see a horseman or a
carriage of any kind nearly a mile off Then in the old times the
timber had been cleared pretty nigh all round the place so there was
no chance of any one sneaking up unknown to people There couldnt have
been a better harbour for our sort and many a jolly spree we had there
afterwards Many a queer sight that old table in the little parlour saw
years after and the notes and gold and watches and rings and things
Ive seen the girls handling would have stunned you But that was all to
come

Well about an hour before dark Jim wakes us up and we both felt as
right as the bank It took a good deal to knock either of us out of time
in those days I looked round for a bit and then burst out laughing

Whats that about Dick says Jim rather serious

Blest if I didnt think I was in the thundering old cell again I
said I could have sworn I heard the bolt snap as your foot sounded in
the room

Well I hope we shant any of us be shopped again for a while says
he rather slow like Its bad work Im afraid and worse to come but
were in it up to our neck and must see it out Well have another feed
and be off at sundown Weve the devils own ride before daylight

Anybody called says Starlight sauntering in washed and dressed and
comfortablelooking You told them we were not at home Jim I hope

Jim smiled in spite of himself though he wasnt in a very gay humour
Poor old Jim was looking ahead a bit I expect and didnt see anything
much to be proud of

We had a scrumptious feed that night beefsteaks and eggs fresh butter
and milk things we hadnt smelt for months Then the girls waited
on us a goodlooking pair they was too full of larks and fun of all
kinds and not very particular what sort of jokes they laughed at They
knew well enough of course where wed come from and what we laid by
all day and travelled at night for they thought none the worse of us
for that not they Theyd been bred up where theyd heard all kinds of
rough talk ever since they was little kiddies and you couldnt well put
them out

They were a bit afraid of Starlight at first though because they seen
at once that he was a swell Jim they knew a little of he and father
had called there a good deal the last season and had done a little in
the stock line through Jonathan Barnes They could see I was something
in the same line as Jim So I suppose they had made it up to have a bit
of fun with us that evening before we started They came down into the
parlour where our tea was dressed out in their best and looking very
grand as I thought particularly as we hadnt seen the sight of so much
as a womans bonnet and shawl for months and months

Well Mr Marston says the eldest girl Bella to Jim we didnt
expect youd travel this way with friends so soon Why didnt you tell
us and wed have had everything comfortable

Wasnt sure about it says Jim and when you aint its safest to
hold your tongue Theres a good many things we all do that dont want
talking about

I feel certain Jim says Starlight with his soft voice and pleasant
smile which no woman as I ever saw could fight against long that any
mans secret would be safe with Miss Bella I would trust her with my
life freelynot that its worth a great deal

Oh Captain says poor Bella and she began to blush quite innocent
like you neednt fear there aint a girl from Shoalhaven to Albury
that would let on which way you were heading if they were to offer her
all the money in the country

Not even a diamond necklace and earrings Think of a lovely pendant a
cross all brilliants and a brooch to match my dear girl

I wouldnt come it unless I could get that lovely horse of yours
says the youngest one Maddie but Id do anything in the world to have
him Hes the greatest darling I ever saw Wouldnt he look stunning
with a sidesaddle Ive a great mind to duff him myself one of these
days

You shall have a ride on Rainbow next time we come says Starlight
Ive sworn never to give him away or sell him that is as long as
Im alive but Ill tell you what Ill doIll leave him to you in my
will

How do you mean says she quite excited like

Why if I drop one of these fine daysand its on the cards any
timeyou shall have Rainbow but mind now youre to promise mehere
he looked very gravethat youll neither sell him nor lend him nor
give him away as long as you live

Oh you dont mean it says the girl jumping up and clapping her
hands Id sooner have him than anything I ever saw in the world Oh
Ill take such care of him Ill feed him and rub him over myself only
I forgot Im not to have him before youre dead Its rather rough on
you isnt it

Not a bit says Starlight we must all go when our time comes If
anything happens to me soon hell be young enough to carry you for years
yet And youll win all the ladies hackney prizes at the shows

Oh I couldnt take him

But you must now Ive promised him to you and though I am awellan
indifferent character I never go back on my word

Havent you anything to give me Captain says Bella youre in such
a generous mind

I must bring you something says he next time we call What shall it
be Nows the time to ask Im like the fellow in the Arabian Nights
the slave of the ringyour ring Here he took the girls hand and
pretending to look at a ring she wore took it up and kissed it It
wasnt a very ugly one neither What will you have Bella

Id like a watch and chain she said pretending to look a little
offended I suppose I may as well ask for a good thing at once

Starlight pulled out a pocketbook and quite solemn and regular made
a note of it

Its yours he said within a month If I cannot conveniently call
and present it in person Ill send it by a sure hand as they used to
say and now Jim boot and saddle

The horses were out by this time the groom was walking Rainbow up and
down hed put a regular Frenchpolish on his coat and the old horse
was arching his neck and chawing his bit as if he thought he was going
to start for the Bargo Town Plate Jonathan himself was holding our two
horses but looking at him

My word he said thats a real picture of a horse hes too good for
awellthese roads he ought to be in Sydney carrying some swell about
and never knowing what a days hardship feels like Isnt he a regular
outandouter to look at And they tell me his looks is about the worst
of him Wellheres luck Starlight had called for drinks all round
before we started Heres luck to roads and coaches and them as lives
by em Theyll miss the old coaching system some daymark my word
I dont hold with these railways theyre talkin aboutall steam and
hurryscurry it starves the country

Quite right Jonathan says Starlight throwing his leg over Rainbow
and chucking the old groom a sovereign The times have never been half
as good as in the old coaching days before we ever smelt a funnel in
New South Wales But theres a coach or two left yet isnt there and
sometimes theyre worth attending to

He bowed and smiled to the girls and Rainbow sailed off with his
beautiful easy springy stride He always put me in mind of the deer I
once saw at Mulgoa near Penrith Id never seen any before My word
how one of them sailed over a farmers wheat paddock fence Hed been in
there all night and when he saw us coming he just up and made for the
fence and flew it like a bird I never saw any horse have the same
action only Rainbow You couldnt tire him and he was just the
same the end of the day as the beginning If he hadnt fallen into
Starlights hands as a colt hed have been a secondclass racehorse and
wore out his life among touts and ringmen He was better where he was
Off we went what a ride we had that night Just as well wed fed and
rested before we started else we should never have held out All
that night long we had to go and keep going A deal of the road was
roughnear the Shoalhaven country across awful deep gullies with
a regular climbup the other side like the side of a house Through
dismal ironbark forests that looked as black by night as if all the
treetrunks were castiron and the leaves gunmetal The night wasnt as
dark as it might have been but now and again there was a storm and the
whole sky turned as black as a wolfs throat as father used to say We
got a few knocks and scrapes against the trees but partly through the
horses being pretty clever in their kind of way and having sharpish
eyesight of our own we pulled through Its no use talking sometimes
I thought Jim must lose his way Starlight told us hed made up his mind
that we were going round and round and would fetch up about where wed
started from and find the Moss Vale police waiting there for us

All right Captain says Jim dont you flurry yourself Ive been
along this track pretty often this last few months and I can steer by
the stars Look at the Southern Cross there you keep him somewhere on
the right shoulder and youll pull up not so very far off that black
range above old Rocky Flat

Youre not going to be so mad as to call at your own place Jim are
you says he Gorings sure to have a greyhound or two ready to slip
in case the hare makes for her old form

Trust old dad for that says Jim he knows Dick and you are on the
grass again Hell meet us before we get to the place and have fresh
horses Ill bet hes got a chap or two that he can trust to smell out
the traps if they are close handy the old spot Theyll be mighty clever
if they get on the blind side of father

Well we must chance it I suppose I said but we were sold once
and Ive not much fancy for going back again

Theyre all looking for you the other way this blessed minute Ill go
bail says Jim Most of the coves that bolt from Berrima takes down
the southern road to get across the border into Port Philip as soon as
they can work it They always fancy they are safer there

So they are in some ways I wouldnt mind if we were back there again
I said Theres worse places than Melbourne but once we get to the
Hollow and thatll be some time today we may take it easy and spell
for a week or two How theyll wonder what the deuce has become of us

The night was long and that cold that Jims beard was froze as stiff
as a board but I sat on my horse I declare to heaven and never felt
anything but pleasure and comfort to think I was loose again Youve
seen a dog thats been chained up Well when hes let loose dont he
go chevying and racing about over everything and into everything thats
next or anigh him Hell jump into water or over a fence and turn aside
for nothing Hes mad with joy and the feeling of being off the chain
he cant hardly keep from barking till hes hoarse and rushing through
and over everything till hes winded and done up Then he lies down with
his tongue out and considers it all over

Well a mans just like that when hes been on the chain He maynt
jump about so much though Ive seen foreign fellows do that when their
collar was unbuckled but he feels the very same things in his heart as
that dog does you take my word for it

So as I said though I was sitting on a horse all that long cold
winters night through and had to mind my eye a bit for the road and
the rocks and the hanging branches I felt my heart swell that much and
my courage rise that I didnt care whether the night was going to turn
into a snowstorm like wed been in Kiandra way or whether wed have
a dozen rivers to swim like the headwaters of the MAlister in
Gippsland as nearly drowned the pair of us There I sat in my saddle
like a man in a dream lettin my horse follow Jims up hill and down
dale and half the time lettin go his head and givin him his own road
Everything too I seemed to notice and to be pleased with somehow
Sometimes it was a rock wallaby out on the feed that wed come close
on before we saw one another and it would jump away almost under the
horses neck taking two or three awful long springs and lighting square
and level among the rocks after a dropleap of a dozen feet like a cat
jumping out of a window But the cats got four legs to balance on and
the kangaroo only two How they manage it and measure the distance
so well God only knows Then an old possum would sing out or a
blackfurred flying squirrelpongos the blacks call emwould come
sailing down from the top of an ironbark tree with all his stern sails
spread as the sailors say and into the branches of another looking
as big as an eaglehawk And then wed come round the corner of a little
creek flat and be into the middle of a mob of wild horses that had come
down from the mountain to feed at night How theyd scurry off through
the scrub and up the range where it was like the side of a house and
that full of slatebars all upon edge that you could smell the hoofs of
the brumbies as the sharp stones rasped and tore and struck sparks out
of them like you do the parings in a blacksmiths shop

Then just as I thought daybreak was near a great mopoke flits close
over our heads without any rustling or noise like the ghost of a
bird and begins to hoot in a big bare hollow tree just ahead of us
Hoohoo hoohoo The last time I heard it it made me shiver a bit Now
I didnt care I was a desperate man that had done bad things and was
likely to do worse But I was free of the forest again and had a good
horse under me so I laughed at the bird and rode on




Chapter 21



Daylight broke when we were close up to the Black Range safe enough
a little off the line but nothing to signify Then we hit off the track
that led over the Gap and down into a little flat on a creek that ran
the same way as ours did

Jim had managed for father and Warrigal to meet us somewhere near here
with fresh horses There was an old shepherds hut that stood by itself
almost covered with marshmallows and nettles As we came down the steep
track a dog came up snuffing and searching about the grass and stones as
if hed lost something It was Crib

Now were getting home Jim says Starlight Its quite a treat to
see the old scamp again Well old man he says to the dog hows all
getting on at the Hollow The dog came right up to Rainbow and rubbed
against his fetlock and jumped up two or three times to see if he could
touch his rider He was almost going to bark he seemed that glad to see
him and us

Dad was sitting on a log by the hut smoking just the same as he was
before he left us last time He was holding two fresh horses and we
were not sorry to see them Horses are horses and there wasnt much
left in our two We must have ridden a good eighty miles that night and
it was as bad as a hundred by daylight

Father came a step towards us as we jumped off By George I was that
stiff with the long ride and the cold that I nearly fell down Hed got
a bit of a fire so we lit our pipes and had a comfortable smoke

Well Dick youre back agin I see he says pretty pleasant for him
Glad to see you Captain once more Its been lonesome worknobody
but me and Jim and Warrigal thats like a bear with a sore head half
his time Id a mind to roll into him once or twice and I should too
only for his being your property like

Thank you Ben Ill knock his head off myself as soon as we get
settled a bit Warrigals not a bad boy but a good deal like a Rocky
Mountain mule hes no good unless hes knocked down about once a month
or so only he doesnt like any one but me to do it

Youll see him about a mile on says father He told me hed be
behind the big rock where the tree growson the left of the road He
said hed get you a fresh horse so as he could take Rainbow back to the
Hollow the long way round

Sure enough after wed just got well on the road again Warrigal comes
quietly out from behind a big granite boulder and shows himself He was
riding Bilbah and leading a wellbred goodlooking chestnut He was
one of the young ones out of the Hollow Hed broken him and got him
quiet I remembered when I was there first spotting him as a yearling I
knew the blaze down his face and his three white legs

Warrigal jumps off Bilbah and throws down the bridle Then he leads the
chestnut up to where Starlight was standing smoking and throws himself
down at his feet bursting out crying like a child He was just like
a dog that had found his master again He kept looking up at Starlight
just like a dog does and smiling and going on just as if he never
expected to see such a good thing again as long as he lived

Well Warrigal says Starlight very careless like so youve brought
me a horse I see Youve been a very good boy Take Rainbow round
the long way into the Hollow Look after him whatever you do or Ill
murder you Not that hes done or anything near it but had enough
for one ride poor old man Off with you He changed the saddle and
Warrigal hopped on to Bilbah and led off Rainbow who tossed his head
and trotted away as if hed lots to spare and hadnt had twelve hours
under saddle best part without a halt or a bait Ive seen a few good
uns in my time but I never saw the horse that was a patch on Rainbow
take him all round

We pushed on again then for ten miles and somewhere about eight
oclock we pulled up at homeat home Aileen knew we were coming and
ran out to meet us She threw her arms round me and kissed and cried
over me for ever so long before she took any notice of Starlight whod
got down and was looking another way Oh my boy my boy she said I
never thought to see you again for years How thin youve got and pale
and strange looking Youre not like your old self at all But youre
in the bush again now by Gods blessing We must hide you better next
time I declare I begin to feel quite wicked and as if I could fight
the police myself

Well spoken Miss Marston said Starlight just lifting his hat and
making a bit of a bow like just as if she was a real lady but he was
the same to all women He treated them all alike with the same respect
of manner as if they were duchesses young or old gentle or simpleit
made no odds to him We must have your assistance if were to do any
good Though whether it wouldnt be more prudent on your part to cut us
all dead beginning with your father I shouldnt like to say

Aileen looked at him surprised and angry like for a second Then she
says

Captain Starlight its too late now but words can never tell how I
hate and despise the whole thing My love for Dick got the better of my
reason for a bit but I couldWhy how pale you look

He was growing pale and no mistake He had been ill for a bit before
he left Berrima though he wouldnt give in and the ride was rather too
much for him I suppose Anyhow down he tumbles in a dead faint Aileen
rushed over and lifted up his head I got some water and dabbed it over
him After a bit he came to He raises himself on his elbows and looks
at Aileen Then he smiles quietly and says

Im quite ashamed of myself Im growing as delicate as a young lady I
hope I havent given you much trouble

When he got up and walked to the verandah he quite staggered showing he
was that weak as he could hardly walk without help

I shall be all right he said after a weeks riding again

And where are you going when you leave this place she asked Surely
you and my brothers never can live in New South Wales after all that has
passed

We must try at all events Miss Marston Starlight answered raising
up his head and looking proud You will hear something of us before
long

We made out that there was no great chance of our being run into at the
old place Father went on first with Crib He was sure to give warning
in some way best known to father himself if there was any one about
that wasnt the right sort So we went up and went in

Mother was inside I thought it was queer that she didnt come outside
She was always quick enough about that when we came home before day or
night When I went in I could see when she got up from her chair that
she was weak and looked as if shed been ill She looked ever so much
older and her hair was a lot grayer than it used to be

She held out her arms and clung round my neck as if Id been raised from
the dead So I was in a kind of a way But she didnt say much or ask
what I was going to do next Poor soul she knew it couldnt be much
good anyway and that if we were hunted before wed be worse hunted
now Those that hadnt heard of our little game with the Momberah cattle
would hear of our getting out of Berrima Gaol which wasnt done every
day

We hadnt a deal of time to spare because we meant to start off for the
Hollow that afternoon and get there some time in the night even if
it was late Jim and dad knew the way in almost blindfold Once we got
there we could sleep for a week if we liked and take it easy all roads
So father told mother and Aileen straight that wed come for a good
comfortable meal and a rest and we must be off again

Oh father cant Dick and Jim stop for a day cries out Aileen It
does seem so hard when we havent seen Dick for such a while and he
shut up too all the time

Dye want to have us all took the same as last time growls father
Womens never contented as I can see For two pins I wouldnt have
brought them this way at all I dont want to be making roads from this
old crib to the Hollow only I thought youd like one look at Dick

We must do whats best of course said poor Aileen but its
hardvery hard on us Its mother Im thinking of you know If you
knew how she always wakes up in the night and calls for Dick and cries
when she wakes up youd try to comfort her a bit more father

Comfort her says dad why what can I do Dont I tell you if we
stay about here were shopped as safe as anything ever was Will that
comfort her or you either Were safe today because Ive got telegraphs
on the outside that the police cant pass without ringing the bellin
a way of speaking But you see tomorrow therell be more than one lot
here and I want to be clean away before they come

You know best says Aileen but suppose they come here tomorrow
morning at daylight as they did last time and bring a black tracker
with them wont he be able to follow up your track when you go away
tonight

No he wont for this reason we shall all ride different ways as soon
as we leave here A good while before we get near the place where we all
meet we shall find Warrigal on the lookout He can take the Captain in
by another track and therell be only Jim and I and the old dog the
only three persons thatll go in the near way

And when shall we seeseeany of you again

Somewheres about a month I suppose if weve luck Theres a deal
belongs to that Youd better go and see what there is for us to eat
Weve a long way and a rough way to go before we get to the Hollow

Aileen was off at this and then she set to work and laid a clean
tablecloth in the sittingroom and set us down our mealbreakfast or
whatever it was It wasnt so badcorned beef firstrate potatoes
fresh damper milk butter eggs Tea of course its the great drink
in the bush and although some doctors say its no good what would
bushmen do without it

We had no intention of stopping the whole night though we were tempted
to do soto have one nights rest in the old place where we used to
sleep so sound before It was no good thinking of anything of that kind
anyhow for a good while to come What wed got to do was to look out
sharp and not be caught simple again like we was both last time

After we had our tea we sat outside the verandah and tried to make the
best of it Jim stayed inside with mother for a good while she didnt
leave her chair much now and sat knitting by the hour together There
was a great change come over her lately She didnt seem to be afraid
of our getting caught as she used to be nor half as glad or sorry about
anything It seemed like as if shed made up her mind that everything
was as bad as it could be and past mending So it was she was right
enough there The only one who was in real good heart and spirits was
Starlight Hed come round again and talked and rattled away and made
Aileen and Jim and me laugh in spite of everything He said we had all
fine times before us now for a year or two any way That was a good
long time After that anything might happen What it would be he neither
knew nor cared Life was made up of short bits sometimes it was hard
luck sometimes everything went jolly and well Wed got our liberty
again our horses and a place to go to where all the police in the
country would never find us He was going in for a short life and
a merry one He for one was tired of small adventures and he was
determined to make the name of Starlight a little more famous before
very long If Dick and Jim would take his advicethe advice of a
desperate illfated outcast but still staunch to his friendsthey
would clear out and leave him to sink or swim alone or with such
associates as he might pick up whose destination would be no great
matter whatever befell them They could go into hiding for a whilemake
for Queensland and then go into the northern territory There was new
country enough there to hide all the fellows that were wanted in New
South Wales

But why dont you take your own advice said Aileen looking over at
Starlight as he sat there quite careless and comfortablelooking as if
hed no call to trouble his head about anything Isnt your life worth
mending or saving Why keep on this reckless miserable career which you
yourself expect to end ill

If you ask me Miss Marston he said whether my lifewhat is left
of itis worth saving I must distinctly answer that it is not It is
like the last coin or two in the gamblers purse not worth troubling
ones head about It must be flung on the board with the rest It might
land a reasonable stake But as to economising and arranging details
that would surely be the greatest folly of all

I heard Aileen sigh to herself She said nothing for a while and then
old Crib began to growl He got up and walked along the track that
led up the hill Father stood up too and listened We all did except
Starlight who appeared to think it was too much trouble and never
moved or seemed to notice

Presently the dog came walking slowly back and coiled himself up again
close to Starlight as if he had made up his mind it didnt matter
We could hear a horse coming along at a pretty good bat over the hard
rocky gravelly road We could tell it was a single horse and more than
that a barefooted one coming at a handgallop up hill and down dale
in a careless kind of manner This wasnt likely to be a police trooper
One man wouldnt come by himself to a place like ours at night and no
trooper if he did come would clatter along a hard track making row
enough to be heard more than a mile off on a quiet night

Its all right says father The old dog knowed him its Billy the
Boy Theres something up

Just as he spoke we saw a horseman come in sight and he rattled down
the stony track as hard as he could lick He pulled up just opposite
the house close by where we were standing It was a boy about fifteen
dressed in a ragged pair of moleskin trousers a good deal too large
for him but kept straight by a leather strap round the waist An old
cabbagetree hat and a blue serge shirt made up the rest of his rig
Boots he had on but they didnt seem to be fellows and one rusty spur
His hair was like a haycoloured mop halfhanging over his eyes which
looked sharp enough to see through a gum tree and out at the other side

He jumped down and stood before us while his horses flanks heaved up
and down like a pair of bellows

Well whats up says father

My word governor you was all in great luck as I come home last night
after bein away with them cattle to pound Bobby he dont know a
pleeceman from a woodanwater joey hed never have dropped they was
comin here unless theyd pasted up a notice on the door

How did you find out Billy says father and whenll they be here

Fust thing in the morning says the young wit grinning all over his
face Wont they be jolly well sold when they rides up and plants by
the yard same as they did last time when they took Dick

Which ones was they asks father fillin his pipe quite
businesslike just as if hed got days to spare

Them two fellers from Bargo one of ems a new chumgot his hair cut
short just like Dicks My word I thought hed been waggin it from
some o them Govment institooshns I did raly Dick old man

Youre precious free and easy my young friend says Starlight
walking over I rather like you You have a keen sense of humour
evidently but cant you say how you found out that the men were her
Majestys police officers in pursuit of us

Youre Capn Starlight I suppose says the youngster looking
straight and square at him and not a bit put out Well Ive been
pretty quick coming thirty mile inside of three hours Ill be bound
I heard them talking about you It was Starlight this and Starlight that
all the time I was going in and out of the room pretending to look for
something and mother scolding me

Had they their uniform on I asked

No fear They thought we didnt tumble I expect but I seen their
horses hung up outside both shod all round bits and irons bright
Stabled horses too I could swear Then the youngest chaphim with the
old felt hatwalked like this

Here he squared his shoulders put his hands by his side and marched up
and down looking for all the world like one of them chaps that played
at soldiering in Bargo

Theres no hiding the military air you think Billy said Starlight
That fellow was a recruit and had been drilled lately

I dno Mother got em to stay and began to talk quite innocentlike
of the bad characters there was in the country Ha ha It was as good
as a play Then they began to talk almost right out about Sergeant
Goring having been away on a wrong scent and how wild he was and how
he would be after Starlights mob tomorrow morning at daylight and
some pleece was to meet him near Rocky Flat They didnt say they was
the pleece that was about four oclock and getting dark

How did you get the horse says Jim Hes not one of yours is he

Not he says the boy I wish I had him or the likes of him He
belongs to old Driver I was just workin it how Id get out and
catch our old moke without these chaps being fly as I was going to
talligrarph when mother says to me

Have you fetched in the black cow

We aint got no black cow but I knowed what she meant I says

No I couldnt find her

You catch old Johnny Smoker and look for her till you do find her if
its ten oclock tonight says mother very fierce Your fatherll
give you a fine larrupin if he comes home and theres that cow lost

So off I goes and mans old Johnny and clears out straight for here
When I came to Drivers I runs his horses up into a yard nigh the angle
of his outside paddock and collars this little oss and lets old Johnny
go in hobbles My word this cove can scratch

So it seems says Starlight heres a sovereign for you youngster
Keep your ears and eyes open youll always find that good information
brings a good price Id advise you to keep away from Mr Marston sen
and people of his sort and stick to your work if I thought there was
the least earthly chance of your doing so but I see plainly that youre
not cut out for the industrious steadygoing line

Not if I know it said the boy I want to see life before I die
Im not going to keep on milling and slaving day after day all the year
round Ill cut it next year as sure as a gun I say wont you let me
ride a bit of the way with ye

Not a yard says father who was pretty cranky by this time you
go home again and put that horse where you got him We dont want old
Driver tracking and swearing after us because you ride his horses and
keep off the road as you go back

Billy the Boy nodded his head and jumping into his saddle rode
off again at much about the same pace hed come at He was a regular
reckless young devil as bold as a twoyearold colt in a brandingyard
thats ready to jump at anything and knock his brains out against a
stockyard post just because hes never known any real regular hurt or
danger and cant realise it He was terrible cruel to horses and would
ruin a horse in less time than any man or boy I ever seen I always
thought from the first that hed come to a bad end Howsoever he was
a wonderful chap to track and ride none could beat him at that he
was nearly as good as Warrigal in the bush He was as cunning as a
pet dingo and would look as stupid before any one he didnt know or
thought was too respectable as if he was half an idiot But no one
ever stirred within twenty or thirty miles of where he lived without our
hearing about it Father fished him out having paid him pretty well for
some small service and ever after that he said he could sleep in peace

We had the horses up ready saddled and fed by sundown and as soon as
the moon rose we made a start of it I had time for a bit of a talk
with Aileen about the Storefields though I couldnt bring myself to say
their names at first I was right in thinking that Gracey had seen me
led away a prisoner by the police She came into the hut afterwards with
Aileen as soon as mother was better and the two girls sat down beside
one another and cried their eyes out Aileen said

George Storefield had been very good and told Aileen that whatever
happened to us or the old man it would make no difference to him or
to his feelings towards her She thanked him but said she could never
consent to let him disgrace himself by marrying into a family like
ours He had come over every now and then and had seen they wanted for
nothing when father and Jim were away but she always felt her heart
growing colder towards him and his prosperity while we were so low down
in every way As for Gracey she Aileen believed that she was in love
with me in a quiet steady way of her own without showing it much but
that she would be true to me if I asked her to the end of the world
and she was sure that she could never marry any one else as long as
I lived She was that sort of girl So didnt I think I ought to do
everything I could to get a better character and try and be good enough
for such a girl She knew girls pretty well She didnt think there was
such another girl in the whole colony and so on

And when we went away where were we going to hide I could not say about
particular distances but I told her generally that wed keep out of
harms way and be careful not to be caught We might see her and mother
now and then and by bushtelegraphs and other people we could trust
should be able to send news about ourselves

Whats the Captain going to do she said suddenly He doesnt look
able to bear up against hardship like the rest of you What beautiful
small hands he has and his eyes are like sleeping fires

Oh hes a good deal stronger than he looks I said hes the
smartest of the lot of us except it is dad and Ive heard the old man
say he must knock under to him But dont you bother your head about
him hes quite able to take care of himself and the less a girl like
you thinks about a man like him the better for her

Oh nonsense she said at the same time looking down in a
halfconfused sort of way Im not likely to think about him or any one
else just now but it seems such a dreadful thing to think a man like
him so clever and daring and so handsome and gentle in his ways
should be obliged to lead such a life hunted from place to place
likelike

Like a bushranger Ailie I said for thatll be the long and short
of it You may as well know it now were going to turn out

You dont say that Dick she said Oh surely you will never be so
mad Do you want to kill mother and me right out If you do why not
take a knife or an axe and do it at once Her youve been killing all
along As for me I feel so miserable and degraded and despairing at
times that but for her I could go and drown myself in the creek when I
think of what the family is coming to

Whats the use of going on like that Aileen I said roughly If
were caught now whatever we do great or small were safe for years
and years in gaol Maynt we as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb What
odds can it make Well only have bolder work than duffing cattle and
faking horsebrands like a lot of miserable crawlers that are not game
for anything more sporting

I hear I hear says sister sitting down and putting her head in her
hands Surely the devil has power for a season to possess himself of
the souls of men and do with them what he will I know how obstinate
you are Dick Pray God you may not have poor Jims blood to answer for
as well as your own before all is done Goodbye I cant say God bless
you knowing what I do but may He turn your heart from all wicked
ways and keep you from worse and deadlier evil than you have committed
Goodnight Why oh why didnt we all die when we were little
children




Chapter 22



I brought it out suddenlike to Aileen before I could stop myself but
it was all true How we were to make the first start we couldnt agree
but we were bound to make another big touch and this time the police
would be after us for something worth while Anyhow we could take it
easy at the Hollow for a bit and settle all the ins and outs without
hurrying ourselves

Our dart now was to get to the Hollow that night some time and not to
leave much of a track either Nobody had found out the place yet and
wasnt going to if we knew It was too useful a hidingplace to give
away without trouble and we swore to take all sorts of good care to
keep it secret if it was to be done by the art of man

We went up Nulla Mountain the same way as we remembered doing when Jim
and I rode to meet father that time he had the lot of weaners We kept
wide and didnt follow on after one another so as to make a marked
trail It was a long dark dreary ride We had to look sharp so as not
to get dragged off by a breasthigh bough in the thick country There
was no fetching a doctor if any one was hurt Father rode ahead He knew
the ins and outs of the road better than any of us though Jim who had
lived most of his time in the Hollow after he got away from the
police was getting to know it pretty well We were obliged to go slow
mostlyfor a good deal of the track lay along the bed of a creek full
of boulders and rocks that we had to cross ever so many times in a
mile The sharpedged rocks too overhung low enough to knock your
brains out if you didnt mind

It was far into the night when we got to the old yard There it stood
just as I recollect seeing it the time Jim and I and father branded the
weaners It had only been used once or twice since It was patched up a
bit in places but nobody seemed to have gone next or nigh it for a long
time The grass had grown up round the sliprails it was as strange and
forsakenlooking as if it belonged to a deserted station

As we rode up a man comes out from an angle of the fence and gives a
whistle We knew almost without looking that it was Warrigal Hed
come there to meet Starlight and take him round some other way Every
track and short cut there was in the mountains was as easy to him as
the road to George Storefields was to us Nulla Mountain was full of
curious gullies and caves and places that the devil himself could hardly
have run a man to ground in unless hed lived near it all his life as
Warrigal had He wasnt very free in showing them to us but hed have
made a bridge of his own body any time to let Starlight go safe So when
they rode away together we knew he was safe whoever might be after us
and that we should see him in the Hollow some time next day

We went on for a mile or two farther then we got off and turned our
horses loose The rest of the way we had to do on foot My horse and
Jims had got regularly broke into Rocky Flat and we knew that theyd
go home as sure as possible not quite straight but keeping somewhere
in the right direction As for father he always used to keep a horse
or two trained to go home when hed done with him The pony he rode
tonight would just trot off and never put his nose to the ground
almost till he got wind of home

We humped our saddles and swags ourselves a stiffish load too but the
night was cool and we did our best It was no use growling It had to
be done and the sooner the better It seemed a long timefollowing
father step by stepbefore we came to the place where I thought the
cattle were going to be driven over the precipice Here we pulled up for
a bit and had a smoke It was a queer time and a queer lookout

Three oclock in the morningthe stars in the sky and it so clear
that we could see Nulla Mountain rising up against it a big black lump
without sign of tree or rock underneath the valley one sea of mist
and we just agoing to drop into it on the other side of the Hollow the
clear hill we called the Sugarloaf Everything seemed dead silent and
solitary and a rummier start than all here were wethree desperate
men driven to make ourselves a home in this lonesome Godforsaken
place I wasnt very fanciful by that time but if the devil had risen
up to make a fourth amongst us I shouldnt have been surprised The
place the time and the men seemed regularly cut out for him and his
mob

We smoked our pipes out and said nothing to each other good or bad
Then father makes a start and we follows him took a goodish while but
we got down all right and headed for the cave When we got there our
troubles were over for a while Jim struck a match and had a fire going
in no time there was plenty of dry wood of course Then father rolls
a keg out of a hole in the wall firstrate dark brandy it was and we
felt a sight better for a good stiff nip all round When a mans cold
and tired and hungry and down on his luck as well a good caulker of
grog dont do him no harm to speak of It strings him up and puts him
straight If hes anything of a man he can stand it and feel all the
better for it but its a precious sight too easy a lesson to learn and
theres them that cant stop once they begin till theyve smothered
what brains God Almighty put inside their skulls just as if they was
to bore a hole and put gunpowder in No they wouldnt stop if they were
sure of going to heaven straight or to hell next minute if they put the
last glass to their lips Ive heard men say it and knew they meant it
Not the worst sort of men either

We were none of us like that Not then anyhow We could take or leave
it and though dad could do with his share when it was going he always
knew what he was about and could put the peg in any time So we had
one strongish tot while the tea was boiling There was a bag of ship
biscuit we fried some hung beef and made a jolly good supper We were
that tired we didnt care to talk much so we made up the fire last
thing and rolled ourselves in our blankets I didnt wake till the sun
had been up an hour or more

I woke first Jim was fast asleep but dad had been up a goodish while
and got things ready for breakfast It was a fine clear morning
everything looked beautiful specially to me that had been locked up
away from this sort of thing so long The grass was thick and green
round the cave and right up to the big sandstone slabs of the floor
looking as if it had never been eat down very close No more it had It
would never have paid to have overstocked the Hollow What cattle and
horses they kept there had a fine time of it and were always in grand
condition

Opposite where we were the valley was narrow I could see the sandstone
precipices that walled us in a sort of yellowish white colour all
lighted up with the rays of the morning sun looking like gold towers
against the heavy green forest timber at the foot of them Birds were
calling and whistling and there was a little spring that fell drip
drip over a rough rock basin all covered with ferns A little mob of
horses had fed pretty close up to the camp and would walk up to look
curiouslike and then trot off with their heads and tails up It was a
pretty enough sight that met my eyes on waking It made me feel a sort
of false happiness for a time to think we had such a place to camp in
on the quiet and call our own in a manner of speaking

Jim soon woke up and stretched himself Then father began quite
cheerful like

Well boys what dye think of the Hollow again Its not a bad earth
for the old dogfox and his cubs when the hounds have run him close
They cant dig him out here or smoke him out either Weve no call to
do anything but rest ourselves for a week or two anyhow then we must
settle on something and buckle to it more businesslike Weve been too
helterskelter lately Jim and I We was beginning to run risks got
nearly dropped on more nor once

Theres no mistake its a grand thing to wake up and know youve got
nothing to do for a bit but to take it easy and enjoy yourself No
matter how light your work may be if its regular and has to be done
every day the harness ll gall somewhere you get tired in time and
sick of the whole thing

Jim and I knew well that bar accidents we were as safe in the Hollow
as we used to be in our beds when we were boys Wed searched it through
and through last time till wed come to believe that only three or
four people and those sometimes not for years at a time had ever been
inside of it There were no tracks of more

We could see how the first gang levied they were different Every now
and then they had a big drinka mad carouse as the books saywhen
they must have done wild strange things something like the Spanish
Main buccaneers wed read about Theyd brought captives with them too
We saw graves halfadozen together in one place THEY didnt belong
to the band

We had a quiet comfortable meal and a smoke afterwards Then Jim and I
took a long walk through the Hollow so as to tell one another what was
in our minds which we hadnt a chance to do before Before wed gone
far Jim pulls a letter out of his pocket and gives it to me

It was no use sending it to you old man while you was in the jug
he says it was quite bad enough without this so I thought Id keep it
till we were settled a bit like Now were going to set up in business
on our own account youd best look over your mail

I knew the writing well though I hadnt seen it lately It was from
herfrom Kate Morrison that was It begannot the way most women
write like HER though


So this is the end of your high and mighty doings Richard Marston
passing yourself and Jim off as squatters I dont blame himno of
course not nobody ever blamed Jim or would I suppose if hed burned
down Government House and stuck up his Excellency as he was coming out
of churchbut when I saw in the papers that you had been arrested for
cattlestealing I knew for the first time how completely Jeanie and I
had been duped

I wont pretend that I didnt think of the money you were said to have
and how pleasant it would be to spend some of it after the miserable
scrambling skimping life we had lately been used to But I loved you
Dick Marston for YOURSELF with a deep and passionate love which you
will never know now which you would scorn and treat lightly perhaps
if you did know You may yet find out what you have lost if ever you
get out of that frightful gaol

I was not such a silly fool as to pine and fret over our romance so
cruelly disturbed though Jeanie was it nearly broke her heart No
Richard my nature is not of that make I generally get even with people
who wrong me I send you a photo giving a fair idea of myself and my
HUSBAND Mr Mullockson I accepted his offer soon after I saw your
adventures and those of your friend Starlight in every newspaper in
the colonies I did not hold myself bound to live single for your
sake so did what most women do though they pretend to act from other
motives I disposed of myself to the best advantage

Mr Mullockson has plenty of money which is NEARLY everything in this
world so that I am comfortable and well off as far as that goes If
I am not happy that is your faultyour fault I say because I am not
able to tear your false image and false self from my thoughts Whatever
happens to me in the future you may consider yourself to blame for I
should have been a happy and fairly good woman as far as women go
if you had been true or rather if everything about you had not been
utterly false and despicable

You think it fortunate after reading this I daresay that we are
separated for ever BUT WE MAY MEET AGAIN Richard Marston THEN you may
have reason to curse the day as I do most heartily when you first set
eyes on KATE MULLOCKSON


Not a pleasant letter by no manner of means I was glad I didnt get it
while I was eating my heart out under the stifling low roof of the cell
at Nomah or when I was bearing my load at Berrima A few pounds more
when the weight was all I could bear and live would have crushed the
heart out of me I didnt want anything to cross me when I was looking
at mother and Aileen and thinking how between us wed done everything
our worst enemy could have wished us to do But here when there was
plenty of time to think over old days and plan for the future I could
bear the savage spiteful sound of the whole letter and laugh at the
way she had got out of her troubles by taking up with a rough old fellow
whose chequebook was the only decent thing about him I wasnt sorry to
be rid of her either Since Id seen Gracey Storefield again every other
woman seemed disagreeable to me I tore up the letter and threw it away
hoping I had done for ever with a woman that no man living would ever
have been the better for

Glad you take it so quiet Jim says after holding his tongue longer
than he did mostly Shes a bad coldhearted jade though she is
Jeanies sister If I thought my girl was like her shed never have
another thought from me but she isnt and never was The worse luck
Ive had the closer shes stuck to me like a little brick as she is
Id give all I ever had in the world if I could go to her and say Here
I am Jim Marston without a penny in the world but I can look every
man in the face and well work our way along the road of life cheerful
and loving together But I CANT say it Dick thats the devil of
it and it makes me so wild sometimes that I could knock my brains out
against the first ironbark tree I come across

I didnt say anything but I took hold of Jims hand and shook it
We looked in each others eyes for a minute there was no call to say
anything We always understood one another Jim and I

As we were safe to stop in the Hollow for long spells at a time we took
a good look over it as far as we could do on foot We found a rum sort
of place at the end of a long gully that went easterly from the main
flat In one way youd think the whole valley had been an arm of the sea
some time or other It was a bit like Sydney Harbour in shape with one
principal valley and no end of small cover and gullies running off from
it and winding about in all directions Even the sandstone walls by
which the whole affair great and small was hemmed in were just like
the cliff about South Head there were lines too on the face of them
Jim and I made out just like where the waves had washed marks and
levels on the searock We didnt trouble ourselves much about that part
of it Whatever might have been there once it grew stunning fine grass
now and there was beautiful clear fresh water in all the creeks that
ran through it

Well we rambled up the long crooked gully that I was talking about
till about halfway up it got that narrow that it seemed stopped by a
big rock that had tumbled down from the top and blocked the path It was
pretty well grown over with wild raspberries and climbers

No use going farther says Jim theres nothing to see

I dont know that Been a track here some time Lets get round and
see

When we got round the rock the track was plain again it had been well
worn once though neither foot nor hoof much had been along it for many
a year It takes a good while to wear out a track in a dry country

The gully widened out bit by bit till at last we came to a little
round green flat right under the rock walls which rose up a couple of
thousand feet above it on two sides On the flat was an old hutvery
old it seemed to be but not in bad trim for all that The roof was of
shingles split thick and wedge shaped the walls of heavy ironbark
slabs and there was a stone chimney

Outside had been a garden a few rose trees were standing yet ragged
and stunted The wallabies had trimmed them pretty well but we knew
what they were Been a cornpatch toothe marks where it had been hoed
up were there same as they used to do in old times when there were more
hoes than ploughs and more convicts than horses and working bullocks in
the country

Well this is a rum start says Jim as we sat down on a log outside
that looked as if it had been used for a seat before Who the deuce
ever built this gunyah and lived in it by himself for years and years
You can see it was no two or three months time he done here Theres
the spring coming out of the rock he dipped his water from The tracks
reglar worn smooth over the stones leading to it There was a fence
round this garden some of the rails lying there rotten enough but it
takes time for sound hard wood to rot Hed a stool and table too not
bad ones either this Robinson Crusoe cove No end of manavilins either
I wonder whether he come here before them firstGovernment menchaps
we heard of Likely he did and died here too He might have chummed in
with them of course or he might not Perhaps Starlight knows something
about him or Warrigal Well ask them

We fossicked about for a while to see if the man who lived so long by
himself in this lonely place had left anything behind him to help us
make out what sort he was We didnt find much There was writing on
the walls here and there and things cut on the fireplace posts Jim
couldnt make head or tail of them nor me either

The old cove may have left something worth having behind him he said
after staring at the cold hearth ever so long Men like him often leave
gold pieces and jewels and things behind them locked up in brassbound
boxes leastways the storybooks say so Ive half a mind to root up the
old hearthstone its a thundering heavy one aint it I wonder how he
got it here all by himself

It IS pretty heavy I said For all we know he may have had help to
bring it in Weve no time now to see into it wed better make tracks
and see if Starlight has made back We shall have to shape after a bit
and we may as well see how he stands affected

Hell be back safe enough Theres no pull in being outside now with
all the world chevying after you and only half rations of food and
sleep

Jim was right As we got up to the cave we saw Starlight talking to the
old man and Warrigal letting go the horse Theyd taken their time to
come in but Warrigal knew some hole or other where theyd hid before
very likely so they could take it easier than we did the night we left
Rocky Creek

Well boys says Starlight coming forward quite heartily glad to
see you again been taking a walk and engaging yourselves this fine
weather Rather nice country residence of ours isnt it Wonder how
long we shall remain in possession What a charm there is in home No
place like home is there governor

Dad didnt smile he very seldom did that but I always thought he never
looked so glum at Starlight as he did at most people

The place is well enough he growled if we dont smother it all by
letting our tracks be followed up Weve been dashed lucky so far but
itll take us all we know to come in and out if weve any roadwork on
hand and no one the wiser

It can be managed well enough says Starlight Is that dinner
ever going to be ready Jim make the tea theres a good fellow Im
absolutely starving The main thing is never to be seen together except
on great occasions Two men or three at the outside can stick up any
coach or travellers that are worth while We can get home one by one
without half the risk there would be if we were all together Hand me
the corned beef if you please Dick We must hold a council of war by
and by

We were smoking our pipes and lying about on the dry floor of the cave
with the sun coming in just enough to make it pleasant when I started
the ball

We may as well have it out now what lay were going upon and whether
were all agreed in our minds TO TURN OUT and do the thing in the
regular good oldfashioned Sydneyside style Its risky of course and
were sure to have a smart brush or two but Im not going to be jugged
again not if I know it and I dont see but what bushrangingyes
BUSHRANGING its no use saying one thing and meaning anotheraint
as safe a game let alone the profits of it as mooching about
cattleduffing and being lagged in the long run all the same




Chapter 23



Because its too late growled father too late by years Its sink
or swim with all of us If we work together we may make ten thousand
pounds or more in the next four or five years enough to clear out with
altogether if weve luck If any of us goes snivelling in now and giving
himself up theyd know theres something crooked with the lot of us
and theyll run us down somehow Ill see em all in the pit of hl
before I give in and if Jim does he opens the door and sells the pass
on us You can both do what you like And here the old man walked bang
away and left us

No use Dick says Jim If he wont its no use my giving in I cant
stand being thought a coward Besides if you were nabbed afterwards
people might say it was through me Id sooner be killed and buried a
dozen times over than that Its no use talkingit isnt to bewe had
better make up our minds once for all and then let the matter drop

Poor old Jim He had gone into it innocent from the very first He was
regular led in because he didnt like to desert his own flesh and blood
even if it was wrong Bit by bit he had gone on not liking or caring
for the thing one bit but following the lead of others till he reached
his present pitch How many men and women too there are in the world
who seem born to follow the lead of others for good or evil They get
drawn in somehow and end by paying the same penalty as those that meant
nothing else from the start

The finish of the whole thing was this that we made up our minds to
turn out in the bushranging line It might seem foolish enough to
outsiders but when you come to think of it we couldnt better ourselves
much We could do no worse than we had done nor run any greater risk to
speak of We were long sentence men as it was sure of years and years
in prison and besides we were certain of something extra for breaking
gaol Jim and Warrigal were wanted and might be arrested by any
chance trooper who could recollect their description in the Police
Gazette Father might be arrested on suspicion and remanded again and
again until they could get some evidence against him for lots of things
that hed been in besides the Momberah cattle When it was all boiled
down it came to this that we could make more money in one night by
sticking up a coach or a bank than in any other way in a year That when
we had done it we were no worse off than we were now as far as being
outlaws and there was a chancenot a very grand one but still
a chancethat we might find a way to clear out of New South Wales
altogether

So we settled it at that We had plenty of good horseswhat with
the young ones coming on that Warrigal could break and what we had
already There was no fear of running short of horseflesh Firearms we
had enough for a dozen men They were easy enough to come by We knew
that by every mailcoach that travelled on the Southern or Western line
there was always a pretty fair sprinkling of notes sent in the letters
besides what the passengers might carry with them watches rings and
other valuables It wasnt the habit of people to carry arms and if
they did there isnt one in ten that uses em Its all very well to
talk over a dinnertable but any one whos been stuck up himself knows
that theres not much chance of doing much in the resisting line

Suppose youre in a coach or riding along a road Well youre expected
and waited for and the road party knows the very moment youll turn up
They see you acoming You dont see them till its too late Theres a
log or something across the road if its a coach or else the drivers
walking his horses up a steepish hill Just at the worst pinch or at a
turn some one sings out Bail up The coachman sees a strange man in
front or close alongside of him with a revolver pointed straight
at him He naturally dont like to be shot and he pulls up Theres
another man covering the passengers in the body of the coach and he
says if any man stirs or lifts a finger hell give him no second chance
Just behind on the other side theres another manperhaps two Well
whats any one if hes ever so game to do If he tries to draw a
weapon or move ever so little hes rapped at that second He can only
shoot one man even if his aim is good which its not likely to
be What is more the other passengers dont thank himquite the
contraryfor drawing the fire on them I have known men take away a
fellows revolver lest he should get them all into trouble That was a
queer start wasnt it Actually preventing a man from resisting They
were quite right though he could only have done mischief and made it
harder for himself and every one else If the passengers were armed and
all steady and game to stand a flutter something might be done but you
dont get a coachload like that very often So its found better in a
general way to give up what they have quietly and make no fuss about it
Ive known cases where a single bushranger was rushed by a couple of
determined men but that was because the chap was careless and they
were very active and smart He let them stand too near him They had
him simple enough and he was hanged for his carelessness but when
theres three or four men all armed and steady its no use trying the
rush dodge with them

Of course there were other things to think about what we were to do
with the trinkets and banknotes and things when we got themhow to
pass them and so on There was no great bother about that Besides
Jonathan Barnes and chaps of his sort dad knew a few fences that had
worked for him before Of course we had to suffer a bit in value These
sort of men make you pay through the nose for everything they do for
you But we could stand that out of our profits and we could stick to
whatever was easy to pass and some of the smaller things that were light
to carry about Men that make 300 or 400 Pounds of a night can afford to
pay for accommodation

The big houses in the bush too Nothings easier than to stick up one
of themlots of valuable things besides money often kept there and
its ten to one against any one being on the lookout when the boys
come A man hears theyre in the neighbourhood and keeps a watch for
a week or two But he cant be always waiting at home all day long with
doublebarrelled guns and all his young fellows and the overseer that
ought to be at their work among their cattle or sheep on the run idling
their time away No he soon gets sick of that and either sends his
family away to town till the dangers past or he chances it as
people do about a good many things in the country Then some fine day
about eleven or twelve oclock or just before tea or before theyve
gone to bed the dogs bark and three or four chaps seem to have got
into the place without anybody noticing em the master of the house
finds all the revolvers looking his way and the things done The
house is cleared out of everything valuable though nobodys harmed or
frightenedin a general way that isa couple of the best horses are
taken out of the stable and the next morning theres another flaring
article in the local paper A good many men tried all they knew to
be prepared and have a show for it but there was only one that ever
managed to come out right

We didnt mean to turn out all in a minute Wed had a rough time of it
lately and we wanted to wait and take it easy in the Hollow and close
about for a month or so before we began business

Starlight and I wanted to let our beards grow People without any hair
on their faces are hardly ever seen in the country now except theyve
been in gaol lately and of course we should have been marked men

We saw no reason why we shouldnt take it easy Starlight was none too
strong though he wouldnt own it he wouldnt have fainted as he did if
he had He wanted good keep and rest for a month and so did I Now that
it was all over I felt different from what I used to do only half the
man I once was If we stayed in the Hollow for a month the police might
think wed gone straight out of the country and slack off a bit Anyhow
as long as they didnt hit the trail off to the entrance we couldnt
be in a safer place and though there didnt seem much to do we thought
wed manage to hang it out somehow One day we were riding all together
in the afternoon when we happened to come near the gully where Jim and
I had gone up and seen the Hermits Hut as we had christened it Often
we had talked about it since wondered about the man who had lived in
it and what his life had been

This time wed had all the horses in and were doing a bit of
coltbreaking Warrigal and Jim were both on young horses that had only
been ridden once before and we had come out to give them a hand

Do you know anything about that hut in the gully I asked Starlight

Oh yes all there is to know about it and thats not much Warrigal
told me that while the first gang that discovered this desirable
country residence were in possession a stranger accidentally found
out the way in At first they were for putting him to death but on
his explaining that he only wanted a solitary home and should neither
trouble nor betray them they agreed to let him stay He was a big one
gentleman Warrigal said but he built the hut himself with occasional
help from the men He was liberal with his gold of which he had a small
store while it lasted He lived here many years and was buried under a
big peach tree that he had planted himself

A queer start to come and live and die here and about the strangest
place to pick for a home I ever saw

Theres a good many strange people in the colony Dick my boy says
Starlight and the longer you live the more youll find of them Some
day when weve got quiet horses well come up and have a regular
overhauling of the spot Its years since Ive been there

Suppose he turned out some big swell from the old country Dad says
there used to be a few in the old days in the colony He might have
left papers and things behind him that might turn to good account

Whatever he did leave was hidden away Warrigal says he was a little
chap when he died but he says he remembers men making a great coroboree
over him when he died and they could find nothing They always thought
he had money and he showed them one or two small lumps of gold and
what he said was golddust washed out from the creek bed

As we had no call to work now we went in for a bit of sport every
day Lord how long it seemed since Jim and I had put the guns on our
shoulders and walked out in the beautiful fresh part of the morning to
have a days shooting It made us feel like boys again When I said so
the tears came into Jims eyes and he turned his head away Father came
one day he and old Crib were a stunning pair for pot shooting and
he was a dead game shot though we could be at him with the rifle and
revolver

There was a pretty fair show of game too The lowan Mallee hen theyre
mostly called and talegalla brush turkey were thick enough in some of
the scrubby corners Warrigal used to get the lowan eggsbeautiful pink
thinshelled ones they are firstrate to eat and one of em a mans
breakfast Then there were pigeons wild ducks quail snipe now
and then besides wallaby and other kangaroos There was no fear of
starving even if we hadnt a tidy herd of cattle to come upon

The fishing wasnt bad either The creeks ran towards the northwest
watershed and were full of codfish bream and perch Even the jewfish
wasnt bad with their skins off They all tasted pretty good I tell
you after a quick broil let alone the fun of catching them Warrigal
used to make nets out of cooramin bark and put little weirs across the
shallow places so as we could go in and drive the fish in Many a fine
cod we took that way He knew all the blacks ways as well as a good
many of ours The worst of him was that except in hunting fishing and
riding hed picked up the wrong end of the habits of both sides Father
used to set snares for the brush kangaroo and the bandicoots like hed
been used to do for the hares in the old country We could always manage
to have some kind of game hanging up It kept us amused too

But I dont know whatever we should have done that month we stayed
there at the firstwe were never so long idle againwithout the
horses We used to muster them twice a week run em up into the big
receiving yard and have a regular good look over em till we knew every
one of em like a book

Some of em was worth looking at my word Dye see that big upstanding
threeyearold dark bay filly with a crooked streak down her face
Starlight would say and no brand but your fathers on Do you know her
name Thats young Termagant a daughter of Mr Rouncivals racing mare
of the same name that was stolen a week before she was born and her dam
was never seen alive again Pity to kill a mare like that wasnt it
Her sire was Repeater the horse that ran the two threemile heats with
Mackworth in grand time too Then again That chestnut colt with
the white legs would be worth five hundred all out if we could sell
him with his right name and breeding instead of having to do without a
pedigree We shall be lucky if we get a hundred clear for him The black
filly with the staryes shes thoroughbred too and couldnt have been
bought for money Only a month old and unbranded of course when your
father and Warrigal managed to bone the old mare Mr Gibson offered 50
Pounds reward or 100 Pounds on conviction Wasnt he wild That big bay
horse Warrior was in training for a steeplechase when I took him out
of Mr Kings stable I rode him 120 miles before twelve next day Those
two browns are Mr Whites famous buggy horses He thought no man could
get the better of him But your old father was too clever I believe he
could shake the devils own fourinhandcoal black with manes and
tails touching the ground and eyes of fire some German fellow says
they areand the Prince of Darkness never be the wiser The pull of it
is that once theyre in here theyre never heard of again till its time
to shift them to another colony or clear them out and let the buyer
take his chance

Youve some plums here I said Even the cattle look pretty well
bred

Always go for pedigree stock Fifteenth Duke notwithstanding They
take no more keep than rough ones and theyre always saleable That
red shorthorn heifer belongs to the Butterfly Red Rose tribe she was
carried thirty miles in front of a mans saddle the day she was calved
We suckled her on an old brindle cow she doesnt look the worse for it
Isnt she a beauty We ought to go in for an annual sale here How do
you think it would pay

All this was pleasant enough but it couldnt last for ever After the
first weeks rest which was real pleasure and enjoyment we began to
find the life too dull and dozy Wed had quite enough of a quiet life
and began to long for a bit of work and danger again Chaps that have
got something on their minds cant stand idleness it plays the bear
with them Ive always found they get thinking and thinking till they
get a low fit like and then if theres any grog handy they try to screw
themselves up with that It gives them a lift for a time but afterwards
they have to pay for it over and over again Thats where the drinking
habit comes inthey cant help itthey must drink If youll take the
trouble to watch men and women too that have been in trouble youll
find that nineteen out of every twenty drink like fishes when they get
the chance It aint the love of the liquor as teetotalers and those
kind of goody people always are ramming down your throatits the
love of nothing But its the fear of their own thoughtsthe dreadful
miserythe anxiety about whats to come thats always hanging like a
black cloud over their heads Thats what they cant stand and liquor
for a bit mind yousay a few hours or sotakes all that kind of
feeling clean away Of course it returns harder than before but that
says nothing It CAN be driven away All the heavyheartedness which
a man feels but never puts into words flies away with the first or
second glass of grog If a man was suffering pains of any kind or was
being stretched on the rack I never knew what a rack was till Id time
for reading in gaol except a horserack or was being flogged and
a glass of anything he could swallow would make him think he was on a
feather bed enjoying a pleasant doze wouldnt he swig it off do you
think And suppose there are times when a man feels as if hell couldnt
be much worse than what hes feeling all the long day throughand I
tell you there areI who have often stood it hour after hourwont he
drink then And why shouldnt he

We began to find that towards the end of the day we all of us found the
way to fathers brandy kegthat by nightfall the whole lot of us had
quite as much as we could stagger under I dont say we regularly went
in for drinking but we began to want it by twelve oclock every day
and to keep things going after that till bedtime In the morning we felt
nervous and miserable on the whole we werent very gay till the sun was
over the foreyard

Anyhow we made it up to clear out and have the first goin for a touch
on the southern line the next week as ever was Father was as eager for
it as anybody He couldnt content himself with this sort of Robinson
Crusoe life any longer and said he must have a run and a bit of work
of some sort or hed go mad This was on the Saturday night Well on
Sunday we sent Warrigal out to meet one of our telegraphs at a place
about twenty miles off and to bring us any information he could pick
up and a newspaper He came back about sundown that evening and told
us that the police had been all over the country after us and that
Government had offered 200 Pounds reward for our apprehensionmine and
Starlightswith 50 Pounds each for Warrigal and Jim They had an idea
wed all shipped for America He sent us a newspaper There was some
news that is news worth talking about Here was what was printed in
large letters on the outside


 WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF GOLD AT THE TURON

We have much pleasure in informing our numerous constituents that
gold similar in character and value to that of San Francisco has
been discovered on the Turon River by those energetic and experienced
practical miners Messrs Hargraves and party The method of cradling
is the same the appliances required are simple and inexpensive and
the proportional yield of gold highly reassuring It is impossible
to forecast the results of this most momentous discovery It will
revolutionise the new world It will liberate the old It will
precipitate Australia into a nation

Meanwhile numberless inconveniences even privations will ariseto be
endured unflinchinglyto be borne in silence But courage England we
have hitherto achieved victory


This news about the gold breaking out in such a place as the Turon
made a great difference in our notions We hardly knew what to think at
first The whole country seemed upside down Warrigal used to sneak out
from time to time and come back openmouthed bringing us all sorts
of news Everybody he said was coming up from Sydney There would be
nobody left there but the Governor What a queer startthe Governor
sitting lonely in a silent Government House in the middle of a deserted
city We found out that it was true after wed made one or two short
rides out ourselves Afterwards the police had a deal too much to do to
think of us We didnt run half the chance of being dropped on to that
we used to do The whole country was full of absconders and deserters
servants shepherds shopmen soldiers and sailorsall running away
from their work and making in a blind sort of way for the diggings
like a lot of caterpillars on the march

We had more than half a notion about going there ourselves but we
turned it over in our minds and thought it wouldnt do We should be
sure to be spotted anywhere in New South Wales All the police stations
had our descriptions posted up with a reward in big letters on the
door Even if we were pretty lucky at the start we should always be
expecting them to drop on us As it was we should have twenty times the
chance among the coaches that were sure to be loaded full up with men
that all carried cash more or less you couldnt travel then in
the country without it We had twice the pull now because so many
strangers that couldnt possibly be known to the police were
straggling over all the roads There was no end of bustle and rush in
every line of work and labour Money was that plentiful that everybody
seemed to be full of it Gold began to be sent down in big lots by the
Escort as it was calledsometimes ten thousand ounces at a time That
was money if you likedforty thousand poundsenough to make ones
mouth waterto make one think dads prophecy about the ten thousand
pounds wasnt so far out after all

Just at the start most people had a kind of notion that the gold would
only last a short time and that things would be worse than before But
it lasted a deal longer than any of us expected It was 1850 that Im
talking about Its getting on for 1860 now and there seems more of it
about than ever there was

Most of our lives wed been used to the southern road and we kept to it
still It wasnt right in the line of the gold diggings but it wasnt
so far off It was a queer start when the news got round about to the
other colonies after that to England and I suppose all the other old
world places but they must have come by shiploads the road was that
full of new chumswe could tell em easy by their dress their fresh
faces their way of talk their thick sticks and new guns and pistols
Some of them youd see dragging a handcart with another chap and they
having all their goods tools and clothes on it Then thered be a
dozen men with a horse and cart and all their swags in it If the
horse jibbed at all or stuck in the deep rutsand wasnt it a wet
seasontheyd give a shout and a rush and tear out cart and horse and
everything else They told us that there were rows of ships in Sydney
Harbour without a soul to take care of them that the soldiers were
running away to the diggings just as much as the sailors clergymen and
doctors old hands and new chums merchants and lawyers They all seemed
as if they couldnt keep away from the diggings that first year for
their lives

All stock went up double and treble what they were before Cattle and
sheep we didnt mind about We could do without them now But the horse
market rose wonderfully and that made a deal of odds to us you may be
sure

It was this way Every man that had a few pounds wanted a horse to ride
or drive every miner wanted a washdirt cart and a horse to draw it
The farmer wanted working horses for wasnt hay sixty or seventy pounds
a ton and corn what you liked to ask for it Every kind of harness
horse was worth forty fifty a hundred pounds apiece and only to ask
it some of em weedy and bad enough Heaven knows So between the horse
trade and the road trade we could see a fortune sticking out ready for
us to catch hold of whenever we were ready to collar




Chapter 24



Our first tryon in the coach line was with the Goulburn mail We knew
the road pretty well and picked out a place where they had to go slow
and couldnt get off the road on either side Theres always places like
that in a coach road near the coast if you look sharp and lay it out
beforehand This wasnt on the track to the diggings but we meant to
leave that alone till we got our hand in a bit There was a lot of money
flying about the country in a general way where there was no sign of
gold All the storekeepers began to get up fresh goods and to send
money in notes and cheques to pay for them The price of stock kept
dealers and fat cattle buyers moving who had their pockets full of
notes as often as not

Just as you got nearly through Bargo Brush on the old road there was a
stiffish hill that the coach passengers mostly walked up to save
the horsesfenced in too with a nearly new threerail fence all
ironbark and not the sort of thing that you could ride or drive over
handy We thought this would be as good a place as we could pick so we
laid out the whole thing as careful as we could beforehand

The three of us started out from the Hollow as soon as we could see in
the morning a Friday it was I remember it pretty wellgood reason I
had too Father and Warrigal went up the night before with the horses
we were to ride They camped about twenty miles on the line we were
going at a place where there was good feed and water but well out of
the way and on a lonely road There had been an old sheep station there
and a hut but the old man had been murdered by the hutkeeper for some
money he had saved and a story got up that it was haunted by his ghost
It was known as the Murdering Hut and no shepherd would ever live
there after so it was deserted We werent afraid of shepherds alive or
dead so it came in handy for us as there was water and feed in an old
lambing paddock Besides the road to it was nearly all a lot of rock
and scrub from the Hollow that made it an unlikely place to be tracked
from

Our dodge was to take three quiet horses from the Hollow and ride them
there first thing then pick up our own threeRainbow and two other
outandoutersand ride bang across the southern road When things were
over we were to start straight back to the Hollow We reckoned to be
safe there before the police had time to know which way wed made

It all fitted in firstrate We cracked on for the Hollow in the morning
early and found dad and Warrigal all ready for us The horses were in
great buckle and carried us over to Bargo easy enough before dark We
camped about a mile away from the road in as thick a place as we could
find where we made ourselves as snug as things would allow We had
brought some grub with us and a bottle of grog half of which we
finished before we started out to spend the evening We hobbled the
horses out and let them have an hours picking They were likely to want
all they could get before they saw the Hollow again

It was near twelve oclock when we mounted Starlight said

By Jove boys its a pity we didnt belong to a troop of irregular
horse instead of this rotten colonial Dick Turpin business that one
cant help being ashamed of They would have been delighted to have
recruited the three of us as we ride and our horses are worth best
part of ten thousand rupees What a tentpegger Rainbow would have made
eh old boy he said patting the horses neck But Fate wont have
it and its no use whining

The coach was to pass halfanhour after midnight An awful long time
to wait it seemed We finished the bottle of brandy I know I thought
they never would come when all of a sudden we saw the lamp

Up the hill they came slow enough About halfway up they stopped and
most of the passengers got out and walked up after her As they came
closer to us we could hear them laughing and talking and skylarking
like a lot of boys They didnt think who was listening You wont be
so jolly in a minute or two I thinks to myself

They were near the top when Starlight sings out Stand Bail up and
the three of us all masked showed ourselves You never saw a man look
so scared as the passenger on the boxseat a stout jolly commercial
whod been giving the coachman Havana cigars and yarning and nipping
with him at every house they passed Bill Webster the driver pulls up
all standing when he sees what was in Starlights hand and holds the
reins so loose for a minute I thought theyd drop out of his hands I
went up to the coach There was no one insideonly an old woman and a
young one They seemed struck all of a heap and couldnt hardly speak
for fright

The best of the joke was that the passengers started running up full
split to warm themselves and came bump against the coach before they
found out what was up One of them had just opened out for a bit of
blowing Billy old man he says Ill report you to the Company if
you crawl along this way when he catches sight of me and Starlight
standing still and silent with our revolvers pointing his way By
George I could hardly help laughing His jaw dropped and he couldnt
get a word out His throat seemed quite dry

Now gentlemen says Starlight quite cool and cheerfullike you
understand her Majestys mail is stuck up to use a vulgar expression
and theres no use resisting I must ask you to stand in a row there by
the fence and hand out all the loose cash watches or rings you may
have about you Dont move dont I say sir or I must fire This
was to a fidgety nervous man who couldnt keep quiet Now Number
One fetch down the mail bags Number Two close up here

Here Jim walked up revolver in hand and Starlight begins at the first
man very stern

Hand out your cash keep back nothing if you value your life

You never saw a man in such a funk He was a storekeeper we found
afterwards He nearly dropped on his knees Then he handed Starlight a
bundle of notes a gold watch and took a handsome diamond ring from
his finger This Starlight put into his pocket He handed the notes and
watch to Jim who had a leather bag ready for them The man sank down on
the ground he had fainted

He was left to pick himself up No 2 was told to shell out They all
had something Some had sovereigns some had notes and small cheques
which are as good in a country place The squatters draw too many to
know the numbers of half that are out so theres no great chance of
their being stopped There were eighteen male passengers besides
the chap on the boxseat We made him come down By the time wed got
through them all it was best part of an hour

I pulled the mail bags through the fence and put them under a tree Then
Starlight went to the coach where the two women were He took off his
hat and bowed

Unpleasant necessity madam most painful to my feelings altogether I
assure you I must really ask youahis the young lady your daughter
madam

Not at all says the oldest stout middleaged woman I never set
eyes on her before

Indeed madam says Starlight bowing again excuse my curiosity I
am desolated I assure you but may I trouble you for your watches and
purses

As youre a gentleman said the fat lady I fully expected youd have
let us off Im Mrs Buxter of Bobbrawobbra

Indeed I have no words to express my regret says Starlight but my
dear lady hard necessity compels me Thanks very much he said to the
young girl

She handed over a small old Geneva watch and a little purse The plump
lady had a gold watch with a chain and purse to match

Is that all says he trying to speak stern

Its my very all says the girl five pounds Mother gave me her
watch and I shall have no money to take me to Bowning where I am going
to a situation

Her lips shook and trembled and the tears came into her eyes

Starlight carefully handed Mrs Buxters watch and purse to Jim I saw
him turn round and open the other purse and he put something in if I
didnt mistake Then he looked in again

Im afraid Im rather impertinent says he but your face
MissahElmsdale thanksreminds me of some one in another worldthe
one I once lived in Allow me to enjoy the souvenir and to return your
effects No thanks that smile is ample payment Ladies I wish you a
pleasant journey

He bowed Mrs Buxter did not smile but looked cross enough at the
young lady who poor thing seemed pretty full up and inclined to cry
at the surprise

Now then all aboard sings out Starlight get in gentlemen our
business matters are concluded for the night Better luck next time
William you had better drive on Send back from the next stage and you
will find the mail bags under that tree They shall not be injured more
than can be helped Goodnight

The driver gathered up his reins and shouted to his team that was
pretty fresh after their spell and went off like a shot We sat down
by the roadside with one of the coach lamps that we had boned and went
through all the letters putting them back after wed opened them and
popping all notes cheques and bills into Jims leather sack We did
not waste more time over our lettersorting than we could help you bet
but we were pretty well paid for itbetter than the postoffice clerks
are by all accounts We left all the mail bags in a heap under the
tree as Starlight had told the driver and then mounting our horses
rode as hard as we could lick to where dad and Warrigal were camped

When we overhauled the leather sack into which Jim had stowed all the
notes and cheques we found that wed done better than we expected
though we could see from the first it wasnt going to be a bad nights
work We had 370 Pounds in notes and gold a biggish bag of silver
a lot of chequessome of which would be sure to be paidseven gold
watches and a lot of silver ones some pretty good Mrs Buxters watch
was a real beauty with a stunning chain Starlight said he should like
to keep it himself and then I knew Bella Barnes was in for a present
Starlight was one of those chaps that never forgot any kind of promise
hed once made Once he said a thing it would be done as sure as
deathif he was alive to do it and many a time Ive known him take the
greatest lot of trouble no matter how pushed he might be to carry out
something which another man would have never troubled his head about

We got safe to the Murdering Hut and a precious hard ride it was and
tried our horses well for mind you theyd been under saddle best part
of twentyfour hours when we got back and had done a good deal over a
hundred miles We made a short halt while the tea was boiling then we
all separated for fear a black tracker might have been loosed on our
trail and knowing well what bloodhounds they are sometimes

Warrigal and Starlight went off together as usual they were pretty safe
to be out of harms way Father made off on a line of his own We took
the two horses wed ridden out of the Hollow and made for that place
the shortest way we knew We could afford to hit outhorseflesh was
cheap to usbut not to go slow Time was more than money to us nowit
was blood or next thing to it

Ill go anywhere you like says Jim stretching himself It makes no
odds to me now where we go What do you think of it dad

I think youve no call to leave here for another month anyhow but as I
suppose some folks ll play the fool some road or other you may as well
go there as anywhere else If you must go youd better take some of
these young horses with you and sell them while prices keep up

Capital idea says Starlight I was wondering how wed get those
colts off Youve the best head amongst us governor Well start out
today and muster the horses and we can take Warrigal with us as far as
Jonathan Barness place

We didnt lose time once wed made up our minds to anything So that
night all the horses were in and drafted readytwentyfive upstanding
colts well bred and in good condition We expected theyd fetch a lot
of money They were all quiet too and well broken in by Warrigal who
used to get so much a head extra for this sort of work and liked it He
could do more with a horse than any man I ever saw They never seemed to
play up with him as young horses do with other people Jim and I
could ride em easy enough when they was tackled but for handling and
catching and getting round them we couldnt hold a candle to Warrigal

The next thing was to settle how to work it when we got to the diggings
We knew the auctioneers there and everywhere else would sell a lot of
likely stock and ask no questions but there had been such a lot of
horsestealing since the diggings broke out that a law had been passed
on purpose to check it In this way If any auctioneer sold a stolen
horse and the owner claimed it before six months the auctioneer was held
liable He had to return the horse and stand the loss But they found
a way to make themselves right Men generally do if a laws over sharp
they get round it somehow or other So the auctioneers made it up among
themselves to charge ten per cent on the price of all horses that they
sold and make the buyer pay it For every ten horses they sold they
could afford to return one The proof of an animal being stolen didnt
turn up above once in fifty or a hundred times so they could well
afford the expense when it did

It wasnt an easy thing to drive horses out of the Hollow specially
those that had been bred or reared there But they were up to all that
kind of thing dad and Starlight First there was a yard at the lower
end of the gully that led up where wed first seen Starlight come down
and a line of fence across the mountain walls on both sides so that
stock once in there couldnt turn back Then they picked out a couple
or three old mares that had been years and years in the Hollow and been
used to be taken up this track and knew their way back again One they
led up dad went first with her and another followed then the colts
took the track after them as stock will In halfanhour we had them
all up at the top on the tableland and ready to be driven anywhere
The first day we meant to get most of the way to Jonathan Barness
place and to stop there and have a bit of a spell the second We
should want to spell the horses and make em up a bit as it was a
longish drive over rough country to get there Besides we wanted all
the information we could get about the diggings and other matters and
we knew Jonathan was just that openmouthed blatherskitin sort of chap
that would talk to everybody he saw and hear mostly all that was going
on

A long hard day was that first one The colts tried to make back every
now and then or something would start them and theyd make a regular
stampede for four or five miles as hard as they could lay leg to ground
It wasnt easy to live with em across broken country wellbred uns
like them as fast as racehorses for a short distance but there were
as good behind em and Warrigal was pretty nearly always near the lead
doubling and twisting and wheeling em the first bit of open ground
there was He was A1 through timber and no mistake We got to a place
father knew where there was a yard a little before dark but we took
care to watch them all night for fear of accidents It wouldnt do to
let em out of our sight about there We should never have set eyes on
em again and we knew a trick worth two of that

Next day pretty early we got to Barness where we thought we should
be welcome It was all right The old man laughed all over his face when
he saw us and the girls couldnt do enough for us when they heard wed
had scarce a morsel to eat or drink that day

Why youre looking firstrate Captain says Bella Dick I hardly
knowed yethe mountain air seems to agree with you Maddie and I
thought you was never going to look in no more Thought youd clean
forgot usdidnt we Mad Why Dick what a grand beard youve grown I
never thought you was so handsome before

I promised you a trifling present when I was here last didnt I
Bella says Starlight There He handed her a small parcel carefully
tied up It will serve to remind you of a friend

Oh what a lovely splendid duck of a watch says the girl tearing
open the parcel And what a love of a chain and lots of charms too
Where in all the world did you get this I suppose you didnt buy it
in George Street

It WAS bought in George Street says he and heres the receipt you
neednt be afraid of wearing it to church or anywhere else Heres Mr
Flavelles name all straight and square Its quite new as you can
see

Jim and I stared Dad was outside seeing the horses fed with Warrigal
We made sure at first it was Mrs Buxters watch and chain but he knew
better than to give the girl anything that she could be brought into
trouble for wearing if it was identified on her so hed sent the cash
down to Sydney and got the watch sent up to him by one of fathers
pals It was as right as the bank and nobody could touch it or her
either That was Starlight all over he never seemed to care much
for himself As to anything he told a woman shed no call to trouble
herself about whether it would be done or not

Itll be my turn next says Maddie I cant afford to wait
tilltillthe Captain leaves me that beauty horse of his Its too
long I might be married before that and my old man cut up rough Jim
Marston what are you going to give me I havent got any earrings worth
looking at except these gold hoops that everybody knows

All right says Jim Ill give you and Bell a pair each if youre
good girls when we sell the horses unless were nailed at the Turon
What sort of a shop is it Are they getting much gold

Digging it out like potatoes says Bella so a young chap told us
that come this way last week My word didnt he go on about the coach
being stuck up Mad and I nearly choked ourselves laughing We made him
tell it over twice He said a friend of his was in itin the coach
that isand we could have told him friends of ours was in it too
couldnt we

And what did he think of it all

Oh he was a new chum hadnt been a year out Not a bad cut of a young
feller He was awful shook on Mad but she wouldnt look at him He said
if it was in England the whole countryside would rise up and hunt such
scoundrels down like mad dogs but in a colony like this people didnt
seem to know right from wrong

Did he indeed says Starlight Ingenuous youth When he lives a
little longer hell find that people in England and indeed everywhere
else are very much like they are here Theyll wink at a little
robbery or take a hand themselves if its made worth their while And
what became of your English friend

Oh he said he was going on to Port Phillip Theres a big diggings
broke out there too he says and he has some friends there and he
thinks hell like that side better

I think wed better cut the Sydney side too says Starlight
What do you say Maddie Well be able to mix up with these new chum
Englishmen and Americans that are coming here in swarms and puzzle
Sergeant Goring and his troopers more than ever

Oh come now that would be mean says Maddie I wouldnt be drove
away from my own part of the country if I was a man by anybody Id
stay and fight it out Goring was here the other day and tried to pick
out something from father and us about the lot of you

Ha says Starlight his face growing dark and differentlooking about
the eyes from what Id ever seen him did he Hed better beware He
may follow up my trail once too often And what did you tell him

We told him a lot of things says the girl but I am afeared they was
none of em true He didnt get much out of us nor wouldnt if he was
to come once a week

I expect not says Jim you girls are smart enough Theres no man
in the police or out of it thatll take much change out of you Im most
afraid of your father though letting the cat out of the bag hes such
an old duffer to blow

He was nearly telling the sergeant hed seen a better horse lately here
than his famous chestnut Marlborough only Bella trod on his toe and
told him the cows was in the wheat Of course Goring would have dropped
it was Rainbow or some wellbred horse you chaps have been shaking
lately

Youre a regular pearl of discretion my dear says Starlight and
its a pity like some other folks you havent a better field for the
exercise of your talents However thats very often the way in this
world as youll perhaps find out when youre old and ugly and the
knowledge cant do you any good Tell us all you heard about the coach
accident

My word it was the greatest lark out says Maddie Shed twice the
fun in her the other had and was that goodtempered nothing seemed to
put her out Everybody as come here seemed to have nothing else to talk
about Those that was going to the diggings too took it much easier
than those that was coming away

How was that

Well the chaps that come away mostly have some gold They showed us
some pretty fair lumps and nuggets I can tell you They seemed awfully
gallied about being stuck up and robbed of it and theyd heard yarns of
men being tied to trees in the bush and left there to die

Tell them for me my fair Madeline that Starlight and Company dont
deal with single diggers ours is a wholesale businesseh Dick We
leave the retail robbery to meaner villains

We had the horses that quiet by this time that we could drive them the
rest of the way to the Turon by ourselves We didnt want to be too big
a mob at Barness house Any one might come in accidental and it might
get spread about So after supper Warrigal was sent back we didnt want
his help any more and he might draw attention The way we were to take
in the horses and sell them was all put up

Jim and I were to drive them the rest of the way across the ranges to
the Turon Barnes was to put us on a track he knew that would take us in
all right and yet keep away from the regular highway Starlight was to
stay another day at Barness keeping very quiet and making believe if
any one came to be a gentleman from Port Phillip that wasnt very well
Hed come in and see the horses sold but gammon to be a stranger and
never set eyes on us before

My word said Barnes who just came in at the time youve made talk
enough for all the countryside with that mail coach racket of yours
Every man woman and child that looks in heres sure to say Did
you hear about the Goulburn mail being stuck up Well I did hear
something I says and out it all comes They wonder first whether the
bushrangers will be caught where theyre gone to that the police cant
get em how it was that one of em was so kind to the young lady as to
give her new watch back and whether Captain Starlight was as handsome
as people say and if Mrs Buxter will ever get her watch back with the
big reward the Government offered More than that whether theyll stick
up more coaches or fly the country

Id like to have been there and see how Bill Webster looked says
Maddie He was here one day since and kept gassin about it all as if
he wouldnt let none of you do only what he liked I didnt think he was
that game and told him so He said Id better take a seat some day and
see how I liked it I asked him wasnt they all very goodlooking chaps
and he said Starlight was genteellookin but there was one great big
roughlookin fellerthat was you Jimas was ugly enough to turn a
cask of beer sour

Ill give him a hammerin for that yet grumbles old Jim My word
he was that shaky and bluelookin he didnt know whether I was white or
black

We had a great spree that night in a quiet way and got all the fun as
was to be had under the circumstances Barnes came out with some pretty
good wine which Starlight shouted for all round The old woman cooked
us a stunning good dinner which we made the girls sit down to and some
cousins of theirs that lived close by We were merry enough before the
evening was out Bella Barnes played the piano middling and Maddie
could sing firstrate and all of them could dance The last thing I
recollect was Starlight showing Maddie what he called a minuet step and
Jonathan and the old woman sitting on the sofa as grave as owls

Anyhow we all enjoyed ourselves It was a grand change after being so
long alone The girls romped and laughed and pretended to be offended
every now and then but we had a regular good lark of it and didnt
feel any the worse at daylight next morning

Jim and I were away before sunrise and after wed once got on the road
that Jonathan showed us we got on well enough We were dressed just like
common bushmen There were plenty on the road just then bringing cattle
and horses to the diggings It was well known that high prices were
going there and that everybody paid in cash No credit was given of
course

We had on blue serge shirts moleskin trousers and roughish leather
gaiters that came up to the knee with ponchos strapped on in front
inside them was a spare shirt or two we had oldish felt hats as if
wed come a good way Our saddles and bridles were rustylooking and
worn the horses were the only things that were a little too good and
might bring the police to suspect us We had to think of a yarn about
them We looked just the same as a hundred other longlegged sixfoot
natives with our beards and hair pretty wildneither better nor worse

As soon as Starlight came on to the Turon he was to rig himself out as a
regular swell and gammon hed just come out from England to look at the
goldfields He could do that part wonderfully well We would have backed
him to take in the devil himself if he saw him let alone goldfields
police if Sergeant Goring wasnt about

The second day Jim and I were driving quietly and easy on the road the
colts trotting along as steady as old stock horses and feeding a bit
every now and then We knew we were getting near the Turon so many
tracks came in from all parts and all went one way All of a sudden we
heard a low rumbling roaring noise something like the tide coming in
on the seashore

I say Jim old man we havent made any mistakecrossed over the main
range and got back to the coast have we

Not likely he said but what the deuce is that row I cant reckon
it up for the life of me

I studied and studied On it went grinding and rattling like all the
round pebbles in the world rolling on a beach with a tidy surf on I
tumbled at last

Remember that thing with the two rockers we saw at the Hermits Hut in
the Hollow I said to Jim We couldnt make out what it was I know
now it was a gold cradle and theres hundreds and thousands rocking
there at the Turon Thats whats the matter

Were going to see some life it strikes me says he Well know it
all directly But the first thing weve got to do is to shut these young
uns up safe in the saleyard Then we can knock round this town in
comfort

We went outside of a rocky point and sure enough here was the first
Australian golddiggings in full blast What a sight it was to be sure
Jim and I sat in our saddles while the horses went to work on the green
grass of the flat and stared as if wed seen a bit of another world So
it was another world to us straight away from the sadvoiced solitudes
of the bush

Barring Sydney or Melbourne wed never seen so many men in a crowd
before and how different they looked from the crawling people of a
town A greenbanked rapid river ran before us through a deep narrow
valley The bright green flats looked so strange with the yellow water
rippling and rushing between them Upon that small flat and by the
bank and in the river itself nearly 20000 men were at work harder
and more silently than any crowd wed ever seen before Most of em were
digging winding up greenhide buckets filled with gravel from shafts
which were sunk so thickly all over the place that you could not pass
between without jostling some one Others were driving carts heavily
laden with the same stuff towards the river in which hundreds of men
were standing up to their waists washing the gold out of tin pans iron
buckets and every kind of vessel or utensil By far the greater number
of miners used things like childs cradles rocking them to and fro
while a constant stream of yellow water passed through Very little
talk went on every man looked feverishly anxious to get the greatest
quantity of work done by sundown

Foot police and mounted troopers passed through the crowd every now and
then but there was apparently no use or no need for them that time
was to come Now and then some one would come walking up carrying a
knapsack not a swag and showing by his round rosy face that he hadnt
seen a summers sun in Australia We saw a trooper riding towards us
and knowing it was best to take the bull by the horns I pushed over
to him and asked if he could direct us to where Mr Stevensons the
auctioneers yard was

Whose horses are these he said looking at the brands BM isnt
it

Bernard Muldoon Lower Macquarie I answered Theres a friend of
his a new chum in charge hell be here tomorrow

Go on down Main Street the first street in a diggings is always called
Main Street as youre going he said carelessly giving us all a
parting look through and take the first lane to the right It takes
you to the yard Its saleday tomorrow youre in luck

It was rather sharp work getting the colts through men women and
children carts cradles shafts and tin dishes but they were a trifle
tired and tenderfooted so in less than twenty minutes they were all
inside of a high yard where they could scarcely see over the cap with
a row of loose boxes and stalls behind We put em into Joe Stevensons
hands to sellthat was what every one called the auctioneerand walked
down the long street

My word we were stunned and no mistake about it There was nothing to
see but a rocky river and a flat deep down between hills like wed seen
scores and scores of times all our lives and thought nothing of and
here they were digging gold out of it in all directions just like
potatoes as Maddie Barnes said Some of the lumps we sawnuggets they
called emwas near as big as new potatoes without a word of a lie
in it I couldnt hardly believe it but I saw them passing the little
washleather bags of gold dust and lumps of dirty yellow gravel but
heavier from one to the other just as if they were nothingnearly 4
Pounds an ounce they said it was all worth or a trifle under It licked
me to think it had been hid away all the time and not even the blacks
found it out I believe our blacks are the stupidest laziest beggars
in the whole world That old man who lived and died in the Hollow
thoughHE must have known about it and the queerlooking thing with
the rockers we saw near his hut that was the first cradle ever was made
in Australia

The big man of the goldfield seemed to be the Commissioner We saw him
come riding down the street with a couple of troopers after his heels
looking as if all the place and the gold too belonged to him He had
to settle all the rows and disputes that came up over the gold and the
boundaries of the claims as they called the twentyfoot paddocks they
all washed in and a nice time he must have had of it However he was
pretty smart and quick about it The diggers used to crowd round and
kick up a bit of a row sometimes when two lots of men were fighting for
the same claim and gold coming up close by but what he said was law
and no mistake When he gave it out they had to take it and be content
Then he used to ride away and not trouble his head any more about it
and after a bit of barneying it all seemed to come right Men liked to
be talked to straight and no shillyshally

What I didnt like so much was the hunting about of the poor devils that
had not got what they called a licencea printed thing giving em leave
for to dig gold on the Crown lands This used to cost a pound or thirty
shillings a monthI forget rightly whichand of course some of
the chaps hadnt the money to get it withspent what they had been
unlucky or run away from somewhere and come up as bare of everything
to get it out of the ground

Youd see the troopers asking everybody for their licences and those
that hadnt them would be marched up to the police camp and chained to a
big log sometimes for days and days The Government hadnt time to get
up a lockup with cells and all the rest of it so they had to do the
chain business Some of these men had seen better days and felt it
the other diggers didnt like it either and growled a good deal among
themselves We could see it would make bad blood some day but there was
such a lot of gold being got just then that people didnt bother their
heads about anything more than they could helpplenty of gold plenty
of money people bringing up more things every day from the towns for
the use of the diggers You could get pretty near anything you wanted by
paying for it Hard work from daylight to dark with every now and then
a big find to sweeten it when a man could see as much money lying at
his foot or in his hand as a years workno nor fivehadnt made
for him before No wonder people were not in a hurry to call out for
change in a place like the Turon in the year 1850

The first night put the stuns on us Long rows of tents with big
roaring log fires in front hot enough to roast you if you went too near
mobs of men talking singing chaffing dealingall as jolly as a lot
of schoolboys There was grog too going as there is everywhere No
publics were allowed at first so of course it was sold on the sly

Its no use trying to make men do without grog or the means of getting
it it never works I dont hold with every shanty being licensed and
its being under a mans nose all day long but if he has the money to
pay for it and wants to have an extra glass of grog or two with his
friends or because he has other reasons he ought to be able to get it
without hardships being put in his way

The Government was afraid of there being tremendous fights and riots at
the diggings because there was all sorts of people there English
and French Spaniards and Italians natives and Americans Greeks and
Germans Swedes and negroes every sort and kind of man from every
country in the world seemed to come after a bit But they neednt
have been frightened at the diggers As far as we saw they were the
sensiblest lot of working men we ever laid eyes on not at all inclined
to make a row for nothingquite the other way But the shutting off of
publichouses led to sly grog tents where they made the digger pay a
pound a bottle for his grog and didnt keep it very good either

When the police found a sly grog tent they made short work of it I
will say Jim and I were close by and saw them at the fun Somebody had
informed on the man or they had some other reason so they rode down
about a dozen troopers with the Commissioner at their head He went in
and found two casks of brandy and one of rum besides a lot of bottled
stuff They didnt want that for their own use he believed

First he had the heads knocked in of the hogsheads then all the bottled
wine and spirits were unpacked and stowed in a cart while the straw
was put back in the tent Then the men and women were ordered to come
outside and a trooper set fire to the straw In five minutes the tent
and everything in it was a mass of flame

There was a big crowd gathered round outside They began to groan when
the trooper lit the straw but they did nothing and went quietly home
after a bit We had the horses to see after next day Just before
the sale began at twelve oclock and a goodish crowd had turned up
Starlight rides quietly up the finest picture of a new chum you ever
set eyes on Jim and I could hardly keep from bursting out laughing

He had brought up a quiet cobby sort of stock horse from the Hollow
plain enough but a wonder to go particularly over broken country Of
course it didnt do to bring Rainbow out for such work as this For
a wonder he had a short tail Well hed squared this cobs tail and
hogged his mane so that he looked like another animal He was pretty
fat too

He was dressed up to the nines himself and if we didnt expect him we
wouldnt have known him from a crow First of all he had a thick rough
suit of tweed clothing on all the same colour with a round felt hat
He had a bran new saddle and bridle that hadnt got the yellow rubbed
off them yet He had an English hunting whip in his hand and brown
dogskin gloves He had tan leather gaiters that buttoned up to his
knees Hed shaved his beard all but his moustache and a pair of short
whiskers

He had an eyeglass in his eye which he let drop every now and then
putting it up when he wanted to look at anybody

When he rode up to the yard everybody stared at him and one or two of
the diggers laughed and began to call out Joe Jim and I thought how
sold some of them would have been if he turned on them and theyd found
out who it was However he pushed up to the auctioneer without looking
out right or left and drawled

May Ierask if you are MrerJoseph Stevenson

Im Joe Stevenson says the auctioneer What can I do for you

Ohahere is a letter from my friend Mr Bernard Muldoon of
the Lower Macquarieerrequesting you to sell these horses faw him
anderhand over the pwoceeds toermeMr Augustus Gwanbyaw

Stevenson read the letter nodded his head said All right Ill
attend to it and went on with the sale

It didnt take long to sell our colts There were some draught stock
to come afterwards and Joe had a days work before him But ours sold
well There had not been anything like this for size quality and
condition The Commissioner sent down and bought one The Inspector of
Police was there and bought one recommended by Starlight They fetched
high prices from fifty to eightyfive guineas and they came to a
fairish figure the lot

When the last horse was sold Starlight says I feel personally obliged
to you MrawStevensonfaw the highly satisfactory manner in which
you have conducted the sale and I shall inform my friend Mr Muldoon
of the way you have sold his stock

Much obliged sir says Joe touching his hat Come inside and Ill
give you the cheque

Quite unnecessary now says Starlight but as Im acting for a
friend it may be as well

We saw him pocket the cheque and ride slowly over to the bank which
was halftent halfbark hut

We didnt think it safe to stay on the Turon an hour longer than we were
forced to do We had seen the diggings and got a good notion of what
the whole thing was like sold the horses and got the money that was
the principal thing Nothing for it now but to get back to the Hollow
Something would be sure to be said about the horses being sold and
when it came out that they were not Muldoons there would be a great
flareup Still they could not prove that the horses were stolen There
wasnt a wrong brand or a faked one in the lot And no one could swear
to a single head of them though the whole lot were come by on the
cross and father could have told who owned every one among them That
was curious wasnt it

We put in a night at Jonathan Barness on our way back Maddie got the
earrings and Bella the making of a new riding habit which she had been
wanting and talking about for a good while Starlight dressed up and
did the new chum young Englishman eyeglass and all over again and
repeated the conversation he had with the Inspector of Police about
his friend Mr Muldoons illness and the colts he recommended It was
grand and the girls laughed till they cried again Well those were
merry days we DID have a bit of fun sometimes and if the devil was
dogging us he kept a good way out of sight Its his way at the start
when fellows take the downward track

     

We got back safe enough and father opened his eyes when he saw the
roll of notes Starlight counted over as the price of the colts
Horsebreedings our best game says the old man if theyre going to
pay such prices as this Ive half a mind to start and take a lot over
to Port Phillip




Chapter 25



Our next chance came through father He was the intelligence man and
had all the news sent to himroundabout it might be but it always
came and was generally true and the old man never troubled anybody
twice that he couldnt believe in great things or small Well word was
passed about a branch bank at a place called Ballabri where a goodish
bit of gold was sent to wait the monthly escort There was only the
manager and one clerk there now the other cove having gone away on sick
leave Towards the end of the month the bank gold was heaviest and the
most notes in the safe The smartest way would be to go into the bank
just before shuttingup timethree oclock aboutand hand a cheque
over the counter While the clerk was looking at it out with a revolver
and cover him The rest was easy enough A couple more walked in after
and while one jumped over the counter and bailed up the manager the
other shut the door Nothing strange about that The door was always
shut at three oclock sharp Nobody in town would drop to what might be
going on inside till the whole thing was over and the swag ready to be
popped into a light trap and cleared off with

That was the idea We had plenty of time to think it over and settle it
all bit by bit beforehand

So one morning we started early and took the job in hand Every little
thing was looked through and talked over a week before Father got Mr
Whites buggyhorses ready and took Warrigal with him to a place where
a man met him with a light fourwheeled Yankee trap and harness Dad was
dressed up to look like a backcountry squatter Lots of em were quite
as roughlooking as he was though they drive as good horses as any
gentleman in the land Warrigal was togged out something like a groom
with a bit of the stationhand about him Their saddles and bridles they
kept with em in the trap they didnt know when they might want them
They had on their revolvers underneath their coats We were to go round
by another road and meet at the township

Well everything turned out firstrate When we got to Ballabri there
was father walking his horses up and down They wanted cooling my word
Theyd come pretty smart all the way but they were middlin soft being
in great grass condition and not having done any work to speak of for a
goodish while and being a bit above themselves in a manner of speaking
We couldnt help laughing to see how solemn and respectable dad looked

My word said Jim if he aint the dead image of old Mr Carter of
Brahway where we shore three years back Just such another hardfaced
crankylooking old chap aint he Dick Im that proud of him Id do
anything he asked me now blest if I wouldnt

Your fathers a remarkable man says Starlight quite serious must
have made his way in life if he hadnt shown such a dislike to anything
on the square If hed started a publichouse and a pound about the time
he turned his mind to cattleduffing as one of the fine arts hed have
had a bank account by this time that would have kept him as honest as
a judge But its the old story I say where are the police quarters
Its only manners to give them a call

We rode over to the barracks They werent much A fourroomed cottage
a log lockup with two cells a fourstalled stable and a horseyard
Ballabri was a small township with a few big stations a good many farms
about it and rather more publichouses than any other sort of buildings
in it A writing chap said once A large wellfilled graveyard a small
church mostly locked up six publichouses gave the principal features
of Ballabri township The remaining ones appear to be sand bones and
broken bottles with a sprinkling of inebriates and blackfellows With
all that there was a lot of business done there in a year by the stores
and inns particularly since the diggings Whatever becomes of the money
made in such places Where does it all go to Nobody troubles their
heads about that

A goodish lot of the first people was huddled away in the graveyard
under the sand ridges Many an old shepherd had hobbled into the
Travellers Rest with a big cheque for a fortnights spree and had
stopped behind in the graveyard too for company It was always a
wonderful place for steadying lushingtons was Ballabri

Anyhow we rode over to the barracks because we knew the senior constable
was away Wed got up a sham horsestealing case the day before through
some chaps there that we knew This drawed him off about fifty mile The
constable left behind was a youngish chap and we intended to have a bit
of fun with him So we went up to the gardengate and called out for the
officer in charge of police quite grand

Here I am says he coming out buttoning up his uniform coat Is
anything the matter

Oh not much says I but theres a man sick at the Sportsmans Arms
Hes down with the typhus fever or something Hes a mate of ours and
weve come from Mr Grants station He wants a doctor fetched

Wait a minute till I get my revolver says he buttoning up his
waistcoat He was just fresh from the depot plucky enough but not up
to half the ways of the bush

Youll do very well as you are says Starlight bringing out his
pretty sharp and pointing it full at his head You stay there till I
give you leave

He stood there quite stunned while Jim and I jumped off and muzzled
him He hadnt a chance of course with one of us on each side and
Starlight threatening to shoot him if he raised a finger

Lets put him in the logs says Jim My word just for a lark turn
for turn Fair play young fellow Youre being run in yourself now
Dont make a row and no onell hurt you

The keys were hanging up inside so we pushed him into the farthest cell
and locked both doors There were no windows and the lockup like
most bush ones was built of heavy logs just roughly squared with the
ceiling the same sort so there wasnt much chance of his making himself
heard If any noise did come out the town people would only think it was
a drunken man and take no notice

We lost no time then and Starlight rode up to the bank first It was
about ten minutes to three oclock Jim and I popped our horses into the
police stables and put on a couple of their waterproof capes The day
was a little showery Most of the people we heard afterwards took us for
troopers from some other station on the track of bushrangers and not
in regular uniform It wasnt a bad joke though and the police got
well chaffed about it

We dodged down very careless like to the bank and went in a minute or
two after Starlight He was waiting patiently with the cheque in his
hand till some old woman got her money She counted it shillings
pence and all and then went out The next moment Starlight pushed his
cheque over The clerk looks at it for a moment and quicklike says
How will you have it

This way Starlight answered pointing his revolver at his head and
dont you stir or Ill shoot you before you can raise your hand

The managers room was a small den at one side They dont allow much
room in country banks unless they make up their mind to go in for a
regular swell building I jumped round and took charge of the young
man Jim shut and locked the front door while Starlight knocked at the
managers room He came out in a hurry expecting to see one of the
bank customers When he saw Starlights revolver his face changed quick
enough but he made a rush to his drawer where he kept his revolver and
tried to make a fight of it only we were too quick for him Starlight
put the muzzle of his pistol to his forehead and swore hed blow out his
brains there and then if he didnt stop quiet We had to use the same
words over and over again Jim used to grin sometimes They generally
did the business though so of course he was quite helpless We hadnt
to threaten him to find the key of the safe because it was unlocked and
the key in it He was just locking up his gold and the days cash as we
came in

We tied him and the young fellow fast legs and arms and laid them down
on the floor while we went through the place There was a good lot of
gold in the safe all weighed and labelled ready for the escort which
called there once a month Bundles of notes too bags of sovereigns
silver and copper The last we didnt take But all the rest we bundled
up or put into handy boxes and bags we found there Father had come
up by this time as close as he could to the backyard We carried
everything out and put them into his expresswaggon he shoved a rug
over them and drove off quite easy and comfortable We locked the back
door of the bank and chucked away the key first telling the manager not
to make a row for ten minutes or we might have to come back again He
was a plucky fellow and we hadnt been rough with him He had sense
enough to see that he was overmatched and not to fight when it was
no good Ive known bankers to make a regular good fight of it and
sometimes come off best when their places was stuck up but not when
they were bested from the very start like this one No man could
have had a show if he was two or three men in one at the Ballabri
moneyshop We walked slap down to the hotelthen it was near the
bankand called for drinks There werent many people in the streets at
that time in the afternoon and the few that did notice us didnt think
we were any one in particular Since the diggings broke out all sorts
of travellers a little out of the common were wandering all about the
countryspeculators in mines strangers new chums of all kinds even
the cattledrovers and stockmen having their pockets full of money
began to put on more side and dress in a flash way The bush people
didnt take half the notice of strangers they would have done a couple
of years before

So we had our drinks and shouted for the landlord and the people in
the bar walked up to the police station took out our horses and rode
quickly off while father was nearly five miles away on a crossroad
making Mr Whites trotters do their best time and with seven or eight
thousand pounds worth of gold and cash under the driving seat That I
often think was about the smartest trick we ever did It makes me laugh
when I remember how savage the senior constable was when he came home
found his sub in a cell the manager and his clerk just untied the bank
robbed of nearly everything and us gone hours ago with about as much
chance of catching us as a mob of wild cattle that got out of the yard
the night before

Just about dark father made the place where the man met him with the
trap before Fresh horses was put in and the man drove slap away another
road He and Warrigal mounted the two brown horses and took the stuff in
saddlebags which theyd brought with em They were back at the Hollow
by daylight and we got there about an hour afterwards We only rode
sharp for the first twenty miles or so and took it easier afterwards

If sticking up the Goulburn mail made a noise in the country you may
depend the Ballabri bank robbery made ten times as much Every little
newspaper and all the big ones from one end of the colony to the other
were full of it The robbery of a bank in broad daylight almost in the
middle of the day close to a police station and with people going up
and down the streets seemed too outandout cheeky to be believed What
was the country coming to It was the fault of the gold that unsettled
young fellows minds some said and took them away from honest
industry Our minds had been unsettled long before the gold worse
luck Some shouted for more police protection some for vigilance
committees all bushrangers and horsethieves to be strung up to the
next tree The whole countryside was in an uproar except the people at
the diggings who had most of them been in other places and knew that
compared with them Australia was one of the safest countries any man
could live or travel in A good deal of fun was made out of our locking
up the constable in his own cell I believe he got blown up too and
nearly dismissed by his inspector for not having his revolver on him and
ready for use But young men that were any good were hard to get for the
police just then and his fault was passed over Its a great wonder to
me more banks were not robbed when you think of it A couple of young
fellows are sent to a country place theres no decent buildings or
anything reasonable for them to live in and theyre expected to take
care of four or five thousand pounds and a lot of gold as if it was so
many bags of potatoes If theres police theyre half their time away
The young fellows cant be all their time in the house and two or three
determined men whether theyre bushrangers or not that like to black
their faces and walk in at any time that theyre not expected can sack
the whole thing and no trouble to them I call it putting temptation in
peoples way and some of the blame ought to go on the right shoulders
As I said before the little affair made a great stir and all the
police in the country were round Ballabri for a bit tracking and
tracking till all hours night and day but they couldnt find out what
had become of the wheelmarks nor where our horse tracks led to The
man that owned the express waggon drove it into a scrubby bit of country
and left it there he knew too much to take it home Then he brought
away the wheels one by one on horseback and carted the body in a long
time after with a load of wool just before a heavy rain set in and
washed out every track as clean as a whistle

Nothing in that year could keep peoples thoughts long away from the
diggings which was just as well for us Everything but the gold was
forgotten after a week If the harbour had dried up or Sydney town been
buried by an earthquake nobody would have bothered themselves about
such trifles so long as the gold kept turning up hand over hand the way
it did There seemed no end to it New diggings jumped up every day
and now another big rush broke out in Port Phillip that sent every one
wilder than ever

Starlight and us two often used to have a quiet talk about Melbourne
We all liked that side of the country there seemed an easier chance of
getting straight away from there than any part of New South Wales where
so many people knew us and everybody was on the lookout

All kinds of things passed through our minds but the notion we liked
best was taking one of the gold ships bodily and sailing her away to a
foreign port where her name could be changed and she never heard
of again if all went well That would be a big touch and no mistake
Starlight who had been at sea and was always ready for anything out of
the way and uncommon the more dangerous the better thought it might be
done without any great risk or bother

A ship in harbour he said is something like the Ballabri bank No
one expects anything to happen in harbour consequently theres no watch
kept or any lookout thats worth much Any sudden dash with a few good
men and shed be off and out to sea before any one could say knife

Father didnt like this kind of talk He was quite satisfied where we
were We were safe there he said and as long as we kept our heads no
one need ever be the wiser how it was we always seemed to go through the
ground and no one could follow us up What did we fret after Hadnt
we everything we wanted in the worldplenty of good grub the best of
liquor and the pick of the countryside for horses besides living among
our own friends and in the country we were born in and that had the
best right to keep us If we once got among strangers and in another
colony we should be given away by some one or other and be sure to
come to grief in the long run

Well we couldnt go and cut out this ship all at once but Jim and I
didnt leave go of the notion and we had many a yarn with Starlight
about it when we were by ourselves

What made us more set upon clearing out of the country was that we
were getting a good bit of money together and of course we hadnt much
chance of spending it Every place where wed been seen was that well
watched there was no getting nigh it and every now and then a
strong mob of police ordered down by telegraph would muster at some
particular spot where they thought there was a chance of surrounding us
However that dodge wouldnt work They couldnt surround the Hollow It
was too big and the gullies between the rocks too deep You could see
across a place sometimes that you had to ride miles round to get over
Besides no one knew there was such a place leastways that we were
there any more than if we had been in New Zealand




Chapter 26



After the Ballabri affair we had to keep close for weeks and weeks The
whole place seemed to be alive with police We heard of them being on
Nulla Mountain and close enough to the Hollow now and then But Warrigal
and father had places among the rocks where they could sit up and see
everything for miles round Dad had taken care to get a good glass too
and he could sweep the country round about almost down to Rocky Flat
Warrigals eyes were sharp enough without a glass and he often used to
tell us he seen thingsmen cattle and horsesthat we couldnt make
out a bit in the world We amused ourselves for a while the best way
we could by horsebreaking shooting and what not but we began to get
awful tired of it and ready for anything no matter what that would
make some sort of change

One day father told us a bit of news that made a stir in the camp and
nearly would have Jim and me clear out altogether if wed had any place
to go to For some time past it seems dad had been grumbling about
being left to himself so much and except this last fakement not
having anything to do with the road work Its all devilish fine for
you and your brother and the Captain there to go flashin about the
country and sporting your figure on horseback while Im left alone to
do the housekeepin in the Hollow Im not going to be woodandwater
Joey I can tell ye not for you nor no other men So Ive made it right
with a couple of chaps as Ive knowd these years past and we can do a
touch now and then as well as you grand gentlemen on the high toby
as they call it where I came from

I didnt think you were such an old fool Ben said Starlight but
keeping this place here a dead secret is our sheetanchor Lose that
and well be run into in a week If you let it out to any fellow you
come across you will soon know all about it

Ive known Dan Moran and Pat Burke nigh as long as Ive known you for
the matter of that says father Theyre safe enough and theyre not
to come here or know where I hang out neither Weve other places to
meet and what we do ll be clean done Ill go bail

It doesnt matter two straws to me as Ive told you many a time said
Starlight lighting a cigar he always kept a good supply of them But
you see if Dick and Jim now dont suffer for it before long

It was as I told you about the place wasnt it growls father dont
you suppose I know how to put a man right I look to have my turn at
steering this here ship or else the crew better go ashore for good

Father had begun to drink harder now than he used that was partly
the reason And when hed got his liquor aboard he was that savage and
obstinate there was no doing anything with him We couldnt well part
We couldnt afford to do without each other So we had to patch it up
the best way we could and let him have his own way But we none of us
liked the newfangled way and made sure bad would come of it

We all knew the two men and didnt half like them They were the head
men of a gang that mostly went in for horsestealing and only did a bit
of regular bushranging when they was sure of getting clear off Theyd
never shown out the fighting way yet though they were ready enough for
it if it couldnt be helped

Moran was a dark thin wirylooking native chap with a big beard and
a nasty beady black eye like a snakes He was a wonderful man outside
of a horse and as active as a cat besides being a deal stronger than
any one would have taken him to be He had a drawling way of talking
and was one of those fellows that liked a bit of cruelty when he had the
chance I believe hed rather shoot any one than not and when he
was worked up he was more like a devil than a man Pat Burke was a
broadshouldered faircomplexioned fellow most like an Englishman
though he was a native too Hed had a small station once and might
have done well I was going to say if hed had sense enough to go
straight What rot it all is Couldnt we all have done well if the
devils of idleness and easyearned money and false pride had let us
alone

Father said his bargain with these chaps was that he should send down
to them when anything was up that more men was wanted for and they was
always to meet him at a certain place He said theyd be satisfied with
a share of whatever the amount was and that theyd never want to be
shown the Hollow or to come anigh it They had homes and places of their
own and didnt want to be known more than could be helped Besides
this if anything turned up that was real first chop they could always
find two or three more young fellows that would stand a flutter and
disappear when the job was done This was worth thinking over he said
because there werent quite enough of us for some things and we could
keep these other chaps employed at outside work

There was something in this of course and dad was generally near the
mark there or thereabouts so we let things drift One thing was that
these chaps could often lay their hands upon a goodish lot of horses or
cattle and if they delivered them to any two of us twenty miles from
the Hollow they could be popped in there and neither they or any
one else the wiser You see father didnt mind taking a hand in the
bushranging racket but his heart was with the cattle and horseduffing
that hed been used to so long and he couldnt quite give it up Its
my belief hed have sooner made a tenpound note by an unbranded colt or
a mob of fat cattle than five times as much in any other way Every man
to his taste they say

Well between this new fad of the old mans and our having a notion that
we had better keep quiet for a spell and let things settle down a bit
we had a long steady talk and the end of it was that we made up our
minds to go and put in a month or two at the diggings

We took a horse apiece that werent much account so we could either
sell them or lose them it did not make much odds which and made a
start for Jonathan Barness place We got word from him every now and
then and knew that the police had never found out that we had been
there going or coming Jonathan was a blowing blatherskiting fool but
his very foolishness in that way made them think he knew nothing at all
He had just sense enough not to talk about us and they never thought
about asking him So we thought wed have a bit of fun there before we
settled down for work at the Turon We took old saddles and bridles and
had a middlingsized swag in front just as if wed come a long way We
dressed pretty rough too we had longish hair and beards and except
Starlight might have been easy taken for downtheriver stockmen or
drovers

When we got to Barness place he and the old woman seemed ever so
glad to see us Bella and Maddie rushed out making a great row and
chattering both at a time

Why we thought you were lost or shot or something Bella says You
might have sent us a letter or a message only I suppose you didnt
think it worth while

What a bad state the countrys getting in says Maddie Think of
them bushrangers sticking up the bank at Ballabri and locking up
the constable in his own cell Ha ha The police magistrate was here
tonight You should have heard Bella talking so nice and proper to him
about it

Yes and you said theyd all be caught and hanged said Bella that
it was settin such a bad example to the young men of the colony My
word it was as good as a play Mad was so full of her fun and when
the PM said theyd be sure to be caught in the long run Maddie said
theyd have to import some thoroughbred police to catch em for our
Sydneyside ones didnt seem to have pace enough This made the old
gentleman stare and he looked at Maddie as if she was out of her mind
Didnt he Mad

I do think its disgraceful of Goring and his lot not to have run them
in before says Starlight but it wouldnt do for us to interfere

Ah but Sir Ferdinand Morringers come up now says Maddie Hell
begin to knock saucepans out of all the boys between here and Weddin
Mountain He was here too and asked us a lot of questions about people
who were wanted in these parts

He fell in love with Maddie too says Bella and gave her one of the
charms of his watch chainsuch a pretty one too Hes going to catch
Starlights mob as he calls them Maddie says shell send him word if
ever she knows of their being about

Well done Maddie says Jim so you may just an hour or two after
were started There wont be much likelihood of his overhauling us
then He wont be the first man thats been fooled by a woman will he

Or the last Jim says Bella What do you say Captain It seems to
me were doing all the talking and youre doing all the listening That
isnt fair you know We like to hear ourselves talk but fair play is
bonny play Suppose you tell us what youve been about all this time I
think teas ready

We had our innings in the talking line Jim and Maddie made noise enough
for halfadozen Starlight let himself be talked to and didnt say
much himself but I could see even he that had seen a lot of high
life in his time was pleased enough with the nonsense of a couple
of goodlooking girls like theseregular bushbred fillies as they
wereafter being shut up in the Hollow for a month or two

Before wed done a couple of travellers rode up Jonathans place was
getting a deal more custom nowit lay near about the straight line for
the Turon and came to be known as a pretty comfortable shop Jonathan
came in with them and gave us a wink as much as to say Its all
right

These gentlemens just come up from Sydney he said not long from
England and wants to see the diggings I told em you might be going
that way and could show em the road

Very happy says Starlight I am from Port Phillip last myself
and think of going back by Honolulu after Ive made the round of the
colonies My good friends and travelling companions are on their way for
the Darling We can all travel together

What a fortunate thing we came here Clifford eh says one young
fellow putting up his eyeglass You wanted to push on Now we shall
have company and not lose our way in this beastly bush as they call
it

Well it does look like luck says the other man I was beginning to
think the confounded place was getting farther off every day Can you
show us our rooms if you please I suppose we couldnt have a bath

Oh yes you can said Maddie theres the creek at the bottom of the
garden only theres snakes now and then at night Ill get you towels

In that case I think I shall prefer to wait till the morning says the
tall man It will be something to look forward to

We were afraid the strangers would have spoiled our fun for the evening
but they didnt we made out afterwards that the tall one was a lord
They were just like anybody else and when we got the piano to work
after tea they made themselves pleasant enough and Starlight sang a
song or twohe could sing and no mistake when he likedand then one
of them played a waltz and the girls danced together and Starlight had
some champagne in said it was his birthday and hed just thought of
it and they got quite friendly and jolly before we turned in

Next day we made a start promising the girls a nugget each for a ring
out of the first gold we got and they promised to write to us and tell
us if they heard any news They knew what to say and we shouldnt be
caught simple if they could help it Jim took care though to keep well
off the road and take all the short cuts he knew We werent quite safe
till we was in the thick of the mining crowd Thats the best place
for a man or woman either to hide that wants to drop out of sight and
never be seen again Many a time Ive known a man called Jack or Tom
among the diggers and never thought of as anything else working like
them drinking and taking his pleasure and dressing like them till he
made his pile or died or something and then it turned out he was
the Honourable Mr SoandSo Captain This or Major That perhaps the
Reverend Somebodythough that didnt happen often

We were all the more contented though when we heard the row of the
cradles and the clang and bang of the stampers in the quartzcrushing
batteries again and saw the big crowd moving up and down like a hill of
ants the same as when wed left Turon last As soon as we got into the
main street we parted Jim and I touched our hats and said goodbye to
Starlight and the other two who went away to the crack hotel We went
and made a camp down by the creek so that we might turn to and peg out
a claim or buy out a couple of shares first thing in the morning

Except the Hollow it was the safest place in the whole country just now
as we could hear that every week fresh people were pouring in from
all the other colonies and every part of the world The police on the
diggings had their own work pretty well cut out for them what with old
hands from Van Diemens Land Californiansand you may bet roughs and
rascals from every place under the sun Besides we wanted to see for
ourselves how the thing was done and pick up a few wrinkles that might
come in handy afterwards Our dodge was to take a few notes with us and
buy into a claimone here one therenot to keep together for fear of
consequences If we worked and kept steady at it in a place where
there were thousands of strangers of all kinds it would take the devil
himself to pick us out of such a queer bubbling noisy mixedup pot of
hellbroth

Things couldnt have dropped in more lucky for us than they did In this
way Starlight was asked by the two swells to join them because they
wanted to do a bit of digging just for the fun of it and he made out
hed just come from Melbourne and hadnt been six months longer in the
country than they had Of course he was sunburnt a bit He got that in
India he said My word they played just into his hand and he did
the newchum swell all to pieces and so that natural no one could have
picked him out from them He dressed like them talked like them and
never let slip a word except about shooting in England hunting in
America and India besides gammoning to be as green about all Australian
ways as if hed never seen a gum tree before They took up a claim and
bought a tent Then they got a wagesman to help them and all four used
to work like niggers The crowd christened them The Three Honourables
and used to have great fun watching them working away in their jerseys
and handling their picks and shovels like men Starlight used to drawl
just like the other two and asked questions about the colony and walk
about with them on Sundays and holidays in fashionable cut clothes Hed
brought money too and paid his share of the expenses and something
over It was a great sight to see at night and people said like nothing
else in the world just then Every one turned out for an hour or two
at night and then was the time to see the Turon in its glory Big
sunburnt men with beards and red silk sashes round their waists with
a sheathknife and revolvers mostly stuck in them and broadleaved
felt hats on There were Californians then foreigners of all
sortsFrenchmen Italians Germans Spaniards Greeks Negroes
Indians Chinamen They were a droll strange fiercelooking crowd
There werent many women at first but they came pretty thick after
a bit A couple of theatres were open a circus hotels with lots of
plateglass windows and splendid bars all lighted up and the front of
them anyhow as handsome at first sight as Sydney or Melbourne Drapers
and grocers ironmongers general stores butchers and bakers all kept
open until midnight and every place was lighted up as clear as day
It was like a fairystory place Jim said he was as pleased as a child
with the glitter and show and strangeness of it all Nobody was poor
everybody was well dressed and had money to spend from the children
upwards Liquor seemed running from morning to night as if there
were creeks of it all the same there was very little drunkenness and
quarrelling The police kept good order and the miners were their own
police mostly and didnt seem to want keeping right We always expected
the miners to be a disorderly rough set of peopleit was quite the
other way Only we had got into a world where everybody had everything
they wanted or else had the money to pay for it How different it
seemed from the hard grinding povertystricken life we had been
brought up to and all the settlers we knew when we were young People
had to work hard for every pound they made then and if they hadnt the
ready cash obliged to do without even if it was bread to eat Many
a time wed had no tea and sugar when we were little because father
hadnt the money to pay for it That was when he stayed at home and
worked for what he got Well it was honest money at any ratepity he
hadnt kept that way

Now all this was changed It wasnt like the same country Everybody
dressed well lived high and the money never ran short nor was likely
to as long as the gold kept spreading and was found in 10 20 50 pound
nuggets every week or two We had a good claim and began to think about
six months work would give us enough to clear right away with We let
our hair grow long and made friends with some Americans so we began
to talk a little like them just for fun and most people took us for
Yankees We didnt mind that Anything was better than being taken for
what we were And if we could get clear off to San Francisco there were
lots of grand new towns springing up near the Rocky Mountains where a
man could live his life out peaceably and never be heard of again

As for Starlight hed laid it out with his two noble friends to go back
to Sydney in two or three months and run down to Honolulu in one of the
trading vessels They could get over to the Pacific slope or else have
a year among the Islands and go anywhere they pleased They had got
that fond of Haughton as he called himselfFrank Haughtonthat
nothing would have persuaded them to part company And wasnt he a man
to be fond ofalways ready for anything always goodtempered except
when people wouldnt let him ready to work or fight or suffer hardship
if it came to that just as cheerful as he went to his dinnernever
thinking or talking much about himself but always there when he was
wanted You couldnt have made a more outandout all round man to live
and die with and yet wasnt it a murder that there should be that
against him when it came out that spoiled the whole lot We used to
meet now and then but never noticed one another except by a bit of
a nod or a wink in public One day Jim and I were busy puddling some
dirt and we saw Sergeant Goring ride by with another trooper He looked
at us but we were splashed with yellow mud and had handkerchiefs
tied over our heads I dont think mother would have known us He just
glanced over at us and took no notice If he didnt know us there was no
fear of any one else being that sharp to do it So we began to take it
easy and to lose our fear of being dropped on at any time Ours was a
middling good claim too two mens ground and we were lucky from the
start Jim took to the pick and shovel work from the first and was as
happy as a man could be

After our days work we used to take a stroll through the lighted
streets at night What a place it had grown to be and how different it
was from being by ourselves at the Hollow The gold was coming in that
fast that it paid people to build more shops and bring up goods from
Sydney every week until there wasnt any mortal thing you couldnt
get there for money Everything was dear of course but everybody
had money and nobody minded paying two prices when they were washing
perhaps two or three pounds weight of gold out of a tub of dirt

One night Jim and I were strolling about with some of our Yankee
friends when some one said thered been a new hotel opened by some
Melbourne people which was very swell and we might take a look at it
We didnt say no so we all went into the parlour and called for drinks
The landlady herself came in dressed up to the nines and made herself
agreeable as she might well do We were all pretty well in but one of
the Americans owned the Golden Gate claim and was supposed to be the
richest man on the field Hed known her before

Waal Mrs Mullockson says he so youve pulled up stakes from
Bendigo City and concluded to locate here How do you approbate Turon

She said something or other we hardly knew what Jim and I couldnt
help giving one look Her eyes turned on us We could see she knew us
though she hadnt done so at first We took no notice no more did she
but she followed us to the door and touched me on the shoulder

Youre not going to desert old friends Dick she said in a low voice
I wrote you a cross letter but we must forgive and forget you know
You and Jim come up tomorrow night wont you

All right Kate I said and we followed our party




Chapter 27



This meeting with Kate Morrison put the stuns upon me and Jim and
no mistake We never expected to see her up at the Turon and it all
depended which way the fit took her now whether it would be a fit place
for us to live in any longer Up to this time we had done capital well
We had been planted as close as if we had been at the Hollow Wed had
lots of work and company and luck It began to look as if our luck
would be dead out Anyhow we were at the mercy of a tigercat of a
woman who might let loose her temper at any time and lay the police
on to us without thinking twice about it We didnt think she knew
Starlight was there but she was knowing enough for anything She could
put two and two together and wait and watch too It gave me a fit of
the shivers every time I thought of it This was the last place I ever
expected to see her at However you never can tell whatll turn up in
this world She might have got over her tantrums

Of course we went over to the Prospectors Arms that night as the new
hotel was called and found quite a warm welcome Mrs Mullockson had
turned into quite a fashionable lady since the Melbourne days dressed
very grand and talked and chaffed with the commissioner the police
inspectors and goldfield officers from the camp as if shed been
brought up to it People lived fast in those goldfields days it dont
take long to pick up that sort of learning

The Prospectors Arms became quite the go and all the swell miners
and quartz reefers began to meet there as a matter of course There was
Dandy Green the Lincolnshire man from Beevor that used to wear no end
of boots and spend pounds and pounds in blacking He used to turn out
with everything clean on every morning fit to go to a ball as he
walked on to the brace There was Ballersdorf the old Prussian soldier
that had fought against Boney and owned halfadozen crushing machines
and a sixth share in the Great Wattle Flat Company Dan Robinson the
man that picked up the 70 pound nugget Sam Dawson of White Hills
and Peter Paul the Canadian with a lot of others all known men went
there regular Some of them didnt mind spending fifty or a hundred
pounds in a night if the fit took them The house began to do a
tremendous trade and no mistake

Old Mullockson was a quiet redfaced old chap who seemed to do all
Kate told him and never bothered himself about the business except
when he had to buy fresh supplies in the wine and spirit line There he
was first chop You couldnt lick him for quality And so the place got
a name

But where was Jeanie all this time That was what Jim put me up to ask
the first night we came Oh Jeanie poor girl she was stopping with
her aunt in Melbourne But Kate had written to her and she was coming
up in a few weeks This put Jim into great heart What with the regular
work and the doing well in the gold line and Jeanie coming up poor old
Jim looked that happy that he was a different man No wonder the police
didnt know him He had grown out of his old looks and ways and though
they rubbed shoulders with us every day no one had eyes sharp enough to
see that James Henderson and his brother Dickmates with the best
men on the fieldwere escaped prisoners and had a big reward on them
besides

Nobody knew it and that was pretty nigh as good as if it wasnt true
So we held on and made money hand over fist We used to go up to the
hotel whenever wed an evening to spare but that wasnt often We
intended to keep our money this time and no publican was to be any the
better for our hard work

As for Kate I couldnt make her out Most times shed be that pleasant
and jolly no one could help liking her She had a way of talking to me
and telling me everything that happened because I was an old friend she
saidthat pretty nigh knocked me over I tell you Other times she was
that savage and violent no one would go near her She didnt care who it
wasservants or customers they all gave her a wide berth when she
was in her tantrums As for old Mullockson he used to take a drive to
Sawpit Gully or TenMile as soon as ever he saw what oclock it wasand
glad to clear out too She never dropped on to me somehow Perhaps she
thought shed get as good as she gave I wasnt over good to lead and
couldnt be drove at the best of times No not by no woman that ever
stepped

One evening Starlight and his two swell friends comes in quite
accidental like They sat down at a small table by themselves and
ordered a couple of bottles of foreign wine There was plenty of that
if you liked to pay a guinea a bottle I remember when common brandy was
that price at first and Ive seen it fetched out of a doctors tent as
medicine It paid him better than his salts and rhubarb That was before
the hotels opened and while all the grog was sold on the sly They
marched in dressed up as if theyd been in George Street though
everybody knew one of em had been at the windlass all day with the
wages man and the other two below working up to their knees in water
for theyd come on a drift in their claim and were puddling back
However that says nothing we were all in good clothes and fancy
shirts and ties Miners dont go about in their working suits The two
Honourables walked over to the bar first of all and said a word or two
to Kate who was all smiles and as pleasant as you please It was one of
her good days Starlight put up his eyeglass and stared round as if we
were all a lot of queer animals out of a caravan Then he sat down and
took up the Turon Star Kate hardly looked at him she was so taken up
with his two friends and womanlike bent on drawing them on knowing
them to be big swells in their own country We never looked his way
except on the sly and no one could have thought wed ever slept under
one tree together or seen the things we had

When the waiter was opening their wine one of the camp officers comes in
that they had letters to So they asked him to join them and Starlight
sends for another bottle of Mosellesomething like that he called it

The last time I drank wine as good as this says Starlight was at
the Caffy Troy something or other in Paris I wouldnt mind being
there again with the Variety Theatre to follow Would you Clifford

Well I dont know says the other swell I find this amazing good
fun for a bit I never was in such grand condition since I left Oxford
This eighthours shift business is just the right thing for training I
feel fit to go for a mans life Just feel this Despard and he holds
out his arm to the camp swell Theres muscle for you

Plenty of muscle said Mr Despard looking round He was a swell that
didnt work and wouldnt work and thought it fine to treat the diggers
like dogs Most of the commissioners and magistrates were gentlemen and
acted as such but there were a few young fools like this one and they
did the Government a deal of harm with the diggers more than they knew
Plenty of muscle says he but devilish little society

I dont agree with you says the other Honourable Its the most
amusing and in a way instructive place for a man who wants to know his
fellowcreatures I was ever in I never pass a day without meeting some
fresh variety of the human race man or woman and their experiences
are well worth knowing I can tell you Not that theyre in a hurry to
impart them for that theres more natural unaffected good manners on
a digging than in any society I ever mingled in I shall never doubt
But when they see you dont want to patronise and are content to be
a simple man among men theres nothing they wont do for you or tell
you

Oh dn ones fellowcreatures present company excepted says
Mr Despard filling his glass and the man that grew this tipple
Theyre useful to me now and then and one has to put up with this crowd
but I never could take much interest in them

All the worse for you Despard says Clifford Youre wasting your
chancesgolden opportunities in every sense of the word Youll never
see such a spectacle as this perhaps again as long as you live Its a
fancy dress ball with real characters

Dashed bad characters if we only knew says Despard yawning What
do you say Haughton looking at Starlight who was playing with his
glass and not listening much by the look of him

I say lets go into the little parlour and have a game of picquet
unless youll take some more wine No Then well move Bad characters
you were saying Well you camp fellows ought to be able to give an
opinion

They sauntered through the big room which was just then crowded with a
curious company as Clifford said I suppose there was every kind of man
and miner under the sun Not many women but what there was not a little
out of the way in looks and manners We kept on working away all the
time It helped to stop us from thinking and every week we had a bigger
depositreceipt in the bank where we used to sell our gold People may
say what they like but theres nothing like a nest egg seeing it grow
bigger keeps many a fellow straight and he gets to like adding to it
and feels the pull of being careful with his money which a poor man
that never has anything worth saving doesnt Poor men are the most
extravagant Ive always found They spend all they have which middling
kind of people just above them dont They screw and pinch to bring
up their children and what not and dress shabby and go without a lot
which the working man never thinks of stinting himself in But theres
the parson here to do that kind of thing Im not the proper sort of
cove to preach Id better leave it to him So we didnt spend our money
foolish like most part of the diggers that had a bit of luck but we
had to do a fair thing We got through a lot of money every week I
expect Talking of foolish things I saw one man that had his horse shod
with gold regular pure gold shoes The blacksmith made emgood solid
ones and all regular He rode into the main street one holiday and no
end of people stopped him and lifted up his horses feet to see They
weighed 7 oz 4 dwt each Rainbow ought to have been shod that way
If ever a horse deserved it he did But Starlight didnt go in for that
kind of thing Now and then some of the old colonial hands when they
were regularly on the burst would empty a dozen of champagne into a
bucket or light their pipes with a tenpound note But these were not
everyday larks and were laughed at by the diggers themselves as much as
anybody

But of course some allowance had to be made for men not making much
above wages when they came suddenly on a biggish stone and sticking
the pick into it found it to be a gigantic nugget worth a small fortune
Most men would go a bit mad over a stroke of luck like that and they
did happen now and then There was the Boennair nugget dug at Louisa
Creek by an Irishman that weighed 364 oz 11 dwt It was sold in Sydney
for 1156 Pounds There was the King of Meroo nugget weighing 157 oz
and another one that only scaled 71 oz seemed hardly worth picking up
after the others only 250 Pounds worth or so But there was a bigger
one yet on the grass if wed only known and many a digger and shepherd
too had sat down on it and lit his pipe thinking it no better than
other lumps of blind white quartz that lay piled up all along the crown
of the ride

Mostly after wed done our days work and turned out clean and
comfortable after supper smoking our pipes we walked up the street for
an hour or two Jim and I used to laugh a bit in a queer way over the
change it was from our old bush life at Rocky Flat when we were boys
before we had any thoughts beyond doing our regular days work and
milking the cows and chopping wood enough to last mother all day The
little creek that sounded so clear in the still night when we woke up
rippling and gurgling over the stones the silent dark forest all
round on every side and on moonlight nights the moon shining over Nulla
Mountain dark and overhanging all the valley as if it had been sailing
in the clear sky over it ever since the beginning of the world We
didnt smoke then and we used to sit in the verandah and Aileen would
talk to us till it was time to go to bed

Even when we went into Bargo or some of the other country towns they
did not seem so much brighter Sleepylooking steadygoing places they
all were with people crawling about them like a lot of old working
bullocks Just about as sensible many of em What a change all this
was Main Street at the Turon Just as bright as day at twelve oclock
at night Crowds walking up and down bars lighted up theatres going
on dancehouses in full swing billiardtables where you could hear the
balls clicking away till daylight miners walking down to their night
shifts others turning out after sleeping all the afternoon quite fresh
and lively halfadozen troopers clanking down the street back
from escort duty Everybody just as fresh at midnight as at breakfast
timemore so perhaps It was a new world

One things certain Jim and I would never have had the chance of seeing
as many different kinds of people in a hundred years if it hadnt been
for the gold No wonder some of the young fellows kicked over the traces
for a changea change from sheep cattle and horses ploughing and
reaping shearing and bullockdriving the same old thing every day
the same chaps to talk to about the same things It does seem a
deadandlive kind of life after all weve seen and done since However
wed a deal better have kept to the bulldogs motter Hang on and
stick to it even if it was a shade slow and stupid Wed have come out
right in the end as all coves do that hold fast to the right thing and
stick to the straight course fair weather or foul I can see that now
and many things else

But to see the big room at the Prospectors Arms at nightthe hall
they called itwas a sight worth talking aboutas Jim and I walked up
and down or sat at one of the small tables smoking our pipes with good
liquor before us It was like a fairytale come true to chaps like us
though we had seen a little life in Sydney and Melbourne

What made it so different from any other place wed ever seen or thought
of before was the strange mixture of every kind and sort of man and
woman to hear them all jabbering away together in different languages
or trying to speak English used to knock us altogether The American
diggers that we took up with had met a lot of foreigners in California
and other places They could speak a little Spanish and French and got
on with them But Jim and I could only stare and stand openmouthed
when a SpanishAmerican chap would come up with his red sash and his big
sheathknife while theyd yabber away quite comfortable

It made us feel like children and we began to think what a fine thing
it would be to clear out by Honolulu and so on to San Francisco as
Starlight was always talking about It would make men of us at any
rate and give us something to think about in the days to come

If we could clear out what a heaven it would be I could send over for
Gracey to come to me I knew shed do that if I was only once across
the sea ready and willing to lead a new life and with something
honestearned and hardworkedfor to buy a farm with Nobody need know
Nobody would even inquire in the far West where wed come from or what
wed done We should live close handy to one anotherJim and Jeanie
Gracey and Iand when dad went under mother and Aileen could come out
to us and there would still be a little happiness left us for all that
was come and gone Ah if things would only work out that way

Well more unlikely things happen every day And still the big room
gets fuller Theres a band strikes up in the next room and the dancing
begins This is a ball night Kate has started that game Shes a great
hand at dancing herself and she manages to get a few girls to come up
wherever they come from nobody knows for theres none to be seen in the
daytime But they turn out wonderfully welldressed and some of them
mighty goodlooking and the young swells from the camp come down and
the diggers that have been lucky and begin to fancy themselves And
theres no end of fun and flirting and nonsense such as there always is
when men and women get together in a place where theyre not obliged to
be overparticular Not that there was any rowdiness or bad behaviour
allowed A goldfield is the wrong shop for that Any one that didnt
behave himself would have pretty soon found himself on his head in the
street and lucky if he came out of it with whole bones

I once tried to count the different breeds and languages of the men in
the big room one night I stopped at thirty There were Germans
Swedes Danes Norwegians Russians Italians Greeks Jews Spaniards
Frenchmen Maltese Mexicans Negroes Indians Chinamen New
Zealanders English Irish Scotch Welsh Australians Americans
Canadians Creoles gentle and simple farmers and labourers squatters
and shepherds lawyers and doctors They were all alike for a bit
all pretty rich none poor or likely to be all workers and comrades
nobody wearing much better clothes or trying to make out he was higher
than anybody else Everybody was free with his money If a fellow was
sick or out of luck or his family was down with fever the notes came
freelyas many as were wanted and more when that was done There was
no room for small faults and vices everything and everybody was worked
on a high scale It was a grand timebetter than ever was in our
country before or since Jim and I always said we felt better men while
the flash time lasted and hadnt a thought of harm or evil about us
We worked hard enough too as I said before but we had good call to do
so Every week when we washed up we found ourselves a lot forrarder and
could see that if it held on like this for a few months more we should
have made our pile as the diggers called it and be able to get clear
off without much bother

Because it wasnt now as it was in the old times when Government could
afford to keep watch upon every vessel big and little that left the
harbour Now there was no end of trouble in getting sailors to man the
ships and we could have worked our passage easy enough theyd have
taken us and welcome though wed never handled a rope in our lives
before Besides that there were hundreds of strangers starting for
Europe and America by every vessel that left Men who had come out to
the colony expecting to pick up gold in the streets and had gone home
disgusted lucky men too like ourselves who had sworn to start for
home the very moment they had made a fair thing How were any police in
the world to keep the run of a few men that had been in trouble before
among such a mixedup mob

Now and then we managed to get a talk with Starlight on the sly He used
to meet us at a safe place by night and talk it all over He and his
mates were doing well and expected to be ready for a start in a few
months when we might meet in Melbourne and clear out together He
believed it would be easy and said that our greatest danger of being
recognised was now overthat we had altered so much by living and
working among the diggers that we could pass for diggers anywhere

Why we were all dining at the Commissioners yesterday he said
when who should walk in but our old friend Goring Hes been made
inspector now and of course hes a great swell and a general
favourite The Commissioner knew his family at home and makes no end of
fuss about him He left for the Southern district I am glad to say
I felt queer I must say but of course I didnt show it We
were formally introduced He caught me with that sudden glance of
hisdevilish sharp eyes he hasand looks me full in the face

I dont remember your name Mr Haughton said he but your face
seems familiar to me somehow I cant think where Ive met you before

Must have been at the Melbourne Club says I pulling my moustache
Met a heap of Sydney people there

Perhaps so says he I used to go and lunch there a good deal I had
a months leave last month just after I got my step Curious it seems
too says he I cant get over it

Fill your glass and pass the claret says the Commissioner Faces
are very puzzling things met in a different state of existence I dont
suppose Haughtons wanted eh Goring

This was held to be a capital joke and I laughed too in a way that
would have made my fortune on the stage Goring laughed too and seemed
to fear hed wounded my feelings for he was most polite all the rest of
the evening

Well if HE didnt smoke you says Jim were right till the Day of
Judgment Theres no one else here thats half a ghost of a chance to
swear to us

Except says I

Oh Kate says Jim never mind her Jeanies coming up to be married
to me next month and Kates getting so fond of you again that theres
no fear of her letting the cat out

Thats the very reason I never cared two straws about her and now
I hate the sight of her Shes a revengeful devil and if she takes it
into her head shell turn on us some fine day as sure as were alive

Dont you believe it says Jim women are not so bad as all that
Are they not says Starlight Ill go bail well be snug and
safe here till Christmas and then well give out say were going to
Melbourne for a spree and clear straight out




Chapter 28



As everything looked so fairweatherlike Jim and Jeanie made it up to
be married as soon after she came up as he could get a house ready She
came up to Sydney first by sea and after that to the diggings by the
coach She was always a quiet hardworking good little soul awful
timid and prudent in everything but in taking a fancy to Jim But
thats neither here nor there Women will take fancies as long as the
world lasts and if they happen to fancy the wrong people the more
obstinate they hold on to em Jeanie was one of the prettiest girls
I ever set eyes on in her way very fair and clear coloured with big
soft blue eyes and hair like a cloud of spun silk Nothing like her was
ever seen on the field when she came up so all the diggers said

When they began to write to one another after we came to the Turon Jim
told her straight out that though we were doing well now it mightnt
last He thought she was a great fool to leave Melbourne when she was
safe and comfortable and come to a wild place in a way like the Turon
Of course he was ready and willing to marry her but speaking all for
her own good he advised her not Shed better give him up and set
her mind on somebody else Girls that was anyway goodlooking and kept
themselves proper and decent were very scarce in Melbourne and Sydney
now considering the number of men that were making fortunes and were
anxious to get a wife and settle down A girl like her could marry
anybodymost likely some one above her own rank in life Of course
she wouldnt have no one but Jim and if he was ready to marry her and
could get a little cottage she was ready too She would always be his
own Jeanie and was willing to run any kind of risk so as to be with him
and near him and so on

Starlight and I both tried to keep Jim from it all we knew It would
make things twice as bad for him if he had to turn out again and there
was no knowing the moment when we might have to make a bolt for it and
where could Jeanie go then

But Jim had got one of his obstinate fits He said we were regularly
mixed up with the diggers now He never intended to follow any other
life and wouldnt go back to the Hollow or take part in any fresh cross
work no matter how good it might be Poor old Jim I really believe
hed made up his mind to go straight from the very hour he was buckled
to Jeanie and if hed only had common luck hed have been as square and
right as George Storefield to this very hour

I was near forgetting about old George My word he was getting on
faster than we were though he hadnt a golden hole He was goldfinding
in a different way and no mistake One day we saw a stoutish man drive
up Main Street to the camp with a wellgroomed horse in a dogcart and
a servant with him and who was this but old George He didnt twig us
He drove close alongside of Jim who was coming back from the creek
where hed been puddling with two shovels and a pick over his shoulder
and a pair of old yellow trousers on and him splashed up to the eyes
George didnt know him a bit But we knew him and laughed to ourselves
to see the big swell he had grown into He stopped at the camp and left
his dogcart outside with his man Next thing we saw was the Commissioner
walking about outside the camp with him and talking to him just as if
he was a regular intimate friend

The Commissioner that was so proud that he wouldnt look at a digger or
shake hands with him not if he was a young marquis as long as he was
a digger No he used to say I have to keep my authority over these
thousands and tens of thousands of people some of them very wild and
lawless principally by moral influence though of course I have the
Government to fall back upon To do that I must keep up my position
and overfamiliarity would be the destruction of it When we saw him
shaking hands with old George and inviting him to lunch we asked one
of the miners next to our claim if he knew what that mans name and
occupation was there

Oh he says I thought everybody knew him Thats Storefield the
great contractor He has all the contracts for horsefeed for the camps
and police stations nearly every one between here and Kiandra Hes
took em lucky this year and hes making money hand over fist

Well done steady old George No wonder he could afford to drive a good
horse and a swell dogcart He was getting up in the world We were a bit
more astonished when we heard the Commissioner say

I am just about to open court Mr Storefield Would you mind taking a
few cases with me this morning

We went into the courthouse just for a lark There was old George
sitting on the bench as grave as a judge and a rattling good magistrate
he made too He disagreed from the Commissioner once or twice and
showed him where he was right too not in the law but in the facts of
the case where Georges knowing working men and their ways gave him
the pull He wasnt over sharp and hard either like some men directly
theyre raised up a bit just to show their power But just seemed to do
a fair thing neither too much one way or the other George stayed
and had lunch at the camp with the Commissioner when the court
was adjourned and he drove away afterwards with his upstanding
eightyguinea horsehorses was horses in those daysjust as good
a gentleman to look at as anybody Of course we knew there was a
difference and hed never get over a few things hed missed when he was
young in the way of education But he was liked and respected for all
that and made welcome everywhere He was a man as didnt push himself
one bit There didnt seem anything but his money and his goodnatured
honest face and now and then a bit of a clumsy joke to make him a
place But when the swells make up their minds to take a man in among
themselves theyre not half as particular as commoner people they do a
thing well when theyre about it

So George was hailfellowwellmet with all the swells at the camp
and the bankers and big storekeepers and the doctors and lawyers and
clergymen all the nobs there were at the Turon and when the Governor
himself and his lady came up on a visit to see what the place was like
why George was taken up and introduced as if hed been a regular blessed
curiosity in the way of contractors and his Excellency hadnt set eyes
on one before

My word Dick Jim says its a murder he and Aileen didnt cotton
to one another in the old days Shed have been just the girl to have
fancied all this sort of swell racket with a silk gown and dressed up a
bit There isnt a woman here thats a patch on her for looks is there
now except Jeanie and shes different in her ways

I didnt believe there was I began to think it over in my own mind and
wonder how it came about that shed missed all her chances of rising
in life and if ever a woman was born for it she was I couldnt help
seeing whose fault it was that shed been kept back and was now obliged
to work hard and almost ashamed to show herself at Bargo and the other
small towns not that the people were ever shy of speaking to her but
she thought they might be and wouldnt give them a chance In about a
month up comes Jeanie Morrison from Melbourne looking just the same as
the very first evening we met Kate and her on the St Kilda beach Just
as quiet and shy and modestlookingonly a bit sadder and not quite so
ready to smile as shed been in the old days She looked as if shed had
a grief to hide and fight down since then A girls first sorrow
when something happened to her love They never look quite the same
afterwards Ive seen a good many and if it was real right down love
they were never the same in looks or feelings afterwards They might
get over it as people call it but thats a sort of healing over a
wound It dont always cure it and the wound often breaks out again and
bleeds afresh

Jeanie didnt look so bad and she was that glad to see Jim again and
to find him respected as a hardworking welltodo miner that she forgot
most of her disappointments and forgave him his share of any deceit that
had been practised upon her and her sister Women are like that Theyll
always make excuses for men theyre fond of and blame anybody else that
can be blamed or thats within reach She thought Starlight and me had
the most to do with itperhaps we had but Jim could have cut loose
from us any time before the Momberah cattle racket much easier than he
could now I heard her say once that she thought other people were much
more to blame than poor Jamespeople who ought to have known better
and so on By the time she had got to the end of her little explanation
Jim was completely whitewashed of course It had always happened to him
and I suppose always would He was a man born to be helped and looked
out for by every one he came near

Seeing how goodlooking Jeanie was thought and how all the swells
kept crowding round to get a look at her if she was near the bar Kate
wanted to have a ball and show her off a bit But she wouldnt have it
She right down refused and close upon quarrelled with Kate about it She
didnt take to the glare and noise and excitement of Turon at all She
was frightened at the strangelooking men that filled the streets by day
and the hall at the Prospectors by night The women she couldnt abide
Anyhow she wouldnt have nothing to say to them All she wantedand she
kept at Jim day after day till she made him carry it outwas for him to
build or buy a cottage she didnt care how small where they could
go and live quietly together She would cook his meals and mend his
clothes and they would come into town on Saturday nights only and be
as happy as kings and queens She didnt come up to dance or flirt she
said in a place like Turon and if Jim didnt get a home for her shed
go back to her dressmaking at St Kilda This woke up Jim so he bought
out a miner who lived a bit out of the town He had made money and
wanted to sell his improvements and clear out for Sydney It was a small
fourroomed weatherboard cottage with a bark roof but very neatly put
on There was a little creek in front and a small flower garden with
rose trees growing up the verandah posts Most miners when theyre
doing well make a garden They take a pride in having a neat cottage
and everything about it shipshape The ground of course didnt belong
to him but he held it by his miners right The title was good enough
and he had a right to sell his goodwill and improvements

Jim gave him his price and took everything even to the bits of
furniture They werent much but a place looks awful bare without them
The dog and the cock and hens he bought too He got some real nice
things in Turontables chairs sofas beds and so on and had the
place lined and papered inside quite swell Then he told Jeanie the
house was ready and the next week they were married They were married
in the churchthat is the iron building that did duty for one It had
all been carted up from Melbourneframework roof seats and alland
put together at Turon It didnt look so bad after it was painted
though it was awful hot in summer

Here they were married all square and regular by the Scotch clergyman
He was the first minister of any kind that came up to the diggings and
the men had all come to like him for his straightforward earnest way
of preaching Not that we went often but a good few of us diggers went
every now and then just to show our respect for him and so Jim
said hed be married by Mr Mackenzie and no one else Jeanie was a
Presbyterian so it suited her all to pieces

Well the church was chockfull There never was such a congregation
before Lots of people had come to know Jim on the diggings and more
had heard of him as a straightgoing goodlooking digger who was free
with his money and pretty lucky As for Jeanie there was a report that
she was the prettiest girl in Melbourne and something of that sort and
so they all tried to get a look at her Certainly though there had been
a good many marriages since we had come to the Turon the church had
never held a handsomer couple Jeanie was quietly dressed in plain white
silk She had on a veil no ornaments of any kind or sorts It was a
warmish day and there was a sort of peachblossom colour on her cheeks
that looked as delicate as if a breath of air would blow it away When
she came in and saw the crowd of bronze bearded faces and hundreds of
strange eyes bent on her she turned quite pale Then the flush came
back on her face and her eyes looked as bright as some of the sapphires
we used to pick up now and then out of the river bed Her hair was
twisted up in a knot behind but even that didnt hide the lovely colour
nor what a lot there was of it As she came in with her slight figure
and modest sweet face that turned up to Jims like a childs there
was a sort of hum in the church that sounded very like breaking into a
cheer

Jim certainly was a big upstanding chap strong built but active with
it and as fine a figure of a man as youd see on the Turon or any other
place He stood about six feet and an inch and was as straight as a
rush There was no stiffness about him either He was broadshouldered
and light flanked quick on his pins and as good a manall roundwith
his hands as you could pick out of the regular prize ring He was as
strong as a bullock and just as good at the end of a day as at the
start With the work wed had for the last five or six months we were
all in top condition as hard as a board and fit to work at any pace for
twentyfour hours on end He had an open merry laughing face had Jim
with straight features and darkish hair and eyes Nobody could ever keep
angry with Jim He was one of those kind of men that could fight to some
purpose now and then but that most people found it very hard to keep
bad friends with

Besides the miners there were lots of other people in church who had
heard of the wedding and come to see us I saw Starlight and the two
Honourables dressed up as usual besides the Commissioner and the camp
officers and more than that the new Inspector of Police whod only
arrived the day before Sir Ferdinand Morringer even he was there
dividing the peoples attention with the bride Besides that who should
I see but Bella and Maddie Barnes and old Jonathan Theyd ridden into
the Turon for theyd got their riding habits on and Bella had the
watch and chain Starlight had given her I saw her look over to where
he and the other two were but she didnt know him again a bit in the
world He was sitting there looking as if he was bored and tired with
the whole thinghadnt seen a soul in the church before and didnt
want to see em again

I saw Maddie Barnes looking with all her eyes at Jim while her face
grew paler She hadnt much colour at the best of times but she was a
finegrown lissom goodlooking girl for all that and as full of fun
and games as she could stick Her eyes seemed to get bigger and darker
as she looked and when the parson began to read the service she turned
away her head I always thought she was rather soft on Jim and now I
saw it plain enough He was one of those rattling jolly kind of fellows
that cant help being friendly with every girl he meets and very seldom
cares much for any one in particular He had been backward and forward
a good deal with father before we got clear of Berrima and thats how
poor Maddie had come to take the fancy so strong and set her heart upon
him

It must be hard lines for a woman to stand by in a church or anywhere
else and see the man she loves given away for good and all buckled
hard and fast to another woman Nobody took much notice of poor Maddie
but I watched her pretty close and saw the tears come into her
eyes though she let em run down her face before shed pull out her
handkerchief Then she put up her veil and held up her head with a
bit of a toss and I saw her pride had helped her to bear it I dont
suppose anybody else saw her and if they did theyd only think she
was cryin for companyas women often do at weddings and all kinds of
things But I knew better She wouldnt peach poor thing Still I saw
that more than one or two knew who we were and all about us that day

Wed only just heard that the new Inspector of Police had come on to the
field so of course everybody began to talk about him and wanted to have
a look at him Next to the Commissioner and the PM the Inspector of
Police is the biggest man in a country town or on a goldfield He has a
tremendous lot of power and inside of the law can do pretty much what
he pleases He can arrest a man on suspicion and keep him in gaol for
a month or two He can have him remanded from time to time for further
evidence and make it pretty hot for him generally He can let him out
when he proves innocent and nobody can do anything All he has to say
is There was a mistake in the mans identity or Not sufficient
proof Anything of that sort He can walk up to any man he likes or
dislikes and tell him to hold up his hands for the handcuffs and shoot
him if he resists He has servants to wait on him and orderly troopers
to ride behind him a handsome uniform like a cavalry officer and if
hes a smart soldierly goodlooking fellow as he very often is
hes run after a good deal and can hold his head as high as he pleases
Theres a bit of risk sometimes in apprehending desperateahembad
characters and with bushrangers and people of that sort but nothing
more than any young fellow of spirit would like mixed up with his work
Very often theyre men of good family in the old country that have found
nothing to do in this and have taken to the police When it was known
that this Ferdinand Morringer was a real baronet and had been an officer
in the Guards you may guess how the flood of goldfields talk rose
and flowed and foamed all round him It was Sir Ferdinand this and Sir
Ferdinand that wherever you went He was going to lodge at the Royal
No of course he was going to stay at the camp He was married and had
three children Not a bit of it he was a bachelor and he was going to
be married to Miss Ingersoll the daughter of the bank manager of the
Bank of New Holland Theyd met abroad He was a tall finelooking
man Not at all only middlesized hadnt old Major Trenck the
superintendent of police when he came to enlist and said he had been in
the Guards growled out Too short for the Guards

But I was not a private replied Sir Ferdinand

Well anyhow theres a something about him Nobody can deny he looks
like a gentleman my word hell put some of these Weddin Mountain chaps
thro their facins youll see says one miner

Not he says another not if he was ten baronites in one all the
same hes a manlylooking chap and shows blood

This was the sort of talk we used to hear all round usfrom the miners
from the storekeepers from the mixed mob at the Prospectors Arms in
the big room at night and generally all about We said nothing and
took care to keep quiet and do and say nothing to be took hold of All
the same we were glad to see Sir Ferdinand Wed heard of him before
from Goring and the other troopers but hed been on duty in another
district and hadnt come in our way

One evening we were all sitting smoking and yarning in the big room of
the hotel and Jim for a wonderwed been washing upwhen we saw one
of the camp gentlemen come in and a strange officer of police with
him A sort of whisper ran through the room and everybody made up their
minds it was Sir Ferdinand Jim and I both looked at him

Waal said one of our Yankee friends what yur twistin your necks
at like a flock of geese in a corn patch How dye fix it that a lords
bettern any other man

Hes a bit different somehow I says Were not goin to kneel down
or knuckle under to him but he dont look like any one else in this
room does he

Hes no slouch and he looks yer square and full in the eye like a
hunter says Arizona Bill but durn my old buckskins if I can see
why you Britishers sets up idols and such and worship em in a colony
jests if yer was in that benighted old England again

We didnt say any more Jim lit his pipe and smoked away thinking
perhaps more whether Sir Ferdinand was anything of a revolver shot and
if he was likely to hit him Jim at forty or fifty yards in case such
a chance should turn up than about the difference of rank and such
things

While we were talking we saw Starlight and one of the Honourables come
in and sit down close by Sir Ferdinand who was taking his grog at a
small table and smoking a big cigar The Honourable and he jumps up at
once and shook hands in such a hurry so as we knew theyd met before
Then the Honourable introduces Starlight to Sir Ferdinand We felt too
queer to laugh Jim and I else we should have dropped off our seats
when Starlight bowed as grave as a judge and Sir Ferdinand we could
hear asked him how many months hed been out in the colony and how he
liked it

Starlight said it wasnt at all a bad place when you got used to it but
he thought he should try and get away before the end of the year

We couldnt help sniggerin a bit at this specially when Arizona Bill
said Thars another durned fool of a Britisher look at his eyeglass
I wonder the field has not shaken some of that cussed foolishness out of
him by this time




Chapter 29



Jim and his wife moved over to the cottage in Specimen Gully the miners
went back to their work and there was no more talk or bother about the
matter Something always happened every day at the Turon which wiped the
last thing clean out of peoples mind Either it was a big nugget or
a new reef or a tent robbery a goldbuyer stuck up and robbed in the
Ironbarks a horsestealing match a fight at a dancehouse or a big
law case Accidents and offences happened every day and any of them was
enough to take up the whole attention of every digger on the field till
something else turned up

Not that we troubled our heads over much about things of this sort We
had set our minds to go on until our claims were worked out or close
up then to sell out and with the lot wed already banked to get down
to Melbourne and clear out Should we ever be able to manage that It
seemed getting nearer nearer like a star that a man fixes his eyes on
as he rides through a lonely bit of forest at night We had all got our
eyes fixed on it Lord knows and were working double tides doing our
very best to make up a pile worth while leaving the country with As
for Jim he and his little wife seemed that happy that he grudged
every minute he spent away from her He worked as well as everbetter
indeed for he never took his mind from his piece of work whatever it
was for a second But the very minute his shift was over Jim was away
along the road to Specimen Gully like a cow going back to find her
calf He hardly stopped to light his pipe now and wed only seen him
once up town and that was on a Saturday night with Jeanie on his arm

Well the weeks passed over and at long last we got on as far in the
year as the first week in December Wed given out that we might go
somewhere to spend our Christmas We were known to be pretty well in
and to have worked steady all these months since the early part of the
year We had paid our way all the time and could leave at a minutes
notice without asking any mans leave

If we were digging up gold like potatoes we werent the only ones No
not by a lot There never was a richer patch of alluvial I believe in
any of the fields and the quantity that was sent down in one year was
a caution Wasnt the cash scattered about then Talk of money it was
like the dirt under your feetin one way certainlyas the dirt was
more often than not full of gold

We could see things getting worse on the field after a bit We didnt
set up to be any great shakes ourselves Jim and I but we didnt want
the field to be overrun by a set of scoundrels that were the very scum
of the earth let alone the other colonies We were afraid theyd go in
for some big foolish row and we should get dragged in for it That was
exactly what we didnt want

With the overflowing of the gold as it were came such a town and such
a people to fill it as no part of Australia had ever seen before When
it got known by newspapers and letters from the miners themselves to
their friends at home what an enormous yield of gold was being dug
out of the ground in such a simple fashion all the world seemed to
be moving over At that time nobody could tell a lie hardly about the
tremendous quantity that was being got and sent away every week This
was easy to know because the escort returns were printed in all the
newspapers every week so everybody could see for themselves what pounds
and hundredweights and tonsyes tons of goldwere being got by men
who very often as like as not hadnt to dig above twenty or thirty
feet for it and had never handled a pick or a shovel in their lives
before they came to the Turon

There were plenty of good men at the diggings I will say this for the
regular miners that a more manly straightgoing lot of fellows no man
ever lived among I wish wed never known any worse We were not what
might be called highly respectable people ourselvesstill men like us
are only halfandhalf bad like a good many more in this world
Theyre partly tempted into doing wrong by opportunity and kept back
by circumstances from getting into the straight track afterwards But on
every goldfield theres scores and scores of men that always hurry off
there like crows and eagles to a carcass to see what they can rend and
tear and fatten upon They aint very particular whether its the living
or the dead so as they can gorge their fill There was a good many of
this lot at the Turon and though the diggers gave them a wide berth
and helped to run them down when theyd committed any crime they
couldnt be kept out of sight and society altogether

We used to go up sometimes to see the gold escort start It was one of
the regular sights of the field and the miners that were off shift and
people that hadnt much to do generally turned up on escort day
The gold was taken down to Sydney once a week in a strong express
waggonsomething like a Yankee coach with leather springs and a high
driving seat so that four horses could be harnessed One of the police
sergeants generally drove a trooper fully armed with rifle and revolver
on the box beside him In the back seat sat two more troopers with their
Sniders ready for action two rode a hundred yards ahead and another
couple about the same distance behind

We always noticed that a good many of the sort of men that never seemed
to do any digging and yet always had good clothes and money to spend
used to hang about when the escort was starting People in the crowd
most always knew whether it was a big escort or a light one It
generally leaked out how many ounces had been sent by this bank and how
much by that how much had come from the camp for the diggers who did
not choose to sell to the banks were allowed to deposit their gold with
an officer at the camp where it was carefully weighed and a receipt
given to them stating the number of ounces pennyweights and grains
Then it was forwarded by the escort deducting a small percentage for
the carriage and safe keeping Government did not take all the risk upon
itself The miner must run his chance if he did not sell But the chance
was thought good enough the other thing was hardly worth talking about
Who was to be game to stick up the Government escort with eight police
troopers all well armed and ready to make a fight to the death before
they gave up the treasure committed to their charge The police
couldnt catch all the horsestealers and bushrangers in a country that
contained so many millions of acres of waste land but no one doubted
that they would make a firstrate fight on their own ground as it were
and before theyd let anything be taken away from them that had been
counted out box by box and given into their charge

We had as little notion of trying anything of the sort ourselves than as
we had of breaking into the Treasury in Sydney by night But those who
knew used to say that if the miners had known the past history of some
of the men that used to stand up and look on well dressed or in regular
digger rig as the gold boxes were being brought out and counted
into the escort drag they would have made a bodyguard to go with it
themselves when they had gold on board or have worried the Government
into sending twenty troopers in charge instead of six or eight

One day as Jim and I happened to be at the camp just as the escort was
starting the only time wed been there for a month we saw Warrigal and
Moran standing about They didnt see us we were among a lot of other
diggers so we were able to take them out of winding a bit

They were there for no good we agreed Warrigals sharp eyes noted
everything about the whole turnoutthe sergeants face that drove the
way the gold boxes were counted out and put in a kind of fixed locker
underneath the middle of the coach He saw where the troopers sat before
and behind and Ill be bound came away with a wonderful good general
idea of how the escort travelled and of a good many things more about
it that nobody guessed at As for Moran we could see him fix his eyes
upon the sergeant who was driving and look at him as if he could look
right through him He never took his eyes off him the whole time but
glared at him like a maniac if some of his people hadnt given him a
shove as they passed he would soon have attracted peoples attention
But the crowd was too busy looking at the wellconditioned prancing
horses and the neatly got up troopers of the escort drag to waste their
thoughts upon a common bushman however he might stare When he turned
away to leave he ground out a redhot curse betwixt his teeth It made
us think that Warrigals coming about with him on this line counted for
no good

They slipped through the crowd again and though they were pretty
close they never saw us Warrigal would have known us however we might
have been altered but somehow he never turned his head our way He
was like a child so taken up with all the things he saw that his
greatgrandfather might have jumped up from the Fish River Caves or
wherever he takes his rest and Warrigal would never have wondered at
him

Thats a queer start says Jim as we walked on our homeward path
I wonder what those two crawling dingolooking beggars were here for
Never no good I say did you see that fellow Moran look at the sergeant
as if hed eat him What eyes he has for all the world like a black
snake Do you think hes got any particular down on him

Not more than on all police I suppose hed rub them out every
mothers son if he could He and Warrigal cant stick up the escort by
themselves

We managed to get a letter from home from time to time now wed settled
as it were at the Turon Of course they had to be sent in the name of
Henderson but we called for them at the postoffice and got them all
right It was a treat to read Aileens letters now They were so jolly
and hopefullike besides what they used to be Now that wed been so
long it seemed years at the diggings and were working hard doing
well and getting quite settled as she said she believed that all
would go right and that we should be able really to carry out our plans
of getting clear away to some country where we could live safe and quiet
lives Women are mostly like that They first of all believe all that
theyre afraid of will happen Then as soon as they see things brighten
up a bit theyre as sure as fate everythings bound to go right They
dont seem to have any kind of feeling between They hate making up
their minds most of em as Ive known and jump from being ready to
drown themselves one moment to being likely to go mad with joy another
Anyhow you take em theyre better than men though Ill never go back
on that

So Aileen used to send me and Jim long letters now telling us that
things were better at home and that she really thought mother was
cheerfuller and stronger in health than shed been ever sincewell
ever sincethat had happened She thought her prayers had been heard
and that we were going to be forgiven for our sins and allowed by
Gods mercy to lead a new life She quite believed in our leaving the
country although her heart would be nearly broken by the thought that
she might never see us again and a lot more of the same sort

Poor mother she had a hard time of it if ever any one ever had in this
world and none of it her own fault as I could ever see Some people
gets punished in this world for the sins other people commit I can
see that fast enough Whether they get it made up to em afterwards of
course I cant say They ought to anyhow if it can be made up to em
Some things that are suffered in this world cant be paid for I dont
care how they fix it

More than once too there was a line or two on a scrap of paper slipped
in Aileens letters from Gracey Storefield She wasnt half as good with
the pen as Aileen but a few words from the woman you love goes a long
way no matter what sort of a fist she writes Gracey made shift to tell
me she was so proud to hear I was doing well that Aileens eyes had
been twice as bright lately that mother looked better than shed seen
her this years and if I could get away to any other country shed
meet me in Melbourne and would be as shed always been your own
Graceythats the way it was signed

When I read this I felt a different man I stood up and took an
oathsolemn mind you and I intended to keep itthat if I got clear
away Id pay her for her love and true heart with my life what was left
of it and Id never do another crooked thing as long as I lived Then I
began to count the days to Christmas

I wasnt married like Jim and it not being very lively in the tent at
night Arizona Bill and I mostly used to stroll up to the Prospectors
Arms Wed got used to sitting at the little table drinking our beer or
what not smoking our pipes and listening to all the fun that was going
on Not that we always sat in the big hall There was a snug little
parlour beside the bar that we found more comfortable and Kate used to
run in herself when business was slack enough to leave the barmaid then
shed sit down and have a good solid yarn with us

She made a regular old friend of me and as she was a handsome woman
always well dressed with lots to say and plenty of admirers I wasnt
above being singled out and made much of It was partly policy of
course She knew our secret and it wouldnt have done to have let her
let it out or be bad friends so that we should be always going in
dread of it So Jim and I were always mighty civil to her and I really
thought shed improved a lot lately and turned out a much nicer woman
than I thought she could be

We used to talk away about old times regular confidential and though
shed great spirits generally she used to change quite sudden sometimes
and say she was a miserable woman and wished she hadnt been in such
a hurry and married as she had Then shed crack up Jeanie and say
how true and constant shed been and how she was rewarded for it by
marrying the only man she ever loved She used to blame her temper
shed always had it she said and couldnt get rid of it but she
really believed if things had turned out different shed have been a
different woman and any man she really loved would never have had no
call to complain Of course I knew what all this meant but thought I
could steer clear of coming to grief over it

That was where I made the mistake But I didnt think so then or how
much hung upon careless words and looks

Well somehow or other she wormed it out of me that we were off
somewhere at Christmas Then she never rested till shed found out that
we were going to Melbourne After that she seemed as if shed changed
right away into somebody else She was that fair and softspeaking and
humbleminded that Jeanie couldnt have been more gentle in her ways
and she used to look at me from time to time as if her heart was
breaking I didnt believe that for I didnt think shed any heart to
break

One night after wed left about twelve oclock just as the house shut
up Arizona Bill says to me

Say pard have yer fixed it up to take that young woman along when you
pull up stakes

No I said isnt she a married woman and besides I havent such a
fancy for her as all that comes to

Ye hevent he said speaking very low as he always did and taking
the cigar out of his mouthBill always smoked cigars when he could
get them and not very cheap ones either well then I surmise youre
lettin her think quite contrairy and theres bound to be a muss if you
dont hide your tracks and strike a trail she cant foller on

I begin to think Ive been two ends of a dashed fool but whats a man
to do

See here now he said you hev two clar weeks afore ye You slack
off and go slow thatll let her see you didnt sorter cotton to her
morens in the regulations

And have a row with her

Sartin says Bill and hev the shootin over right away Its a
plaguey sight safer than letting her carry it in her mind and then
laying for yer some day when ye hevent nary thought of Injuns in your
head Thats the very time a woman like hers bound to close on yer and
lift yer har if she can

Why how do you know what shes likely to do

Ive been smokin pard while you hev bin talkin sorter careless
like Ive had my eyes open and seen Injun sign morn once or twice
either Ive hunted with her tribe afore I guess and old Bill aint
forgot all the totems and the war paint

After this Bill fresh lit his cigar and wouldnt say any more But I
could see what he was driving at and I settled to try all I knew to
keep everything right and square till the time came for us to make our
dart

I managed to have a quiet talk with Starlight He thought that by taking
care being very friendly but not too much so we might get clean off
without Kate or any one else being much the wiser

Next week everything seemed to go on wheelssmooth and fast no hitches
anywhere Jim reckoned the best of our claim would be worked out by
the 20th of the month and wed as good as agreed to sell our shares to
Arizona Bill and his mate who were ready as Bill said to plank down
considerable dollars for what remained of it If they got nothing worth
while it was the fortune of war which a digger never growls at no
matter how hard hit he may be If they did well they were such up and
down good fellows and such real friends to us that we should have
grudged them nothing

As for Jeanie she was almost out of her mind with eagerness to get back
to Melbourne and away from the diggings She was afraid of many of the
people she saw and didnt like others She was terrified all the
time Jim was away from her but she would not hear of living at the
Prospectors Arms with her sister

I know where that sort of thing leads to she said let us have our
own home however rough

Kate went out to Specimen Gully to see her sister pretty often and they
sat and talked and laughed just as they did in old times Jeanie said
She was a simple little thing and her heart was as pure as quartz
crystal I do really believe she was no match for Kate in any way So
the days went on I didnt dare stay away from the Prospectors Arms
for fear shed think I wanted to break with her altogether and yet I
was never altogether comfortable in her company It wasnt her fault
for she laid herself out to get round us all even old Arizona Bill who
used to sit solemnly smoking looking like an Indian chief or a graven
image until at last his brickcoloured grizzled old face would break
up all of a sudden and hed laugh like a youngster As the days drew
nigh Christmas I could see a restless expression in her face that
I never saw before Her eyes began to shine in a strange way and
sometimes shed break off short in her talk and run out of the room
Then shed pretend to wish we were gone and that shed never seen us
again I could hardly tell what to make of her and many a time I
wished we were on blue water and clear away from all chance of delay and
drawback




Chapter 30



We made up our minds to start by Saturdays coach It left at night and
travelled nigh a hundred miles by the same hour next morning Its more
convenient for getting away than the morning A chap has time for doing
all kinds of things just as he would like besides a quieter time to
slope than just after breakfast The Turon daily mail was well horsed
and well driven Nightwork though it was and the roads dangerous in
places the five big doublereflector lamps one high up over the top of
the coach in the middle with two pair more at the side made everything
plain We Cornstalks never thought of more than the regular pair of
lamps pretty low down too before the Yankee came and showed us what
crosscountry coaching was We never knew before My word they taught
us a trick or two All about riding came natural but a heap of dodges
about harness we never so much as heard of till they came to the country
with the gold rush

Wed made all our bits of preparations and thought nothing stood in the
way of a start next evening This was Friday Jim hadnt sold his bits
of traps because he didnt want it to be known he wasnt coming back
He left word with a friend he could trust though to have em all
auctioned and the goodwill of his cottage and to send the money after
him My share and his in the claim went to Arizona Bill and his mate We
had no call to be ashamed of the money that stood to our credit in the
bank That we intended to draw out and take with us in an order or a
draft or something to Melbourne Jeanie had her boxes packed and was
so wild with looking forward to seeing St Kilda beach again that she
could hardly sleep or eat as the time drew near

Friday night came everything had been settled It was the last night we
should either of us spend at the Turon for many a dayperhaps never I
walked up and down the streets smoking and thinking it all over The
idea of bed was ridiculous How wonderful it all seemed After what we
had gone through and the state we were in less than a year ago to think
that we were within so little of being clear away and safe for ever in
another country with as much as would keep us comfortable for life
I could see Gracey Aileen and Jeanie all so peaceful and loving
together with poor old mother who had lost her old trick of listening
and trembling whenever she heard a strange step or the tread of a horse
What a glorious state of things it would be A deal of it was owing to
the gold This wonderful gold But for it we shouldnt have had such a
chance in a hundred years I was that restless I couldnt settle when
I thought all of a sudden as I walked up and down that I had promised
to go and say goodbye to Kate Mullockson at the Prospectors Arms
the night before we started I thought for a moment whether it would be
safer to let it alone I had a strange unwilling kind of feeling about
going there again but at last half not knowing what else to do and
half not caring to make an enemy of Kate if I could help it I walked
up

It was latish She was standing near the bar talking to halfadozen
people at once as usual but I saw she noticed me at once She quickly
drew off a bit from them all said it was near shuttingup time and
after a while passed through the bar into the little parlour where I
was sitting down It was just midnight The night was half over before I
thought of coming in So when she came in and seated herself near me on
the sofa I heard the clock strike twelve and most of the men who were
walking about the hall began to clear out

Somehow when youve been living at a place for a goodish while and
done well there and had friends as has stuck by you as we had at the
Turon you feel sorry to leave it What youve done youre sure of
no matter how it maynt suit you in some ways nor how much better you
expect to be off where you are going to You had that and had the good
of it What the coming time may bring you cant reckon on All kinds of
cross luck and accidents may happen Whats the use of money to a man if
he smashes his hip and has to walk with a crutch all his days Ive seen
a miner with a thousand a month coming in but hed been crushed pretty
near to death with a fall of earth and about half of him was dead
Whats a good dinner to a man that his doctor only allows him one slice
of meat a bit of bread and some toast and water Ive seen chaps like
them and Id sooner a deal be the poorest splitter slogging away with
a heavy maul and able mind you to swing it like a man than one of
those brokendown screws Wed had a good time there Jim and I
We always had a kind spot in our hearts for Turon and the diggings
afterwards Hard work high pay good friends that would stick to a man
back and edge and a safe country to lie in plant in as ever was seen
We was both middlin sorry in a manner of speaking to clear out Not
as Jim said much about it on account of Jeanie but he thought it all
the same

Well of course Kate and I got talkin and talkin first about the
diggings and then about other things till we got to old times in
Melbourne and she began to look miserable and miserabler whenever she
spoke about marrying the old man and wished shed drownded herself
first She made me take a whiskya stiffish one that she mixed
herselffor a parting glass and I felt it took a bit of effect upon
me Id been having my whack during the day I wasnt no ways drunk but
I must have been touched more or less because I felt myself to be so
sober

Youre going at last Dick says she and I suppose we shant meet
again in a hurry It was something to have a look at you now and then
It reminded me of the happy old times at St Kilda

Oh come Kate I said it isnt quite so bad as all that Besides
well be back again in February as like as not Were not going for
ever

Are you telling me the truth Richard Marston says she standing up
and fixing her eyes full on mefine eyes they were too in their way
or are you trying another deceit to throw me off the scent and get rid
of me Why should you ever want to see my face after you leave

A friendly face is always pleasant Anyhow Kate yours is though
you did play me a sharpish trick once and didnt stick to me like some
women might have done

Tell me this she said leaning forward and putting one hand on my
shoulder while she seemed to look through the very soul of meher face
grew deadly pale and her lips trembled as Id seen them do once before
when she was regular beyond herselfwill you take me with you when you
go for good and all Im ready to follow you round the world Dont be
afraid of my temper No woman that ever lived ever did more for the man
she loved than Ill do for you If Jeanies good to Jimand you know
she isIll be twice the woman to you or Ill die for it Dont
speak she went on I know I threw you over once I was mad with rage
and shame You know I had cause hadnt I Dick You know I had To
spite you I threw away my own life then now its a misery and a
torment to me every day I live I can bear it no longer I tell you
Its killing mekilling me day by day Only say the word and Ill join
you in Melbourne within the weekto be yours and yours only as long
as I live

I didnt think there was that much of the loving nature about her She
used to vex me by being hard and uncertain when we were courting I knew
then she cared about me and I hadnt a thought about any other woman
Now when I didnt ask her to bother herself about me and only to let
me alone and go her own way she must turn the tables on me and want to
ruin the pair of us slap over again

Shed thrown her arms round my neck and was sobbing on my shoulder when
she finished I took her over to the sofa and made her sit down by the
side of me

Kate I said this wont do Theres neither rhyme nor reason about
it Im as fond of you as ever I was but you must know well enough
if you make a bolt of it now therell be no end of a bobbery and
everybodys thoughts will be turned our way Well be clean bowledthe
lot of us Jim and I will be jugged You and Jeanie will be left to the
mercy of the world worse off by a precious sight than ever you were
in your lives Now if you look at it whats the good of spoiling the
whole jimbang for a fancy notion about me You and I are safe to be
firstrate friends always but it will be the ruin of both of us if
were fools enough to want to be more Youre living here like a regular
queen Youve got a good husband thats proud of you and gives you
everything you can think of You took him yourself and youre bound to
stick to him Besides think of poor Jeanie and Jim Youll spoil all
their happiness and more than alldont make any mistakeyou know
what Jeanie thinks of a woman who leaves her husband for another man

If you let a woman have a regular good cry and talk herself out you
can mostly bring her round in the end So after a bit Kate grew more
reasonable That bit about Jeanie fetched her too She knew her own
sister would turn against hernot harsh like but shed never be the
same to her again as long as she lived

The lamp had been put out in the big hall There was only one in this
parlour and it wasnt over bright I talked away and last of all she
came round to my way of thinking at any rate not to want to clear off
from the old man now but to wait till I came back or till I wrote to
her

You are right Dick she said at last and you show your sense in
talking the way you have though if you loved as I do you could not
do it But once more theres no other woman that youre fonder of than
me It isnt that that makes you so good Dick Marston good and here
she laughed bitterly If I thought that I should go mad

What was I to do I could not tell her that I loved Gracey Storefield
ten times as much as Id ever cheated myself into thinking I cared about
her So I swore that I cared more for her than any woman in the whole
world and always had done so

This steadied her We parted good friends and she promised to keep
quiet and try and make the best of things She turned up the lamp to
show me the way out though the outer door of the hall was left open
night and day It was a way we had at the Turon no one troubled
themselves to be particular about such trifles as furniture and so on
There was very little small robbery there it was not worth while All
petty stealers were most severely punished into the bargain

As I stood up to say goodbye a small note dropped out of my
breastpocket It had shifted somehow Kate always had an eye like a
hawk With one spring she pounced upon it and before I could interfere
opened and read it It was Gracey Storefields She stood for one moment
and glared in my face I thought she had gone mad Then she threw the
bit of paper down and trampled upon it over and over again

So Dick Marston she cried out hoarsely her very voice changed you
have tricked me a second time Your own Gracey your own Gracey and
this by the date at the very time you were letting me persuade myself
like a fool like an idiot that I was that you still care for me You
have put the cap to your villainy now And as God made me you shall
have causegood causeto fear the woman you have once betrayed and
twice scorned Look to yourself

She gazed at me for a moment with a face from which every trace of
expression had vanished except that of the most devilish fury and
spitethe face of an evil spirit more than of a woman and then she
walked slowly away I couldnt help pitying her though I cursed my own
folly as I had done a thousand times that I had ever turned my head
or spoken a word to her when first she crossed my path I got into the
street somehow I hardly knew what to think or to do That danger
was close at our heels I didnt doubt for a moment Everything seemed
changed in a minute What was going to happen Was I the same Dick
Marston that had been strolling up Main Street a couple of hours ago
All but off by the tomorrow evenings coach and with all the world
before me a good round sum in the bank best part of a years hard
honest work it was the price of too

Then all kinds of thoughts came into my head Would Kate when her burst
of rage was over go in for revenge in cold blood She could hardly
strike me without at the same time hurting Jeanie through Jim Should
I trust her Would she come right kiss and make friends and call
herself a madwomana reckless foolas shed often done before No she
was in bitter earnest this time It did not pay to be slack in making
off Once we had been caught napping and once was enough

The first thing to do was to warn Jimpoor old Jim snoring away most
like and dreaming of taking the boxseat for himself and Jeanie at the
agents next morning It seemed cruel to wake him but it would have
been crueller not to do so

I walked up the narrow track that led up to the little gully with the
moon shining down upon the white quartz rock The pathway wound through
a blow of it I threw a pebble at the door and waited till Jim came
out

Whos there Oh its you old man is it Its rather late for a call
but if youve come to spend the evening Ill get up and well have a
smoke anyhow

You dress yourself Jim I said as quick as you can Put on your hat
and come with me theres something up

My God says Jim what is it Im a rank coward now Ive got Jeanie
Dont go and tell me weve got to cut and run again

Something like it I said If it hasnt come to that yet its not
far off

We walked up the gully together Jim lit his pipe while I told him
shortly what had happened to me with Kate

May the devil fly away with her said Jim savagely for a badminded
badhearted jade and then hed wish hed left her where she was Shed
be no chopdown there even I think sometimes she cant be Jeanies
sister at all They must have changed her and mothered the wrong child
on the old woman My word but its no laughing matter Whats to be
done

Theres no going away by the coach tomorrow Im afraid Shes just
the woman to tear straight up the camp and let it all out before her
temper cooled It would take a week to do that The sergeant or Sir
Ferdinand knows all about it now Theyll lose no time you may be
certain

And must I leave without saying goodnight to Jeanie says Jim No
by If I have halfadozen bullets through me Ill go back and hold
her in my arms once more before Im hunted off and through the country
like a wild dog once more If that infernal Kate has given us away by
George I could go and kill her with my own hand The cruel murdering
selfish brute I believe shed poison her mother for a tenpound note

No use swearing at Kate Jim I said that wont mend matters Its
not the first time by a thousand that Ive wished Id never set eyes on
her but if Id never seen her that day on St Kilda beach youd never
known Jeanie So theres evens as well as odds The thing is what are
we to do now

Dashed if I know I feel stupid about tackling the bush again and
what can I do with Jeanie I wish I was dead Ive half a mind to go and
shoot that brute of a woman and then myself But then poor Jeanie poor
little Jeanie I cant stand it Dick I shall go mad

I thought Jim was going to break out crying just as he used when he was
a boy His heart was a big soft one and though he could face anything
in the way of work or fighting that a man dare do and do two mens
share very like yet his tears mother said laid very near his eyes
and till he was a grown man they used to pump up on all sorts of
occasions

Come be a man Jim I said weve got to look the thing in the face
theres no two ways about it I shall go to Arizona Bills claim and
see what he says Anyhow Ill leave word with him what to do when were
gone Id advise you not to try to see Jeanie but if you will you must
I suppose Goodbye old man I shall make my way over to Jonathans
borrow a horse from him and make tracks for the Hollow as soon as I
can Youd better leave Jeanie here and do the same

Jim groaned but said nothing He wrung my hands till the bones seemed
to crack and walked away without a word We knew it was a chance
whether we should meet again

I walked on pretty quick till I came to the flat where Arizona Bill and
his mates had their sluicing claim There were six of them altogether
tall wiry men all of them theyd mostly been hunters and trappers in
the Rocky Mountains before the gold was struck at Suttors Mill in the
Sacramento Valley They had been digging in 49 in California but
had come over when they heard from an old mate of a placer diggings at
Turon richer than anything they had ever tried in America

This camp was half a mile from ours and there was a bit of broken
ground between so that I thought I was safe in having a word with them
before I cleared for Barness place though I took care not to go
near our own camp hut I walked over and was making straight for the
smallest hut when a rough voice hailed me

Hello stranger ye came darned near going to hl with your boots on
What did yer want agin that thar cabin

I saw then that in my hurry I had gone stumbling against a small hut
where they generally put their gold when the party had been washing up
and had more than was safe to start from camp with In this they always
put a grizzled old hunter about whom the yarn was that he never went
to sleep and could shoot anything a mile off It was thought a very
unlikely thing that any gold he watched would ever go crooked Most
people considered him a deal safer caretaker than the escort

Oh its you is it drawled Sacramento Joe Why whats doin at yer
old camp

What about said I

Wal Bill and I seen three or four halfbaked vigilantes that call
themselves police they was a setting round the hut and looked as if
they was awaiting for somebody

Tell Bill I want him Joe I said

Cant leave guard nohow says the true grit old hunter pointing to
his revolver and dodging up and down with his lame leg a crooked arm
and a seam in his face like a terrible wound there some time or other
I darsnt leave guard Youll find him in that centre tent with the
red flag on it

I lifted the canvas flap of the door and went in Bill raised himself in
the bed and looked at me quite coolly

I was to your location a while since he said Met some friends
of yours there too I didnt cotton to em muchly Something has
eventuated Is that so

Yes I want your help I told him shortly all I could tell him in the
time

     

He listened quietly and made no remark for a time

So ye hev bin a road agent You and Jim that darned innocent old
cuss robbing mails and cattle ranches It is a real scoop up for me
you bet Id heern of bushranging in Australia but I never reckoned
on their bein men like you and Jim So the muchacha went back on
yersnakes alive I kinder expected it I reckon youre bound to git

Yes Bill sharps the word I want you to draw my money and Jims out
of the bank its all in my name Theres the deposit receipt Ill back
it over to you You give Jeanie what she wants and send the rest when I
tell you Will you do that for me Bill Ive always been on the square
with you and your mates

You hev boy that Ill not deny and Ill corral the dollars for you
Its an allfired muss that men like you and Jim should have a black
mark agin your record A spry hunter Jim would have made Id laid out
to have had him to Arizona yetand youre a going to dust out right
away you say

Im off now Jims waited too long I expect One other thing let Mr
Haughton across the creek have this before daylight

What the Honourable Lawful heart Wal I hope ye may strike a
better trail yet Yer young you and Jim poor old Jim Hold on Hev ye
nary shootin iron

No time I said I havent been to the camp

Go slow then Wait here youll want suthin may be on the peraira
If ye do boy Jim made good shootin with this ye mind Take it and
welcome itll mind ye of old Arizona Bill

He handed me a beautifully finished little repeating rifle hardly
heavier than a navy revolver and a small bag of cartridges

Thar thatll be company for ye in case ye hev to draw a bead on
theany onejust tempry like Our horses is hobbled in Batess
clearing Take my old sorrel if ye can catch him He stopped for a
second and put his hand in a listening fashion His hunters ear was
quicker than mine Thars a war party on the trail I reckon Its
a roughish crossing at Slatey Bar and he pointed towards the river
which we could plainly hear rushing over a rocky bed We shook hands
and as I turned down the steep river bank I saw him walk slowly into his
tent and close the canvas after him

The line he pointed to was the one I fixed in my own mind to take long
before our talk was over The Turon always steepbanked rocky in
places ran here under an awful high bluff of slate rock The rushing
water in its narrow channel had worn away the rock a good deal and left
ledges or bars under which a deal of gold had been found Easy enough to
cross here on a kind of natural ford We had many a time walked over on
Sundays and holidays for a little kangarooshooting now and then It was
here Jim one day when we were all together for a ramble surprised the
Americans by his shooting with the little Ballard rifle

As I crossed there was just moon enough to show the deep pools and the
hurrying tearing waters of the wild river foaming betwixt the big
boulders and jags of rock which the bar was strewed with In front the
bank rose 300 feet like the roof of a house with great overhanging
crags of slate rock and a narrow track in and out between If I had
light enough to find this and get to the topthe country was terribly
rough for a few miles with the darkness coming onI should be pretty
well out of reach by daylight

I had just struck the track when I heard voices and a horses tramp
on the other side of the river They seemed not to be sure whether Id
crossed or not and were tracking up and down on each side of the bar I
breasted the hill track faster than I had done for many a day and when
I got to the top stopped to listen but could hear nothing The moon
had dropped suddenly the forest was as black as pitch You couldnt see
your hand before you

I knew that I was safe now if a hundred men were at my heels till
daybreak at any rate I had the two sides of the gully to guide me I
could manage to make to the farm where the sorrel was at grass with a
lot of other diggers horses If I could get a saddle and catch the
old horse I could put many a mile between me and them before sundown
I stood still when I reached the top of the bluff partly to get breath
and partly to take a last look at old Turon

Below lay the goldfield clearly marked out by hundreds of campfires
that were still red and showed bright in the darkened sky The course
of the river was marked by them in and out as most of the shallow
diggings had followed the river flats Far back the fires glowed against
the black forest and just before the moon fell I could catch the shine
of the water in the deeper reaches of the river

It was the very picture of what Id read about an army in camplines
of tents and a crowd of men all spread out over a bit of land hardly
big enough for a flock of sheep Now and then a dog would barknow
a revolver would go off It was never quiet on Turon diggings day or
night

Well there they all were tents and diggers claims and windlasses
pumps and waterwheels I had been happy enough there God knows and
perhaps I was looking at it all for the last time As I turned and made
down the hill into the black forest that spread below me like the sea
I felt as if I was leaving everything that was any good in life behind
with the Turon lights and being hunted once more in spite of myself
into a desert of darkness and despair




Chapter 31



I got to Batess paddocks about daylight and went straight up to the
hut where the man lived that looked after it Most of the diggers that
cared about their horses paid for their grass in farmers and squatters
paddocks though the price was pretty high Old Bates who had a bit
of a good grassed flat made a pretty fair thing out of it by taking in
horses at halfacrown a week apiece As luck would have it the man in
charge knew me hed seen me out with the Yankees one day and saw I
was a friend with them and when I said Id come for Bills sorrel he
thought it likely enough and got out the saddle and bridle I tipped
him well and went off telling him I was going to Wattle Flat to look
at a quartzcrushing plant that was for sale I accounted for coming up
so early by saying Id lost my road and that I wanted to get to Wattle
Flat sharp as another chap wished to buy the plant I cut across the
range kept the sun on my right hand and pushed on for Jonathans I
got there early and its well I did I rode the sorrel hard but I knew
he was pretty tough and I was able to pay for him if I killed him I
trusted to leaving him at Jonathans and getting a fresh horse there
What with the walk over the bluff and the forest having no sleep the
night before and the bother and trouble of it all I was pretty well
used up I was real glad to see Jonathans paddock fence and the old
house wed thought so little of lately Its wonderful how soon people
rise grand notions and begin to get too big for their boots

Hello Dick whats up says Jonathan No swag lasticside boots
flyaway tie new rifle old horse looks a bit fishy dont it

I cant stop barneying I said Have you a decent horse to give
me The games up I must ride night and day till I get home Heard
anything

No but Billy the Boys just rode up I hear him atalkin to the gals
He knows if anybody does Ill take the old moke and put him in the
paddock I can let you have a stunner

All right Ill go in and have some breakfast Its as much as I dare
stop at all now

Why Dick Marston is that you No it cant be said both girls
together Why you look like a ghost He doesnt he looks as if hed
been at a ball all night Plenty of partners Dick

Never mind Dick says Maddie go and make yourself comfortable in
that room and Ill have breakfast for you while youd let a cow out of
the bail We dont forget our friends

If all our friends were as true as you Maddie I said rather
downlike I shouldnt be here today

Oh thats it is it says she were only indebted to somebodys
laying the traps ona woman of coursefor your honours company Never
mind old man I wont hit you when youre down But I say you go and
have a yarn with Billy the Boyhes in the kitchen I believe the young
imp knows something but he wont let on to Bell and I

While the steaks were fryingand they smelt very good bad as I feltI
called out Master Billy and had a talk with him I handed him a note to
begin with It was money well spent and you mark my words a
shilling spent in grog often buys a man twenty times the worth of it in
information let alone a pound

Billy had grown a squarishset middlesized chap his hair wasnt
so long and his clothes were better his eye was as bright and
boldlooking As he stood tapping one of his boots with his whip he
looked for all the world like a bullterrier

My colonial oath Dick youre quite the gentlemanfree with your
money just the same as ever You takes after the old governor he always
paid well if you told him the truth I remember him giving me a hidin
when I was a kiddy for saying something I wasnt sure of My word I was
that sore for a week after I couldnt button my shirt But aint it a
pity about Jim

Oh thats it What about Jim

Why the pleece grabbed him of course You fellers dont think youre
going on for ever and ever keepin the country in a state of terrorism
as the papers say No Dick its wrong and wicked and sinful Youll
have to knock under and give us young uns a chance

Here the impudent young rascal looked in my face as bold as brass and
burst out laughing He certainly was the cheekiest young scoundrel I
ever came across But in his own line you couldnt lick him

Jims took he said and he looked curiously over at me I seen the
pleece atakin him across the country to Bargo early this morning
There was poor old Jim alookin as if he was goin to be hanged with a
chap leading the screw he was on and Jims long legs tied underneath I
was gatherin cattle I was I drew some up just for a stall and had a
good look

How many men were with him

Only two and theyre to pass through Bargo Brush about sundown
tonight or a bit earlier I asked one of the men the road said Id
lost myself and would be late home Ha ha ha

And how the young villain laughed till the tears came into his eyes
while he danced about like a blackfellow

See here Billy I said heres another pound for you and therell
be a fiver after if you stick well to me today I wont let Jim be
walked off to Berrima without a flutter to save him Itll be the death
of him Hes not like me and hes got a young wife besides

More fool he Dick What does a cross cove want with a wife He cant
never expect to do any good with a wife follerin of him about Im
agin marrying leastways as long as a chaps sound on his pins But Ill
stick to you Dick and whats more I can take you a short cut to the
brush and we can wait in a gully and see the traps come up You have
a snack and lie down for a bit I seen you were done when you came up
Ill have the horses ready saddled up

How about the police Suppose they come this way

Not they They split and took across towards the Mountain Hut where
you all camped with the horses I didnt see em but I cut their
tracks Five shod horses They might be here tomorrow

A bush telegraph aint a bad thing Theyre not all as good as Billy the
Boy But the worst of em like a bad sheep dog is a deal better than
none

A bush telegraph you see is mostly worked about the neighbourhood he
was born in Hes not much good anywhere else Hes like a blackfellow
outside of his own tauri Hes at sea But within twenty or thirty
miles of where he was born and bred he knows every track every range
every hill every creek as well as all the short cuts and byroads He
can bring you miles shorter than any one that only follows the road He
can mostly track like a blackfellow and tell you whether the cattle or
horses which he sees the tracks of are belonging to his country or are
strangers He can get you a fresh horse on a pinch night or day for
he knows everybodys paddocks and yards as well as the number looks
pace and pluck of everybodys riding horsesof many of which he has
taken a turn out ofthat is ridden them hard and far and returned
them during the night Of course he can be finedeven imprisoned for
thiswhen he is caught in the act Herein lies the difficulty I felt
like another man after a wash a nip and a real good meal with the two
girls sitting close by and chattering away as usual

Do you know says Bella it half serves you right Not that that Port
Phillip woman was right to peach She ought to have had her tongue torn
out first let alone go openmouthed at it But mightnt you have come
down here from the Turon on Sundays and holidays now and then and had a
yarn with us all

Of course we ought and we deserve to be kickedthe lot of us but
there were good reasons why we didnt like to We were regularly boxed
up with the diggers nobody knew who we were or where we came from and
only for this Jezebel never would have known If wed come here theyd
have all dropped that we were old friends and then theyd have known
all about us

Well Im glad youve lost your characters says Maddie You wont
have to be so particular now and you can come as often as Sir Ferdinand
will let you Goodbye Billys waving his hat

It wasnt long before I was in the saddle and off again Id made a
bit of a bargain with Jonathan who sold me a pair of riding boots
butchers and a big tweed poncho The boots were easier to take a long
rough ride in than trousers and I wanted the poncho to keep the Ballard
rifle under It wouldnt do to have it in your hand all the time

As we rode along I settled upon the way Id try and set poor Jim free
Bad off as I was myself I couldnt bear to see him chained up and
knew that he was going for years and years to a place more wicked and
miserable than hed ever heard of

After riding twenty miles the sun was getting low when Billy pointed to
a trail which came broad ways across the road and which then followed
it

Here they arepleece and no mistake Heres their horses tracks
right enough Heres the prisoners horse see how he stumbled and this
road theyre bound to go till they cross the Stony point and get into
Bargo Brush near a creek

We had plenty of time by crossing a range and running a blind creek down
to be near the place where the troopers must pass as they crossed the
main creek We tied up the horses a hundred yards distance behind us
in the forest and I made ready to rescue Jim if it could be managed
anyhow

How was it to be done I could depend on the rifle carrying true at
short ranges but I didnt like the notion of firing at a man behind his
back like I hardly knew what to do when all of a sudden two policemen
showed up at the end of the track nearest the creek

One man was a bit in frontriding a fine horse too The next one had a
led horse on which rode poor old Jim looking as if he was going to be
hanged that day as Billy said though I knew well he wasnt thinking
about himself I dont believe Jim ever looked miserable for so long
since he was born Whatever happened to him before hed have a cry or
a fight and it would be over But now his poor old face looked that
wretched and miserable as if hed never smile again as long as he
lived He didnt seem to care where they took him and when the old
horse stumbled and close upon fell down he didnt take notice

When I saw that my mind was made up I couldnt let them take him away
to his death I could see he wouldnt live a month Hed go fretting
his life about Jeanie and after the free life hed always led hed fall
sick like the blacks when theyre shut up and die without any reason
but because a wild bird wont live in a cage

So I took aim and waited till they were just crossing the creek into the
forest The leading man was just riding up the bank and the one that
led Jims horse was on the bit of a sand bed that the water had brought
down He was the least bit ahead of Jim when I pulled trigger and sent
a ball into him just under the collarbone I fired high on purpose
He drops off his saddle like a dead man The next minute Billy the Boy
raises the most awful corroboree of screams and howls enough for a
whole gang of bushrangers if they went in for that sort of thing He
emptied four chambers of his revolver at the leading trooper right away
and I fired at his horse The constable never doubtedthe attack was so
sudden and savage likebut there was a party of men hid in the brush
Billys shots had whistled round him and mine had nearly dropped his
horse so he thought it no shame to make a bolt and leave his mate as
seemed very bad hit in our hands

His horses handgallop growed fainter and fainter in the distance
and then we unbound poor Jim set his feet at liberty and managed to
dispose of the handcuffs Jims face began to look more cheerful but
he was down in the mouth again when he saw the wounded man He began at
once to do all he could for him We stopped a short distance behind the
brush which had already helped us well

Jim propped up the poor chap whose lifeblood was flowing red through
the bullethole and made him as comfortable as he could I must take
your horse mate he says but you know its only the fortune of war
A man must look after himself Some onell come along the road soon
He mounted the troopers horse and we slipped through the treesit
was getting dark nowtill we came to our horses Then we all rode off
together We took Billy the Boy with us until he put us on to a road
that led us into the country that we knew We could make our own way
from there and so we sent off our scout telling him to ride to the
nearest township and say hed seen a trooper lying badly wounded by the
Bargo Brush roadside The sooner he was seen to the better chance hed
have

Jim brightened up considerably after this He told me how hed gone
back to say goodbye to Jeaniehow the poor girl went into fits and
he couldnt leave her By the time she got better the cottage was
surrounded by police there was no use being shot down without a chance
so he gave himself up

My word Dick he said I wished for a barebacked horse and a deep
gully then but it wasnt to be There was no horse handy and Id only
have been carried into my own place a dead man and frightened the life
out of poor Jeanie as well

Youre worth a dozen dead men yet Jim I said Keep up your pecker
old man Well get across to the Hollow some time within the next
twentyfour hours and there well be safe anyhow They cant touch
Jeanie you know and youre not short of what cash shell want to keep
her till this blows over a bit

And what am I to do all the time he says so pitiful like Were that
fond of one another Dick that I couldnt hardly bear her out of my
sight and now Ill be months and months and months without a look
at her pretty face where Ive never seen anything yet but love and
kindness Too good for me she always was and what have I brought her
to My God Dick I wish youd shot me instead of the constable poor
devil

Well you wasnt very far apart I says chaffing like If that old
horse they put you on had bobbed forward level with him youd have got
plugged instead But its no use giving in Jim We must stand up to our
fight now or throw up the sponge Theres no two ways about it

We rattled on then without speaking and never cried crack till we got
to Nulla Mountain where we knew we were pretty safe not to be followed
up We took it easier then and stopped to eat a bit of bread and meat
the girls had put up for me at Jonathans Id never thought of it
before When I took the parcel out of the pocket of my poncho I thought
it felt deuced heavy and there sure enough was one of those shilling
flasks of brandy they sell for chaps to go on the road with

Brandy aint a good thing at all times and seasons and Ive seen more
than one man or a dozen either that might just as well have sawed
away at their throats with a blunt knife as put the first glass to their
lips But we was both hungry thirsty tired miserable and pretty well
done and beaten though we hadnt had time to think about it That drop
of brandy seemed as if it had saved our lives I never forgot it nor
poor Maddie Barnes for thinking of it for me And I did live to do her
a good turn backmuch as theres been said again me and true enough
too

It was a long way into the night and not far from daylight either when
we stumbled up to the cavedead beat horses and men both Wed two
minds to camp on the mountain but we might have been followed up hard
as wed ridden and we didnt like to throw a chance away We didnt
want the old man to laugh at us and we didnt want to do any more time
in Berrimanot now anyhow Wed been living too gay and free a life to
begin with the jug all over again

So we thought wed make one job of it and get right through if we had
to sleep for a week after it It would be slow enough but anything was
better than what wed gone through lately

After wed got down the mountain and on the flat land of the valley
it rested our feet a bit that was pretty nigh cut to pieces with the
rocks Our horses were that done we dursnt ride em for hours before
As we came close out walks old Crib and smells at us He knew us in
a minute and jumped up and began to try and lick Jims hand the old
story He just gave one sort of sniff at me as much as to say Oh
its you is it Then he actually gave a kind of halfbark I dont
believe hed barked for years such a queer noise it was Anyhow it
woke up dad and he came out pretty sharp with a revolver in his hand
As soon as he saw the old dog walking alongside of us he knew it was
right and begins to feel for his pipe First thing father always did as
soon as any work or fighting or talking was over was to get out his pipe
and light it He didnt seem the same man without it

So youve found your way back again have ye he says Why I thought
you was all on your way to Californy by this time Aint this Christmas
week Why I was expecting to come over to Ameriky myself one of these
days when all the derry was over Why whats up with the boy

Jim was standing by sayin nothing while I was taking off the saddles
and bridles and letting the horses go when all of a sudden he gives a
lurch forward and if the old man hadnt laid hold of him in his strong
arms and propped him up hed have gone down face foremost like a girl in
a dead faint

Whats up with him Dick says father rather quick almost as if he
was fond of him and had some natural feelingsometimes I raly think he
hadbeen any shooting

Yes not at him though Tell you all about it in the morning Hes
eaten nothing and weve been travelling best part of twentyfour hours
right off the reel

Hold him up while I fetch out the pannikin Theres plenty of grub
inside Hell be all right after a sleep

A drop of rum and water brought him to and after that we made ourselves
a cup of tea and turned in The sun was pretty high when I woke When
I looked out there was the old man sitting on the log by the fire
smoking What was a deal more curious I saw the halfcaste Warrigal
coming up from the flat leading a horse and carrying a pair of hobbles
Something made me look over to a particular corner where Starlight
always slept when he was at the Hollow Sure enough there was the figure
of a man rolled up in a cloak I knew by the way his boots and things
were thrown about that it could be no other than Starlight




Chapter 32



Id settled in my mind that it couldnt be any one else when he sat up
yawned and looked round as if he had not been away from the old place a
week

Ha Richard here we are again Feeds the boar in the old frank The
governor told me you and Jim had made back Dreadful bore isnt it
Just when wed all rubbed off the rust of our bush life and were getting
civilised I feel very seriously illtreated I assure you I have a
great mind to apply to the Government for compensation Thats the worst
of these new inspectors they are so infernally zealous

You were too many for them it seems I half thought you might have
been nailed How the deuce did you get the office in time

The faithful Warrigal as usual gave me timely warning and brought a
horse of course He will appear on the Judgment Day leading Rainbow
I firmly believe Why he should be so confoundedly anxious about my
welfare I cant make outI cant really Its his peculiar form of
mania I suppose We all suffer from some madness or other

How the blazes did he know the police were laid on to the lot of us I
said

I didnt know myself that your Kate had come the double on you I might
have known she would though Well it seems Warrigal took it into his
semibarbaric head to ride into Turon and loaf about partly to see me
and partly about another matter that your father laid him on about He
was standing about near the Prospectors Arms late on Friday night
doing nothing and seeing everything as usual when he noticed Mrs
Mullockson run out of the house like a Bedlamite My word that missis
big one coolah was his expression and made straight for the camp Now
Warrigal had seen you come out just before He doesnt like you and Jim
over muchbad taste I tell him on his partbut I suppose he looks
upon you as belonging to the family So he stalked the fair and furious
Kate

That was how it was then

Yes much in that way I must say Dick that if you are so extremely
fond ofwellstudying the female character you should carry on the
pursuit more discreetly Just see what this miscalculation has cost your
friends

Confound her Shes a heartless wretch and I hope shell die in a
ditch

Exactly Well she knocked and a constable opened the outer door

I want to see Sir Ferdinand she says

Hes in bed and cant be disturbed says the bobby Any message I
can deliver

I have important information says she Rouse him up or youll be
sorry for it

Wont it do tomorrow morning says he

No it wont says she stamping her foot Do what I tell you and
dont stand there like a fool

She waited a bit Then Warrigal says out came Sir Ferdinand very
polite What can I do for you says he Mrs Mullockson

Should you like to know where the Marstons are Sir Ferdinand says
she Dick and Jim

Know Would I not says he No end of warrants out for them since
that Ballabri Bank robbery they seem to have disappeared under ground
And that fellow Starlight too Most remarkable man of his day Id give
my eyes to put the bracelets upon him

She whispered something into his ear

Guard turn out he roars out first then dropping his voice says
out My dear Mrs Mullockson you should hear Warrigal imitate him
you have made my fortuneofficially I mean of course I shall never
forget your kindness Thanks a thousand times

Dont thank me she says and she burst out crying and goes slowly
back to the hotel

Warrigal had heard quite enough He rips over to Dalys mob borrows a
horse saddle and bridle and leads him straight down to our camp He
roused me up about one oclock and I could hardly make any explanation
to my mates Such stunning good fellows they were too I wonder whether
I shall ever associate with gentlemen again The chances are against it

I had all kinds of trouble to tell them I was going away with Warrigal
and yet not to tell too much

What the dickens says Clifford can you want going away with this
familiar of yours at this hour of the night Youre like the fellow
in Scotts novel Anne of Geierstein that I was reading over again
yesterdaythe mysterious stranger thats called for at midnight by the
Avenger of Blood departs with him and is never seen more

In case you never see me afterwards I said wed better say
goodbye Weve been good mates and true friends havent we

Never better he said I dont know what we shall do without you
But of course youre not going very far

Goodbye in case I said Anyhow Ill write you a line and as I
shook hands with themtwo regular trumps if ever there were any in the
worldI had a kind of notion Id never see them again Hardly think I
shall either Sir Ferdinand surrounded the hut about an hour later and
made them come out one by oneboth of them and the wages man I daresay
they were surprised

Wheres the fourth man Clifford says Sir Ferdinand Just ask him
to come out will you

What Frank Haughton says he

I heard most of this from that young devil Billy the Boy He saw Sir
Ferdinand ride up so he hid close by just for the fun of hearing how
he got on Hed seen Warrigal and me ride away

Frank Devil bangs out Sir Ferdinand whod begun to get his monkey
up How should I know his infernal pursers name No man it seems
to me has his right name on this confounded goldfield I mean
StarlightStarlight the cattle stealer the mail robber the
bushranger whose name is notorious over the three colonies and New
Zealand to bootyour intimate friend and partner for the last nine
months

You perfectly amaze me says Clifford But cant you be mistaken Is
your information to be depended upon

Mine came from a jealous woman says Sir Ferdinand They may
generally be depended upon for a straight tip But were losing time
When did he leave the claim and which way did he go

I have no idea which way he went says Clifford He did not say but
he left about an hour since

On foot or on horseback

On horseback

Any one with him

Yes another horseman

What was he like

Slight dark man youngish goodlooking

Warrigal the halfcaste By George warrants out for him also says
Sir Ferdinand On a good horse of course with an hours start We may
give up the idea of catching him this time Follow him up as a matter of
form Goodbye Clifford Youll hear news of your friend before long
or Im much mistaken

Stop Sir Ferdinand you must pardon me but I dont exactly
understand your tone The man that we knew by the name of Frank Haughton
may be as you say an escaped criminal All I know is that he lived
with us since we came here and that no fellow could have behaved more
truly like a man and a gentleman As far as we are concerned I have a
material guarantee that he has been scrupulously honest Do you mean to
hint for one moment that we were aware of his previous history or in
any way mixed up with his acts

If I do what then says Sir Ferdinand laughing

The affair is in no way ludicrous says Clifford very stiff and
dignified I hold myself to have received an insult and must ask you
to refer me to a friend

Do you know that I could arrest you and Hastings now and lock you up
on suspicion of being concerned with him in the Ballabri Bank robbery
says Sir Ferdinand in a stern voice Dont look so indignant I only
say I could I am not going to do so of course As to fighting you
my dear fellow I am perfectly at your service at all times and seasons
whenever I resign my appointment as Inspector of Police for the colony
of New South Wales The Civil Service regulations do not permit of
duelling at present and I found it so deuced hard to work up to the
billet that I am not going to imperil my continuance therein After all
I had no intention of hurting your feelings and apologise if I did As
for that rascal Starlight he would deceive the very devil himself

And so Sir Ferdinand rode off

How did you come by Jonathans

We called nowhere Warrigal as usual made a short cut of his own
across the bushscrubs gullies mountains all manner of desert paths
We made the Hollow yesterday afternoon and went to sleep in a nook
known to us of old We dropped in to breakfast here at daylight and I
felt sleepy enough for another snooze

Were all here again it seems I said sour enough I suppose well
have to go on the old lay they wont let us alone when were doing fair
work and behaving ourselves like men They must take the consequences
dn them

Ha very true says Starlight in his dreamy kind of way Most true
Richard Society should make a truce occasionally or proclaim an
amnesty with offenders of our stamp It would pay better than driving
us to desperation How is Jim Hes worse off than either of us poor
fellow

Jims very bad He cant get over being away from Jeanie I never saw
him so down in the mouth this years

Poor old Jim hes a deal too good for the place Sad mistake this
getting married People should either keep straight or have no relatives
to bear the brunt of their villainies But soft as they say in the
play where am I I thought I was a virtuous miner again Here we are
at this devildiscovered demonhaunted old Hollow againfirst cousin
to the pit of Acheron Theres no help for it Dick We must play our
parts gallantly as demons of this lower world or get hissed off the
stage

     

We didnt do much for a few days you may be sure There was nothing to
do for one thing and we hadnt made up our mind what our line was to
be One thing was certain there would be more row made about us than
ever We should have all the police in the country worried and barked
at by the press the people the Government and their superior officers
till they got something to show about us Living at the diggings under
the nose of the police without their having the least suspicion who
we were was bad enough but the rescue of Jim and the shooting of a
policeman in charge of him was more seriousthe worst thing that had
happened yet

There would be the devil to pay if they couldnt find a track of us No
doubt money would be spent like water in bribing any one who might give
information about us Every one would be tried that we had ever been
known to be friendly with A special body of men could be told off to
make a dart to any spot they might get wind of near where we had been
last seen

We had long talks and barneys over the whole thingsometimes by
ourselves with Starlight sometimes with father A long time it was
before we settled upon any regular putup bit of work to do

Sooner or later we began to see the secret of the Hollow would be
found out There was no great chance in the old times with only a few
shepherds and stockriders wandering through the bush once in a way
straggling over the country But now the whole colony swarmed with
miners who were always prospecting as they called itthat is looking
out for fresh patches of gold Now small parties of these menbold
hardy experienced chapswould take a pick and shovel a bucket and
a tin dish with a few weeks rations and scour the whole countryside
They would try every creek gully hillside and river bed If they
found the colour of gold the least trace of it in a dish of washdirt
they would at once settle down themselves If it went rich the news
would soon spread and a thousand men might be gathered in one spotthe
bank of a small creek the side of a steep rangewithin a fortnight
with ten thousand more sure to follow within a month

That might happen at any time on one of the spurs of Nulla Mountain
and the finding out of the track down to the Hollow by some one of the
dozens of rambling shooting fishing diggers would be as certain to
happen as the sun to rise

Well the country had changed and we were bound to change with it
We couldnt stop boxed up in the Hollow day after day and month after
month shooting and horsebreaking doing nothing and earning nothing

If we went outside there were ten times more men looking out for us than
ever ten times more chance of our being tracked or run down than ever
That we knew from the newspapers How did we see them Oh the old way
We sent out our scout Warrigal and he got our letters and papers too
from a sure hand as Starlight said the old people in the English wars
used to say

The papers were something to see First he brought us in a handbill that
was posted in Bargo like this


 FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REWARD

The above reward will be paid to any one giving information as to the
whereabouts of Richard Marston James Marston and a man whose name
is unknown but who can be identified chiefly by the appellation of
Starlight


Pleasing way of drawing attention to a gentlemans private residence
says Starlight smiling first and looking rather grim afterwards Never
mind boys theyll increase that reward yet by Jove It will have to
be a thousand a piece if they dont look a little sharper

We laughed and dad growled out

Dont seem to have the pluck any on ye to tackle a big touch again I
expect theyll send a summons for us next and get old Bill Barkis the
bailiff at Bargo to serve it

Come come governor says Starlight none of that Weve got quite
enough devil in us yet without your stirring him up You must give us
time you know Lets see what this paper says Turon Star What a
godsend to it


 BUSHRANGERS

 STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS AGAIN

The announcement will strike our readers if not with the most
profound astonishment certainly with considerable surprise that these
celebrated desperadoes for whose apprehension such large sums have
been offered for whom the police in all the colonies have made such
unremitting search should have been discovered in our midst Yet
such is the case On this very morning from information received our
respected and efficient Inspector of Police Sir Ferdinand Morringer
proceeded soon after midnight to the camp of Messrs Clifford and
Hastings He had every reason to believe that he would have had no
difficulty in arresting the famous Starlight who under the cognomen
of the Honourable Frank Haughton has been for months a partner in this
claim The shareholders were popularly known as the three Honourables
it being rumoured that both Mr Clifford and Mr Hastings were entitled
to that prefix if not to a more exalted one

With characteristic celerity however the famous outlaw had shortly
before quitted the place having received warning and been provided with
a fast horse by his singular retainer Warrigal a halfcaste native
of the colony who is said to be devotedly attached to him and who has
been seen from time to time on the Turon

Of the Marston brothers the elder one Richard would seem to have
been similarly apprised but James Marston was arrested in his cottage
in Specimen Gully Having been lately married he was apparently
unwilling to leave his home and lingered too long for prudence

While rejoicing as must all good citizens at the discovery of
evildoers and the capture of one member of a band of notorious
criminals we must state in fairness and candour that their conduct has
been while on the field as miners free from reproach in every way For
James Marston who was married but a short while since to a Melbourne
young lady of high personal attractions and the most winning amiability
great sympathy has been expressed by all classes


So much for the Star Everybody is sorry for you old man he says to
Jim I shouldnt wonder if theyd make you a beak if youd stayed there
long enough Im afraid Dicks dropping the policeman wont add to our
popularity though

Hes all right I said Hurrah look here Im glad I didnt finish
the poor beggar Listen to this from the Turon Banner


 BUSHRANGING REVIVED

The good old days have apparently not passed away for ever when mail
robberies and handtohand conflicts with armed robbers were matters
of weekly occurrence The comparative lull observable in such exciting
occurrences of late has been proved to be but the ominous hush of the
elements that precedes the tempest Within the last few days the mining
community has been startled by the discovery of the notorious gang of
bushrangers Starlight and the Marstons domiciled in the very heart
of the diggings attired as ordinary miners andfor their own purposes
possiblyleading the laborious lives proper to the avocation They have
been fairly successful and as miners it is said have shown themselves
to be manly and fairdealing men We are not among those who care to
judge their fellowmen harshly It may be that they had resolved to
forsake the criminal practices which had rendered them so unhappily
celebrated James Marston had recently married a young person of most
respectable family and prepossessing appearance As far as may be
inferred from this step and his subsequent conduct he had cut loose
from his former habitudes He with his brother Richard Marston worked
an adjoining claim to the Arizona Sluicing Company with the respected
shareholders of which they were on terms of intimacy The wellknown
Starlight as Mr Frank Haughton became partner and tentmate with the
Hon Mr Clifford and Mr Hastings an aristocratic society in which the
manners and bearing of this extraordinary man permitted him to mingle
without suspicion of detection

Suddenly information was furnished to the police respecting all three
men We are not at present aware of the source from which the clue
was obtained Suffice it to say that Sir Ferdinand Morringer promptly
arranged for the simultaneous action of three parties of police with
the hope of capturing all three outlaws But in two cases the birds were
flown Starlights ame damnee a halfcaste named Warrigal had been
observed on the field the day before By him he was doubtless furnished
with a warning and the horse upon which he left his abode shortly
before the arrival of Sir Ferdinand The elder Marston had also eluded
the police But James Marston hindered possibly by domestic ties was
captured at his cottage at Specimen Gully For him sympathy has been
universally expressed He is regarded rather as a victim than as an
active agent in the many criminal offences chargeable to the account of
Starlights gang

Since writing the above we have been informed that trooper Walsh who
with another constable was escorting James Marston to Bargo Gaol has
been brought in badly wounded The other trooper reports that he was
shot down and the party attacked by persons concealed in the thick
timber near Wild Horse Creek at the edge of Bargo Brush In the
confusion that ensued the prisoner escaped It was at first thought that
Walsh was fatally injured but our latest report gives good hope of his
recovery

We shall be agreeably surprised if this be the end and not the
commencement of a series of darker tragedies




Chapter 33



A months loafing in the Hollow Nothing doing and nothing to think of
except what was miserable enough God knows Then things began to shape
themselves in a manner of speaking We didnt talk much together but
each man could see plain enough what the others was thinking of Dad
growled out a word now and then and Warrigal would look at us from time
to time with a flash in his hawks eyes that wed seen once or twice
before and knew the meaning of As for Jim we were bound to do
something or other if it was only to keep him from going melancholy
mad I never seen any man changed more from what he used to be than
Jim did He that was the most careless happygolucky chap that ever
stepped always in a good temper and full of his larks At the end of
the hottest day in summer on the plains with no water handy or the
middle of the coldest winter night in an ironbark forest and we sitting
on our horses waiting for daylight with the rain pouring down our
backs not game to light a fire and our hands that cold we could hardly
hold the reins it was all one to Jim Always jolly always ready to
make little of it all Always ready to laugh or chaff or go on with
monkey tricks like a boy Now it was all the other way with him Hed
sit grizzling and smoking by himself all day long No getting a word out
of him The only time he seemed to brighten up was once when he got a
letter from Jeanie He took it away into the bush and stayed hours and
hours

From never thinking about anything or caring what came uppermost he
seemed to have changed all on the other tack and do nothing but think
Id seen a chap in Berrima something like him for a month or two one
day he manned the barbers razor and cut his throat I began to be
afraid Jim would go off his head and blow his brains out with his own
revolver Starlight himself got to be cranky and restlesslike too One
night he broke out as we were standing smoking under a tree a mile or
so from the cave

By all the devils Dick I cant stand this sort of thing much longer
We shall go mad or drink ourselves to deathwed all been pretty well
on the night beforeif we stick here till were trapped or smoked
out like a guana out of a tree spout We must make a rise somehow
and try for blue water again Ive been fighting against the notion the
whole time weve been here but the devil and your old dad whos a near
relative I believe have been too strong for us Of course you know
what its bound to be

I suppose so I know when dad was away last week he saw that beggar and
some of his mates They partly made it up awhile back but didnt fancy
doing it altogether by themselves Theyve been waiting on the chance of
our standing in and your taking command

Of course the old story he says throwing his cigar away and giving
a half laughsuch a laugh it was too Captain Starlight again I
suppose The paltry vanity of leadership and of being in the front of
my fellowmen has been the ruin of me ever since I could recollect If
my people had let me go into the army as I begged and prayed of them to
do it might have been all the other way I recollect that day and hour
when my old governor refused my boyish petition laughed at mesneered
at me I took the wrong road then I swear to you Dick I never
had thought of evil till that cursed day which made me reckless and
indifferent to everything And this is the enda wasted life a felons
doom Quite melodramatic isnt it Richard Well well play out the
last act with spirit Enter first robber and so on Goodnight

He walked away I never heard him say so much about himself before
It set me thinking of what luck and chance there seemed to be in this
world How men were not let do what they knew was best for emoften
and oftenbut something seemed to drive em farther and farther along
the wrong road like a lot of stray wild cattle that wants to make back
to their own run and a dog here a fence the other way A man on foot
or a flock of sheep always keeps frightening em farther and farther
from the old beat till they get back into a bit of back country or
mallee scrub and stop there for good Cattle and horses and men and
women are awful like one another in their ways and the more you watch
em the more it strikes you

Another day or two idling and cardplaying another headache after too
much grog at night brought us to a regular go in about business and
then we fixed it for good

We were to stick up the next monthly gold escort That was all We knew
it would be a heavy one and trusted to our luck to get clear off
with the gold and then take a ship for Honolulu or San Francisco A
desperate chance but we were desperate men We had tried to work hard
and honest We had done so for best part of a year No one could say we
had taken the value of a halfpenny from any man And yet we were not let
stay right when we asked for nothing but to be let alone and live out
the rest of our lives like men

They wouldnt have us that way and now they must take us across the
grain and see what they would gain by that So it happened we went out
one day with Warrigal to show us the way and after riding for hours and
hours we came to a thick scrub We rode through it till we came to an
old cattle track We followed that till we came to a tumbledown slab
hut with a stockyard beside it The yard had been mended and the rails
were up Seven or eight horses were inside all in good condition As
many men were sitting or standing about smoking outside the old hut

When we rode up they all came forward and we had it out We knew who was
coming and were ready for em There was Moran of course quiet and
savagelooking just as like a black snake as ever twisting about with
his deadly glittering eyes wanting to bite some one There was Daly
and Burke Wall and Hulbert and two or three moreI wont say who
they were nowand if you please who should come out of the hut last but
Master Billy the Boy as impudent as you like with a pipe in his mouth
and a revolver in his belt trying to copy Moran and Daly I felt sorry
when I see him and thought what hed gradually come to bit by bit and
where hed most likely end all along of the first money he had from
father for telegraphing But after all Ive a notion that men and women
grow up as they are intended to from the beginning All the same as a
tree from seed You may twist it this road or that make it a bit bigger
or smaller according to the soil or the way its pruned and cut down
when its young but you wont alter the nature of that tree or the
fruit that it bears You wont turn a fivecorner into a quince or a
geebung into an orange twist and twine and dig and water as you like
So whichever way Billy the Boy had been broken and named hed have
bolted and run off the course Take a pet dingo now He might look very
tame and follow them that feed him and stand the chain but as soon
as anything passed close that he could kill hed have his teeth into
it and be lapping its blood before you could say knife and the older he
got the worse hed be

Well Dick says this young limb of Satan so youve took to the
Queens highway agin as the chap says in the play I thought you and
Jim was agoing to jine the Methodies or the Sons of Temperance at
Turon you both got to look so thunderin square on it Poor old Jim
looks dreadful down in the mouth dont he though

It would be all the better for you if youd joined some other body you
young scamp I said Who told you to come here Ive half a mind to
belt you home again to your mother and I walked towards him

No you wont Dick Marston dont you make any mistake says the
young bullpup looking nasty Im as good a man as you with this
little tool Here he pulled out his revolver Ive as much right to
turn out as you have What odds is it to you what I do

I looked rather foolish at this and Moran and Burke began to laugh

Youd better set up a nightschool Dick says Burke and get Billy
and some of the other flash kiddies to come They might turn over a new
leaf in time

If youll stand up or Moran there thats grinning behind you Ill
make some of ye laugh on the wrong side I said

Come on drawls Moran taking off his coat and walking up Id like
to have a smack at you before you go into the Church

We should have been at it hammer and tongswe both hated one another
like poisononly the others interfered and Billy said we ought to be
ashamed of ourselves for quarrelling like schoolboys We were nice sort
of chaps to stick up a gold escort That made a laugh and we knocked
off

Well it looked as if no one wanted to speak Then Hulbert a very quiet
chap says I believe Ben Marstons the oldest man here lets hear
what hes got to say

Father gets up at once and looks steady at the rest of em takes his
pipe out of his mouth and shakes the baccy out Then he says

All on ye knows without my telling what weve come here about and what
theres hangin to it Its good enough if its done to rights but make
no mistake boys its a battle as must be fought game and right back
to the ropes or not at all If theres a bird here that wont stand the
steel hed better be put in a bag and took home again

Never mind about the steel daddy says one of the new men Were all
good for a flutter when the wagers good Whatll it be worth a man and
where are we going to divide We know your mobs got some crib up in the
mountains that no one knows about We dont want the swag took there and
planted It mightnt be found easy

Did ever a one of ye heer tell o me actin crooked says father
Look here Bill Im not as young as I was but you stand up to me for
three rounds and Ill take some of the cheek out of yer

Bill laughed

No fear daddy Id sooner face Dick or Jim But I only want whats
fair between man and man Its a big touch you know and we cant take
it to the bank to divide like diggers or summons yer either

Whats the good of growlin and snappin says Burke Were all goin
in regular I suppose share and share alike The men nodded Well
theres only one way to make things shipshape and thats to have a
captain Well pick one of ourselves and whatever he says well bind
ourselves to dolife or death Is that it boys

Yes yes thats the only way came from all hands

Now the next thing to work is who were to make captain of Theres
one here as we can all depend on who knows more about roadwork than
all the rest of us put together You know who I mean but I dont want
ye to choose him or any man because I tell you I propose Starlight for
captain if hell take it and them that dont believe me let em find a
better man if they can

I vote for Dan Moran says another man a youngish farmerlooking
chap Hes a bushman like ourselves and not a halfbred swell thats
just as likely to clear out when we want him most as do anything else

You go back to the Springs and feed them pigs Johnny says father
walking towards the young chap Thats about what YOURE bred for
nobodyll take you for a swell quarterbred or anything else
Howsoever lets draw lots for it Every man put his fancy down on a bit
of paper and put em into my old hat here

This was done after a bit and the end of it was ten votes for Starlight
and two or three for Moran who looked savage and sulkier than ever

When this was over Starlight walked over from where he was standing
near me and Jim and faced the crowd He drew himself up a bit and
looked round as haughty as he used to do when he walked up the big room
at the Prospectors Arms in Turonas if all the rest of us was dirt
under his feet

Well my lads he said youve done me the great honour to elect
me to be your captain Im willing to act or I shouldnt be here If
youre fools enough to risk your lives and liberties for a thousand
ounces of gold a man Im fool enough to show you the way

Hurrah said halfadozen of them flinging up their hats Were on
Captain Starlight for ever You ride ahead and well back up

That will do he says holding up his hand as if to stop a lot of dogs
barking but listen to me Here he spoke a few words in that other
voice of his that always sounded to me and Jim as if it was a different
man talking or the devil in his likeness Now mind this before we
go you dont quite know me you will by and by perhaps When I take
command of this gang for this bit of work or any other my words
lawdo you hear And if any man disputes it or disobeys my orders
by Ill shoot him like a dog

As he stood there looking down on the lot of em as if he was their
king with his eyes burning up at last with that slow fire that lay
at the bottom of em and only showed out sometimes I couldnt help
thinking of a pirate crew that Id read of when I was a boy and the way
the pirate captain ruled em




Chapter 34



We were desperate fidgety and anxious till the day came While we were
getting ready two or three things went wrong of course Jim got a
letter from Jeanie all the way from Melbourne where shed gone It
seems shed got her money from the bankJims share of the goldall
right She was a saving careful little woman and she told him shed
enough to keep them both well for four or five years anyhow What she
wanted him to do was to promise that hed never be mixed up in any more
dishonest work and to come away down to her at once

It was the easiest thing in the world she said to get away from
Melbourne to England or America Ships were going every day and glad
to take any man that was strong and willing to work his passage for
nothing theyd pay him besides

Shed met one or two friends down there as would do anything to help her
and him If he would only get down to Melbourne all would yet be well
but she begged and prayed him if he loved her and for the sake of the
life she hoped to live with him yet to come away from his companions
and take his own Jeanies advice and try and do nothing wrong for the
future

If Jim had got his letter before we made up matters just at the last
hed have chucked up the sponge and cleared out for good and all He as
good as said so but he was one of them kind of men that once hed
made a start never turned back Thered been some chaff to make things
worse between Moran and Daly and some of the other fellows about being
game and what not specially after what father said at the hut so he
wouldnt draw out of it now

I could see it fretted him worse than anything since we came back but
he filled himself up with the idea that wed be sure to get the gold
all right and clear out different ways to the coast and then wed have
something worth while leaving off with Another thing wed been all
used to having what money we wanted lately and we none of us fancied
living like poor men again in America or anywhere else We hadnt had
hardly a scrap from Aileen since wed come back this last time It
wasnt much odds She was regular brokenhearted you could see it in
every line

She had been foolish enough to hope for better things she said now
she expected nothing more in this world and was contented to wear
out her miserable life the best way she could If it wasnt that her
religion told her it was wrong and that mother depended on her shed
drown herself in the creek before the door She couldnt think why some
people were brought into this miserable world at all Our family had
been marked out to evil and the same fate would follow us to the end
She was sorry for Jim and believed if he had been let take his own road
that he would have been happy and prosperous today It was a pity he
could not have got away safely to Melbourne with his wife before that
wicked woman who deserved to be burnt alive ruined everything Even
now we might all escape the country seemed in so much confusion with
all the strangers and bad people bad peoplewell every one thinks
their own crow the blackest that the goldfields had brought into it
that it wouldnt be hard to get away in a ship somehow If nothing else
bad turned up perhaps it might come to pass yet

This was the only writing wed had from poor Aileen It began all misery
and bitterness but got a little better at the end If she and Gracey
could have got hold of Kate Morrison there wouldnt have been much left
of her in a quarter of an hour I could see that

Inside was a little bit of paper with one line For my sake that
was all I knew the writing there was no more I could see what Gracey
meant and wished over and over again that I had the chance of going
straight as Id wished a thousand times before but it was too late
too late When the coach is running down hill and the breaks off its
no use trying to turn We had all our plan laid out and settled to the
smallest thing We were to meet near Eugowra Rocks a good hour or two
before the escort passed so as to have everything ready I remember the
day as well as if it was yesterday We were all in great buckle and very
fit certainly I dont think I ever felt better in my life There must
be something outandout spiriting in a real battle when a bit of a
scrimmage like this sent our blood boiling through our veins made us
feel as if we werent plain Dick and Jim Marston but regular grand
fellows in a manner of speaking What fools men are when theyre
youngand sometimes after that itselfto be sure

We started at daylight and only stopped once on the road for a bite
for ourselves and to water the horses so that we were in good time We
brought a little corn with us just to give the horses something theyd
be tied up for hours and hours when we got to the place pitched on They
were all there before us they hadnt as good horses by a long chalk as
we had and two of their packers were poor enough Jim and I were riding
ahead with Starlight a little on the right of us When the fellows saw
Rainbow they all came crowding round him as if hed been a show

By George says Burke thats a horse worth calling a horse Captain
I often heard tell of him but never set eyes on him before Ive two
minds to shake him and leave you my horse and a share of the gold to
boot I never saw his equal in my life and Ive seen some plums too

Honour amongwellbushrangers eh Burke says Starlight cheerily
Hes the right sort isnt he We shall want good goers tonight Are
we all here now Wed better get to business

Yes they were all there a lot of wellbuilt upstanding chaps young
and strong and fit to do anything that a man could do in the way of
work or play It was a shame to see them there and us too for the
matter of that but there was no get away now There will be fools
and rogues to the end of the world I expect Even Moran looked a bit
brighter than he did last time He was one of those chaps that a bit of
real danger smartens up As for Burke Daly and Hulbert they were like
a lot of schoolboys so full of their fun and larks

Starlight just spoke a word to them all he didnt talk much but looked
hard and stern about the face as a captain ought to do He rode up to
the gap and saw where the trees had been cut down to block up the road
It would be hard work getting the coach through there nowfor a bit to
come

After that our horses and the two packers were left behind with Warrigal
and father close enough for hearing but well out of the way for
seeing it was behind a thick belt of timber They tied up some to
trees and shorthobbled others keeping them all so as to be ready at a
moments notice Our men hid themselves behind rocks and stumps on the
high side of the road so as they could see well and had all the shadow
on their side Wall and Hulbert and their lot had their mob of horses
packers and all planted away and two young fellows belonging to their
crowd minding them

Wed been ready a good bit when a cove comes tearing up full bat We
were watching to see how he shaped and whether he looked likely to lay
on the police when I saw it was Billy the Boy

Now I call this something like says he pulling up short army in
readiness the enemy not far off My word it is a fine thing to turn
out aint it Dick Do you chaps feel shaky at all Aint yer gallied
the least little bit Theyre acomin

How long will they be Starlight said Just remember that youre not
skylarking at a poundyard my boy

All right Captain he answered quiet enough I started on ahead the
moment I saw em leave the camp Theyre safe to be here in ten minutes
now You can see em when they come into the flat Ill clear out to the
back for a bit I want em to think I come up permiskuslike when its
over So the young rascal galloped away till the trees hid him and in
a quarter of an hour more we saw the leaders of the fourhorse drag that
carried the escort gold turn round on the forest road and show out into
the flat

It gave me a queer feeling just at first We hadnt been used to firing
on the Queens servants not in cold blood anyhow but it was them or
us for it now There was no time to think about it They came along at
a steady trot up the hill We knew the Turon sergeant of police that
drove a tall man with a big black beard down to his chest He had been
in an English dragoon regiment and could handle the ribbons above a
bit He had a trooper alongside him on the box with his rifle between
his knees Two more were in the body of the drag They had put their
rifles down and were talking and laughing not expecting anything
sudden Two more of the mounted men rode in front but not far The
couple behind were a good way off All of a sudden the men in front came
on the trees lying across the road They pulled up short and one of
them jumped down and looked to see if anything could be done to move
them The other man held his horse The coach drove up close so that
they were bunched up pretty well together

Who the devil has been doing that sung out the sergeant Just as
if the road isnt bad enough without these infernal lazy scoundrels of
bullockdrivers cutting down trees to make us go round Its a beastly
track here at the best of times

I believe them trees have been fallen on purpose says the trooper
that was down Theres been men and horses too about here today by
the tracks Theyre up to no good

Fire

The order was given in Starlights clear bold voice Just like a horn
it sounded You might have heard it twice as far off A dozen shots
followed the next second making as much row as fifty because of the way
the sound echoed among the rocks

I never saw a bigger surprise in my life and wasnt likely to do as
this was my first regular battle We had plenty of time to take aim and
just at first it looked as if the whole blessed lot of the police was
killed and wounded

The sergeant threw up his arms and fell off the box like a log just
under the horses feet One of the troopers on ahead dropped he that
was holding the horses and both horses started off at full gallop The
two men in the body of the drag were both hitone badly So when the
two troopers came up full gallop from the back they found us cutting
the traces of the team that was all plunging like mad and letting the
horses go

We opened fire at them directly they showed themselves of course they
couldnt do much in the face of a dozen men all well armed and behind
good cover They kept it up for a bit till one of their horses was hit
and then made tracks for Turon to report that the escort had been stuck
up by twenty or thirty men at Eugowra Rocksthe others had come up with
the packhorses by this time along with Master Billy the Boy firing
his revolver and shouting enough for halfadozen so we looked a big
crowdthat all the men were shot dead wounded or taken prisoners and
that a strong force had better be despatched at once to recapture the
gold

A good deal of this was true though not all The only man killed was
the sergeant He was shot clean through the heart and never stirred
again Of the five other men three were badly wounded and two slightly
We attended to them as well as we could and tied the others so that
they would not be able to give any bother for an hour or two at any
rate

Then the trouble began about dividing the gold We opened the sort of
locker there was in the centre of the coach and took out the square
boxes of gold They held canvas bags all labelled and weighed to the
grain of about 1000 oz each There were fourteen boxes in all Not a
bad haul

Some of the others couldnt read or write and they wouldnt trust us
so they brought their friend with them who was an educated man sure
enough We were a bit stunned to see him holding the sort of position
he did at the Turon But there he was and he did his work well enough
He brought a pair of scales with him and weighed the lot and portioned
it all out amongst us just the same as Mr Scott the banker used to
do for us at the Turon when we brought in our months washingup We had
5000 oz Starlight had an extra share on account of being captain and
the rest had somewhere about 8000 oz or 9000 oz among them It wasnt
so bad

Dad wasnt long before he had our lot safely packed and on his two
packhorses Warrigal and he cleared out at a trot and went out of
sight in a jiffy It was every man for himself now We waited a bit to
help them with their swag it was awful heavy We told them that their
packhorses would never carry it if there was anything of a close run
for it

Suppose you think youve got the only good horse in the country Dick
Marston says Daly Well find a horse to run anything youve got
barrin Rainbow Ive got a little roan horse here as shall run ever a
horse ye own for three mile for a hundred notes with twelve stone up
What do you think of that now

Dont take your shirt off Patsey I said I know the roans as good
as ever was foaled so he was the police got him after Patsey was done
for and kept him till he died of old age but hes in no condition
Im talking of the packhorses theyre not up to much as youll find
out

We didnt want to rush off at once for fear the other fellows might say
something afterwards if anything happened cross So we saw them make a
fair start for a spot on Weddin Mountain where they thought they
were right We didnt think we could be caught once we made tracks in
earnest After a couple or three hours riding we should be pretty safe
and daylight would see us at the Hollow

We stopped besides to do what we could for the wounded men They were
none of them regularly done for except the sergeant One man was shot
through the lungs and was breathing out blood every now and then We
gave them some brandy and water and covered them all up and left them
as comfortable as we could Besides that we sent Billy the Boy who
couldnt be recognised to the camp to have a doctor sent as soon as
possible Then we cleared and started off not the way we had to go but
so as we could turn into it

We couldnt ride very slow after such a turn as that so we made the
pace pretty hot for the first twenty miles or so By Jove it was a
great ride the forest was middling open and we went three parts speed
when we could see before us The horses seemed to go as if they knew
there was something up I can see Rainbow now swinging along with that
beautiful bounding style of going he had snorting now and then and
sending out his legs as if one hundred miles more or less was nothing
His head up his eye shining like a star his nostrils open and every
now and then if anything got up hed give a snort as if hed just come
up out of the bush Theyd had a longish day and a fast ride before they
got to Eugowra just enough to eat to keep them from starving with
a drink of water Now they were going the same style back and theyd
never had the saddles off their backs All the night through we rode
before we got to the top of Nulla Mountain very glad to see it we were
then We took it easy for a few miles now and again then wed push on
again We felt awful sleepy at times wed been up and at it since
the morning before long before daylight too The strangeness and the
chance of being followed kept us up else I believe wed have dropped
off our horses backs regular dead beat

We lost ground now and then through Warrigal not being there to guide
us but Jim took the lead and he wasnt far out besides the horses
knew which way to steer for their grass at the Hollow They wouldnt let
us go much off the line if it was ever so dark We gave em their heads
mostly The sun was just rising as we rode across the last tableland
We got off and stumbled along horses and men down the track to the
Hollow Dad and Warrigal hadnt come back of course they couldnt stand
the pace we did Theyd have to camp for a bit but they both knew of
plants and hiding holes where all the police in the colony couldnt
find them We knew theyd turn up some time next day So we let go our
horses and after a bit of supper laid down and slept till well on in
the afternoon

When I looked round I saw the dog sleeping at Jims feet old Crib He
never left father very far so of course the old man must be home or
pretty close up I was that dead beat and tired out that I turned over
and went to sleep for another couple of hours When I next woke up I was
right and felt rested so I put on my things had a good wash and went
out to speak to father He was sitting by the fire outside smoking just
as if hed never been away




Chapter 35



We done that job to rights if we never done another eh lad says
father reaching out for a coal to put in his pipe

Seems like it I said Therell be a deuce of a bobbery about it We
shant be able to move for a bit let alone clear out

Well show em a trick or two yet says dad I could see hed had a
tot early as it was I wonder how them chaps got on But well hear
soon

How shall we hear anything Nobodyll be mad enough to show out of here
for a bit

I could get word here says father if there was a police barrack on
the top of Nulla Mountain Ive done it afore and I can do it again

Well I hope it wont be long for Im pretty full up of this
stayingathome business in the Hollow Its well enough for a bit but
its awful slow when youve too much of it

It wouldnt be very slow if we was all grabbed and tried for our lives
Mr Dick Marston Would ye like that better for a change says the old
man showing his teeth like a dog thats making up his mind to have ye
and dont see where hes to get first bite You leave the thing to them
as knows more than you do or youll find yourself took in and that
precious sharp

Youll find your pals Burke and Moran and their lot will have their
turn first I said and with that I walked off for I saw the old man
had been drinking a bit after his nights work and that always started
his temper the wrong way There was no doing anything with him then
as I knew by long experience I was going to ask him where hed put the
gold but thought it best to leave that for some other time

By and by when we all turned out and had some breakfast we took a bit
of a walk by ourselves and talked it over We could hardly think it was
all done and over

The gold escort stuck up Fourteen thousand ounces of gold taken
Sergeant Hawkins shot dead The robbers safe off with their booty

This is the sort of thing that we were sure to see in all the papers It
would make a row and no mistake It was the first time such a thing had
been thought of much less carried out to rights as father said
in any of the colonies We had the five thousand ounces of gold safe
enough too That was something whether we should be let enjoy it or
what chance we had of getting right away out of the country was quite
another matter We were all sorry for Sergeant Hawkins and would have
been better pleased if hed been only wounded like the others But these
sorts of things couldnt be helped It was the fortune of war his luck
this time ours next We knew what we had to expect Nothing would make
much difference As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb We were up to
our necks in it now and must fight our way out the best way we could

Bar any man betraying the secret of the Hollow we might be safe for
years to come as long as we were not shot or taken in fair fight And
who was to let out the secret No one but ourselves had the least notion
of the track or where it led to or of such a place as the Hollow being
in the colony Only us five were in possession of the secret We never
let any of these other men come near much less to it We took good care
never to meet them within twenty miles of it Father was a man that
even when he was drunk never let out what he didnt want other people
to know Jim and I and Starlight were not likely to blab and Warrigal
would have had his throat cut sooner than let on about anything that
might be against Starlight or that he told him not to do

We had good reason then to think ourselves safe as long as we had such
a place to make for whenever we were in danger or had done a stroke
We had enough in gold and cash to keep us comfortable in any other
countryprovided we could only get there That was the rub When wed
got a glass or two in our heads we thought it was easy enough to get
across country or to make away one by one at shearing time disguised
as swagsmen to the coast But when we thought it over carefully in the
mornings particularly when we were a bit nervous after the grog had
died out of us it seemed a rather blue lookout

There was the whole countryside pretty thick with police stations
where every man from the sergeant to the lastjoined recruit knew
the height size colour of hair and so on of every one of us If a
suspiciouslooking man was seen or heard of within miles the telegraph
wires could be set to work He could be met stopped searched and
overhauled What chance would any of us have then

Dont flatter yourselves my boy Starlight said when wed got the
length of thinking how it was to be done that theres any little
bit of a chance for a year or two at any rate of getting away Not a
kangaroo rat could hop across from one scrub to another if there was
the least suspicion upon him without being blocked or run into Jim old
man Im sorry for you but my belief is were quartered here for a year
or two certain and the sooner we make up our minds to it the better

Here poor old Jim groaned Dont you think he said quite timidlike
that about shearingtime a man might take his chance leading an old
horse with a swag on as if he wanted to get shearing in some of the big
downtheriver sheds

Not a bit of it says Starlight Youre such a goodlooking
upstanding chap that youre safe to be pulled up and made answer for
yourself before youd get fifty miles If you rode a good horse theyd
think you were too smartlooking for a regular shearer and nail you at
once

But Id take an old screw with a big leg pleaded Jim Havent I
often seen a cove walking and leading one just to carry his blankets and
things

Then theyd know a chap like you full of work and a native to boot
ought to have a better turnoutif it wasnt a stall So theyd have
you for that

But theres Isaac Lawson and Campbelltown Youve seen them Isaacs an
inch taller than me and the same cut and make Why shouldnt they shop
them when theyre going shearing Theyre square enough and always was
And Campbelltowns a good deal like Dick beard and all

Well Ill bet you a new meerschaum that both men are arrested on
suspicion before shearing Of course theyll let them go again but
you mark my words theyll be stopped as well as dozens of others That
will show how close the search will be

I dont care says Jim in his old obstinate way which he never put
on except very seldom Ill go in a month or twopolice or no police
Ill make for Melbourne if there was an army of soldiers between me and
Jeanie

We had to settle where the gold was to be hid After a lot of talk we
agreed to keep one bag in a hole in the side of the wall of the cave
and bury the others in the place where wed found old Mr Devereuxs
box His treasure had laid many a year safe and sound without anybody
touching it and we thought ours might do the same Besides to find it
they must get into the Hollow first So we packed it out bag by bag and
made an ironbark coffin for it and buried it away there and put some
couchgrass turfs on it We knew theyd soon grow up and nobody could
tell that it hadnt always been covered up the same as the rest of the
old garden

It felt pretty hard lines to think we shouldnt be able to get away from
this lonely place after the life wed led the last year but Starlight
wasnt often wrong and we came to the same way of thinking ourselves
when we looked at it all round steady and quiet like

Wed been a week or ten days all by ourselves horsebreaking fishing
and shooting a bit thinking how strange it was that we should have more
than 20000 Pounds in gold and money and not be able to do anything with
it when dad sudden like said hed go out himself and get some of the
newspapers and perhaps a letter or two if any came

Starlight laughed at him a bit for being foolhardy and said we should
hear of his being caught and committed for trial Why theyll know
the dog says he and make him give evidence in court Ive known that
done before now Inspector Merlin nailed a chap through his dog

Father grinned I knowd that casea sheepstealing one They wanted
to make out Brummy was the man as owned the dorga remarkable dorg he
was too and had been seen driving the sheep

Well what did the dog do Identify the prisoner didnt he

Well the dashed fool of a coolie did Jumps up as soon as he was
brought into court and whines and scratches at the dock rails and
barks and goes on tremenjus trying to get at Brummy

How did his master like it

Oh Brummy He looked as black as the ace of spades Hed have made it
hot for that dorg if he could ha got at him But I suppose he forgived
him when he came out

Why should he

Because the jury fetched him in guilty without leaving the box and the
judge give him seven years You wouldnt find this old varmint adoin
no such foolishness as that

Here he looks at Crib as was lyin down a good way off and not letting
on to know anything He saw fathers old mare brought up though and
saddled and knowed quite well what that meant He never rode her unless
he was going out of the Hollow

I believe that dog could stick up a man himself as well as some fellows
we know says Starlight and hed do it too if your father gave him
the word

     

While we were taking it easy and except for the loneliness of it as
safe as if we had been out of the country altogether Moran and the
other fellows hadnt quite such a good time of it They were hunted from
pillar to post by the police who were mad to do something to meet
the chaff that was always being cast up to them of having a lot of
bushrangers robbing and shooting all over the country and not being
able to take them There were some outoftheway places enough in the
Weddin Mountains but none like the Hollow where they could lie quiet
and untroubled for weeks together if they wanted Besides they
had lost their gold by their own foolishness in not having better
packhorses and hadnt much to carry on with and its not a life that
can be worked on the cheap I can tell you as we often found out Money
comes easy in our line but it goes faster still and a man must never
be short of a pound or two to chuck about if he wants to keep his
information fresh and to have people working for him night and day with
a will

So they had some everyday sort of work cut out to keep themselves
going and it took them all their time to get from one part of the
country where they were known to some other place where they werent
expected Having outandout good hacks and being all of them chaps
that had been born in the bush and knew it like a book it was wonderful
how they managed to rob people at one place one day and then be at some
place a hundred miles off the next Ever so many times they came off
and theyd call one another Starlight and Marston and so on till the
people got regularly dumbfoundered and couldnt tell which of the gang
it was that seemed to be all over the country and in two places at the
same time We used to laugh ourselves sometimes when wed hear tell
that all the travellers passing Big Hill on a certain day were stuck up
by Walls gang and robbed Every man Jack that came along for hours
was made to stand behind a clump of trees with two of the gang guarding
them so as the others couldnt see them as they came up They all had
to deliver up what theyd got about em and no one was allowed to stir
till sundown for fear they should send word to the police Then the
gang went off telling them to stay where they were for an hour or else
theyd come back and shoot them

This would be on the western road perhaps Next day a station on the
southern road a hundred and twenty miles off would be robbed by the
same lot Money and valuables taken away and three or four of the best
horses Their own theyd leave behind in such a state that any one could
see how far and fast theyd been ridden

They often got stood to when they were hard up for a mount and it was
this way The squatters werent alike by any manner of means in their
way of dealing with them Many of them had lots of fine ridinghorses
in their paddocks These would be yarded some fine night the best taken
and ridden hard perhaps returned next morning perhaps in a day or two

It was pretty well known who had used them but nothing was said the
best policy some think is to hold a candle to the devil especially
when the devils camped close handy to your paddock and might any time
sack your house burn down your woolshed and stacks or even shoot at
your worshipful self if he didnt like the way you treated him and his
imps

These careful respectable people didnt show themselves too forward
either in giving help or information to the police Not by no means
They never encouraged them to stay when they came about the place and
werent that over liberal in feeding their horses or giving them a hand
in any way that theyd come again in a hurry If they were asked about
the bushrangers or when theyd been last seen they were very careful
and said as little as possible

No one wonders at people like the Barness or little farmers or the
very small sort of settlers people with one flock of sheep or a few
cows doing this sort of thing they have a lot to lose and nothing
to get if they gain illwill But regular country gentlemen with big
properties lots of money and all the rest of it theyre there to
show a good example to the countryside whether it paid for the time or
whether it didnt and all us sort of chaps on the cross or not like
them all the better for it

When I say all of us I dont mean Moran A sulky blackhearted
revengeful brute he always wasI dont think hed any manly feeling
about him He was a halfbred gipsy they told us that knew where he was
reared and Starlight said gipsy blood was a queer cross for devilry
and hardness it couldnt be beat he didnt wonder a bit at Morans
being the scoundrel he was

No doubt he had it in for more than one of the people who helped the
police to chevy Wall and his lot about From what I knew of him I was
sure hed do some mischief one of these days and make all the country
ten times as hot against us as they were now He had no mercy about him
Hed rather shoot a man any day than not and hed burn a house down
just for the pleasure of seeing how the owner looked when it was
lighted

Starlight used to say he despised men that tried to save themselves
cowardlylike more than he could say and thought them worse than the
bushrangers themselves Some of them were big people too

But other country gentlemen like Mr Falkland were quite of a
different pattern If they all acted like him I dont think we should
any of us have reigned as long as we did They helped and encouraged the
police in every possible way They sent them information whenever they
had received any worth while They lent them horses freely when their
own were tired out and beaten More than that when bushrangers were
supposed to be in the neighbourhood they went out with them themselves
lying out and watching through the long cold nights and taking their
chance of a shot as well as those that were paid for it

Now there was a Mr Whitman that had never let go a chance from the
start of running their trail with the police and had more than once
given them all they knew to get away He was a native of the country
like themselves a firstclass horseman and tracker a hardy game sort
of a chap that thought nothing of being twentyfour hours in the saddle
or sitting under a fence watching for the whole of a frosty night

Well he was pretty close to Moran once who had been out by himself
that close he ran him he made him drop his rifle and ride for his life
Moran never forgave him for this and one day when they had all been
drinking pretty heavy he managed to persuade Wall Hulbert Burke and
Daly to come with him and stick up Whitmans house

I sent word to him Id pay him out one of these fine days he drawled
out and hell find that Dan Moran can keep his word

He picked a time when he knew Whitman was away at another station I
always thought Moran was not so game as he gave himself out to be And
I think if hed had Whitmans steady eyes looking at him and seeing a
pistol in his hand he wouldnt have shot as straight as he generally
did when he was practising at a gum tree

Anyhow they laid it out all right as they thought to take the place
unawares Theyd been drinking at a flash kind of inn no great way off
and when they rode up to the house it seems they were all of em
three sheets in the wind and fit for any kind of villainy that came
uppermost As for Moran he was a devil unchained I know what he was
The people in the house that day trembled and shook when they heard the
dogs bark and saw five strange horsemen ride through the back gate into
the yard

Theyd have trembled a deal more if theyd known what was coming




Chapter 36



When we found that by making darts and playing hide and seek with the
police in this way we could ride about the country more comfortable
like we took matters easier Once or twice we tried it on by night and
had a bit of a lark at Jonathans which was a change after having to
keep dark so long Wed rode up there after dark one night and made
ourselves pretty snug for the evening when Bella Barnes asked us if
wed dropped across Moran and his mob that day

No says I Didnt know they were about this part Why werent they
at Moncktons the day before yesterday

Ah but they came back last night passed the house today going
towards Mr Whitmans at Darjallook I dont know but I expect theyre
going to play up a bit there because of his following them up that time
the police nearly got Moran

What makes you think that Theyre only going for what they can get
perhaps the ridinghorses and any loose cash thats knocking about

Billy the Boy was here for a bit says Maddie I dont like that
young brat hell turn out bad you take my word for it but he said
Moran knew Mr Whitman was away at the Castlereagh station and was
going to make it a warning to them all

Well its too bad said Bella theres no one there but Mrs Whitman
and the young ladies Its real cowardly I call it to frighten a
parcel of women But that Morans a brute and hasnt the feelings of a
man about him

We must ride over boys says Starlight yawning and stretching
himself I was looking forward to a pleasant evening here but it seems
to me we ought to have a say in this matter Whitmans gone a trifle
fast and been hard on us but hes a gentleman and goes straight for
what he considers his duty I dont blame him If these fellows are half
drunk theyll burn the place down I shouldnt wonder and play hells
delight

And Miss Falklands up there too staying with the young ladies
says Maddie Why Jim whats up with you I thought you wasnt taking
notice

Come along Dick says Jim quite hoarselike making one jump to
the door Dash it man whats the use of us wasting time jawing here
By if theres a hair of her head touched Ill break Morans neck
and shoot the lot of them down like crows

Goodbye girls I said theres no time to lose

Starlight made a bow polite to the last and passed out Jim was on his
horse as we got to the stable door Warrigal fetched Starlights and
in half a minute Jim and he were off together along the road full split
and I had as much as I could do to catch them up within the next mile
It wasnt twenty miles to Whitmans place Darjallook but the road was
good and we did it in an hour and twenty minutes or thereabouts I
know Starlight lit a match and looked at his watch when we got near the
front gate

We could see nothing particular about the house The lights shone out of
the windows and we heard the piano going

Seems all right says Starlight Wonder if they came after all
Theyll think we want to stick the place up if we ride up to the hall
door Get off and look out tracks Warrigal

Warrigal dismounted lit a couple of matches and put his head down
close to the soft turf as if he was going to smell it

Where track says Starlight

There says Warrigal pointing to something we couldnt see if wed
looked for a month Bin gone that way That one track Morans horse I
know him turn foot in likit cow Four more track follow up

Why theyre in the house now the infernal scoundrels says
Starlight You stay here with the horses Warrigal well walk up If
you hear shooting tie them to the fence and run in

We walked up very quiet to the housewed all been there before and
knew where the front parlour wasover the lawn and two flowerbeds and
then up to the big bowwindow The others stood under an old white
cedar tree that shadowed all round I looked in and by George my face
burned cold as it was There was Moran lying back in an armchair with
a glass of grog in his hand takin it easy and makin himself quite at
home Burke and Daly were sitting in two chairs near the table looking
a long way from comfortable but they had a couple of bottles of brandy
on the table and glasses and were filling up So was Moran Theyd had
quite as much as was good for them The eldest Miss Whitman was
sitting at the piano playing away tune after tune while her eyes were
wandering about and her lips trembling and every now and then shed
flush up all over her face then shed turn as white as a sheet and
look as if shed fall off the stool The youngest daughter was on her
knees by her on the other side with her head in her lap Every now and
then I could hear a sob come from her but stifledlike as if she tried
to choke it back as much as she could

Burke and Daly had their pistols on the table among the bottlesthough
what they wanted em there for I couldnt seeand Moran had stuck his
on the back of the piano That showed me he was close up drunk for he
was a man as never hardly let go of his revolver

Mrs Whitman was sitting crouched up in a chair behind her daughter
with a stony face looking as if the end of the world was come I hardly
knew her again She was a very kind woman too many a glass of grog
shed given me at shearing time and medicine too once I was sick there
with influenza

But Miss Falkland I couldnt keep my eyes off her She was sitting on
the sofa against the wall quite upright with her hands before her
and her eyes looking half proudly half miserable round the room You
couldnt hardly tell she was frightened except by a kind of twitching of
her neck and shoulders

Presently Moran who was more than half boozed as it was and kept on
drinking calls out to Miss Whitman to sing a song

Come Miss Polly says he you can sing away fast enough for your
dashed old father and some o them swells from Bathurst By George you
must tune your pipe a bit this time for Dan Moran

The poor girl said she couldnt sing just then but shed play as much
as he liked

Yerd better sing now he drawls out unless ye want me to come and
make you I know you girls wants coaxing sometimes

Poor Miss Mary breaks out at once into some kind of a songthe
pitifullest music ever you listened to Only I wanted to wait a bit
so as to come in right once for all Id have gone at him hammer and
tongs that very minute

All this time Burke and Daly were goin in steady at the brandy
finished one bottle and tackled another They began to get noisy and
talked a lot and sung a kind of a chorus to Miss Marys song

After the song was over Moran swore hed have another one Shed never
sing for him any more he said unless she took a fancy to him and went
back to the Weddin Mountains with them

It aint a bad name for a mountain is it miss says he grinning
Then fixing his black snakes eyes on her he poured out about half a
tumbler of brandy and drank it off

By gum he says I must have a dance blest if I dont First chop
musicgood room thisthree gals and the missuscourse we must Im
regular shook on the polka You play us a good un Polly or whatever
yer name is Dan Morans goin to enjoy himself this night if he never
sees another Come on Burke Patsey stand up yer blamed fool Here
goes for my partner

Come Moran says Burke none of your larks were very jolly and
the young ladies aint on for a hop are ye miss and he looked over
at the youngest Miss Whitman who stared at him for a moment and then
hid her face in her hands

Are you agoin to play as I told yer says Moran Dye think yer
know when yer well off

The tone of voice he said this in and the look seemed to frighten the
poor girl so that she started an oldstyle polka there and then which
made him bang his heels on the floor and spin round as if hed been at
a dancehouse As soon as hed done two or three turns he walks over to
the sofa and sits down close to Miss Falkland and put his arm round her
waist

Come Fanny Falkland says he or whatever they call yer youre so
dashed proud yer wont speak to a bush cove at all You can go home byn
by and tell your father that you had a twirlround with Dan Moran
and helped to make the evening pass pleasant at Darjallook afore it was
burned

Anything like the disgust misery and rage mixed up that came into Miss
Falklands face all in a moment and togetherlike I never saw She made
no sound but her face grew paler and paler she turned white to the
lips as trembled and worked in spite of her She struggled fierce
and wild for nigh a solid minute to clear herself from him while her
beautiful eyes moved about like Ive seen a wild animals caught in a
trap Then when she felt her strength wasnt no account against his
she gave one piercing terrible scream so long and unnaturallike in
the tone of it that it curdled my very blood

I lifted up the windowsash quick and jumped in but before I made two
steps Jim sprang past me and raised his pistol

Drop her he shouts to Moran you hound Leave go Miss Falkland or
by the living God Ill blow your head off Dan Moran before you can
lift your hand How dare you touch her you cowardly dog

Moran was that stunned at seeing us show up so sudden that he was a good
bit took off his guard cool card as he was in a general way Besides
hed left his revolver on the piano close by the armchair where his
grog was Burke and Daly were no better off They found Starlight and
Warrigal covering them with their pistols so that theyd have been shot
down before they could so much as reach for their tools

But Jim couldnt wait and just as Moran was rising on his feet feeling
for the revolver that wasnt in his belt and that I never heard of
his being without but that once he jumps at him like a wallaroo and
catching him by the collar and waistbelt lifts him clean off his feet
as if hed been a child and brings him agen the corner of the wall with
all his full strength I thought his brains was knocked out dashed if
I didnt I heard Morans head sound against the stone wall with a dull
sort of thud and on the floor he drops like a dead mannever made a
kick By George we all thought he had killed him

Stash that now says Burke dont touch him again Jim Marston Hes
got as much as ll do him for a bit and I dont say it dont serve him
right I dont hold with being rough to women It aint manly and weve
got wives and kids of our own

Then why the devil didnt you stop it says Starlight You deserve
the same sauce you and Daly for sitting there like a couple of
children and letting that ruffian torment these helpless ladies If you
fellows go on sticking up on your own account and I hear a whisper of
your behaving yourselves like brutes Ill turn policeman myself for the
pleasure of running you in Now mind that you and Daly too Wheres
Wall and Hulbert

They went to yard the horses

Thats fair game and all in the days work I dont care what you take
or whom you shoot for that matter as long as its all in fair fight
but Ill have none of this sort of work if Im to be captain and youre
all sworn to obey me mind that Ill have to shoot a man yet I see as
Ive done before now before I can get attended to That brutes coming
to Lift him up and clear out of this place as soon as you can Ill
wait behind

They blundered out taking Moran with them who seemed quite stupid
like and staggered as he walked He wasnt himself for a week after
and longer too and threatened a bit but he soon saw hed no show as
all the fellows even to his own mates told him he deserved all he got

Old Jim stood up by the fireplace after that never stirring nor
speaking with his eyes fixed on Miss Falkland who had got back her
colour and though she panted a bit and looked raised like she wasnt
much different from what wed seen her before at the old place The two
Misses Whitman poor girls were standing up with their arms round one
anothers necks and the tears running down their faces like rain Mrs
Whitman was lying back in her chair with her hands over her face cryin
to herself quiet and easy and wringing her hands

Then Starlight moved forward and bowed to the ladies as if he was just
coming into a ballroom like I saw him once at a swell ball they gave
for the hospital at Turon

Permit me to apologise Mrs Whitman and to you my dear young ladies
for the rudeness of one of my men whom I unhappily was not able to
restrain I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr Whitman and I hope you
will express my regret that I was not in time to save you from the great
annoyance to which you have been subjected

Oh I shall be grateful all my life to you and so Im sure will Mr
Whitman when he returns and oh Sir Ferdinand if you and these two
good young men who I suppose are policemen in plain clothes had not
come in goodness only knows what would have become of us

I am afraid you are labouring under some mistake my dear madam I have
not the honour to be Sir Ferdinand Morringer or any other baronet at
present but I assure you I feel the compliment intensely I am sure my
good friends here James and Richard Marston do equally

Here the Misses Whitman in spite of all their terror and anxiety
were so tickled by the idea of their mother mistaking Starlight and the
Marstons for Sir Ferdinand and his troopers that they began to laugh
not but what they were sober enough in another minute

Miss Falkland got up then and walked forward looking just the way her
father used to do She spoke to Starlight first

I have never seen you before but I have often heard of you Captain
Starlight if you will allow me to address you by that title Believe
me when I say that by your conduct tonight you have won our deepest
gratitudemore than that our respect and regard Whatever may be your
future career whatever the fate that your wild life may end in always
believe there are those who will think of you pray for you rejoice
in your escapes and sorrow sincerely for your doom I can answer for
myself and I am sure for my cousins also

Here the Misses Whitman said

Yes indeed we willto our lifes end

Then she turned to Jim who still stood there looking at her with his
big gray eyes that had got ever so much darker lately

You poor old Jim she said and she took hold of his brown hand and
held it in her own I am more sorry than I can tell to hear all I have
done about you and Dick too This is the second time you have saved me
and I am not the girl to forget it if I could only show my gratitude
Is there any way

Theres Jeanie just them two words he said

Your wife Oh yes I heard about her looking at him so kind and
gentlelike I saw it all in the papers Shes in Melbourne isnt she
What is her address

Esplanade Hotel St Kilda says Jim taking a small bit of a letter
out of his pocket

Very well Jim I have a friend who lives near it She will find her
out and do all for her that can be done But why dont youwhy dont
all of you contrive to get away somehow from this hateful life and not
bring ruin and destruction on the heads of all who love you Say you
will try for their sakefor my sake

Its too late Miss Falkland I said Were all thankful to you for
the way youve spoken Jim and I would be proud to shed our blood for
you any time or Mr Falkland either Well do what we can but well
have to fight it out to the end now and take our chance of the bullet
coming before the rope Goodnight Miss Falkland and good luck to you
always

She shook hands heartily with me and Jim but when she came to Starlight
he raised her hand quite respectful like and just touched it with his
lips Then he bowed low to them all and walked slowly out

When we got to the publichouse which wasnt far off we found that
Moran and the other two had stayed there a bit till Wall and Hulbert
came then they had a drink all round and rode away The publican said
Moran was in an awful temper and he was afraid hed have shot somebody
before the others got him started and clear of the place

Its a mercy you went over Captain says he thered have been the
devil to pay else He swore hed burn the place down before he went from
here

Hell get caught one of these fine days says Starlight Theres more
risk at one station than halfadozen road scrimmages and that hell
find clever as he thinks himself

Wheres Mr Whitman Jack says I to the landlord he wasnt a bad
sort old Jack Jones What made him leave his place to the mercy of
the world in a manner of speaking

Well it was this way He heard that all the shepherds at the lower
station had cut it to the diggings ye see so he thought hed make a
dart up to the Castlereagh and riglate the place a bit Hell be back
afore morning

How dye know that

Well hes ridin that famous roan pony o his and he always comes
back from the station in one day though he takes two to go eightyfive
miles every yard of it Its a big day but that ponys a rum un and
can jump his own height easy Hell be welcome home tonight

I daresay he will and no wonder The missus must ha been awful
frightened and the young ladies too Goodnight Jack and we rattled
off

It wasnt so very late after all when we got back to Jonathans so as
the horses wanted a bit of a rest and a feed we roused up the girls and
had supper A very jolly one it was my word

They were full of curiosity you bet to know how we got on when they
heard Moran was there and the others So bit by bit they picked it out
of us When they heard it all Maddie got up and threw her arms round
Jims neck

I may kiss you now youre married she says and I know theres only
one woman in the world for you but you deserve one from every woman in
the country for smashing that wretch Moran Its a pity you didnt break
his neck Never mind old man Miss Falkland wont forget you for that
you take my word Im proud of you that I am

Jim just sat there and let her talk to him He smiled in a serious kind
of way when she ran over to him first but instead of a goodlooking
girl it might have been his grandmother for all he seemed to care

Youre a regular old image Jim says she I hope none of my other
friends ll get married if it knocks all the go out of them same as
it has from you However you can stand up for a friend cant you You
wouldnt see me trod upon dye think you would now Id stand up for
you I know if you was bested anywhere

My dear Maddie says Starlight James is in that particular stage of
infatuation when a man only sees one woman in the whole world I envy
him I assure you When your day comes you will understand much of what
puzzles you at present

I suppose so said Maddie going back to her seat with a wondering
queer kind of look But it must be dreadful dull being shut in for
weeks and weeks in one place perhaps and with only one man

I have heard it asserted he says that a slight flavour of monotony
occasionally assails the honeymoon Variety is the salt of life I begin
to think Some of these fine days Maddie well both get married and
compare notes

Youll have to look out then says Bella All the girls about here
are getting snapped up quick Theres such a lot of young bankers
Government officers and swells of all sorts about the diggings now not
to reckon the goldenhole men that we girls have double the pull we
had before the gold Why there was my old schoolmate Clara Mason
was married last week to such a fine young chap a surveyor Shed only
known him six weeks

Well Ill come and dance at your wedding if youll send me an invite
says Starlight

Will you though she said Wouldnt it be fun Unless Sir Ferdinand
was there Hes a great friend of mine you know

Ill come if his Satanic Majesty himself was present he occasionally
does attend a wedding Ive heard and bring you a present too Bella
mind its a bargain

Theres my hand on it says she I wonder how youll manage it but
Ill leave that to you It mightnt be so long either And now its time
for us all to go to bed Jims asleep I believe this half hour




Chapter 37



This bit of a barney of course made bad blood betwixt us and Morans
mob so for a spell Starlight and father thought it handier for us to
go our own road and let them go theirs We never could agree with chaps
like them and that was the long and short of it They were a deal too
rough and ready for Starlight and as for Jim and me though we were
none too good we couldnt do some of the things these coves was up to
nor stand by and see em done which was more This time we made up our
mind to go back to the Hollow and drop out of notice altogether for a
bit and take a rest like

We hadnt heard anything of Aileen and the old mother for weeks and
weeks so we fixed it that we should sneak over to Rocky Flat one at a
time and see how things were going and hearten em up a bit When
we did get to the Hollow instead of being able to take it easy as we
expected we found things had gone wrong as far as the devil could send
em that way if he tried his best It seems father had taken a restless
fit himself and after we were gone had crossed Nulla Mountain to some
place above Rocky Flat to where he could see what went on with a strong
glass

Before I go further I might as well tell you that along with the
whacking big reward that was offered for all of us a good many coves as
fancied themselves a bit had turned amateur policemen and had all kinds
of plans and dodges for catching us dead or alive Now men that take
to the bush like us dont mind the regular paid force much or bear them
any malice Its their duty to catch us or shoot us if we bolt and ours
to take all sorts of good care that they shant do either if we can help
it

Well as I was sayin we dont have it in for the regulars in the
police its all fair pulling pull devil pull baker some one has
to get the worst of it Now its us now its them that gets took or
rubbed out and no more about it

But what us cross coves cant stand and are mostly sure to turn nasty
on is the notion of fellows going into the manhunting trade with us for
game either for the fun of it or for the reward That reward means the
money paid for our blood WE DONT LIKE IT It may seem curious but we
dont and them as take up the line as a game to make money or fun out
of when theyve no call to find out their mistake sometimes when its
a deal too late

Now wed heard that a party of four mensome of them had been gaol
warders and some hadnthad made it up to follow us up and get us one
way or the other if it was to be done They werent in the police but
they thought they knew quite as much as the police did and besides
the reward 5000 Pounds if they got our lot and any one of the others
was no foolish money

Well nothing would knock it out of these chaps heads but that we were
safe to be grabbed in the long run trying to make into the old home
This was what made them gammon to be surveyors when they first came
as we heard about and go measuring and tapelining about when there
wasnt a child over eight years old on the whole creek that couldnt
have told with half an eye they wasnt nothing of the sort

Well as bad luck would have it just as father was getting down towards
the place he meets Moran and Daly who were making over to the Fish
River on a cattleduffing lay of their own They were pretty hard up
and Moran after his rough and tumble with Jim in which he had come off
second best was ready for anythinganything that was bad that is

After hed a long yarn with them about cattle and horses and what not
he offered them a tenpound note each if theyd do what he told them
Dad always carried money about with him he said it came in handy If
the police didnt take him they wouldnt get it and if they did take
him why nothing would matter much and it might go with the rest It
came in handy enough this time anyhow though it helped what had been
far better left undone

I remember what a blinded rage father got into when he first had
Aileens letter and heard that these men were camped close to the old
house poking about there all day long and worrying and frightening
poor Aileen and mother

Well it seems on this particular day theyd been into the little
township and I suppose got an extra glass of grog Anyhow when they
came back they began to be more venturesome than they generally were
One chap came into the house and began talking to Aileen and after a
bit mother goes into her bedroom and Aileen comes out into the verandah
and begins to wash some clothes in a tub splashing the water pretty
well about and making it a bit uncomfortable for any one to come near
her

What must this fool do but begin to talk about what white arms shed
gotnot that they were like that much shed done too much hard work
lately to have her arms or hands either look very grand and at last
he began to be saucy telling her as no Marston girl ought to think so
much of herself considerin who and what she was Well the end of it
was father heard a scream and he looked out from where he was hidden
and saw Aileen running down the garden and the fellow after her He
jumps out and fires his revolver slapbang at the chap it didnt hit
him but it went that close that he stopped dead and turned round to see
who it was

Ben Marston by all thats lucky boys says he as two of the other
chaps came running down at the shot Weve got the ould sarpint out of
his hole at last With that they all fires at father as quick as they
could draw and Aileen gives one scream and starts running along the
track up the hill that leads to George Storefields place

Father drops one of the bullets had hit him but not so bad as he
couldnt run so he ups again and starts running along the gully with
the whole four of them shouting and swearin after him making sure they
got him to rights this time

Two hundred a man boys the big fellow in the lead says and maybe
well take tay with the rest of em now

They didnt know the man they were after or theyd have just as soon
have gone to take tea as they called it with a tiger

Father put on one of his old poacher dodges that he had borrowed from
the lapwing in his own country that he used to tell us about when we
were boys our wild duck ll do just the same and made himself out a
deal worse than he was Father could run a bit too hed been fast for
a mile when he was young and though he was old now he never carried
no flesh to signify and was as hard as nails So what with knowing
the ground and they being flatcountry men he kept just out of
pistolshot and yet showed enough to keep em filled up with the notion
that theyd run him down after a bit

They fired a shot every now and then thinking a chance one might wing
him but this only let Moran and Daly see that some one was after dad
and that the hunt was coming their way

They held steady where they had been told to stop and looked out for
the men theyd been warned of by father As he got near this place he
kept lettin em git a bit nearer and nearer to him so as theyd follow
him up just where he wanted It gave them more chance of hitting him
but he didnt care about that now his blood was upnot he All he
wanted was to get them Dad was the coolest old cove when shooting
was going on ever I see Youd think he minded bullets no more than
bottlecorks

Well he goes stumbling and dragging himself like up the gully and
they cocksure of getting him closing up and shooting quicker and
quicker when just as he jumps down the Black Gully steps a bullet did
hit him in the shoulder under the right arm and staggers him in good
earnest Hed just time to cut down the bank and turn to the left along
the creek channel throwing himself down on his face among the bushes
when the whole four of em jumps down the bank after him

Stand says Moran and they looked up and saw him and Daly covering
them with their revolvers Before theyd time to draw two of em rolls
over as dead as doornails

The other two were dumbfoundered and knocked all of a heap by suddenly
finding themselves face to face with the very men theyd been hunting
after for weeks and weeks They held up their pistols but they didnt
seem to have much notion of using themparticularly when they found
father had rounded on em too and was standing a bit away on the side
looking very ugly and with his revolver held straight at em

Give in Put down your irons says Moran or by well drop ye
where ye stand

Come on says one and I think he intended to make a fight for it

Hed a been better off if he had It couldnt have been worse for him
but the other one didnt see a chance and so he says

Give in whats the good Theres three to two

All right says the other chap the big one and they put down their
pistols

It was curious now as these two were both men that father and Moran had
a down on Theyd better have fought it out as long as they could stand
up Theres no good got by givin in that I ever seen Men as does so
always drop in for it worse in the end

First thing then they tied em with their hands behind em and let
em stand up near their mates that were downdead enough both of them
one shot through the heart and one through the head

Then Moran sits down and has a smoke and looks over at em

You dont remember me Mr Hagan says he in his drawling way

No says the poor chap I dont think I do

But I remember you devilish well says Moran and so youll find
afore we leave this Then he took another smoke Werent you warder in
Berrima Gaol says he about seven year ago Ah now were coming to
it You dont remember getting Daniel Morana prisoner serving a long
sentence thereseven days solitary on bread and water for what you
called disobedience of orders and insolence

Yes I do remember now Id forgotten your face I was only doing my
duty and I hope you wont bear any malice

It was a little thing to you maybe says Moran but if youd had to
do seven long days and long cold nights in that devils den youd a
thought more about it But you will now My turns come

I didnt do it to you more than to the rest I had to keep order in the
gaol and devilish hard work it was

Youre a liar says Moran striking him across the face with his
clenched hand You had a down on me because I wouldnt knuckle down
to you like some of them and so you dropped it on to me every turn you
could get I was a youngster then and might have grown into a man if
Id been let But fellows like you are enough to turn any man into a
devil if theyve got him in their power

Well Im in your power now says he Lets see how youll shape

I dont like ye any the worse for being cheeky says Moran and
standing up to me but its too late The last punishment I got when
I was kept in irons night and day for a month because Id tried to get
out I swore Id have your life if ever I came across ye

Youll never shoot me in cold blood says the poor devil beginning to
look blue about the lips

I dont know what old Bens going to do with the man he found chevying
his daughter says Moran looking at him with his deadly blacksnake
eyes but Im agoin to shoot you as soon as Ive smoked out this
pipe so dont you make any mistake

I dont mind a shot or two says Daly but Im dashed if I can stand
by and see men killed in cold blood You coves have your own reasons I
suppose but I shall hook it over to the Fish River You know where to
find me And he walked away to where the horses were and rode off

     

We got fresh horses and rode over quick to Rocky Flat We took Warrigal
with us and followed our old track across Nulla Mountain till we got
within a couple of miles of the place Warrigal picked up the old mares
tracks so we knew father had made over that way and there was no call
for us to lose time running his trail any longer Better go straight on
to the house and find out what had happened there We sent Warrigal on
ahead and waited with our horses in our hands till he come back to us

In about an hour he comes tearing back with his eyes staring out of his
head

I bin see old missis he says She yabber that one makebelieve
constable bin there Gammonlike it surveyor and bimeby old man Ben
gon alonga hut and that one pleeceman fire at him and all about and
him break back alonga gully

Any of em come back says Jim

Bale me see um tentdog tied up Cake alonga fireplace all burn
to pieces No come home last night I blieve shot em old man longa
gully

Come along boys says Starlight jumping into his saddle The old
man might have been hit We must run the tracks and see whats come of
the governor Four to ones big odds

We skirted the hut and kept out wide till Warrigal cut the tracks which
he did easy enough We couldnt see a blessed thing Warrigal rode along
with his head down reading every tuft of grass every little stone
turned up every foot of sand like a book

Your old fader run likit Black Gully Two fellow track herebullet
longa this one tree Here he pointed to a scratch on the side of a box
tree in which the rough bark had been shivered Bimeby two fellow more
come nother one bullet nother one here too This one blood drop
longa white leaf

Here he picked up a dried gum leaf which had on the upper side a dark
red spot slightly irregular

We had it all now We came to a place where two horses had been tied to
a tree They had been stamping and pawing as if they had been there a
goodish while and had time to get pretty sick of it

That near side one Morans horse pigeontoes me know em says
Warrigal Off side one Dalys roan horse new shoes on You see um
hair rub himself longa tree

What the blazes were they doing hereabouts says Starlight This
begins to look complicated Whatever the row was Daly and he were in
it Theres no one rich enough to rob hereabouts is there I dont like
the look of it Ride on boys

We said nothing to each other but rode along as fast as Warrigal could
follow the line The sky which was bright enough when we started
clouded over and in less than ten minutes the wind rose and rain began
to pour down in buckets with no end of thunder and lightning Then it
got that cold we could hardly sit on our horses for trembling The sky
grew blacker and blacker The wind began to whistle and cry till I could
almost swear I heard some one singing out for help Nulla Mountain was
as black as your hat and a kind of curious feeling crept over me I
hardly knew why as if something was going to happen I didnt know
what

I fully expected to find father dead and though he wasnt altogether
a good father to us we both felt bad at the notion of his lyin there
cold and stiff I began to think of him as he used to be when we were
boys and when he wasnt so out and out hardand had a kind word for
poor mother and a kiss for little Aileen

But if he were shot or taken why hadnt these other men come back We
had just ridden by their tents and they looked as if theyd just been
left for a bit by men who were coming back at night The dog was howling
and looked hungry Their blankets were all thrown about Anyhow there
was a kettle on the fire which was gone out and more than that there
was the damper that Warrigal had seen lying in the ashes all burnt to a
cinder

Everything looked as if theyd gone off in a hurry and never come back
at night or since One of their horses was tied with a tether rope close
to the tent poles and hed been walking round and trampling down the
grass as if hed been there all night We couldnt make it out

We rode on hardly looking at one another but following Warrigal who
rattled on now hardly looking at the ground at all like a dog with a
burning scent All of a sudden he pulls up and points to a dip into a
cross gully like an old river which we all knew

You see um crow I bleeve longa Black Gully

Sure enough just above the drop down where we used to gallop our
ponies in old times and laugh to see em throw up their tails there
were halfadozen crows and a couple of eaglehawks high up in the sky
wheeling and circling over the same place

By George theyve got the old man says Jim Come on Dick I never
thought poor old dad would be run down like this

Or hes got them says Starlight curling his lip in a way he had I
dont believe your old governors dead till I see him The devil himself
couldnt grab him on his own ground




Chapter 38



We all pulled up at the side of the gully or dry creek whatever it was
and jumped off our horses leaving Warrigal to look after them and ran
down the rocky sides of it

Great God Starlight cries out whats that and he pointed to a
small sloping bit of grass just underneath the bank Who are they Can
they be asleep

They were asleep never to wake As we stood side by side by the dead
men for there were four of them we shook so Jim and I that we leaned
against one another for support We had never seen a sight before that
like it I never want to do so again

There they lay four dead men We didnt know them ourselves but
guessed they were Hagan and his lot How else did they come there and
how could dad have shot them all by himself and laid them out there
Were Daly and Moran with him This looked like Morans damnable work

We looked and looked I rubbed my eyes Could it be real The sky was
dark and the daylight going fast The mountain hung over us black and
dreadfullooking The wind whimpered up and down the hillside with
a sort of cry in it Everything was dark and dismal and almost
unnaturallooking

All four men were lying on their backs side by side with their eyes
staring up to the skystaringstaring When we got close beside them
we could see they had all been shotone man through the head the rest
through the body The two nearest to me had had their hands tied the
bit of rope was lying by one and his wrist was chafed

One had been so close to the man that shot him that the powder had burnt
his shirt It wasnt for anything they had either for every mans notes
and one had four fives and some ones were pinned to them outside of
their pockets as if to show every one that those who killed them wanted
their blood and not their money

This is a terrible affair boys said Starlight and his voice sounded
strange and hoarse I never thought we should be mixed up with a deed
like this I see how it was done They have been led into a trap Your
father has made em think they could catch him and had Daly and Moran
waiting for themone on each side of this hole here Warrigalfor he
had tied up his horse and crept uphow many bin here

Warrigal held up three fingers

That one ran down hereone after one I see em boot Moran stand
here Patsey Daly lie down behind that ole log All about bootnail
mark Old man Ben he stand here Dog bitem this one

Here he stooped and touched a dead mans ankle Sure enough there was
the mark of Cribs teeth with the front one missing that had been
kicked down his throat by a wild mare

Two fellow tumble down fustlike then two fellow bimeby
Onetwothree fellow track go along a flat that way Then that one get
two horses and ridem likit Fish River Penty blood tumble down here

This was the ciphering up of the whole thing It was clear enough now
Moran and Daly had waited for them here and had shot down the two first
men Of the others it was hard to say whether they died in fair fight
or had been taken prisoners and shot afterwards Either way it was bad
enough What a noise it would make The idea of four men well known
to the Government and engaged in hunting down outlaws on whose head a
price was set to be deliberately shotmurdered in cold blood as there
was some ground for thinking to be the case What would be the end of it
all

We had done things that were bad enough but a deliberate coldblooded
shameful piece of bloodshed like this had never been heard of in New
South Wales before

There was nothing more to be done We couldnt stay any longer looking
at the dead men it was no use burying them even if wed had the time
We hadnt done it though we should be sure to be mixed up with it
somehow

We must be moving lads said Starlight As soon as this gets wind
therell be another rush out this way and every policeman and newspaper
reporter in the country will be up at Black Gully When theyre found
everybody will see that theyve been killed for vengeance and not for
plunder But the sooner theyre found the better

Best send word to Billy the Boy I said hell manage to lay them on
without hurting himself

All right Warrigal knows a way of communicating with him Ill send
him off at once And now the sooner were at the Hollow the better for
everybody

We rode all night Anything was better than stopping still with such
thoughts as we were likely to have for companions About daylight we got
to the Hollow Not far from the cave we found fathers old mare with the
saddle on and the reins trailing on the ground There was a lot of blood
on the saddle too and the reins were smeared all about with it red
they were to the buckles so was her mane

We knew then something was wrong and that the old man was hard hit or
hed never have let her go loose like that When we got to the cave the
dog came out to meet us and then walked back whining in a queer way
towards the log at the mouth where we used to sit in the evenings

There was father sure enough lying on his face in a pool of blood and
to all appearances as dead as the men wed just left

We lifted him up and Starlight looked close and careful at him by the
light of the dawn that was just showing up over the tree tops to the
east

Hes not dead I can feel his heart beat he said Carry him in
boys and well soon see whats the matter with him

We took his waistcoat and shirt offa coat he never wore unless it was
raining Hard work we had to do it they was so stuck to his skin when
the blood had dried

By gum hes been hit bad enough says Jim Look here and here poor
old dad

Theres not much poor about it Jim says Starlight Men that play
at bowls must expect to get rubbers Theyve come off second best in
this row and I wish it had been different for several reasons

Dad was hit right through the top of the left shoulder The ball had
gone through the muscle and lodged somewhere We couldnt see anything
of it Another bullet had gone right through him as far as we could
make out under the breast on the righthand side

That looks like a goodbye shot says Starlight see how the blood
comes welling out still but it hasnt touched the lungs Theres no
blood on his lips and his breathing is all right Whats this Only
through the muscle of the right arm Thats nothing and this graze on
the ribs a mere scratch Dash more water in his face Jim Hes coming
to

After a few minutes he did come to sure enough and looked round when
he found himself in bed

Where am I says he

Youre at home I said in the Hollow

Dashed if I ever thought Id get here he says I was that bad I
nearly tumbled off the old mare miles away She must have carried me in
while I was unsensible I dont remember nothing after we began to get
down the track into the Hollow Where is she

Oh we found her near the cave with the saddle and bridle on

Thats all right Bring me a taste of grog will ye Im amost dead
with thirst Where did I come from last I wonder Oh I seem to know
now Settling accounts with thatdog that insulted my gal Moran got
square with tother Thatll learn em to leave old Ben Marston alone
when hes not meddling with them

Never mind talking about that now I said You had a near shave of
it and it will take you all your time to pull through now

I wasnt hit bad till just as I was going to drop down into Black
Gully he said I stood one minute and that cursed wretch Hagan had
a steady shot at me I had one at him afterwards though with his hands
tied too

God forgive you says Jim for shooting men in cold blood I couldnt
do it for all the gold in Turon nor for no other reason Itll bring us
bad luck too see if it dont

Youre too soft Jim says the old man You aint a bad chap but any
young fellow of ten years old can buy and sell you Wheres that brandy
and water

Here it is says Jim and then you lie down and take a sleep Youll
have to be quiet and obey orders nowthat is if a few more years
lifes any good to you

The brandy and water fetched him to pretty well but after that he began
to talk and we couldnt stop him Towards night he got worse and worse
and his head got hotter and he kept on with all kinds of nonsense
screeching out that he was going to be hung and they were waiting to
take him away but if he could get the old mare hed be all right
besides a lot of mixedup things about cattle and horses that we didnt
know the right of

Starlight said he was delirious and that if he hadnt some one to nurse
him hed die as sure as fate We couldnt be always staying with him
and didnt understand what was to be done much We didnt like to let
him lie there and die so at long last we made up our minds to see if we
could get Aileen over to nurse him for a few weeks

Well we scribbled a bit of a letter and sent Warrigal off with it
Wasnt it dangerous for him Not a bit of it He could go anywhere all
over the whole country and no trooper of them all could manage to put
the bracelets on him The way hed work it would be to leave his horse
a good way the other side of George Storefields and to make up as a
regular blackfellow He could do that firstrate and talk their lingo
too just like one of themselves Gin or blackfellow it was all
the same to Warrigal He could make himself as black as soot and
go barefooted with a blanket or a possum rug round him and beg for
siccapence and nobodyd ever bowl him out He took us in once at the
diggings Jim chucked him a shilling and told him to go away and not
come bothering near us

So away Warrigal went and we knew hed get through somehow He was one
of those chaps that always does what theyre told and never comes back
and says they cant do it or theyve lost their horse or cant find
the way or theyd changed their mind or something

No once hed started there was no fear of him not scoring somehow or
other Whatever Starlight told him to do day or night foul weather or
fair afoot or on horseback that thing was done if Warrigal was alive
to do it

What wed written to Aileen was telling her that father was that bad
we hardly thought hed pull through and that if she wanted to save his
life she must come to the Hollow and nurse him

How to get her over was not the easiest thing in the world but she
could ride away on her old pony without anybody thinking but she was
going to fetch up the cows and then cut straight up the gully to the
old yard in the scrub on Nulla Mountain One of us would meet her there
with a fresh horse and bring her safe into the Hollow If all went well
she would be there in the afternoon on a certain day anyhow wed be
there to meet her come or no come

She wouldnt fail us we were dead sure She had suffered a lot by him
and us too but like most women the very moment anything happened to
any of us even to dad everything flew out of her head except that
we were sick or sorry and wanted her help Help of course wasnt
she willing to give that and her rest and comfort health even life
itself to wear herself out hand and foot for any one of her own
family

So poor Aileen made her way up all alone to the old scrub stockyard Jim
and I had ridden up to it pretty early he wouldnt stop behind with a
nice wellbred little horse that had shone a bit at country races for
her to ride on We waited there a goodish while we lying down and our
horses hung up not far off for fear we might be jumped by the police
at any time

At last we sees the old ponys head coming bobbing along through the
scrub along the wornout cattle track grown up as it was and sure
enough there was Aileen on him with her gray riding skirt and an old
felt hat on Shed nothing with her she was afraid to bring a haporth
of clothes or anything for fear they should any of em tumble that she
was going a long way and perhaps follow her up So she had to hand
that over to Warrigal and trust to him to bring it on some way or
other We saw her before she saw us and Jim gave a whistle just as he
used to do when he was coming home late at night She knew it at once
and a smile for a minute came over her pale face such a sad sort of one
it was too as if she was wondering at herself that she could feel that
pleased at anything

Whatever thoughts was in her mind she roused up the old pony and came
towards us quick as soon as she catches sight of us In two seconds
Jim had lifted her down in his strong arms and was holding her off the
ground and hugging her as if shed been a child How the tears ran down
her cheeks though all the time she was kissing him with her arms round
his neck and me too when I came up just as if we were boys and girls
again

After a bit she wiped her eyes and said

Hows father

Very bad I said off his head and raving Itll be a close thing
with him Heres your horse now and a good one too We must let the old
pony go hell make home fast enough

She patted his neck and we turned him loose He slued round and went
away steady picking a bit as he went Hed be home next day easy
enough and nobody the wiser where hed been to

Wed brought a bit to eat and a glass of wine for the girl in case she
was faint but she wouldnt take anything but a crust of bread and a
drink of water There was a spring that ran all the year round near the
cattleyard and off went we old Lieutenant holding up his head and
showing himself off He didnt get such a rider on his back every day

What a dear horse she said as she pulled him together a bit like and
settled herself fair and square in the saddle Oh how I could enjoy
all this ifif O my God shall we ever know a moments peace and
happiness in this world again Are we always to be sunk in wretchedness
and misery as long as we live

We didnt lose much time after that you be sure Up and down thick and
open rough or smooth we made the pace good and Aileen gave us all we
knew to keep ahead of her We had a good light when we got to the drop
down into the Hollow The sun was just setting and if wed had time or
thought to give to the looks of things no doubt it was a grand sight

All the Hollow was lighted up and looked like a green sea with islands
of trees in it The rock towers on the other side of the range were
shining and glittering like as if they were made of crystallised quartz
or diamondsred and white There was a sort of mist creeping up the
valley at the lower end under the mountain that began to soften the fire
colours and mix them up like Even the mountain that mostly looked
black and dreary frowning at our ways was of purple and gold with
pale shadows of green and gray

Aileen pulled up as we did and jumped off our horses

So this is the Hollow she said half talking to herself that Ive
heard and thought so much about What a lovely lovely place Surely it
ought to have a different effect on the people that lived there

Better come off Ailie and lead your horse down here says Jim
unless you want to ride down like Starlight did the first time we saw
him

Starlight is he here she said in a surprised sort of way I never
thought of that

Of course he is where else should he be Why dont you lead on Dick

Wont you get off Its not altogether safe I said though
Lieutenants all right on his old pins

Safe she said with a bitter sort of laugh What does it matter if a
Marston girl does break her neck or her heart either

She never said another word but sat upright with a set face on her as
the old horse picked his way down after ours and except when he put
his foot on a rolling stone never made a slip or a stumble all the way
down though it was like going down the side of a house

When we got to the valley we put on a spurt to the cave and found
Warrigal sitting on the log in front of us Hed got home first of
course and there was Aileens bundle a biggish one too alongside
of him We could hear father raving and screaming out inside dreadful
Starlight wasnt nigh hand anywhere He had walked off when Warrigal
came home and left him to watch the old man

He been like that all the time Warrigal

No Captain say big one sleep Him give him medicine like then wake up
and go on likit that I believe him bad along a cobra

Aileen had jumped off her horse and gone in to the old man the moment we
came up and she heard his voice

All that long night we could hear him talking to himself groaning
cursing shouting arguing It was wonderful how a man who talked so
little as father could have had so many thoughts in his mind But then
they all are boxed up together in every mans heart At a time like this
they come racing and tumbling out like a flock of sheep out of a yard
when the hurdles down What a dashed queer thing human nature is when
you come to think of it That a man should be able to keep his tongue
quiet and shut the door on all the sounds and images and wishes that
goes racing about inside of his mind like wild horses in a paddock

One day hell be smiling and sensible looking so honest all the time
Next day a knock on the head or a little vein goes crack in the brain
as the doctor told me then the rails are down and everything comes
out with a rush into the light of dayright and wrong foul and fair
station brands and clearskins it dont make no difference

Father was always one of the closest men that ever lived He never told
us much about his old life at home or after he came out here Now he was
letting drop things here and there that helped us to a few secrets hed
never told to no man They made poor Aileen a bit more miserable than
shed been before if that was possible but it didnt matter much to
us We were pretty tired ourselves that night and so we got Aileen all
she wanted and left her alone with him

While we were away to meet her some one had taken the trouble to put up
a bit of a partition separating that part of the cave from the other
it was built up of stonethere was plenty aboutand not so roughly
done either It made Aileen feel a lot more comfortable Of course there
was only one man who could have done it and that was Starlight




Chapter 39



Towards morning father went into a heavy sleep he didnt wake till
the afternoon Poor Aileen was able to get a doze and change her
dress After breakfast while we were having a bit of a chat in walks
Starlight He bowed to Aileen quite respectful as he always did to a
woman and then shook hands with her

Welcome to the Hollow Miss Marston he said I cant say how charmed
I am in one sense though I regret the necessity which brought you
here

Im glad to come and only for poor fathers being so bad I could
delight in the life here

How do you find your father

He is asleep now and perhaps the rest will do him good

He may awake free from fever says Starlight I took the risk of
giving him an opiate before you came and I think the result has been
favourable

Oh I hope he will be better when he wakes says Aileen and that I
shall not have to watch through another dreadful night of raving I can
hardly bear it

You must make your brothers take their share its not fair to you

Thank you but I feel as if I couldnt leave him to anybody but myself
He seems so weak now a little neglect might kill him

Pardon me Miss Marston you overrate the danger Depend upon it your
respected parent will be quite a different man in a week though it may
be a month or more before he is fully recovered You dont know what a
constitution he has

You have given me fresh hope she said I feel quite cheered upthat
is and she sighed if I could be cheerful again about anything

Here she walked into the cave and sat down by father to watch till
he awoke and we all went out about our daily work whatever it
wasnothing very wonderful I daresay but it kept us from thinking

Starlight was right As luck would have it father woke up a deal better
than when he laid down The fever had gone away his head was right
again and he began to ask for something to eatleastways to drink
first But Aileen wouldnt give him any of that and very little to eat
Starlight had told her what to do in case he wanted what wasnt good for
him and as she was pretty middling obstinate like himself she took
her own ways

After this he began to get right it wasnt easy to kill old dad He
seemed to be put together with wire and whipcord not made of flesh and
blood like other men I dont wonder old Englands done so much and gone
so far with her soldiers and sailors if they was bred like him Its my
notion if they was caught young kept well under command and led by men
they respected a regiment or a manofwars crew like him would knock
smoke out of any other thousand men the world could put up Mores the
pity there aint some better way of keeping em straight than there is

He was weak for a bitvery weak hed lost a deal of blood and try
how he would he couldnt stand up long at a time and had to give in
and lie down in spite of himself It fretted him a deal of course hed
never been on his back before and he couldnt put up with it Then his
temper began to show again and Aileen had a deal to bear and put up
with

Wed got a few books and there was the papers of course so she used
to read to him by the hour together He was very fond of hearing about
things and like a good many men that cant read and write he was
clever enough in his own way When shed done all the newspapersthey
were old ones we took care not to get any fresh ones for fear shed
see about Hagan and the othersshe used to read about battles and
seafights to him he cared about them more than anything and one
night after her reading to him about the battle of Trafalgar he turned
round to her and says I ought to have been in that packet Ailie my
girl I was near going for a sailor once on board a manowar too
I tried twice to get away to sea that was before Id snared my first
hare and something stopped me both times Once I was fetched back and
flogged and pretty nigh starved I never did no good afterwards But
its came acrost me many and many a time that Id been a different sort
o chap if Id had my will then I was allays fond o work and there
couldnt be too much fightin for me so a manowar in those days
would have been just the thing to straighten me That was the best
chance I ever had Well I dont say as I havent had othersplenty in
this country and good ones too but it was too lateId got set When
a mans young thats the time he can be turned right way or wrong Its
none so easy afterwards

He went to sleep then and Aileen said that was the only time he ever
spoke to her in that way We never heard him talk like that nor nobody
else I expect

If we could have got some things out of our heads that was the
pleasantest time ever we spent in the Hollow After father could be
left by himself for a few hours we got out the horses and used to take
Aileen out for long rides all over the place from one end to the other
It did her good and we went to every hole and corner in it She was
never tired of looking at the great rock towers as we used to call em
where the sandstone walls hung over just like the pictures of castles
till Starlight said in the evenings you could fancy you saw flags
waving and sentinels walking up and down on them

One afternoon we went out to the place where the old hermit had lived
and died We walked over his old garden and talked about the box wed
dug up and all the rest of it Starlight came with us and he persuaded
Aileen to ride Rainbow that day and my word they made a splendid
pair

Shed dressed herself up that afternoon just a little bit more than
common poor thing and put a bit of pink ribbon on and trimmed up her
hat and looked as if she began to see a little more interest in things
It didnt take much to make her look nice particularly on horseback
Her habit fitted her out and out and she had the sort of figure
that when a girl can ride well and you see her swaying graceful and
easylike to every motion of a spirited horse makes you think her
handsomer than any woman can look on the ground We rode pretty fast
always and it brought a bit of colour to her face The old horse got
pulling and prancing a bit though he was that finetempered hed carry
a child almost and Jim and I thought we hadnt seen her look like
herself before this for years past

It was a beautiful warm evening though summer was over and we were
getting into the cold nights and sharp mornings again just before the
regular winter weather There was going to be a change and there were
a few clouds coming up from the northwest but for all that it had been
quite like a spring day The turf on all the flats in the Hollow was
splendid and sound The grass had never been cut up with too heavy
stocking which ruins half the country I believe and there was a
good thick undergrowth underneath We had two or three little creeks
to cross and they were pretty full except at the crossing places and
rippled over the stones and sparkled in the sun like the brooks wed
heard tell of in the old country Everything was so quiet and bright
and happylooking that we could hardly fancy we were the men we were
and that all this wild work had been going on outside of the valley that
looked so peaceful and innocent

There was Starlight riding alongside of Aileen on his secondbest horse
and he was no commoner either though he didnt come up to Rainbow nor
no other horse I ever saw talking away in his pleasant easygoing
way Youd think he hadnt got a thing to trouble him in the world She
for a wonder was smiling and seemed to be enjoying herself for once in
a way with the old horse arching his neck and spinning along under her
as light as a greyhound and as smooth as oil It was something like a
pleasant ride I never forgot that evening and I never shall

We rode up to the ruined hut of the solitary man who had lived there so
long and watched the sun go down so often behind the rock towers from
his seat under the big peach tree

What a wonderful thing to think of Aileen says as she slipped down
off her sidesaddle

We dismounted too and hung up our horses

Only to think that he was living here before we were born or father
came to Rocky Flat Oh if we could have come here when we were little
how we should have enjoyed it It would have seemed fairyland to us

It always astonishes me said Starlight how any human being can
consent to live year after year the same life in the same place I
should go mad halfadozen times over Change and adventure are the very
breath of my nostrils

He had the memory of his dead wife to keep him said Aileen Her
spirit soothed the restless heart that would have wandered far into the
wilds again

It may be so said Starlight dreamily I have known no such
influences An outlaw I by forest laws almost since the days of my
boyhood I shall be so till the day of my death he added

If I were a man I should go everywhere said Aileen her eyes
sparkling and her face regular lighted up I have never been anywhere
or seen anything hardly so much as a church a soldier a shopwindow
or the sea begging his pardon for putting him last But oh what a
splendid thing to be rich no not that altogether but to be able to go
wherever you liked and have enough not to be troubled about money

To be free and have a mind at ease it doesnt seem so much said
Starlight talking almost to himself and yet how we fools and madmen
shut ourselves out of it for ever for ever sometimes by a single act
of folly hardly crime That comes after

The sun is going down behind the great rock tower Aileen says as
if she hadnt heard him Perhaps she didnt When people have a lot on
their minds theyre half their time thinking their own thoughts How
all the lovely colours are fading away Life seems so much like thata
little brightness then gray twilight night and darkness so soon
after

Now and then theres a star you must admit that Miss Marston says
he cheerful and pleasant again he was never down for long at a time
And theres that muchabused luminary the moon youll see her before
we get home Were her sworn votaries and worshippers you know

We had to ride a bit to get home with any kind of light for we didnt
want father to be growling or kicking up a row with Warrigal that we
left to look after him But a few miles didnt matter much on such a
road and with horses in such buckle as ours

The stars came out after a while and the sky was that clear without a
cloud in it that it was a better light to ride by than the moon throws
Jim and I sometimes rode on one side and sometimes the other but there
was old Rainbow always in the lead playing with his bit and arching his
neck and going with Aileens light weight on him as if he could go on
all night at the same pace and think nothing of it and I believe he
could

When we got home dad was grumpy and wondered what we wanted riding
the horses about when there was nothing to do and nothing to see But
Warrigal had made him a pot of tea and he was able to smoke now so he
wasnt so bad after all We made ourselves pretty comfortableAileen
said shed got a good appetite for a wonderand we sat chatting round
the fire and talking away quite like old days till the moon was pretty
high

Father didnt get well all at once He went back twice because he would
try to do too much and wouldnt be said by Starlight or Aileen either
when he took a thing into his head then hed have to be nursed and
looked after day and night again just the same as ever So it took near
a month before he was regularly on his pins again and going about as
he did before he was hit His right arm was a bit stiff too it used to
pain and make him swear awful now and again Anyhow Aileen made us that
comfortable and happy while she was there we didnt care how long he
took getting well

Those were out and out the pleasantest days we ever spent in the
Hollowthe best time almost Jim and I had had since we were boys
Nearly every day we rode out in the afternoon and there wasnt a hole
or corner a spring or a creek inside the walls of the old Hollow that
we didnt show Aileen She was that sort of girl she took an interest
in everything she began to know all the horses and cattle as well as
we did ourselves Rainbow was regular given up to her and the old horse
after a bit knew her as well as his master I never seen a decent horse
that didnt like to have a woman on his back that is if she was young
and lissom and could ride a bit They seem to know in a sort of way
Ive seen horses that were no chop for a man to ride and that wouldnt
be particular about bucking you off if the least thing started them but
went as quiet as mice with a girl on their backs

So Aileen used to make Rainbow walk and amble his best so that all the
rest of us when she did it for fun had to jog Then shed jump him
over logs or the little trickling deep creeks that ran down to the main
water or shed pretend to have a race and go off full gallop riding
him at his best for a quarter of a mile then hed pull up as easy as if
hed never gone out of a walk

How strange all this is she said one day I feel as if I were living
on an island Its quite like playing at Robinson Crusoe only theres
no sea We dont seem to be able to get out all the same Its a happy
peaceful life too Why cant we keep on for ever like this and shut
out the wicked sorrowful world altogether

Quite of your opinion Miss Marston why should we ever change says
Starlight who was sitting down with the rest of us by the side of our
biggest river We had been fishing all the afternoon and done well Let
us go home no more I am quite contented But what about poor Jim He
looks sadder every day

He is fretting for his wife poor fellow and I dont wonder You are
one of those natures that never change Jim and if you dont get away
soon or see some chance of rejoining her you will die How you are to
do it I dont know

I am bound to make a try next month says Jim If I dont do
something towards it I shall go mad

You could not do a wiser thing says Starlight in one way or more
foolish thing in another Meantime why should we not make the best
of the pleasant surroundings with which Nature provides us heregreen
turf sparkling water good sport and how bright a day Could we be
more favoured by Fortune slippery dame that she is It is an Australian
Decameron without the naughty stories

Do you know sometimes I really think I am enjoying myself said
Aileen half to herself and then I feel that it must be a dream Such
dreadful things are waiting for mefor us all Then she shuddered and
trembled

She did not know the most dreadful thing of all yet We had carefully
kept it from her We chanced its not reaching her ears until after she
had got home safe and had time to grieve over it all by herself

We had a kind of feeling somehow that us four might never meet again
in the same way or be able to enjoy one anothers company for a month
without fear of interruption again as long as we lived

So we all made up our minds in spite of the shadow of evil that would
crawl up now and then to enjoy each others company while it lasted
and make the best of it

Starlight for all that seemed altered like and every now and then hed
go off with Warrigal and stay away from daylight to dark When he did
come hed sit for hours with his hands before him and never say a word
to any one I saw Aileen watch him when he looked like that not that
she ever said anything but pretended to take it as a matter of course

Other times hed be just as much the other way Hed read to her and
he had a good many books poetry and all kinds of things stowed away
in the part of the cave he called his own And hed talk about other
countries that hed been in and the strange people hed seen by the
hour together while she would sit listening and looking at him hardly
saying a thing and regular bound up in his words And he could talk
once he was set agoing I never saw a man that could come up to him

Aileen wasnt one of those sort of girls that took a fancy to any
goodlooking sort of fellow that came across her Quite the other way
She seemed to think so little about it that Jim and I always used to say
shed be an old maid and never marry at all And she used to say she
didnt think she ever would She never seemed to trouble her head about
the thing at all but I always knew that if ever she did set her fancy
upon a man and take a liking to him it would not be for a year or two
but for ever Though shed mothers good heart and softness about her
shed a dash of dads obstinacy in her blood and once she made up her
mind about anything she wasnt easy turned

Jim and I could see clear enough that she was taking to Starlight but
then so many women had done that had fallen in love with him and had
to fall out againas far as we could see He used to treat them all
alikevery kind and respectful but like a lot of children What was
the use of a wife to him No he said once or twice I can bear my
fate because my blood does not run in the veins of a living soul in
Australia If it were otherwise I could not bear my reflections As
it is the revolver has more than once nearly been asked to do me last
service

Though both Aileen and he seemed to like each other Jim and I never
thought there was anything in it and let them talk and ride and
walk together just as they pleased Aileen always had a good word for
Starlight and seemed to pity him so for having to lead such a life and
because he said he had no hope of ever getting free from it Then of
course there was a mystery about him Nobody knew who hed been or
almost where he had come fromnext to nothing about him had ever come
out He was an Englishmanthat was certainbut he must have come young
to the colony No one could look at him for a moment and see his pale
proud face his dark eyeshalfscornful halfgloomy except when
he was set up a bit and then you didnt like to look at them at
allwithout seeing that he was a gentleman to the tips of his
delicatelooking fingers no matter what hed done or where hed been

He was rather over the middle size because he was slight made he
always looked rather tall than not He was tremendous strong too
though he didnt look that and as active as a cat though he moved
as if walking was too much trouble altogether and running not to be
thought of

We didnt expect it would do either of em much good How could it even
if they did fall in love with one another and make it up to get married
But they were both able to take care of themselves and it was no use
interfering with em either They werent that sort

Starlight had plenty of money besides his share of the gold If we
could ever get away from this confounded rockwalled prison good as it
was in some ways and if he and Aileen and the rest of us could make a
clean dart of it and get to America we could live there free and happy
yet in spite of all that had come and gone

Aileen wasnt like to leave poor old mother as long as she wanted her
so it couldnt come off for a year or two at earliest and many things
were sure to happen in the meanwhile So we let all the talking and
walking and riding out in the evening go on as much as they pleased and
never said anything or seemed to take any notice at all about it

All this time mother was at George Storefields When Aileen ran over
that time he said it wasnt fit for them to live at Rocky Flat by
themselves So he went over that very daylike a good fellow as he
wasand brought over the old woman and made them both stay at his
house safe and comfortable When Aileen said she had to go away to
nurse dad he said he would take care of mother till she came back and
so shed been there all the time She knew Mrs Storefield Georges
mother well in the old times so they used to sit by the kitchen fire
when they wanted to be extra comfortable and knit stockings and talk
over the good old times to their hearts content

If it hadnt been for old Mrs Storefield I dont expect mother would
have contented herself therethe cottage was got so grand Aileen told
us and Gracey had to dress a bit now George had kept on making more
money in every way he tried it and of course he began bit by bit to
live according to his means

Hed bought cattlestations on the Lachlan just when the gold broke
out first and everybody thought station property was never going to
be worth nothing again Now since cattle had risen and meat and all to
such a price he was making money hand over fist More than that as I
said before hed been made a magistrate and all the swells began to
take notice of himnot altogether because hed made money either what
I call the real swells as far as I see wont do that If they dont
care for a manno matter how much money hes madethey hold shy of
him But if hes a straightgoing good sort of fellow that has his
head screwed on the right way and dont push himself forward too much
theyll meet him halfway and a very good thing too

We could see George was going upwards and out of our lot beginning to
mix with different people and get different notionsnot but what he was
always kind and friendly in his way to Aileen and mother and would have
been to us if hed ever seen us But all his new friends were different
kind of people and after a bit Aileen said wed only be remembered as
people hed known when he was young and soon when the old lady died
wed be asked into the kitchen and not into the parlour Aileen used to
laugh when she talked like this and say shed come and see George when
hed married a lady and what fun it would be to remind Gracey of the
time they threshed the oats out together at Rocky Flat But still
laugh and all I could see though she talked that way it made her feel
wretched all the while because she couldnt help thinking that we ought
to have done just as well as George and might have been nighhand as
far forward if wed kept straight If wed only kept straight Ah there
was where the whole mistake lay

It often seems to me as if men and women ought to have two livesan old
one and a new oneone to repent of the other the first one to show
men what they ought to keep clear of in the second When you think how
foolishlike and childish man or woman commits their first fault not so
bad in itself but enough often to shut them out from nearly all their
chances of good in this world it does seem hardish that one life should
end all under the sun Of course theres the other and we dont know
whats coming but theres so many different notions about that a chap
like me gets puzzled and looks on it as out of his line altogether

We werent sorry to have a little excuse to stop quiet at home for this
month We couldnt have done no good by mooching about and ten to one
while the chase was so hot after all that were supposed to have had a
hand in rubbing out Hagan and his lot we should have been dropped
upon The whole country was alive with scouting parties as well as
the regulars Youd have thought the end of the world was come Father
couldnt have done a better thing for himself and all of us than get hit
as he did It kept him and us out of harms way and put them off the
scent while they hunted Moran and Burke and the rest of their lot for
their lives They could hardly get a bit of damper out of a shepherds
hut without it being known to the police and many a time they got off
by the skin of their teeth




Chapter 40



At last father got well and said he didnt see what good Aileen could
do stopping any longer in the Hollow unless she meant to follow up
bushranging for a living Shed better go back and stay along with her
mother If George Storefield liked to have em there well and good
things looked as if it wasnt safe now for a mans wife and daughter
and if hed got into trouble to live peaceable and quiet in their own
house He didnt think they need be afraid of any one interfering with
them for the future though Here dad looked so dark that Aileen began
to think he was going to be ill again Wed all start and go a bit of
the way with her next dayto the old stockyard or a bit farther she
could ride from there and take the horse back with her and keep him if
she liked

Youve been a good gal to me he says to her you always was one and
your mothers been a good woman and a good wife tell her I said so Id
no call to have done the things I have or left home because it wasnt
tidy and clean and a welcome always when I came back Its been rough on
her and on you too my gal and if itll do her any good tell her Im
dashed sorry You can take this trifle of money You neednt boggle at
it its honest got and earned long before this other racket Now you
can go Kiss your old dad like as not you wont see him again

Wed got the horses in I lifted her up on to the saddle and she rode
out Her horse was all on the square so there was no harm in her taking
him back with her and off we went Dad didnt go after all We took it
easy out to the old stockyard We meant to camp there for halfanhour
and then to send her on with Warrigal to keep with her and show her the
way home

We didnt want to make the time too short What a lovely day it was The
mountain sides were clogged up with mist for an hour after we started
still any one that knew the climate would have said it was going to be
a fine day There wasnt a breath of air everything was that still that
not a leaf on any of the trees so much as stirred

When we came to the pass out of the valley we none of us got off it
was better going up than coming down and it would have tired Aileen
out at the start to walk up So the horses had to do their climbing It
didnt matter much to them We were all used to it horses and riders
Jim and I went first then Warrigal then Aileen and Starlight After we
got up to the top we all stopped and halted a bit to look round

Just then as if hed waited for us the sun came out from behind the
mountain the mists lifted and rolled away as if they had been gray
curtains Everything showed clear out like a playhouse the same Jim
and I used to see in Melbourne From where we stood you could see
everything the green valley flats with the big old trees in clumps
some of em just the same as theyd been planted The two little
riverlike silver threads winding away among the trees and far on the
opposite side the tall gray rocktowers shining among the forest edges
of the high green wall Somehow the sun wasnt risen enough to light
up the mountain It looked as black and dismal as if it was nightfall
coming on

Goodbye old Hollow Aileen called out waving her hand Everything
looks bright and beautiful except the mountain How gloomy it appears
as if it held some dreadful secretdoesnt it Ah what a pleasant time
it has been for me Am I the same Aileen Marston that went in there a
few weeks since And now I suppose there will be more misery and anxiety
waiting for all of us when I get back Well come what will I have had
a little happiness on this earth In heaven there must be rest

We all rode on but none of us seemed to care to say much Every step we
went seemed to be taking us away from the place where wed all been so
happy together The next change was sure to be for the worse What it
would be or when it would come we none of us could tell

Starlight and Aileen rode together most of the way and talked a good
deal we could see Before we got to the stockyard she rode over to Jim
and cheered him up as much as she could about Jeanie She said shed
write to her and tell her all about him and how happy wed all been
together lately and tell her that Jim would find some way to get down
to her this spring if he could manage it any road

If Im above ground tell her Ill be with her says poor old Jim
before Christmas If she dont see me then Ill be dead and she may
put on black and make sure shes a widow

Oh come you mustnt talk like that Jim and look to the bright side
a bit Theres a good chance yet now the countrys so full of diggers
and foreigners You try your luck and youll see your wife yet

Then she came to me and talked away just like old times

Youre the eldest Dick she said and so its proper for me to say
what Im going to say Then she told me all that was in her heart about
Starlight He and she had made it up that if he could get away to a
foreign country she would join him there and take mother with her
There was to be no marrying or lovemaking unless they could carry out
that plan Then she told me that she had always had the same sort of
feeling towards him When I saw him first I thought I had never seen
a man beforenever one that I could care for or think of marrying And
now he has told me that he loves meloves me a poor ignorant girl that
I am and I will wait for him all my life and follow him all round the
world I feel as if I could die for him or wear out my life in trying
to make him happy And yet and yet she said and all her face grew
sad and put on the old look that I knew so well so hopeless so full
of quiet bearing of pain I have a kind of feeling at my heart that it
will never be Something will happen to me or to him We are all doomed
to sorrow and misfortune and nothing can save us from our fate

Aileen dear I said you are old enough to know whats best for
yourself I didnt think Starlight was on for marrying any woman but
hes far and away the best man weve ever known so you can please
yourself But you know what the chances are If he gets clear off or
any of us after whats been done youre right But its a hundred to
one against it

Ill take the odds says she holding up her head Im willing to
put my life and happiness what little theres left of it on the wager
Things cant well be worse

I dont know I said I ought to tell youI must tell you something
before we part though Id a deal rather not But youll bear it better
now than in a surprise

Not more blood more wickedness she said in a halfwhisper and then
she looks up stern and angrylike When is this list of horrible things
to stop

It was none of our doing Moran and Daly were in it and

And none of you Swear that she said so quick and pitifullike

None of us I said again nor yet Warrigal

Then who did it Tell me all Im not a child I will know

You remember the man that was rude to you at Rocky Flat and father and
he fired at one another

Of course I do cowardly wretch that he was Then Moran was waiting for
them up the gully I wondered that they did not come back next day

They never came back I said

Why you dont mean to tell me that they are all dead all fourthose
strong men Oh surely not Dick and she caught hold of my arm and
looked up into my face

Yes Aileen all We came after and followed up dad when we got home
its a wonder he did it by himself But we saw them all four lying
stretched out

She put down her head and never spoke more till we parted

     

We turned back miserable enough all of us God knows After having
Aileen to make the place bright and pleasant and cheer us all up losing
her was just as if all the little pleasure we had in our lives was
dropped out of themlike the sun going out of the sky and the
wind rising like the moon clouding over and a fog burying up
everythingdark and damp the same as wed had it many a time
cattledriving by night We hardly spoke a word to one another all the
way home and no wonder

Next day we all sat about looking more down on our luck dad said than
any day since wed turned out Then Starlight told him about him and
Aileen how theyd made it up to be married some day or other Not
yet of course but if he could get away by Melbourne to some of these
placesthe islands on the Pacific coast where vessels were always
sailing forhe didnt see why his luck shouldnt change I have always
thought your daughter he says to father one of the grandest women I
ever met in any degree gentle or simple She has had the imprudence
to care for me so unless you have some wellgrounded objectionand I
dont say you havent mind you I should if I were in your placeyou
may as well say youre contented and wish us luck

Father was a long time before he said anything He sat there looking
very sullen and setlike while Starlight lit a cigar and walked quietly
up and down a few paces off

Dad answers at last I dont say but what other lads would have suited
better if theyd come off but most things goes contrary in this world
The only thing as Im doubtful of Captain is your luck If thats bad
all the trying and crying wont set it right And its great odds as
youll be caught or shot afore the years out For that matter every
one of us is working for Government on the same road But the gals a
good gal and if shes set her fancy on you I wont block her Youre a
pair of dashed fools thats all botherin your heads with the like at
a time like this when you boys are all more likely to have a rope round
your necks than any gals arms good or bad Have your own way You
always managed to get it somehow or other ever since I knowed ye

After this father lit his pipe and went into the cave

By and by he comes out again and catches the old mare

I aint been out of this blessed hole he says for a month of
Sundays Im dead tired of seeing nothin and doin nothin Ill crawl
over to old Davys for our letters and papers We aint heard nothing
for a year seems to me

Dad was strong enough to get about in the saddle again and we werent
sorry to get shut of him for a bit He was that cranky at times there
was no living with him As for ourselves we were regular wild for some
sort of get away for a bit of a change so we hadnt talked it over very
long before we made up our minds to take a run over to Jonathan Barness
and have a bit of fun just to take the taste out of our mouths of
Aileens going away

We had to dress ourselves very quiet and get fresh horsesnags that had
nothing particular about them to make people look at the same time with
a bit of go in them in case we were pushed at any time

No sooner said than done We went to work and got everything ready and
by three oclock we were offall three of us and never in better heart
in our livesfor a bit of fun or devilment it didnt matter which came
first

When we got to Jonathans it was latish but that didnt matter to us or
to the girls neither they were always ready for a bit of fun night or
day However just at first they pretended to be rather high and mighty
about this business of Hagans

Oh its you is it says Bella after we walked in I dont know as
its safe for us to be knowing such dangerous characters Theres a new
law against harbouring father says Hes pretty frightened I can tell
you and for two pins wed be told to shut the door in your faces

You can do that if you like now says I we shant want telling
twice I daresay But what makes you so stiff tonight

Why Hagans business of course says Maddie four men killed in
cold blood Only I know you couldnt and wouldnt be in it Id not know
any of ye from a crow There now

Quite right most beauteous Madeline says Starlight it was a very
dreadful affair though I believe there was some reason for old Ben
being angry Of course you know we werent within miles of the place
when it was done You remember the night we were here last

Of course we do Captain quite well Werent you going to dance at
Bellas wedding and all Youll have to do that sooner than we expected
though

Glad to hear it but listen to me my dear I want you to know the
truth We rode straight back to theto where we livedand of course
found the old man gone away from the place We tracked him right enough
but came up when it was all over Daly and Moran were the chief actors
in that tragedy

Oh we said it was Morans work from the first didnt we Bill Its
just the line hes cut out for I always think he ought to have a bowl
and dagger He looks like the villain on the stage

On or off the stage he can support the principal part in that line most
naturally says Starlight but I prophesy he will be cut off in the
midst of his glorious career Hes beastly cunning but hell be trapped
yet

Its a pity Jim cant stay a few days with us says Maddie I believe
wed find a way of passing him on to Victoria Ive known more than one
or two or halfadozen either that has been put through the same way

For Gods sake Mad lay me on says poor Jim and Ill go on my
knees to you

Oh I daresay says Maddie looking saucy but I like a man to be
fond of some woman in a proper way even if it isnt me so Ill do what
I can to help you to your wife and pickaninny

We must get you into the police force Maddie says Starlight
or make you a sort of inspector unattached if youre so clever at
managing these little affairs But whats the idea

Well says she settling herself in a chair spreading out her dress
and looking very knowing theres an old gentleman being driven all the
way overland in a sort of light Yankee trap and the young fellow thats
driving has to find horses and feed em and get so much for the trip

Who is it says I

Oh you know him says Maddie looking down hes a great friend
of mine a steadygoing goodconducted chap and hes a littleyou
understandwell shook on me I could persuade him a bit that is

I dont doubt that at all says I

Oh you know him a little He says he saw you at the Turon he was
working with some Americans His names Joe Moreton

I remember him well enough he used to wear a moustache and a chin
beard and talk Yankee Only for that he was a good deal like Jim we
always said so

Do you see anything now Dick you thats so sharp says Maddie

Bless my soul says Starlight of course it is as clear as your
beautiful eyes Jim is to shave his beard talk like a Yankee and go in
Joe Moretons place I see it all Maddie persuading Joe to consent to
the exchange of duties

But what will his employer say

Oh hes as bad as bad can be with the sandy blight says Maddie
wears green goggles poor old gentleman Hell never know nothing and
hell be able to swear up for Jim if the police pull him anywhere this
side of the Murray

Wed told Maddie that money neednt stand in the way so she was to
promise Joe the full sum that he was to get for his contract would be
paid to him in cash that nightJim to pay his own expenses as he went
the same as he was to do himself Of course she could get the money from
old Jonathan A word from us then was worth a deal more than thatd come
to Money wasnt the worst thing we had to care about

They would have to change clothes and hed tell Jim about the horses
the stages and how to answer the old cove and what to do to humour him
as they went along If hed had his full eyesight he might have noticed
some difference but as it was it was as much as the poor old chap
she believed could see there was a driver at all His eyes was bound up
mostly he had a big shade over em and was half the night swabbing and
poulticing and putting lotion into em Hed got sandy blight that bad
it would take months to get right Once you get a touch like that its
a terror I can tell you Ive had it that bad myself I had to be led
about

After a lot of talking that Jim was to try his luck as the Rev Mr
Watsons coachman he was mad to get away somehow and such another
chance might never turn up in a month of Sundays He would have plenty
of time to shave his beard and make himself look as like as ever he
could to Joe Moreton Maddie said shed see after that and it would
be as good as a play Lucky for old Jim wed all taken a fancy at the
Turon for once in a way to talk like Arizona Bill and his mates just
for the fun of the thing There were so many Americans there at first
and they were such swells with their silk sashes bowie knives and
broadleafed fullshare hats that lots of the young native fellows
took a pride in copying them and could walk and talk and guess and
calculate wonderful well considering Besides most of the natives have
a sort of slow sleepy way of talking so it partly came natural to this
chap Joe Moreton and Jim There couldnt be a better chance so we
thought wed stay a day and give Jim a send off all square and regular
It wasnt no ways too safe but we wanted a bit of a jollification and
we thought wed chance it

That night we had a regular good ball The girls got some of the young
fellows from round about to come over and a couple or two other girls
and we had no end of fun There was plenty of champagne and even Jim
picked up a bit and what with being grateful to Maddie for giving him
this lift and better in spirits on the chance of seeing Jeanie again
he was more like his own self Maddie said he looked so handsome she had
half a mind to throw over Joe Moreton after all

Joe came rather latish and the old gentleman had a cup of tea and went
to bed at once leaving word for Joe that he wanted to start almost
before daylight or as soon as he could see to drive so as to get
halfway on their stage before the sun was hot

After Joe had seen to his horses and put the trap away he came into the
house and had a glass or two and wired in with the rest of us like a
good un After a bit we see Maddie corner him off and have a long talk
very serious too After that they went for a walk in the garden and was
away a good while When she came back she looked over at Jim and nodded
as much as to say Its all right and I saw poor old Jims face
brighten up as if a light had passed over it

By and by she came over and told us all about it Shed had a hard
matter to manage it for Joe was a square sort of fellow that had a
place of his own and at first didnt like the notion of being mixed up
with our crowd at all But he was regular shook on Maddie and she went
at him as only a woman can and I daresay though she didnt tell us
made it part of the bargain if she was to marry him to help Jim in
this particular way He was to be well paid for this journey by old Mr
Watson and he wanted a bit of money before harvest or he wouldnt have
taken the job at all

The end of it was that Jim and Joe sat up ever so late pretty well
on to daylight smoking and yarning and Joe practising Jim in all the
things he was to do and say giving him a kind of chart of the stages
and telling him the sort of answers he was to give to the old chap It
was just before daylight when they knocked off and then Joe goes and
peels off his duds and hands em over to Jim rough greatcoat and
allup to his chin and down to his toes

Joe takes Jims togs They fitted him all to pieces and Jim hands him
over his horse saddle revolver and spurs and tells him the old horse
is a real plum and he hopes hell be good to him Then Jim shakes hands
with us all round Blessed if the girls wasnt up too and had some
coffee smoking hot for us We can sleep when youre all gone says
Maddie and perhaps we shant see old Jim any more this was said when
Joe was out of the room so heres good luck and when youve got your
wife and child again dont forget Maddie Barnes Then she shook hands
with him and made a quick bolt to her own room Queer things women are
my word

When old Jim drove round to the front with the pair of horses setting
up square with his big coat and Joes fullshare hat on him we all
bursted out laughing Hed first of all gone to the old gentlemans room
and sung out All aboard sir times up just to liven him up a bit
Joe kept away down at the stable

Well presently out comes the old chap with a veil on and his green
goggles winkin and blinkin as if he couldnt see a door from a
window He drinks off a cup of coffee and takes a munch of bread and
butter makes a kind of bow to Bella and shuffles into his carriage
Jim touches up the horses and away they go We rose a bit of a cheer
Maddie waved her handkerchief out of the window Jim looked round and
raised his whip That was the last sight any of us had of him for many a
day Poor old Jim




Chapter 41



We hadnt been long at home just enough to get tired of doing nothing
when we got a letter from Bella Barnes telling us that she was going to
get married the day after the Turon races and reminding Starlight that
he had promised to come to her wedding If he didnt think it was too
risky she hoped hed come There was going to be a race ball and it
was sure to be good fun It would be a good windup and Maddie was
coming out a great swell Sir Ferdinand would be there but thered be
such a crowd anybody would pass muster and so on

 Yours sincerely

 Isabella Barnes

PSThere was a big handicap with 500 added hadnt we a good horse
enough


Well done Bella says Starlight I vote we go Dick I never went to
a hop with a price on my head before A thousand pounds too Quite a
new sensation It settles the question And well enter Rainbow for
the handicap He ought to be good enough for anything theyre likely to
have

Captain Starlights Rainbow 9 st 8 lb I said with Dick Marston
to lead him up to the judges box How will that wash And what are the
police going to be about all the time Bellas gone out of her senses
about her marriage and thinks we are too

Youre a good fellow Richard and stanch but youre like your
fatheryou havent any imagination I see halfadozen ways of doing
the whole thing Besides our honours concerned I never made a promise
yet for good or for evil that I didnt carry out and some have cost
me dearly enough God knows Fancy running our horses and going to the
ball under the noses of the policethe idea is delicious

I daresay youre about tired of your life I said Im pretty sure I
am but why we should ride straight into the lions mouth to please
a silly girl I cant see I havent over much sense I know or I
shouldnt be here but Im not such a dashed fool as all that comes to

My mind is made up RichardI have decided irrevocably Of course you
neednt come if you see objections but Ill bet you my Dean and Adams
revolver and the Navy Colt against your repeating rifle that I do all
Ive said and clear out safe

Done I said Ive no doubt youll try but you might as well try
to pull down the walls of Berrima Gaol with a hayrake Youll make Sir
Ferdinands fortune thats all He always said hed die happy if he
could only bag you and the Marstons Hell be made InspectorGeneral of
Police

Starlight smiled in his queer quiet way

If he doesnt rise to the top of the tree until he takes mealive I
meanhell die a subinspector But wed better sleep on it This is an
enterprise of great pith and moment and requires no end of thought We
must get your sister to come over That will crown all

Goodnight I said rather hasty Wed better turn the Hollow into
Tarban Creek and advertise for boarders

Next morning I expected hed think better of itwed had a glass or two
of grog but no he was more set on it than ever and full of dodges
to work it to rights He certainly was wonderful clever in all sorts of
ways when there was any devilment to be carried out Half as much in
the straight way would have made a man of him But thats the way of the
world all over He aint the only one

As for father he was like me and looked on the notion as rank
foolishness He swore straight on end for about twenty minutes and then
said he expected Starlight would have his own way as usual but hed
play at that game once too often He supposed hed be left in the Hollow
all by himself with Warrigal and the dog for company

Warrigal goes with memight want him says Starlight Youre losing
your nerve governor Perhaps youd like to go to the ball too

Father gave a sort of growl and lit his pipe and wouldnt say no more
Starlight and I regular talked it out and after Id heard all he had
to say it didnt look quite so impossible as it did at first We were
to work apart He was to get in with some of the betting men or sporting
people that always came to country races and I was to find out some
of our old digger mates and box up with them Warrigal would shift for
himself and look after the horses and have them ready in case we had to
clear at short notice

And who was to enter Rainbow and look after him

Couldnt we get old Jacob Benton hes the best trainer Ive seen since
I left home Billy the Boy told us the other day he was out of a job
and was groom at Jonathans had been sacked for getting drunk and so
on Hell be all the more likely to keep sober for a month

The very man I said He can ride the weight and train too But we
cant have him here surely

No but I can send the horse to him at Jonathans and he can get him
fit there as well as anywhere Theres nearly a month yet hes pretty
hard and hes been regularly exercised lately

Jacob Benton was a wizened driedup old Yorkshireman Hed been head
man in a good racing stable but drink had been the ruin of himlost
him his place and sent him out here He could be trusted to go right
through with a job like ours for all that Like many men that drink
hard he was as sober as a judge between one burst and another And once
he took over a horse in training he touched nothing but water till the
race was run and the horse back in his box Then he most times went in
an awful perishertook a month to it and was never sober day or night
the whole time When hed spent all his money hed crawl out of the
township and get away into the country more dead than alive and take
the first job that offered But he was fonder of training a good horse
than anything else in the world and if hed got a regular flyer and
was treated liberal hed hardly allow himself sleep or time to eat his
meals till hed got him near the mark He could ride too and was an
outandout judge of pace

When wed regular chalked it out about entering Rainbow for the Grand
Turon Handicap we sent Warrigal over to Billy the Boy and got him to
look up old Jacob He agreed to take the old horse the week before
the races and give him a last bit of Frenchpolish if wed keep him in
steady work till then From what he was told of the horse he expected he
would carry any weight he was handicapped for and pull it off easy He
was to enter him in his own name the proper time before the races If
he won he was to have ten per cent on winnings if he lost a tenpound
note would do him He could ride the weight with some lead in his
saddle and hed never wet his lips with grog till the race was over

So that part of the work was chalked out The real risky business was to
come I never expected we should get through all straight But the more
I hung back the more shook on it Starlight seemed to be He was like a
boy home from school sometimesmad for any kind of fun with a spice of
devilment in it

About a week before the races we all cleared out leaving father at
home and pretty sulky too Warrigal led Rainbow he was to take him to
Jonathan Barness and meet old Jacob there He was to keep him until
it was time to go to Turon We didnt show there ourselves this time we
were afraid of drawing suspicion on the place

We rode right into Turon taking care to be well after dark A real
pleasure it was to see the old place again The crooked streets the
lightedup shops the crowd of jolly diggers walking about smoking or
crowding round the publichouse bars the row of the stampers in the
quartzcrushing machines going night and day It all reminded me of the
pleasant year Jim and I had spent here I wished wed never had to leave
it We parted just outside the township for fear of accidents I went
to a little place I knew where I put up my horsecould be quiet there
and asked no questions Starlight as usual went to the best hotel
where he ordered everybody about and was as big a swell as ever He had
been out in the northwest country and was going to Sydney to close for
a couple of stations that had been offered to him

That night he went to the barber had his hair cut and his beard shaved
only leaving his moustache and a bit of whisker like a ribbon He put on
a suit of tweed all one colour and ordered a lot more clothes which
he paid for and were to be left at the hotel till he returned from
Sydney

Next day he starts for Sydney what he was going to do there he didnt
say and I didnt ask him Hed be back the day before the races and
in good time for all the fun and Bellas wedding into the bargain I
managed to find out that night that Kate Mullockson had left Turon She
and her husband had sold their place and gone to another diggings just
opened I was glad enough of this for I knew that her eyes were sharp
enough to spy me out whatever disguise I had on and even if she didnt
I should always have expected to find her eyes fixed upon me I breathed
freer after I heard this bit of news

The gold was better even than when we were there A lot of men who were
poor enough when we were there had made fortunes The field never looked
better and the harddriving wellpaid jolly mining life was going
on just the same as ever every one making money fastspending it
fasterand no one troubling themselves about anything except how much
the washdirt went to the load and whether the sinking was through the
false bottom or not

When I first came I had a notion of mating in with some diggers but
when I saw how quiet everybody took it and what thousands of strangers
there were all over the place I gave myself out for a speculator in
mining shares from Melbourne So I shaved off most of my beard had my
hair cut short and put on a tall hat I thought that would shift any
sort of likeness there might be to my old self and though it was
beastly uncomfortable I stuck to it all the time

I walked about among the stables and had a good look at all the horses
that were in training Two or three good ones as usual and a lot
of duffers If Rainbow wasnt beat on his condition he had pace and
weightcarrying for the best of them I hardly thought he could lose
it or a bigger stake in better company I was that fond of the horse I
thought he was good enough for an English Derby

Well I kept dark you be sure and mooned about buying a share at
a low price now and then just to let em see I had money and meant
something My name was Mr Bromford and I lived at Petersham near
Sydney

The day before the races there was a lot of excitement in the town
Strangers kept pouring in from everywhere round about and all the
hotels were crammed full Just as I was wondering whether Starlight was
going to turn up till next day I saw a fourinhand drag rattle down
the street to the principal inn and a crowd gather round it as three
gentlemen got out and went into the inn

Youll see after all our luggage will you ostler says one of them
to the groom and whatever you do dont forget my umbwella

Some of the diggers laughed

Know those coves I said to a man that stopped at the same house as I
did

Dont you know Thems the two Mr Dawsons of Wideview great sporting
men natives and ever so rich Theyve some horses to run tomorrow
Thats a new chum from England thats come up with em

I hardly knew him at first His own mother wouldnt I believe Hed
altered himself that wonderful as I could hardly even now think it was
Starlight and yet he wasnt a bit like the young Englishman he gammoned
to be last year or the Hon Frank Haughton either He had an eyeglass
this time and was a swell from top to toe How and when hed picked
up with the Mr Dawsons I couldnt tell but hed got a knack of making
people like himespecially when they didnt know him Not that it was
worse when they did It wasnt for that He was always the same The
whitest man I ever knew or ever shallthat I say and stick tobut of
course people cant be expected to associate with men that have done
time Well next day was the races I never saw such a turnout in the
colony before Every digger on the field had dropped work for the day
all the farmers and squatters and country people had come in for miles
round on all sides The Commissioner and all the police were out in full
uniform and from the first moment the hotels were opened in the morning
till breakfast time all the bars were full and the streets crowded with
miners and strangers and people that seemed to have come from the ends
of the earth When I saw the mob there was I didnt see so much to
be jerran about as it was fifty to one in favour of any one that was
wanted in the middle of such a muster of queer cattle as was going on
at Turon that day

About eleven oclock every one went out to the course It wasnt more
than a mile from town The first race wasnt to be run till twelve but
long before that time the road was covered with horsemen traps of every
kind and sort every horse and mare in the whole district

Most of the miners went in fourhorse coaches and buses that were
plying all day long from the town and back very few walked The country
people mostly drove in springcarts or rode on horseback Any young
fellows that had a good horse liked to show him off of course the
girls in habits of their own make perhaps and now and then a top hat
though they looked very well too They could ride some of them above a
bit and it made me think of the old days when Jim and I and Aileen used
to ride into Bargo races together and how proud we were of her even
when she was a little thing and we used to groom up the old pony till
we nearly scrubbed the hide off him

It was no use thinking of that kind of thing and I began to wonder how
Starlight was getting on with his friends when I saw the Dawsons drag
come up the straight with four upstanding ripping bay horses in top
condition and well matched There was Starlight on the box seat
alongside of Jack Dawson the eldest brother who could handle the
ribbons in style and was a man every inch of him only a bit too fast
didnt care about anything but horses and dogs and lived every day of
his life The other brother was standing up behind leaning over
and talking to Starlight who was in great form as he used to say
himself and looked as if hed just come out of a bandbox

He had on a silk coat buttoned round him a white top hat with a blue
silk veil His eyeglass was stuck in his eye all the time and he had
kid gloves on that fitted his hands like wax I really couldnt hardly
take my oath he was the same man and no wonder nobody else couldnt I
was wondering why Sir Ferdinand wasnt swelling about bowing to all
the ladies and making that thoroughbred of his dance and arch his neck
when I heard some one say that hed got news that Moran and the rest of
em had stuck up a place about forty miles off towards Forbes and
Sir Ferdinand had sworn at his luck for having to miss the races but
started off just as he was and taken all the troopers but two with him

Who brought the news

Oh a youngster called William Jonessaid he lived out there A black
boy came with him that couldnt hardly speak English he went with em
to show the way

Well but how did they know it was true says I It might have been
only a stall

Oh the young fellow brought a letter from the overseer saying they
might hold out for a few hours if the police came along quick

Its a good thing they started at once says I Them boys are very
useful sometimes and blackfellows too

I went off then and had a laugh to myself I was pretty middling
certain it was Billy the Boy and Warrigal Starlight had wrote the note
before we started only I didnt think theyd be game to deliver it
themselves

Now the police was away all but a couple of young fellowsI went and
had a look to make surethat didnt know any of us by sight I thought
we might enjoy ourselves for once in a way without watching every one
that came nigh us And we did enjoy ourselves I did I know though
youd think as we carried our lives in our hands in a manner of
speaking the fun couldnt have been much But its a queer world
Men like us that dont know whats to happen to them from one day to
another if they can only see their way for a week ahead often have
more real pleasure in the bit of time they have to themselves than many
a man has in a year that has no call to care about time or money or be
afraid of anybody

As for Starlight if hed been going to be hung next week it would have
been all one to him Hed have put off thinking about it until about an
hour before and then would have made all his arrangements and done the
whole business quietly and respectably without humbug but without
any flashness either You couldnt put him wrong or make him do or say
anything that was out of place

However this time nobody was going to be hung or took or anything else
Wed as good as got a free pardon for the time being now the police
was away no one else would have meddled with us if wed had our names
printed on our hats So we made the most of it I expect Starlight
carried on all sorts of high ropes He was introduced to all the nobs
and I saw him in the grand stand and the saddlingpaddock taking the
odds in tens and fifties from the ringmenhed brought a stiffish roll
of notes with himand backing the Dawson stable right out

It turned out afterwards that hed met them at an inn on the mountains
and helped them to doctor one of their leaders that had been griped So
they took a fancy to him and being freehearted sort of fellows asked
him to keep them company in the drag and let one of the grooms ride his
horse Once he started he kept them alive you may be sure and by the
time they got to Turon they were ready to go round the world with him
and swore theyd never met such a man in their livesvery likely they
hadnt either He was introduced to the judge and the stewards and the
Commissioner and the police magistrate and as much fuss made over him
as if he was the Governors son It was as good as a play I got up as
near as I dared once or twice and I couldnt hardly keep from bursting
out laughing when I saw how grave he talked and drawled and put up his
eyeglass and every now and then made em all laugh or said something
reminded him of India where hed last come from

Well that was a regular fizzer of a spree if we never had another The
racing was very fair and as luck would have it the Dawson horses won
all the big money and as they started at longish odds they must have
made a pot of money and Starlight too as hed gone in a docker for
their stable This made them better friends than ever and it was Dawson
here and Lascelles there all over the course

Well the day went over at last and all of them that liked a little
fun and dancing better than heavy drinking made it up to go to the race
ball It was a subscription affairguinea tickets just to keep out the
regular roughs and the proceeds to go to the Turon Jockey Club Fund
All the swells had to go of course and though they knew it would be
a crush and pretty mixed as I heard Starlight say the room was large
the band was good and they expected to get a fair share of dancing
after an hour or so

Starlight and the Dawsons dined at the camp and were made a good deal
oftheir health drunk and what notand Starlight told us afterwards
he returned thanks for the strangers and visitors said hed been told
Australia was a rough place but he never expected to find so much
genuine kindness and hospitality and he might add so much refinement
and gentlemanly feeling Speaking for himself he had never expected
considering his being a total stranger to be welcomed so cordially
and entertained so handsomely more particularly at the mess of her
Majestys goldfields officials whose attention on this occasion they
might be assured he would never forget He would repeat the events of
this particular day would never be effaced from his memory Tremendous
cheering

After dinner and when the champagne had gone round pretty reasonable
the Commissioner proposed they should all adjourn to the ball when if
Mr Lascelles cared about dancing he ventured to think a partner or
two could be found for him So they all got up and went away down to the
hall of the Mechanics Institutea tremendous big room that had been
built to use as a theatre and to give lectures and concerts in These
sort of things are very popular at diggings Miners like to be amused
and have plenty of money to spend when times are good There was hardly
a week passed without some kind of show being on when we went there

I walked down quietly an hour or so before most of the people so as
to be in the way to see if Aileen came Wed asked her to come on the
chance of meeting us there but we hadnt got any word and didnt know
whether she could manage it nor whether George would bring her I had
a sort of halfandhalf notion that perhaps Gracey might come but I
didnt like to think of it for fear of being disappointed and tried to
make believe I didnt expect her

I gave in my ticket and walked in about eight oclock and sat down
pretty close to the door so that I could see the people as they came in
I didnt feel much up to dancing myself but Id have ridden a thousand
miles to have had the chance of seeing those two girls that night

I waited and waited while one after another came in till the big hall
was pretty near filled and at nine oclock or so the music struck up
and the first dance began That left the seats pretty bare and between
listening to the music and looking at the people and thinking I was
back again at the old claim and passing halfanhour at a dancehouse
I didnt mind the door so much till I heard somebody give a sort of
sigh not very far off and I looked towards the door and saw two women
sitting between me and it

They were Aileen and Gracey sure enough My head almost turned round
and I felt my heart beatbeat in a way it never did when the bullets
were singing and whistling all about It was the suddenness of it I
expect I looked at them for a bit They didnt see me and were just
looking about them as I did They were dressed very quiet but Gracey
had a little more ornament on her and a necklace or something round her
neck Aileen was very pale but her beautiful dark hair was dressed up a
bit with one rosebud in it and her eyes looked bigger and brighter than
they used to do She looked sad enough but every now and then Gracey
said something that made her smile a bit and then I thought she was the
handsomest girl in the room Gracey had just the same steady serious
kind face as ever shed hardly changed a bit and seemed pleased just
like a child at the play with all that was going on round about

There was hardly anybody near the corner where they were so I got up
and went over They both looked at me for a minute as if theyd never
seen me before and then Aileen turned as pale as death and Gracey got
altogether as red and both held out their hands I sat down by the side
of Aileen and we all began to talk Not much at first and very quiet
for fear notice might be taken but I managed to let them know that the
police had all been called off in another direction and that we should
be most likely safe till tomorrow or next day

Oh dear says Gracey wasnt it awfully rash of you to come here and
run all this risk just to come to Bella Barness wedding I believe I
ought to be jealous of that girl

All Starlights fault I said but anyhow its through him weve had
this meeting here I was dead against coming all the time and I never
expected things to turn out so lucky as they have done

Will he be here tonight Aileen says very soft and timid like I
almost wished Id stayed away but Gracey here would come Young Cyrus
Williams brought us He wanted to show his wife the races and take her
to the ball There they are dancing together George is away at the
races

You will see Starlight about ten or eleven oclock I expect I said
Hes dining with the Commissioner and the camp officers Theyll all
come together most likely

Dining at the camp says Aileen looking regularly perished You
dont mean to say theyve taken him

I mean what I say Hes here with the Mr Dawsons of Wideview and has
been handandglove with all the swells I hardly think youll know him
Its as much as I did

Poor Aileen gave another sigh

Do you think hell know me she says Oh what a foolish girl I was
to think for a moment that he could care about a girl like me Oh I
wish I had never come

Nonsense says Gracey who looked a deal brighter on it Why if hes
the man you say he is this will only bring him out a bit What do you
think DiI mean Mr Jones

Thats right Miss Storefield says I Keep to the company manners
tonight We dont know who may be listening but Im not much afraid of
being bowled out this particular night Somehow I feel ready to chance
everything for an hours happiness like this

Gracey said nothing but looked down and Aileen kept turning towards
the door as if she half hoped and was half afraid of seeing him come in
By and by we heard some one say Here comes the Commissioner all the
camp will be here now and there was a bit of a move to look at them as
they came in




Chapter 42



A good many gentlemen and ladies that lived in the town and in the
diggings or near it had come before this and had been dancing away and
enjoying themselves though the room was pretty full of diggers and all
sorts of people But as everybody was quiet and well behaved it didnt
make much odds who was there

But of course the Commissioner was the great man of the whole place
and the principal visitors like the Mr Dawsons and some others were
bound to come along with him Then there were the other Government
officers the bankers and surveyors lawyers and doctors and so on All
of them took care to come a little late with their wives and families so
as to be in the room at the same time as the swell lot

Bella Barnes was going to marry a surveyor a wildish young fellow
but a good one to work as ever was She was going to chance his coming
straight afterwards He was a likely man to rise in his office and
she thought shed find a way to keep him out of debt and drinking and
gambling too

Well in comes the Commissioner and his friends very grand indeed all
dressed like swells always do in the evening I believe black all over
white tie shining boots white kid gloves flower in their buttonhole
all regular People may laugh but they did look different from the
othersshowed more blood like I dont care what they say there is
such a thing

Close by the Commissioner laughing and talking was the two Mr
Dawsons andI saw Aileen give a startwho should come next cheek
by jowl with the police magistrate whom hed been making laugh with
something hed said as they came in but Starlight himself looking like
a regular princetheir pictures anyhowand togged out to the nines
like all the rest of em Aileen kept looking at him as he lounged up
the ballroom and I thought shed fall down in a faint or bring herself
to peoples notice by the wild earnest sad way she looked at him
However hed got his clothes and the rest of it that fitted him like as
if theyd been grown for him I couldnt think But of course hed made
all that right when he went to Sydney and had em sent up with his
luggage in Mr Dawsons drag

Though he didnt seem to notice anything I saw that he knew us He
looked round for a moment and smiled at Aileen

Thats a pretty girl he said to one of the young fellows evidently
from the country I must get introduced to her

Oh well introduce you says the other man Theyre not half bad
fun these bush girls some of them

Well a new dance was struck up by the band just after theyd got up to
the top of the room and we saw Starlight taken up and introduced to a
grand lady the wife of the head banker The Commissioner and some of
the other big wigs danced in the same quadrille We all moved a bit
higher to get a good look at him His makeup was wonderful We could
hardly believe our eyes His hair was a deal shorter than he ever wore
it except in one place and hed shaved nearly all but his moustache
That was dark brown and heavy You couldnt see his mouth except when
he smiled and then his teeth were as white as Warrigals nearly and as
regular There was a softness too about his eyes when he was in a good
temper and enjoying himself that I hardly ever saw in a mans face I
could see Aileen watching him when he talked to this lady and that and
sometimes she looked as if she didnt enjoy it

He was only waiting his chance though for after hed had a dance or
two we saw him go up to one of the stewards They had big rosettes on
and presently they walked round to us and the steward asked the favour
of Aileens name and then begged by virtue of his office to present
Lieutenant Lascelles a gentleman lately from India who had expressed
a wish to be introduced to her Such a bow Starlight made too We could
hardly help staring Poor Aileen hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry
when he sat down beside her and asked for the pleasure of a dance

She wouldnt do that She only came there to see him she said and me
but he persuaded her to walk round the room and then they slipped into
one of the supperrooms where they were able to talk without being
disturbed and say what they had in their hearts I got Gracey to take
a turn with me and we were able to have our little say She was like
Aileen miserable enough and afraid to think of our ever having the
chance of getting married and living happy like other people but she
told me she would wait and remain faithful to meif it was to her
lifes endand that as soon as I could get away from the country and
promise her to leave our wild lives behind she was ready to join us and
follow me all over the world Over and over again she tried to persuade
me to get away like Jim and said how happy he was now and how much
better it was than stopping where we were and running terrible risks
every day and every hour It was the old story over again but I felt
better for it and really meant to try and cut loose from all this cross
work We hadnt too much time Aileen was fetched back to her seat and
then Starlight went off to his friends at the other end of the room
and was chaffed for flirting with a regular currency lass by one of the
Dawsons

I admire his taste says the Commissioner I really think shes the
prettiest girl in the room if she was well dressed and had a little more
animation I wonder who she is Whats her name Lascelles I suppose
you know all about her by this time

Her name is Martin or Marston or some such name answered Starlight
quite cool and pleasant Deuced nice sensible girl painfully quiet
though Wouldnt dance though at all and talked very little

By Jove I know who she is says one of the young chaps Thats
Aileen Marston sister to Dick and Jim No wonder she isnt over lively
Why she has two brothers bushrangers regular outandouters Theres
a thousand on each of their heads

Good gad says Starlight you dont say so Poor girl What a most
extraordinary country You meet with surpwises every day dont you

Its a pity Sir Ferdinand isnt here said the Commissioner I
believe shes an acquaintance of his Ive always heard she was a
splendid girl though poor thing frets to death about her family I
think you seem to have cheered her up though Lascelles She doesnt
look half so miserable as she did an hour ago

Naturally my dear fellow says Starlight pulling his moustache
even in this savage countrybeg your pardonones old form seems to
be appreciated Pardon me I must regain my partner I am engaged for
this dance

You seem disposed to make the most of your opportunities says the
Commissioner Dawson youll have to look after your friend Whos the
enslaver now

I didnt quite catch her name says Starlight lazily but its that
tall girl near the pillar with the pale face and dark eyes

Youre not a bad judge for a new chum says one of the goldfield
subs Why thats Maddie Barnes I think shes the pick of all the
downtheriver girls and the best dancer here outandout Her
sisters to be married tomorrow and were all going to see her turned
off

Really now says Starlight putting up his eyeglass I begin to
think I must write a book Im falling upon adventures hourly Oh the
Morgenblatter What a treat Can she valse do you think

You try her says the young fellow Shes a regular stunner

It was a fine large room and the band mostly Germans struck up some
outlandish queer sort of tune that Id never heard anything like before
whatever it was it seemed to suit most of the dancing people for the
floor was pretty soon full up and everybody twisting round and round
as if they were never going to stop But to my mind there was not a
couple there that was a patch on Maddie and Starlight He seemed to
move round twice as light and easy as any one else he looked somehow
different from all the others As for Maddie wherever she picked it up
she went like a bird with a free springy sort of sliding step and all
in time to the music anybody could see After a bit some of the people
sat down and I could hear them passing their remarks and admiring
both of em till the music stopped I couldnt make out whether Aileen
altogether liked it or not anyhow she didnt say anything

About an hour afterwards the camp party left the room and took
Starlight with them Some one said there was a little loo and hazard at
the Commissioners rooms Cyrus Williams was not in a hurry to go home
or his young wife either so I stayed and walked about with the two
girls and we had ever so much talk together and enjoyed ourselves
for once in a quiet way A good crowd was sure to be at Bella Barness
wedding next day It was fixed for two oclock so as not to interfere
with the races The big handicap was to be run at three so we should be
able to be at the church when Bella was turned off and see Rainbow go
for the great race of the day afterwards When that was run we intended
to clear It would be time for us to go then Things were middling
straight but it mightnt last

Next day was the great excitement of the meeting The big money was
all in the handicap and there was a big field with two or three cracks
up from Sydney and a very good local horse that all the diggers were
sweet on It was an open race and every man that had a note or a fiver
laid it out on one horse or another

Rainbow had been entered in proper time and all regular by old Jacob
under the name of Darkie which suited in all ways He was a dark
horse sure enough dark in colour and dark enough as to his
performancesnobody knew much about them We werent going to enter him
in his right name of course

Old Jacob was a queer old fellow in all his ways and notions so we
couldnt stable him in any of the stables in Turon for fear of his
being got at or something So when I wanted to see him the day
before the old fellow grinned and took me away about a mile from the
course and there was old Rainbow snug enoughin a tent above all
placesbut as fine as a star and as fit as ever a horse was brought
to the post

Whats the fun of having him under canvas I said Who ever heard
of a horse being trained in a tent beforenot but what he looks
firstchop

Ive seen horses trained in more ways than one says he and I can
wind em up in the stable and out of it as mighty few in this country
canthat is when I put the muzzle on Theres a deal in knowing the
way horses is brought up Now this heres an excitable hoss in a crowd

Is he I said Why hes as cool and steady as an old trooper
when

When powders burning and bullets is flying says the old chap
grinning again but this heres a different crowd When hes got a
training saddle and seven or eight stone up and theres two or three
hundred horses rattling about this side on him and that it brings out
the old racehorse feeling thats in his blood and never had a chance to
show itself afore

I see and so you want to keep him quiet till the last minute

Thats just it says he Ive got the time to a secondhere he
pulls out a big old turnip of a silver watchand Ill have him up just
ready to be weighed out last I never was late in my life

All right I said but dont draw it too fine Have you got your
weight all right

Right to a hounce says he nine stun four theyve put on him and
him an untried horse I told em it was weighting him out of the race
but they laughed at me Never you mind though he can carry weight and
stay too My ten per cents as safe as the bank Hell put the stuns on
all them nobs too that think a racehorse must always come out of one
of their training stables

Well goodbye old man says I and good luck One of us will come
and lead you into the weighing yard if you pull it off and chance the
odds if Sir Ferdinand himself was at the gate

All right says he Ill look out for you and off he goes I went
back and told Aileen and Gracey and we settled that they were to drive
out to the course with Cyrus Williams and his wife I rode thinking
myself safer on horseback for fear of accidents Starlight of course
went in the Dawsons drag and was going to enjoy himself to the last
minute He had his horse ready at a moments notice and Warrigal was
not far off to give warning or to bring up his horse if we had to ride
for it

Well the first part of the day went well enough and then about
halfpast one we all went down to the church The young fellow that
was to marry Bella Barnes was known on the field and well liked by the
miners so a good many of them made it up to go and see the wedding
Theyd heard of Bella and Maddie and wanted to see what they looked
like

The church was on the side of the town next the racecourse so they
hadnt far to go By and by as the crowd moved that way Starlight says
to the Commissioner

Where are all these good folks making for

Why the fact is theres to be a wedding he says and it excites a
good deal of attention as the young people are well known on the field
and popular Bella Barnes and her sister are very fine girls in their
way Suppose we go and look on too There wont be anything now before
the big race

By Jove a firstrate ideah says Starlight I should like to see an
Australian wedding above all things

This will be the real thing then says Mr Jack Dawson Lets
drive up to our hotel put up the horses have a devil and a glass of
champagne and we can be back easy in time for the race So away they
went Cyrus drove the girls and his wife in his dogcart so we were
there all ready to see the bride come up

It looked a regular grand affair my word The church was that crammed
there was hardly a place to sit or stand in Every woman young and
old in the countryside was there besides hundreds of diggers who sat
patiently waiting as if some wonderful show were going to take place
Aileen and Gracey had come in early and got a pew next to the top
almost I stood outside There was hardly a chance for any one else to
get in

By and by up comes old Jonathan driving a respectablelooking carriage
with his wife and Bella and Maddie all in white silk and satin and
looking splendid Out he gets and takes Bella to walk up the middle of
the church When he went in with Bella Maddie had one look in and it
seemed so crammed full of people that she looked frightened and drew
back Just then up comes the Mr Dawsons and Starlight with the
Commissioner and a few more

Directly he sees Maddie draw back Starlight takes the whole thing in
and walked forward

My dear young lady says he will you permit me to escort you up the
aisle The bride appears to have preceded you

He offered her his arm and if youll believe me the girl didnt know
him a bit in the world and stared at him like a perfect stranger

Its all right Miss Maddie says the Commissioner He had a way
of knowing all the girls as far as a laugh or a bit of chaff went
especially if they were goodlooking Mr Lascelles is an English
gentleman newly arrived and a friend of mine Hes anxious to learn
Australian ways

She took his arm then and walked on never looking at him but quite
shylike till he whispered a word in her ear which brought more colour
into her face than any one had seen there before for a year

My word Lascelles knows how to talk to em says Jack Dawson Hes
given that girl a whip that makes her brighten up What a chap he is
you cant lick him

Pretty fair all round I should say says the other brother Bill
Hullo are we to go on the platform with the parson and the rest of
em

The reason was that as we went up the church all together all in a
heap with the Barneses and the bride they thought we must be related
to em and the church being chokefull they shunted us on to the place
inside the rails where we found ourselves drafted into the small yard
with the bridegroom the bride the parson and all that mob

There wasnt much time to spare what with the racing and the general
bustle of the day The miners gave a sort of buzz of admiration as Bella
and Maddie and the others came up the aisle They looked very well
theres no manner of doubt They were both tallish girls slight but
well put together and had straight features and big bright eyes with
plenty of fun and meaning in em All they wanted was a little more
colour like and between the hurry for time and Bella getting married
a days work that dont come often in any ones life and having about
a thousand people to look at em both the girls were flushed up a good
deal It set them off firstrate I never saw either of them look so
handsome before Old Barnes had come down well for once and they were
dressed in real good stylehadnt overdone it neither

When the tyingup fakement was over everything went off firstrate The
bridegroom was a hardylooking upstanding young chap that looked as
if work was no trouble to him Next to a squatter I think a Government
surveyors the best billet going He can change about from one end of
the district to another He has a good part of his time the regular free
bush life with his camp and his men and the harder he works the more
money he makes Then when he comes back to town he can enjoy himself
and no mistake He is not tied to regular hours like other men in the
service and can go and come when he likes pretty well Old Barnes would
be able to give Bella and her sister a tidy bit of money some day and
if they took care theyd be comfortable enough off after a few years
He might have looked higher but Bella would make any man she took to a
slashing good wife and so she did him So the parson buckles them
to and the last words were said Starlight steps forward and says I
believe its the custom in all circles to salute the bride which I
now do and he gave Bella a kiss before every one in the most high and
mighty and respectful manner just as if he was a prince of the blood
At the same time he says I wish her every happiness and good fortune
in her married life and I beg of her to accept this trifling gift as
a souvenir of the happy occasion Then he pulls off a ring from his
little finger and slips it on hers The sun glittered on it for a
moment We could see the stones shine It was a diamond ring every one
could see Then the Commissioner steps forward and begs to be permitted
the same privilege which made Bella laugh and blush a bit Directly
after Mr Chanewood who had stood quiet enough alongside of his wife
tucked her arm inside of his and walked away down the church as if he
thought this kind of thing was well enough in its way but couldnt be
allowed to last all day

When they got into the carriage and drove off the whole church
was cleared and they got such a cheer as you might have heard at
Tambaroora The parson was the only living soul left near the building
in five minutes Everybody was in such a hurry to get back to the course
and see the big race of the meeting

Starlight slipped away in the crowd from his two friends and managed to
get a quiet few minutes with me and Gracey and Aileen she was scolding
him between jest and earnest for the kissing business and said she
thought he was going to leave off these sort of attentions to other
girls

Not that she knew you at first a bit in the world Aileen said I
watched her face pretty close and Im sure she thought you were some
grand gentleman a friend of the Commissioners and the Mr Dawsons

My dearest girl said he it was a promise I made months since that I
should attend Bellas wedding and I never break my word as I hope
you will find These girls have been good friends and true to us in our
need We all owe them much I dont suppose we shall cross each others
path again

There wasnt much more time We both had to move off He had just time
to catch his drag and I had to get my horse The Dawsons bullied him
a bit for keeping them waiting and swore he had stayed behind to flirt
with some of the girls in the church after the wedding was over

Youre not to be trusted when theres temptation going Jack Dawson
said Saw you talking to that Marston girl If you dont mind youll
have your head knocked off Theyre a rum lot to deal with I can tell
you

I must take care of myself he said laughing I have done so in
other lands and I suppose yours is no exception

This is a dashed queer country in some ways and with deuced strange
people in it too as youll find by the time youve had your colonial
experience says Bill Dawson but there goes the saddlingbell

The course had 20000 people on it now if there was one About a dozen
horses stood stripped for the race and the betting men were yelling out
the odds as we got close enough to the stand to hear them We had a good
look at the lot Three or four goodlooking ones among them and one or
two flyers that had got in light as usual Rainbow was nowhere about
Darkie was on the card but no one seemed to know where he was or
anything about him We expected hed start at 20 to 1 but somehow it
leaked out that he was entered by old Jacob Benton and that acted as
a damper on the layers of the odds Old Jakes generally there or
thereabouts If hes a duffer its the first one hes brought to the
post Why dont the old varmint show up

This was what I heard about and round and we began to get uneasy
ourselves for fear that something might have happened to him or the
horse About 8 or 9 to 1 was all we could get and that we took over and
over again

As the horses came up the straight one after the other having their
pipeopeners youd have thought no race had been run that week to see
the interest all the people took in it My word Australia is a horsey
country and no mistake With the exception of Arabia perhaps as they
tell us about I cant think as theres a country on the face of the
earth where the peoples fonder of horses From the time theyre able to
walk boys and girls theyre able to ride and ride well See the girls
jump on barebacked with nothing but a gunnybag under em and ride
over logs and stones through scrub and forest down gullies or along
the side of a mountain And a horse race dont they love it Wouldnt
they give their souls almostand they do often enoughfor a real
flyer a thoroughbred able to run away from everything in a country
race The horse is a fatal animal to us natives and many a mans ruin
starts from a bit of horseflesh not honestly come by

But our racing aint going forward and the days passing fast As I
said everybody was looking at the horsescoming along with the rush
of the thoroughbred when hes on his top for condition his coat like
satin and his legs like iron There were lots of the bush girls on
horseback and among them I soon picked out Maddie Barnes She was
dressed in a handsome habit and hat How shed had time to put them on
since the wedding I couldnt make out but women manage to dress faster
some times than others Shed wasted no time anyhow

She was mounted on a fine tall upstanding chestnut and Joe Moreton
was riding alongside of her on a goodlooking bay togged out very
superior also Maddie was in one of her larking humours and gave Joe
quite enough to do to keep time with her

I dont see my horse here yet she says to Joe loud enough for me to
hear but she knew enough not to talk to me or pretend to know me I
want to back him for a fiver I hope that old Jacob hasnt gone wrong

What do you call your horse says Joe I didnt know your father had
one in this race

No fear says Maddie only this horse was exercised for a bit near
our place Hes a regular beauty and there isnt a horse in this lot
fit to see the way he goes

Who does he belong to says Joe

Thats a secret at present says she but youll know some day when
youre a bit older if you behave yourself Hes Mr Jacob Bentons
Darkie now and you bet on him to the coat on your back

Ill see what I think of him first says Joe who didnt fancy having
a horse rammed down his throat like that

If you dont like him you dont like me says Maddie So mind that
Joe Moreton

Just as she spoke there was a stir in the crowd and old Jacob came
along across the course leading a horse with a sheet on just as
easygoing as if hed a day to spare One of the stewards rode up to
him and asked him what he meant by being so late

The old chap pulls out his watch Youll stick to your advertised time
wont you Ive time to weigh time to pull off this here sheet and my
overcoat time to mount and a minute to spare I never was late in my
life governor

Most of the riding mob was down with the racehorses a distance or
so from the stand where they was to start the course being over two
miles So the weighing yard and stand was pretty well empty which was
just what old Jacob expected

The old man walks over to the scales and has himself weighed all
regular declaring a pound overweight for fear of accidents He gets
down as quiet and easy as possible to the starting point and just
in time to walk up steadily with the other horses when down goes the
starters flag and Off was the word Starlight and the Dawsons were
down there waiting for him As they went away one of the ringmen says
Ten to one against Darkie I lay Darkie Done says Starlight will
you do it in tens All right says the book Ill take you says
both the Dawsons and he entered their names

Theyd taken all they could get the night before at the hotel and as
no one knew anything about Darkie and he had top weight he hadnt many
backers




Chapter 43



Mr Dawson drove pretty near the stand then and they all stood up in
the drag I went back to Aileen and Gracey Storefield We were close by
the winning post when they came past they had to go another time round

The Sydney horses were first and second the diggers favourite third
but old Rainbow lying well up was coming through the ruck hard held
and looking full of running They passed close by us What a sight it is
to see a dozen blood horses in top condition come past you like a
flash of lightning How their hoofs thunder on the level turf How the
jockeys silk jackets rustle in the wind they make How muscle and
sinew strain as they pretty near fly through the air No wonder us young
fellows and the girls too feel its worth a year of their lives to
go to a good race Yes and will to the worlds end O you darling
Rainbow I heard Aileen say Are you going to win this race and
triumph over all these grand horses What a sight it will be I didnt
think I could have cared for a race so much

It didnt seem hardly any time before they were halfway round again
and the struggle was on in good downright earnest One of the Sydney
horses began to shake his tail The other still kept the lead Then the
Turon favouritea real game pebble of a little horsebegan to show up

Hotspur Hotspur No Bronzewing has itBronzewing Its Bronzewings
race Turon for ever the crowd kept yelling

Oh look at Rainbow says Aileen And just then at the turn old
Jacob sat down on him The old horse challenged Bronzewing passed
him and collared Hotspur Darkie Darkie shouts everybody No
HotspurDarkies comingDarkieDarkie I tell yer Darkie And as
old Jacob made one last effort and landed him a winner by a clear head
there was a roar went up from the whole crowd that might have been heard
at Nulla Mountain

Starlight jumps off the drag and leads the old horse into the weighing
yard The steward says Dismount No fear of old Jacob getting down
before he heard that He takes his saddle in his lap and gets into the
scales Weight says the clerk Then the old fellow mounts and rides
past the judges box I declare Mr Bentons horse Darkie to be the
winner of the Turon Grand Handicap Bronzewing second horse Hotspur
third says he

Well there was great cheering and hollering though none knew exactly
whose horse he was or anything about him but an Australian crowd always
likes to see the best horse winand they like fair playso Darkie was
cheered over and over again and old Jacob too

Aileen stroked and petted him and patted his neck and rubbed his nose
and youd raly thought the old horse knew her he seemed so gentlelike
Then the Commissioner came down and said Mrs Hautley the police
magistrates wife and some other ladies wanted to see the horse that
had won the race So he was taken over there and admired and stroked
till old Jacob got quite crusty

Its an odd thing Dawson says the Commissioner nobody here knows
this horse where he was bred or anything about him Such a grand
animal as he is too I wish Morringer could have seen him hes always
raving about horses How savage hell be to have missed all the fun

Hes a horse you dont see every day says Bill Dawson Ill give a
couple of hundred for him right off

Not for sale at present says old Jacob looking like a castiron
image Ill send ye word when he is

All right says Mr Dawson What a shoulder what legs what loins he
has Ah well hell be weighted out now and you will be glad to sell
him soon

Our heads wont ache then says Jacob as he turns round and rides
away

Very neat animal shows form drawls Starlight Worth three hundred
in the shires for a hunter if he can jump perhaps more but depends on
his mannersmust have manners in the huntingfield Dawson you know

Manners or not says Bill Dawson its my opinion he could have won
that race in a canter I must find out more about him and buy him if I
can

Ill go you halves if you like says Starlight I weally believe him
to be a good animal

Just then up rides Warrigal He looks at the old horse as if he had
never seen him before nor us neither He rides close by the heads of
Mr Dawsons team and as he does so his hat falls off by mistake of
course He jumps off and picks it up and rides slowly down towards the
tent

It was the signal to clear Something was up

I rode back to town with Aileen and Gracey said goodbyea hard matter
it was tooand sloped off to where my horse was and was out of sight
of Turon in twenty minutes

Starlight hails a cabby he told me this afterwards and gets him to
drive him over to the inn where he was staying telling the Dawsons hed
have the wine put in ice for the dinner that he wanted to send off a
letter to Sydney by the post and hed be back on the course in an hour
in good time for the last race

In about halfanhour back comes the same cabman and puts a note into
Bill Dawsons hand He looks at it stares swears a bit and then
crumples it up and puts it into his pocket

Just as it was getting dark and the last race just run back comes
Sir Ferdinand and all the police Theyd ridden hard as their horses
showed and Sir Ferdinand they say didnt look half as goodnatured as
he generally did

Youve lost a great meeting Morringer says the Commissioner Great
pity you had to be off just when you did But thats just like these
infernal scoundrels of bushrangers They always play up at the most
inconvenient time How did you get on with them

Get on with them roars Sir Ferdinand almost making a hole in his
mannershe was that tired out and done he could hardly sit on his
horsewhy weve been sold as clean as a whistle I believe some of
the brutes have been here all the time

Thats impossible says the Commissioner Theres been no one here
that the police are acquainted with not that I suppose Jackson and
Murphy know many of the cross boys

No strange men nor horses no disguises says Sir Ferdinand Here he
brings out a crumpled bit of paper written on


 If sur firdnand makes haist back heel be in time to see Starlites
 Raneboe win the handy capp
 BILLY THE BOY


I firmly believe that young scoundrel who will be hanged yet strung
us on after Moran ever so far down south just to leave the coast clear
for the Marstons and then sent me this too late to be of any use

Quite likely But the Marstons couldnt be here let alone Starlight
unlessby Jove but thats impossible Impossible Whew Here Jack
Dawson wheres your Indian friend

Gone back to the inn Couldnt stand the course after the handicap
Youre to dine with us Commissioner you too Scott kept a place Sir
Ferdinand for you on the chance

One moment pardon me Whos your friend

Name Lascelles Just from homecame by India Splendid fellow Backed
Darkie for the handicapwe did toowon a pot of money

What sort of a horse is this Darkie

Very grand animal Old fellow had him in a tent about a mile down the
creek dark bay star in forehead Havent seen such a horse for years
Like the old Emigrant lot

Sir Ferdinand beckoned to a senior constable

Theres a tent down there near the creek I think you said Dawson
Bring up the racehorse you find there and any one in charge

And now I think Ill drive in with you Dawson dismounting and
handing his horse to a trooper I suppose a decent dinner will pick
me up though I feel just as much inclined to hang myself as do anything
else at present I should like to meet this travelled friend of yours
strangers are most agreeable

Sir Ferdinand was right in thinking it was hardly worth while going
through the form of seeing whether we had waited for him Lieutenant
Lascelles on leave from his regiment in India had taken French leave
When inquiry was made at the hotel where dinner had been ordered by
Mr Dawson and covers laid for a dozen he had just stepped out No one
seemed to know exactly where to find him The hotel people thought he
was with the Mr Dawsons and they thought he was at the hotel When
they surrounded the tent and then rushed it all that it contained was
the body of old Jacob Benton lying dead drunk on the floor A horserug
was over him his racing saddle under his head and his pockets stuffed
with fivepound notes He had won his race and got his money so he was
not bound in honour to keep sober a minute longer

Rainbow was gone and there was nothing to be got out of him as to who
had taken him or which way he had gone Nobody seemed to have dropped
to me I might have stayed at Turon longer if Id liked But it wasnt
good enough by a long way

We rode away straight home and didnt lose time on the road you bet
Not outandout fast either there was no need for that We had a
clear two hours start of the police and their horses were pretty well
knocked up by the pace theyd come home at so they werent likely to
overhaul us easy

It was a grand night and though we didnt feel up to much in the way
of talking it wasnt bad in its way Starlight rode Rainbow of course
and the old horse sailed away as if a hundred miles or a thousand made
no odds to him

Warrigal led the way in front He always went as straight as a line
just the same as if hed had a compass in his forehead We never had any
bother about the road when he led the way

Theres nothing like adventure says Starlight at last As some one
says who would have thought we should have come out so well Fortune
favours the brave in a general way theres no doubt By George what
a comfort it was to feel ones self a gentleman again and to associate
with ones equals Ha ha how savage Sir Ferdinand is by this time and
the Commissioner As for the Dawsons theyll make a joke of it Fancy
my dining at the camp Its about the best practical joke I ever carried
out and Ive been in a good many

The luckiest turn weve ever had says I I never expected to see
Gracey and Aileen there much less to go to a ball with them and no one
to say no It beats the world

It makes it all the rougher going back thats the worst of it says
he Good God what fools idiots raving lunatics weve all been
Why but for our own infernal folly should we be forced to shun our
fellowmen and hide from the light like beasts of prey What are we
better Betternay a hundred times worse Some day I shall shoot
myself I know I shall What a muff Sir Ferdinand must be hes missed
me twice already

Here he rode on and never opened his mouth again till we began to rise
the slope at the foot of Nulla Mountain When the dark fit was on him
it was no use talking to him Hed either not seem to hear you or else
hed say something which made you sorry for opening your mouth at all
It gave us all we could do to keep along with him He never seemed to
look where he was going and rode as if he had a spare neck at any rate
When we got near the pass to the mountain I called out to him that hed
better pull up and get off Do you think hed stop or make a sign he
heard me Not a bit of it He just started the old horse down when
he came to the path in the cliff as if it was the easiest road in the
world He kept staring straight before him while the horse put down his
feet as if it was regular good fun treading up rugged sharp rocks and
rolling stones and turf wasnt worth going over It seemed to me as if
he wanted to kill himself for some reason or other It would have been
easy enough with some horses but you could have ridden Rainbow down the
roof of a house and jumped him into the front balcony I firmly believe
You couldnt throw him down if hed dropped into a well hed have gone
in straight and landed on his legs

Dad was glad enough to see us he was almost civil and when he heard
that Rainbow had won the big money he laughed till I thought hed do
himself mischief not being used to it He made us tell him over again
about Starlight and I going to the ball and our seeing Aileen and
Gracey there and when he came to the part where Starlight made the
bride a present of a diamond ring I thought he never would have done
chuckling to himself Even old Crib looked at me as if he didnt use to
think me much of a fellow but after this racket had changed his mind

Wont there be a jolly row in the papers when they get all these
different characters played by one chap and that man the Captain says
he I knew he was clever enough for anything but this beats all I
dont believe now Captain youll ever be took

Not alive says Starlight rather grim and gloomylooking then he
walks off by himself

We stabled Rainbow of course for a week or two after thisbeing in
training it wouldnt do to turn him out straight at once Hardy as he
was no horse could stand that altogether so we kept him under shelter
in a roughish kind of a loose box we had knocked up and fed him on
bush hay We had a small stack of that in case we wanted to keep a horse
inwhich we did sometimes In the daytime he was loose in the yard
After a bit when he was used to the weather he was turned out again
with his old mob and was never a hair the worse of it We took it easy
ourselves and sent out Warrigal for the letters and papers We expected
to knock a good bit of fun out of them when they came

Sure enough there was the deuce and all to pay when the big Sydney
papers got hold of it as well as the little Turon Star and the
Banner


Was it true that the police had again been hoodwinked justice derided
and the law set at defiance by a gang of ruffians who would have been
run down in a fortnight had the police force been equal to the task
entrusted to them Was the moral sentiment of the country population so
perverted so obliterated that robbers and murderers could find safe
harbourage trustworthy friends and secret intelligence Could they
openly show themselves in places of public resort mingle in amusements
and frequent the company of unblemished and distinguished citizens and
yet more after this flagrant insult to the Government of the land to
every sacred principle of law and order they could disappear at will
apparently invisible and invulnerable to the officers of the peace and
the guardians of the public safety It was incredible it was monstrous
degrading nay intolerable and a remedy would have to be found
either in the reorganisation of an inefficient police force or in the
resignation of an incapable Ministry


Good for the Sydney Monitor says Starlight that reporter knows
how to doubleshot his guns and winds up with a broadside Let us see
what the Star says I had a bet with the editor and paid it as it
happened Perhaps hell temper justice with mercy Now for a start


That we have had strong casts from time to time and exciting
performances at our local theatres no one will deny but perhaps the
inhabitants of Turon never witnessed a more enthralling melodrama
than was played during the first two days of our race meeting before a
crowded and critical audience and never we can state from a somewhat
extended experience of matters dramatic did they gaze on a more
finished actor than the gentleman who performed the leading part
Celebrated personages have ere now graced our provincial boards On the
occasion of the burning of the Theatre Royal in Sydney we were favoured
with the presence in our midst of artists who rarely if ever before
had quitted the metropolitan stage But our jeune premier in one sense
has eclipsed every darling of the tragic or the comic muse

Where is there a member of the profession who could have sustained his
part with faultless ease and selfpossession being the whole time aware
of the fact that he smiled and conversed danced and diced dined and
slept ye gods did he sleep with a price upon his headwith the
terrible doom of dishonour and inevitable death hanging over him
consequent upon a detection which might occur at any moment

Yet was there a stranger guest among us who did all this and more with
unblenching brow unruffled selfpossession unequalled courtesy who
if discovered would have been arrested and consigned to a lockup only
to be exchanged for the gloom and the manacles of the condemned cell
He indeed after taking a prominent part in all the humours of the
vast social gathering by which the Turon miners celebrated their annual
games disappeared with the almost magical mystery which has already
marked his proceedings

Whom could we possibly allude to but the celebrated the illustrious
we grieve to be compelled to add the notorious Starlight the hero of a
hundred legends the Australian Claude Duval

Yes almost incredible as it may seem to our readers and persons at
a distance imperfectly acquainted with exceptional phases of colonial
life the robber chief and for all we know more than one of his
aidesdecamp was among us foremost among the betting men the
observed of all observers in the grand stand where with those popular
country gentlemen the Messrs Dawson he cheered the winners in the two
great races both of which with demoniac luck he had backed heavily

We narrate as a plain unvarnished truth that this accomplished and
semihistorical personage raced a horse of his own which turns out now
to have been the famous Rainbow an animal of such marvellous speed
courage and endurance that as many legends are current about him as
of Dick Turpins wellknown steed He attended the marriage in St
Matthews Church of Miss Isabel Barnes the daughter of our respected
neighbour Mr Jonathan Barnes when he presented the bride with a
costly and beautiful diamond ring completing the round of his vagaries
by dining on invitation with the Commissioner at the camp mess and
with that high official honouring our race ball with his presence and
sunning himself in the smiles of our fairest maidens

We are afraid that we shall have exhausted the fund of human credulity
and added a fresh and original chapter to those tales of mystery
and imagination of which the late Edgar Allan Poe was so masterly a
delineator

More familiarly rendered it seems that the fascinating Captain
Starlightas mild a mannered man like Lambre as ever scuttled
a ship or cut a throat presented himself opportunely at one of the
mountain hostelries to the notice of our goodhearted squires of
Wideview Messrs William and John Dawson One of their wheelers lay at
the point of deatha horse of great valuewhen the agreeable stranger
suggested a remedy which effected a sudden cure

With all their generous instincts stirred the Messrs Dawson invited
the gentleman to take a seat in their wellappointed drag He introduced
himself as Mr Lascelles holding a commission in an Indian regiment of
Irregular Horse and now on leave travelling chiefly for health

Just sufficiently sunburned perfect in manner full of information
humorous and original in conversation and with all the prestige of
the unknown small wonder that The Captain was regarded as a prize
socially considered and introduced right and left Ha ha What a
most excellent jest albeit rather keen as far as Sir Ferdinand is
concerned We shall never never cease to recall the humorous side of
the whole affair Why we ourselves our august editorial self actually
had a bet in the stand with the audacious pretender and won it too
Did he pay up Of course he did A pony to wit and on the nail He
does nothing by halves notre capitaine We have been less promptly
reimbursed indeed not paid at all by gentlemen boasting a fairer
record How graciously he smiled and bowed as with his primrose kid
gloves he disengaged the two tenners and a fivepound note from his
wellfilled receptacle

The last time we had seen him was in the dock at Nomah being tried in
the great cattle case that cause celebre To do him justice he was
quite as cool and unconcerned there and looked as if he was doing the
amateur casual business without ulterior liabilities

Adieu fare thee well Starlight bold Rover of the Waste we feel
inclined to echo the lament of the ancient Lord Douglas

 Tis pity of him too he cried
 Bold can he speak and fairly ride
 I warrant him a warrior tried

It is in the interests of justice doubtless that thou be hunted down
and expiate by deathdoom the crimes which thou and thy myrmidons have
committed against society in the sight of God and man But we cannot
for the life of us take a keen interest in thy capture We owe thee
much Starlight many a slashing leader many a spicy paragraph many a
stately reflection on contemporary morals hast thou furnished us with
Shall we haste to the slaughter of the rarest birdgolden ovaried We
trow not Get thee to the wilderness and repent thee of thy sins Why
should we judge thee Thou hast if such dubious donation may avail an
editors blessing Depart and stick up no more


Well done the Turon Star says Starlight after he read it all out
I call that very fair Theres a flavour of good feeling underneath
much of that nonsense as well as of porter and oysters It does a
fellow a deal more good than slanging him to believe that hes human
after all and that men think so

Do you reckon that chap was sober when he wrote that says father
Blest if I can make head or tail of it Half what them fellows puts
down is regular rot Why couldnt he have cut it a bit shorter too




Chapter 44



The Banner comes next says Starlight tearing it open We shall
have something short and sweet after the Star Hows this


 STARLIGHT AGAIN

This mercurial brigand it would appear has paid Turon another visit
but with the exception of what may be considered the legalised robbery
of the betting ring has not levied contributions Rather the other way
indeed A hasty note for Mr Dawson whom he had tricked into temporary
association by adopting one of the disguises he can so wonderfully
assume requested that gentleman to receive the Handicap Stakes won by
his horse Darkie alias Rainbow and to hand them over to the treasurer
of the Turon Hospital which was accordingly done

Sir Ferdinand and the police had been decoyed away previously nearly
100 miles by false intelligence as to Moran and his gang Our town and
treasure were thus left undefended for fortyeight hours while a daring
criminal and his associates mingled unsuspected with all classes We
have always regarded the present systemfacetiously called police
protectionas a farce This latter fiasco will probably confirm the
idea with the public at large We unlike a contemporary have no morbid
sympathy with crimeembroidered or otherwise our wishes as loyal
subjects are confined to a short shrift and a high gallows for all who
dare to obstruct the Queens highway


Thats easy to understand barrin a word here and there says father
taking his pipe out of his mouth and laying it down thats the way
they used to talk to us in the old days Dashed if I dont think its
the best way after all You know where you are The rests flummery All
on us as takes to the cross does it with our eyes open and deserves all
we gets

Im afraid youre right governor but why didnt these moral ideas
occur to you for instance and others earlier in life

Why says father getting up and glaring with his eyes because I
was a blind ignorant dog when I was young as had never been taught
nothing and knowed nothing not so much as him there pointing to
Crib for he knows what his business is and I didnt I was thrashed
and starved locked up in a gaol chained and flogged after that and
half the time for doing what I didnt know was wrong and couldnt know
more than one of them fouryearold colts out there that knocks his head
agin the yard when hes roped and falls backards and breaks his neck if
he aint watched Whose business was it to have learned me better That
I cant rightly say but it seemed it was the business of the Government
people to gaol me and iron me and flog me Was that justice Any mans
sense ll tell him it wasnt Its been them and me for it since I got
my liberty and if I had had a dozen lives theyd all have gone the same
road

We none of us felt in the humour to say much after that Father had got
into one of his tantrums and when he did he was fit to be tied only
Id not have took the contract for something Whatever it was that had
happened to him in the old times when he was a Government man he didnt
talk about Only every now and then hed let out just as he did now as
if nothing could ever set him straight again or keep him from fighting
against them as he called the swells and the Government and everybody
almost that was straightgoing and honest Hed been at it a good many
years one way and another and any one that knew him didnt think it
likely hed change

The next dust we got into was all along of a Mr Knightley who lived a
good way down to the south and it was one of the worst things we ever
were mixed up in After the Turon races and all that shine somehow or
other we found that things had been made hotter for us than ever since
we first turned out Go where we would we found the police always quick
on our trail and we had two or three very close shaves of it It looked
as if our luck was dead out and we began to think our chance of getting
across the border to Queensland and clear out of the colony that way
looked worse every day

Dad kept foraging about to get information and we sent Warrigal and
Billy the Boy all over the country to find out how it was things were
turning out so contrary

Sir Ferdinand was always on the move but we knew he couldnt do it all
himself unless he got the office from some one who knew the ropes better
than he did

Last of all we dropped on to it

There was one of the goldfields commissioners a Mr Knightley a very
keen cool hand he was a great sporting man and a dead shot like Mr
Hamilton Well this gentleman took it into his head to put on extra
steam and try and run us down Hed lost some gold by us in the escort
robbery and not forgotten it so it seems hed been trying his best to
fit us ever since Just at first he wasnt able for much but later on
he managed to get information about us and our beat whenever we left
the Hollow and he put two and two together and very nearly dropped on
us as I said before two or three times We heard too that he should
say hed never rest till he had Starlight and the Marstons and that
if he could get picked police hed bring us in within a month dead or
alive

We didnt care much about blowing of this sort in a general way but
one of dads telegraphs sent word in that Mr Knightley had a couple of
thousand pounds worth of gold from a new diggings lodged at his private
residence for a few days till he could get the escort to call for it
that there was only him and a German doctor a great scholar he was
named Schiller in the house

Moran and Daly knew about this and they were dead on for sticking up
the place and getting hold of the gold Besides that we felt savage
about his trying to run us in Of course it was his duty and that of
all magistrates and commissioners in a general way But he wasnt an
officer of police and we thought he was going outside of his line
So when all came to all we made up our minds to learn him a lesson to
stick to his own work besides a thousand ounces of gold was no foolish
touch and we could kill two birds with one stone Moran Daly and
Joe Wall were to be in it besides We didnt like working with them
Starlight and I were dead against it But we knew theyd tackle it by
themselves if we backed out So we agreed to make one thing of it
We were to meet at a place about ten miles off and ride over there
together

Just about ten oclock we closed in on the place and left Billy the Boy
and Warrigal with the horses while we sneaked up We couldnt get near
though without his knowing it for he always had a lot of sporting
dogspointers retrievers kangaroo dogs no end They kicked up a
deuce of a row and barked and howled enough to raise the dead before
we got within a quarter of a mile from the house

Of course he was on his guard then and before long the bullets began to
fly pretty thick among us and we had to take cover to return fire and
keep as dark as we could No doubt this Dr Schiller loaded the guns and
handed them to him else he couldnt have made such play as he did

We blazed away too and as there was no stable at the back we surrounded
the house and tried hard to find an opening Devil a chance there seemed
to be none of us dared show So sure as we did we could hear one of
those Winchester rifle bullets sing through the air almost on the top
of us We all had a close shave more than once for being too fast

For more than half the night he kept cannonading away and we didnt
seem able to get any nearer the place At last we drew lots which should
try and get up close to the place so as to make a rush while we poured
in our broadside and open a door to let us in

The lot fell upon Patsey Daly Goodbye all he said Im dashed if
I dont think Knightley will bag me I dont half like charging him and
thats Gods truth Anyhow Ill try for that barrel there and if I get
behind it I can fire from short range and make him come out

He made a rush half on his hands and knees and managed to get behind
this barrel where he was safe from being hit as long as he kept well
behind it Then he peppered away right and left

On the left of the verandah there was a door stood partly open
and after a bit a man in a light overcoat and a white hat like Mr
Knightley always wore showed himself for a second Daly raps away at
this and the man staggers and falls Patsey shows himself for a moment
from behind the cask thinking to make a rush forward that minute Mr
Knightley who was watching him from a window the other was only an
image lets drive at him cool and steady and poor Patsey drops like a
cock and never raised his head again He was shot through the body He
lingered a bit but in less than an hour he was a dead man

We began to think at last that we had got in for a hot thing and
that we should have to drop it like Morans mob at Kadombla However
Starlight was one of those men that wont be beat and he kept getting
more and more determined to score He crept away to the back of the
building where he could see to fire at a top window close by where the
doctor and Mr Knightley had been potting at us

He had the repeating rifle hed won from me he never let it go
afterwards and he could make wonderful shooting with it He kept it
going so lively that they began to be hard pressed inside and had to
fire away twice as much ammunition as they otherwise would It always
beat me how they contrived to defend so many points at once We tried
back and front doors and windows Twenty times we tried a rush but
they were always readyso it seemedand their fire was too hot for us
to stand up to unless we wanted to lose every second man

The shooting was very close Nearly every one of us had a
scratchStarlight rather the worst as he was more in the front and
showed himself more His left arm was bleeding pretty free but he tied
a handkerchief over it and went on as if nothing had happened only I
could see that his face had that set look he only got now and then and
his eyes began to show out a fierce light

At last we began to see that the return fire was slacking off while
ours was as brisk as ever

Hurrah says Starlight I believe theyll give in soon If they had
any cartridges they would have had every man of us in that last rush
Lets try another dodge Here goes for a batteringram Dick

He pointed to a long heavy sapling which had been fetched in for a
sleeper or something of that sort We picked it up and taking a run
back brought it with all its weight against the front door In it
went like a sheet of bark we almost fell as we ran forward and found
ourselves in a big dark hall It seemed very queer and strange
everything was so silent and quiet

We half expected another volley But nothing came We could only stand
and wait The others had gone round the side of the house

Get to a corner Dick theyre always the safest places We must mind
it isnt an ambush What the devils the matter Are they going to
suicide like the people in the round tower of Jhansi

There are no women here I said Theres no saying what Mr Knightley
might do if his wife had been here

Thank God shes away at Bathurst said Starlight I hate seeing
women put out Besides everybody bows down to Mrs Knightley Shes as
good as shes handsome I believe and thats saying a great deal

Just then Moran and Wall managed to find their way into the other side
of the house and they came tearing into the hall like a pair of colts
They looked rather queer when they saw us three and no one else

What in thunders up says Moran Are they all gone to bed and left
us the spare rooms Poor Patsey wont want one anyhow

Better make some search upstairs says Starlight Wholl go first
You make a start Moran you like fighting people

Couldnt think of going before the Captain says Moran with a grin
Ill follow where you lead

All right says Starlight here goes and he started to walk
upstairs when all of a sudden he stopped and looked up as if something
had surprised him above a bit Then he stepped back and waited I
noticed he took off his hat and leaned against the wall

It was an oldfashioned house for that part of the world built a good
many years ago by a rich settler who was once the owner of all that
side of the country The staircase was all stone ornamented every way
it could be Three or four people could walk abreast easy enough

Just about halfway up was a broad landing and on this all of a
sudden appeared four people inclined by their ways to come down to
where we were while we were all wondering for a reason youll see
afterwards

It was Mr Knightley who took the ladys armit was his wife and she
had been there all the time firing at us as like as not or at any
rate helping The others followed and they all walked quite solemn and
steadylike down the stairs together

It was a strange sight There we were standing and leaning about the
dark hall staring and wondering and these people walking down to meet
us like ghosts without speaking or anything else

Mr Knightley was a tall handsome man with a grand black beard that
came down to his chest He walked like a lord and had that kind of
manner with him that comes to people that have always been used to be
waited on and have everything found for them in this world As for
his wife she was given in to be the handsomest woman in the whole
countrysidetall and graceful with a beautiful smile and soft fair
hair Everybody liked and respected her gentle and simpleeverybody
had a good word for her You couldnt have got any one to say different
for a hundred pounds There are some people here and there like this
among the gentlefolk and say what you like it does more to make coves
like us look a little closer at things and keep away from whats wrong
and bad than all the parsons talk twice over Mrs Knightley was the
only woman that ever put me in mind of Miss Falkland and I cant say
more than that

So as I said before it was quite a picture to see them walk slowly and
proudly down and sweep into the hall as if theyd been marching into a
ballroom We had both seen them at the ball at the Turon and everybody
agreed they were the handsomest couple there

Now they were entering their own hall in a different way But you
couldnt have told much of what they felt by their faces He was a proud
man and felt bitterly enough that he had to surrender to a gang of
men that he hated and despised that hed boasted he could run down and
capture in a month Now the tables were turned He and his beautiful
wife were in our power and to make matters worse one of our band lay
dead beside the inner wall killed by his hand

What was to be his doom And who could say how such a play might end

I looked at our men As they stepped on to the floor of the hall and
looked round Mrs Knightley smiled She looked to me like an angel from
heaven that had come by chance into the other place and hadnt found
out her mistake I saw Starlight start as he looked at her He was still
leaning against the wall and there was a soft sorrowful look in his
eyes like I remember noticing once before while he was talking to
Aileen about his early days a thing he never did but once Part of her
hair had straggled down and hung in a sort of ringlet by her face It
was pale but clear and brightlooking and there was a thin streak
of blood across her forehead that showed as she came underneath the
lamplight from the landing above

I looked over at Moran He and Wall sat in a corner looking as grim
and savage as possible while his deadly black eyes had a kind of gloomy
fire in them that made him look like a wild beast in a cage

Mr Knightley was a man that always had the first word in everything
and generally the best of an argumentputting down anybody who differed
from him in a quiet superior sort of way

He began now Well my men I have come down to surrender and Im
sorry to be obliged to do so But we have fired our last cartridgethe
doctor thought we had a thousand leftin which case I may as well tell
you youd never have had this pleasure Captain Starlight I surrender
my swordor should do so if I had one We trust to receive honourable
treatment at your hands

Im sure the Captain will never permit any harm to come to me says
Mrs Knightley with a look in her eyes that in spite of herself said
a deal more than words Why I danced visavis to him in a quadrille
at the Turon ball

I shall never forget the honour says Starlight walking forward and
bowing low Permit me to offer you a chair madam you look faint

As he did so she sank down in it and really looked as if she would
faint away It wouldnt have been much wonder if she had after what
shed gone through that night

Then Mr Knightley began again He wanted to know how he stood He
didnt like the look of Moran and Wallthey were a deal too quiet for
him and he could read mens faces like a book The other two prisoners
were the German Dr Schillera plucky old chap whod been a rebel and
a conspirator and I dont know what all in his own country Hed seen
too much of that kind of thing to trouble himself over much about a
trifle of this kind The old woman was a family servant who had been
with them for years and years She was a kind of worshipper of theirs
and was ready to live or die with her mistress




Chapter 45



So Mr Knightley stood up and faced them all like a man He was one
of those chaps that makes up their mind pretty quick about the sort of
people theyve got to deal with and if theres anything to be said
or done lets em have it straight from the shoulder As he stood
therestraight and squarewith his head thrown back and his
eyesvery bright and sharp they werelooking every mans face over as
if he was reading a notice and had no time to spare you couldnt have
told from his look or voice or manner whether he was afraid that
things would go wrong or whether he was dead sure theyd go right
Some men are like that Others you can tell every thought thats passing
through their minds just as if it was printed in big letters on their
breasts like a handbill 200 Pounds reward and so on

Well Mr Knightley wasnt one of that sort though I saw him keep his
eye a trifle longer on Moran than the rest of em

Now then boys he says weve had our flutter out Ive done my
best and youve done yours Ive bagged one of your lot and youve
done your best to pot me See here and he lifts up the collar of his
coat and shows a hole through it touches his head on the side and
brings away a red mark and takes out his watch with the case all
battered in by a revolver bullet You cant say I hadnt cause to
show fight and he points to his wife Wheres the man among you that
wouldnt have done the same An Englishmans house is his castle What
am I to expect

He looked over at Starlight but he didnt take no notice and made no
sign I saw Mrs Knightley look over at him too It was the first time
I ever seen him look hard when there was a woman in the case and such a
one But he kept his face set and sternlike

Then Moran breaks in

Expect be blowed What thedo you expect now weve got yer to
rights are we going to let you off after knocking over Daly No dashed
fear mister well serve you the same way as you served him as soon
as weve had some grub and another glass or two of your grog Youve got
some fairish stuff here

Why Moran says Mr Knightley still making believe to jokeand
by George if he could laugh then he could sing a song with a
bullet through himyoure getting badtempered since you used to be
horsebreaking for Mr Lowe Dont you remember that chestnut Sir Henry
colt that no one else could ride and I backed you not to get thrown
and won a fiver But Im a man of the world and know how to play a
losing game at billiards as well as most men Look here now Dalys
dead We cant bring him to life again can we If you shoot me youll
be nothing to the good and have every spare man in the three colonies
at your heels This is a game of brag though the stakes are high Ill
play a card Listen You shall have a hundred fivers500 Pounds in
notesby tomorrow at four oclock if youll let Mrs Knightley and
the doctor ride to Bathurst for the money What do you say

Dn you and your money too growled Moran Well have your blood
and nothing else Dye hear that Youre a dead man now if youre not
buried by this time tomorrow it wont be because youre not as ready
for it as Patsey is

I saw Mrs Knightley turn round and clasp her hands her face grew as
white as death but she said nothing only looked over at Starlight and
her eyes grew bigger and bigger while her mouth trembled just the least
bit

Youre off your head Moran says Mr Knightley pulling out a cigar
and lighting it But I suppose youre the chief man and all the rest
must do as you tell them

Suppose we talk it over says Starlight very quiet but I knew by
the first word that he spoke something was coming Daly dropped and
it cant be helped Accidents will happen If you play at bowls you must
take rubbers It has been a fair fight no one can say otherwise Let
us put it to the vote I propose that Mr Knightleys offer be accepted
Not that I intend to take a shilling of the money

Nor me either says I So you three chaps will have it to share
between you I dont see that we can do better A fights a fight and
if Patsey got his gruel it might have happened to Mr Knightley himself
As for shooting in cold blood Im not on and so I tell you

I suppose you think you and Starlights going to boss the lot of us
because youve been doing it fine at the Turon races along with a lot of
blasted swells as ud scrag us if they had the chance and were to take
so much a head for our dashed lives because were only working chaps
Not if Dan Moran knows it What we want is satisfactionblood for
bloodand were agoin to have it eh mates

Wall and Hulbert hadnt said anything before this They were not bad
chaps underneath but Moran was such a devil when he was raised
that they didnt like to cross him Besides they had a down on Mr
Knightley and wanted to sheet it home to him somehow They had got to
the brandy too and it didnt make matters any better you take my word
for it

Starlight didnt speak for a minute or two I couldnt think what he was
at If Jim had been there we should have been right three to three Now
we were two to three I knew Starlight had a good card to play and was
ready to play it but he was waiting on the deal Mr Knightley must
have had some sort of notion of the hand he was wonderful quick at
picking up the points of the game

He said nothing and looked as cool as you please smoking his cigar
as if he had nothing on his mind and wanted a rest The lady sat quite
still and pale but her beautiful eyes kept wandering round from one to
another like some pretty creature caught in a trap Dr Schiller found
it hard lines on him to keep quiet all this timehe couldnt hold it in
no longer

Good heafens he says are you men and will not say nodings when you
haf such an ovver as dis Subbose you shood us all what then Will not
the whole coundry rice and hund you down like mat docks

That wont make it any better for you mate says Moran with a grin
When you and hes lying under that old tree outside itll make no odds
to yer whether our ropes a long or a short un

Quite right Moran says Mr Knightley Doctor he has you there

Starlight moved a step or two over towards him as if he was uncertain
in his mind Then he says to Wall and Hulbert

See here men youve heard what Moran says and what I think Which
are you going to do To help in a brutal cowardly murder and never
be able to look a man in the face again or to take this money
tomorrowa hundred and seventy each in notes mind and get away
quietlyor are you going to be led by Moran and told what you are to
do like children

Oh come Dan lets take the stuff says Wall I think its good
enough Whats the use of being contrary I think the Captains right
He knows a dashed sight more than us

He be hanged says Moran with eyes glaring and the whole of his face
working like a man in a fit Hes no Captain of mine and never was
Ill never stir from here till I have payment in blood for Dalys life
We may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb Ive sworn to have that
mans life tonight and have it I will

Youll have ours first you bloodthirsty murdering dog says
Starlight and as he spoke he slipped his revolver into Mr
Knightleys hand who covered Moran that moment I drew mine too and
had Wall under aim Starlights repeating rifle was up like lightning

Mrs Knightley covered her eyes the old woman screamed and the doctor
sat down on a chair and puffed away at his meerschaum pipe

Were three to three now says Starlight youve only to move a
finger and youre a dead man Wall and Hulbert can have a hand in it
if they havent had shooting enough for one evening Do your worst you
blackhearted brute Ive two minds to take you and run you in myself
if its only to give you a lesson in manners

Morans face grew as black as an ironbark tree after a bush fire He
raised his revolver and in one second we should have been in the middle
of a desperate handtohand fight and God knows how it might have ended
hadnt Hulbert struck up his arm and spoke out like a man

Its no use Dan we wont stand it Youre a dashed fool and want to
spoil everything for a bit of temper Well take the notes and let Mrs
Knightley and the doctor clear out for Bathurst if youll say honour
bright that youll be at the Black Stump by tomorrow evening at five
and wont give the police the office

Moran slow and sulkily put down his hand and glared round like a dingo
with the dogs round himas if he didnt know which to snap at first
Then he looked at Mr Knightley with a look of hellish rage and spite
that ten devils couldnt have improved upon and throwing himself down
on a chair drank off half a tumbler of brandy

Settle it amongst yourselves and beto you he said Youre all
agin me now but by Ill be square with some of ye yet

It was all over now Mr Knightley took a match out of the silver
matchbox at his watchchain and lit another cigar I saw the tears
trickling through Mrs Knightleys fingers Then she turned away her
head and after a minute or two was as calm and quiet as ever

You know your way about the place Wall says Mr Knightley as if
he was in his own house just the same as usual run up the horses
theres a good fellow theyre in the little horse paddock Mrs
Knightleys is a gray and the doctors is a mousecoloured mare with
a short tail you cant mistake them The sooner theyre off the sooner
youll handle the cash

Wall looked rather amused but went out and we heard him rattle off
to go round the paddock The doctor went upstairs and buckled on a
longnecked pair of oldfashioned spurs and Mrs Knightley walked away
like a woman in a dream to her own room and soon afterwards returned in
her ridinghabit and hat

I foraged about and found the sidesaddle and bridle in the
harnessroom Everything was in tiptop order thereglass sides for
keeping the dust off the fourinhand harness and all that kind of
thing All the bits and stirrupirons like silver There wasnt much
time lost in saddlingup you bet

We watched pretty close lest Moran should take a new fancy into his
head but he stuck to the brandy bottle and very soon put himself from
fighting or anything else I wasnt sorry to see it I was well aware he
was as treacherous as a dingo and could sham dead or anything else to
gain his ends and throw people off their guards

Well the horses were brought out and when Mr Knightley lifted his
wife up on to her saddle on the highcrested gray thoroughbred with a
dash of Arab blood from an old Satellite strain I guess he was never
better pleased with anything in the world They looked in each others
eyes for a minute and then the old horse started off along the road
to Bathurst with his fast springy walk Starlight took off his hat
and bowed low in the most respectful way Mrs Knightley turned in her
saddle and tried to say something but the words wouldnt comeshe
could only wave her handand then her head went down nearly to her
saddle The doctor scrambled on to his horses back and trotted off
after her The gray moved off shaking his head at a beautiful easy
springy canter We raised a cheer and they swept round a corner of the
road and out of sight

Youll find these rather good Captain says Mr Knightley handing
Starlight his cigarcase Theres a box upstairs in my dressingroom
If youll allow me Ill order in dinner There ought to be something
decent if my old cook hasnt been frightened out of his life but
I think he has seen too much to be put out of his way by a little
shooting

Now I think of it says Starlight I do really feel disposed for
refreshment I say Wall see if you cant get that ferocious friend
of yours into a room where he can sleep off his liquor I really must
apologise for his bad manners but you see how the case stands

Perfectly my dear fellow says Mr Knightley Dont mention it I
shall always feel personally indebted to you for far more than I can
express But let that pass for the present What shall we do to pass the
evening You play picquet and hazard of course

Do I not says Starlight his eyes lighting up in a way I didnt
remember Its many a day since Ive met with any one near my old
form

Then suppose we have a game or two says Mr Knightley after dinner
or supper whichever we choose to call it I have cards they luckily
came up the other day In the meantime you will find the claret very
fair and this cold wild turkeyI shot a brace last Thursdayis not to
be despised

We had a rattling good feed and no mistake whatever it was The turkey
was a grand bird and weighed 21 lb he told us The cook had sent in
some hot potatoes and chaps like us that had been riding walking and
fighting for twenty hours right on end had just the sort of appetite
that a bird of that kind deserved He was as fat as butter too They
feed on dandelion seeds at that time of the year It gives em a sort of
gamy flavour such as no other bird wild or tame has To my liking
the wild turkey beats the black duck even Hes the best game bird that
flies in the bush

Mr Knightley too now his wife was safe on her way to Bathurst and
things seemed going well was full of fun and kept us all going He
helped everybody twice over and wouldnt hear of any one keeping
the bottle standing The night was close rather and we were all that
thirsty it went down like mothers milk Wall and Hulbert got pleasant
enough and joined in now that Moran was out of the way He was snoring
in a back room and like a man in the deadhouse of a bush shanty not
likely to wake before sunrise Mr Knightley told us some outandout
good yarns and Hulbert and Wall swore that if theyd known he was such
a good sort theyd never have thought of sticking up the place He said
he had been quite mistaken about them and that another time he should
know better than to volunteer for work that was not part of his duty
By that time the claret had gone round pretty often and without being
screwed wed all had our tongues loosened a bit

After that we lit our pipes and we three began to play allfours and
euchre sometimes one pair sometimes another As for Mr Knightley and
Starlight they got out a curious filigree sort of a little cardtable
and began to play some outlandish game that I didnt know and to look
very serious over it

They had notes for counters and I could see as I looked over every
now and then that each man was doing all he knew to best the other
Sometimes one had the show sometimes the other We got tired and had
another smoke and turned in The beds were snug and comfortable Mr
Knightley showed us where to go and we wanted a good nights rest bad
enough

Just before I turned in I went up to the table They looked as keen
at it as if theyd just began and I heard Starlight say I owe you
a hundred now Ill play you double or quits So I left them to it I
could see they were not on for bed just then Both men were cool enough
but I could see that Starlight and Id never known him to touch a card
before was one of those men that would never rise from the table as
long as he had a shilling left and would stake everything he had in the
world upon the turn of a card

We all slept sound but most of us were up at sunrise It doesnt do for
chaps in our line to be caught napping and the police might have got
wind where we were at work We had our horses to look to and to give a
look round in a general way to see if things were right

Starlight and Mr Knightley didnt turn out they took it easy perhaps
theyd been up later than us anyhow they didnt show till breakfast
when they both made pretty fair time over the eatables

My word it was a breakfast though wed got a bit tired waiting for it
The old cook had hashed up the turkey it was stunning almost better
than the day before Then bacon and eggs grilled steak fresh bread and
butter coffee and tea watercresses Really I thought we never should
stop It was lucky the police didnt come or we shouldnt have done
much in the fighting line or the runaway either As it turned out Sir
Ferdinand wasnt so very far off the line but he took another road
He never had any luck somehow in following us up though he had some
firstrate chances Moran was off his feed and wouldnt come in He
took a nip and walked down to the creek We were all glad enough to get
shut of him

After breakfast and a turn round the stables blest if Starlight and Mr
Knightley didnt have out the cards again and at it they went as fresh
and keen as ever We didnt know what in the world to do with ourselves
till it was time to start to ride out to the Black Stump where we were
to meet the doctor and collar the 500 Pounds They didnt waste a minute
of their time till about halfpast twelve Starlight puts down his cards
very gently and says he

Im afraid we have no more time to spare Ive enjoyed the play more
than I have done anything for years I leave you 100 Pounds now in
notes and you must take my I O U for the balance What bank shall I pay
it into

The Australian says Mr Knightley At your convenience of course

Within a month says Starlight bowing And now a glass of wine and a
biscuit its time to be off

We had something as good nearer the mark than that and Moran sat down
too and played a good knife and fork Hed come to after his booze
and was ready for any fresh villainy as usual He didnt let on to
be nasty but he looked sulky enough and I saw his eye fixed on Mr
Knightley and Starlight now and then as if hed have given a good deal
to have had them where they hadnt so many at their backs




Chapter 46



We ate well and drank better still at the lunch although we had such a
regular tuckout at breakfast time Mr Knightley wouldnt hear of any
of us shirking our liquor and by the time wed done all hands were
pretty well on Moran himself began to look pleasant or as good a
sample of it as Id ever seen in him Mr Knightley could get round the
devil himself I believe I never saw his equals at that business and
this particular time he was in great feather seeing that he was likely
to get out of an ugly business all right He was as sure of the 500
Pounds in notes being there at the appointed hour as he was of the sun
setting that particular evening

I think its a fair thing says Starlight at last looking at his
watch Mr Knightley wasnt the first to speak no fear Take us all
our time to get to the Black Stump We shall have to ride too Moran
and Wall got up and fetched their horses Mr Knightleys was led up by
one of his men He was a big handsome roan in top condition and the
man was riding a black horse with a tan muzzle that looked a trifle
better if anything Mr Knightley turned out in boots and breeches
with a gold foxs head on his scarf swell hunting fashion as they do
it at home Starlight said

When Starlights horse came up he was as lame as a tree couldnt put
his foot to the ground got a kick or a strain or trod on a glass
bottle or something Anyhow he had only three legs that he could rise a
move out of Starlight looked rather glum He wasnt his second best or
his third best either All the same a horse is a horse and I never saw
the man yet that a lame horse didnt put out a bit

Confound it says he what a nuisance Its just the way with these
infernal halfbred brutes they always let me down at the wrong time

Look here old fellow says Mr Knightley leave him behind and take
this black horse the boys on hes one of the finest hacks you ever
crossed I refused sixty guineas for him the other day from Morringer

Thanks very much says Starlight brightening up a bit but I hardly
like to deprive you of him Wont you want him yourself

Oh I can manage without him says Mr Knightley Ill let you have
him for fifty and allow you ten pounds for your screw You can add it on
to your I O U and pay it in with the other

We all laughed at this and Moran said if he was dealing with Mr
Knightley hed get him a pound or two cheaper But Starlight said very
seriouslike that the arrangement would suit him very well So he had
his saddle shifted and the groom led back the bay and turned him loose
in the paddock

We mounted then and it looked as if we were all matched for a race to
the Black Stump Moran had a good horse and when he set him going in
the first bit of thick timber we came to it took a man I tell you to
keep him in sight Starlight made the black horse hit out in a way that
must have been a trifle strange to him unless hed been in training
lately As for Mr Knightley he took it easy and sailed away on one
side with Joe Wall and me He played it out cool to the last and wasnt
going to hurry himself for anybody

Halfanhour before sundown we rode up to the Black Stump It was a
rumlooking spot but everybody knew it for miles round There was
nothing like it anywhere handy It was within a reasonable distance of
Bathurst and not so far from a place we could make to where there was
good shelter and hiding too if we were pushed

There were two or three roads led up to it and crossed thereone from
Bathurst one to Turon and another straight into the forest country
which led range by range to Nulla Mountain We could see on a good way
ahead and though there was no one at the tree when we came a single
horseman was riding along the road for Bathurst We all drew rein round
the stump It had been a tremendous big old ironbark treenobody knew
how old but it had had its top blown off in a thunderstorm and the
carriers had lighted so many fires against the roots of it that it had
been killed at last and the sides were as black as a steamers funnel
After a bit we could make out the doctors shorttailed mousy mare and
him powdering along at a sort of hand gallop

When he came up close he took off his hat and made a bow Chentlemen
of the roat I salude you he says You haf kebt your bromise to
the letter and you will fint that Albert von Schiller has kept his
Hauptman says he to Starlight I delifer to you the ransom of dies
wothy chentleman and his most excellend and hochbesahltes laty who has
much recovered from her fadigues and I demant his freetom

Well done most trustrepaying and notevertobeentirelyforgotten
herald says Starlight I hand over to these worthy free companions
the frankgeld isnt that the termand when they have counted it for
they wont take your word or mine the Graf heremost highborn
and highbeseeming but uncommonlynearending his glorious career
magnatewill be restored to you Very pleasant company weve found him
I should like to have my revenge at picquet thats all

While this was going on Starlight had collared the bundle of notes from
the doctor and chucked it over quite carelesslike to Moran There it
is for you says he You can divide it between you Dick and I stand
out this time and you cant say youve done badly

Moran didnt say anything but he and Wall got off their horses and sat
down on their heelsnative fashion Then they turned to counting out
the notes one by one They were all fiversso it took some timeas
they neither of em werent very smart at figures and after theyd got
out twenty or thirty theyd get boxed like a new hand counting sheep
and have to begin all over again It must have been aggravating to Mr
Knightley and he was waiting to be let go in a manner of speaking He
never showed it but kept smoking and yarning with Starlight pointing
out how grand the sun was just asetting on the Bulga Mountainsjust
for all the world as if hed given a picnic and was making himself
pleasant to the people that stayed longest

At long last theyd got to the end of the conning and divided the
notes Moran tied his up in a bunch and rolled em in his poncho but
Wall crammed his into his pocket and made em all stick out like a
boy thats been stealing apples When they mounted their horses Mr
Knightley shook hands with me and Starlight Then he turns round to
Moran and WallWere parting good friends after alls said and done
he says Just as well matters have been settled this way Come now in
cool blood aint you rather glad Moran

Dashed if I know growls he All I know is youre deuced well out of
it your luck maynt be so good another time

Nor yours either my friend says Mr Knightley drawing up his
bridlerein I had only a snapshot at you when that bullet went
through your poncho or youd be lying alongside of Daly However I
neednt waste my breath talking to that brute he says to Starlight I
know well all I owe to you and Dick Marston here Some day I may repay
it

You mean what I owe you says Starlight turning it off with a laugh
Never fear youll find that paid to your credit in the bank We
have agents in all sorts of places Goodbye and a safe ride home My
respectful compliments to Mrs Knightley Perhaps youd better follow
the doctor now The old gentleman had got tired waiting and ridden on
slow and easy

Two or three weeks after Starlight and I were taking a ride towards the
Bogan Road not that we was on for anything particular but just having
a turn round for want of something else to do when we saw a big mob of
cattle coming along with three or four stockriders behind em Then
we met a loaded dray and team in front that had rations and swags and
a tent The driver asked us if we knew a good place to camp He was a
talking sort of chap and we yarned away with him for a bit He told
us how the boss was behind in a dogcart and tandem with two led horses
besides The cattle were going to take up a new run hed bought on the
Lower Bogan an outandout wild place but hed got the country cheap
and thought it would pay in the end He was going ahead after a stage or
two but just now he was camping with them

My word hes well in is the cove says the horsedriver hes got
halfadozen stations besides this one Hell be one of the richest men
in Australia yet

After we saw the cattle about a thousand head we thought it would be a
middling days work to stick up the cove and put him through Going to
form a new station hed very like have cash about as hed have to pay
for a lot of things on the nail just at first If he was such a swell
too hed have a gold watch and perhaps a few more trifles Anyhow he
was good for the days expenses and we thought wed try it on

So we passed the cattle and rode quietly along the road till we saw his
dogcart coming then we stopped inside a yarran scrub just as he came
bya squarebuilt man he seemed to be muffled up in a big rough coat
It was a cool morning We rode up sharpish and showed our revolvers
singing out to him to bail up He pulled up quick and stared at us So
we did at him Then the three of us burst out laughingregular roared
again

Who should it be but old George Storefield

Well this is a prime joke says he I knew you were out somewhere on
this road but I never thought I should live to be stuck up by you Dick
Marston

I looked foolish It was rather a stunner when you come to think of it

I beg a thousand pardons says Starlight Ridiculous mistake Want
of something to occupy our time For Satan finds some mischief still
etc Isnt that the way the hymn runs Wonderfully true isnt it
Youll accept our apologies Mr Storefield I trust Poor Dick here
will never get over it

How was I to know Why George old man we thought it was the Governor
turned squatter or old Billy Wentworth himself Your trade pays better
than ours let alone being on the square Well shake hands well be
off You wont tell the girls theres a good fellow will you

I cant promise says old George its too good a joke Here he
laughed a good one It isnt often a man gets stuck up by his friends
like this Tell you what come and have some lunch and well talk it
over

His man rode up then with the spare horse Luckily he was a good way
behind as fellows will keep when theyre following a trap so that they
cant be any good when theyre wanted In this case it was just as well
He hadnt seen anything

Hobble the horses out and put on their nosebags Williams says he
and then get out the lunch Put the things under that tree

They took out the horses and the chap got out a basket with cold beef
and bread and half a tongue and a bottle of good whisky and waterbag

We sat down on the grass and as wed been riding since sunrise we did
pretty well in the feed line and had a regular good bit of fun I never
thought old George had so much go in him but good times had made him
twice the man he used to be

After a bit he sends the groom down to the Cowall to water the horses
and says he

Captain youd better come and manage Willaroon down there with Dick
for stockman Theres a fortune in it and its a good way off yet
Nobody would think of looking for you there Youre a new chum just out
from home you know Plenty of spare country Ill send you some cattle
to start you on a new run after a bit

If we could throw our past behind us Id do it and thank God on my
knees said Starlight It would make me almost a happy man again But
why think of that or any other honest life in this colony now Weve
debarred ourselves from it now and for ever Our only hope is in another
landAmericaif we can get away We shant be long here now were
both sick of this accursed work

The sooner the better says George taking his hand and giving it
a hearty grip And look here you work your way quietly down to
Willaroon Thats my place and Ill give you a line across to the
Queensland border From there you can get over to Townsville and its
easy to sail from there to the islands or any port out of reach of harm
from here

Well tackle it next month if were alive says I So we parted

Not long after this we got a letter from Jim Hed heard all about the
way to do it from a man hed met in Melbourne that had worked his way
down overland from the North He said once you were there or near
there there was little or no chance of being interfered with Jeanie
was always in a fright every day Jim went away lest he might be taken
and not let come back So she was always keeping him up to the mark
making him inquire here and look out there until he got a bit of
information which told him what he wanted

This man that worked in the store with him was a fast sort of card
who had been mate of a brig cruising all about and back to Sydney with
sandalwood bechedemer and what they call island trade

Well the captain of the craft who was part owner had settled in
his mind that hed trade regular with San Francisco now and touch at
Honolulu going and coming He was to be back at Gladstone in about three
months and then start for California straight away

This was the very thing just made to suit us all to pieces If we could
make out to one of the Queensland northern ports it would be easy enough
to ship under different names Once in America wed be in a new world
and thered be nothing to stop us from leading a new life




Chapter 47



When we got the notion into our heads we set to work to carry it out
We didnt want to leave Aileen and mother behind So it was settled that
I was to go over and see them and try and persuade them to go down to
Melbourne and stop with Jeanie after Jim had started

Then if we all got safe over to San Francisco Jeanie and they could
come over by the first ship that sailed There was no down upon them
so they could do anything they liked The main thing was to get Jim off
safe and me and Starlight After that the rest might come along when
they pleased As for dad he was to take his own road to go and stay as
he chose It wasnt much use trying to make him do anything else But he
was more like to stop at the old Hollow than anywhere else It wouldnt
have seemed home to him anywhere else even where he was born I
believe

The first thing of all was to go to the old place and see mother and
Aileen They were both back at the old cottage and were a bit more
comfortable now George Storefield had married a ladya real lady as
Aileen saidand though she was a nice goodtempered young woman as
ever was Aileen of course wouldnt stay there any longer She thought
home was the best place after all

We took a couple of days figuring it out at the Hollow Starlight had
a map and we plotted it out and marked all the stages which could be
safely madewent over all the back tracks and crosscountry lines some
we had travelled before and others of which we knew pretty well from
hearsay

After wed got all this cut and dry I started away one beautiful
sunshiny morning to ride over to Rocky Flat I remember the day as well
as yesterday because I took notice of it at the time and had better
cause to remember it before all was over Everything looked so lovely as
I began to clear the foot hills of Nulla Mountain The birds seemed to
chirp and whistle gayer than they ever did before The dewdrops on the
grass and all the twigs and shoots of the trees looked as if it was
covered with diamonds and rubies as the sun began to shine and melt some
of them My horse stepped along limber and free O Lord I says
to myself out aloud what a happy cove I might be if I could start
freshknowing what I knowand not having all these things against me

When I got on to the tableland above Rocky Flat I took a good look at
the whole place Everything was as quiet and peaceful as if nothing had
ever happened within miles of itas if I hadnt had Gorings handcuffs
on meas if Jim hadnt had the bullets whistling round him and risked
his life on an unbridled horseas if the four dead men had not lain
staring up to the sky in the gully up yonder for days before they were
found and buried

But now it looked as if only two or three people had ever been there
from the beginning of the world The wild ducks swam and splashed in the
little waterhole above the house Two or three of the cows were walking
down to the creek as quiet and peaceable as you please There was some
poultry at the back and the little garden was done up that nicely as it
hadnt been for many a day

After Id pretty well settled in my own mind that there was no one anext
or anigh the old place I drew up by degrees bit by bit and sneaked
across the creek I was just making for the barn when I saw two horsemen
pop up sudden round the back of the house and ride towards the front
gate I saw with half an eye they were Sir Ferdinand Morringer and a
trooper

Lucky for me they were looking up the gully instead of my way and
though my heart nearly stood still I rode as hard as I could lick for
the gate of the barn which was betwixt me and them They never looked
round They were too much taken up with watching the spot where Hagan
and his lot were found I had just time to chevy straight into the
barn and pull off my saddle and bridle and hide under the hay when they
shifted full towards where Id been and then hung up their horses The
trooper tied his to a dead branch of a tree and then went moving about
I was mortally afraid of his stumbling against something and spoiling
the whole affair

It seems Sir Ferdinand had never given up the notion of our turning up
at Rocky Flat some day or other so he used to take a turn himself that
way every now and again on the chance and a very good chance it nearly
turned out to be Besides this it seems since hed heard of her being
at the ball at Turon hed taken a great fancy to Aileen and used
to talk to her as much as shed let him when she was at George
Storefields and any other place where he met her He wouldnt have
had much chance of saying the second word only he was a goodnatured
amusing sort and always as respectful to her as if shed been a lady
Besides Aileen had a kind of fancy that it might make things no worse
for us if she was civil to him Any way she thought as women will do
that she might get something out of him perhaps once in a way that would
be of use to us I dont believe as it would make a scrap of difference
one way or the other And like people who try to be too clever she was
pretty near being caught in her own trap this time Not that I blame the
poor thing she did all for the best and would have given the eyes out
of her head I believe to have done us real good and seen us clear of
all our troubles

Well she brings a chair out on the verandah and Sir Ferdinand he sat
down on a bench there for halfanhour talking away and laughing just
as gentlemen will to pretty girls no matter who they are And I could
see Aileen look up and laugh now and then pleased like She couldnt
help it And there was I stuck in the confounded barn among the straw
all the time looking out through one of the cracks and wondering if he
was ever going to clear out Sometimes I thought the trooper who was
getting tired of dodging about doing nothing couldnt be off seeing my
horses tracks leading slap into the barn door But he was thinking of
something else or else wasnt much in the tracking line Some men would
see a whole army of fresh tracks as plain as print right under their
noses and wouldnt drop down to anything

However last of all I saw him unhitch his horse and take the bridle on
his arm and then Aileen put on her hat and walked up to the top of the
ridge along the stony track with him Then I saw him mount and start
off at a rattling good bat along the road to Turon and the trooper after
him I felt all right again then and watched Aileen come slowly down
the road again with her head down quite thoughtful like very different
from the way she went up She didnt stop at the house but walked
straight down to the barn and came in at the door I wondered what she
would do when she saw my horse But she didnt start only said

You may come out now Dick I knew you were here I saw you ride in
just as Sir Ferdinand and the trooper came up

So thats why you were making yourself so pleasant says I laughingly
I mustnt tell Starlight I suppose or we shall be having a new yarn
in the newspapersDuel between Sir Ferdinand Morringer and Captain
Starlight

She laughed too and then looked sad and serious like again

I wonder if we shall ever have an end to this wretched hideandseek
work God knows I would do anything that an honest girl could do for you
boys and him but it sometimes looks dark enough and I have dreadful
fears that all will be in vain and that we are fated to death and ruin
at the end

Come come dont break down before the time I said Its been a
close shave though but Sir Ferdinand wont be back for a bit so we
may as well take it easy Ive got a lot to say to you

He said he wouldnt be back this way till Friday week says she He
has an escort to see to then and he expected to be at Stony Creek in a
couple of hours from this Hell have to ride for it

We walked over to the house Neither of us said anything for a bit
Mother was sitting in her old chair by the fire knitting Many a good
pair of woollen socks shed sent us and manys the time wed had call
to bless her and her knittingas we sat our horses night after night
in a perishing frost or when the rain set in that run of wet winters we
had when wed hardly a dry stitch on us by the week together when
we had enough of them and the neck wrappers I expect plenty of others
round about were glad to get em It was partly for good nature for
mother was always a kindhearted poor soul as ever was and would give
away the shoes off her feetlike most Irish people Ive metto any one
that wanted them worse than herself and partly for the ease it gave
her mind to be always doing something steady like Mother hadnt
booklearning and didnt always understand the things Aileen read to
her She was getting too old to do much in the house now But her eyes
were wonderful good still and this knitting was about the greatest
pleasure she had left in the world If anything had happened to stop her
from going on with that I dont believe she would have lived a month

Her poor old face brightened up when she seen me and for a few minutes
youd have said no thought of trouble could come anigh her Then the
tears rolled down her cheeks and I could see her lips moving though
she did not speak the words I knew what she was doing and if that
could have kept us right wed never have gone wrong in the world But it
was to be I suppose

Mother was a deal olderlooking and couldnt move about as well as she
did Aileen said shed often sit out in the sun for an hour together and
watch her walking up the garden or putting up the calves and carrying
in the water from the creek and say nothing Sometimes she thought her
mind was going a bit and then again shed seem as sensible as ever she
was Today after a bit she came round and talked more and asked about
the neighbours seemed more curious like than shed done Aileen said
for many a long day

You must have something to eat Dick says Aileen its a long ride
fromfrom where we knowand what with one thing and another I daresay
youve an appetite Let me see what there is Mrs Storefield sent us
over a quarter of veal from the farm yesterday and weve plenty of
bacon of our own Mother and I live half our time on it and the eggs
Im making quite a fortune by the butter lately These diggings are
wonderful places to send up the price of everything we can grow

So she got out the fryingpan and she and I and mother had some veal
chops with a slice or two of bacon to give it a flavour My word they
were good after a fortymile ride and wed had nothing but corned beef
in the Hollow lately Fresh butter and milk too it was a treat We had
cows enough at the Hollow but we didnt bother ourselves milking bread
and beef and tea with a glass of grog now and then was the general run
of our grub

We had a talk about the merry time at the Turon races and Aileen
laughed in spite of herself at the thought of Starlight walking down the
ballroom to be introduced to her and being taken up to all the swell
people of the place He looked grander than any of them to my fancy
said she and oh what a cruel shame it seems that he should ever have
done what keeps him from going among his equals as he was born to do
Then I should never have seen him I suppose and a thousand times
better too Id give up every hope of seeing him again in this world
God knows how cheerfully if it would serve him or help his escape

Im down here now to see you about the same escape I said and then
I told her about Jims letter and what he said about the mate of the
ship She listened for a good while patiently with her hand in mine
like we used to sit in old days when we were young and happy and
alivealive not dead men and women walking about and making believe
to live So I told her how we made it up to meet somewhere near the
Queensland border Jim to come up the Murray from Melbourne and so on
to the Darling and we to make across for the Lower Bogan If we could
carry this out all rightand it looked pretty likelythe rest of the
game would be easy and once on blue waterO my God what new creatures
we should all be

Aileen threw her arms round my neck and sobbed and cried like a child
she couldnt speak for a bit and when she looked up her eyes seemed to
have a different kind of look in thema faraway dreamy sort of light
from what Id ever noticed in them

It may come about she said Dick Ive prayed whole nights through
and vowed my life to the Blessed Virgin She may accept the service of
my years that are to come It may be permitted after all the sins of our
people

After this she dried her eyes and went to her room for a bit while I
had a quiet easy sort of talk with mother she saying a word or two
now and then and looking at me most of the time as if that was enough
without talking

Then Aileen came out of her room with her habit and hat on Run up
my horse Dick she says and Ill take you over to see George
Storefields new place A ride will do me good and I daresay youre not
tired

I caught her horse and saddled him for her and off we went down the old
track we knew so well all our lives

I told her all about our lark with old George and how good hed been
through it all besides promising to give us a lift through his country
when we made the grand start She said it was just like himthat he
was the kindest soul in the world and the most thoughtful The new Mrs
Storefield had been very civil and friendly to her and told her she
knew Georges feeling towards her and respected it But Aileen never
could feel at home in the grand new house now and only would go to see
old Mrs Storefield who still lived in the family cottage and found
it the best suited to her So we yarned away till we got in sight of the
place When I saw the new twostory stone house I was regular struck all
of a heap

Old George had got on in the world and no mistake Hed worked early and
late always been as steady as a rock and had looked ahead instead
of taking his pleasure straight off when he got the first few hundred
pounds together Hed seen fat cattle must be dear and scarce for years
to come Noticed too that however cheap a faraway bit of country was
held sometimes bought for 200 or 300 Pounds it always rose in value
year by year So with store cattle Now and again theyd fall to
nothing Then hed buy a whole lot of poor milkers calves about
Burrangong or some of those thick places where they never fattened for
1 Pound a head or less and send them away to his runs in the Lachlan
In six months you wouldnt know em Theyd come down wellgrown fat
cattle in a year or two and be worth their 6 or 8 Pounds a head

The same way with land he bought up all the little bits of
allotments with cottages on them round Paramatta and Windsor way and
Campbelltownall them oldfashioned sleepy old places near Sydney for
cash and cheap enough The people that had them and had lived a pokey
life in them for many a year wanted the money to go to the diggings
with and quite right too Still and all this land was rising in value
and Georges children if he had any would be among the richest people
in the colony

After hed married Miss Oldhamthey were Hawkesbury people her
grandfather old Captain Oldham was one of the officers in the first
regiment that came outhe didnt see why he shouldnt have as good a
house as any one else So he had a gentleman up from Sydney that drew
plans and he had a real stone house built with rooms upstairs and
furniture to match a new garden and a glass house at the side for all
the world like some of them grand places in Darling Point near Sydney

Aileen wouldnt go in and you may be sure I didnt want to but we
rode all round the place a little way off and had a real good look
at everything There wasnt a gentleman in the country had better
outbuildings of all sorts It was a real tiptop place good enough
for the Governor himself if he came to live up the country All the old
fencing had been knocked down and new railings and everything put up
Some of the scraggy trees had been cleared away and all the dead wood
burned I never thought the old place could have showed out the way
it did But money can do a lot It aint everything in this world But
theres precious little it wont get you and things must be very bad it
wont mend A man must have very little sense if he dont see as he
gets older that character and money are the two things hes got to be
carefullest of in this world If hes not particular to a shade about
either or both of em hell find his mistake

After wed had a good look round and seen the good wellbred stock in
the paddocks the growing crops all looking firstrate everything well
fed and hearty showing there was no stint of grub for anything man or
beast we rode away from the big house entrance and came opposite the
sliprails on the flat that led to the old cottage

Wouldnt you like to go in just for a minute Dick says Aileen

I knew what she was thinking of

I was half a mind not but then something seemed to draw me and I was
off my horse and had the sliprail down before I knew where I was

We rode up to the porch just outside the verandah where Georges father
had planted the creeping roses big clusters of bloom they used to have
on em when I was a boy He showed em to me I remember and said
what fine climbers they were Now they were all over the porch and the
verandah and the roof of the cottage all among the shingles But Mrs
Storefield wouldnt have em cut because her old man had planted em
She came out to see us

Well Ailie child says she come along in dont sit there on your
horse Whos this youve got with you Oh its you Dick is it My
eyes aint as good as they were Well come along in too Youre on the
wrong road and worse ll come of it But come along in Im not going
to be the one to hunt you I remember old times when you were a little
toddling chap as bold as a lion and no one dreamt youd grow up to
be the wild chap you are Graceys inside I think Shes as big a fool
about ye as ever

I very near broke down at this I could stand hard usage and send back
as good as I got but this good old woman that had no call to think
anything of me but that Id spoiled her daughters chance of marrying
well and respectablywhen she talked to me this way I came close up to
making a fool of myself

We walked in Gracey was sewing away in the little parlour where there
always used to be a nosegay when I was a boy and it was that clean and
neat I was afraid to go into it and never easy till I got out again
There she sat as soberlooking and steady as if shed been there for
five years and meant to be for five years more She wasnt thinking of
anybody coming but when she looked up and saw me her face changed all
of a sudden and she jumped up and dropped her work on the floor

Why whatever brings you here Dick she said Dont you know its
terribly dangerous Sir Ferdinand is always about here now He stayed at
Georges new house last night Wasnt he at Rocky Flat today

Yes but he wont be back for a week He told Aileen here he wouldnt
Here I looked at them both

Aileens carrying on quite a flirtation with Sir Ferdinand
says Gracey I dont know what some one else would say if he saw
everything

Doesnt he talk to any one when he comes here or make himself
pleasant I said Perhaps theres more than one in the game

Perhaps there is says Gracey but he thinks I believe that he can
get something out of us girls about you and your goings on and where
you plant and we think were quite as clever as he is and might learn
something useful too So thats how the matter lies at present Are you
going to be jealous

Not a bit in the world I said even if I had the right Ill back
you two as simple as you look against any inspector of police from
here to South Australia

After this we began to talk about other things and I told Gracey all
about our plans and intentions She listened very quiet and steady to it
all and then she said she thought something might come of it Anyhow
she would go whenever I sent for her to come no matter where

What Ive said to you Dick Ive said for good and all It may be in a
month or two or it may be years and years But whenever the time comes
and we have a chance a reasonable chance of living peaceably and
happily you may depend upon my keeping my word if Im alive

We three had a little more talk together and Aileen and I mounted and
rode home

It was getting on dusk when we started They wanted us to stop but I
darent do it It was none too safe as it was and it didnt do to throw
a chance away Besides I didnt want to be seen hanging about Georges
place There was nobody likely to know about Aileen and me riding up
together and stopping halfanhour but if it came to spending the
evening there was no saying who might have ears and eyes open At home
I could have my horse ready at a minutes warning and be off like a
shot at the first whisper of danger

So off we went We didnt ride very fast back It was many a day since
we had ridden over that ground together side by side It might be many
a day years perhaps before we did the same thing again Perhaps never
Who was to know In the risks of a life like mine I might never come
backnever set eyes again upon the sister that would have given her
life for mine Never watch the stars glitter through the forestoak
branches or hear the little creek ripple over the slate bar as it did
tonight




Chapter 48



We rode along the old track very quiet talking about old timesor
mostly saying nothing thinking our own thoughts Something seemed to
put it into my head to watch every turn in the trackevery tree and
bush by the roadsideevery sound in the airevery star in the sky
Aileen rode along at last with her head drooped down as if she hadnt
the heart to hold it up How hard it must have seemed to her to think
she didnt dare even to ride with her own brother in the light of day
without starting at every bush that stirredat every footstep horse or
man that fell on her ear

There wasnt a breath of air that night Not a leaf stirrednot a bough
moved of all the trees in the forest that we rode through A possum
might chatter or a nightowl cry out but there wasnt any other sound
except the ripple of the creek over the stones that got louder and
clearer as we got nearer Rocky Flat There was nothing like a cloud in
the sky even It wasnt an over light night but the stars shone out
like so many fireballs and it was that silent any one could almost have
fancied they heard the people talking in the house we left though it
was miles away

I sometimes wonder Aileen says at last raising up her head if I
had been a man whether I should have done the same things you and Jim
have or whether I should have lived honestly and worked steadily like
George over there I think I should have done so I really do that
nothing would have tempted me to take what was not my ownor totodo
other things I dont think it is in my nature somehow

I dont say as you would Ailie I put in but theres many things
to be thought of when you come to reckon what a boy sees and how hes
brought up in the bush Its different with girlsthough Ive known
some of them that were no great shakes either and middling handy among
the clearskins too

Its hard to say she went on more as if she was talking to herself
than to me I feel that Bad examplelove of pleasurestrong
temptationevil companyall these are heavy weights to drag down mens
souls to hell Who knows whether I should have been better than the
thousands the millions that have fallen that have taken the broad
road that leads to destruction Oh how dreadful it seems to think that
when once a man has sinned in some ways in this world theres no turning
backno hopeno mercyonly long bitter years of prison lifeworse
than death or if anything can be worse a felons death a doom dark
and terrible dishonouring to those that die and to those that live
Oh that my prayers may availnot my prayers only but my lifes
servicemy lifes service

Next morning I was about at daybreak and had my horse fed and saddled
up with the bridle on his neck ready all but slipping the bit into his
mouth in case of a quick start I went and helped Aileen to milk her
cows nine or ten of them there were a fairish mornings work for one
girl mothering the calves bailing up legroping and all the rest of
it We could milk well all three of us and mother too when she was
younger Women are used to cattle in Ireland and England too The men
dont milk there I hear tell That wouldnt work here Women are scarce
in the regular bush and though theyll milk for their own good and on
their own farms youll not get a girl to milk when shes at service
for anybody else

One of the young cows was a bit strange with me so I had to shake a
stick at her and sing out Bail up pretty rough before shed put her
head in Aileen smiled something like her old self for a minute and
said

That comes natural to you now Dick doesnt it

I stared for a bit and then burst out laughing It was a rum go wasnt
it The same talk for cows and Christians Thats how things get stuck
into the talk in a new country Some old hand like father as had been
assigned to a dairy settler and spent all his mornings in the cowyard
had taken to the bush and tried his hand at sticking up people When
they came near enough of course hed pop out from behind a tree in a
rock with his old musket or a pair of pistols and when he wanted
em to stop Bail up dyer would come a deal quicker and more
naturallike to his tongue than Stand So bail up it was from that
day to this and therell have to be a deal of change in the ways of the
colonies and them as come from em before anything else takes its place
between the man thats got the arms and the man thats got the money

After wed turned out the cows we put the milk into the little dairy
How proud Jim and I used to be because we dug out the cellar part and
built the sod wall round the slabs Father put on the thatch then it
was as cool and clean as ever Many a good drink of cold milk we had
there in the summers that had passed away Well well its no use
thinking of those sort of things Theyre dead and gone like a lot of
other things and peoplelike I shall be before long if it comes to
that

We had breakfast pretty comfortable and cheerful Mother looked pleased
and glad to see me once more and Aileen had got on her old face again
and was partly come round to her old ways

After breakfast Aileen and I went into the garden and had a long talk
over the plan we had chalked out for getting away to Queensland I got
out a map Starlight had made and showed her the way we were going to
head and why he thought it more likely to work than he had done before
I was to make my way down the Macquarie and across by Duck Creek
Georges station Willaroon start from there with a mob of cattle to
Queensland as drover or anything that would suit my book

Jim was to get on to one of the Murray River boats at Swan Hill and
stick to her till he got a chance to go up the Darling with an Adelaide
boat to Bourke He could get across from there by Cunnamulla towards
Rockhampton and from there we were safe to find plenty of vessels bound
for the islands or San Francisco We had hardly cared where as far as
that goes as long as we got clear away from our own country

As soon as Jeanie got a word from Jim that hed sailed and was clear of
Australia shed write up to Aileen who was to go down to Melbourne
and take mother with her They could stop with Jeanie until they got a
message from San Francisco to say hed safely arrived there After that
they could start by the first steamer Theyd have money enough to take
their passages and something handsome in cash when they got to land

Aileen agreed to it all but in a curious sort of way It looked well
she said and might be carried out particularly as we were all going
to work cautiously and with such a lot of preparation Everything that
she could do would be done we might be sure but though she had prayed
and sought aid from the Blessed Virgin and the saintsfasting and on
her bare knees night after nightshe had not been able to get one
gleam of consolation Everything looked very dark and she had a
terrible feeling of anxiety and dread about the carrying it out But she
didnt want to shake my courage I could see so she listened and smiled
and cheered me up a bit at the end and I rode away thinking there was
a good show for us after all

I got back to the Hollow right enough and for once in a way it seemed
as if the luck was on our side Maybe it was going to turnwho was to
know There had been men who had been as deep in it as any of us that
had got clean away to other countries and lived safe and comfortable to
the day of their deathdidnt die so soon eitherlived to a good round
age and had wives and children round them that never knew but what
theyd been as good as the best That wouldnt be our case but still
if we once were able to put the sea between us and our old life the odds
would be all in our favour instead of being a hundred to one that we
werent placed and no takers

Starlight was glad enough to see me back and like everything he
tackled had been squaring it all for our getting away with head and
hand We wanted to take everything with us that could do us any good
naturally Father and he had made it right with some one they knew at
Turon to take the gold and give them a price for itnot all it was
worth but something over threefourths value The rest he was to keep
for his share for trouble and risk There was some risk no doubt in
dealing with us but all the gold that was bought in them days wasnt
square not by a lot But there was no way of swearing to it Gold was
gold and once it was in the banks it was lumped up with the rest There
was a lot of things to be thought of before we regularly made a move for
good and all but when you make up your mind for a dart its wonderful
how things shape We hadnt much trouble dividing the gold and what
cash there was we could whack easy enough There was the live stock that
was running in the Hollow of course We couldnt well take them with
us except a few of the horses We made a deal at last with father for
them He took my share and Starlights and paid us in cash out of his
share of the notes All we wanted was a couple of horses each one to
carry a pack one to ride

As for dad he told us out plump and plain that he wasnt going to
shift The Hollow was good enough for him and there he was going to
stop If Jim and I and Starlight chose to try and make blank emigrants
of ourselves well and good He didnt see as theyd have such a rosy
time getting over to these new townships on the other side We might get
took in and wish we was back again before all was said and done But
some people could never let well alone Here we had everything that any
man in his senses could wish for and we wasnt contented Every one was
going to cut away and leave him hed be all by himself with no one
but the dog for company and be as miserable as a bandicoot but no one
cared a blank brass farden about that

Come with us governor says Starlight have a cruise round the
world and smell salt water again Youve not been boxed up in the bush
all your life though youve been a goodish while there Make a start
and bring old Crib too

Im too old and getting stiff in the jints says dad brightening up
a bit or I dont say as I wouldnt Dont mind my growling But Im
bound to be a bit lonely like when you are all drawed off the camp No
take your own way and Ill take mine

Next Monday ought to see us off says Starlight We have got the gold
and cash part all right Ive had that money paid to Knightleys credit
in the Australian Bank I promised him and got a receipt for it

Thats just like yer says father and a rank soft thing for a man
as has seen the world to drop into Losin yer share of the five hundred
quid and then dropping a couple of hundred notes at one gamble besides
buying a horse yer could have took for nothing Hell never bring twenty
pound again neither

Always pay my play debts says Starlight Always did and always
will As for the horsea bargain a bargain

And a dashed bad bargain too Why didnt ye turn parson instead of
taking to the bush says father with a grin Dashed if I aint
seen some parsons that could give you odds and walk round ye at
horsedealin

You take your own way Ben and Ill take mine says Starlight rather
fierce and then father left off and went to do something or other
while us two took our horses and rode out We hadnt a long time to be
in the old Hollow now It had been a good friend to us in time of need
and we was sorry in a kind of way to leave it We were going to play for
a big stake and if we lost we shouldnt have another throw in

Our horses were in great buckle now they hadnt been doing much lately
I had the one Id brought with me and a thoroughbred brown horse that
had been broken in the first season we came there

Starlight was to ride Rainbow of course and he had great picking
before he made up his mind what to choose for second horse At last he
pitched upon a thoroughbred bay mare named Locket that had been stolen
from a mining township the other side of the country She was the
fastest mare theyd ever bredsound and a weightcarrier too

I think Ill take Locket after all says he after thinking about it
best part of an hour Shes very fast and a stayer Goodtempered too
and the old horse has taken up with her It will be company for him

Take your own way I said but I wouldnt chance her Shes known
to a lot of jockeyboys and hangerson They could swear to that white
patch on her neck among a thousand

If you come to that Rainbow is not an everyday horse and I cant
leave him behind can I Ill ship him if I can thats more But it
wont matter much for well have to take back tracks all the way You
didnt suppose we were to ride along the mail road did you

I didnt suppose anything says I but that we were going to clear
out the safest way we could If were to do the swell business wed
better do it apart or else put an advertisement into the Turon Star
that Starlight Marston and Co are giving up business and going to
leave the district all accounts owing to be sent in by a certain date

A firstrate idea says he Im dashed if I dont do it Theres
nothing like making ones exit in good form How savage Morringer will
be Thank you for the hint Dick

There was no use talking to him when he got into this sort of humour He
was the most mad reckless character I ever came across and any kind of
checking only seemed to make him worse So I left him alone for fear he
should want to do something more venturesome still and went on with my
packing and getting ready for the road

We fixed up to start on the Monday and get as far away the first couple
of days as we could manage We expected to get a good start by making a
great push the first day or two and as the police would be thrown off
the scent in a way we settledand a good dodge it waswe should have
all the more time to be clear of New South Wales before they regularly
dropped that we were giving them leg bail for it

The Sunday before Starlight started away by himself taking a couple
of good horses with himone he led and a spare saddle too He took
nothing but his revolver and didnt say where he was going but I
pretty well guessed to say goodbye to Aileen Just as he started he
looked back and says

Im going for a longish ride today Dick but I shall be here late if
Im back at all If anything happens to me my share of what there is I
give to her if she will take it If not do the best you can with it
for her benefit

He didnt take Warrigal with him which I was sorry for as the
halfcaste and I didnt hit it well together and when we were by
ourselves he generally managed to do or say something he knew I didnt
like I kept my hands off him on account of Starlight but there was
many a time my fingers itched to be at him and I could hardly keep from
knocking some of the sulkiness out of him This day somehow I was not
in the best of tempers myself I had a good lot on my mind Starting
away seems always a troublesome bothering sort of thing and if a mans
at all inclined to be cranky itll come out then

Next day we were going to start on a long voyage in a manner of
speaking and whether we should have a fair wind or the vessel of our
fortune would be wrecked and we go down with it no one could say This
is how it happened One of the horses was bad to catch and took a
little trouble in the yard Most times Warrigal was quiet enough with
em but when he got regular into a rage hed skin a horse alive I
really believe Anyhow he began to hammer the colt with a ropingpole
and as the yard was that high that no beast could jump it he had him at
his mercy I wouldnt have minded a lick or two but he went on and on
nearly knocking the poor brute down every time till I could stand it no
longer and told him to drop it

He gave me some saucy answer until at last I told him Id make him He
dared me and I rushed at him I believe hed have killed me that minute
if hed had the chance and he made a deuced good offer at it

He stuck to his ropingsticka good heavyended gum sapling six or
seven feet longand as I came at him he struck at my head with such
vengeance that if it had caught me fair I should never have kicked
I made a spring to one side and it hit me a crack on the shoulder that
wasnt a good thing in itself I was in at him before he could raise his
hands and let him have it right and left

Down he went and the stick atop of him He was up again like a wild
cat and at me hammer and tongsbut he hadnt the weight though he was
quick and smart with his hands I drew off and knocked him clean off his
pins Then he saw it wasnt good enough and gave it best

Never mind Dick Marston says he as he walked off and he fixed his
eyes on me that savage and deadlylooking with the blood running down
his face that I couldnt help shivering a bit youll pay for this I
owe it you and Jim one a piece

Confound you I said its all your own fault Why couldnt you stop
illusing the horse You dont like being hit yourself How do you think
he likes it

What business that of yours he said You mind your work and Ill
mind mine This is the worst days work youve done this year and so I
tell you

He went away to his gunyah then and except doing one or two things for
Starlight would not lift his hand for any one that day

I was sorry for it when I came to think I daresay I might have got him
round with a little patience and humbugging Its always a mistake to
lose your temper and make enemies theres no knowing what harm they may
do ye People like us oughtnt to throw away a chance even with a chap
like Warrigal Besides I knew it would vex Starlight and for his sake
I would have given a trifle it hadnt happened However I didnt see
how Warrigal could do me or Jim any harm without hurting him and I knew
hed have cut off his hand rather than any harm should come to Starlight
that he could help

So I got ready Dad and I had our tea together pretty comfortable and
had a longish talk The old man was rather down in the mouth for him
He said he somehow didnt expect the fakement to turn out well Youre
going away he said from where youre safe and theres a many things
goes against a man in our line once hes away from his own beat You
never know how you may be given away The Captains all right here when
hes me to look after him though he does swear at me sometimes but he
was took last time He was out on his own hook and its my belief hell
be took this time if he isnt very careful Hes a good man to fight
through things when once hes in the thick of em but he aint careful
enough to keep dark and close when the play isnt good You draw along
steady by yourself till you meet Jimthats my advice to ye

I mean to do that I shall work my way down to old Georges place and
get on with stock or something till we all meet at Cunnamulla After
that there aint much chance of these police here grabbing us

Unless youre followed up says the old man Ive known chaps to go
a deuce of a way once they got on the track and theres getting some
smart fellows among em nownativeborn chaps asll be as good at
picking up the tracks as you and Jim

Well we must take our chance Im sorry for one thing that I had
that barney with Warrigal It was all his fault But I had to give him
a hardish crack or two Hed turn dog on me and Jim and in a minute if
he saw his way without hurting Starlight

He cant do it says dad its sink or swim with the lot of you
And he dursnt either not he says father beginning to growl out his
words If I ever heard hed given away any one in the lot Id have his
life if I had to poleaxe him in George Street He knows me too

We sat yarning away pretty late The old man didnt say it but I made
out that he was sorry enough for that part of his life which had turned
out so bad for us boys and for mother and Aileen Bad enough he was in
a kind of way old dad but he wasnt all bad and I believe if he could
have begun again and thought of what misery he was going to bring on the
lot of us he would never have gone on the cross It was too late too
late now though to think of that

Towards morning I heard the old dog growl and then the tramp of a
horses feet Starlight rode up to the fire and let his horse go then
walked straight into his corner and threw himself down without speaking
He had had a precious long ride and a fast one by the look of his
horse The other one he had let go as soon as he came into the Hollow
but none of the three would be a bit the worse after a few hours rest
The horses of course were spare ones and not wanted again for a bit

Next morning it was sharps the word and no mistake I felt a deal
smarter on it than yesterday When youve fairly started for the road
half the journeys done Its the thinking of this and forgetting that
and wondering whether you havent left behind the tother thing thats
the miserablest part of going a journey when youre once away no
matter whats left behind you can get on some way or other

We didnt start so over and above early though Starlight was up as
fresh as paint at sunrise youd thought he hadnt ridden a yard the day
before Even at the very last theres a lot of things to do and to get
But we all looked slippy and didnt talk much so that we got through
what we had to do and had all the horses saddled and packed by about
eight oclock Even Warrigal had partly got over his temper Of course
I told Starlight about it He gave him a good rowing and told him he
deserved another hammering which he had a good mind to give him if we
hadnt been starting for a journey Warrigal didnt say a word to him
He never did Starlight told me on the quiet though he was sorry it
happened though its the rascals own fault and served him right
But hes a revengeful beggar he says and that he would play you some
dogs trick if he wasnt afraid of me you may depend your life on

Now says he we must make our little arrangements I shall be
somewhere about Cunnamulla by the end of this month it was only the
first week Jim knows that we are to meet there and if we manage that
all right I think the greatest part of the danger will be over I
shall get right across by Dandaloo to the back blocks of the West
Bogan country between it and the Lachlan There are tracks through the
endless mallee scrub only known to the tribes in the neighbourhood and
a few halfcastes like Warrigal that have been stockriding about them
Sir Ferdinand and his troopers might just as well hunt for a stray Arab
in the deserts of the Euphrates If Im alivemind you aliveIll be
at Cunnamulla on the day I mean And now goodbye old fellow Whatever
my sins have been Ive been true to you and your people in the past
and if Aileen and I meet across the seas as I hope the new life may
partly atone for the old one




Chapter 49



He shook hands with me and dad threw his leg over Rainbow took
Lockets bridle as if he was going for an easy days ride and cantered
off

Warrigal nodded to both of us then brought his packhorse up level and
followed up

There goes the Captain says father Its hard to say if well ever
see him again I shant anyhow nor you either maybe Somehow Ive
had a notion coming over me this good while as my time aint going to be
long It dont make no odds neither Life aint no great chop to a man
like me not when he gets the wrong side o sixty anyhow Mine aint
been such a bad innings and I dont owe much to any man I mean as Ive
mostly been square with them thats done me a bad turn No man can say
Ben Marston was ever backard in that way and never will be thats
more No them as trod on me felt my teeth some day or other Eh old
man Crib growled He understood things regular like a Christian that
old dog did And now youre agoin off and Jims goneseems only
tother day as you and he was little toddlin chaps runnin to meet me
when I come home from work clearin that fust paddock and telling me
mammy had the tea ready Perhaps Id better ha stuck to the grubbin
and clearin after all It looked slow work but it paid better than
this here in the long run Father turns away from me then and walks
back a step or two Then he faces me Dash it boy what are ye waitin
for Shake hands and tell Jim the old man hant forgot him yet

It was many a day since Id felt fathers hand in kindness he didnt
do them sort of things I held out mine and his fingers closed on it one
minute like a viceblest if I didnt expect to feel the bones grate
agin one another he was that strong he hardly knew his own strength I
believe Then he sits down on the log by the fire He took out his pipe
but somehow it wouldnt light Goodbye Crib says I The old dog
looked at me for a bit wagged his tail and then went and sat between
dads knees I took my horse and rode away slowish I felt all dead and
alive like when I got near the turn in the track I looked back and seen
the dog and him just the same I started both horses then I never set
eyes on him again Poor old dad

I wasnt very gay for a bit but I had a good horse under me another
alongside a smartish lot of cash in notes and gold some bank deposits
too and all the world before me My dart now was to make my way to
Willaroon and look sharp about it My chance of getting through was none
too good but I settled to ride a deal at night and camp by day I began
to pick up my spirits after I got on the road that led up the mountain
and to look ahead to the time when I might call myself my own man again

Next day after that I was at Willaroon I could have got there
overnight but it looked better to camp near the place and come next
morning There I was all right The overseer was a reasonable sort of
man and I found old George had been as good as his word and left word
if a couple of men like me and Starlight came up we were to be put on
with the next mob of cattle that were going to Queensland He did a
store cattle trade with the farout squatters that were stocking up new
country in Queensland and it paid him very well as nearly everything
did that he touched We were to find our own horses and be paid so much
a weekthree pounds I thinkand so on

As luck would have it there was a biggish mob to start in a week and
road hands being scarce in that part the overseer was disappointed that
my mate as he called him hadnt come on but I said hed gone another
track

Well hell hardly get such wages at any other job says he and if I
was Mr Storefield I wouldnt hire him again not if he wanted a billet
ever so bad

I dont suppose he will says I and serves him quite right too

I put my horses in the paddockthere was wild oats and crowsfoot
kneehigh in itand helped the overseer to muster and draft He gave me
a fresh horse of course When he saw how handy I was in the yard he got
quite shook on me and says he

By George youre just the chap the boss wants to send out to some new
country hes going to take up in Queensland Whats your name Now I
think of it he didnt tell me

William Turner says I

Very well William says he youre a dashed good man I can see and
I wish I could pick up a few more like you Blessed if I ever saw such a
lot of duffers in my life as there are on this side Ive hardly seen a
man come by thats worth his grub You couldnt stop till the next mob
starts I suppose Id make it worth your while

I couldnt well this time says I my mates got a friend out north
just from home and were tied to time to meet him But if I come back
this way Ill put in a year with you

Well an offers an offer says he I cant say more but I think
youll do better by stopping on here

I got away with the cattle all right and the drover in charge was told
to do all he could for me The overseer said I was as good as two men
and it was Bill here and William there all the time till we were
off I wasnt sorry to be clear away for of course any day a trooper
might have ridden up and asked questions about the horses that were a
little too good for a working drover

Besides Id had a look at the papers and I saw that Starlight had been
as good as his word in the matter of the advertisement Sure enough
the Turon Star and a lot of other papers had on the same day
received the same advertisement with a pound note enclosed and
instructions to insert it four times


 NOTICE

 To all whom it may concern

 The Messrs Marston Brothers and Co being about to leave the district
 request that all accounts against them may be sent to the Police Camp
 Turon addressed to the care of Sir Ferdinand Morringer whose receipt
 will be a sufficient discharge
 For the firm
 Starlight


I couldnt have believed at first that hed be so mad But after a bit I
saw that like a lot of his reckless doings it wasnt so far out after
all

All the papers had taken it up as usual and though some of them were
pretty wild at the insult offered to the Government and so on I could
see theyd most of them come to think it was a blind of some sort meant
to cover a regular big touch that we were going in for close by home
and wanting to throw the police off the scent once more If wed really
wanted to make tracks they said this would be the last thing wed
think of doing Bit by bit it was put about as there should be a
carefully laid plot to stick up all the banks in Turon on the same day
and make a sweep of all the gold and cash

I laughed when I saw this because I knew that it was agreed upon
between Aileen and Gracey that about the time we were fairly started
whichever of them saw Sir Ferdinand first should allow it to be
fished out of her as a great secret that we were working up to some
tremendous big affair of this sort and which was to put the crown on
all our other doings To make dead sure we had sent word to Billy the
Boy and some money too to raise a sham kind of stickingup racket on
the other side of the Turon towards Bathurst way He was to frighten a
few small people that would be safe to talk about it and make out that
all the bushrangers in the country were camped about there This was
the sort of work that the young villain regularly went in for and took
a pleasure in and by the way the papers put it in he had managed to
frighten a lot of travellers and roadside publicans out of their senses
most

As luck would have it Wall and Hulbert and Moran had been working up
towards Mudgee lately and stuck up the mail and as Master Billy thought
it a great lark to ride about with them with a black mask on people
began to think the gangs had joined again and that some big thing
they didnt know what was really on the cards So a lot of police were
telegraphed for and the Bathurst superintendent came down all in a
hurry to the Turon and in the papers nothing went down but telegrams
and yarns about bushrangers They didnt know what the country was
coming to all the sober going people wishing theyd never got an ounce
of gold in Australia and every little storekeeper along the line that
had 100 Pounds in his cashbox hiding it every night and afraid of
seeing us ride up every time the dogs barked

All the time we were heading for Cunnamulla and leaving New South Wales
behind us hand over hand

The cattle of course couldnt travel very fast ten or twelve miles a
day was enough for them I could have drowned myself in the creeks as
we went crawling along sometimes and I that impatient to get forward
Eighty miles it was from Cunnamulla to the Queensland border Once we
were over that wed have to be arrested on warrant and there were lots
of chaps like us that were wanted on the farout north stations
Once we sighted the waters of the Warrego we should feel ourselves more
than half free

Then there was Jim poor old Jim He wrote to say he was just starting
for Melbourne and very queer he felt about leaving his wife and boy
Such a fine little chap as hed grown too Hed just got his head
down he said and taken to the pulling he meant working like our old
nearside poler and he was as happy as a king going home to Jeanie at
night and having his three pounds every Saturday Now he was going away
ever so far by land and sea and God knows when he might see either of
em again If it wasnt for the fear he had of being pitched upon by
the police any day and the long sentence he was sure to get hed stay
where he was He wasnt sure whether he wouldnt do so now

After that Aileen had a letter a short one from Jeanie Jim had gone
She had persuaded him for the sake of the boy though both their hearts
were nearly broken She didnt know whether shed done right Perhaps
she never might see him again The poor fellow had forfeited his coach
fare once and come back to stay another day with her When he did go he
looked the picture of misery and something told her it was their last
parting

Well we struck the river about ten miles this side of Cunnamulla where
there was a roadside inn a small miserable kind of place just one
of those halfshanties halfpublichouses fit for nothing but to trap
bushmen and where the bad grog kills more men in a year than a middling
breakout of fever

Somewhere about here I expected to hear of the other two Wed settled
to meet a few miles one side or the other of the township It didnt
much matter which So I began to look about in case I might get word of
either of em even if they didnt turn up to the time

Somewhere about dinner time twelve oclock we got the cattle on to the
river and let em spread over the flat Then the man in charge rode up
to the inn the Travellers Rest a pretty long rest for some of em as
a grave here and there with four panels of shickery tworail fence round
it showed and shouted nobblers round for us

While we was standing up at the bar waiting for the cove to serve it
out a flashlooking card he was and didnt hurry himself up rides
a tall man to the door hangs up his horse and walks in He had on a
regular town rigwatch and chain leather valise round felt hat like
a chap going to take charge of a store or something I didnt know him
at first but directly our eyes met I saw it was old Jim We didnt
talkno fear and my boss asked him to join us like any other
stranger Just then in comes the landlady to sharpen up the man at the
bar

Havent you served those drinks yet Bob she sings out Why
the gentlemen called for them halfanhour ago I never saw such a
slowgoing crawler as you are Youd never have done for the Turon
boys

We all looked at hernot a badlooking woman shed been once though
you could see shed come down in the world and been knocked about a bit
Surely I knew her voice Id seen her beforewhy of course

She was quicker than I was

Well Dick says she pouring out all the drinks taking the note and
rattling down the change on the counter all in a minute same as Id
often seen her do before this is a rough shop to meet old friends in
isnt it So you didnt know me eh Were both changed a bit You look
pretty fresh on it A woman loses her looks sooner than a man when she
goes to the bad And Jim too she goes on only to fancy poor old
Jim turning up here too One would think youd put it up to meet at the
township on some plant of that sort

It was Kate sure enough How in the world did ever she get here I knew
shed left the Turon and that old Mullockson had dropped a lot of
his money in a big mining company hed helped to float and that never
turned out gold enough to pay for the quicksilver in the first crushing
Wed heard afterwards that hed died and shed married again but I
never expected to see her brought down so low as thisnot but what wed
known many a woman that started on the diggings with silks and satins
and a big house and plateglass windows brought down to a cotton gown
and a bark shanty before halfadozen years were over

Jim and I both looked queer The men began to laugh Any one could see
we were both in a fix Jim spoke first

Are you sure youre not making a mistake missis says he looking at
her very quietlike Take care what you say

Hed better have held his tongue I dont know whether she really
intended to give us away I dont think she did altogether but with
them kind of women its a regular toss up whether theyll behave
reasonable or not When theyre once started specially if they think
theyve not been treated on the square they cant stop themselves

Take care what I say she breaks out rising her voice to a scream
and looking as if shed jump over the barcounter and tear the eyes out
of me Why should I take care Its you Dick Marston you doublefaced
treacherous dog that you are thats got a thousand pounds on your head
that has cause to care and you Jim Marston thats in the same reward
and both of you know it Not that Ive anything against you Jim Youre
a man and always was Ill say that for you

And youre a woman groans out poor Jim Thats the reason you cant
hold your infernal tongue I suppose

Kate had let the cat out of the bag now and no mistake You should have
seen the drover and his men look at us when they found they had the
famous bushrangers among them that theyd all heard so much about this
years past Some looked pretty serious and some laughed The drover
spoke first

Bushranger here or bushranger there he says Im going to lose a
dashed good man among cattle and if this chattering fool of a woman had
held her tongue the pair of ye might have come on with the cattle till
they were delivered Now Im a man short and havent one as I can trust
on a pinch I dont think any more of you missis he says for being
so dashed ready to give away your friends supposing they had been on
the cross

But Kate didnt hear She had fallen down in a kind of fit and her
husband coming in to see what the row was about picked her up and
stood looking at us with his mouth open

Look here my man says I your wifes taken me and this gentleman
pointing to Jim for some people she knew before on the diggings and
seems to have got rather excited over it If it was worth our while to
stay here wed make her prove it Youd better get her to lie down and
advise her when she comes to to hold her tongue or you might be made
to suffer by it

Shes a terror when shes put out and thats Gods truth says the
chap and starting to drag her over to one of the bits of back bedrooms
Its all right I daresay She will keep meddling with what dont
consarn her I dont care who yer are or what yer are If you knowed
her afore I expect yell think it best to clear while shes unsensible
like

Heres a shout all round for these men here says I throwing a note
on the bar Never mind the change Goodbye chaps This gentleman and
I have some business together and theres no bushranging in it you
may take my word

We all left then The men went back to their cattle Jim rode quietly
along the road to Cunnamulla just like any other traveller I went down
and saddled up my horse Id got everything I wanted in my swag so Id
left the other horse at Willaroon

Never mind the settlement says I to the drover Ill be coming back
to the station after Ive finished my business in Queensland and we can
make up the account then

The overseer looked rather doubtful

This seems rather mixed says he Blest if I understand it That
woman at the pub seems half off her head to me I cant think two
quietlooking chaps like you can be the Marstons Youve been a
thundering good road hand anyhow and I wish you luck

He shook hands with me I rode off and kept going along the road till I
overtook Jim

When Id gone a mile or two there was Jim riding steadily along the
road looking very dull and downlike just the way he used to do when
he was studying how to get round a job of work as he wasnt used to He
brightens up a bit when he sees me and we both jumped off and had a
good shakehands and a yarn I told him about mother and Aileen and how
Id left dad all by himself He said Jeanie and the boy were all right
but of course hed never heard of em since and couldnt help feeling
dubersome about meeting her again particular now this blessed woman had
dropped across us and wouldnt keep her mouth shut

As sure as weve had anything to do with her bad lucks followed up
says Jim Id rather have faced a trooper than seen her face again

She cant do much now says I Were across the border I wonder
where Starlight iswhether hes in the township or not As soon as we
meet him we can make straight for the ship

Hes there now says Jim He was at Kates last night

How do you know that

I heard her mutter something about it just when she went into that fit
or whatever it was Devilment I think I never saw such a woman and to
think shes my Jeanies sister

Never mind that Jim These things cant be helped But what did she
say

Something like this He thought I didnt know him passing himself off
as a gentleman Warrigal too Kate Morrisons eyes are too sharp for
that as hell find out

Think shell give us away again Jim

God only knows She mightnt this time unless she wants to smother you
altogether and dont mind who she hurts along with you

Theres one good thing in it says I theres no police nearer than
Trielgerat and its a long days ride to them We made it all right
before we left the Turon All the police in the country is looking for
us on the wrong road and will be for a week or two yet

Then I told him about Aileen putting Sir Ferdinand on the wrong lay and
he said what a clever girl she was and had as much pluck and sense as
two or three men A deal more than weve ever showed Dick says he
and thats not saying much either

He laughed in his quiet way when he heard about Starlights
advertisement in the Turon Star and said it was just like him

Hes a wonderful clever fellow the Captain Ive often thought when
Ive been by myself in Melbourne sitting quiet smoking at night and
turning all these things over that its a wonder he dont shoot himself
when he thinks of what he is and the man he ought to be

Hes head enough to take us safe out of this dashed old Sydney side
says I and land us in another country where well be free and happy
in spite of all thats come and gone If he does that weve no call to
throw anything up to him

Let him do that says Jim and Ill be his servant to the day of my
death But Im afeard it isnt to be any more than going to heaven right
off Its too good somehow to come true and yet what a thing it is
to be leading a working honest life and be afraid of no man I was very
near like that in Melbourne Dick he says youve no notion what a
grand thing it waswhen Id done my weeks work and used to walk about
with Jeanie and her boy on Sundays and pass the time of day with decent
square coves that I knew and never dreamed I was different then the
going home peaceful and contented to our own little cottage I tell you
Dick it was heaven on earth No wonder it regular broke my heart to
leave it

Were close up to the township now says I This wire fence and the
painted gate aint more than a couple of miles off that chap said at
the inn I wish there was a firestick in it and Id never gone inside
a door of it However that says nothing Weve got to meet Starlight
somehow and theres no use in riding in together You go in first and
Ill take a wheel outside the house and meet you in the road a mile or
two ahead Wheres your pistol I must have a look at mine I had to
roll it up in my swag and it wants loading

Mines a good tool says Jim bringing out a splendidlooking
revolverone of these new Dean and Adamss I can make prime shooting
at fifty yards but I hope to God I shant want to use it

Theres no fear yet a bit says I but its as well to be ready Ill
load before we go any farther

I loaded and put her back in the belt We were just going to push on
when we heard the sound of galloping and round a patch of scrub comes
a horseman at full speed When he sees us he cuts off the road and comes
towards us

There was only one horse that carried himself like that even when
he was pulling double We spotted him the same second Rainbow and
Starlight on him What in thunder makes him ride like that

When he came closer we saw by his face that something was up His eyes
had the gloomy dull fire in them that put me in mind of the first time
I saw him when he came back wounded and half dead to the Hollow

Dont stop to talk boys he sings out without stopping but ride
like the devil Head to the left That infernal Warrigal has laid the
police on your track Dick They were seen at Willaroon may be up at
any minute

Wheres Warrigal now I said as we all took our horses by the head
and made for a patch of dark timber we could see far out on the plain

He dropped when I fired at him says Starlight but whether the poor
beggars dead or not I cant say It isnt my fault if he betrays any
one again

How did it come out

I was tired of waiting at that confounded hotelnot a soul to speak
to I rode back as far as Kates just to see if you had passed She
didnt know me a bit

The deuce she didnt Why she broke out on me and Jim Said something
about you and Warrigal too

Wonderful creatures women says he thoughtfullike and yet I used
to think I understood them No time to do anything though

No the nearest police stations a day off Id give a trifle to know
whos after us How did you find out Warrigals doubling on me not that
it matters now dn him

When I talked about going back he was in a terrible fright and raised
so many objections that I saw he had some reason for it so I made him
confess

How did he do it

After wed passed Dandaloo and well inside the West Bogan scrubs he
picked up a blackfellow that had once been a tracker gave him a
pound to let them know at the police camp that you were making out by
Willaroon

I knew he had it in for me said I but I depended on his not doing
anything for fear of hurting you

So I thought too but he expected youd be trapped at Willaroon before
there would be time for you to catch me up If he hadnt met that Jemmy
Wardell I daresay he wouldnt have thought of it When he told me I was
in such an infernal rage that I fired point blank at him didnt wait
to see whether he was dead or alive and rode straight back here to warn
you I was just in timeeh Jim old man Why you look so respectable
theyd never have known you Why didnt you stay where you were James

I wish to God I had says poor old Jim Its too late to think of
that now

We hadnt over much time for talking and had to range up close to do it
at all at the pace we were going We did our best and must have ridden
many a mile before dark Then we kept going through the night Starlight
was pilot and by the compass he carried we were keeping something in a
line with the road But we missed Warrigal in the night work and more
than once I suspected we were going round and not keeping a straight
course

We didnt do badly after all for we struck the main road at daylight
and made out that we were thirty miles the other side of Cunnamulla
and in the right direction The worst of it was like all short cuts
and night riding wed taken about twice as much out of our horses as we
need have done if wed been certain of our line

This ought to be Murrynebone Creek says Starlight by the look of
it when we came to a goodish broad bit of water The crossing place
is boggy so they told me at the hotel We may as well pull up for a
spell Were in Queensland now thats one comfort

It took us all we knew to get over it was a regular quicksand Rainbow
never got flustered if he was up to his neck in a bog but my horse got
frightened and plunged so that I had to jump off Jims horse was a
trifle better but he hadnt much to spare We werent sorry to take the
bridles out of their mouths and let them pick a bit on the flat when we
got safe over

We didnt unsaddle our horsesno fear we never did that only at night
not always then We took the bits out of their mouths and let them pick
feed round about with the bridle under their feet stockhorse fashion
They were all used to it and youd see em put their foot on a rein
and take it off again regular as if they knew all about it We could
run full pelt and catch em all three in a minutes notice old Rainbow
would hold up his head when he saw Starlight coming and wait for him to
mount if there was a hundred horses galloping past Lucky for him hed
done it scores of times once on his back there was no fear of any
other horse overhauling him any more than a coolie dog or a flying doe
kangaroo

Pretty well settled it came to be amongst us that we should be well into
Queensland before the police were handy Starlight and Jim were having a
pitch about the best way to get aboard one of these pearling craft and
how jolly it would be The captains didnt care two straws what sort
of passengers they took aboard so long as they had the cash and were
willing to give a hand when they were wanted

We were just walking towards the horses to make a fresh start when
Starlight puts up his hand We all listened There was no mistaking the
sound we heardhorses at speed and mounted men at that We were in a
sort of angle We couldnt make back over the infernal boggy creek wed
just passed and they seemed to be coming on two sides at once

By theyre on us says Starlight and he cocks his rifle
and walks over quite cool to the old horse Our chance boys is to
exchange shots and ride for it Keep cool dont waste your fire and
if we can drop a couple of them we may slip them yet

We hadnt barely time to get to our horses when out of the timber they
camein two lotsthree on each side Police sure enough and meeting
us That shook us a bit How the devil did they get ahead of us after
the pace wed ridden the last twentyfour hours too When they came
close we could see how it was Sir Ferdinand and three troopers on one
side Inspector Goring with two more on the left while outside not
far from the lead rode Sir Watkin the Braidwood black trackerthe
best hand at that work in the three colonies if you could keep him
sober

Now we could see why they took us in front He had kept out wide when he
saw the tracks were getting hot so as to come in on the road ahead of
us and meet us full in the teeth

He had hit it off well this time blast him We couldnt make back on
account of the creek and we had double our number to fight and good
men too before we could break through if we could do that

Our time was come if we hadnt the devils own luck but we had come out
of as tight a place before and might do it again

When they were within fifty yards Sir Ferdinand calls out Surrender
Its no use men says he I dont want to shoot you down but you
must see youre outnumbered Theres no disgrace in yielding now

Come on says Starlight dont waste your breath Theres no man here
will be taken alive

With that Goring lets drive and sends a bullet that close by my head I
put my hand up to feel the place All the rest bangs away black tracker
and all I didnt see Sir Ferdinands pistol smoke He and Starlight
seemed to wait Then Jim and I fires steady One trooper drops badly
hit and my mans horse fell like a log and penned his rider under him
which was pretty nigh as good

Steady does it says Starlight and he makes a snap shot at the
tracker and breaks his right arm

Three men spoiled says he one more to the good and we may charge

Just as he said this the trooper that was underneath the dead horse
crawls from under him the off side and rests his rifle on his wither
Starlight had just mounted when every rifle and pistol in the two
parties was fired at one volley We had drawn closer to one another and
no one seemed to think of cover

Rainbow rears up gives one spring and falls backward with a crash I
thought Starlight was crushed underneath him shot through the neck and
flank as he was but he saved himself somehow and stood with his hand
on Rainbows mane when the old horse rose again all right head and
tail well up and as steady as a rock The blood was pouring out of his
neck but he didnt seem to care two straws about it You could see his
nostril spread out and his eye looking twice as big and fiery

Starlight rests his rifle a minute on the old horses shoulder and the
man that had fired the shot fell over with a kick Something hits me in
the ribs like a stone and another on the right arm which drops down
just as I was aiming at a young fellow with light hair that had ridden
pretty close up under a myall tree

Jim and Sir Ferdinand let drive straight at one another the same minute
They both meant it this time Sir Ferdinands hat turned part round on
his head but poor old Jim drops forward on his face and tears up the
grass with his hands I knew what that sign meant

Goring rides straight at Starlight and calls on him to surrender He had
his rifle on his hip but he never moved There he stood with his hand
on the mane of the old horse Keep back if youre wise Goring says
he as quiet and steady as if hed been cattledrafting I dont want
to have your blood on my head but if you must

Goring had taken so many men in his day that he was got over
confidentlike He thought Starlight would give in at the last moment or
miss him in the rush My right arm was broken and now that Jim was
down we might both be took which would be a great crow for the police
Anyhow he was a man that didnt know what fear was and he chanced it

Two of the other troopers fired point blank at Starlight as Goring rode
at him and both shots told He never moved but just lifted his rifle
as the other came up at the gallop Goring threw up his arms and rolled
off his horse a dying man

Starlight looked at him for a minute

Were quits he says its not once or twice either youve pulled
trigger on me I knew this day would come

Then he sinks down slowly by the side of the old horse and leans against
his fore leg Rainbow standing quite steady only tossing his head up
and down the old way I could see by the stain on Starlights mouth and
the blood on his breast hed been shot through the lungs

I was badly hit too and going in the head though I didnt feel it so
much at the time I began to hear voices like in a dream then my eyes
darkened and I fell like a log

When I came to all the men was off their horses some round Goringhim
they lifted up and propped against a tree but he was stone dead any
one could see Sir Ferdinand was on his knees beside Starlight talking
to him and the other saying a word now and then quite composed and
quietlike

Close thing Morringer wasnt it I heard him say You were too
quick for us another day and wed been out of reach

True enough Horses all dead beat couldnt raise a remount for love or
money

Well the games up now isnt it Ive held some good cards too but
they never told somehow Im more sorry for Jimandthat poor girl
Aileen than I am for myself

Dont frettheres a good fellow Fortune of war you know Anything
else

Here he closed his eyes and seemed gone but he wakes up again and
begins in a dreamy way His words came slowly but his voice never
altered one bit

Im sorry I fired at poor Warrigal now No dog ever was more faithful
than he has been to me all through till now but I was vexed at his
having sold Dick and poor Jim

We knew we should find you here or hereabouts without that says Sir
Ferdinand

How was that

Two jockeyboys met you one night at Calga gate one of them recognised
Locket by the white patch on her neck He wired to us at the next
station

So you were right after all Dick It was a mistake to take that mare
Ive always been confoundedly obstinate I admit that Too late to think
of it now isnt it

Anything else I can do says Sir Ferdinand

Give her this ring he pulls it off his finger and youll see Maddie
Barnes gets the old horse wont you Poor old Rainbow I know shell
take care of him and a promise is a promise

All right Hes the property of the Government now you know but Ill
square it somehow The General wont object under the circumstances

Then he shuts his eyes for a bit After a while he calls out

Dick Dick Marston

Im here says I

If you ever leave this tell Aileen that her name was the last word I
spokethe very last She foresaw this day she told me so Ive had
a queer feeling too this week back Well its over now I dont know
that Im sorry except for others I say Morringer do you remember the
last pigeon match you and I shot in at Hurlingham

Why good God says Sir Ferdinand bending down and looking into his
face It cant be yes by Jove it is

He spoke some name I couldnt catch but Starlight put a finger on his
lips and whispers

You wont tell will you Say you wont

The other nodded

He smiled just like his old self

Poor Aileen he says quite faint His head fell back Starlight was
dead




Chapter 50



The breath was hardly out of him when a horse comes tearing through the
scrub on to the little plain with a man on his back that seemed hurt
bad or drunk he rolled in his saddle so The head of him was bound up
with a white cloth and what you could see of it was darklooking with
bloodstains on it I knew the figure and the seat on a horse though I
couldnt see his face He didnt seem to have much strength but he was
one of those sort of riders that cant fall off a horse that is unless
theyre dead Even then youd have to pull him down I believe hed hang
on somehow like a dead possum on a branch

It was Warrigal

They all knew him when he came close up but none of the troopers raised
their pieces or thought of stopping him If a dead man had rode right
into the middle of us hed have looked like that He stopped his horse
and slipped off on his feet somehow

Hed had a dreadful wound any one could see There was blood on the
rags that bound his head all up and being round his forehead and over
his chin it made him look more and more like a corpse Not much you
could see only his eyes that were burning bright like two coals of
fire

Up to Starlights body he goes and sits himself down by it He takes
the dead mans head into his lap looks down at the face and bursts out
into the awfullest sort of crying and lamenting I ever heard of a living
man Ive seen the native women mourning for their dead with the blood
and tears running down their faces together Ive known them sit for
days and nights without stirring from round a corpse not taking a bite
or sup the whole time Ive seen white people thats lost an only child
that had maybe been all life and spirits an hour before But in all
my life I have never seen no man nor woman neither show such regular
rightdown grief as Warrigal did for his masterthe only human creature
he loved in the wide world and him lying stiff on the ground before
him

He lifts up the dead face and wipes the blood from the lips so careful
talks to it in his own language or leastways his mothers like a woman
over a child Then he sobbed and groaned and shook all over as if the
very life was going out of him At last he lays the head very soft and
gentle down on the ground and looks round Sir Ferdinand gives him his
handkerchief and he lays it over the face Then he turns away from the
men that stood round and got up looking that despairing and wretched
that I couldnt help pitying him though he was the cause of the whole
thing as far as we could see

Sudden as a flash of powder he pulls out a small revolvera
DerringerStarlight gave him once and holds it out to me buttend
first

You shoot me Dick Marston you shoot me quick he says Its all my
fault I killed himI killed the Captain I want to die and go with him
to the nevernever country parson tell us aboutup there

One of the troopers knocked his hand up Sir Ferdinand gave a nod and a
pair of handcuffs were slipped over his wrists

You told the police the way I went says I Its all come out of
that

Thought theyd grab you at Willaroon says he looking at me quite
sorrowful with his dark eyes like a child If you hadnt knocked me
down that last time Dick Marston Id never have done nothing to you
nor Jim I forgot about the old down That brought it all back again
I couldnt help it and when I see Jimmy Wardell I thought theyd catch
you and no one else

Well youve made a clean sweep of the lot of us Warrigal says I
poor Jim and all Dont you ever show yourself to the old man or go
back to the Hollow if you get out of this

Hes dead now Ill never hear him speak again says he looking over
to the figure on the grass Whats the odds about me

     

I didnt hear any more I must have fainted away again Things came into
my head about being taken in a cart back to Cunnamulla with Jim
lying dead on one side of me and Starlight on the other I was only
halfsensible I expect Sometimes I thought we were alive and another
time that the three of us were dead and going to be buried

What makes it worse Ive seen that sight so often sincethe fight on
the plain and the end of it all Just like a picture it comes back to me
over and over again sometimes in broad day as I sit in my cell in the
darkest midnight in the early dawn

It rises before my eyesthe bare plain and the dead men lying where
they fell Sir Ferdinand on his horse with the troopers standing round
and the halfcaste sitting with Starlights head in his lap rocking
himself to and fro and crying and moaning like a woman thats lost her
child

I can see Jim toolying on his face with his hat rolled off and both
arms spread out wide He never moved after And to think that only the
day before he had thought he might see his wife and child again Poor
old Jim If I shut my eyes they wont go away It will be the last sight
I shall see in this world beforebefore Im

The coroner of the district held an inquest and the jury found a
verdict of justifiable homicide by Sir Ferdinand Morringer and other
members of the police force of New South Wales in the case of one James
Marston charged with robbery under arms and of a man habitually known
as Starlight but of whose real name there was no evidence before the
jury As for the police it was wilful murder against us Warrigal and
I were remanded to Turon Court for further evidence and as soon as we
were patched up a bit by the doctorfor both of us looked like making a
die of it for two or three weekswe were started on horseback with four
troopers overland all the way back We went easy stageswe couldnt
ride any way fastboth of us handcuffed and our horses led

One day about a fortnight after as we were crossing a river
Warrigals horse stopped to drink It was a swim in the middle of the
stream and the trooper who was a young chap just from the depot let
go his leading rein for a bit Warrigal had been as quiet as a lamb all
the time and they hadnt a thought of his playing up I heard a splash
and looked round his horses head was turned to the bank and before
the trooper could get out of the river he was into the river scrub and
away as fast as his horse could carry him Both the troopers went after
him and we waited halfanhour and then went on to the next police
station to stop till they came back

Next day late they rode in with their horses regularly done and
knocked up leading his horse but no Warrigal He had got clear away
from them in the scrub jumped off his horse when they were out of
sight taken off his boots and made a straight track for the West Bogan
scrub There was about as much chance of running him down there as a
brumbie with a days start or a wallaroo that was seen on a mountain
side the week before last I didnt trouble my head that much to think
whether I was glad or sorry What did it matter What did anything
matter now The only two men I loved in the world were dead the two
women I loved best left forsaken and disgraced and Iwell I was on my
way to be hanged

I was taken along to Turon and put into the gaol there to await my
trial They didnt give me much of a chance to bolt and I wouldnt have
taken it if they had I was dead tired of my life and wouldnt have
taken my liberty then and there if theyd given it me All I wanted was
to have the whole thing done and over without any more bother

It all passed like a dream The court was crowded till there wasnt
standing room every one wanting to get a look at Dick Marston the
famous bushranger The evidence didnt take so very long I was proved
to have been seen with the rest the day the escort was robbed the
time the four troopers were shot I was suspected of being concerned in
Hagans partys death and halfadozen other things Last of all when
SubInspector Goring was killed and a trooper besides two others badly
wounded

I was sworn to as being one of the men that fired on the police I
didnt hear a great deal of it but livened up when the judge put on
his black cap and made a speech not a very long one telling about
the way the law was set at naught by men who had dared to infest the
highways of the land and rob peaceful citizens with arms and violence
In the pursuit of gain by such atrocious means blood had been shed and
murder wilful murder had been committed He would not further allude
to the deeds of blood with which the prisoner at the bar stood charged
The only redeeming feature in his career had been brought out by the
evidence tendered in his favour by the learned counsel who defended him
He had fought fairly when opposed by the police force and he had
on more than one occasion acted in concert with the robber known as
Starlight and the brother James Marston both of whom had fallen in a
recent encounter to protect from violence women who were helpless
and in the power of his evil companions Then the judge pronounced the
sentence that I Richard Marston was to be taken from the place whence
I came and there hanged by the neck until I was dead And might God
have mercy upon my soul

My lawyer had beforehand argued that although I had been seen in the
company of persons who had doubtless compassed the unlawfully slaying
of the Queens lieges and peace officers yet no proof had been brought
before the court that day that I had wilfully killed any one He was
not aware would his Honour remark that any one had seen me fire at
any man whether since dead or alive He would freely admit that I had
been seen in bad company but that fact would not suffice to hang a man
under British rule It was therefore incumbent on the jury to bring in a
verdict for his client of not guilty

But that cock wouldnt fight I was found guilty by the jury and
sentenced to death by the judge I expect I was taken back without
seeing or hearing to the gaol and I found myself alone in the condemned
cell with heavy legironsworn for the first time in my life The
rough and tumble of a bushrangers life was over at last and this was
the finish up

For the first week or two I didnt feel anything particular I was
hardly awake Sometimes I thought I must be dreamingthat this man
sitting in a cell quiet and dulllooking with heavy irons on his
limbs could never be Dick Marston the shearer the stockrider the
goldminer the bushranger

This was the endthe endthe end I used to call it out sometimes
louder and louder till the warder would come in to see if I had gone
mad

Bit by bit I came to my right senses I almost think I felt sharper and
clearer in my head than I had done for ever so long Then I was able to
realise the misery I had come down to after all our blowing and roving
This was the crushyard and no gateway I was safe to be hanged in six
weeks or thereaboutshanged like a dog Nothing could alter that and
I didnt want it if it could

And how did the others get on those that had their lives bound up with
ours so that we couldnt be hurt without their bleeding almost in
their heartsthat is mothers bled to death at any rate when she
heard of Jims death and my being taken it broke her heart clean she
never held her head up after Aileen told me in her letter she used to
nurse his baby and cry over him all day talking about her dear boy Jim
She was laid in the buryingground at St Kilda As to Aileen she had
long vowed herself to the service of the Virgin She knew that she was
committing sin in pledging herself to an earthly love She had been
punished for her sin by the death of him she loved and she had settled
in her mind to go into the convent at Soubiaca where she should be able
to wear out her life in prayer for those of her blood who still lived
as well as for the souls of those who lay in the little buryingground
on the banks of the far Warrego

Jeanie settled to stop in Melbourne She had money enough to keep her
comfortable and her boy would be brought up in a different style from
his father

As for Gracey she sent me a letter in which she said she was like the
bird that could only sing one song She would remain true to me in life
and death George was very kind and would never allow any one to speak
harshly of his former friends We must wait and make the best of it

So I was able you see to get bits of news even in a condemned cell
from time to time about the outside world I learned that Wall and
Hulbert and Moran and another fellow were still at large and following
up their old game Their time like ours was drawing short though

     

Well this has been a thundering long yarn hasnt it All my whole life
I seem to have lived over again It didnt take so long in the telling
its a month today since I began And this life itself has reeled away
so quick it hardly seems a dozen years instead of sevenandtwenty
since it began It wont last much longer Another week and it will
be over Theres a fellow to be strung up before me for murdering his
wife The scoundrel I wonder how he feels

Ive had visitors too some I never thought to see inside this gaol
wall One day who should come in but Mr Falkland and his daughter
There was a young gentleman with them that they told me was an English
lord a baronet or something of that sort and was to be married to
Miss Falkland She stood and looked at me with her big innocent eyes so
pitiful and kindlike I could have thrown myself down at her feet
Mr Falkland talked away and asked me about this and that He seemed
greatly interested When I told him about the last fight and of poor
Jim being shot dead and Starlight dying alongside the old horse the
tears came into Miss Falklands eyes and she cried for a bit quite
feeling and natural

Mr Falkland asked me all about the robbery at Mr Knightleys and took
down a lot of things in his pocketbook I wondered what he did that
for

When they said goodbye Mr Falkland shook hands with me and said he
hoped to be able to do some good for me but not to build anything on
the strength of it

Then Miss Falkland came forward and held out her beautiful hand to
meto me as sure as you livelike a regular thoroughbred angel as
she always was It very nigh cooked me I felt so queer and strange I
couldnt have spoken a word to save my life

Sir George or whatever his name was didnt seem to fancy it over much
for he said

You colonists are strange people Our friend here may think himself
highly favoured

Miss Falkland turned towards him and held up her head looking like a
queen as she was and says she

If you had met me in the last place where I saw this man and his
brother you would not wonder at my avowing my gratitude to both of
them I should despise myself if I did not Poor Jim saved my life on
one occasion and on another but far more dreadful day hebut
words mere words can never express my deep thankfulness for his noble
conduct and were he here now I would tell him so and give him my hand
if all the world stood by

Sir George didnt say anything after that and she swept out of the
cell followed by Mr Falkland and him It was just as well for him to
keep a quiet tongue in his head I expect she was a great heiress as
well as a great beauty and people of that sort Ive found mostly get
listened to when they speak When the door shut I felt as if Id seen
the wings of an angel flit through it and the prison grew darker and
darker like the place of lost souls




Chapter 51



One day I was told that a lady wanted to see me When the door of the
cell opened who should walk in but Aileen I didnt look to have seen
her I didnt bother my head about who was coming What did it matter
as I kept thinking who came or who went for the week or two that was to
pass before the day Yes the day that Thursday when poor Dick Marston
would walk over the threshold of his cell and never walk over one
again

The warderhim that stopped with me day and nightevery man in the
condemned cell has to be watched like thatstepped outside the door and
left us together We both looked at one another She was dressed all in
black and her face was that pale I hardly knew her at first Then she
said Oh Dickmy poor Dick is this the way we meet and flings
herself into my arms How she cried and sobbed to be sure The tears
ran down her cheeks like rain and every time the legirons rattled she
shook and trembled as if her heart was breaking

I tried to comfort her it was no use

Let me cry on Dick she said I have not shed a tear since I first
heard the newsthe miserable truth that has crushed all our vain hopes
and fancies my heart has nearly burst for want of relief This will do
me good To thinkto think that this should be the end of all But
it is just I cannot dare to doubt Heavens mercy What else could
we expect living as we all didin sinin mortal sin I am punished
rightly

She told me all about poor mothers death She never held up her head
after she heard of Jims death She never said a hard word about any
one It was Gods will she thought and only for His mercy things
might have gone worse The only pleasure she had in her last days was
in petting Jims boy He was a fine little chap and had eyes like his
father poor old Jim Then Aileen broke down altogether and it was a
while before she could speak again

Jeanie was the same as she had been from the first only so quiet they
could hardly know how much she felt She wouldnt leave the little
cottage where she had been so happy with Jim and liked to work in
the chair opposite to where Jim used to sit and smoke his pipe in the
evenings Most of her friends lived in Melbourne and she reckoned to
stay there for the rest of her life

As to father they had never heard a word from himhardly knew whether
he was dead or alive There was some kind of report that Warrigal
had been seen making towards Nulla Mountain looking very weak and
miserable on a knockedup horse but they did not know whether it was
true or false

Poor Aileen stopped till we were all locked up for the night She seemed
as if she couldnt bear to leave me She had no more hope or tie in
life she said I was the only one of her people she was likely to see
again and this was the last timethe last time

Oh Dick oh my poor lost brother she said how clearly I seem to
see all things now Why could we not do so before I have had my sinful
worldly dream of happiness and death has ended it When I heard of his
death and Jims my heart turned to stone All the strength I have shall
be given to religion from this out I can ease my heart and mortify the
flesh for the good of my soul To Godto the Holy Virginwho hears
the sorrows of such as me I can pray day and night for their souls
welfarefor mine for yours And oh Dick think when that day that
dreadful day comes that Aileen is praying for youwill pray for you
till her own miserable life ends And now goodbye we shall meet on
this earth no more Praysay that you will praypray now that we may
meet in heaven

She half drew me to my knees She knelt down herself on the cold stone
floor of the cell and IwellI seemed to remember the old days when
we were both children and used to kneel down by mothers bed the three
of us Aileen in the middle and one of us boys on each side The old
time came back to me and I cried like a child

I wasnt ashamed of it and when she stood up and said
Goodbyegoodbye Dick I felt a sort of rushing of the blood to my
head and all my wounds seemed as if they would break out again I very
near fell down what with one thing and another I sat myself down on my
bed and I hid my face in my hands When I looked up she was gone

     

After that day after day went on and I scarcely kept count until
somehow I found out it was the last week They partly told me on the
Sunday The parsona good straight manly man he washe had me told
for fear I should go too close up to it and not have time to prepare

Prepare How was a man like me to prepare Id done everything Id a
mind to for years and years Some good thingssome badmostly bad
How was I to repent Just to say I was sorry for them I wasnt that
particular sorry eitherthat was the worst of it A deal of the old
life was dashed good fun and Id not say if I had the chance that I
wouldnt do just the same over again

Sometimes I felt as if I ought to understand what the parson tried to
hammer into my head but I couldnt do anything but make a jumble of
it It came natural to me to do some things and I did them If I had
stopped dead and bucked at fathers wanting me and Jim to help duff
those weaners I really believe all might have come right Jim said
afterwards hed made up his mind to have another try at getting me to
join with George Storefield in that fencing job After that we could
have gone into the outside station work with himjust the thing that
would have suited the pair of us and what a grand finish we might have
made of it if we ran a waiting race and where were we nowJim dead
Aileen dead to the world and me to be hanged on Thursday poor mother
dead and brokenhearted before her time We couldnt have done worse We
might we must have done better

I did repent in that sort of way of all wed done since that first wrong
turn Its the wrong turnoff that makes a man lose his way but as for
the rest I had only a dull heavy feeling that my time was come and I
must make the best of it and meet it like a man

So the day came The last day What a queer feeling it was when I lay
down that night that I should never want to sleep again or try to do
it That I had seen the sun setleastways the day grow darkfor the
last time the very last time

Somehow I wasnt that much in fear of it as you might think it was
strange like but made one pull himself together a bit Thousands and
millions of people had died in all sorts of ways and shapes since the
beginning of the world Why shouldnt I be able to go through with it
like another

I was a long time lying and thinking before I thought of sleeping All
the small teeny bits of a mans life as well as the big seemed to
come up before me as I lay therethe first things I could recollect
at Rocky Flat then the pony mother a youngish woman father always
hardlooking but so different from what he came to be afterwards
Aileen a little girl with her dark hair falling over her shoulders
then a grown woman riding her own horse and full of smiles and fun
then a pale weeping woman all in black looking like a mourner at a
funeral Jim too and Starlightnow galloping along through the forest
at nightlaughing drinking enjoying themselves at Jonathan Barness
with the bright eyes of Bella and Maddie shining with fun and devilment

Then both of them lying dead at the flat by Murrynebone CreekStarlight
with the halfcaste making his wild moan over him Jim quiet in death
as in life lying in the grass looking as if he had slid off his horse
in that hot weather to take a banje and now no get away the ropethe
hangman

I must have gone to sleep after all for the sun was shining into the
cell when I stirred and I could see the chains on my ankles that I had
worn all these weary weeks How could I sleep but I had for all that
It was daylight more than thatsunrise I listened and sure enough
I heard two or three of the bushbirds calling It reminded me of being
a boy again and listening to the birds at dawn just before it was time
to get up When I was a boywas I ever a boy How long was it agoand
nowO my God my God That ever it should have come to this What am
I waiting for to hear now The tread of men the smith that knocks
the irons off the limbs that are so soon to be as cold as the jangling
chains Yes at last I hear their footstepshere they come

The warder the blacksmith the parson the head gaoler just as I
expected The smith begins to cut the rivets Somehow they none of them
look so solemn as I expected Surely when a man is to be killed by law
choked to death in cold blood people might look a bit serious Mind
you I believe men ought to be hanged I dont hold with any of that rot
that them as commits murder shouldnt pay for it with their own lives
Its the only way they can pay for it and make sure they dont do it
again Some men can stand anything but the rope Prison walls dont
frighten them but Jack Ketch does They cant gammon him

Knock off his irons quick says Mr Fairleigh the parson he will
not want them again just yet

I didnt think you would make a joke of that sort sir says I Its
a little hard on a man aint it But we may as well take it cheerful
too

Tell him all Mr Strickland he says to the head gaoler I see he
can bear it now

Prisoner Richard Marston says the gaoler standing up before me it
becomes my duty to inform you that owing to representations made in
your favour by the Hon Mr Falkland the Hon Mr Storefield and other
gentlemen who have interested themselves in your case setting forth
the facts that although mixed up with criminals and known to be present
when the escort and various other cases of robbery under arms have taken
place wherein life has been taken there is no distinct evidence
of your having personally taken life On the other hand in several
instances yourself with the late James Marston and the deceased person
known as Starlight have aided in the protection of life and property
The Governor and the Executive Council have therefore graciously been
pleased to commute your sentence of death to that of fifteen years
imprisonment

     

When I came to I was lying on my blankets in a different cell as I
could see by the shape of it The irons didnt rattle when I moved I
was surprised when I looked and saw they were took off Bit by bit it
all came back to me I was not to be hanged My life was saved if it
was worth saving by the two or three good things wed done in our time
and almost I thought more for poor old Jims sake than my own

Was I glad or sorry now it was all over I hardly knew For a week or
two I felt as if theyd better have finished me off when I was ready and
ha done with me but after a while I began to feel different Then the
gaoler talked to me a bit He never said much to prisoners and what he
said he meant

Prisoner Marston says he youd better think over your situation
and dont mope Make up your mind like a man You may have friends that
youd like to live for Pull yourself together and face your sentence
like a man Youre a young man now and you wont be an old one when
youre let out If your conduct is uniformly good youll be out in
twelve years Settle yourself to serve thatand youre a lucky man to
have no moreand you may have some comfort in your life yet

Then he went out He didnt wait to see what effect it had on me If
I wasnt a fool he thought to himself I must take it in if I was
nothing would do me any good

I took his advice and settled myself down to think it over It was a
good whilea weary lot of years to wait year by yearbut still if I
got out in twelve years I should not be so out and out broke down after
allnot much over forty and theres a deal of life for a man sometimes
after that

And then I knew that there would be one that would be true to me anyhow
that would wait for me when I went out and that would not be too proud
to join in her life with mine for all that had come and gone Well
this might give me strength I dont think anything else could and from
that hour I made up my mind to tackle it steady and patient to do the
best I could and to work out my sentence thankful for the mercy that
had been showed me and if ever a man was in this world resolved to
keep clear of all cross ways for the future

So I began to steady myself and tried to bear it the best way I could
Other men were in for long sentences and they seemed to be able to keep
alive so why shouldnt I Just at the first I wasnt sure whether I
could Year after year to be shut up there with the grass growin and
the trees wavin outside and the world full of people free to walk or
ride to work or play people that had wives and children and friends
and relationsit seemed awful That I should be condemned to live in
this shutup tomb all those long weary years and there was nothing
else for it I couldnt eat or sleep at first and kept starting up at
night thinking they was coming for me to carry me off to the gallows
Then Id dream that Jim and Starlight was alive and that wed all got
out of gaol and were riding through the bush at night to the Hollow
again Then Id wake up and know they were dead and I was here Time
after time Ive done that and I was that broken down and low that I
burst out crying like a child




Chapter 52



The months went on till I began to think it was a long time since
anything had been heard of father I didnt expect to have a letter or
anything but I knew he must take a run outside now and again and so
sure as he did it would come to my ears somehow

One day I had a newspaper passed in to me It was against the
regulations but I did get it for all that and this was the first thing
I saw


 STRANGE DISCOVERY IN THE TURON DISTRICT

A remarkable natural formation leading to curious results was last
week accidentally hit upon by a party of prospectors and by them made
known to the police of the district It may tend to solve the doubts
which for the last few years have troubled the public at large
with respect to the periodical disappearance of a certain gang of
bushrangers now broken up

Accident led the gold miners who were anxious to find a practicable
track to the gullies at the foot of Nulla Mountain to observe a narrow
winding way apparently leading over the brow of the precipice on its
western face To their surprise half hidden by a fallen tree they
discovered a difficult but practicable track down a gully which finally
opened out into a broad wellgrassed valley of considerable extent in
which cattle and horses were grazing

No signs of human habitation were at first visible but after a patient
search a cave in the eastern angle of the range was discovered Fires
had been lighted habitually near the mouth and near a log two saddles
and bridleslong unusedlay in the tall grass Hard by was stretched
the body of a man of swarthy complexion Upon examination the skull was
found to be fractured as if by some blunt instrument A revolver of
small size lay on his right side

Proceeding to the interior of the cave which had evidently been used
as a dwelling for many years past they came upon the corpse of another
man in a sitting posture propped up against the wall One arm rested
upon an empty spiritkeg beside which were a tin pannikin and a few
rude cooking utensils At his feet lay the skeleton of a dog The whole
group had evidently been dead for a considerable time Further search
revealed large supplies of clothes saddlery arms and ammunitionall
placed in recesses of the cavebesides other articles which would
appear to have been deposited in that secure receptacle many years
since

As may be imagined a large amount of interest and even excitement
was caused when the circumstances as reported to the police became
generally known A number of our leading citizens together with many
of the adjoining station holders at once repaired to the spot No
difficulty was felt in identifying the bodies as those of Ben Marston
the father of the two bushrangers of that name and of Warrigal the
halfcaste follower always seen in attendance upon the chief of the
gang the celebrated Starlight

How the last members of this wellknown longdreaded gang of
freebooters had actually perished can only be conjectured but taking
the surrounding circumstances into consideration and the general
impression abroad that Warrigal was the means of putting the police upon
the track of Richard Marston which led indirectly to the death of his
master and of James Marston the most probable solution would seem to
be that after a deep carouse the old man had taxed Warrigal with his
treachery and brained him with the American axe found close to the body
He had apparently then shot himself to avoid a lingering death the
bullet found in his body having been probably fired by the halfcaste as
he was advancing upon him axe in hand

The dog well known by the name of Crib was the property and constant
companion of Ben Marston the innocent accomplice in many of his most
daring stockraids Faithful unto the end with the deep uncalculating
love which shames so often that of man the dumb follower had apparently
refused to procure food for himself and pined to death at the feet of
his dead master Though the philanthropist may regret the untimely
and violent end of men whose courage and energy fitted them for better
things it cannot be denied that the gain to society far exceeds the
loss

When the recesses of the Hollow were fully explored traces of rude but
apparently successful gold workings were found in the creeks which
run through this romantic valleylong as invisible as the fabled gold
cities of Mexico

We may venture to assert that no great time will be suffered to elapse
ere the whole of the alluvial will be taken up and the Terrible Hollow
which some of the older settlers assert to be its real name will
reecho with the sound of pick and shovel perhaps to be the means
of swelling those escorts which its former inhabitants so materially
lessened

With regard to the stock pasturing in the valley a puzzling problem
presented itself when they came to be gathered up and yarded The
adjoining settlers who had suffered from the depredations of the
denizens of the Hollow were gladly expectant of the recovery of animals
of great value To their great disappointment only a small number
of the very aged bore any brand which could be sworn to and legally
claimed The more valuable cattle and horses evidently of the choicest
quality and the highest breeding resembled very closely individuals of
the same breed stolen from the various proprietors But they were either
unbranded or branded with a letter and numbers to which no stockowners
in the district could lay claim

Provoking as well as perplexing was this unique state of
matterswholly without precedent For instance Mr Rouncival and his
studgroom could almost have sworn to the big slashing brown mare the
image of the longlost celebrity Termagant with the same crooked blaze
down the face the same legs the same high croup and peculiar way of
carrying her head She corresponded exactly in age to the date on which
the grand thoroughbred mare just about to bring forth had disappeared
from Buntagong No reasonable doubt existed as to the identity of this
valuable animal followed as she was by several of her progeny equally
aristocratic in appearance Still as these interesting individuals had
never been seen by their rightful owners it was impossible to prove a
legal title

The same presumptive certainty and legal incompleteness existed
concerning Mr Bowes shorthorns as he averred and Mr Dawsons
Devons

 Thou art so near and yet so far

as a provoking stockrider hummed Finally it was decided by the
officials in charge to send the whole collection to the public pound
when each proprietor might become possessed of his own with a good and
lawful title in additionfor a considerationand to the material
benefit of the Government coffers


So it was this way the poor old Hollow was dropped on to and the
wellhidden secret blown for ever and ever Well it had been a good
plant for us and them as had it before our time I dont expect therell
ever be such a place again take it all round

And that was the end of father Poor old dad game to the last And the
dog toowouldnt touch bit or sup after the old man dropped Just
like Crib that was Often and often I used to wonder what he saw in
father to be so fond of him He was about the only creature in the wide
world that was fond of dadexcept mother perhaps when she was young
Shed rather got wore out of her feelings for him too But Crib stuck
to him to his endfaithful till death as some of them writing coves
says

And Warrigal I could see it all sticking out as plain as a fresh track
after rain Hed come back to the Hollow like a foolin spite of me
warning himor because he had nowhere else to go And the first time
dad had an extra glass in his head he tackled him about giving me away
and being the means of the other twos death Then hed got real mad and
run at him with the axe Warrigal had fired as he came up and hit him
too but couldnt stop him in the rush Dad got in at him and knocked
his brains out there and then Afterwards hed sat down and drank
himself pretty well blind and then finding the pains coming on
him and knowing he couldnt live finished himself off with his own
revolver

It was just the way I expected he would make an ending He couldnt do
much all alone in his line The reward was a big one and there would be
always some one ready to earn it Jim and Starlight were gone and I
was as good as dead There wasnt much of a call for him to keep alive
Anyhow he died game and paid up all scores as he said himself

     

I dont know that theres much more for me to say Here I am boxed up
like a scrubber in a pound year after yearand years after thatfor I
dont know how long However O my God how ever shall I stand it Here
I lie half my time in a place where the sun never shines locked up at
five oclock in my cell and the same door with never a move in it till
six oclock next morning A few hours walk in a prison yard with
a warder on the wall with a gun in his hand overhead Then locked up
again Sundays and weekdays no difference Sometimes I think theyd
better have hanged me right off If I feel all these things now Ive
only been a few months doing my sentence how about next year and the
year after that and so on and so on Why it seems as if it would
mount up to more than a mans lifeto ten livesand then to think how
easy it might all have been saved

Theres only one thing keeps me alive only for that Id have starved to
death for want of having the heart to eat or drink either or else have
knocked my brains out against the wall when one of them low fits came
over me That one things the thought of Gracey Storefield

She couldnt come to me she wrote just yet but shed come within the
month and I wasnt to fret about her because whether it was ten years
or twenty years if she was alive shed meet me the day after I was free
let who will see her I must be brave and keep up my spirits for her
sake and Aileens who though she was dead to the world would hear of
my being out and would always put my name in her prayers Neither
she nor I would be so very old and we might have many years of life
reasonably happy yet in spite of all that had happened So the less I
gave way and made myself miserable the younger I should look and feel
when I came out She was sure I repented truly of what I had done wrong
in the past and she for one and Georgegood old kind Georgehad
said he would go bail that I would be one of the squarest men in the
whole colony for the future So I was to live on and hope and pray God
to lighten our lot for her sake

     

It must be years and years since that time as I last wrote about Awful
long and miserable the time went at first now it dont go so slow
somehow I seemed to have turned a corner How long is it It must be a
hundred years I have had different sorts of feelings Sometimes I feel
ashamed to be alive I think the man that knocked his head against the
wall of his cell the day he was sentenced and beat his brains out in
this very gaol had the best of it Other times I take things quite easy
and feel as if I could wait quite comfortable and patientlike till
the day came Butwill it Can it ever come that I shall be a free man
again

People have come to see me a many times most of them the first year
or two I was in After that they seemed to forget me and get tired of
coming It didnt make much odds

But one visitor I had regular after the first month or two Gracey poor
Gracey used to come and see me twice a year She said it wouldnt do
her or me any good to come oftener and George didnt want her to But
them two times she always comes and if it wasnt for that I dont
think Id ever have got through with it The worst of it was I used to
be that low and miserable after she went for days and days after that
it was much as I could do to keep from giving in altogether After a
month was past Id begin to look forward to the next time

When Id done over eleven yearseleven years how did I ever do it but
the time passed and passed somehowI got word that they that I knew
of was making a try to see if I couldnt be let out when Id done twelve
years My regular sentence was fifteen and little enough too Anyhow
they knock off a year or two from most of the longsentence mens time
if theyve behaved themselves well in gaol and can show a good conduct
ticket right through

Well I could do that I was too low and miserable to fight much when
I went in besides I never could see the pull of kicking up rows and
giving trouble in a place like that Theyve got you there fast enough
and any man that wont be at peace himself or let others be is pretty
sure to get the worst of it Id seen others try it and never seen no
good come of it Its like a dog on the chain that growls and bites at
all that comes near him A man can take a sapling and half kill him
and the dog never gets a show unless he breaks his chain and that dont
happen often

Well Id learned carpentering and had a turn at matmaking and a whole
lot of other things They kept me from thinking as I said before and
the neater I did em and the more careful I worked the better it went
with me As for my mats I came quite to be talked about on account of
em I drew a regular good picture of Rainbow and worked it out on a
mat with different coloured thrums and the number of people who came to
see that mat and the notice they took of it would surprise any one

When my twelve years was within a couple of months or so of being up I
began to hear that there was a deal of inandout sort of work about my
getting my freedom Old George Storefield and Mr Falklandboth of em
in the Upper Houseand one or two more people that had some say with
the Government was working back and edge for me There was a party on
the other side that wasnt willing as I should lose a day or an hour of
my sentence and that made out I ought to have been hanged right away
as old Arizona Bill would have said when I was first taken Well
I dont blame any of em for that but if they could have known the
feelings of a man thats done a matter of twelve years and thinks he
mightyes mightsmell the fresh air and feel the grass under his feet
in a week or twowell theyd perhaps consider a bit

Whatever way it came out I couldnt say but the big man of the
Government people at that timethe Minister that had his say in all
these sort of thingstook it into his head that Id had about enough of
it if I was to be let out at all that the steel had been pretty well
taken out of me and that from what he knew of my people and so on I
wasnt likely to trouble the Government again And he was right All I
wanted was to be let out a pardoned man that had done bad things and
helped in worse but had paidand paid dear God knowsfor every pound
hed got crooked and every day hed wasted in cross work If Id been
sent back for them three years I do raly believe something of dads
old savage blood would have come uppermost in me and Id have turned
reckless and revengeful like to my lifes end

Anyhow as I said before the Ministerhed been into the gaol and had
a look once or twicemade up his mind to back me right out and he put
it so before the Governor that he gave an order for my pardon to be made
out or for me to be discharged the day my twelve years was up and to
let off the other three along of my good behaviour in the gaol and all
the rest of it

This leaked out somehow and there was the deuces own barney over it
When some of the Parliament men and them sort of coves in the country
that never forgives anybody heard of it they began to buck and no
mistake Youd have thought every bushranger that ever had been shopped
in New South Wales had been hanged or kept in gaol till he died nothing
but petitions and letters to the papers no end of bobbery The only
paper that had a word to say on the side of a poor devil like me was
the Turon Star He said that Dick Marston and his brother Jim not to
mention Starlight who paid his debts at any rate unlike some people
he could name who had signed their names to this petition had
worked manly and true at the Turon diggings for over a year They were
respected by all who knew them and had they not been betrayed by a
revengeful woman might have lived thenceforth a life of industry and
honourable dealing He for one upheld the decision of the Chief
Secretary Thousands of the Turon miners men of worth and intelligence
would do the same

The Governor hadnt been very long in the colony and they tried it
on all roads to get him to go back on his promise to me They began
bullying and flattering and preaching at him if such a notorious
criminal as Richard Marston was to be allowed to go forth with a
free pardon after a comparatively shortshort think of that
shortimprisonment what a bad example it will be to the rising
generation and so on

They managed to put the thing back for a week or two till I was nearly
drove mad with fretting and being doubtful which way it would go

Lucky for me it was and for some other people as well the Governor was
one of those men that takes a bit of trouble and considers over a thing
before he says yes or no When he says a thing he sticks to it When
he goes forward a step he puts his foot down and all the blowing and
cackle and yelping in the world wont shift him

Whether the Chief Secretary would have taken my side if hed known
what a dust the thing would have raised and how near his Ministersor
whatever they call emwas to going out along with poor Dick Marston
I cant tell Some people say he wouldnt Anyhow he stuck to his word
and the Governor just said hed given his decision about the matter
and he hadnt the least intention of altering itwhich showed he
knew something of the world as well as intended to be true to his own
opinions The whole thing blew over after a bit and the people of the
country soon found out that there wasnt such another Governor barrin
one as the Queen had the sending out of

The day it was all settled the head gaoler comes to me and says he
Richard Marston the Governor and Council has been graciously pleased
to order that you be discharged from her Majestys gaol upon the
completion of twelve years of imprisonment the term of three years
further imprisonment being remitted on account of your uniform good
conduct while in the said gaol You are now free

I heard it all as if it had been the parson reading out of a book about
some other man The words went into my ears and out again I hardly
heard them only the last word freefreefree What a blessed word it
is I couldnt say anything or make a try to walk out I sat down on my
blankets on the floor and wondered if I was going mad The head gaoler
walked over to me and put his hand on my shoulder He was a kind enough
man but from being took in so often he was cautious Come Dick
he says pull yourself together Its a shake for you I daresay but
youll be all right in a day or so I believe youll be another man when
you get out and give the lie to these fellows that say youll be up to
your old tricks in a month Ill back you to go straight if you dont
youre not the man I take you for

I got up and steadied myself I thank you with all my heart Mr
I said Im not much of a talker but youll see youll see thats
the best proof The fools do they think I want to come back here I
wish some of them had a year of it

As soon as there was a chance of my going out I had been allowed to
grow as they call it in there That is to leave off having my face
scraped every morning by the prison barber with his razor that was
sometimes sharp and more times rough enough to rasp the skin off you
particularly if it was a cold morning My hair was let alone too My
clothesthe suit I was taken in twelve years agohad been washed and
cleaned and folded up and put away and numbered in a room with a lot of
others I remember Id got em new just before I started away from the
Hollow They was brought to me and very well they looked too I never
had a suit that lasted that long before

That minds me of a yarn I heard at Jonathan Barness one day There was
a young chap that they used to call Liverpool Jack about then He was
a free kind of fellow and goodlooking and they all took to him He
went away rather sudden and they heard nothing of him for about three
years Then he came back and as it was the busy season old Jonathan put
him on and gave him work It was low water with him and he seemed glad
to get a job

When the old man came in he says Who do you think came up the road
todayLiverpool Jack He looked rather down on his luck so I gave
him a job to mend up the barn Hes a handy fellow I wonder he doesnt
save more money Hes a careful chap too

Careful says Maddie How do ye make that out

Why says Jonathan Im dashed if he aint got the same suit of
clothes on he had when he was here three years ago

The old man didnt tumble but both the girls burst out laughing Hed
been in the jug all the time

I dressed myself in my own clotheshow strange it seemedeven to the
boots and then I looked in the glass I hadnt done that lately I
regularly started back I didnt know myself I came into prison a big
stout brownhaired chap full of life and able to jump over a dray and
bullocks almost I did once jump clean over a pair of polers for a lark

And how was I going out A man with a set kind of face neither one
thing nor the other as if he couldnt be glad or sorry with a fixed
staring look about the eyes a halfyellowish skin with a lot of
wrinkles in it particularly about the eyes and gray hair Big
streaks of gray in the hair of the head and as for my beard it was
whitewhite I looked like an old man and walked like one What was
the use of my going out at all

When I went outside the walls by a small gate the head gaoler shook
hands with me Youre a free man now Dick he says and remember
thisno man can touch you No man has the right to pull you up or lay
a finger on you Youre as independent as the best gentleman in the
land so long as you keep straight Remember that I see theres a friend
waiting for you

Sure enough there was a man that I knew and that lived near Rocky Flat
He was a quiet steadygoing sort of farmer and never would have no
truck with us in our flash times He was driving a springcart with a
good sort of horse in it

Come along with me Dick says he Im going your way and I promised
George Storefield Id call and give you a lift home Im glad to see you
out again and theres a few more round Rocky Flat thats the same

We had a long drivemany a mile to go before we were near home I
couldnt talk I didnt know what to say for one thing I could only
feel as if I was being driven along the road to heaven after coming from
the other place I couldnt help wondering whether it was possible that
I was a free man going back to life and friends and happiness Was it
possible Could I ever be happy again Surely it must be a dream that
would all melt away and Id wake up as Id done hundreds of times and
find myself on the floor of the cell with the bare walls all round me

When we got nearer the old place I began to feel that queer and strange
that I didnt know which way to look It was coming on for spring and
thered been a middling drop of rain seemingly that had made the grass
green and everything look grand What a time had passed over since I
thought whether it was spring or summer or winter It didnt make much
odds to me in there only to drive me wild now and again with thinkin
of what was goin on outside and how I was caged up and like to be for
months and years

Things began little by little to look the way they used to do long and
long ago Now it was an old overhanging limb that had arched over the
road since we were boys then there was a rock with a big kurrajong tree
growing near it When we came to the turn off where we could see Nulla
Mountain everything came back to me I seemed to have had two lives the
old onethen a time when I was dead or next door to itnow this new
life I felt as if I was just born

Well get down here now I said when we came near the dividing fence
it aint far to walk Thats your road

Ill run you up to the door says he it isnt far you aint used to
walking much

He let out his horse and we trotted through the paddock up to the old
hut

The garden dont look bad says he Them peaches always used to bear
well in the old mans time and the apples and quinces too Some ones
had it took care on and tidied up a bit There youve got a friend or
two left old man And Im one too says he putting out his hand and
giving mine a shake There aint any one in these parts as ll cast it
up to you as long as you keep straight You can look em all in the face
now and bygones ll be bygones

Then he touched up his horse and rattled off before I could so much as
say Thank ye

I walked through the garden and sat down in the verandah on one of the
old benches There was the old place mighty little altered considering
The hut had been mended up from time to timenow a slab and then a
sheet of barkelse it would have been down long enough ago The garden
had been dug up and the trees trimmed year by year A hinge had been
put on the old gate and a couple of sliprails at the paddock The
potato patch at the bottom of the garden was sown and there were
vegetables coming on in the old beds Some one had looked after the
place of course I knew who it was

It began to get coldish and I pulled the latchit was there just the
sameand went into the old room I almost expected to see mother in her
chair and father on the stool near the fireplace where he used to sit
and smoke his pipe Aileens was a little low chair near mothers Jim
and I used to be mostly in the verandah unless it was very cold and
then we used to lie down in front of the firethat is if dad was away
as he mostly was

The room felt cold and dark as I looked in So dreadful lonely too I
almost wished I was back in the gaol

When I looked round again I could see things had been left ready for me
so as I wasnt to find myself bad off the first night The fire was all
made up ready to light and matches on the table ready The kettle
was filled and a basket close handy with a leg of mutton and bread
butter eggs and a lot of thingsenough to last me a week The bedroom
had been settled up too and there was a good comfortable bed ready for
any tired man to turn into Better than all there was a letter signed
Your own Gracey that made me think I might have some life left worth
living yet

I lit the fire and after a bit made shift to boil some tea and after
Id finished what little I could eat I felt better and sat down before
the fire to consider over things It was late enoughmidnightbefore
I turned in I couldnt sleep then but at last I must have dropped off
because the sun was shining into the room through the old window with
the broken shutter when I awoke

At first I didnt think of getting up Then I knew all of a sudden
that I could open the door and go out I was in the garden in three
seconds listening to the birds and watching the clouds rising over
Nulla Mountain

     

That morning after breakfast I saw two people a man and a woman come
riding up to the garden gate I knew who it was as far as I could see
emGeorge Storefield and Gracey He lifted her down and they walked
up through the garden I went a step or two to meet them She ran
forward and threw herself into my arms George turned away for a bit
Then I put her by and told her to sit down on the verandah while I had
a talk with George He shook hands with me and said he was glad to see
me a free man again Ive worked a bit and got others to work too
says he mostly for her and partly for your own sake Dick I cant
forget old times Now youre your own man again and I wont insult you
by saying I hope youll keep so I know it as sure as we stand here

Look here George I said as theres a God in heaven no man shall
ever be able to say a word against me again I think more of what youve
done for me almost than of poor Graceys holding fast It came natural
to her Once a woman takes to a man it dont matter to her what he is
But if youd thrown me off Id have not blamed you Whats left of Dick
Marstons life belongs to her and you

     

That day week Gracey and I were married very quiet and private We
thought wed have no one at the little church at Bargo but George and
his wife the old woman and the chap as drove me home Just as we
were going into the church who should come rattling up on horseback
but Maddie Barnes and her husbandMrs Moreton as she was now with a
brightlooking boy of ten or eleven on a pony She jumps off and gives
the bridle to him She looked just the same as ever a trifle stouter
but the same saucy look about the eyes Well Dick Marston says she
how are you Glad to see you old man Youve got him safe at last
Gracey and I wish you joy You came to Bellas wedding Dick and so I
thought Id come to yours though you kept it so awful quiet How dye
think the old horse looks

Why its never Rainbow says I Its twelve years and over since I
saw him last

I didnt care if it was twenty said she Here he is and goes as
sound as a bell His poor old teeth are getting done but he aint the
only one that way is he Joe Hell never die if I can keep him alive
I have to give him cornmeal though so as he can grind it easy

I believe she thinks more of that old moke than me and the children all
put together says Joe Moreton

And why shouldnt I says Maddie facing round at him just the old
way Isnt he the finest horse that ever stood on legs and didnt he
belong to the finest gentleman that you or any one else looked at Dont
say a word against him for I cant stand it I believe if you was to
lay a whip across that old horse in anger Id go away and leave you
Joe Moreton just as if you was a regular black stranger Poor Rainbow
Isnt he a darling Here she stroked the old horses neck He was
rolling fat and had a coat like satin His legs were just as clean as
ever and he stood there as if he heard everything moving his old head
up and down the way he always didnever still a moment It brought
back old times and I felt soft enough I tell you Maddies lips were
trembling again too and her eyes like two coals of fire As for Joe
he said nothing more and the best thing too The boy led Rainbow over
to the fence and old George walked us all into the church and that
settled things

After the words were said we all went back to Georges together and
Maddie and her husband drank a glass of wine to our health and wished
us luck They rode as far as the turn off to Rocky Flat with us and
then took the Turon road

Goodbye Dick says Maddie bending down over the old horses neck
Youve got a stunning good wife now if ever any man had in the whole
world Mind youre an A1 husband or well all round on you and your
life wont be worth having and Ive got the best horse in the country
havent I See where the bullet went through his poor neck Theres no
lady in the land got one thats a patch on him Steady now Rainbow
well be off in a minute You shall see my little Jim there take him
over a hurdle yard He can ride a bit as young as he is Pity poor old
Jim aint here today isnt it Dick Think of him being cold in his
grave now and we here Well its no use crying is it

And off went Maddie at a pace that gave Joe and the boy all they knew to
catch her

     

Were to live here for a month or two till I get used to outdoor work
and the regular old bush life again Theres no life like it to my
fancy Then we start bag and baggage for one of Georges Queensland
stations right away up on the Barcoo that Im to manage and have a
share in

It freshens me up to think of making a start in a new country Its a
long way from where we were born and brought up but all the better for
that Of course theyll know about me but in any part of Australia
once a chap shows that hes given up cross doings and means to go
straight for the future the people of the country will always lend him
a helping hand particularly if hes married to such a wife as Gracey
Im not afraid of any of my troubles in the old days being cast up to
me and men are so scarce and hard to get west of the Barcoo that no one
that once had Dick Marstons help at a muster is likely to remind him of
such an old story as that of Robbery Under Arms




 THE END






 Notes on the text



 General


 The original serial of this story had roughly 29000 more words than
 the version given here but it should be noted that this version is the
 standard text that has been widely available since then

 The combination of this story being a serial with cuts from the
 original which may not have been perfectly executed has led to a few
 discrepancies Thus in Chapter 2 it is mentioned that Patsey Daly
 was hanged but in Chapter 44 the same character is shot to death In
 Chapter 42 Starlight as Mr Lascelles dances with Maddie Barnes one
 night and the next day in the same disguise she does not recognise
 him And then there are some gaps In Chapter 24 the story line
 suddenly jumps from a scene where the characters are riding to the
 Hollow to a discussion about selling horses In Chapter 31 Dick
 Marston says I did live to do her Maddie Barnes a good turn back
 but there seems to be nothing later in the story worth mentioning in
 this line In Chapter 35 a reference is made to old Mr Devereuxs
 box which was apparently discovered in Chapter 22 or 23 but cut out
 from this edition

 The story is still quite readable and enjoyable despite these things
 but they are mentioned so that the interested reader may look further
 if they desire into obtaining an edition which includes the complete
 text in the original Newspaper serial and to give a general idea what
 sort of things might have been cut


 Captain Starlight was the name used by a real bushranger Frank
 Pearson 183799 but Boldrewood claimed that his Starlight was a
 composite based in part on Captain Midnight and Harry Redford ca
 1842 to 1901 the latter of which stole a herd of cattle in a
 similar manner to that described in the book The factual events
 that contributed to the story took place in the late 1860s and
 other periods but Boldrewood set his story in the 1850s The name
 Starlight is also used in Adam Lindsay Gordons famous poem The Sick
 Stockrider

 Warrigal the name of the halfcaste character is also an Australian
 term for the Dingo or native dog


 A couple other famous highwaymen are alluded to in the story

 Dick Turpin who is mentioned twice was an English
 highwayman 170639 There is apparently a legendary ride
 from London to York that is popularly attributed to him the
 idea being that he established an alibi by covering the
 distance so swiftly after a robbery

 Claude Duval was famous for being gallant to women Born in
 France he came to England with the Duke of Richmond about
 1660 the Restoration and turned out shortly afterwards


 Terms
 

 There are a number of Australian terms in the text which may not be
 listed in nonAustralian dictionarieseven unabridged ones Here are a
 few


 bail up To stick up According to Boldrewood from the term used with
 cows where bail up means to secure a cows head in a bail a type of
 frame before milking

 bunyip pronounced bunyup A large mythological creature said by the
 Aborigines to inhabit watery places There may be some relation to an
 actual creature that is now extinct

 dinkum Now means honest or genuine but used by Boldrewood in its
 obsolete sense work or an amount of work In fact one major
 Australian dictionary quotes this very book for an example of this
 obsolete sense

 forester The eastern gray kangaroo

 gin An Aboriginal womanfrom an aboriginal word for woman or wife
 Considered derogatory in current usage

 jerran Afraid From an aboriginal language Now obsolete

 mallee scrubber Mallee a variety of Eucalyptus or a remote wild
 area like bush Scrubber a farm animal that has gone wild hence

 fattened first Hence they are in store for future use or for use as
 stock

 skillion A leanto or outbuilding

 POPULAR NOVELS BY THE SAME AUTHOR


 THE MINERS RIGHT A Tale of the Australian GoldFields

 AthenaeumThe picture is unquestionably interesting thanks to the
 very detail and fidelity which tend to qualify its attractiveness for
 those who like excitement and incident before anything else

 WorldFull of good passages passages abounding in vivacity in the
 colour and play of life The pith of the book lies in its singularly
 fresh and vivid pictures of the humours of the goldfieldstragic
 humours enough they are too here and again

 Manchester ExaminerThe characters are sketched with real life and
 picturesqueness Mr Boldrewood accomplishes the very difficult feat of
 enabling his readers not only to understand the bewildering complexities
 of mining law but to be interested in the situations which arise out of
 their operation while his fund of incident seems to be large enough
 to meet all the demands made upon it Indeed the book is lively and
 readable from first to last


 THE SQUATTERS DREAM

 Saturday ReviewIt is not often that stories of colonial life are
 so interesting as Mr Boldrewoods Squatters Dream There is enough
 story in the book to give connected interest to the various incidents
 and these are all told with considerable spirit and at times
 picturesqueness

 FieldThe details are filled in by a hand evidently well conversant
 with his subject and everything is ben trovato if not actually true
 A perusal of these cheerfullywritten pages will probably give a better
 idea of realities of Australian life than could be obtained from many
 more pretentious works


 A SYDNEYSIDE SAXON

 Glasgow HeraldThe interest never flags and altogether A SydneySide
 Saxon is a really refreshing book

 AntiJacobinThoroughly well worth reading A clever book
 admirably written Brisk in incident truthful and lifelike in
 character Beyond and above all it has that stimulating hygienic
 quality that cheerful unconscious healthfulness which makes a story
 like Robinson Crusoe or The Vicar of Wakefield so unspeakably
 refreshing after a course of even good contemporary fiction


 A COLONIAL REFORMER

 AthenaeumA series of natural and entertaining pictures of Australian
 life which are above all things readable

 Glasgow HeraldOne of the most interesting books about Australia we
 have ever read

 Saturday ReviewMr Boldrewood can tell what he knows with great point
 and vigour and there is no better reading than the adventurous parts of
 his books
