ACT I

Roadside with big stones etc on the right low loose wall at back
with gap near centre at left ruined doorway of church with bushes
beside it Martin Doul and Mary Doul grope in on left and pass over to
stones on right where they sit

MARY DOUL What place are we now Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL Passing the gap

MARY DOUL  raising her head  The length of that Well the suns
getting warm this day if its late autumn itself

MARTIN DOUL  putting out his hands in sun  What way wouldnt
it be warm and it getting high up in the south You were that length
plaiting your yellow hair you have the morning lost on us and the
people are after passing to the fair of Clash

MARY DOUL It isnt going to the fair the time they do be driving their
cattle and they with a litter of pigs maybe squealing in their carts
theyd give us a thing at all She sits down Its well you know that
but you must be talking

MARTIN DOUL  sitting down beside her and beginning to shred rushes
she gives him  If I didnt talk Id be destroyed in a short while
listening to the clack you do be making for youve a queer cracked
voice the Lord have mercy on you if its fine to look on you are
itself

MARY DOUL Who wouldnt have a cracked voice sitting out all the year
in the rain falling Its a bad life for the voice Martin Doul though
Ive heard tell there isnt anything like the wet south wind does be
blowing upon us for keeping a white beautiful skin  the like of my
skin  on your neck and on your brows and there isnt anything at all
like a fine skin for putting splendour on a woman

MARTIN DOUL  teasingly but with good humour  I do be thinking
odd times we dont know rightly what way you have your splendour or
asking myself maybe if you have it at all for the time I was a young
lad and had fine sight it was the ones with sweet voices were the best
in face

MARY DOUL Let you not be making the like of that talk when youve heard
Timmy the smith and Mat Simon and Patch Ruadh and a power besides
saying fine things of my face and you know rightly it was the
beautiful dark woman they did call me in Ballinatone

MARTIN DOUL  as before  If it was itself I heard Molly Byrne
saying at the fall of night it was little more than a fright you were

MARY DOUL  sharply  She was jealous God forgive her because
Timmy the smith was after praising my hair

MARTIN DOUL  with mock irony  Jealous

MARY DOUL Ay jealous Martin Doul and if she wasnt itself the young
and silly do be always making game of them thats dark and theyd think
it a fine thing if they had us deceived the way we wouldnt know we
were so finelooking at all

She puts her hand to her face with a complacent gesture

MARTIN DOUL  a little plaintively  I do be thinking in the long
nights itd be a grand thing if we could see ourselves for one hour or
a minute itself the way wed know surely we were the finest man and the
finest woman of the seven counties of the east bitterly and then the
seeing rabble below might be destroying their souls telling bad lies
and wed never heed a thing theyd say

MARY DOUL If you werent a big fool you wouldnt heed them this hour
Martin Doul for theyre a bad lot those that have their sight and they
do have great joy the time they do be seeing a grand thing to let on
they dont see it at all and to be telling fools lies the like of
what Molly Byrne was telling to yourself

MARTIN DOUL If its lies she does be telling shes a sweet beautiful
voice youd never tire to be hearing if it was only the pig shed
be calling or crying out in the long grass maybe after her hens
Speaking pensively It should be a fine soft rounded woman Im
thinking would have a voice the like of that

MARY DOUL  sharply again scandalized  Let you not be minding if
its flat or rounded she is for shes a flighty foolish woman youll
hear when youre off a long way and she making a great noise and
laughing at the well

MARTIN DOUL Isnt laughing a nice thing the time a womans young

MARY DOUL  bitterly  A nice thing is it A nice thing to hear a
woman making a loud braying laugh the like of that Ah shes a great
one for drawing the men and youll hear Timmy himself the time he does
be sitting in his forge getting mighty fussy if shell come walking
from Grianan the way youll hear his breath going and he wringing his
hands

MARTIN DOUL  slightly piqued  Ive heard him say a power of times
its nothing at all she is when you see her at the side of you and yet
I never heard any mans breath getting uneasy the time hed be looking
on yourself

MARY DOUL Im not the like of the girls do be running round on the
roads swinging their legs and they with their necks out looking on the
men Ah theres a power of villainy walking the world Martin Doul
among them that do be gadding around with their gaping eyes and their
sweet words and they with no sense in them at all

MARTIN DOUL  sadly  Its the truth maybe and yet Im told its
a grand thing to see a young girl walking the road

MARY DOUL Youd be as bad as the rest of them if you had your sight
and I did well surely not to marry a seeing man its scores would have
had me and welcome  for the seeing is a queer lot and youd never
know the thing theyd do A moments pause

MARTIN DOUL  listening  Theres some one coming on the road

MARY DOUL Let you put the pith away out of their sight or theyll be
picking it out with the spying eyes they have and saying its rich we
are and not sparing us a thing at all

They bundle away the rushes Timmy the smith comes in on left

MARTIN DOUL  with a begging voice  Leave a bit of silver for
blind Martin your honour Leave a bit of silver or a penny copper
itself and well be praying the Lord to bless you and you going the
way

TIMMY  stopping before them  And you letting on a while back you
knew my step He sits down

MARTIN  with his natural voice  I know it when Molly Byrnes
walking in front or when shes two perches maybe lagging behind but
its few times Ive heard you walking up the like of that as if youd
met a thing wasnt right and you coming on the road

TIMMY  hot and breathless wiping his face  Youve good ears God
bless you if youre a liar itself for Im after walking up in great
haste from hearing wonders in the fair

MARTIN DOUL  rather contemptuously  Youre always hearing queer
wonderful things and the lot of them nothing at all but Im thinking
this time its a strange thing surely youd be walking up before the
turn of day and not waiting below to look on them lepping or dancing
or playing shows on the green of Clash

TIMMY  huffed  I was coming to tell you its in this place
thered be a bigger wonder done in a short while Martin Doul stops
working than was ever done on the green of Clash or the width of
Leinster itself but youre thinking maybe youre too cute a little
fellow to be minding me at all

MARTIN DOUL  amused but incredulous  Therell be wonders in this
place is it

TIMMY Here at the crossing of the roads

MARTIN DOUL I never heard tell of anything to happen in this place
since the night they killed the old fellow going home with his gold the
Lord have mercy on him and threw down his corpse into the bog Let
them not be doing the like of that this night for its ourselves have
a right to the crossing roads and we dont want any of your bad tricks
or your wonders either for its wonder enough we are ourselves

TIMMY If Id a mind Id be telling you of a real wonder this day and
the way youll be having a great joy maybe youre not thinking on at
all

MARTIN DOUL  interested  Are they putting up a still behind in
the rocks Itd be a grand thing if Id sup handy the way I wouldnt be
destroying myself groping up across the bogs in the rain falling

TIMMY  still moodily  Its not a still theyre bringing or the
like of it either

MARY DOUL  persuasively to Timmy  Maybe theyre hanging a thief
above at the bit of a tree Im told its a great sight to see a man
hanging by his neck but what joy would that be to ourselves and we not
seeing it at all

TIMMY  more pleasantly  Theyre hanging no one this day Mary
Doul and yet with the help of God youll see a power hanged before
you die

MARY DOUL Well youve queer humbugging talk What way would I see a
power hanged and I a dark woman since the seventh year of my age

TIMMY Did ever you hear tell of a place across a bit of the sea where
there is an island and the grave of the four beautiful saints

MARY DOUL Ive heard people have walked round from the west and they
speaking of that

TIMMY  impressively  Theres a green ferny well Im told behind
of that place and if you put a drop of the water out of it on the eyes
of a blind man youll make him see as well as any person is walking the
world

MARTIN DOUL  with excitement  Is that the truth Timmy Im
thinking youre telling a lie

TIMMY  gruffly  Thats the truth Martin Doul and you may
believe it now for youre after believing a power of things werent as
likely at all

MARY DOUL Maybe we could send us a young lad to bring us the water I
could wash a naggin bottle in the morning and Im thinking Patch Ruadh
would go for it if we gave him a good drink and the bit of money we
have hid in the thatch

TIMMY Itd be no good to be sending a sinful man the like of ourselves
for Im told the holiness of the water does be getting soiled with the
villainy of your heart the time youd be carrying it and you looking
round on the girls maybe or drinking a small sup at a still

MARTIN DOUL  with disappointment  Itd be a long terrible way to
be walking ourselves and Im thinking thats a wonder will bring small
joy to us at all

TIMMY  turning on him impatiently  What is it you want with
your walking Its as deaf as blind youre growing if youre not after
hearing me say its in this place the wonder would be done

MARTIN DOUL  with a flash of anger  If it is cant you open the
big slobbering mouth you have and say what way itll be done and not be
making blather till the fall of night

TIMMY  jumping up  Ill be going on now Mary Doul rises and
not wasting time talking civil talk with the like of you

MARY DOUL  standing up disguising her impatience  Let you come
here to me Timmy and not be minding him at all Timmy stops and
she gropes up to him and takes him by the coat Youre not huffy with
myself and let you tell me the whole story and dont be fooling me
more Is it yourself has brought us the water

TIMMY It is not surely

MARY DOUL Then tell us your wonder Timmy What personll bring it
at all

TIMMY  relenting  Its a fine holy man will bring it a saint of
the Almighty God

MARY DOUL  overawed  A saint is it

TIMMY Ay a fine saint whos going round through the churches of
Ireland with a long cloak on him and naked feet for hes brought
a sup of the water slung at his side and with the like of him any
little drop is enough to cure the dying or to make the blind see as
clear as the gray hawks do be high up on a still day sailing the sky

MARTIN DOUL  feeling for his stick  What place is he Timmy Ill
be walking to him now

TIMMY Let you stay quiet Martin Hes straying around saying prayers
at the churches and high crosses between this place and the hills and
he with a great crowd go ing behind  for its fine prayers he does
be saying and fasting with it till hes as thin as one of the empty
rushes you have there on your knee then hell be coming after to this
place to cure the two of you  were after telling him the way you are
 and to say his prayers in the church

MARTIN DOUL  turning suddenly to Mary Doul  And well be seeing
ourselves this day Oh glory be to God is it true surely

MARY DOUL  very pleased to Timmy  Maybe Id have time to walk
down and get the big shawl I have below for I do look my best Ive
heard them say when Im dressed up with that thing on my head

TIMMY Youd have time surely

MARTIN DOUL  listening Whisht now I hear people again coming by
the stream

TIMMY  looking out left puzzled  Its the young girls I left
walking after the Saint Theyre coming now goes up to entrance
carrying things in their hands and they walking as easy as youd see a
child walk whod have a dozen eggs hid in her bib

MARTIN DOUL  listening  Thats Molly Byrne Im thinking

Molly Byrne and Bride come on left and cross to Martin Doul carrying
watercan Saints bell and cloak

MOLLY  volubly  God bless you Martin Ive holy water here from
the grave of the four saints of the west will have you cured in a short
while and seeing like ourselves

TIMMY  crosses to Molly interrupting her  Hes heard that
God help you But where at all is the Saint and what way is he after
trusting the holy water with the likes of you

MOLLY BYRNE He was afeard to go a far way with the clouds is coming
beyond so hes gone up now through the thick woods to say a prayer at
the crosses of Grianan and hes coming on this road to the church

TIMMY  still astonished  And hes after leaving the holy water
with the two of you Its a wonder surely Comes down left a little

MOLLY BYRNE The lads told him no person could carry them things through
the briars and steep slippyfeeling rocks hell be climbing above
so he looked round then and gave the water and his big cloak and his
bell to the two of us for young girls says he are the cleanest holy
people youd see walking the world Mary Doul goes near seat

MARY DOUL  sits down laughing to herself  Well the Saints a
simple fellow and its no lie

MARTIN DOUL  leaning forward holding out his hands  Let you
give me the water in my hand Molly Byrne the way Ill know you have it
surely

MOLLY BYRNE  giving it to him  Wonders is queer things and maybe
itd cure you and you holding it alone

MARTIN DOUL  looking round  It does not Molly Im not seeing
at all He shakes the can Theres a small sup only Well isnt it a
great wonder the little trifling thing would bring seeing to the blind
and be showing us the big women and the young girls and all the fine
things is walking the world

He feels for Mary Doul and gives her the can

MARY DOUL  shaking it  Well glory be to God

MARTIN DOUL  pointing to Bride  And what is it herself has
making sounds in her hand

BRIDE  crossing to Martin Doul  Its the Saints bell youll
hear him ringing out the time hell be going up some place to be saying
his prayers


Martin Doul holds out his hand she gives it to him

MARTIN DOUL  ringing it  Its a sweet beautiful sound

MARY DOUL Youd know Im thinking by the little silvery voice of it
a fasting holy man was after carrying it a great way at his side

Bride crosses a little right behind Martin Doul

MOLLY BYRNE  unfolding Saints cloak  Let you stand up now
Martin Doul till I put his big cloak on you Martin Doul rises comes
forward centre a little The way wed see how youd look and you a
saint of the Almighty God

MARTIN DOUL  standing up a little diffidently  Ive heard the
priests a power of times making great talk and praises of the beauty of
the saints Molly Byrne slips cloak round him

TIMMY  uneasily  Youd have a right to be leaving him alone
Molly What would the Saint say if he seen you making game with his
cloak

MOLLY BYRNE  recklessly  How would he see us and he saying
prayers in the wood She turns Martin Doul round Isnt that a fine
holylooking saint Timmy the smith Laughing foolishly Theres a
grand handsome fellow Mary Doul and if you seen him now youd be as
proud Im thinking as the archangels below fell out with the Almighty
God

MARY DOUL  with quiet confidence going to Martin Doul and feeling his
cloak  Its proud well be this day surely Martin Doul is still
ringing

MOLLY BYRNE  to Martin Doul  Would you think well to be all your
life walking round the like of that Martin Doul and you bellringing
with the saints of God

MARY DOUL  turning on her fiercely  How would he be bellringing
with the saints of God and he wedded with myself

MARTIN DOUL Its the truth shes saying and if bellringing is a
fine life yet Im thinking maybe its better I am wedded with the
beautiful dark woman of Ballinatone

MOLLY BYRNE  scornfully  Youre thinking that God help you but
its little you know of her at all

MARTIN DOUL Its little surely and Im destroyed this day waiting to
look upon her face

TIMMY  awkwardly  Its well you know the way she is for the like
of you do have great knowledge in the feeling of your hands

MARTIN DOUL  still feeling the cloak  We do maybe Yet its
little I know of faces or of fine beautiful cloaks for its few cloaks
Ive had my hand to and few faces plaintively for the young girls is
mighty shy Timmy the smith and it isnt much they heed me though they
do be saying Im a handsome man

MARY DOUL  mockingly with good humour  Isnt it a queer
thing the voice he puts on him when you hear him talking of the
skinnylooking girls and he married with a woman hes heard called the
wonder of the western world

TIMMY  pityingly  The two of you will see a great wonder this
day and its no lie

MARTIN DOUL Ive heard tell her yellow hair and her white skin and
her big eyes are a wonder surely

BRIDE  who has looked out left  Heres the saint coming from the
selvage of the wood Strip the cloak from him Molly or hell be
seeing it now

MOLLY BYRNE  hastily to Bride  Take the bell and put yourself by
the stones To Martin Doul Will you hold your head up till I loosen
the cloak She pulls off the cloak and throws it over her arm Then she
pushes Martin Doul over and stands him beside Mary Doul Stand there
now quiet and let you not be saying a word

She and Bride stand a little on their left demurely with bell etc
in their hands

MARTIN DOUL  nervously arranging his clothes  Will he mind the
way we are and not tidied or washed cleanly at all

MOLLY BYRNE Hell not see what way you are Hed walk by the finest
woman in Ireland Im thinking and not trouble to raise his two eyes to
look upon her face Whisht

The Saint comes left with crowd

SAINT Are these the two poor people

TIMMY  officiously  They are holy father they do be always
sitting here at the crossing of the roads asking a bit of copper from
them that do pass or stripping rushes for lights and they not mournful
at all but talking out straight with a full voice and making game with
them that likes it

SAINT  to Martin Doul and Mary Doul  Its a hard life youve had
not seeing sun or moon or the holy priests itself praying to the Lord
but its the like of you who are brave in a bad time will make a fine
use of the gift of sight the Almighty God will bring to you today He
takes his cloak and puts it about him Its on a bare starving rock
that theres the grave of the four beauties of God the way its little
wonder Im thinking if its with bare starving people the water
should be used He takes the water and bell and slings them round his
shoulders So its to the like of yourselves I do be going who are
wrinkled and poor a thing rich men would hardly look at at all but
would throw a coin to or a crust of bread

MARTIN DOUL  moving uneasily  When they look on herself who is a
fine woman

TIMMY  shaking him  Whisht now and be listening to the Saint

SAINT  looks at them a moment continues  If its raggy and dirty
you are itself Im saying the Almighty God isnt at all like the rich
men of Ireland and with the power of the water Im after bringing in
a little curagh into Cashla Bay Hell have pity on you and put sight
into your eyes

MARTIN DOUL  taking off his hat  Im ready now holy father

SAINT  taking him by the hand  Ill cure you first and then Ill
come for your wife Well go up now into the church for I must say
a prayer to the Lord To Mary Doul as he moves off And let you be
making your mind still and saying praises in your heart for its a
great wonderful thing when the power of the Lord of the world is brought
down upon your like

PEOPLE  pressing after him  Come now till we watch

BRIDE Come Timmy

SAINT  waving them back  Stay back where you are for Im not
wanting a big crowd making whispers in the church Stay back there
Im saying and youd do well to be thinking on the way sin has brought
blindness to the world and to be saying a prayer for your own sakes
against false prophets and heathens and the words of women and smiths
and all knowledge that would soil the soul or the body of a man

People shrink back He goes into church Mary Doul gropes halfway
towards the door and kneels near path People form a group at right

TIMMY Isnt it a fine beautiful voice he has and he a fine brave man
if it wasnt for the fasting

BRIDE Did you watch him moving his hands

MOLLY BYRNE Itd be a fine thing if some one in this place could pray
the like of him for Im thinking the water from our own blessed well
would do rightly if a man knew the way to be saying prayers and then
thered be no call to be bringing water from that wild place where Im
told there are no decent houses or finelooking people at all

BRIDE  who is looking in at door from right  Look at the great
trembling Martin has shaking him and he on his knees

TIMMY  anxiously  God help him What will he be doing when he
sees his wife this day Im thinking it was bad work we did when we let
on she was finelooking and not a wrinkled wizened hag the way she is

MAT SIMON Why would he be vexed and we after giving him great joy and
pride the time he was dark

MOLLY BYRNE  sitting down in Mary Douls seat and tidying her hair
 If its vexed he is itself hell have other things now to think on
as well as his wife and what does any man care for a wife when its
two weeks or three he is looking on her face

MAT SIMON Thats the truth now Molly and its more joy dark Martin
got from the lies we told of that hag is kneeling by the path than your
own man will get from you day or night and he living at your side

MOLLY BYRNE  defiantly  Let you not be talking Mat Simon for
its not yourself will be my man though youd be crowing and singing
fine songs if youd that hope in you at all

TIMMY  shocked to Molly Byrne  Let you not be raising your voice
when the Saints above at his prayers

BRIDE  crying out  Whisht Whisht Im thinking hes cured

MARTIN DOUL  crying out in the church  Oh glory be to God

SAINT  solemnly Laus Patri sit et Filio cum Spiritu Paraclito Qui
Suae dono gratiae misertus est Hiberniae

MARTIN DOUL  ecstatically  Oh glory be to God I see now
surely I see the walls of the church and the green bits of ferns in
them and yourself holy father and the great width of the sky

He runs out halffoolish with joy and comes past Mary Doul as she
scrambles to her feet drawing a little away from her as he goes by

TIMMY  to the others  He doesnt know her at all

The Saint comes out behind Martin Doul and leads Mary Doul into the
church Martin Doul comes on to the People The men are between him and
the Girls he verifies his position with his stick

MARTIN DOUL  crying out joyfully  Thats Timmy I know Timmy by
the black of his head Thats Mat Simon I know Mat by the length of
his legs That should be Patch Ruadh with the gamey eyes in him and
the fiery hair He sees Molly Byrne on Mary Douls seat and his voice
changes completely Oh it was no lie they told me Mary Doul Oh
glory to God and the seven saints I didnt die and not see you at all
The blessing of God on the water and the feet carried it round through
the land The blessing of God on this day and them that brought me
the Saint for its grand hair you have she lowers her head a little
confused and soft skin and eyes would make the saints if they were
dark awhile and seeing again fall down out of the sky He goes nearer
to her Hold up your head Mary the way Ill see its richer I am than
the great kings of the east Hold up your head Im saying for its
soon youll be seeing me and I not a bad one at all He touches her
and she starts up

MOLLY BYRNE Let you keep away from me and not be soiling my chin
People laugh heartily

MARTIN DOUL  bewildered  Its Mollys voice you have

MOLLY BYRNE Why wouldnt I have my own voice Do you think Im a ghost

MARTIN DOUL Which of you all is herself He goes up to Bride Is it
you is Mary Doul Im thinking youre more the like of what they said
peering at her For youve yellow hair and white skin and its the
smell of my own turf is rising from your shawl He catches her shawl

BRIDE  pulling away her shawl  Im not your wife and let you get
out of my way The People laugh again

MARTIN DOUL  with misgiving to another Girl  Is it yourself
it is Youre not so finelooking but Im thinking youd do with the
grand nose you have and your nice hands and your feet

GIRL  scornfully  I never seen any person that took me for blind
and a seeing woman Im thinking would never wed the like of you

She turns away and the People laugh once more drawing back a little
and leaving him on their left

PEOPLE  jeeringly  Try again Martin try again and youll be
finding her yet

MARTIN DOUL  passionately  Where is it you have her hidden away
Isnt it a black shame for a drove of pitiful beasts the like of you to
be making game of me and putting a fools head on me the grand day
of my life Ah youre thinking youre a fine lot with your giggling
weeping eyes a fine lot to be making game of myself and the woman Ive
heard called the great wonder of the west

During this speech which he gives with his back towards the church
Mary Doul has come out with her sight cured and come down towards the
right with a silly simpering smile till she is a little behind Martin
Doul

MARY DOUL  when he pauses  Which of you is Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL  wheeling round  Its her voice surely They stare
at each other blankly

MOLLY BYRNE  to Martin Doul  Go up now and take her under the
chin and be speaking the way you spoke to myself

MARTIN DOUL  in a low voice with intensity  If I speak now Ill
speak hard to the two of you

MOLLY BYRNE  to Mary Doul  Youre not saying a word Mary What
is it you think of himself with the fat legs on him and the little
neck like a ram

MARY DOUL Im thinking its a poor thing when the Lord God gives you
sight and puts the like of that man in your way

MARTIN DOUL Its on your two knees you should be thanking the Lord God
youre not looking on yourself for if it was yourself you seen youd
be running round in a short while like the old screeching madwoman is
running round in the glen

MARY DOUL  beginning to realize herself  If Im not so fine as
some of them said I have my hair and big eyes and my white skin

MARTIN DOUL  breaking out into a passionate cry  Your hair and
your big eyes is it Im telling you there isnt a wisp on any gray
mare on the ridge of the world isnt finer than the dirty twist on your
head There isnt two eyes in any starving sow isnt finer than the eyes
you were calling blue like the sea

MARY DOUL  interrupting him  Its the devil cured you this
day with your talking of sows its the devil cured you this day Im
saying and drove you crazy with lies

MARTIN DOUL Isnt it yourself is after playing lies on me ten years
in the day and in the night but what is that to you now the Lord God
has given eyes to me the way I see you an old wizendy hag was never
fit to rear a child to me itself

MARY DOUL I wouldnt rear a crumpled whelp the like of you Its many
a woman is married with finer than yourself should be praising God if
shes no child and isnt loading the earth with things would make the
heavens lonesome above and they scaring the larks and the crows and
the angels passing in the sky

MARTIN DOUL Go on now to be seeking a lonesome place where the earth
can hide you away go on now Im saying or youll be having men and
women with their knees bled and they screaming to God for a holy water
would darken their sight for theres no man but would liefer be blind a
hundred years or a thousand itself than to be looking on your like

MARY DOUL  raising her stick  Maybe if I hit you a strong blow
youd be blind again and having what you want

The Saint is seen in the church door with his head bent in prayer

MARTIN DOUL  raising his stick and driving Mary Doul back towards
left  Let you keep off from me now if you wouldnt have me strike
out the little handful of brains you have about on the road

He is going to strike her but Timmy catches him by the arm

TIMMY Have you no shame to be making a great row and the Saint above
saying his prayers

MARTIN DOUL What is it I care for the like of him Struggling to free
himself Let me hit her one good one for the love of the Almighty God
and Ill be quiet after till I die

TIMMY  shaking him  Will you whisht Im saying

SAINT  coming forward centre  Are their minds troubled with joy
or is their sight uncertain the way it does often be the day a person
is restored

TIMMY Its too certain their sight is holy father and theyre after
making a great fight because theyre a pair of pitiful shows

SAINT  coming between them  May the Lord who has given you sight
send a little sense into your heads the way it wont be on your two
selves youll be looking  on two pitiful sinners of the earth  but
on the splendour of the Spirit of God youll see an odd time shining
out through the big hills and steep streams falling to the sea For if
its on the like of that you do be thinking youll not be minding
the faces of men but youll be saying prayers and great praises till
youll be living the way the great saints do be living with little but
old sacks and skin covering their bones To Timmy Leave him go now
youre seeing hes quiet again He frees Martin Doul And let you he
turns to Mary Doul not be raising your voice a bad thing in a woman
but let the lot of you who have seen the power of the Lord be thinking
on it in the dark night and be saying to yourselves its great pity and
love He has for the poor starving people of Ireland He gathers his
cloak about him And now the Lord send blessing to you all for I am
going on to Annagolan where there is a deaf woman and to Laragh
where there are two men without sense and to Glenassil where there are
children blind from their birth and then Im going to sleep this night
in the bed of the holy Kevin and to be prais ing God and asking great
blessing on you all He bends his head

CURTAIN




ACT II

Village roadside on left the door of a forge with broken wheels
etc lying about A well near centre with board above it and room to
pass behind it Martin Doul is sitting near forge cutting sticks

TIMMY  heard hammering inside forge then calls  Let you make
haste out there Ill be putting up new fires at the turn of day and
you havent the half of them cut yet

MARTIN DOUL  gloomily  Its destroyed Ill be whacking your old
thorns till the turn of day and I with no food in my stomach would keep
the life in a pig He turns towards the door Let you come out here
and cut them yourself if you want them cut for theres an hour every
day when a man has a right to his rest

TIMMY  coming out with a hammer impatiently  Do you want me to
be driving you off again to be walking the roads There you are now and
I giving you your food and a corner to sleep and money with it
and to hear the talk of you youd think I was after beating you or
stealing your gold

MARTIN DOUL Youd do it handy maybe if Id gold to steal

TIMMY  throws down hammer picks up some of the sticks already cut
and throws them into door Theres no fear of your having gold  a
lazy basking fool the like of you

MARTIN DOUL No fear maybe and I here with yourself for its more I
got a while since and I sitting blinded in Grianan than I get in this
place working hard and destroying myself the length of the day

TIMMY  stopping with amazement  Working hard He goes over to
him Ill teach you to work hard Martin Doul Strip off your coat now
and put a tuck in your sleeves and cut the lot of them while Id
rake the ashes from the forge or Ill not put up with you another hour
itself

MARTIN DOUL  horrified  Would you have me getting my death
sitting out in the black wintry air with no coat on me at all

TIMMY  with authority  Strip it off now or walk down upon the
road

MARTIN DOUL  bitterly  Oh God help me He begins taking off
his coat Ive heard tell you stripped the sheet from your wife and you
putting her down into the grave and that there isnt the like of you
for plucking your living ducks the short days and leaving them running
round in their skins in the great rains and the cold He tucks up his
sleeves Ah Ive heard a power of queer things of yourself and there
isnt one of them Ill not believe from this day and be telling to the
boys

TIMMY  pulling over a big stick  Let you cut that now and give
me rest from your talk for Im not heeding you at all

MARTIN DOUL  taking stick  Thats a hard terrible stick Timmy
and isnt it a poor thing to be cutting strong timber the like of that
when its cold the bark is and slippy with the frost of the air

TIMMY  gathering up another armful of sticks  What way wouldnt
it be cold and it freezing since the moon was changed He goes into
forge

MARTIN DOUL  querulously as he cuts slowly  What way indeed
Timmy For its a raw beastly day we do have each day till I do
be thinking its well for the blind dont be seeing them gray clouds
driving on the hill and dont be looking on people with their noses
red the like of your nose and their eyes weeping and watering the
like of your eyes God help you Timmy the smith

TIMMY  seen blinking in doorway  Is it turning now you are
against your sight

MARTIN DOUL  very miserably  Its a hard thing for a man to have
his sight and he living near to the like of you he cuts a stick and
throws it away or wed with a wife cuts a stick and I do be thinking
it should be a hard thing for the Almighty God to be looking on the
world bad days and on men the like of yourself walking around on it
and they slipping each way in the muck

TIMMY  with pothooks which he taps on anvil  Youd have a right
to be minding Martin Doul for its a power the Saint cured lose their
sight after a while Mary Douls dimming again Ive heard them say
and Im thinking the Lord if he hears you making that talk will have
little pity left for you at all

MARTIN DOUL Theres not a bit of fear of me losing my sight and if
its a dark day itself its too well I see every wicked wrinkle you have
round by your eye

TIMMY  looking at him sharply  The days not dark since the
clouds broke in the east

MARTIN DOUL Let you not be tormenting yourself trying to make me
afeard You told me a power of bad lies the time I was blind and its
right now for you to stop and be taking your rest Mary Doul comes in
unnoticed on right with a sack filled with green stuff on her arm
for its little ease or quiet any person would get if the big fools of
Ireland werent weary at times He looks up and sees Mary Doul Oh
glory be to God shes coming again

He begins to work busily with his back to her

TIMMY  amused to Mary Doul as she is going by without looking at
them  Look on him now Mary Doul Youd be a great one for keeping
him steady at his work for hes after idling and blathering to this
hour from the dawn of day

MARY DOUL  stiffly  Of what is it youre speaking Timmy the
smith

TIMMY  laughing  Of himself surely Look on him there and he
with the shirt on him ripping from his back Youd have a right to come
round this night Im thinking and put a stitch into his clothes for
its long enough you are not speaking one to the other

MARY DOUL Let the two of you not torment me at all

She goes out left with her head in the air

MARTIN DOUL  stops work and looks after her  Well isnt it a
queer thing she cant keep herself two days without looking on my face

TIMMY  jeeringly  Looking on your face is it And she after going
by with her head turned the way youd see a priest going where thered
be a drunken man in the side ditch talking with a girl Martin Doul
gets up and goes to corner of forge and looks out left Come back here
and dont mind her at all Come back here Im saying youve no call
to be spying behind her since she went off and left you in place of
breaking her heart trying to keep you in the decency of clothes and
food

MARTIN DOUL  crying out indignantly  You know rightly Timmy it
was myself drove her away

TIMMY Thats a lie youre telling yet its little I care which one of
you was driving the other and let you walk back here Im saying to
your work

MARTIN DOUL  turning round  Im coming surely

He stops and looks out right going a step or two towards centre

TIMMY On what is it youre gaping Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL Theres a person walking above Its Molly Byrne Im
thinking coming down with her can

TIMMY If she is itself let you not be idling this day or minding her
at all and let you hurry with them sticks for Ill want you in a short
while to be blowing in the forge He throws down pothooks

MARTIN DOUL  crying out  Is it roasting me now youd be Turns
back and sees pothooks he takes them up Pothooks Is it over them
youve been inside sneezing and sweating since the dawn of day

TIMMY  resting himself on anvil with satisfaction  Im making
a power of things you do have when youre settling with a wife Martin
Doul for I heard tell last night the Saintll be passing again in a
short while and Id have him wed Molly with myself Hed do it Ive
heard them say for not a penny at all

MARTIN DOUL  lays down hooks and looks at him steadily  Mollyll
be saying great praises now to the Almighty God and He giving her a
fine stout hardy man the like of you

TIMMY  uneasily  And why wouldnt she if shes a fine woman
itself

MARTIN DOUL  looking up right  Why wouldnt she indeed
Timmy The Almighty Gods made a fine match in the two of you for
if you went marrying a woman was the like of yourself youd be having
the fearfullest little children Im thinking was ever seen in the
world

TIMMY  seriously offended  God forgive you if youre an ugly man
to be looking at Im thinking your tongues worse than your view

MARTIN DOUL  hurt also  Isnt it destroyed with the cold I
am and if Im ugly itself I never seen anyone the like of you for
dreepiness this day Timmy the smith and Im thinking now herselfs
coming above youd have a right to step up into your old shanty and
give a rub to your face and not be sitting there with your bleary eyes
and your big nose the like of an old scarecrow stuck down upon the
road

TIMMY  looking up the road uneasily Shes no call to mind what way
I look and I after building a house with four rooms in it above on the
hill He stands up But its a queer thing the way yourself and Mary
Doul are after setting every person in this place and up beyond to
Rathvanna talking of nothing and thinking of nothing but the way they
do be looking in the face Going towards forge Its the devils
work youre after doing with your talk of fine looks and Id do right
maybe to step in and wash the blackness from my eyes

He goes into forge Martin Doul rubs his face furtively with the tail
of his coat Molly Byrne comes on right with a watercan and begins to
fill it at the well

MARTIN DOUL God save you Molly Byrne

MOLLY BYRNE  indifferently  God save you

MARTIN DOUL Thats a dark gloomy day and the Lord have mercy on us
all

MOLLY BYRNE Middling dark

MARTIN DOUL Its a power of dirty days and dark mornings and
shabbylooking fellows he makes a gesture over his shoulder we do have
to be looking on when we have our sight God help us but theres one
fine thing we have to be looking on a grand white handsome girl the
like of you and every time I set my eyes on you I do be blessing the
saints and the holy water and the power of the Lord Almighty in the
heavens above

MOLLY BYRNE Ive heard the priests say it isnt looking on a young girl
would teach many to be saying their prayers Bailing water into her can
with a cup

MARTIN DOUL It isnt many have been the way I was hearing your voice
speaking and not seeing you at all

MOLLY BYRNE That should have been a queer time for an old wicked
coaxing fool to be sitting there with your eyes shut and not seeing a
sight of girl or woman passing the road

MARTIN DOUL If it was a queer time itself it was great joy and pride
I had the time Id hear your voice speaking and you passing to Grianan
beginning to speak with plaintive intensity for its of many a fine
thing your voice would put a poor dark fellow in mind and the day Id
hear it its of little else at all I would be thinking

MOLLY BYRNE Ill tell your wife if you talk to me the like of that
Youve heard maybe shes below picking nettles for the widow OFlinn
who took great pity on her when she seen the two of you fighting and
yourself putting shame on her at the crossing of the roads

MARTIN DOUL  impatiently  Is there no living person can speak a
score of words to me or say God speed you itself without putting me
in mind of the old woman or that day either at Grianan

MOLLY BYRNE  maliciously  I was thinking it should be a fine
thing to put you in mind of the day you called the grand day of your
life

MARTIN DOUL Grand day is it Plaintively again throwing aside his
work and leaning towards her Or a bad black day when I was roused up
and found I was the like of the little children do be listening to the
stories of an old woman and do be dreaming after in the dark night that
its in grand houses of gold they are with speckled horses to ride and
do be waking again in a short while and they destroyed with the cold
and the thatch dripping maybe and the starved ass braying in the yard

MOLLY BYRNE  working indifferently  Youve great romancing this
day Martin Doul Was it up at the still you were at the fall of night

MARTIN DOUL  stands up comes towards her but stands at far right
side of well  It was not Molly Byrne but lying down in a little
rickety shed Lying down across a sop of straw and I thinking I was
seeing you walk and hearing the sound of your step on a dry road and
hearing you again and you laughing and making great talk in a high room
with dry timber lining the roof For its a fine sound your voice has
that time and its better I am Im thinking lying down the way
a blind man does be lying than to be sitting here in the gray light
taking hard words of Timmy the smith

MOLLY BYRNE  looking at him with interest  Its queer talk you
have if its a little old shabby stump of a man you are itself

MARTIN DOUL Im not so old as you do hear them say

MOLLY BYRNE Youre old Im thinking to be talking that talk with a
girl

MARTIN DOUL  despondingly  Its not a lie youre telling maybe
for its long years Im after losing from the world feeling love and
talking love with the old woman and I fooled the whole while with the
lies of Timmy the smith

MOLLY BYRNE  half invitingly  Its a fine way youre wanting to
pay Timmy the smith And its not his LIES youre making love to this
day Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL It is not Molly and the Lord forgive us all He passes
behind her and comes near her left For Ive heard tell there are lands
beyond in Cahir Iveraghig and the Reeks of Cork with warm sun in them
and fine light in the sky Bending towards her And lights a grand
thing for a man ever was blind or a woman with a fine neck and a skin
on her the like of you the way wed have a right to go off this day
till wed have a fine life passing abroad through them towns of the
south and we telling stories maybe or singing songs at the fairs

MOLLY BYRNE  turning round half amused and looking him over from
head to foot  Well isnt it a queer thing when your own wifes
after leaving you because youre a pitiful show youd talk the like of
that to me

MARTIN DOUL  drawing back a little hurt but indignant  Its
a queer thing maybe for all things is queer in the world In a low
voice with peculiar emphasis But theres one thing Im telling you
if she walked off away from me it wasnt because of seeing me and I no
more than I am but because I was looking on her with my two eyes and
she getting up and eating her food and combing her hair and lying
down for her sleep

MOLLY BYRNE  interested off her guard  Wouldnt any married man
youd have be doing the like of that

MARTIN DOUL  seizing the moment that he has her attention  Im
thinking by the mercy of God its few sees anything but them is blind
for a space with excitement Its a few sees the old woman rotting for
the grave and its few sees the like of yourself He bends over her
Though its shining you are like a high lamp would drag in the ships
out of the sea

MOLLY BYRNE  shrinking away from him  Keep off from me Martin
Doul

MARTIN DOUL  quickly with low furious intensity  Its the truth
Im telling you He puts his hand on her shoulder and shakes her And
youd do right not to marry a man is after looking out a long while on
the bad days of the world for what way would the like of him have fit
eyes to look on yourself when you rise up in the morning and come out
of the little door you have above in the lane the time itd be a fine
thing if a man would be seeing and losing his sight the way hed have
your two eyes facing him and he going the roads and shining above him
and he looking in the sky and springing up from the earth the time
hed lower his head in place of the muck that seeing men do meet all
roads spread on the world

MOLLY BYRNE  who has listened half mesmerized starting away 
Its the like of that talk youd hear from a man would be losing his
mind

MARTIN DOUL  going after her passing to her right  Itd be
little wonder if a man near the like of you would be losing his mind
Put down your can now and come along with myself for Im seeing you
this day seeing you maybe the way no man has seen you in the world
He takes her by the arm and tries to pull her away softly to the
right Let you come on now Im saying to the lands of Iveragh and the
Reeks of Cork where you wont set down the width of your two feet and
not be crushing fine flowers and making sweet smells in the air

MOLLY BYRNE  laying down the can trying to free herself  Leave
me go Martin Doul Leave me go Im saying

MARTIN DOUL Let you not be fooling Come along now the little path
through the trees

MOLLY BYRNE  crying out towards forge  Timmy the smith Timmy
comes out of forge and Martin Doul lets her go Molly Byrne excited
and breathless pointing to Martin Doul Did ever you hear that them
that loses their sight loses their senses along with it Timmy the
smith

TIMMY  suspicious but uncertain  Hes no sense surely and
hell be having himself driven off this day from where hes good
sleeping and feeding and wages for his work

MOLLY BYRNE  as before  Hes a bigger fool than that Timmy Look
on him now and tell me if that isnt a grand fellow to think hes only
to open his mouth to have a fine woman the like of me running along by
his heels

Martin Doul recoils towards centre with his hand to his eyes Mary
Doul is seen on left coming forward softly

TIMMY  with blank amazement  Oh the blind is wicked people and
its no lie But hell walk off this day and not be troubling us more

Turns back left and picks up Martin Douls coat and stick some things
fall out of coat pocket which he gathers up again

MARTIN DOUL  turns around sees Mary Doul whispers to Molly Byrne
with imploring agony  Let you not put shame on me Molly before
herself and the smith Let you not put shame on me and I after saying
fine words to you and dreaming dreams in the night He
hesitates and looks round the sky Is it a storm of thunder is coming
or the last end of the world He staggers towards Mary Doul tripping
slightly over tin can The heavens is closing Im thinking with
darkness and great trouble passing in the sky He reaches Mary Doul
and seizes her left arm with both his hands  with a frantic cry Is
it darkness of thunder is coming Mary Doul Do you see me clearly with
your eyes

MARY DOUL  snatches her arm away and hits him with empty sack across
the face  I see you a sight too clearly and let you keep off from
me now

MOLLY BYRNE  clapping her hands  Thats right Mary Thats the
way to treat the like of him is after standing there at my feet and
asking me to go off with him till Id grow an old wretched roadwoman
the like of yourself

MARY DOUL  defiantly  When the skin shrinks on your chin Molly
Byrne there wont be the like of you for a shrunk hag in the four
quarters of Ireland Its a fine pair youd be surely

Martin Doul is standing at back right centre with his back to the
audience

TIMMY  coming over to Mary Doul  Is it no shame you have to let
on shed ever be the like of you

MARY DOUL Its them thats fat and flabby do be wrinkled young and
that whitish yellowy hair she has does be soon turning the like of a
handful of thin grass youd see rotting where the wet lies at the
north of a sty Turning to go out on right Ah its a better thing to
have a simple seemly face the like of my face for twoscore years or
fifty itself than to be setting fools mad a short while and then to be
turning a thing would drive off the little children from your feet

She goes out Martin Doul has come forward again mastering himself
but uncertain

TIMMY Oh God protect us Molly from the words of the blind He
throws down Martin Douls coat and stick Theres your old rubbish now
Martin Doul and let you take it up for its all you have and walk off
through the world for if ever I meet you coming again if its seeing
or blind you are itself Ill bring out the big hammer and hit you a
welt with it will leave you easy till the judgment day

MARTIN DOUL  rousing himself with an effort  What call have you
to talk the like of that with myself

TIMMY  pointing to Molly Byrne  Its well you know what call
I have Its well you know a decent girl Im thinking to wed has no
right to have her heart scalded with hearing talk  and queer bad
talk Im thinking  from a raggylooking fool the like of you

MARTIN DOUL  raising his voice  Its making game of you she is
for what seeing girl would marry with yourself Look on him Molly look
on him Im saying for Im seeing him still and let you raise your
voice for the time is come and bid him go up into his forge and
be sitting there by himself sneezing and sweating and he beating
pothooks till the judgment day He seizes her arm again

MOLLY BYRNE Keep him off from me Timmy

TIMMY  pushing Martin Doul aside  Would you have me strike you
Martin Doul Go along now after your wife whos a fit match for you
and leave Molly with myself

MARTIN DOUL  despairingly  Wont you raise your voice Molly and
lay hells long curse on his tongue

MOLLY BYRNE  on Timmys left  Ill be telling him its destroyed
I am with the sight of you and the sound of your voice Go off now after
your wife and if she beats you again let you go after the tinker girls
is above running the hills or down among the sluts of the town
and youll learn one day maybe the way a man should speak with a
wellreared civil girl the like of me She takes Timmy by the arm
Come up now into the forge till hell be gone down a bit on the road
for its near afeard I am of the wild look he has come in his eyes

She goes into the forge Timmy stops in the doorway

TIMMY Let me not find you out here again Martin Doul He bares his
arm Its well you know Timmy the smith has great strength in his arm
and its a power of things it has broken a sight harder than the old
bone of your skull

He goes into the forge and pulls the door after him

MARTIN DOUL  stands a moment with his hand to his eyes  And
thats the last thing Im to set my sight on in the life of the world 
the villainy of a woman and the bloody strength of a man Oh God pity
a poor blind fellow the way I am this day with no strength in me to do
hurt to them at all He begins groping about for a moment then stops
Yet if Ive no strength in me Ive a voice left for my prayers and may
God blight them this day and my own soul the same hour with them the
way Ill see them after Molly Byrne and Timmy the smith the two of
them on a high bed and they screeching in hell Itll be a grand
thing that time to look on the two of them and they twisting and
roaring out and twisting and roaring again one day and the next day
and each day always and ever Its not blind Ill be that time and it
wont be hell to me Im thinking but the like of heaven itself and
its fine care Ill be taking the Lord Almighty doesnt know He turns
to grope out

CURTAIN




ACT III

The same Scene as in first Act but gap in centre has been filled with
briars or branches of some sort Mary Doul blind again gropes her way
in on left and sits as before She has a few rushes with her It is an
early spring day

MARY DOUL  mournfully  Ah God help me God help me the
blackness wasnt so black at all the other time as it is this time and
its destroyed Ill be now and hard set to get my living working alone
when its few are passing and the winds are cold She begins shredding
rushes Im thinking short days will be long days to me from this
time and I sitting here not seeing a blink or hearing a word and no
thought in my mind but long prayers that Martin Doulll get his reward
in a short while for the villainy of his heart Its great jokes the
peoplell be making now Im thinking and they pass me by pointing
their fingers maybe and asking what place is himself the way its no
quiet or decency Ill have from this day till Im an old woman with long
white hair and it twisting from my brow She fumbles with her hair and
then seems to hear something Listens for a moment Theres a queer
slouching step coming on the road  God help me hes coming surely

She stays perfectly quiet Martin Doul gropes in on right blind also

MARTIN DOUL  gloomily  The devil mend Mary Doul for putting lies
on me and letting on she was grand The devil mend the old Saint for
letting me see it was lies He sits down near her The devil mend
Timmy the smith for killing me with hard work and keeping me with an
empty windy stomach in me in the day and in the night Ten thousand
devils mend the soul of Molly Byrne  Mary Doul nods her head with
approval  and the bad wicked souls is hidden in all the women
of the world He rocks himself with his hand over his face Its
lonesome Ill be from this day and if living people is a bad lot yet
Mary Doul herself and she a dirty wrinkledlooking hag was better
maybe to be sitting along with than no one at all Ill be getting my
death now Im thinking sitting alone in the cold air hearing the
night coming and the blackbirds flying round in the briars crying to
themselves the time youll hear one cart getting off a long way in the
east and another cart getting off a long way in the west and a dog
barking maybe and a little wind turning the sticks He listens and
sighs heavily Ill be destroyed sitting alone and losing my senses
this time the way Im after losing my sight for itd make any person
afeard to be sitting up hearing the sound of his breath  he moves his
feet on the stones  and the noise of his feet when its a power
of queer things do be stirring little sticks breaking and the grass
moving  Mary Doul half sighs and he turns on her in horror  till
youd take your dying oath on sun and moon a thing was breathing on the
stones He listens towards her for a moment then starts up nervously
and gropes about for his stick Ill be going now Im thinking but
Im not sure what place my sticks in and Im destroyed with terror
and dread He touches her face as he is groping about and cries out
Theres a thing with a cold living face on it sitting up at my side
He turns to run away but misses his path and stumbles in against the
wall My road is lost on me now Oh merciful God set my foot on the
path this day and Ill be saying prayers morning and night and not
straining my ear after young girls or doing any bad thing till I die

MARY DOUL  indignantly  Let you not be telling lies to the
Almighty God

MARTIN DOUL Mary Doul is it Recovering himself with immense relief
Is it Mary Doul Im saying

MARY DOUL Theres a sweet tone in your voice Ive not heard for a
space Youre taking me for Molly Byrne Im thinking

MARTIN DOUL  coming towards her wiping sweat from his face 
Well sights a queer thing for upsetting a man Its a queer thing to
think Id live to this day to be fearing the like of you but if its
shaken I am for a short while Ill soon be coming to myself

MARY DOUL Youll be grand then and its no lie

MARTIN DOUL  sitting down shyly some way off  Youve no call to
be talking for Ive heard tell youre as blind as myself

MARY DOUL If I am Im bearing in mind Im married to a little dark
stump of a fellow looks the fool of the world and Ill be bearing in
mind from this day the great hullabuloo hes after making from hearing a
poor woman breathing quiet in her place

MARTIN DOUL And youll be bearing in mind Im thinking what you seen
a while back when you looked down into a well or a clear pool maybe
when there was no wind stirring and a good light in the sky

MARY DOUL Im minding that surely for if Im not the way the liars
were saying below I seen a thing in them pools put joy and blessing in
my heart She puts her hand to her hair again

MARTIN DOUL  laughing ironically  Well they were saying below
I was losing my senses but I never went any day the length of that
God help you Mary Doul if youre not a wonder for looks youre the
maddest female woman is walking the counties of the east

MARY DOUL  scornfully You were saying all times youd a great ear
for hearing the lies of the world A great ear God help you and you
think youre using it now

MARTIN DOUL If its not lies youre telling would you have me think
youre not a wrinkled poor woman is looking like three scores or two
scores and a half

MARY DOUL I would not Martin She leans forward earnestly For when
I seen myself in them pools I seen my hair would be gray or white
maybe in a short while and I seen with it that Id a face would be a
great wonder when itll have soft white hair falling around it the way
when Im an old woman there wont be the like of me surely in the seven
counties of the east

MARTIN DOUL  with real admiration  Youre a cute thinking woman
Mary Doul and its no lie

MARY DOUL  triumphantly  I am surely and Im telling you a
beautiful whitehaired woman is a grand thing to see for Im told when
Kitty Bawn was selling poteen below the young men itself would never
tire to be looking in her face

MARTIN DOUL  taking off his hat and feeling his head speaking with
hesitation  Did you think to look Mary Doul would there be a
whiteness the like of that coming upon me

MARY DOUL  with extreme contempt  On you God help you In a
short while youll have a head on you as bald as an old turnip youd see
rolling round in the muck You need never talk again of your fine looks
Martin Doul for the day of that talks gone for ever

MARTIN DOUL Thats a hard word to be saying for I was thinking if Id
a bit of comfort the like of yourself its not far off wed be from
the good days went before and thatd be a wonder surely But Ill never
rest easy thinking youre a gray beautiful woman and myself a pitiful
show

MARY DOUL I cant help your looks Martin Doul It wasnt myself made
you with your rats eyes and your big ears and your griseldy chin

MARTIN DOUL  rubs his chin ruefully then beams with delight 
Theres one thing youve forgot if youre a cute thinking woman itself

MARY DOUL Your slouching feet is it Or your hooky neck or your two
knees is black with knocking one on the other

MARTIN DOUL  with delighted scorn  Theres talking for a cute
woman Theres talking surely

MARY DOUL  puzzled at joy of his voice  If youd anything but
lies to say youd be talking to yourself

MARTIN DOUL  bursting with excitement  Ive this to say Mary
Doul Ill be letting my beard grow in a short while a beautiful
long white silken streamy beard you wouldnt see the like of in the
eastern world Ah a white beards a grand thing on an old man a
grand thing for making the quality stop and be stretching out their
hands with good silver or gold and a beards a thing youll never have
so you may be holding your tongue

MARY DOUL  laughing cheerfully  Well were a great pair surely
and its great times well have yet maybe and great talking before we
die

MARTIN DOUL Great times from this day with the help of the Almighty
God for a priest itself would believe the lies of an old man would have
a fine white beard growing on his chin

MARY DOUL Theres the sound of one of them twittering yellow birds do
be coming in the springtime from beyond the sea and therell be a fine
warmth now in the sun and a sweetness in the air the way itll be
a grand thing to be sitting here quiet and easy smelling the things
growing up and budding from the earth

MARTIN DOUL Im smelling the furze a while back sprouting on the hill
and if youd hold your tongue youd hear the lambs of Grianan though
its near drowned their crying is with the full river making noises in
the glen

MARY DOUL  listens  The lambs is bleating surely and theres
cocks and laying hens making a fine stir a mile off on the face of the
hill She starts

MARTIN DOUL Whats that is sounding in the west A faint sound of a
bell is heard

MARY DOUL Its not the churches for the winds blowing from the sea

MARTIN DOUL  with dismay  Its the old Saint Im thinking
ringing his bell

MARY DOUL The Lord protect us from the saints of God They listen
Hes coming this road surely

MARTIN DOUL  tentatively  Will we be running off Mary Doul

MARY DOUL What place would we run

MARTIN DOUL Theres the little path going up through the sloughs
If we reached the bank above where the elders do be growing no person
would see a sight of us if it was a hundred yeomen were passing itself
but Im afeard after the time we were with our sight well not find our
way to it at all

MARY DOUL  standing up  Youd find the way surely Youre a
grand man the world knows at finding your way winter or summer if there
was deep snow in it itself or thick grass and leaves maybe growing
from the earth

MARTIN DOUL  taking her hand  Come a bit this way its here it
begins They grope about gap Theres a tree pulled into the gap or a
strange thing happened since I was passing it before

MARY DOUL Would we have a right to be crawling in below under the
sticks

MARTIN DOUL Its hard set I am to know what would be right And isnt
it a poor thing to be blind when you cant run off itself and you
fearing to see

MARY DOUL  nearly in tears  Its a poor thing God help us and
what goodll our gray hairs be itself if we have our sight the way
well see them falling each day and turning dirty in the rain

The bell sounds nearby

MARTIN DOUL  in despair  Hes coming now and we wont get off
from him at all

MARY DOUL Could we hide in the bit of a briar is growing at the west
butt of the church

MARTIN DOUL Well try that surely He listens a moment Let you make
haste I hear them trampling in the wood They grope over to church

MARY DOUL Its the words of the young girls making a great stir in the
trees They find the bush Heres the briar on my left Martin Ill
go in first Im the big one and Im easy to see

MARTIN DOUL  turning his head anxiously  Its easy heard you are
and will you be holding your tongue

MARY DOUL  partly behind bush  Come in now beside of me They
kneel down still clearly visible Do you think they can see us now
Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL Im thinking they cant but Im hard set to know for the
lot of them young girls the devil save them have sharp terrible eyes
would pick out a poor man Im thinking and he lying below hid in his
grave

MARY DOUL Let you not be whispering sin Martin Doul or maybe its the
finger of God theyd see pointing to ourselves

MARTIN DOUL Its yourself is speaking madness Mary Doul havent you
heard the Saint say its the wicked do be blind

MARY DOUL If it is youd have a right to speak a big terrible word
would make the water not cure us at all

MARTIN DOUL What way would I find a big terrible word and I shook
with the fear and if I did itself whod know rightly if its good
words or bad would save us this day from himself

MARY DOUL Theyre coming I hear their feet on the stones

The Saint comes in on right with Timmy and Molly Byrne in holiday
clothes the others as before

TIMMY Ive heard tell Martin Doul and Mary Doul were seen this day
about on the road holy father and we were thinking youd have pity on
them and cure them again

SAINT I would maybe but where are they at all I have little time
left when I have the two of you wed in the church

MAT SIMON  at their seat  There are the rushes they do have lying
round on the stones Its not far off theyll be surely

MOLLY BYRNE  pointing with astonishment  Look beyond Timmy
They all look over and see Martin Doul

TIMMY Well Martins a lazy fellow to be lying in there at the height
of the day He goes over shouting Let you get up out of that You
were near losing a great chance by your sleepiness this day Martin
Doul The two of thems in it God help us all

MARTIN DOUL  scrambling up with Mary Doul  What is it you want
Timmy that you cant leave us in peace

TIMMY The Saints come to marry the two of us and Im after speaking
a word for yourselves the way hell be curing you now for if youre a
foolish man itself I do be pitying you for Ive a kind heart when
I think of you sitting dark again and you after seeing a while and
working for your bread Martin Doul takes Mary Douls hand and tries to
grope his way off right he has lost his hat and they are both covered
with dust and grass seeds

PEOPLE Youre going wrong Its this way Martin Doul

They push him over in front of the Saint near centre Martin Doul and
Mary Doul stand with piteous hangdog dejection

SAINT Let you not be afeard for theres great pity with the Lord

MARTIN DOUL We arent afeard holy father

SAINT Its many a time those that are cured with the well of the four
beauties of God lose their sight when a time is gone but those I cure
a second time go on seeing till the hour of death He takes the cover
from his can Ive a few drops only left of the water but with the
help of God Itll be enough for the two of you and let you kneel down
now upon the road Martin Doul wheels round with Mary Doul and tries to
get away

SAINT You can kneel down here Im saying well not trouble this time
going to the church

TIMMY  turning Martin Doul round angrily  Are you going mad in
your head Martin Doul Its here youre to kneel Did you not hear his
reverence and he speaking to you now

SAINT Kneel down Im saying the grounds dry at your feet

MARTIN DOUL  with distress  Let you go on your own way holy
father Were not calling you at all

SAINT Im not saying a word of penance or fasting itself for Im
thinking the Lord has brought you great teaching in the blindness of
your eyes so youve no call now to be fearing me but let you kneel
down till I give you your sight

MARTIN DOUL  more troubled  Were not asking our sight holy
father and let you walk on your own way and be fasting or praying
or doing anything that you will but leave us here in our peace at
the crossing of the roads for its best we are this way and were not
asking to see

SAINT  to the People  Is his mind gone that hes no wish to be
cured this day or to be living or working or looking on the wonders of
the world

MARTIN DOUL Its wonders enough I seen in a short space for the life of
one man only

SAINT  severely  I never heard tell of any person wouldnt have
great joy to be looking on the earth and the image of the Lord thrown
upon men

MARTIN DOUL  raising his voice  Them is great sights holy
father What was it I seen when I first opened my eyes but your own
bleeding feet and they cut with the stones That was a great sight
maybe of the image of God And what was it I seen my last day but
the villainy of hell looking out from the eyes of the girl youre coming
to marry  the Lord forgive you  with Timmy the smith That was a
great sight maybe And wasnt it great sights I seen on the roads when
the north winds would be driving and the skies would be harsh till
youd see the horses and the asses and the dogs itself maybe with
their heads hanging and they closing their eyes 

SAINT And did you never hear tell of the summer and the fine spring
and the places where the holy men of Ireland have built up churches to
the Lord No man isnt a madman Im thinking would be talking the like
of that and wishing to be closed up and seeing no sight of the grand
glittering seas and the furze that is opening above and will soon have
the hills shining as if it was fine creels of gold they were rising to
the sky

MARTIN DOUL Is it talking now you are of Knock and Ballavore Ah its
ourselves had finer sights than the like of them Im telling you when
we were sitting a while back hearing the birds and bees humming in every
weed of the ditch or when wed be smelling the sweet beautiful smell
does be rising in the warm nights when you do hear the swift flying
things racing in the air till wed be looking up in our own minds into
a grand sky and seeing lakes and big rivers and fine hills for taking
the plough

SAINT  to People  Theres little use talking with the like of
him

MOLLY BYRNE Its lazy he is holy father and not wanting to work for
a while before you had him cured he was always talking and wishing and
longing for his sight

MARTIN DOUL  turning on her  I was longing surely for sight but
I seen my fill in a short while with the look of my wife and the look
of yourself Molly Byrne when youd the queer wicked grin in your eyes
you do have the time youre making game with a man

MOLLY BYRNE Let you not mind him holy father for its bad things
he was saying to me a while back  bad things for a married man your
reverence  and youd do right surely to leave him in darkness if its
that is best fitting the villainy of his heart

TIMMY  to Saint  Would you cure Mary Doul your reverence who is
a quiet poor woman never did hurt to any or said a hard word saving
only when shed be vexed with himself or with young girls would be
making game of her below

SAINT  to Mary Doul  If you have any sense Mary kneel down at
my feet and Ill bring the sight again into your eyes

MARTIN DOUL  more defiantly  You will not holy father Would you
have her looking on me and saying hard words to me till the hour of
death

SAINT  severely  If shes wanting her sight I wouldnt have the
like of you stop her at all To Mary Doul Kneel down Im saying

MARY DOUL  doubtfully  Let us be as we are holy father and then
well be known again in a short while as the people is happy and blind
and be having an easy time with no trouble to live and we getting
halfpence on the road

MOLLY BYRNE Let you not be a raving fool Mary Doul Kneel down now
and let him give you your sight and himself can be sitting here if he
likes it best and taking halfpence on the road

TIMMY Thats the truth Mary and if its choosing a wilful blindness
you are Im thinking there isnt anyone in this place will ever be
giving you a hands turn or a haporth of meal or be doing the little
things you need to keep you at all living in the world

MAT SIMON If you had your sight Mary you could be walking up for him
and down with him and be stitching his clothes and keeping a watch on
him day and night the way no other woman would come near him at all

MARY DOUL  half persuaded  Thats the truth maybe

SAINT Kneel down now Im saying for its in haste I am to be going on
with the marriage and be walking my own way before the fall of night

THE PEOPLE Kneel down Mary Kneel down when youre bid by the Saint

MARY DOUL  looking uneasily towards Martin Doul  Maybe its right
they are and I will if you wish it holy father

She kneels down The Saint takes off his hat and gives it to some one
near him All the men take off their hats He goes forward a step to
take Martin Douls hand away from Mary Doul

SAINT  to Martin Doul  Go aside now were not wanting you here

MARTIN DOUL  pushes him away roughly and stands with his left hand
on Mary Douls shoulder  Keep off yourself holy father and let you
not be taking my rest from me in the darkness of my wife What call
has the like of you to be coming between married people  that youre
not understanding at all  and be making a great mess with the holy
water you have and the length of your prayers Go on now Im saying
and leave us here on the road

SAINT If it was a seeing man I heard talking to me the like of that Id
put a black curse on him would weigh down his soul till itd be falling
to hell but youre a poor blind sinner God forgive you and I dont
mind you at all He raises his can Go aside now till I give the
blessing to your wife and if you wont go with your own will there are
those standing by will make you surely

MARTIN DOUL  pulling Mary Doul  Come along now and dont mind
him at all

SAINT  imperiously to the People  Let you take that man and
drive him down upon the road Some men seize Martin Doul

MARTIN DOUL  struggling and shouting  Make them leave me go holy
father Make them leave me go Im saying and you may cure her this
day or do anything that you will

SAINT  to People  Let him be Let him be if his sense is come
to him at all

MARTIN DOUL  shakes himself loose feels for Mary Doul sinking
his voice to a plausible whine  You may cure herself surely holy
father I wouldnt stop you at all  and its great joy shell have
looking on your face  but let you cure myself along with her the way
Ill see when its lies shes telling and be looking out day and night
upon the holy men of God

He kneels down a little before Mary Doul

SAINT  speaking half to the People  Men who are dark a long while
and thinking over queer thoughts in their heads arent the like of
simple men who do be working every day and praying and living like
ourselves so if he has found a right mind at the last minute itself
Ill cure him if the Lord will and not be thinking of the hard
foolish words hes after saying this day to us all

MARTIN DOUL  listening eagerly  Im waiting now holy father

SAINT  with can in his hand close to Martin Doul  With the power
of the water from the grave of the four beauties of God with the power
of this water Im saying that I put upon your eyes  He raises
can

MARTIN DOUL  with a sudden movement strikes the can from the Saints
hand and sends it rocketing across stage He stands up People murmur
loudly  If Im a poor dark sinner Ive sharp ears God help me and
have left you with a big head on you and its well I heard the little
splash of the water you had there in the can Go on now holy father
for if youre a fine Saint itself its more sense is in a blind man
and more power maybe than youre thinking at all Let you walk on now
with your worn feet and your welted knees and your fasting holy ways
a thin pitiful arm The Saint looks at him for a moment severely then
turns away and picks up his can He pulls Mary Doul up For if its a
right some of you have to be working and sweating the like of Timmy
the smith and a right some of you have to be fasting and praying and
talking holy talk the like of yourself Im thinking its a good right
ourselves have to be sitting blind hearing a soft wind turning
round the little leaves of the spring and feeling the sun and we not
tormenting our souls with the sight of the gray days and the holy men
and the dirty feet is trampling the world

He gropes towards his stone with Mary Doul

MAT SIMON Itd be an unlucky fearful thing Im thinking to have
the like of that man living near us at all in the townland of Grianan
Wouldnt he bring down a curse upon us holy father from the heavens of
God

SAINT  tying his girdle  God has great mercy but great wrath for
them that sin

THE PEOPLE Go on now Martin Doul Go on from this place Let you not
be bringing great storms or droughts on us maybe from the power of the
Lord Some of them throw things at him

MARTIN DOUL  turning round defiantly and picking up a stone  Keep
off now the yelping lot of you or its more than one maybe will get a
bloody head on him with the pitch of my stone Keep off now and let
you not be afeard for were going on the two of us to the towns of the
south where the people will have kind voices maybe and we wont know
their bad looks or their villainy at all He takes Mary Douls hand
again Come along now and well be walking to the south for weve seen
too much of everyone in this place and its small joy wed have living
near them or hearing the lies they do be telling from the gray of dawn
till the night

MARY DOUL  despondingly  Thats the truth surely and wed have
a right to be gone if its a long way itself as Ive heard them say
where you do have to be walking with a slough of wet on the one side and
a slough of wet on the other and you going a stony path with a north
wind blowing behind They go out

TIMMY Theres a power of deep rivers with floods in them where you
do have to be lepping the stones and you going to the south so Im
thinking the two of them will be drowned together in a short while
surely

SAINT They have chosen their lot and the Lord have mercy on their
souls He rings his bell And let the two of you come up now into the
church Molly Byrne and Timmy the smith till I make your marriage and
put my blessing on you all

He turns to the church procession forms and the curtain comes down
as they go slowly into the church
