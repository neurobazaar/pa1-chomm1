I

THE FAMILY OF JOHN CLEMENS

A long time ago back in the early years of another century a family
named Clemens moved from eastern Tennessee to eastern Missourifrom a
small unheardof place called Pall Mall on Wolf River to an equally
small and unknown place called Florida on a tiny river named the Salt

That was a far journey in those days for railway trains in 1835 had not
reached the South and West and John Clemens and his family traveled in
an old twohorse barouche with two extra ridinghorses on one of which
rode the eldest child Orion Clemens a boy of ten and on the other
Jennie a slave girl

In the carriage with the parents were three other childrenPamela and
Margaret aged eight and five and little Benjamin three years old The
time was spring the period of the Old South and while these youngsters
did not realize that they were passing through a sort of Golden Age they
must have enjoyed the weeks of leisurely journeying toward what was then
the Far Westthe Promised Land

The Clemens fortunes had been poor in Tennessee John Marshall Clemens
the father was a lawyer a man of education but he was a dreamer too
full of schemes that usually failed Born in Virginia he had grown up
in Kentucky and married there Jane Lampton of Columbia a descendant of
the English Lamptons and the belle of her region They had left Kentucky
for Tennessee drifting from one small town to another that was always
smaller and with dwindling lawpractice John Clemens in time had been
obliged to open a poor little store which in the end had failed to pay
Jennie was the last of several slaves he had inherited from his Virginia
ancestors Besides Jennie his fortune now consisted of the horses and
barouche a very limited supply of money and a large unsalable tract of
east Tennessee land which John Clemens dreamed would one day bring his
children fortune

Readers of the Gilded Age will remember the journey of the Hawkins
family from the Knobs of Tennessee to Missouri and the important part
in that story played by the Tennessee land Mark Twain wrote those
chapters and while they are not history but fiction they are based
upon fact and the picture they present of family hardship and struggle
is not overdrawn The character of Colonel Sellers who gave the
Hawkinses a grand welcome to the new home was also real In life he was
James Lampton cousin to Mrs Clemens a gentle and radiant merchant of
dreams who believed himself heir to an English earldom and was always on
the verge of colossal fortune With others of the Lampton kin he was
already settled in Missouri and had written back glowing accounts though
perhaps not more glowing than those which had come from another relative
John Quarles brotherinlaw to Mrs Clemens a jovial wholehearted
optimist wellloved by all who knew him

It was a June evening when the Clemens family with the barouche and the
two outriders finally arrived in Florida and the place no doubt
seemed attractive enough then however it may have appeared later It
was the end of a long journey relatives gathered with fond welcome
prospects seemed bright Already John Quarles had opened a general store
in the little town Florida he said was certain to become a city
Salt River would be made navigable with a series of locks and dams He
offered John Clemens a partnership in his business

Quarles for that time and place was a rich man Besides his store he
had a farm and thirty slaves His brotherinlaws funds or lack of
them did not matter The two had married sisters That was capital
enough for his hearty nature So almost on the moment of arrival in the
new land John Clemens once more found himself established in trade

The next thing was to find a home There were twentyone houses in
Florida and none of them large The one selected by John and Jane
Clemens had two main rooms and a leanto kitchena small place and
lowlythe kind of a place that so often has seen the beginning of
exalted lives Christianity began with a babe in a manger Shakespeare
first saw the light in a cottage at Stratford Lincoln entered the world
by way of a leaky cabin in Kentucky and into the narrow limits of the
Clemens home in Florida on a bleak autumn dayNovember 30 1835there
was born one who under the name of Mark Twain would live to cheer and
comfort a tired world

The name Mark Twain had not been thought of then and probably no one
prophesied favorably for the newcomer who was small and feeble and not
overwelcome in that crowded household They named him Samuel after his
paternal grandfather and added Langhorne for an old frienda goodly
burden for so frail a wayfarer But more appropriately they called him
Little Sam or Sammy which clung to him through the years of his
delicate childhood

It seems a curious childhood as we think of it now Missouri was a
slave StateLittle Sams companions were as often black as white All
the children of that time and locality had negroes for playmates and
were cared for by them They were fond of their black companions and
would have felt lost without them The negro children knew all the best
ways of doing thingshow to work charms and spells the best way to cure
warts and heal stonebruises and to make it rain and to find lost
money They knew what signs meant and dreams and how to keep off
hoodoo and all negroes old and young knew any number of weird tales

John Clemens must have prospered during the early years of his Florida
residence for he added another slave to his householdUncle Ned a man
of all workand he built a somewhat larger house in one room of which
the kitchen was a big fireplace There was a wide hearth and always
plenty of wood and here after supper the children would gather with
Jennie and Uncle Ned and the latter would tell hairlifting tales of
hants and lonely roads and witchwork that would make his hearers
shiver with terror and delight and look furtively over their shoulders
toward the dark windowpanes and the hovering shadows on the walls
Perhaps it was not the healthiest entertainment but it was the kind to
cultivate an imagination that would one day produce Tom Sawyer and
Huck Finn

True Little Sam was very young at this period but even a little chap of
two or three would understand most of that fireside talk and get
impressions more vivid than if the understanding were complete He was
barely four when this earliest chapter of his life came to a close

John Clemens had not remained satisfied with Florida and his undertakings
there The town had not kept its promises It failed to grow and the
lockanddam scheme that would make Salt River navigable fell through
Then one of the children Margaret a blackeyed rosy little girl of
nine suddenly died This was in August 1839 A month or two later the
saddened family abandoned their Florida home and moved in wagons with
their household furnishings to Hannibal a Mississippi River town
thirty miles away There was only one girl left now Pamela twelve
years old but there was another boy baby Henry three years younger
than Little Samfour boys in all




II

THE NEW HOME AND UNCLE JOHN QUARLESS FARM

Hannibal was a town with prospects and considerable trade It was
slumbrous being a slave town but it was not dead John Clemens
believed it a promising place for business and opened a small general
store with Orion Clemens now fifteen a studious dreamy lad for clerk

The little city was also an attractive place of residence Mark Twain
remembered it as the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer
morning    the great Mississippi the magnificent Mississippi
rolling its milewide tide along  the dense forest away on the
other side

The white town was built against green hills and abutting the river
were bluffsHollidays Hill and Lovers Leap A distance below the town
was a cavea wonderful cave as every reader of Tom Sawyer knowswhile
out in the river toward the Illinois shore was the delectable island
that was one day to be the meetingplace of Toms pirate band and later
to become the hidingplace of Huck and Nigger Jim

The river itself was full of interest It was the highway to the outside
world Rafts drifted by smartly painted steamboats panted up and down
touching to exchange traffic and travelers a neverceasing wonder to
those simple shutin dwellers whom the telegraph and railway had not yet
reached That Hannibal was a pleasant place of residence we may believe
and what an attractive place for a boy to grow up in

Little Sam however was not yet ready to enjoy the island and the cave
He was still delicatethe least promising of the family He was queer
and fanciful and rather silent He walked in his sleep and was often
found in the middle of the night fretting with the cold in some dark
corner Once he heard that a neighbors children had the measles and
being very anxious to catch the complaint slipped over to the house and
crept into bed with an infected playmate Some days later Little Sams
relatives gathered about his bed to see him die He confessed long
after that the scene gratified him However he survived and fell into
the habit of running away usually in the direction of the river

You gave me more uneasiness than any child I had his mother once said
to him in her old age

I suppose you were afraid I wouldnt live he suggested

She looked at him with the keen humor which had been her legacy to him
No afraid you would she said Which was only her joke for she had
the tenderest of hearts and like all mothers had a weakness for the
child that demanded most of her mothers care It was chiefly on his
account that she returned each year to Florida to spend the summer on
John Quarless farm

If Uncle John Quarless farm was just an ordinary Missouri farm and his
slaves just average negroes they certainly never seemed so to Little
Sam There was a kind of glory about everything that belonged to Uncle
John and it was not all imagination for some of the spirit of that
jovial kindly hearted man could hardly fail to radiate from his
belongings

The farm was a large one for that locality and the farmhouse was a big
double log buildingthat is two buildings with a roofedover passage
between where in summer the lavish Southern meals were served brought
in on huge dishes by the negroes and left for each one to help himself
Fried chicken roast pig turkeys ducks geese venison just killed
squirrels rabbits partridges pheasants prairiechickens green corn
watermelona little boy who did not die on that bill of fare would be
likely to get well on it and to Little Sam the farm proved a lifesaver

It was in fact a heavenly place for a little boy In the corner of the
yard there were hickory and blackwalnut trees and just over the fence
the hill sloped past barns and cribs to a brook a rare place to wade
though there were forbidden pools Cousin Tabitha Quarles called
Puss his own age was Little Sams playmate and a slave girl Mary
who being six years older was supposed to keep them out of mischief
There were swings in the big shady pasture where Mary swung her charges
and ran under them until their feet touched the branches All the woods
were full of squirrels and birds and blooming flowers all the meadows
were gay with clover and butterflies and musical with singing
grasshoppers and calling larks the fencerows were full of wild
blackberries there were apples and peaches in the orchard and plenty of
melons ripening in the corn Certainly it was a glorious place

Little Sam got into trouble once with the watermelons One of them had
not ripened quite enough when he ate several slices of it Very soon
after he was seized with such terrible cramps that some of the household
did not think he could live

But his mother said Sammy will pull through He was not born to die
that way Which was a true prophecy Sammys slender constitution
withstood the strain It was similarly tested more than once during
those early years He was regarded as a curious child At times dreamy
and silent again wildheaded and noisy with sudden impulses that sent
him capering and swinging his arms into the wind until he would fall with
shrieks and spasms of laughter and madly roll over and over in the grass
It is not remembered that any one prophesied very well for his future at
such times

The negro quarters on Uncle Johns farm were especially fascinating In
one cabin lived a bedridden old woman whom the children looked upon with
awe She was said to be a thousand years old and to have talked with
Moses She had lost her health in the desert coming out of Egypt She
had seen Pharaoh drown and the fright had caused the bald spot on her
head She could ward off witches and dissolve spells

Uncle Danl was another favorite a kindhearted gentle soul who long
after as Nigger Jim in the Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn tales would
win worldwide love and sympathy

Through that faroff warm golden summertime Little Sam romped and
dreamed and grew He would return each summer to the farm during those
early years It would become a beautiful memory His mother generally
kept him there until the late fall when the chilly evenings made them
gather around the wide blazing fireplace Sixty years later he wrote

 I can see the room yet with perfect clearness I can see all
 its belongings all its details the familyroom of the house with
 the trundlebed in one corner and the spinningwheel in anothera
 wheel whose rising and falling wail heard from a distance was the
 mournfulest of all sounds to me and made me homesick and low
 spirited and filled my atmosphere with the wandering spirits of the
 dead the vast fireplace piled high with flaming logs from whose
 ends a sugary sap bubbled out but did not go to waste for we
 scraped it off and ate it    the lazy cat spread out on the
 rough hearthstones the drowsy dogs braced against the jambs
 blinking my aunt in one chimneycorner and my uncle in the other
 smoking his corncob pipe

It is hard not to tell more of the farm for the boy who was one day
going to write of Tom and Huck and the rest learned there so many things
that Tom and Huck would need to know

But he must have booklearning too Jane Clemens said On his return
to Hannibal that first summer she decided that Little Sam was ready for
school He was five years old and regarded as a stirring child

He drives me crazy with his didoes when hes in the house his mother
declared and when hes out of it Im expecting every minute that some
one will bring him home half dead

Mark Twain used to say that he had had nine narrow escapes from drowning
and it was at this early age that he was brought home one afternoon in a
limp state having been pulled from a deep hole in Bear Creek by a slave
girl

When he was restored his mother said I guess there wasnt much danger
People born to be hanged are safe in water

Mark Twains mother was the original of Aunt Polly in the story of Tom
Sawyer an outspoken keenwitted charitable woman whom it was good to
know She had a heart full of pity especially for dumb creatures She
refused to kill even flies and punished the cat for catching mice She
would drown young kittens when necessary but warmed the water for the
purpose She could be strict however with her children if occasion
required and recognized their faults

Little Sam was inclined to elaborate largely on fact A neighbor once
said to her You dont believe anything that child says I hope

Oh yes I know his average I discount him ninety per cent The rest
is pure gold

She declared she was willing to pay somebody to take him off her hands
for a part of each day and try to teach him manners A certain Mrs E
Horr was selected for the purpose

Mrs Horrs school on Main Street Hannibal was of the oldfashioned
kind There were pupils of all ages and everything was taught up to the
third reader and long division Pupils who cared to go beyond those
studies went to a Mr Cross on the hill facing what is now the public
square Mrs Horr received twentyfive cents a week for each pupil and
the rules of conduct were read daily After the rules came the ABC
class whose recitation was a handtohand struggle requiring no
studytime

The rules of conduct that first day interested Little Sam He wondered
how nearly he could come to breaking them and escape He experimented
during the forenoon and received a warning Another experiment would
mean correction He did not expect to be caught again but when he least
expected it he was startled by a command to go out and bring a stick for
his own punishment

This was rather dazing It was sudden and then he did not know much
about choosing sticks for such a purpose Jane Clemens had commonly used
her hand A second command was needed to start him in the right
direction and he was still dazed when he got outside He had the
forests of Missouri to select from but choice was not easy Everything
looked too big and competent Even the smallest switch had a wiry look
Across the way was a coopers shop There were shavings outside and one
had blown across just in front of him He picked it up and gravely
entering the room handed it to Mrs Horr So far as known it is the
first example of that humor which would one day make Little Sam famous
before all the world

It was a failure in this instance Mrs Horrs comic side may have
prompted forgiveness but discipline must be maintained

Samuel Langhorne Clemens she said he had never heard it all strung
together in that ominous way I am ashamed of you Jimmy Dunlap go
and bring a switch for Sammy And the switch that Jimmy Dunlap brought
was of a kind to give Little Sam a permanent distaste for school He
told his mother at noon that he did not care for education that he did
not wish to be a great man that his desire was to be an Indian and scalp
such persons as Mrs Horr In her heart Jane Clemens was sorry for him
but she openly said she was glad there was somebody who could take him in
hand

Little Sam went back to school but he never learned to like it A
school was ruled with a rod in those days and of the smaller boys Little
Sams back was sore as often as the next When the days of early summer
came again when from his desk he could see the sunshine lighting the
soft green of Hollidays Hill with the glint of the river and the purple
distance beyond it seemed to him that to be shut up with a Webster
spellingbook and a cross teacher was more than human nature could bear
There still exists a yellow slip of paper upon which in neat
oldfashioned penmanship is written

 MISS PAMELA CLEMENS

 Has won the love of her teacher and schoolmates by her amiable
 deportment and faithful application to her various studies

 E HORR Teacher


Thus we learn that Little Sams sister eight years older than himself
attended the same school and that she was a good pupil If any such
reward of merit was ever conferred on Little Sam it has failed to come
to light If he won the love of his teacher and playmates it was
probably for other reasons

Yet he must have learned somehow for he could read presently and was a
good speller for his age




IV

EDUCATION OUT OF SCHOOL

On their arrival in Hannibal the Clemens family had moved into a part of
what was then the Pavey Hotel They could not have remained there long
for they moved twice within the next few years and again in 1844 into a
new house which Judge Clemens as he was generally called had built
on Hill Streeta house still standing and known today as the Mark
Twain home

John Clemens had met varying fortunes in Hannibal Neither commerce nor
the practice of law had paid The office of justice of the peace to
which he was elected returned a fair income but his business losses
finally obliged him to sell Jennie the slave girl Somewhat later his
business failure was complete He surrendered everything to his
creditors even to his cow and household furniture and relied upon his
law practice and justice fees However he seems to have kept the
Tennessee land possibly because no one thought it worth taking There
had been offers for it earlier but none that its owner would accept It
appears to have been not even considered by his creditors though his own
faith in it never died

The struggle for a time was very bitter Orion Clemens now seventeen
had learned the printers trade and assisted the family with his wages
Mrs Clemens took a few boarders In the midst of this time of hardship
little Benjamin Clemens died He was ten years old It was the darkest
hour

Then conditions slowly improved There was more law practice and better
justice fees By 1844 Judge Clemens was able to build the house
mentioned abovea plain cheap house but a shelter and a home Sam
Clemenshe was hardly Little Sam any morewas at this time nine years
old His boyhood had begun

Heretofore he had been just a childwild and mischievous often
exasperating but still a childa delicate little lad to be worried
over mothered or spanked and put to bed Now at nine he had acquired
health with a sturdy ability to look out for himself as boys in such a
community will Sam as they now called him was grown up at nine
and wise for his years Not that he was old in spirit or mannerhe was
never that even to his deathbut he had learned a great number of
things many of them of a kind not taught at school

He had learned a good deal of natural history and botanythe habits of
plants insects and animals Mark Twains books bear evidence of this
early study His plants bugs and animals never do the wrong things
He was learning a good deal about men and this was often less pleasant
knowledge Once Little Samhe was still Little Sam thensaw an old man
shot down on Main Street at noon day He saw them carry him home lay
him on the bed and spread on his breast an open family Bible which
looked as heavy as an anvil He thought if he could only drag that great
burden away the poor old dying man would not breathe so heavily

He saw a young emigrant stabbed with a bowieknife by a drunken comrade
and two young men try to kill their uncle one holding him while the
other snapped repeatedly an Allen revolver which failed to go off Then
there was the drunken rowdy who proposed to raid the Welshmans house
one sultry threatening eveninghe saw that too With a boon
companion John Briggs he followed at a safe distance behind A widow
with her one daughter lived there They stood in the shadow of the dark
porch the man had paused at the gate to revile them The boys heard the
mothers voice warning the intruder that she had a loaded gun and would
kill him if he stayed where he was He replied with a tirade and she
warned him that she would count tenthat if he remained a second longer
she would fire She began slowly and counted up to five the man
laughing and jeering At six he grew silent but he did not go She
counted on seven eight nine

The boys watching from the dark roadside felt their hearts stop There
was a long pause then the final count followed a second later by a gush
of flame The man dropped his breast riddled At the same instant the
thunderstorm that had been gathering broke loose The boys fled wildly
believing that Satan himself had arrived to claim the lost soul

That was a day and locality of violent impulse and sudden action
Happenings such as these were not infrequent in a town like Hannibal
And there were events connected with slavery Sam once saw a slave
struck down and killed with a piece of slag for a trifling offense He
saw an Abolitionist attacked by a mob that would have lynched him had not
a Methodist minister defended him on a plea that he must be crazy He
did not remember in later years that he had ever seen a slave auction
but he added

 I am suspicious that it was because the thing was a commonplace
 spectacle and not an uncommon or impressive one I do vividly
 remember seeing a dozen black men and women chained together lying
 in a group on the pavement waiting shipment to a Southern slave
 market They had the saddest faces I ever saw

Readers of Mark Twains booksespecially the stories of Huck and Tom
will hardly be surprised to hear of these early happenings that formed so
large a portion of the authors early education Sam however did not
regard them as educationnot at the time They got into his dreams He
set them down as warnings or punishments intended to give him a taste
for a better life He felt that it was his conscience that made such
things torture him That was his mothers idea and he had a high
respect for her opinion in such matters Among other things he had seen
her one day defy a vicious and fierce Corsicana common terror in the
townwho had chased his grown daughter with a heavy rope in his hand
declaring he would wear it out on her Cautious citizens got out of the
way but Jane Clemens opened her door to the fugitive then instead of
rushing in and closing it spread her arms across it barring the way
The man raved and threatened her with the rope but she did not flinch
or show any sign of fear She stood there and shamed and defied him
until he slunk off crestfallen and conquered Any one as brave as his
mother must have a perfect conscience Sam thought and would know how to
take care of it In the darkness he would say his prayers especially
when a thunderstorm was coming and vow to begin a better life He
detested Sundayschool as much as he did dayschool and once his brother
Orion who was moral and religious had threatened to drag him there by
the collar but as the thunder got louder Sam decided that he loved
Sundayschool and would go the next Sunday without being invited

Sams days were not all disturbed by fierce events They were mostly
filled with pleasanter things There were picnics sometimes and
ferryboat excursions and any day one could roam the woods or fish
alone or in company The hills and woods around Hannibal were never
disappointing There was the cave with its marvels There was Bear
Creek where he had learned to swim He had seen two playmates drown
twice himself he had been dragged ashore more dead than alive once by
a slave girl another time by a slave manNeal Champ of the Pavey
Hotel But he had persevered and with success He could swim better
than any playmate of his age

It was the river that he cared for most It was the pathway that led to
the great world outside He would sit by it for hours and dream He
would venture out on it in a quietly borrowed boat when he was barely
strong enough to lift an oar He learned to know all its moods and
phases

More than anything in the world he hungered to make a trip on one of the
big smart steamers that were always passing You can hardly imagine
what it meant he reflected once to a boy in those days shut in as
we were to see those steamboats pass up and down and never take a trip
on them

It was at the mature age of nine that he found he could endure this no
longer One day when the big packet came down and stopped at Hannibal
he slipped aboard and crept under one of the boats on the upper deck
Then the signalbells rang the steamer backed away and swung into
midstream he was really going at last He crept from beneath the boat
and sat looking out over the water and enjoying the scenery Then it
began to raina regular downpour He crept back under the boat but his
legs were outside and one of the crew saw him He was dragged out and
at the next stop set ashore It was the town of Louisiana where there
were Lampton relatives who took him home Very likely the homecoming
was not entirely pleasant though a lesson too in his general
education

And always each summer there was the farm where his recreation was no
longer mere girl plays and swings with a colored nurse following about
but sports with his older boy cousins who went hunting with the men for
partridges by day and for coons and possums by night Sometimes the
little boy followed the hunters all night long and returned with them
through the sparkling and fragrant morning fresh hungry and
triumphant just in time for breakfast So it is no wonder that Little
Sam at nine was no longer Little Sam but plain Sam Clemens and grown
up If there were doubtful spots in his educationmatters related to
smoking and strong wordsit is also no wonder and experience even in
these lines was worth something in a book like Tom Sawyer

The boy Sam Clemens was not a particularly attractive lad He was rather
undersized and his head seemed too large for his body He had a mass of
light sandy hair which he plastered down to keep from curling His eyes
were keen and blue and his features rather large Still he had a fair
delicate complexion when it was not blackened by grime and tan a gentle
winning manner a smile and a slow way of speaking that made him a
favorite with his companions He did not talk much and was thought to
be rather dullwas certainly so in most of his lessonsbut for some
reason he never spoke that every playmate in hearing did not stop
whatever he was doing to listen Perhaps it would be a plan for a new
game or lark perhaps it was something droll perhaps it was just a
casual remark that his peculiar drawl made amusing His mother always
referred to his slow fashion of speech as Sammys long talk Her own
speech was even more deliberate though she seemed not to notice it Sam
was more like his mother than the others His brother Henry Clemens
three years younger was as unlike Sam as possible He did not have the
long talk and was a handsome obedient little fellow whom the
mischievous Sam loved to tease Henry was to become the Sid of Tom
Sawyer though he was in every way a finer character than Sid With the
death of little Benjamin Sam and Henry had been drawn much closer
together and in spite of Sams pranks loved each other dearly For
the pranks were only occasional and Sams love for Henry was constant
He fought for him oftener than with him

Many of the home incidents in the Tom Sawyer book really happened Sam
did clod Henry for getting him into trouble about the colored thread
with which he sewed his shirt when he came home from swimming he did
inveigle a lot of boys into whitewashing a fence for him he did give
painkiller to Peter the cat As for escaping punishment for his
misdeeds as described in the book this was a daily matter and his
methods suited the occasions For of course Tom Sawyer was Sam Clemens
himself almost entirely as most readers of that book have imagined
However we must have another chapter for Tom Sawyer and his doingsthe
real Tom and his real doings with those graceless lovable associates
Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn




V

TOM SAWYER AND HIS BAND

In beginning The Adventures of Tom Sawyer the author says Most of the
adventures recorded in this book really occurred and he tells us that
Huck Finn is drawn from life Tom Sawyer also though not from a single
individual being a composite of three boys whom Mark Twain had known

The three boys were himself almost entirely with traces of two
schoolmates John Briggs and Will Bowen John Briggs was also the
original of Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas As for Huck Finn the
RedHanded his original was a village waif named Tom Blankenship who
needed no change for his part in the story

The Blankenship family picked up an uncertain livelihood fishing and
hunting and lived at first under a tree in a bark shanty but later
moved into a large barnlike building back of the Clemens home on Hill
Street There were three male members of the household Old Ben the
father shiftless and dissolute young Ben the eldest sona doubtful
character with certain good traits and Tomthat is to say Huck who
was just as he is described in the booka ruin of rags a riverrat
kind of heart and accountable for his conduct to nobody in the world
He could come and go as he chose he never had to work or go to school
he could do all the things good and bad that other boys longed to do
and were forbidden To them he was the symbol of liberty his knowledge
of fishing trapping signs and of the woods and river gave value to his
society while the fact that it was forbidden made it necessary to Sam
Clemenss happiness

The Blankenships being handy to the back gate of the Hill Street house
he adopted them at sight Their free mode of life suited him He was
likely to be there at any hour of the day and Tom made catcall signals
at night that would bring Sam out on the shed roof at the back and down a
little trellis and flight of steps to the group of boon companions
which besides Tom usually included John Briggs Will Pitts and the two
younger Bowen boys They were not malicious boys but just mischievous
funloving boyslittle boys of ten or twelverather thoughtless being
mainly bent on having a good time

They had a wide field of action they ranged from Hollidays Hill on the
north to the cave on the south and over the fields and through all the
woods between They explored both banks of the river the islands and
the deep wilderness of the Illinois shore They could run like turkeys
and swim like ducks they could handle a boat as if born in one No
orchard or melonpatch was entirely safe from them No dog or slave
patrol was so watchful that they did not sooner or later elude it They
borrowed boats with or without the owners consentit did not matter

Most of their expeditions were harmless enough They often cruised up to
Turtle Island about two miles above Hannibal and spent the day
feasting There were quantities of turtles and their eggs there and
mussels and plenty of fish Fishing and swimming were their chief
pastimes with incidental raiding for adventure Bear Creek was their
swimmingplace by day and the riverfront at nightfalla favorite spot
being where the railroad bridge now ends It was a good distance across
to the island where in the book Tom Sawyer musters his pirate band and
where later Huck found Nigger Jim but quite often in the evening they
swam across to it and when they had frolicked for an hour or more on the
sandbar at the head of the island they would swim back in the dusk
breasting the strong steady Mississippi current without exhaustion or
dread They could swim all day those little scamps and seemed to have
no fear Once during his boyhood Sam Clemens swam across to the
Illinois side then turned and swam back again without landing a
distance of at least two miles as he had to go He was seized with a
cramp on the return trip His legs became useless and he was obliged to
make the remaining distance with his arms

The adventures of Sam Clemens and his comrades would fill several books
of the size of Tom Sawyer Many of them are of course forgotten now
but those still remembered show that Mark Twain had plenty of real
material

It was not easy to get money in those days and the boys were often
without it Once Huck Blankenship had the skin of a coon he had
captured and offered to sell it to raise capital At Selmss store on
Wild Cat Corner the coonskin would bring ten cents But this was not
enough The boys thought of a plan to make it bring more Selmss back
window was open and the place where he kept his pelts was pretty handy
Huck went around to the front door and sold the skin for ten cents to
Selms who tossed it back on the pile Then Huck came back and after
waiting a reasonable time crawled in the open window got the
coonskin and sold it to Selms again He did this several times that
afternoon and the capital of the band grew But at last John Pierce
Selmss clerk said

Look here Mr Selms theres something wrong about this That boy has
been selling us coonskins all the afternoon

Selms went back to his pile of pelts There were several sheepskins and
some cowhides but only one coonskinthe one he had that moment
bought

Selms himself in after years used to tell this story as a great joke

One of the boys occasional pastimes was to climb Hollidays Hill and
roll down big stones to frighten the people who were driving by
Hollidays Hill above the road was steep a stone once started would go
plunging downward and bound across the road with the deadly momentum of a
shell The boys would get a stone poised then wait until they saw a
team approaching and calculating the distance would give the boulder a
start Dropping behind the bushes they would watch the sudden effect
upon the party below as the great missile shot across the road a few
yards before them This was huge sport but they carried it too far
For at last they planned a grand climax that would surpass anything
before attempted in the stonerolling line

A monstrous boulder was lying up there in the right position to go
downhill once started It would be a glorious thing to see that
great stone go smashing down a hundred yards or so in front of some
peacefulminded countryman jogging along the road Quarrymen had been
getting out rock not far away and had left their picks and shovels handy
The boys borrowed the tools and went to work to undermine the big stone
They worked at it several hours If their parents had asked them to work
like that they would have thought they were being killed

Finally while they were still digging the big stone suddenly got loose
and started down They were not ready for it at all Nobody was coming
but an old colored man in a cart their splendid stone was going to be
wasted

One could hardly call it wasted however they had planned for a
thrilling result and there was certainly thrill enough while it lasted
In the first place the stone nearly caught Will Bowen when it started
John Briggs had that moment quit digging and handed Will the pick Will
was about to take his turn when Sam Clemens leaped aside with a yell

Lookout boys shes coming

She came The huge boulder kept to the ground at first then gathering
momentum it went bounding into the air About halfway down the hill it
struck a sapling and cut it clean off This turned its course a little
and the negro in the cart hearing the noise and seeing the great mass
come crashing in his direction made a wild effort to whip up his mule

The boys watched their bomb with growing interest It was headed
straight for the negro also for a coopershop across the road It made
longer leaps with every bound and wherever it struck fragments and
dust would fly The shop happened to be empty but the rest of the
catastrophe would call for close investigation They wanted to fly but
they could not move until they saw the rock land It was making mighty
leaps now and the terrified negro had managed to get exactly in its
path The boys stood holding their breath their mouths open

Then suddenly they could hardly believe their eyes a little way above
the road the boulder struck a projection made one mighty leap into the
air sailed clear over the negro and his mule and landed in the soft
dirt beyond the road only a fragment striking the shop damaging but
not wrecking it Half buried in the ground the great stone lay there
for nearly forty years then it was broken up It was the last rock the
boys ever rolled down Nearly sixty years later John Briggs and Mark
Twain walked across Hollidays Hill and looked down toward the river
road

Mark Twain said It was a mighty good thing John that stone acted the
way it did We might have had to pay a fancy price for that old darky I
can see him yet1

It can be no harm now to confess that the boy Sam Clemensa pretty
small boy a good deal less than twelve at the time and by no means
large for his yearswas the leader of this unhallowed band In any
case truth requires this admission If the band had a leader it was
Sam just as it was Tom Sawyer in the book They were always ready to
listen to himthey would even stop fishing to do thatand to follow his
plans They looked to him for ideas and directions and he gloried in
being a leader and showing off just as Tom did in the book It seems
almost a pity that in those faroff barefoot days he could not have
looked down the years and caught a glimpse of his splendid destiny

But of literary fame he could never have dreamed The chief ambition
the permanent ambitionof every Hannibal boy was to be a pilot The
pilot in his splendid glass perch with his supreme power and princely
salary was to them the noblest of all human creatures An elder Bowen
boy was already a pilot and when he came home as he did now and then
his person seemed almost too sacred to touch

Next to being a pilot Sam thought he would like to be a pirate or a
bandit or a trapperscoutsomething gorgeous and aweinspiring where
his word his nod would still be law The river kept his river ambition
always fresh and with the cave and the forest round about helped him to
imagine those other things

The cave was the joy of his heart It was a real cave not merely a
hole but a marvel of deep passages and vaulted chambers that led back
into the bluffs and far down into the earth even below the river some
said Sam Clemens never tired of the cave He was willing any time to
quit fishing or swimming or melonhunting for the threemile walk or
pull that brought them to its mystic door With its long corridors its
royal chambers hung with stalactites its remote hidingplaces it was
exactly suitable Sam thought to be the lair of an outlaw and in it he
imagined and carried out adventures which his faithful followers may not
always have understood though enjoying them none the less for that
reason

In Tom Sawyer Indian Joe dies in the cave He did not die there in real
life but was lost there once and was very weak when they found him He
was not as bad as painted in the book though he was dissolute and
accounted dangerous and when one night he died in reality there came a
thunderstorm so terrific that Sam Clemens at home in bed was certain
that Satan had come in person for the halfbreeds soul He covered his
head and said his prayers with fearful anxiety lest the evil one might
decide to save another trip by taking him along then

The treasuredigging adventure in the book had this foundation in fact
It was said that two French trappers had once buried a chest of gold
about two miles above Hannibal and that it was still there Tom
Blankenship Huck one morning said he had dreamed just where the
treasure was and that if the boysSam Clemens and John Briggswould go
with him and help dig he would divide The boys had great faith in
dreams especially in Hucks dreams They followed him to a place with
some shovels and picks and he showed them just where to dig Then he
sat down under the shade of a pawpawbush and gave orders

They dug nearly all day Huck didnt dig any himself because he had
done the dreaming which was his share They didnt find the treasure
that day and next morning they took two long iron rods to push and drive
into the ground until they should strike something They struck a number
of things but when they dug down it was never the money they found
That night the boys said they wouldnt dig any more

But Huck had another dream He dreamed the gold was exactly under the
little pawpawtree This sounded so circumstantial that they went back
and dug another day It was hot weather tooAugustand that night
they were nearly dead Even Huck gave it up then He said there was
something wrong about the way they dug

This differs a good deal from the treasure incident in the book but it
shows us what respect the boys had for the gifts of the ragamuffin
original of Huck Finn Tom Blankenships brother Ben was also used and
very importantly in the creation of our beloved Huck Ben was
considerably older but certainly no more reputable than Tom He
tormented the smaller boys and they had little love for him Yet
somewhere in Ben Blankenships nature there was a fine generous strain
of humanity that provided Mark Twain with that immortal episodethe
sheltering of Nigger Jim This is the real story

 A slave ran off from Monroe County Missouri and got across the
 river into Illinois Ben used to fish and hunt over there in the
 swamps and one day found him It was considered a most worthy act
 in those days to return a runaway slave in fact it was a crime not
 to do it Besides there was for this one a reward of fifty
 dollarsa fortune to ragged outcast Ben Blankenship That money
 and the honor he could acquire must have been tempting to the waif
 but it did not outweigh his human sympathy Instead of giving him
 up and claiming the reward Ben kept the runaway over there in the
 marshes all summer The negro fished and Ben carried him scraps of
 other food Then by and by the facts leaked out Some wood
 choppers went on a hunt for the fugitive and chased him to what was
 called Bird Slough There trying to cross a drift he was drowned

Hucks struggle in the book is between conscience and the law on one
side and deep human sympathy on the other Ben Blankenships struggle
supposing there was one would be between sympathy and the offered
reward Neither conscience nor law would trouble him It was his native
humanity that made him shelter the runaway and it must have been strong
and genuine to make him resist the lure of the fiftydollar prize

There was another chapter to this incident A few days after the
drowning of the runaway Sam Clemens and his band made their way to the
place and were pushing the drift about when all at once the negro shot
up out of the water straight and terrible a full halflength in the
air He had gone down foremost and had been caught in the drift The
boys did not stop to investigate but flew in terror to report their
tale

Those early days seem to have been full of gruesome things In The
Innocents Abroad the author tells how he once spent a night in his
fathers office and discovered there a murdered man This was a true
incident The man had been stabbed that afternoon and carried into the
house to die Sam and John Briggs had been playing truant all day and
knew nothing of the matter Sam thought the office safer than his home
where his mother was probably sitting up for him He climbed in by a
window and lay down on the lounge but did not sleep Presently he
noticed what appeared to be an unusual shape on the floor He tried to
turn his face to the wall and forget it but that would not do In agony
he watched the thing until at last a square of moonlight gradually
revealed a sight that he never forgot In the book he says

 I went away from there I do not say that I went in any sort of
 hurry but I simply wentthat is sufficient I went out of the
 window and I carried the sash along with me I did not need the
 sash but it was handier to take it than to leave it and so I took
 it I was not scared but I was considerable agitated

Sam was not yet twelve for his father was no longer living when the boy
had reached that age And how many things had crowded themselves into
his few brief years We must be content here with only a few of them
Our chapter is already too long

Ministers and deacons did not prophesy well for Sam Clemens and his mad
companions They spoke feelingly of state prison and the gallows But
the boys were a disappointing lot Will Bowen became a fine riverpilot
Will Pitts was in due time a leading merchant and bank president John
Briggs grew into a welltodo and highly respected farmer Huck Finn
which is to say Tom Blankenshipdied an honored citizen and justice of
the peace in a Western town As for Sam Clemens we shall see what he
became as the chapters pass

1 John Briggs died in 1907 earlier in the same year the writer of this
memoir spent an afternoon with him and obtained from him most of the
material for this chapter




VI

CLOSING SCHOOLDAYS

Sam was at Mr Crosss school on the Square in due time and among the
pupils were companions that appealed to his gentler side There were the
Robards boysGeorge the best Latin scholar and John who always won
the goodconduct medal and would one day make all the other boys envious
by riding away with his father to California his curls of gold blowing
in the wind

There was Buck Brown a rival speller and John Garth who would marry
little Helen Kercheval and Jimmy MacDaniel whom it was well to know
because his father kept a pastryshop and he used to bring cakes and
candy to school

There were also a number of girls Bettie Ormsley Artemisia Briggs and
Jennie Brady were among the girls he remembered in later years and Mary
Miller who was nearly double his age and broke his heart by getting
married one day a thing he had not expected at all

Yet through it all he appears like Tom Sawyer to have had one faithful
sweetheart In the book it is Becky Thatcherin real life she was Laura
Hawkins The Clemens and Hawkins families lived opposite and the
children were early acquainted The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main
was very gentle when he was playing at housebuilding with little Laura
and once when he dropped a brick on her finger he cried the louder and
longer of the two

For he was a tenderhearted boy He would never abuse an animal except
when his tendency to mischief ran away with him as in the painkiller
incident He had a real passion for cats Each summer he carried his
cat to the farm in a basket and it always had a place by him at the
table He loved flowersnot as a boy botanist or gardener but as a
companion who understood their thoughts He pitied dead leaves and dry
weeds because their lives were ended and they would never know summer
again or grow glad with another spring Even in that early time he had
that deeper sympathy which one day would offer comfort to humanity and
make every man his friend

But we are drifting away from Sam Clemenss schooldays They will not
trouble us much longer now More than anything in the world Sam detested
school and he made any excuse to get out of going It is hard to say
just why unless it was the restraint and the long hours of confinement

The Square in Hannibal where stood the school of Mr Cross was a grove
in those days with plumtrees and hazelbushes and grapevines When
spring came the children gathered flowers at recess climbed trees and
swung in the vines It was a happy place enough onlyit was school
To Sam Clemens the spellingbee every Friday afternoon was the one thing
that made it worth while Sam was a leader at spellingit was one of
his giftshe could earn compliments even from Mr Cross whose name it
would seem was regarded as descriptive Once in a moment of inspiration
Sam wrote on his late

 Cross by name and Cross by nature
 Cross jumped over an Irish potato

John Briggs thought this a great effort and urged the author to write it
on the blackboard at noon Sam hesitated

Oh pshaw said John I wouldnt be afraid to do it

I dare you to do it said Sam

This was enough While Mr Cross was at dinner John wrote in a large
hand the fine couplet The teacher returned and called the school to
order He looked at the blackboard then searchingly at John Briggs
The handwriting was familiar

Did you do that he asked ominously

It was a time for truth

Yes sir said John

Come here And John came and paid handsomely for his publishing
venture Sam Clemens expected that the author would be called for next
but perhaps Mr Cross had exhausted himself on John Sam did not often
escape His back kept fairly warm from one flailing to the next

Yet he usually wore one of the two medals offered in that schoolthe
medal for spelling Once he lost it by leaving the first r out of
February Laura Hawkins was on the floor against him and he was a
gallant boy If it had only been Huck Brown he would have spelled that
and all the other months backward to show off There were moments of
triumph that almost made school worth while the rest of the time it was
prison and servitude

But then one day came freedom Judge Clemens who in spite of
misfortune had never lost faith in humanity indorsed a large note for a
neighbor and was obliged to pay it Once more all his property was
taken away Only a few scanty furnishings were rescued from the wreck
A St Louis cousin saved the home but the Clemens family could not
afford to live in it They moved across the street and joined
housekeeping with another family

Judge Clemens had one hope left He was a candidate for the clerkship of
the surrogate court a good office and believed his election sure His
business misfortunes had aroused wide sympathy He took no chances
however and made a houseto house canvas of the district regardless of
the weather probably undermining his health He was elected by a large
majority and rejoiced that his worries were now at an end They were
indeed over At the end of February he rode to the county seat to take
the oath of office He returned through a drenching storm and reached
home nearly frozen Pneumonia set in and a few days later he was
dying His one comfort now was the Tennessee land He said it would
make them all rich and happy Once he whispered

Cling to the land cling to the land and wait Let nothing beguile it
away from you

He was a man who had rarely displayed affection for his children But
presently he beckoned to Pamela now a lovely girl of nineteen and
putting his arm around her neck kissed her for the first time in years

Let me die he said

He did not speak again A little more and his worries had indeed ended
The hard struggle of an upright impractical man had come to a close
This was in March 1847 John Clemens had lived less than fortynine
years

The children were dazed They had loved their father and honored his
nobility of purpose The boy Sam was overcome with remorse He recalled
his wildness and disobediencea thousand things trifling enough at the
time but heartbreaking now Boy and man Samuel Clemens was never
spared by remorse Leading him into the room where his father lay his
mother said some comforting words and asked him to make her a promise

He flung himself into her arms sobbing I will promise anything if you
wont make me go to school Anything

After a moment his mother said No Sammy you need not go to school any
more Only promise me to be a better boy Promise not to break my
heart

He gave his promise to be faithful and industrious and upright like his
father Such a promise was a serious matter and Sam Clemens underneath
all was a serious lad He would not be twelve until November but his
mother felt that he would keep his word

Orion Clemens returned to St Louis where he was receiving a salary of
ten dollars a weekhigh wage for those daysout of which he could send
three dollars weekly to the family Pamela who played the guitar and
piano very well gave music lessons and so helped the family fund
Pamela Clemens the original of Cousin Mary in Tom Sawyer was a sweet
and noble girl Henry was too young to work but Sam was apprenticed to
a printer named Ament who had recently moved to Hannibal and bought a
weekly paper The Courier Sam agreed with his mother that the
printing trade offered a chance for further education without attending
school and then some day there might be wages




VII

THE APPRENTICE

The terms of Samuel Clemenss apprenticeship were the usual thing for
that day board and clothesmore board than clothes and not much of
either Mark Twain used to say

I was supposed to get two suits of clothes a year but I didnt get
them I got one suit and took the rest out in Aments old garments
which didnt fit me in any noticeable way I was only about half as big
as he was and when I had on one of his shirts I felt as if I had on a
circustent I had to turn the trousers up to my ears to make them short
enough

Another apprentice a huge creature named Wales McCormick was so large
that Aments clothes were much too small for him The two apprentices
fitted out with their employers castoff garments were amusing enough
no doubt Sam and Wales ate in the kitchen at first but later at the
family table with Mr and Mrs Ament and Pet McMurry a journeyman
printer McMurry was a happy soul as one could almost guess from his
name He had traveled far and learned much What the two apprentices
did not already know Pet McMurry could teach them Sam Clemens had
promised to be a good boy and he was so by the standards of boyhood
He was industrious regular at his work quick to learn kind and
truthful Angels could hardly be more than that in a printingoffice
But when food was scarce even an angela young printerangelcould
hardly resist slipping down the cellar stairs at night for raw potatoes
onions and apples which they cooked in the office where the boys slept
on a pallet on the floor Wales had a wonderful way of cooking a potato
which his fellow apprentice never forgot

How one wishes for a photograph of Sam Clemens at that period But in
those days there were only daguerreotypes and they were expensive
things There is a letter though written long afterward by Pet
McMurry to Mark Twain which contains this paragraph

 If your memory extends so far back you will recall a little sandy
 haired boy of nearly a quarter of a century ago in the printing
 office at Hannibal over the Brittingham drugstore mounted upon a
 little box at the case who used to love to sing so well the
 expression of the poor drunken man who was supposed to have fallen
 by the wayside If ever I get up again Ill stay upif I kin

And with this portrait we must be contentwe cannot doubt its truth

Sam was soon office favorite and in time became chief standby When he
had been at work a year he could set type accurately run the job press
to the tune of Annie Laurie and he had charge of the circulation
That is to say he carried the papersa mission of real importance for
a long sagging span of telegraphwire had reached across the river to
Hannibal and Mexicanwar news delivered hot from the front gave the
messenger a fine prestige

He even did editing of a kind That is to say when Ament was not in
the office and copy was needed Sam hunted him up explained the
situation and saw that the necessary matter was produced He was not
ambitious to writenot then He wanted to be a journeyman printer like
Pet and travel and see the world Sometimes he thought he would like to
be a clown or end man in a minstrel troupe Once for a week he served
as subject for a traveling hypnotistand was dazzled by his success

But he stuck to printing and rapidly became a neat capable workman
Ament gave him a daily task after which he was free By three in the
afternoon he was likely to finish his stint Then he was off for the
river or the cave joining his old comrades Or perhaps he would go with
Laura Hawkins to gather wild columbine on the high cliff above the river
known as Lovers Leap When winter came these two sometimes went to
Bear Creek skating or together they attended parties where the
oldfashioned games RingaroundRosy and Dusty Miller were the chief
amusements

In The Gilded Age Laura Hawkins at twelve is pictured with her dainty
hands propped into the ribbonbordered pockets of her apron    a
vision to warm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest That
was the real Laura though her story in that book in no way resembles the
reality

It was just at this time that an incident occurred which may be looked
back upon now as a turningpoint in Samuel Clemenss life Coming home
from the office one afternoon he noticed a square of paper being swept
along by the wind He saw that it was printedwas interested
professionally in seeing what it was like He chased the flying scrap
and overtook it It was a leaf from some old history of Joan of Arc and
pictured the hard lot of the maid in the tower at Rouen reviled and
mistreated by her ruffian captors There were some paragraphs of
description but the rest was pitiful dialogue

Sam had never heard of Joan beforehe knew nothing of history He was
no reader Orion was fond of books and Pamela even little Henry had
read more than Sam But now as he read there awoke in him a deep
feeling of pity and indignation and with it a longing to know more of
the tragic story It was an interest that would last his life through
and in the course of time find expression in one of the rarest books ever
written

The first result was that Sam began to read He hunted up everything he
could find on the subject of Joan and from that went into French history
in generalindeed into history of every kind Samuel Clemens had
suddenly become a readeralmost a student He even began the study of
languages German and Latin but was not able to go on for lack of time
and teachers

He became a hater of tyranny a champion of the weak Watching a game of
marbles or tops he would remark to some offender in his slow drawling
way You mustnt cheat that boy

And the cheating stopped or trouble followed




VIII

ORIONS PAPER

A Hannibal paper the Journal was for sale under a mortgage of five
hundred dollars and Orion Clemens returning from St Louis borrowed
the money and bought it Sams two years apprenticeship with Ament had
been completed and Orion felt that together they could carry on the
paper and win success Henry Clemens now eleven was also taken out of
school to learn typesetting

Orion was a better printer than proprietor Like so many of his family
he was a visionary gentle and credulous ready to follow any new idea
Much advice was offered him and he tried to follow it all

He began with great hopes and energy He worked like a slave and did not
spare the others The paper was their hope of success Sam especially
was driven There were no more free afternoons In some chapters
written by Orion Clemens in later life he said

 I was tyrannical and unjust to Sam He was swift and clean as a
 good journeyman I gave him takes and if he got through well I
 begrudged him the time and made him work more

Orion did not mean to be unjust The struggle against opposition and
debt was bitter He could not be considerate

The paper for a time seemed on the road to success but Orion worked too
hard and tried too many schemes His enthusiasm waned and most of his
schemes turned out poorly By the end of the year the Journal was on
the down grade

In time when the need of money became great Orion made a trip to
Tennessee to try to raise something on the land which they still held
there He left Sam in charge of the paper and though its proprietor
returned emptyhanded his journey was worth while for it was during his
absence that Samuel Clemens began the career that would one day make him
Mark Twain

Sam had concluded to edit the paper in a way that would liven up the
circulation He had never written anything for print but he believed he
knew what the subscribers wanted The editor of a rival paper had been
crossed in love and was said to have tried to drown himself Sam wrote
an article telling all the history of the affair giving names and
details Then on the back of two big wooden letters used for
billprinting he engraved illustrations of the victim wading out
into the river testing the depth of the water with a stick

The paper came out and the demand for it kept the Washington handpress
busy The injured editor sent word that he was coming over to thrash the
whole Journal staff but he left town instead for the laugh was too
general

Sam also wrote a poem which startled orthodox readers Then Orion
returned and reduced him to the ranks In later years Orion saw his
mistake

 I could have distanced all competitors even then he wrote
 if I had recognized Sams ability and let him go ahead merely
 keeping him from offending worthy persons

Sam was not discouraged He liked the taste of print He sent two
anecdotes to the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post Both were accepted
without payment of course in those daysand when they appeared he
walked on air This was in 1851 Nearly sixty years later he said

 Seeing them in print was a joy which rather exceeded anything in
 that line I have ever experienced since

However he wrote nothing further for the Post Orion printed two of
his sketches in the Journal which was the extent of his efforts at
this time None of this early work has been preserved Files of the
Post exist but the sketches were unsigned and could hardly be
identified

The Hannibal paper dragged along from year to year Orion could pay
nothing on the mortgagefinancial matters becoming always worse He
could barely supply the plainest food and clothing for the family Sam
and Henry got no wages of course Then real disaster came A cow got
into the office one night upset a typecase and ate up two composition
rollers Somewhat later a fire broke out and did considerable damage
There was partial insurance with which Orion replaced a few necessary
articles then to save rent he moved the office into the front room of
the home on Hill Street where they were living again at this time

Samuel Clemens however now in his eighteenth year felt that he was no
longer needed in Hannibal He was a capable workman with little to do
and no reward Orion made irritable by his misfortunes was not always
kind Pamela who meantime had married well was settled in St Louis
Sam told his mother that he would visit Pamela and look about the city
There would be work in St Louis at good wages

He was going farther than St Louis but he dared not tell her Jane
Clemens consenting sighed as she put together his scanty belongings
Sam was going away He had been a good boy of late years but her faith
in his resisting powers was not strong Presently she held up a little
Testament

I want you to take hold of the other end of this Sam she said and
make me a promise

The slim wiry woman of fortynine grayeyed tender and resolute
faced the faircheeked youth of seventeen his eyes as piercing and
unwavering as her own How much alike they were

I want you Jane Clemens said to repeat after me Sam these words I
do solemnly swear that I will not throw a card or drink a drop of liquor
while I am gone

He repeated the vow after her and she kissed him

Remember that Sam and write to us she said

And so writes Orion he went wandering in search of that comfort and
advancement and those rewards of industry which he had failed to find
where I wasgloomy taciturn and selfish I not only missed his labor
we all missed his abounding activity and merriment

THE OPEN ROAD

Samuel Clemens went to visit his sister Pamela in St Louis and was
presently at work setting type on the Evening News He had no
intention however of staying there His purpose was to earn money
enough to take him to New York City The railroad had by this time
reached St Louis and he meant to have the grand experience of a long
journey on the cars Also there was a Crystal Palace in New York
where a worlds exposition was going on

Trains were slow in 1853 and it required several days and nights to go
from St Louis to New York City but to Sam Clemens it was a wonderful
journey All day he sat looking out of the window eating when he chose
from the food he carried curling up in his seat at night to sleep He
arrived at last with a few dollars in his pocket and a tendollar bill
sewed into the lining of his coat

New York was rather larger than he expected All of the lower end of
Manhattan Island was covered by it The Crystal Palacesome distance
outstood at Fortysecond Street and Sixth Avenuethe present site of
Bryant Park All the worlds newest wonders were to be seen therea
dazzling exhibition A fragment of the letter which Sam Clemens wrote to
his sister Pamelathe earliest piece of Mark Twains writing that has
been preservedexpresses his appreciation of the big fair

 From the gallery second floor you have a glorious sightthe
 flags of the different countries represented the lofty dome
 glittering jewelry gaudy tapestry etc with the busy crowd
 passing to and frotis a perfect fairy palacebeautiful beyond
 description

 The machinery department is on the main floor but I cannot
 enumerate any of it on account of the lateness of the hour past one
 oclock It would take more than a week to examine everything on
 exhibition and I was only in a little over two hours tonight I
 only glanced at about onethird of the articles and having a poor
 memory I have enumerated scarcely any of even the principal
 objects The visitors to the Palace average 6000 dailydouble the
 population of Hannibal The price of admission being fifty cents
 they take in about 3000

 The Latting Observatory height about 280 feet is near the Palace
 From it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country
 around The Croton Aqueduct to supply the city with water is the
 greatest wonder yet Immense pipes are laid across the bed of the
 Harlem River and pass through the country to Westchester County
 where a whole river is turned from its course and brought to New
 York From the reservoir in the city to Westchester County
 reservoir the distance is thirtyeight miles and if necessary
 they could easily supply every family in New York with one hundred
 barrels of water a day

 I am very sorry to learn that Henry has been sick He ought to go
 to the country and take exercise for he is not half so healthy as
 Ma thinks he is If he had my walking to do he would be another
 boy entirely Four times every day I walk a little over a mile and
 working hard all day and walking four miles is exercise I am used
 to it now though and it is no trouble Where is it Orions going
 to Tell Ma my promises are faithfully kept and if I have my
 health I will take her to Ky in the spring I shall save money for
 this

 It has just struck 2 AM and I always get up at six and am at
 work at 7 You ask where I spend my evenings Where would you
 suppose with a free printers library containing more than 4000
 volumes within a quarter of a mile of me and nobody at home to talk
 to

 I shall write to Ella soon Write soon
 Truly your Brother

 SAMY

 PSI have written this by a light so dim that you nor Ma could
 not read by it

We get a fair idea of Samuel Clemens at seventeen from this letter For
one thing he could write good clear English full of interesting facts
He is enthusiastic but not lavish of words He impresses us with his
statement that the visitors to the Palace each day are in number double
the population of Hannibal a whole river is turned from its course to
supply New York City with water the water comes thirtyeight miles and
each family could use a hundred barrels a day The letter reveals his
personal sidehis kindly interest in those left behind his anxiety for
Henry his assurance that the promise to his mother was being kept his
memory of her longing to visit her old home And the boy who hated
school has become a readerhe is reveling in a printers library of
thousands of volumes We feel somehow that Samuel Clemens has suddenly
become quite a seriousminded person that he has left Tom Sawyer and Joe
Harper and Huck Finn somewhere in a beautiful country a long way behind

He found work with the firm of John A Gray  Green general printers in
Cliff Street His pay was four dollars a week in wildcat moneythat
is money issued by private banksrather poor money being generally at
a discount and sometimes worth less But if wages were low living
was cheap in those days and Sam Clemens lodging in a mechanics
boardinghouse in Duane Street sometimes had fifty cents left on
Saturday night when his board and washing were paid

Luckily he had not set out to seek his fortune but only to see
something of the world He lingered in New York through the summer of
1853 never expecting to remain long His letters of that period were
few In October he said in a letter to Pamela that he did not write to
the family because he did not know their whereabouts Orion having sold
the paper and left Hannibal

 I have been fooling myself with the idea that I was going to leave
 New York every day for the last two weeks he adds which sounds
 like the Mark Twain of fifty years later Farther along he tells
 of going to see Edwin Forrest then playing at the Broadway Theater

 The play was the Gladiator I did not like part of it much but
 other portions were really splendid In the latter part of the last
 act   the mans whole soul seems absorbed in the part he is
 playing and it is real startling to see him I am sorry I did not
 see him play Damon and Pythias the former character being the
 greatest He appears in Philadelphia on Monday night

A little farther along he says

 If my letters do not come often you need not bother yourself about
 me for if you have a brother nearly eighteen years old who is not
 able to take care of himself a few miles from home such a brother
 is not worth ones thoughts

Sam Clemens may have followed Forrest to Philadelphia At any rate he
was there presently subbing in the composingrooms of the Inquirer
setting ten thousand ems a day and receiving pay accordingly When
there was no vacancy for him to fill he put in the time visiting the
Philadelphia libraries art galleries and historic landmarks After
all his chief business was sightseeing Work was only a means to this
end Chilly evenings when he returned to his boardinghouse his
roommate an Englishman named Sumner grilled a herring over their small
open fire and this was a great feast He tried writingobituary poetry
for the Philadelphia Ledgerbut it was not accepted

My efforts were not received with approval was his comment long after

In the Inquirer office there was a printer named Frog and sometimes
when he went out the office devils would hang over his case a line
with a hook on it baited with a piece of red flannel They never got
tired of this joke and Frog never failed to get fighting mad when he saw
that dangling string with the bit of red flannel at the end No doubt
Sam Clemens had his share in this mischief

Sam found that he liked Philadelphia He could save a little money and
send something to his mothersmall amounts but welcome Once he
inclosed a gold dollar to serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we
are paid with in Philadelphia Better than doubtful wildcat
certainly Of his work he writes

 One man has engaged me to work for him every Sunday till the first
 of next April when I shall return home to take Ma to Ky    
 If I want to I can get subbing every night of the week I go to
 work at seven in the evening and work till three the next morning
    The type is mostly agate and minion with some bourgeois
 and when one gets a good agate take he is sure to make money I
 made 250 last Sunday

There is a long description of a trip on the Fairmount stage in this
letter wellwritten and interesting but too long to have place here
In the same letter he speaks of the graves of Benjamin Franklin and his
wife which he had looked at through the iron railing of the locked
inclosure Probably it did not occur to him that there might be points
of similarity between Franklins career and his own Yet in time these
would be rather striking each learned the printers trade each worked
in his brothers office and wrote for the paper each left quietly and
went to New York and from New York to Philadelphia as a journeyman
printer each in due season became a world figure manysided human and
of incredible popularity

Orion Clemens meantime had bought a paper in Muscatine Iowa and
located the family there Evidently by this time he had realized the
value of his brother as a contributor for Sam in a letter to Orion
says I will try to write for the paper occasionally but I fear my
letters will be very uninteresting for this incessant night work dulls
ones ideas amazingly

Meantime he had passed his eighteenth birthday winter was coming on he
had been away from home half a year and the first attack of homesickness
was due One only has to leave home to learn how to write interesting
letters to an absent friend he wrote and again I dont like our
present prospect for cold weather at all

He declared he only wanted to get back to avoid night work which was
injuring his eyes but we may guess there was a stronger reason which
perhaps he did not entirely realize The novelty of wandering had worn
off and he yearned for familiar faces the comfort of those he loved

But he did not go He made a trip to Washington in Januarya
sightseeing tripreturning to Philadelphia where he worked for the
Ledger and North American Eventually he went back to New York and
from there took ticket to St Louis This was in the late summer of 1854
he had been fifteen months away from his people when he stepped aboard
the train to return

Sam was worn out when he reached St Louis but the Keokuk packet was
leaving and he stopped only long enough to see Pamela then went aboard
and flinging himself into his berth did not waken until the boat
reached Muscatine Iowa thirtysix hours later

It was very early when he arrived too early to rouse the family He sat
down in the office of a little hotel to wait for morning and picked up a
small book that lay on the writingtable It contained pictures of the
English rulers with the brief facts of their reigns Sam Clemens
entertained himself learning these data by heart He had a fine memory
for such things and in an hour or two had those details so perfectly
committed that he never forgot one of them as long as he lived The
knowledge acquired in this stray fashion he found invaluable in later
life It was his groundwork for all English history




X

A WIND OF CHANCE

Orion could not persuade his brother to remain in Muscatine Sam
returned to his old place on the Evening News in St Louis where he
remained until the following year rooming with a youth named Burrough a
journeyman chairmaker with literary taste a reader of the English
classics a companionable lad and for Samuel Clemens a good influence

By spring Orion Clemens had married and had sold out in Muscatine He
was now located in Keokuk Iowa When presently Brother Sam came
visiting to Keokuk Orion offered him five dollars a week and his board
to remain He accepted Henry Clemens now seventeen was also in
Orions employ and a lad named Dick Hingham Henry and Sam slept in the
office Dick and a young fellow named Brownell who roomed above came in
for social evenings

They were pretty lively evenings A musicteacher on the floor below did
not care for themthey disturbed his class He was furious in fact
and assailed the boys roughly at first with no result but to make
matters worse Then he tried gentleness and succeeded The boys
stopped their capers and joined his class Sam especially became a
distinguished member of that body He was never a great musician but
with his good nature his humor his slow quaint speech and originality
he had no rival in popularity He was twenty now and much with young
ladies yet he was always a beau rather than a suitor a good comrade to
all full of pranks and pleasantries ready to stop and be merry with any
that came along If they prophesied concerning his future it is not
likely that they spoke of literary fame They thought him just
easygoing and lightminded True they noticed that he often carried a
book under his arma history a volume of Dickens or the tales of Poe

He read more than any one guessed At night propped up in beda habit
continued until his deathhe was likely to read until a late hour He
enjoyed smoking at such times and had made himself a pipe with a large
bowl which stood on the floor and had a long rubber stem something like
the Turkish hubblebubble He liked to fill the big bowl and smoke at
ease through the entire evening But sometimes the pipe went out which
meant that he must strike a match and lean far over to apply it just
when he was most comfortable Sam Clemens never liked unnecessary
exertion One night when the pipe had gone out for the second time he
happened to hear the young bookclerk Brownell passing up to his room
on the top floor Sam called to him

Ed come here

Brownell poked his head in the door The two were great chums

What will you have Sam he asked

Come in Ed Henrys asleep and Im in trouble I want somebody to
light my pipe

Why dont you light it yourself Brownell asked

I would only I knew youd be along in a few minutes and would do it for
me

Brownell scratched a match stooped down and applied it

What are you reading Sam

Oh nothing mucha socalled funny book One of these days Ill write
a funnier book myself

Brownell laughed No you wont Sam he said Youre too lazy ever
to write a book

Years later in the course of a lecture which he delivered in Keokuk
Mark Twain said that he supposed the most untruthful man in the world
lived right there in Keokuk and that his name was Ed Brownell

Orion Clemens did not have the gift of prosperity and his
printingoffice did not flourish When he could no longer pay Sams wages
he took him into partnership which meant that Sam got no wages at all
though this was of less consequence since his mother now living with
Pamela was well provided for The disorder of the office however
distressed him He wrote home that he could not work without system and
a little later that he was going to leave Keokuk that in fact he was
planning a great adventurea trip to the upper Amazon

His interest in the Amazon had been awakened by a book Lynch and
Herndon had surveyed the upper river and Lieutenant Herndons book was
widely read Sam Clemens propped up in bed pored over it through long
evenings and nightly made fabulous fortunes collecting cocoa and other
rare thingsresolving meantime to start in person for the upper Amazon
with no unnecessary delay Boy and man Samuel Clemens was the same
His vision of grand possibilities ahead blinded him to the ways and means
of arrival It was an inheritance from both sides of his parentage
Once in old age he wrote

 I have been punished many and many a time and bitterly for doing
 things and reflecting afterward     When I am reflecting on
 these occasions even deaf persons can hear me think

He believed however that he had reflected carefully concerning the
Amazon and that in a brief time he should be there at the head of an
expedition piling up untold wealth He even stirred the imaginations of
two other adventurers a Dr Martin and a young man named Ward To
Henry then in St Louis he wrote August 5 1856

 Ward and I held a long consultation Sunday morning and the result
 was that we two have determined to start to Brazil if possible in
 six weeks from now in order to look carefully into matters there
 and report to Dr Martin in time for him to follow on the first of
 March

The matter of finance troubled him Orion could not be depended on for
any specified sum and the fare to the upper Amazon would probably be
considerable Sam planned different methods of raising it One of them
was to go to New York or Cincinnati and work at his trade until he saved
the amount He would then sail from New York direct or take boat for
New Orleans and sail from there Of course there would always be vessels
clearing for the upper Amazon After Lieutenant Herndons book the ocean
would probably be full of them

He did not make the start with Ward as planned and Ward and Martin seem
to have given up the Amazon idea Not so with Samuel Clemens He went
on reading Herndon trying meantime to raise money enough to get him out
of Keokuk Was it fate or Providence that suddenly placed it in his
hands Whatever it was the circumstance is so curious that it must be
classed as one of those strange facts that have no place in fiction

The reader will remember how one day in Hannibal the wind had brought
to Sam Clemens then printers apprentice a stray leaf from a book about
Joan of Arc and how that incident marked a turningpoint in his mental
life Now seven years later it was the wind again that directed his
fortune It was a day in early Novemberbleak bitter and
gusty with whirling snow most persons were indoors Samuel Clemens
going down Main Street Keokuk saw a flying bit of paper pass him and
lodge against a building Something about it attracted him and he
captured it It was a fiftydollar bill He had never seen one before
but he recognized it He thought he must be having a pleasant dream

He was tempted to pocket his good fortune and keep still But he had
always a troublesome conscience He went to a newspaper office and
advertised that he had found a sum of money a large bill

Once long after he said I didnt describe it very particularly and I
waited in daily fear that the owner would turn up and take away my
fortune By and by I couldnt stand it any longer My conscience had
gotten all that was coming to it I felt that I must take that money out
of danger

Another time he said I advertised the find and left for the Amazon the
same day All of which we may take with his usual literary discount
the one assigned to him by his mother in childhood As a matter of fact
he remained for an ample time and nobody came for the money What was
its origin Was it swept out of a bank or caught up by the wind from
some countingroom table Perhaps it materialized out of the unseen
Who knows




XI

THE LONG WAY TO THE AMAZON

Sam decided on Cincinnati as his base From there he could go either to
New York or New Orleans to catch the Amazon boat He paid a visit to St
Louis where his mother made him renew his promise as to drink and cards
Then he was seized with a literary idea and returned to Keokuk where he
proposed to a thriving weekly paper the Saturday Post to send letters
of travel which might even be made into a book later on George Reese
owner of the Post agreed to pay five dollars each for the letters
which speaks well for his faith in Samuel Clemenss talent five dollars
being good pay for that time and placemore than the letters were worth
judged by present standards The first was dated Cincinnati November
14 1856 and was certainly not promising literature It was written in
the ridiculous dialect which was once thought to be the dress of humor
and while here and there is a comic flash there is in it little promise
of the future Mark Twain One extract is enough

 When we got to the depo I went around to git a look at the iron
 hoss Thunderation It wasnt no more like a hoss than a meetin
 house If I was goin to describe the animule Id say it looked
 likewell it looked likeblamed if I know what it looked like
 snorting fire and brimstone out of his nostrils and puffin out
 black smoke all round and pantin and heavin and swellin and
 chawin up redhot coals like they was good A feller stood in a
 little house like feedin him all the time but the more he got
 the more he wanted and the more he blowed and snorted After a
 spell the feller ketched him by the tail and great Jericho he set
 up a yell that split the ground for moren a mile and a half and
 the next minit I felt my legs awaggin and found myself at tother
 end of the string o vehickles I wasnt skeered but I had three
 chills and a stroke of palsy in less than five minits and my face
 had a curus brownishyallergreenbluish color in it which was
 perfectly unaccountable Well say I comment is superfluous

How Samuel Clemens could have written that and worse at twentyone and
a little more than ten years later have written The Innocents Abroad
is one of the mysteries of literature The letters were signed
Snodgrass and there are but two of them Snodgrass seems to have
found them hard work for it is said he raised on the price which
fortunately brought the series to a close Their value today lies in
the fact that they are the earliest of Mark Twains newspaper
contributions that have been preservedthe first for which he received a
cash return

Sam remained in Cincinnati until April of the following year 1857
working for Wrightson  Co general printers lodging in a cheap
boardinghouse saving every possible penny for his great adventure

He had one associate at the boardinghouse a lank unsmiling Scotchman
named Macfarlane twice young Clemenss age and a good deal of a
mystery Sam never could find out what Macfarlane did His hands were
hardened by some sort of heavy labor he left at six in the morning and
returned in the evening at the same hour He never mentioned his work
and young Clemens had the delicacy not to inquire

For Macfarlane was no ordinary person He was a man of deep knowledge a
reader of many books a thinker he was versed in history and philosophy
he knew the dictionary by heart He made but two statements concerning
himself one that he had acquired his knowledge from reading and not at
school the other that he knew every word in the English dictionary He
was willing to give proof of the last and Sam Clemens tested him more
than once but found no word that Macfarlane could not define

Macfarlane was not silenthe would discuss readily enough the deeper
problems of life and had many startling theories of his own Darwin had
not yet published his Descent of Man yet Macfarlane was already
advancing ideas similar to those in that book He went further than
Darwin He had startling ideas of the moral evolution of man and these
he would pour into the ears of his young listener until ten oclock
after which like the English Sumner in Philadelphia he would grill a
herring and the evening would end Those were fermenting discourses
that young Samuel Clemens listened to that winter in Macfarlanes room
and they did not fail to influence his later thought

It was the hightide of spring late in April when the prospective
cocoahunter decided that it was time to set out for the upper Amazon
He had saved money enough to carry him at least as far as New Orleans
where he would take ship it being farther south and therefore nearer his
destination Furthermore he could begin with a lazy trip down the
Mississippi which next to being a pilot had been one of his most
cherished dreams The Ohio River steamers were less grand than those of
the Mississippi but they had a homelike atmosphere and did not hurry
Samuel Clemens had the spring fever and was willing to take his time

In Life on the Mississippi we read that the author ran away vowing
never to return until he could come home a pilot shedding glory But
this is the fiction touch He had always loved the river and his
boyhood dream of piloting had time and again returned but it was not
uppermost when he bade goodby to Macfarlane and stepped aboard the Paul
Jones bound for New Orleans and thus conferred immortality on that
ancient little craft

Now he had really started on his voyage But it was a voyage that would
continue not for a week or a fortnight but for four yearsfour
marvelous sunlit years the glory of which would color all that followed
them




XII

RENEWING AN OLD AMBITION

A reader of Mark Twains Mississippi book gets the impression that the
author was a boy of about seventeen when he started to learn the river
and that he was painfully ignorant of the great task ahead But this
also is the fiction side of the story Samuel Clemens was more than
twentyone when he set out on the Paul Jones and in a way was familiar
with the trade of piloting Hannibal had turned out many pilots An
older brother of the Bowen boys was already on the river when Sam Clemens
was rolling rocks down Hollidays Hill Often he came home to air his
grandeur and hold forth on the wonder of his work That learning the
river was no light task Sam Clemens would know as well as any one who had
not tried it

Nevertheless as the drowsy little steamer went puffing down into softer
sunnier lands the old dream the permanent ambition of boyhood
returned while the call of the faroff Amazon and cocoa drew faint

Horace Bixby2 pilot of the Paul Jones a man of thirtytwo was
looking out over the bow at the head of Island No 35 when he heard a
slow pleasant voice say Good morning

Bixby was a small cleancut man Good morning sir he said rather
briskly without looking around

He did not much care for visitors in the pilothouse This one entered
and stood a little behind him

How would you like a young man to learn the river came to him in that
serene deliberate speech

The pilot glanced over his shoulder and saw a rather slender
looselimbed youth with a fair girlish complexion and a great mass
of curly auburn hair

I wouldnt like it Cub pilots are more trouble than theyre worth A
great deal more trouble than profit

I am a printer by trade the easy voice went on It doesnt agree
with me I thought Id go to South America

Bixby kept his eye on the river but there was interest in his voice when
he spoke What makes you pull your words that way he askedpulling
being the river term for drawling

The young man now seated comfortably on the visitors bench said more
slowly than ever Youll have to ask my mothershe pulls hers too

Pilot Bixby laughed The manner of the reply amused him His guest was
encouraged

Do you know the Bowen boys he asked pilots in the St Louis and New
Orleans trade

I know them wellall three of them William Bowen did his first
steering for me a mighty good boy I know Sam too and Bart

Old schoolmates of mine in Hannibal Sam and Will especially were my
chums

Bixbys tone became friendly Come over and stand by me he said
What is your name

The applicant told him and the two stood looking out on the sunlit
water

Do you drink

No

Do you gamble

No sir

Do you swear

Nnot for amusement only under pressure

Do you chew

No sir never but I mustsmoke

Did you ever do any steering

I have steered everything on the river but a steamboat I guess

Very well Take the wheel and see what you can do with a steamboat
Keep her as she istoward that lower cottonwood snag

Bixby had a sore foot and was glad of a little relief He sat on the
bench where he could keep a careful eye on the course By and by he said
There is just one way I would take a young man to learn the riverthat
is for money

Whatdo youcharge

Five hundred dollars and I to be at no expense whatever

In those days pilots were allowed to carry a learner or cub board
free Mr Bixby meant that he was to be at no expense in port or for
incidentals His terms seemed discouraging

I havent got five hundred dollars in money Sam said Ive got a lot
of Tennessee land worth two bits an acre Ill give you two thousand
acres of that

Bixby shook his head No he said I dont want any unimproved real
estate I have too much already

Sam reflected He thought he might be able to borrow one hundred dollars
from William Moffett Pamelas husband without straining his credit

Well then he proposed Ill give you one hundred dollars cash and
the rest when I earn it

Something about this young man had won Horace Bixbys heart His slow
pleasant speech his unhurried quiet manner at the wheel his evident
simplicity and sinceritythe inner qualities of mind and heart which
would make the world love Mark Twain The terms proposed were accepted
The first payment was to be in cash the others were to begin when the
pupil had learned the river and was earning wages During the rest of
the trip to New Orleans the new pupil was often at the wheel while Mr
Bixby nursed his sore foot and gave directions Any literary ambitions
that Samuel Clemens still nourished waned rapidly By the time he had
reached New Orleans he had almost forgotten he had ever been a printer
As for the Amazon and cocoa why there had been no ship sailing in that
direction for years and it was unlikely that any would ever sail again
a fact that rather amused the wouldbe adventurer now since Providence
had regulated his affairs in accordance with his oldest and longest
cherished dream

At New Orleans Bixby left the Paul Jones for a fine St Louis boat
taking his cub with him This was a sudden and happy change and Sam was
a good deal impressed with his own importance in belonging to so imposing
a structure especially when after a few days stay in New Orleans he
stood by Bixbys side in the big glass turret while they backed out of
the line of wedgedin boats and headed up the great river

This was glory but there was sorrow ahead He had not really begun
learning the river as yet he had only steered under directions He had
known that to learn the river would be hard but he had never realized
quite how hard Serenely he had undertaken the task of mastering twelve
hundred miles of the great changing shifting river as exactly and as
surely by daylight or darkness as one knows the way to his own features
Nobody could realize the full size of that tasknot till afterward

2 Horace Bixby lived until 1912 and remained at the wheel until within
a short time of his death in his eightyseventh year The writer of
this memoir visited him in 1910 and took down from his dictation the
dialogue that follows



XIII

LEARNING THE RIVER

In that early day to be a pilot was to be greater than a king The
Mississippi River pilot was a law unto himselfthere was none above him
His direction of the boat was absolute he could start or lay up when he
chose he could pass a landing regardless of business there consulting
nobody not even the captain he could take the boat into what seemed
certain destruction if he had that mind and the captain was obliged to
stand by helpless and silent for the law was with the pilot in
everything

Furthermore the pilot was a gentleman His work was clean and
physically light It ended the instant the boat was tied to the landing
and did not begin again until it was ready to back into the stream
Also for those days his salary was princelythe VicePresident of the
United States did not receive more As for prestige the Mississippi
pilot perched high in his glass inclosure fashionably dressed and
commanding all below him was the most conspicuous and showy the most
observed and envied creature in the world No wonder Sam Clemens with
his love of the river and his boyish fondness for honors should aspire
to that stately rank Even at twentyone he was still just a boyas
indeed he was till his deathand we may imagine how elated he was
starting up the great river as a real apprentice pilot who in a year or
two would stand at the wheel as his chief was now standing a monarch
with a splendid income and all the great river packed away in his head

In that last item lay the trouble In the Mississippi book he tells of
it in a way that no one may hope to equal and if the details are not
exact the truth is thereat least in substance

For a distance above New Orleans Mr Bixby had volunteered information
about the river naming the points and crossings in what seemed a casual
way all through his watch of four hours Their next watch began in the
middle of the night and Mark Twain tells how surprised and disgusted he
was to learn that pilots must get up in the night to run their boats and
his amazement to find Mr Bixby plunging into the blackness ahead as if
it had been daylight Very likely this is mainly fiction but hardly the
following

 Presently he turned to me and said Whats the name of the first
 point above New Orleans

 I was gratified to be able to answer promptly and I did I said I
 didnt know

 Dont know

 His manner jolted me I was down at the foot again in a moment
 But I had to say just what I had said before

 Well youre a smart one said Mr Bixby Whats the name of the
 next point

 Once more I didnt know

 Well this beats anything Tell me the name of any point or place
 I told you

 I studied awhile and decided that I couldnt

 Look here What do you start from above Twelve Mile Point to
 cross over

 IIdont know

 Youyou dont know mimicking my drawling manner of speech
 What do you know

 IINothing for certain

 Bixby was a small nervous man hot and quickfiring He went off
 now and said a number of severe things Then

 Look here what do you suppose I told you the names of those points
 for

 I tremblingly considered a momentthen the devil of temptation
 provoked me to say Welltotobe entertaining I thought

 This was a red flag to the bull He raged and stormed so he was
 crossing the river at the time that I judged it made him blind
 because he ran over the steeringoar of a tradingscow Of course
 the traders sent up a volley of redhot profanity Never was a man
 so grateful as Mr Bixby was because he was brimful and here were
 subjects who would talk back He threw open a window thrust his
 head out and such an irruption followed as I had never heard before
     When he closed the window he was empty Presently he
 said to me in the gentlest way

 My boy you must get a little memorandumbook and every time I
 tell you a thing put it down right away Theres only one way to
 be a pilot and that is to get this entire river by heart You have
 to know it just like ABC

The little memorandumbook which Sam Clemens bought probably at the next
daylight landing still existsthe same that he says fairly bristled
with the names of towns points bars islands bends reaches etc
but it made his heart ache to think he had only half the river set down
for as the watches were four hours off and four hours on there were the
long gaps where he had slept

It is not easy to make out the penciled notes today The small neat
writing is faded and many of them are in an abbreviation made only for
himself It is hard even to find these examples to quote

MERIWETHERS BEND

Onefourth less 33run shape of upper bar and go into the low place in
the willows about 200 ft lower down than last year

OUTSIDE OF MONTEZUMA

Six or eight feet more water Shape bar till high timber on towhead gets
nearly even with low willows Then hold a little open on right of low
willowsrun em close if you want to but come out 200 yards when you
get nearly to head of towhead

The average mind would not hold a single one of these notes ten seconds
yet by the time he reached St Louis he had set down pages that today
make ones head weary even to contemplate And those long fourhour gaps
where he had been asleepthey are still there and now after nearly
sixty years the old heartache is still in them He must have bought a
new book for the next trip and laid this one away

To the new cub it seemed a long way to St Louis that first trip but
in the end it was rather grand to come steaming up to the big busy city
with its thronging waterfront flanked with a solid mile of steamboats
and to nose ones way to a place in that stately line

At St Louis Sam borrowed from his brotherinlaw the one hundred
dollars he had agreed to pay and so closed his contract with Bixby A
few days later his chief was engaged to go on a very grand boat indeeda
sumptuous temple he tells us all brass and inlay with a pilothouse
so far above the water that he seemed perched on a mountain This part
of learning the river was worth while and when he found that the
regiment of natty servants respectfully sird him his happiness was
complete

But he was in the depths again presently for when they started down the
river and he began to take account of his knowledge he found that he had
none Everything had changedthat is he was seeing it all from the
other direction What with the fourhour gaps and this transformation
he was lost completely

How could the easygoing dreamy unpractical man whom the world knew as
Mark Twain ever have persisted against discouragement like that to
acquire the vast the absolute limitless store of information necessary
to Mississippi piloting The answer is that he loved the river the
picturesqueness and poetry of a steamboat the ease and glory of a
pilots life and then in spite of his own later claims to the contrary
Samuel Clemens boy and man in the work suited to his tastes and gifts
was the most industrious of persons Work of the other sort he avoided
overlooked refused to recognize but never any labor for which he was
qualified by his talents or training Piloting suited him exactly and
he proved an apt pupil

Horace Bixby said to the writer of this memoir Sam was always
goodnatured and he had a natural taste for the river He had a fine
memory and never forgot what I told him

Yet there must have been hard places all along for to learn every crook
and turn and stump and snag and bluff and bar and sounding of that twelve
hundred miles of mighty shifting water was a gigantic task Mark Twain
tells us how when he was getting along pretty well his chief one day
turned on him suddenly with this settler

 What is the shape of Walnut Bend

 He might as well have asked me my grandmothers opinion of
 protoplasm I replied respectfully and said I didnt know it had
 any particular shape My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang of
 course and then went on loading and firing until he was out of
 adjectives I waited By and by he said

 My boy youve got to know the shape of the river perfectly It is
 all that is left to steer by on a very dark night Everything else
 is blotted out and gone But mind you it hasnt got the same shape
 in the night that it has in the daytime

 How on earth am I going to learn it then

 How do you follow a hall at home in the dark Because you know the
 shape of it You cant see it

 Do you mean to say that Ive got to know all the million trifling
 variations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well
 as I know the shape of the front hall at home

 On my honor youve got to know them better than any man ever did
 know the shapes of the halls in his own house

 I wish I was dead

But the reader must turn to Chapter VIII of Life on the Mississippi and
read or reread the pages which follow this extractnothing can better
convey the difficulties of piloting That Samuel Clemens had the courage
to continue is the best proof not only of his great love of the river
but of that splendid gift of resolution that one rarely fails to find in
men of the foremost rank

RIVER DAYS

Piloting was only a part of Sam Clemenss education on the Mississippi
He learned as much of the reefs and shallows of human nature as of the
riverbed In one place he writes

 In that brief sharp schooling I got personally and familiarly
 acquainted with all the different types of human nature that are to
 be found in fiction biography or history

All the different types but most of them in the rough That Samuel
Clemens kept the promise made to his mother as to drink and cards during
those apprentice days is well worth remembering

Horace Bixby answering a call for pilots from the Missouri River
consigned his pupil as was customary tonne of the pilots of the John
J Roe a freightboat owned and conducted by some retired farmers and
in its hospitality reminding Sam of his Uncle John Quarless farm The
Roe was a very deliberate boat It was said that she could beat an
island to St Louis but never quite overtake the current going
downstream Sam loved the Roe She was not licensed to carry
passengers but she always had a family party of the owners relations
aboard and there was a big deck for dancing and a piano in the cabin
The young pilot could play the chords and sing in his own fashion
about a grasshopper that sat on a sweetpotato vine and about

 An old old horse whose name was Methusalem
 Took him down and sold him in Jerusalem
 A long time ago

The Roe was a heavenly place but Sams stay there did not last Bixby
came down from the Missouri and perhaps thought he was doing a fine
thing for his pupil by transferring him to a pilot named Brown then on a
large passengersteamer the Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania was new
and one of the finest boats on the river Sam Clemens by this time was
accounted a good steersman so it seemed fortunate and a good arrangement
for all parties

But Brown was a tyrant He was illiterate and coarse and took a dislike
to Sam from the start His first greeting was a question harmless
enough in form but offensive in manner

Are you Horace Bigsbys cubBixby being usually pronounced Bigsby
in river parlance

Sam answered politely enough that he was and Brown proceeded to comment
on the style of his clothes and other personal matters

He had made an effort to please Brown but it was no use Brown was
never satisfied At a moment when Sam was steering Brown sitting on
the bench would shout Here Where are you going now Pull her down
Pull her down Do you hear me Blamed mudcat

The young pilot soon learned to detest his chief and presently was
putting in a good deal of his time inventing punishments for him

I could imagine myself killing Brown there was no law against that and
that was the thing I always used to do the moment I was abed Instead of
going over the river in my mind as was my duty I threw business aside
for pleasure and killed Brown

He gave up trying to please Brown and was even willing to stir him up
upon occasion One day when the cub was at the wheel his chief noticed
that the course seemed peculiar

Here Where you headin for now he yelled What in the nation you
steerin at anyway Blamed numskull

Why said Sam in his calm slow way I didnt see much else I could
steer for so I was heading for that white heifer on the bank

Get away from that wheel And get outen this pilothouse yelled
Brown You aint fitten to become no pilot An order that Sam found
welcome enough The other pilot George Ealer was a lovable soul who
played the flute and chess during his off watch and read aloud to Sam
from Goldsmith and Shakespeare To be with George Ealer was to
forget the persecutions of Brown

Young Clemens had been on the river nearly a year at this time and
though he had learned a good deal and was really a fine steersman he
received no wages He had no board to pay but there were things he must
buy and his money supply had become limited Each trip of the
Pennsylvania she remained about two days and nights in New Orleans
during which time the young man was free He found he could earn two and
a half to three dollars a night watching freight on the levee and as
this opportunity came around about once a month the amount was useful
Nor was this the only return many years afterward he said

 It was a desolate experience watching there in the dark among
 those piles of freight not a sound not a living creature astir
 But it was not a profitless one I used to have inspirations as I
 sat there alone those nights I used to imagine all sots of
 situations and possibilities These things got into my books by and
 by and furnished me with many a chapter I can trace the effects
 of those nights through most of my books in one way and another

Piloting even with Brown had its pleasant side In St Louis young
Clemens stopped with his sister and often friends were there from
Hannibal At both ends of the line he visited friendly boats especially
the Roe where a grand welcome was always waiting Once among the
guests of that boat a young girl named Laura so attracted him that he
forgot time and space until one of the Roe pilots Zeb Leavenworth
came flying aft shouting

The Pennsylvania is backing out

A hasty goodby a wild flight across the decks of several boats and a
leap across several feet of open water closed the episode He wrote to
Laura but there was no reply He never saw her again never heard from
her for nearly fifty years when both were widowed and old She had not
received his letter

Occasionally there were stirring adventures aboard the Pennsylvania
In a letter written in March 1858 the young pilot tells of an exciting
night search in the running ice for Hat Island soundings

Brown the pilot stood in the bow with an oar to keep her head out and
I took the tiller We would start the men and all would go well until
the yawl would bring us on a heavy cake of ice and then the men would
drop like so many tenpins while Brown assumed the horizontal in the
bottom of the boat After an hours hard work we got back with ice half
an inch thick on the oars     The next day was colder still I
was out in the yawl twice and then we got through but the infernal
steamboat came near running over us     The Maria Denning was
aground at the head of the island they hailed us we ran alongside and
they hoisted us in and thawed us out We had been out in the yawl from
four in the morning until halfpast nine without being near a fire
There was a thick coating of ice over men and yawl ropes and
everything and we looked like rockcandy statuary

He was at the right age to enjoy such adventures and to feel a pride in
them In the same letter he tells how he found on the Pennsylvania a
small clerkship for his brother Henry who was now nearly twenty a
handsome gentle boy of whom Sam was lavishly fond and proud The young
pilot was eager to have Henry with himto see him started in life How
little he dreamed what sorrow would come of his wellmeant efforts in the
lads behalf Yet he always believed later that he had a warning for
one night at the end of May in St Louis he had a vivid dream which
time would presently fulfil

An incident now occurred on the Pennsylvania that closed Samuel
Clemenss career on that boat It was the down trip and the boat was in
Eagle Bend when Henry Clemens appeared on the hurricane deck with an
announcement from the captain of a landing a little lower down Brown
who would never own that he was rather deaf probably misunderstood the
order They were passing the landing when the captain appeared on the
deck

Didnt Henry tell you to land here he called to Brown

No sir

Captain Klinefelter turned to Sam Didnt you hear him

Yes sir

Brown said Shut your mouth You never heard anything of the kind

Henry appeared not suspecting any trouble

Brown said fiercely Here why didnt you tell me we had got to land at
that plantation

I did tell you Mr Brown Henry said politely

Its a lie

Sam Clemens could stand Browns abuse of himself but not of Henry He
said You lie yourself He did tell you

For a cub pilot to defy his chief was unheard of Brown was dazed then
he shouted

Ill attend to your case in half a minute And to Henry Get out of
here

Henry had started when Brown seized him by the collar and struck him in
the face An instant later Sam was upon Brown with a heavy stool and
stretched him on the floor Then all the repressed fury of months broke
loose and leaping upon Brown and holding him down with his knees
Samuel Clemens pounded the tyrant with his fists till his strength gave
out He let Brown go then and the latter with pilot instinct sprang
to the wheel for the boat was drifting Seeing she was safe he seized
a spyglass as a weapon and ordered his chastiser out of the pilothouse
But Sam lingered He had become very calm and he openly corrected
Browns English

Dont give me none of your airs yelled Brown I aint goin to stand
nothin more from you

You should say Dont give me any of your airs Sam said sweetly
and the last half of your sentence almost defies correction

A group of passengers and whiteaproned servants assembled on the deck
forward applauded the victor Sam went down to find Captain
Klinefelter He expected to be put in irons for it was thought to be
mutiny to strike a pilot

The captain took Sam into his private room and made some inquiries Mark
Twain in the Mississippi boot remembers them as follows

Did you strike him first Captain Klinefelter asked

Yes sir

What with

A stool sir

Hard

Middling sir

Did it knock him down

Hehe fell sir

Did you follow it up Did you do anything further

Yes sir

What did you do

Pounded him sir

Pounded him

Yes sir

Did you pound him muchthat is severely

One might call it that sir maybe

I am mighty glad of it Hark yenever mention that I said that You
have been guilty of a great crime and dont ever be guilty of it again
on this boat butlay for him ashore Give him a good sound thrashing
do you hear Ill pay the expenses

In a letter which Samuel Clemens wrote to Orions wife immediately after
this incident he gives the details of the encounter with Brown and
speaks of Captain Klinefelters approval4 Brown declared he would
leave the boat at New Orleans if Sam Clemens remained on it and the
captain told him to go offering to let Sam himself run the daylight
watches back to St Louis thus showing his faith in the young steersman
The cub however had less confidence and advised that Brown be kept
for the up trip saying he would follow by the next boat It was a
decision that probably saved his life

That night watching on the levee Henry joined him when his own duties
were finished and the brothers made the round together It may have
been some memory of his dream that made Samuel Clemens say

Henry in case of accident whatever you do dont lose your headthe
passengers will do that Rush for the hurricanedeck and to the
lifeboat and obey the mates orders When the boat is launched help
the women and children into it Dont get in yourself The river is only
a mile wide You can swim ashore easily enough

It was good manly advice but a long grief lay behind it

4 In the Mississippi book the author says that Brown was about to
strike Henry with a lump of coal but in the letter above mentioned the
details are as here given

THE WRECK OF THE PENNSYLVANIA

The A T Lacy that brought Samuel Clemens up the river was two days
behind the Pennsylvania At Greenville Mississippi a voice from
the landing shouted The Pennsylvania is blown up just below Memphis
at Ship Island One hundred and fifty lives lost

It proved a true report At six oclock that warm midJune morning
while loading wood sixty miles below Memphis four out of eight of the
Pennsylvanias boilers had suddenly exploded with fearful results
Henry Clemens had been one of the victims He had started to swim for
the shore only a few hundred yards away but had turned back to assist
in the rescue of others What followed could not be clearly learned He
was terribly injured and died on the fourth night after the catastrophe
His brother was with him by that time and believed he recognized the
exact fulfilment of his dream

The young pilots grief was very great In a letter home he spoke of the
dying boy as My darling my pride my glory my all His heavy sorrow
and the fact that with unsparing selfblame he held himself in a measure
responsible for his brothers tragic death saddened his early life His
early gaiety came back but his face had taken on the serious pathetic
look which from that time it always wore in repose Less than
twentythree he had suddenly the look of thirty and while Samuel
Clemens in spirit temperament and features never would become really
old neither would he ever look really young again

He returned to the river as steersman for George Ealer whom he loved
and in September of that year obtained a full license as Mississippi
River pilot from St Louis to New Orleans In eighteen months he had
packed away in his head all those wearisome details and acquired that
confidence that made him one of the elect He knew every snag and bank
and dead tree and depth in all those endless miles of shifting current
every cutoff and crossing He could read the surface of the water by
day he could smell danger in the dark To the writer of these chapters
Horace Bixby said

In a year and a half from the time he came to the river Sam was not
only a pilot but a good one Sam was a fine pilot and in a day when
piloting on the Mississippi required a great deal more brains and skill
and application than it does now There were no signallights along the
shore in those days and no searchlights on the vessels everything was
blind and on a dark misty night in a river full of snags and shifting
sandbars and changing shores a pilots judgment had to be founded on
absolute certainty

Bixby had returned from the Missouri by the time his pupils license was
issued and promptly took him as full partner on the Crescent City and
later on a fine new boat the New Falls City Still later they appear
to have been together on a very large boat the City of Memphis and
again on the Alonzo Child




XVI

THE PILOT

For Samuel Clemens these were happy daysthe happiest in some respects
he would ever know He had plenty of money now He could help his
mother with a liberal hand and could put away fully a hundred dollars a
month for himself He had few cares and he loved the ease and romance
and independence of his work as he would never quite love anything again

His popularity on the river was very great His humorous stories and
quaint speech made a crowd collect wherever he appeared There were
pilotassociation rooms in St Louis and New Orleans and his appearance
at one of these places was a signal for the members to gather

A friend of those days writes He was much given to spinning yarns so
funny that his hearers were convulsed and yet all the time his own face
was perfectly sober Occasionally some of his droll yarns got into the
papers He may have written them himself

Another old riverman remembers how one day at the association they
were talking of presence of mind in an accident when Pilot Clemens said

Boys I had great presence of mind once It was at a fire An old man
leaned out of a fourstory building calling for help Everybody in the
crowd below looked up but nobody did anything The ladders werent long
enough Nobody had any presence of mindnobody but me I came to the
rescue I yelled for a rope When it came I threw the old man the end
of it He caught it and I told him to tie it around his waist He did
so and I pulled him down

This was a story that found its way into print probably his own
contribution

Sam was always scribbling when not at the wheel said Bixby but the
best thing he ever did was the burlesque of old Isaiah Sellers He
didnt write it for print but only for his own amusement and to show to
a few of the boys Bart Bowen who was with him on the Edward J Gay
at the time got hold of it and gave it to one of the New Orleans
papers

The burlesque on Captain Sellers would be of little importance if it were
not for its association with the origin or at least with the
originator of what is probably the best known of literary namesthe
name Mark Twain

This strong happy titlea river term indicating a depth of two fathoms
on the soundinglinewas first used by the old pilot Isaiah Sellers
who was a sort of oldest inhabitant of the river with a passion for
airing his ancient knowledge before the younger men Sellers used to
send paragraphs to the papers quaint and rather egotistical in tone
usually beginning My opinion for the citizens of New Orleans etc
prophesying river conditions and recalling memories as far back as 1811
These he generally signed Mark Twain

Naturally the younger pilots amused themselves by imitating Sellers and
when Sam Clemens wrote abroad burlesque of the old mans contributions
relating a perfectly impossible trip supposed to have been made in 1763
with a Chinese captain and a Choctaw crew it was regarded as a
masterpiece of wit

It appeared in the True Delta in May 1859 and broke Captain Sellerss
literary heart He never wrote another paragraph Clemens always
regretted the whole matter deeply and his own revival of the name
afterward was a sort of tribute to the old man he had thoughtlessly and
unintentionally wounded

Old pilots of that day remembered Samuel Clemens as a slender
finelooking man well dressed even dandified generally wearing blue
serge with fancy shirts white duck trousers and patentleather shoes
A pilot could do that for his surroundings were speckless

The pilots regarded him as a great readera student of history travels
and the sciences In the association rooms they often saw him poring
over serious books He began the study of French one day in New Orleans
when he had passed a school of languages where French German and
Italian were taught one in each of three rooms The price was
twentyfive dollars for one language or three for fifty The student was
provided with a set of conversation cards for each and was supposed to
walk from one apartment to another changing his nationality at each
threshold The young pilot with his usual enthusiasm invested in all
three languages but after a few round trips decided that French would
do He did not return to the school but kept the cards and added
textbooks He studied faithfully when off watch and in port and his
old river notebook still preserved contains a number of advanced
exercises neatly written out

Still more interesting are the river notes themselves They are not the
timid hesitating memoranda of the little book which by Bixbys
advice he bought for his first trip They are quick vigorous records
that show confidence and knowledge Under the head of Second highwater
tripJan 1861 Alonzo Child the notes tell the story of a rising
river with overflowing banks blind passages and cutoffsa new river
in fact that must be judged by a perfect knowledge of the oldguessed
but guessed right

Good deal of water all over Coles Creek Chute 12 or 15 ft bankcould
have gone up above General Taylorstoo much drift    

Nightdidnt run either 77 or 76 towheads8ft bank on main shore
Ozark chute

To the reader today it means little enough but one may imagine
perhaps a milewide sweep of boiling water full of drift shifting
currents with newly forming bars and a lone figure in the dark
pilothouse peering into the night for blind and disappearing landmarks

But such nights were not all there was of piloting There were glorious
nights when the stars were blazing out and the moon was on the water
and the young pilot could follow a clear channel and dream long dreams
He was very serious at such timeshe reviewed the worlds history he had
read he speculated on the future he considered philosophies he lost
himself in a study of the stars Mark Twains love of astronomy which
never waned until his last day began with those lonely river watches
Once a great comet blazed in the sky a wonderful sheaf of light and
glorified his long hours at the wheel

Samuel Clemens was now twentyfive full of health and strong in his
courage In the old notebook there remains a wellworn clipping the
words of some unknown writer which he may have kept as a sort of creed

HOW TO TAKE LIFETake it just as though it wasas it isan earnest
vital and important affair Take it as though you were born to the task
of performing a merry part in itas though the world had awaited for
your coming Take it as though it was a grand opportunity to do and
achieve to carry forward great and good schemes to help and cheer a
suffering weary it may be heartbroken brother Now and then a man
stands aside from the crowd labors earnestly steadfastly confidently
and straightway becomes famous for wisdom intellect skill greatness of
some sort The world wonders admires idolizes and it only illustrates
what others may do if they take hold of life with a purpose The
miracle or the power that elevates the few is to be found in their
industry application and perseverance under the promptings of a brave
determined spirit

Bixby and Clemens were together that winter on the Child and were the
closest friends Once the young pilot invited his mother to make the
trip to New Orleans and the river journey and a long drive about the
beautiful Southern city filled Jane Clemens with wonder and delight She
no longer shad any doubts of Sam He had long since become the head of
the family She felt called upon to lecture him now and then but down
in her heart she believed that he could really do no wrong They joked
each other unmercifully and her wit never at a loss was quite as keen
as his




XVII

THE END OF PILOTING

When one remembers how much Samuel Clemens loved the river and how
perfectly he seemed suited to the ease and romance of the pilotlife one
is almost tempted to regret that it should so soon have come to an end

Those trips of early 61 which the old notebook records were the last
he would ever make The golden days of Mississippi steamboating were
growing few

Nobody however seemed to suspect it Even a celebrated fortuneteller
in New Orleans whom the young pilot one day consulted as to his future
did not mention the great upheaval then close at hand She told him
quite remarkable things and gave him some excellent advice but though
this was February 1861 she failed to make any mention of the Civil War
Yet a month later Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated and trouble was in
the air Then in April Fort Sumter was fired upon and the war had come

It was a feverish time among the pilots Some were for the Unionothers
would go with the Confederacy Horace Bixby stood for the North and in
time was chief of the Union riverservice A pilot named Montgomery
Clemens had once steered for him went with the South and by and by
commanded the Confederate Mississippi fleet In the beginning a good
many were not clear as to their opinions Living both North and South
as they did they divided their sympathies Samuel Clemens was
thoughtful and far from bloodthirsty A pilothouse so fine and showy
in times of peace seemed a poor place to be in when fighting was going
on He would consider the matter

I am not anxious to get up into a glass perch and be shot at by either
side he said Ill go home and reflect

He went up the river as a passenger on a steamer named the Uncle Sam
Zeb Leavenworth formerly of the John J Roe was one of the pilots
and Clemens usually stood the watch with him At Memphis they barely
escaped the blockade At Cairo they saw soldiers drillingtroops later
commanded by Grant

The Uncle Sam came steaming up to St Louis glad to have slipped
through safely They were not quite through however Abreast of
Jefferson Barracks they heard the boom of a cannon and a great ring of
smoke drifted in their direction They did not recognize it as a
thunderous Halt and kept on Less than a minute later a shell
exploded directly in front of the pilothouse breaking a lot of glass
and damaging the decoration Zeb Leavenworth tumbled into a corner

Geemighty Sam he said What do they mean by that

Clemens stepped from the visitors bench to the wheel and brought the
boat around

I guessthey want usto wait a minuteZeb he said

They were examined and passed It was the last steamboat to make the
trip through from New Orleans to St Louis Mark Twains pilot days were
over He would have grieved had he known this fact

I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since he
long afterward declared and I took a measureless pride in it

At the time like many others he expected the war to be brief and his
life to be only temporarily interrupted Within a year certainly he
would be back in the pilothouse Meantime the war must be settled he
would go up to Hannibal to see about it




XVIII

THE SOLDIER

When he reached Hannibal Samuel Clemens found a very mixed condition of
affairs The country was in an uproar of war preparation in a border
State there was a confusion of sympathies with much ignorance as to what
it was all about Any number of young men were eager to enlist for a
brief campingout expedition and small private companies were formed
composed about halfandhalf of Union and Confederate men as it turned
out later

Missouri meantime had allied herself with the South and Samuel
Clemens on his arrival in Hannibal decided that like Lee he would go
with his State Old friends who were getting up a company to help
Governor Claib Jackson repel the invader offered him a lieutenancy if
he would join It was not a big company it had only about a dozen
members most of whom had been schoolmates some of them fellowpilots
and Sam Clemens was needed to make it complete It was just another Tom
Sawyer band and they met in a secret place above Bear Creek Hill and
planned how they would sell their lives on the field of glory just as
years before fierce raids had been arranged on peachorchards and
melonpatches Secrecy was necessary for the Union militia had a habit
of coming over from Illinois and arresting suspicious armies on sight It
would humiliate the finest army in the world to spend a night or two in
the calaboose

So they met secretly at night and one mysterious evening they called on
girls who either were their sweethearts or were pretending to be for the
occasion and when the time came for goodby the girls were invited to
walk through the pickets with them though the girls didnt notice any
pickets because the pickets were calling on their girls too and were a
little late getting to their posts

That night they marched through brush and vines because the highroad
was thought to be dangerous and next morning arrived at the home of
Colonel Ralls of Ralls County who had the army form in dress parade and
made it a speech and gave it a hot breakfast in good Southern style
Then he sent out to Col Bill Splawn and Farmer Nuck Matson a requisition
for supplies that would convert this body of infantry into cavalry
roughriders of that early day The community did not wish to keep an
army on its hands and were willing to send it along by such means as
they could spare handily When the outfitting was complete Lieutenant
Samuel Clemens mounted on a small yellow mule whose tail had been
trimmed in the paintbrush pattern then much worn by mules and
surrounded by variously attached articlessuch as an extra pair of
cowhide boots a pair of gray blankets a homemade quilt a fryingpan
a carpetsack a small valise an overcoat an oldfashioned Kentucky
rifle twenty yards of rope and an umbrellawas a fair sample of the
brigade

An army like that to enjoy itself ought to go into camp so it went
over to Salt River near the town of Florida and took up headquarters in
a big log stable Somebody suggested that an army ought to have its hair
cut so that in a handtohand conflict the enemy could not get hold of
it There was a pair of sheepshears in the stable and Private Tom
Lyons acted as barber They were not sharp shears and a group of little
darkies gathered from the farm to enjoy the torture

Regular elections were now heldall officers down to sergeants and
orderlies being officially chosen There were only three privates and
you couldnt tell them from officers The discipline in that army was
very bad

It became worse soon Pouring rain set in Salt River rose and
overflowed the bottoms Men ordered on picket duty climbed up into the
stableloft and went to bed Twice on black drenching nights word
came from the farmhouse that the enemy commanded by a certain Col
Ulysses Grant was in the neighborhood and the Hannibal division went
hastily slopping through mud and brush in the other direction dragging
wearily back when the alarm was over Military ardor was bound to cool
under such treatment Then Lieutenant Clemens developed a very severe
boil and was obliged to lie most of the day on some hay in a
horsetrough where he spent his time denouncing the war and the mistaken
souls who had invented it When word that General Tom Harris commander
of the districtformerly telegraphoperator in Hannibalwas at a
nearby farmhouse living on the fat of the land the army broke camp
without further ceremony Halfway there they met General Harris who
ordered them back to quarters They called him familiarly Tom and told
him they were through with that camp forever He begged them but it was
no use A little farther on they stopped at a farmhouse for supplies A
tall bony woman came to the door

Youre Secesh aint you

Lieutenant Clemens said We are madam defenders of the noble cause
and we should like to buy a few provisions

The request seemed to inflame her

Provisions she screamed Provisions for Secesh and my husband a
colonel in the Union Army You get out of here

She reached for a hickory hooppole 5 that stood by the door and the
army moved on When they reached the home of Col Bill Splawn it was
night and the family had gone to bed So the hungry army camped in the
barnyard and crept into the hayloft to sleep Presently somebody
yelled Fire One of the boys had been smoking and had ignited the hay

Lieutenant Clemens suddenly wakened made a quick rotary movement away
from the blaze and rolled out of a big haywindow into the barnyard
below The rest of the brigade seized the burning hay and pitched it out
of the same window The lieutenant had sprained his ankle when he
struck and his boil was still painful but the burning hay cured him
for the moment He made a spring from under it then noticing that the
rest of the army now that the fire was out seemed to think his
performance amusing he rose up and expressed himself concerning the war
and military life and the human race in general They helped him in
then for his ankle was swelling badly

In the morning Colonel Splawn gave the army a good breakfast and it
moved on Lieutenant Clemens however did not get farther than Farmer
Nuck Matsons He was in a high fever by that time from his injured
ankle and Mrs Matson put him to bed So the army left him and
presently disbanded Some enlisted in the regular service North or
South according to preference Properly officered and disciplined that
Tom Sawyer band would have made as good soldiers as any

Lieutenant Clemens did not enlist again When he was able to walk he
went to visit Orion in Keokuk Orion was a Union Abolitionist but there
would be no unpleasantness on that account Samuel Clemens was beginning
to have leanings in that direction himself

5 In an earlier day barrel hoops were made of small hickory trees
split and shaved The hooppole was a very familiar article of commerce
and of household defense




XIX

THE PIONEER

He arrived in Keokuk at what seemed a lucky moment Through Edward
Bates a member of Lincolns Cabinet Orion Clemens had received an
appointment as territorial secretary of Nevada and only needed the money
to carry him to the seat of his office at Carson City Out of his
pilots salary his brother had saved more than enough for the journey
and was willing to pay both their fares and go along as private secretary
to Orion whose position promised something in the way of adventure and a
possible opportunity for making a fortune

The brothers went at once to St Louis for final leavetaking and there
took boat for St Jo Missouri terminus of the great Overland Stage
Route They paid one hundred and fifty dollars each for their passage
and about the end of July 1861 set out on that long delightful trip
behind sixteen galloping horses never stopping except for meals or to
change teams heading steadily into the sunset over the billowy plains
and snowclad Rockies covering the seventeen hundred miles between St
Jo and Carson City in nineteen glorious days

But one must read Mark Twains Roughing It for the story of that
longago tripthe joy and wonder of it and the inspiration Even at
this day he writes it thrills me through and through to think of the
life the gladness and the wild sense of freedom that used to make the
blood dance in my face on those fine overland mornings

It was a hot dusty August day when they arrived dusty unshaven and
weatherbeaten and Samuel Clemenss life as a frontiersman began
Carson City the capital of Nevada was a wooden town with an assorted
population of two thousand souls The mining excitement was at its
height and had brought together the drift of every race

The Clemens brothers took up lodgings with a genial Irishwoman the Mrs
OFlannigan of Roughing It and Orion established himself in a modest
office for there was no capitol building as yet no government
headquarters Orion could do all the work and Samuel Clemens finding
neither duties nor salary attached to his position gave himself up to
the study of the life about him and to the enjoyment of the freedom of
the frontier Presently he had a following of friends who loved his
quaint manner of speech and his yarns On cool nights they would collect
about Orions officestove and he would tell stories in the wonderful
way that one day would delight the world Within a brief time Sam
Clemens he was always Sam to the pioneers was the most notable figure
on the Carson streets His great bushy head of auburn hair has
piercing twinkling eyes his loose lounging walk his careless disorder
of dress invited a second look even from strangers From a river dandy
he had become the roughestclad of pioneersrusty slouch hat flannel
shirt coarse trousers slopping half in and half out of heavy cowhide
boots this was his makeup Energetic citizens did not prophesy success
for him Often they saw him leaning against an awning support staring
drowsily at the motley human procession for as much as an hour at a
time Certainly that could not be profitable

But they did like to hear him talk

He did not catch the mining fever at once He was interested first in
the riches that he could see Among these was the timberland around
Lake Bigler now Tahoesplendid acres to be had for the asking The
lake itself was beautifully situated

With an Ohio boy John Kinney he made an excursion afoot to Tahoe a
trip described in one of the best chapters of Roughing It They staked
out a timber claim and pretended to fence it and to build a house but
their chief employment was loafing in the quiet luxury of the great woods
or drifting in a boat on the transparent water They did not sleep in
the house In Roughing It he says

 It never occurred to us for one thing and besides it was built
 to hold the ground and that was enough We did not wish to strain
 it

They made their campfires on the borders of the lake and one evening it
got away from them fired the forest and destroyed their fences and
habitation In a letter home he describes this fire in a fine vivid
way At one place he says

 The level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the standard
 bearers as we called the tall dead trees wrapped in fire and
 waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air Then we
 could turn from the scene to the lake and see every branch and leaf
 and cataract of flame upon its banks perfectly reflected as in a
 gleaming fiery mirror

He was acquiring the literary vision and touch The description of this
same fire in Roughing It written ten years later is scarcely more
vivid

Most of his letters home at this time tell of glowing prospectsthe
certainty of fortune ahead The fever of the frontier is in them Once
to Pamela Moffett he wrote

 Orion and I have enough confidence in this country to think that if
 the war lets us alone we can make Mr Moffett rich without its ever
 costing him a cent or a particle of trouble

From the same letter we gather that the brothers are now somewhat
interested in mining claims

 We have about 1650 feet of miningground and if it proves good
 Mr Moffetts name will go in and if not I can get feet for him
 in the spring

This was written about the end of October Two months later in
midwinter the mining fever came upon him with full force

THE MINER

The wonder is that Samuel Clemens always speculative and visionary had
not fallen an earlier victim Everywhere one heard stories of sudden
fortuneof men who had gone to bed paupers and awakened millionaires
New and fabulous finds were reported daily Cartloads of brickssilver
and gold bricksdrove through the Carson streets

Then suddenly from the newly opened Humboldt region came the wildest
reports The mountains there were said to be stuffed with gold A
correspondent of the Territorial Enterprise was unable to find words to
picture the riches of the Humboldt mines

The air for Samuel Clemens began to shimmer Fortune was waiting to be
gathered in a basket He joined the first expedition for Humboldtin
fact helped to organize it In Roughing It he says

 Hurry was the word We wasted no time Our party consisted of four
 personsa blacksmith sixty years of age two young lawyers and
 myself We bought a wagon and two miserable old horses We put
 eighteen hundred pounds of provisions and miningtools in the wagon
 and drove out of Carson on a chilly December afternoon

The two young lawyers were W H Clagget whom Clemens had known in
Keokuk and A W Oliver called Oliphant in Roughing It The
blacksmith was named Tillou Ballou in Roughing It a sturdy honest
man with a knowledge of mining and the repair of tools There were also
two dogs in the partya curlytailed mongrel and a young hound

The horses were the weak feature of the expedition It was two hundred
miles to Humboldt mostly across sand The miners rode only a little
way then got out to lighten the load Later they pushed Then it began
to snow also to blow and the air became filled with whirling clouds of
snow and sand On and on they pushed and groaned sustained by the
knowledge that they must arrive some time when right away they would be
millionaires and all their troubles would be over

The nights were better The wind went down and they made a campfire in
the shelter of the wagon cooked their bacon crept under blankets with
the dogs to warm them and Sam Clemens spun yarns till they fell asleep

There had been an Indian war and occasionally they passed the charred
ruin of a cabin and new graves By and by they came to that deadly waste
known as the Alkali Desert strewn with the carcasses of dead beasts and
with the heavy articles discarded by emigrants in their eagerness to
reach water All day and night they pushed through that choking
waterless plain to reach camp on the other side When they arrived at
three in the morning they dropped down exhausted Judge Oliver the
last survivor of the party in a letter to the writer of these chapters
said

 The sun was high in the heavens when we were aroused from our sleep
 by a yelling band of Piute warriors We were upon our feet in an
 instant The picture of burning cabins and the lonely graves we had
 passed was in our minds Our scalps were still our own and not
 dangling from the belts of our visitors Sam pulled himself
 together put his hand on his head as if to make sure he had not
 been scalped and with his inimitable drawl said Boys they have
 left us our scalps Let us give them all the flour and sugar they
 ask for And we did give them a good supply for we were grateful

The Indians left them unharmed and the prospective millionaires moved
on Across that two hundred miles to the Humboldt country they pushed
arriving at the little camp of Unionville at the end of eleven weary
days

In Roughing It Mark Twain has told us of Unionville and the mining
experience there Their cabin was a threesided affair with a cotton
roof Stones rolled down the mountainside on them also the author
says a mule and a cow

The author could not gather fortune in a basket as he had dreamed
Masses of gold and silver were not lying about He gathered a backload
of yellow glittering specimens but they proved worthless Gold in the
rough did not glitter and was not yellow Tillou instructed the others
in prospecting and they went to work with pick and shovelthen with
drill and blastingpowder The prospect of immediately becoming
millionaires vanished

One week of this satisfied me I resigned is Mark Twains brief
comment

The Humboldt reports had been exaggerated The ClemensClaggetOliver
Tillou millionaire combination soon surrendered its claims Clemens and
Tillou set out for Carson City with a Prussian named Pfersdorff who
nearly got them drowned and got them completely lost in the snow before
they arrived there Oliver and Clagget remained in Unionville began law
practice and were elected to office It is not known what became of the
wagon and horses and the two dogs

It was the end of January when our miner returned to Carson He was not
discouragedfar from it He believed he had learned something that
would be useful to him in a camp where mines were a reality Within a
few weeks from his return we find him at Aurora in the Esmeralda region
on the edge of California It was here that the Clemens brothers owned
the 1650 feet formerly mentioned He had came down to work it

It was the dead of winter but he was full of enthusiasm confident of a
fortune by early summer To Pamela he wrote

 I expect to return to St Louis in Julyper steamer I dont say
 that I will return then or that I shall be able to do itbut I
 expect toyou bet     If nothing goes wrong well strike
 the ledge in June

He was trying to be conservative and further along he cautions his
sister not to get excited

 Dont you know I have only talked as yet but proved nothing Dont
 you know I have never held in my hands a gold or silver bar that
 belonged to me Dont you know that people who always feel jolly
 no matter where they are or what happens to themwho have the organ
 of hope preposterously developedwho are endowed with an
 uncongealable sanguine temperamentwho never feel concerned about
 the price of cornand who cannot by any possibility discover any
 but the bright side of a pictureare very apt to go to extremes and
 exaggerate with a 40horse microscopic power

 Butbut

 In the bright lexicon of youth
 There is no such word as fail
 and Ill prove it

Whereupon he soars again adding page after page full of glowing
expectations and plans such as belong only with speculation in treasures
buried in the grounda very difficult place indeed to find them

His money was about exhausted by this time and funds to work the mining
claims must come out of Orions rather modest salary The brothers owned
all claims in partnership and it was now the part of Brother Sam to do
the active work He hated the hard picking and prying and blasting into
the flinty ledges but the fever drove him on He camped with a young
man named Phillips at first and later on with an experienced miner
Calvin H Higbie to whom Roughing It would one day be dedicated They
lived in a tiny cabin with a cotton roof and around their rusty stove
they would paw over their specimens and figure the fortune that their
mines would be worth in the spring

Food ran low money gave out almost entirely but they did not give up
When it was stormy and they could not dig and the expilot was in a
talkative vein he would sit astride the bunk and distribute to his
hearers riches more valuable than any they would dig from the Esmeralda
hills At other times he did not talk at all but sat in a corner and
wrote They thought he was writing home they did not know that he was
literary Some of his home letters had found their way into a Keokuk
paper and had come back to Orion who had shown them to an assistant on
the Territorial Enterprise of Virginia City The Enterprise man had
caused one of them to be reprinted and this had encouraged its author to
send something to the paper direct He signed these contributions
Josh and one told of

 An old old horse whose name was Methusalem
 Took him down and sold him in Jerusalem
 A long time ago

He received no pay for these offerings and expected none He considered
them of no value If any one had told him that he was knocking at the
door of the house of fame however feebly he would have doubted that
persons judgment or sincerity

His letters to Orion in Carson City were hasty compositions reporting
progress and progress or calling for remittances to keep the work going
On April 13 he wrote

 Work not begun on the Horatio and Derbyhavent seen it yet It is
 still in the snow Shall begin on it within three or four weeks
 strike the ledge in July

Again later in the month

 I have been at work all day blasting and digging in one of our new
 claims Dashaway which I dont think a great deal of but which I
 am willing to try We are down now ten or twelve feet

It must have been disheartening work picking away at the flinty ledges
There is no further mention of the Dashaway but we hear of the
Flyaway the Annipolitan the Live Yankee and of many another
each of which holds out a beacon of hope for a brief moment then passes
from notice forever Still he was not discouraged Once he wrote

 I am a citizen here and I am satisfied though Ratio and I are
 strapped and we havent three days rations in the house I shall
 work the Monitor and the other claims with my own hands

 The pick and shovel are the only claims I have confidence in now
 he wrote later my back is sore and my hands are blistered with
 handling them today

His letters began to take on a weary tone Once in midsummer he wrote
that it was still snowing up there in the hills and added It always
snows here I expect If we strike it rich Ive lost my guess thats
all And the final heartsick line Dont you suppose they have pretty
much quit writing at home

In time he went to work in a quartzmill at ten dollars a week though it
was not entirely for the money as in Roughing It he would have us
believe Samuel Clemens learned thoroughly what he undertook and he
proposed to master the science of mining From Phillips and Higbie he
had learned what there was to know about prospecting He went to the
mill to learn refining so that when his claims developed he could
establish a mill and personally superintend the work His stay was
brief He contracted a severe cold and came near getting poisoned by the
chemicals Recovering he went with Higbie for an outing to Mono Lake a
ghastly lifeless alkali sea among the hills vividly described in
Roughing It

At another time he went with Higbie on a walking trip to the Yosemite
where they camped and fished undisturbed for in those days few human
beings came to that far isolation Discouragement did not reach them
thereamid that vast grandeur and quiet the quest for gold hardly seemed
worth while Now and again that summer he went alone into the wilderness
to find his balance and to get entirely away from humankind

In Roughing It Mark Twain tells the story of how he and Higbie finally
located a blind lead which made them really millionaires until they
forfeited their claim through the sharp practice of some rival miners and
their own neglect It is true that the Wide West claim was forfeited
in some such manner but the size of the loss was magnified in Roughing
It to make a good story There was never a fortune in Wide West
except the one sunk in it by its final owners The story as told in
Roughing It is a tale of what might have happened and ends the
authors days in the mines with a good storybook touch

The mining career of Samuel Clemens really came to a close gradually and
with no showy climax He fought hard and surrendered little by little
without owning even to the end that he was surrendering at all It was
the gift of resolution that all his life would make his defeats long and
costlyhis victories supreme

By the end of July the money situation in the Aurora camp was getting
desperate Orions depleted salary would no longer pay for food tools
and blastingpowder and the miner began to cast about far means to earn
an additional sum however small The Josh letters to the Enterprise
had awakened interest as to their author and Orion had not failed to let
Joshs identity be known The result had been that here and there a
coast paper had invited contributions and even suggested payment A
letter written by the Aurora miner at the end of July tells this part of
the story

 My debts are greater than I thought for     The fact is I
 must have something to do and that shortly too     Now
 write to the Sacramento Union folks or to Marsh and tell them
 that I will write as many letters a week as they want for 10 a
 week My board must be paid

 Tell them I have corresponded with the New Orleans Crescent and
 other papersand the Enterprise

 If they want letters from herewholl run from morning till night
 collecting material cheaper Ill write a short letter twice a week
 for the present for the Age for 5 per week Now it has been a
 long time since I couldnt make my own living and it shall be a long
 time before I loaf another year

This all led to nothing but about the same time the Enterprise
assistant already mentioned spoke to Joseph T Goodman owner and editor
of the paper about adding Josh to their regular staff Joe Goodman
a man of keen humor and literary perception agreed that the author of
the Josh letters might be useful to them One of the sketches
particularly appealed to hima burlesque report of a Fourth of July
oration

That is the kind of thing we want he said Write to him Barstow
and ask him if he wants to come up here

Barstow wrote offering twentyfive dollars a weeka tempting sum This
was at the end of July 1862

Yet the hardpressed miner made no haste to accept the offer To leave
Aurora meant the surrender of all hope in the mines the confession of
another failure He wrote Barstow asking when he thought he might be
needed And at the same time in a letter to Orion he said

 I shall leave at midnight tonight alone and on foot for a walk of
 sixty or seventy miles through a totally uninhabited country But
 do you write Barstow that I have left here for a week or so and in
 case he should want me he must write me here or let me know
 through you

He had gone into the wilderness to fight out his battle alone postponing
the final moment of surrendersurrender that had he known only meant
the beginning of victory He was still undecided when he returned eight
days later and wrote to his sister Pamela a letter in which there is no
mention of newspaper prospects

Just how and when the end came at last cannot be known but one hot
dusty August afternoon in Virginia City a worn travelstained pilgrim
dragged himself into the office of the Territorial Enterprise then in
its new building on C Street and loosening a heavy roll of blankets
from his shoulder dropped wearily into a chair He wore a rusty slouch
hat no coat a faded blueflannel shirt a navy revolver his trousers
were tucked into his boottops a tangle of reddishbrown hair fell on
his shoulders a mass of tawny beard dingy with alkali dust dropped
halfway to his waist

Aurora lay one hundred and thirty miles from Virginia City He had
walked that distance carrying his heavy load Editor Goodman was absent
at the moment but the other proprietor Dennis E McCarthy asked the
caller to state his errand The wanderer regarded him with a faraway
look and said absently and with deliberation

 My starboard leg seems to be unshipped Id like about one hundred
 yards of line I think Im falling to pieces Then he added I
 want to see Mr Barstow or Mr Goodman My name is Clemens and
 Ive come to write for the paper

It was the master of the worlds widest estate come to claim his kingdom




XXI

THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE

In 1852 Virginia City Nevada was the most flourishing of mining towns
A halfcrazy miner named Comstock had discovered there a vein of such
richness that the Comstock Lode was presently glutting the mineral
markets of the world Comstock himself got very little out of it but
those who followed him made millions Miners speculators adventurers
swarmed in Every one seemed to have money The streets seethed with an
eager affluent boisterous throng whose chief business seemed to be to
spend the wealth that the earth was yielding in such a mighty stream

Business of every kind boomed Less than two years earlier J T
Goodman a miner who was also a printer and a man of literary taste had
joined with another printer Dennis McCarthy and the two had managed to
buy a struggling Virginia City paper the Territorial Enterprise But
then came the hightide of fortune A year later the Enterprise from a
starving sheet in a leaky shanty had become a large handsome paper in a
new building and of such brilliant editorial management that it was the
most widely considered journal on the Pacific coast

Goodman was a fine forceful writer and he surrounded himself with able
men He was a young man full of health and vigor overflowing with the
fresh spirit and humor of the West Comstockers would always laugh at a
joke and Goodman was always willing to give it to them The
Enterprise was a newspaper but it was willing to furnish entertainment
even at the cost of news William Wright editorially next to Goodman
was a humorist of ability His articles signed Dan de Quille were
widely copied R M Daggett afterward United States Minister to
Hawaii was also an Enterprise man and there were others of their
sort

Samuel Clemens fitted precisely into this group He brought with him a
new turn of thought and expression he saw things with open eyes and
wrote of them in a fresh wild way that Comstockers loved He was
allowed full freedom Goodman suppressed nothing his men could write as
they chose They were all young togetherif they pleased themselves
they were pretty sure to please their readers Often they wrote of one
anothersquibs and burlesques which gratified the Comstock far more
than mere news It was just the school to produce Mark Twain

The new arrival found acquaintance easy The whole Enterprise force
was like one family proprietors editor and printers were social
equals Samuel Clemens immediately became Sam to his associates just
as De Quille was Dan and Goodman Joe Clemens was supposed to
report city items and did in fact do such work which he found easy
for his pilotmemory made notes unnecessary

He could gather items all day and at night put down the days budget
well enough at least to delight his readers When he was tired of
facts he would write amusing paragraphs as often as not something about
Dan or a reporter on a rival paper Dan and the others would reply and
the Comstock would laugh Those were good old days

Sometimes he wrote hoaxes Once he told with great circumstance and
detail of a petrified prehistoric man that had been found embedded in a
rock in the desert and how the coroner from Humboldt had traveled more
than a hundred miles to hold an inquest over a man dead for centuries
and had refused to allow miners to blast the discovery from its position

The sketch was really intended as a joke on the Humboldt coroner but it
was so convincingly written that most of the Coast papers took it
seriously and reprinted it as the story of a genuine discovery In time
they awoke and began to inquire as to who was the smart writer on the
Enterprise

Mark Twain did a number of such things some of which are famous on the
Coast to this day

Clemens himself did not escape Lamps were used in the Enterprise
office but he hated the care of a lamp and worked evenings by the light
of a candle It was considered a great joke in the office to hide Sams
candle and hear him fume and rage walking in a circle meantimea habit
acquired in the pilothouseand scathingly denouncing the culprits
Eventually the officeboy supposedly innocent would bring another
candle and quiet would follow Once the office force including De
Quille McCarthy and a printer named Stephen Gillis of whom Clemens was
very fond bought a large imitation meerschaum pipe had a Germansilver
plate set on it properly engraved and presented it to Samuel Clemens as
genuine in testimony of their great esteem His reply to the
presentation speech was so fine and full of feeling that the jokers felt
ashamed of their trick A few days later when he discovered the
deception he was ready to destroy the lot of them Then in atonement
they gave him a real meerschaum Such things kept the Comstock
entertained

There was a side to Samuel Clemens that in those days few of his
associates saw This was the poetic the reflective side Joseph
Goodman like Macfarlane in Cincinnati several years earlier recognized
this phase of his character and developed it Often these two dining or
walking together discussed the books and history they had read quoted
from poems that gave them pleasure Clemens sometimes recited with great
power the Burial of Moses whose noble phrasing and majestic imagery
seemed to move him deeply With eyes half closed and chin lifted a
lighted cigar between his fingers he would lose himself in the music of
the stately lines

 By Nebos lonely mountain
 On this side Jordans wave
 In a vale in the land of Moab
 There lies a lonely grave
 And no man knows that sepulcher
 And no man saw it eer
 For the angels of God upturned the sod
 And laid the dead man there

That his own writing would be influenced by the simple grandeur of this
poem we can hardly doubt Indeed it may have been to him a sort of
literary touchstone that in time would lead him to produce as has been
said some of the purest English written by any modern author




XXII

MARK TWAIN

It was once when Goodman and Clemens were dining together that the latter
asked to be allowed to report the proceedings of the coming legislature
at Carson City He knew nothing of such work and Goodman hesitated
Then remembering that Clemens would at least make his reports
readable whether they were parliamentary or not he consented

So at the beginning of the year 1863 Samuel Clemens undertook a new
and interesting course in the study of human naturethe political human
nature of the frontier There could have been no better school for him
His wit his satire his phrasing had full swinghis letters almost
from the beginning were copied as choice reading up and down the Coast
He made curious blunders at first as to the proceedings but his open
confession of ignorance in the early letters made these blunders their
chief charm A young man named Gillespie clerk of the House coached
him and in return was christened Young Jeffersons Manual a title
which he bore for many years

A reporter named Rice on a rival Virginia City paper the Union also
earned for himself a title through those early letters

Rice concluded to poke fun at the Enterprise reports pointing out
their mistakes But this was not wise Clemens in his next
contribution admitted that Rices reports might be parliamentary enough
but declared his glittering technicalities were only to cover
misstatements of fact He vowed they were wholly untrustworthy dubbed
the author of them The Unreliable and never thereafter referred to him
by any other term Carson and the Comstock papers delighted in this
foolery and Rice became The Unreliable for life There was no real
feeling between Rice and Clemens They were always the best of friends

But now we arrive at the story of still another name one of vastly
greater importance than either of those mentioned for it is the name
chosen by Samuel Clemens for himself In those days it was the fashion
for a writer to have a penname especially for his journalistic and
humorous work Clemens felt that his Enterprise letters copied up and
down the Coast needed a mark of identity

He gave the matter a good deal of thought He wanted something brief and
strongsomething that would stick in the mind It was just at this time
that news came of the death of Capt Isaiah Sellers the old pilot who
had signed himself Mark Twain Mark Twain That was the name he
wanted It was not trivial It had all the desired qualities Captain
Sellers would never need it again It would do no harm to keep it alive
to give it a new meaning in a new land Clemens took a trip from Carson
up to Virginia City

Joe he said to Goodman I want to sign my articles I want to be
identified to a wider audience

All right Sam What name do you want to use Josh

No I want to sign them Mark Twain It is an old river term a
leadsmans call signifying two fathomstwelve feet It has a richness
about it it was always a pleasant sound for a pilot to hear on a dark
night it meant safe waters

He did not mention that Captain Sellers had used and dropped the name
He was not proud of his part in that episode and it was too recent for
confession

Goodman considered a moment Very well Sam he said that sounds
like a good name

A good name indeed Probably if he had considered every combination of
words in the language he could not have found a better one Today we
recognize it as the greatest nom de plume ever chosen and somehow we
cannot believe that the writer of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn and
Roughing It could have selected any other had he tried

The name Mark Twain was first signed to a Carson letter February 2
1863 and after that to all of Samuel Clemenss work The letters that
had amused so many readers had taken on a new interestthe interest that
goes with a name It became immediately more than a penname Clemens
found he had attached a name to himself as well as to his letters
Everybody began to address him as Mark Within a few weeks he was no
longer Sam or Clemens but MarkMark Twain The Coast papers liked
the sound of it It began to mean something to their readers By the
end of that legislative session Samuel Clemens as Mark Twain had
acquired out there on that breezy Western slope something resembling
fame

Curiously he fails to mention any of this success in his letters home of
that period Indeed he seldom refers to his work but more often speaks
of mining shares which he has accumulated and their possible values
His letters are airy full of the joy of life and of the wild doings of
the frontier Closing one of them he says I have just heard five
pistolshots down the street As such things are in my line I will go
and see about it

And in a postscript later he adds

 5 AMThe pistolshots did their work well One man a Jackson
 County Missourian shot two of my friends police officers through
 the heartboth died within three minutes The murderers name is
 John Campbell

The Comstock was a great school for Mark Twain and in Roughing It he
has left us a faithful picture of its longvanished glory

More than one national character came out of the Comstock school
Senator James G Fair was one of them and John Mackay both miners with
pick and shovel at first though Mackay presently became a
superintendent Mark Twain one day laughingly offered to trade jobs with
Mackay

No Mackay said I cant trade My business is not worth as much as
yours I have never swindled anybody and I dont intend to begin now

For both these men the future held splendid gifts for Mackay vast
wealth for Mark Twain the worlds applause and neither would have long
to wait

ARTEMUS WARD AND LITERARY SAN FRANCISCO

It was about the end of 1863 that a new literary impulse came into Mark
Twains life The gentle and lovable humorist Artemus Ward Charles F
Browne was that year lecturing in the West and came to Virginia City
Ward had intended to stay only a few days but the whirl of the Comstock
fascinated him He made the Enterprise office his headquarters and
remained three weeks He and Mark Twain became boon companions Their
humor was not unlike they were kindred spirits together almost
constantly Ward was then at the summit of his fame and gave the
younger man the highest encouragement prophesying great things for ha
work Clemens on his side was stirred perhaps for the first time
with a real literary ambition and the thought that he too might win a
place of honor He promised Ward that he would send work to the Eastern
papers

On Christmas Eve Ward gave a dinner to the Enterprise staff at
Chaumonds a fine French restaurant of that day When refreshments
came Artemus lifted his glass and said

I give you Upper Canada

The company rose and drank the toast in serious silence Then Mr
Goodman said

Of course Artemus its all right but why did you give us Upper
Canada

Because I dont want it myself said Ward gravely

What would one not give to have listened to the talk of that evening
Mark Twains power had awakened Artemus Ward was in his prime They
were giants of a race that became extinct when Mark Twain died

Goodman remained rather quiet during the evening Ward had appointed him
to order the dinner and he had attended to this duty without mingling
much in the conversation When Ward asked him why he did not join the
banter he said

I am preparing a joke Artemus but I am keeping it for the present

At a late hour Ward finally called for the bill It was two hundred and
thirtyseven dollars

What exclaimed Artemus

Thats my joke said Goodman

But I was only exclaiming because it was not twice as much laughed
Ward laying the money on the table

Ward remained through the holidays and later wrote back an affectionate
letter to Mark Twain

I shall always remember Virginia as a bright spot in my existence he
said as all others must or rather cannot be as it were

With Artemus Wards encouragement Mark Twain now began sending work
eastward The New York Sunday Mercury published one possibly more of
his sketches but they were not in his best vein and made little
impression He may have been too busy for outside work for the
legislative session of 1864 was just beginning Furthermore he had been
chosen governor of the Third House a mock legislature organized for
one session to be held as a church benefit The governor was to
deliver a message which meant that he was to burlesque from the platform
all public officials and personages from the real governor down

With the exception of a short talk he had once given at a printers
dinner in Keokuk it was Mark Twains first appearance as a speaker and
the beginning of a lifelong series of triumphs on the platform The
building was packedthe aisles full The audience was ready for fun
and he gave it to them Nobody escaped ridicule from beginning to end
the house was a storm of laughter and applause

Not a word of this first address of Mark Twains has been preserved but
those who heard it always spoke of it as the greatest effort of his life
as to them it seemed no doubt

For his Third House address Clemens was presented with a gold watch
inscribed To Governor Mark Twain Everywhere now he was pointed out
as a distinguished figure and his quaint remarks were quoted Few of
these sayings are remembered today though occasionally one is still
unforgotten At a party one night being urged to make a conundrum he
said

Well why am I like the Pacific Ocean

Several guesses were made but he shook his head Some one said

We give it up Tell us Mark why are you like the Pacific Ocean

Idontknow he drawled I was justasking for information

The governor of Nevada was generally absent and Orion Clemens was
executive head of the territory His wife who had joined him in Carson
City was social head of the little capital and Brother Sam with his
new distinction and now once more something of a dandy in dress was
societys chief ornamenta great change certainly from the early
months of his arrival less than three years before

It was near the end of May 1864 when Mark Twain left Nevada for San
Francisco The immediate cause of his going was a duela duel
elaborately arranged between Mark Twain and the editor of a rival paper
but never fought In fact it was mainly a burlesque affair throughout
chiefly concocted by that inveterate joker Steve Gillis already
mentioned in connection with the pipe incident The new dueling law
however did not distinguish between real and mock affrays and the
prospect of being served with a summons made a good excuse for Clemens
and Gillis to go to San Francisco which had long attracted them They
were great friends these two and presently were living together and
working on the same paper the Morning Call Clemens as a reporter and
Gillis as a compositor

Gillis with his tendency to mischief was a constant exasperation to his
roommate who goaded by some new torture would sometimes denounce him
in feverish terms Yet they were never anything but the closest friends

Mark Twain did not find happiness in his new position on the Call
There was less freedom and more drudgery than he had known on the
Enterprise His day was spent around the police court attending
fires weddings and funerals with brief glimpses of the theaters at
night

Once he wrote It was fearful drudgerysoulless drudgeryand almost
destitute of interest It was an awful slavery for a lazy man

It must have been so There was little chance for original work He had
become just a part of a news machine He saw many public abuses that he
wished to expose but the policy of the paper opposed him Once
however he found a policeman asleep on his beat Going to a nearby
vegetable stall he borrowed a large cabbageleaf came back and stood
over the sleeper gently fanning him He knew the paper would not
publish the policemans negligence but he could advertise it in his own
way A large crowd soon collected much amused When he thought the
audience large enough he went away Next day the joke was all over the
city

He grew indifferent to the Call work and when an assistant was
allowed him to do part of the running for items it was clear to
everybody that presently the assistant would be able to do it all

But there was a pleasant and profitable side to the San Francisco life
There were real literary people thereamong them a young man with rooms
upstairs in the Call office Francis Bret Harte editor of the
Californian a new literary weekly which Charles Henry Webb had
recently founded Bret Harte was not yet famous but his gifts were
recognized on the Pacific slope especially by the Era group of
writers the Golden Era being a literary monthly of considerable
distinction Joaquin Miller recalls from his diary of that period
having seen Prentice Mulford Bret Harte Charles Warren Stoddard Mark
Twain Artemus Ward and others all assembled there at one timea
remarkable group certainly to be dropped down behind the Sierras so
long ago They were a hopeful happy lot and sometimes received five
dollars for an article which of course seemed a good deal more
precious than a much larger sum earned in another way

Mark Twain had contributed to the Era while still in Virginia City and
now with Bret Harte was ranked as a leader of the group The two were
much together and when Harte became editor of the Californian he
engaged Clemens as a regular contributor at the very fancy rate of twelve
dollars an article Some of the brief chapters included today in
Sketches New and Old were done at this time They have humor but are
not equal to his later work and beyond the Pacific slope they seem to
have attracted little attention

In Roughing It the author tells us how he finally was dismissed from
the Call for general incompetency and presently found himself in the
depths of hard luck debt and poverty But this is only his old habit
of making a story on himself sound as uncomplimentary as possible The
true version is that the Call publisher and Mark Twain had a friendly
talk and decided that it was better for both to break off the connection
Almost immediately he arranged to write a daily San Francisco letter for
the Enterprise for which he received thirty dollars a week This
with his earnings from the Californian made his total return larger
than before Very likely he was hard up from time to timeliterary men
are often thatbut that he was ever in abject poverty as he would have
us believe is just a good story and not history

THE DISCOVERY OF THE JUMPING FROG

Mark Twains daily letters to the Enterprise stirred up trouble for him
in San Francisco He was free now to write what he chose and he
attacked the corrupt police management with such fierceness that when
copies of the Enterprise got back to San Francisco they started a
commotion at the city hall Then Mark Twain let himself go more
vigorously than ever He sent letters to the Enterprise that made even
the printers afraid Goodman however was fearless and let them go in
word for word The libel suit which the San Francisco chief of police
brought against the Enterprise advertised the paper amazingly

But now came what at the time seemed an unfortunate circumstance Steve
Gillis always a fearless defender of the weak one night rushed to the
assistance of two young fellows who had been set upon by three roughs
Gillis though small of stature was a terrific combatant and he
presently put two of the assailants to flight and had the other ready for
the hospital Next day it turned out that the roughs were henchmen of
the police and Gillis was arrested

Clemens went his bail and advised Steve to go down to Virginia City
until the storm blew over

But it did not blow over for Mark Twain The police department was only
too glad to have a chance at the author of the fierce Enterprise
letters and promptly issued a summons for him with an execution against
his personal effects If James N Gillis brother of Steve had not
happened along just then and spirited Mark Twain away to his miningcamp
in the Tuolumne Hills the beautiful gold watch given to the governor of
the Third House might have been sacrificed in the cause of friendship

As it was he found himself presently in the far and peaceful seclusion
of that land which Bret Harte would one day make famous with his tales of
Roaring Camp and Sandy Bar Jim Gillis was in fact the Truthful
James of Bret Harte and his cabin on jackass Hill had been the retreat
of Harte and many another literary wayfarer who had wandered there for
rest and refreshment and peace It was said the sick were made well and
the well made better in Jim Gilliss cabin There were plenty of books
and a variety of outofdoor recreation One could mine there if he
chose Jim would furnish the visiting author with a promising claim and
teach him to follow the little fanlike drift of gold specks to the
pocket of treasure somewhere up the hillside

Gillis himself had literary ability though he never wrote He told his
stories and with his back to the open fire would weave the most amazing
tales invented as he went along His stories were generally wonderful
adventures that had happened to his faithful companion Stoker and
Stoker never denied them but would smoke and look into the fire smiling
a little sometimes but never saying a word A number of the tales later
used by Mark Twain were first told by Jim Gillis in the cabin on Jackass
Hill Dick Bakers Cat was one of these the jaybird and acorn story
in A Tramp Abroad was another Mark Twain had little to add to these
stories

They are not mine they are Jims he said once but I never could
get them to sound like Jimthey were never as good as his

It was early in December 1864 when Mark Twain arrived at the humble
retreat built of logs under a great liveoak tree and surrounded by a
stretch of bluegrass A younger Gillis boy was there at the time and
also of course Dick Stoker and his cat Tom Quartz which every reader
of Roughing It knows

It was the rainy season but on pleasant days they all went
pocketmining and in January Mark Twain Gillis and Stoker crossed
over into Calaveras County and began work near Angels Camp a place well
known to readers of Bret Harte They put up at a poor hotel in Angels
and on good days worked pretty faithfully But it was generally raining
and the food was poor

In his notebook still preserved Mark Twain wrote January 27 1865
Same old dietsame old weatherwent out to the pocketclaimhad to
rush back

So they spent a good deal of their time around the rusty stove in the
dilapidated tavern at Angels Camp It seemed a profitless thing to do
but few experiences were profitless to Mark Twain and certainly this one
was not

At this barren mining hotel there happened to be a former Illinois River
pilot named Ben Coon a solemn sleepy person who dozed by the stove or
told slow pointless stories to any one who would listen Not many would
stay to hear him but Jim Gillis and Mark Twain found him a delight
They would let him wander on in his dull way for hours and saw a vast
humor in a man to whom all tales however trivial or absurd were serious
history

At last one dreary afternoon he told them about a froga frog that had
belonged to a man named Coleman who had trained it to jump and how the
trained frog had failed to win a wager because the owner of the rival
frog had slyly loaded the trained jumper with shot It was not a new
story in the camps but Ben Coon made a long tale of it and it happened
that neither Clemens nor Gillis had heard it before They thought it
amusing and his solemn way of telling it still more so

I dont see no pints about that frog thats better than any other
frog became a catch phrase among the mining partners and I aint
got no frog but if I had a frog Id bet you

Out on the claim Clemens watching Gillis and Stoker anxiously washing
would say I dont see no pints about that pan o dirt thats any better
than any other pan o dirt And so they kept the tale going In his
notebook Mark Twain made a brief memorandum of the story for possible
use

The mining was rather hopeless work The constant and heavy rains were
disheartening Clemens hated it and even when one afternoon traces of
a pocket began to appear he rebelled as the usual chill downpour set in

Jim he said lets go home well freeze here

Gillis as usual was washing and Clemens carrying the water Gillis
seeing the gold color improving with every pan wanted to go on washing
and climbing toward the precious pocket regardless of wet and cold
Clemens shivering and disgusted vowed that each pail of water would be
his last His teeth were chattering and he was wet through Finally he
said

Jim I wont carry any more water This work too disagreeable

Gillis had just taken out a panful of dirt

Bring one more pail Sam he begged

Jim I wont do it Imfreezing

Just one more pail Sam Jim pleaded

No sir not a dropnot if I knew there was a million dollars in that
pan

Gillis tore out a page of his notebook and hastily posted a
thirtydayclaim notice by the pan of dirt Then they set out for Angels
Camp never to return It kept on raining and a letter came from Steve
Gillis saying he had settled all the trouble in San Francisco Clemens
decided to return and the miners left Angels without visiting their
claim again

Meantime the rain had washed away the top of the pan of dirt they had
left standing on the hillside exposing a handful of nuggets pure gold
Two strangers Austrians happening along gathered it up and seeing the
claim notice posted by Jim Gillis sat down to wait until it expired
They did not mind the rainnot under the circumstancesand the moment
the thirty days were up they followed the lead a few pans farther and
took out some say ten some say twenty thousand dollars In either
case it was a good pocket that Mark Twain missed by one pail of water
Still without knowing it he had carried away in his notebook a single
nugget of far greater value the story of The Jumping Frog

He did not write it however immediately upon his return to San
Francisco He went back to his Enterprise letters and contributed some
sketches to the Californian Perhaps he thought the frog story too mild
in humor for the slope By and by he wrote it and by request sent it to
Artemus Ward to be used in a book that Ward was about to issue It
arrived too late and the publisher handed it to the editor of the
Saturday Press Henry Clapp saying

Here Clapp is something you can use in your paper

The Press was struggling and was glad to get a story so easily Jim
Smiley and his jumping Frog appeared in the issue of November 18 1865
and was at once copied and quoted far and near It carried the name of
Mark Twain across the mountains and the prairies of the Middle West it
bore it up and down the Atlantic slope Some one said then or later
that Mark Twain leaped into fame on the back of a jumping frog

Curiously this did not at first please the author He thought the tale
poor To his mother he wrote

I do not know what to write my life is so uneventful I wish I was back
there piloting up and down the river again Verily all is vanity and
little worthsave piloting

To think that after writing many an article a man might be excused for
thinking tolerably good those New York people should single out a
villainous backwoods sketch to compliment me onJim Smiley and his
Jumping Froga squib which would never have been written but to please
Artemus Ward

However somewhat later he changed his mind considerably especially when
he heard that James Russell Lowell had pronounced the story the finest
piece of humorous writing yet produced in America

HAWAII AND ANSON BURLINGAME

Mark Twain remained about a year in San Francisco after his return from
the Gillis cabin and Angels Camp adding to his prestige along the Coast
rather than to his national reputation Then in the spring of 1866 he
was commissioned by the Sacramento Union to write a series of letters
that would report the life trade agriculture and general aspects of
the Hawaiian group He sailed in March and his four months in those
delectable islands remained always to him a golden memoryan experience
which he hoped some day to repeat He was young and eager for adventure
then and he went everywherehorseback and afootsaw everything did
everything and wrote of it all for his paper His letters to the
Union were widely read and quoted and though not especially literary
added much to his journalistic standing He was a great sightseer in
those days and a persevering one No discomfort or risk discouraged
him Once with a single daring companion he crossed the burning floor
of the mighty crater of Kilauea racing across the burning lava leaping
wide and bottomless crevices where a misstep would have meant death His
openair life on the river and in the miningcamps had nerved and
hardened him for adventure He was thirty years old and in his physical
prime His mental growth had been slower but it was sure and it would
seem always to have had the right guidance at the right time

Clemens had been in the islands three months when one day Anson
Burlingame arrived there en route to his post as minister to China
With him was his son Edward a boy of eighteen and General Van
Valkenburg minister to Japan Young Burlingame had read about Jim
Smileys jumping frog and learning that the author was in Honolulu but
ill after a long trip inland sent word that the party would call on him
next morning But Mark Twain felt that he could not accept this honor
and crawling out of bed shaved himself and drove to the home of the
American minister where the party was staying He made a great
impression with the diplomats It was an occasion of good stories and
much laughter On leaving General Van Valkenburg said to him

 California is proud of Mark Twain and some day the American people
 will be too no doubt Which was certainly a good prophecy

It was only a few days later that the diplomats rendered him a great
service Report had come of the arrival at Sanpahoe of an open boat
containing fifteen starving men who had been buffeting a stormy sea for
fortythree dayssailors from the missing ship Hornet of New York
which it appeared had been burned at sea Presently eleven of the
rescued men were brought to Honolulu and placed in the hospital

Mark Twain recognized the great importance as news of this event It
would be a splendid beat if he could interview the castaways and be the
first to get their story in his paper There was no cable but a vessel
was sailing for San Francisco next morning It seemed the opportunity of
a lifetime but he was now bedridden and could scarcely move

Then suddenly appeared in his room Anson Burlingame and his party and
almost before Mark Twain realized what was happening he was on a cot
and escorted by the heads of two legations was on his way to the
hospital to get the precious interview Once there Anson Burlingame
with his gentle manner and courtly presence drew from those enfeebled
castaways all the story of the burning of the vessel followed by the
long privation and struggle that had lasted through fortythree fearful
days and across four thousand miles of stormy sea All that Mark Twain
had to do was to listen and make notes That night he wrote against
time and next morning just as the vessel was drifting from the dock a
strong hand flung his bulky manuscript aboard and his great beat was
sure The threecolumn story published in the Sacramento Union of
July 9 gave the public the first detailed history of the great disaster
The telegraph carried it everywhere and it was featured as a sensation

Mark Twain and the Burlingame party were much together during the rest of
their stay in Hawaii and Samuel Clemens never ceased to love and honor
the memory of Anson Burlingame It was proper that he should do so for
he owed him muchfar more than has already been told

Anson Burlingame one day said to him You have great ability I believe
you have genius What you need now is the refinement of association
Seek companionship among men of superior intellect and character Refine
yourself and your work Never affiliate with inferiors always climb

This coming to him from a man of Burlingames character and position
was like a gospel from some divine source Clemens never forgot the
advice It gave him courage new hope new resolve new ideals

Burlingame came often to the hotel and they discussed plans for Mark
Twains future The diplomat invited the journalist to visit him in
China

Come to Pekin he said and make my house your home

Young Burlingame also came when the patient became convalescent and
suggested walks Once when Clemens hesitated the young man said

But there is a scriptural command for you to go

If you can quote one Ill obey said Clemens

Very well the Bible says If any man require thee to walk a mile go
with him Twain

The walk was taken

Mark Twain returned to California at the end of July and went down to
Sacramento It was agreed that a special bill should be made for the
Hornet report

How much do you think it ought to be Mark asked one of the
proprietors

Clemens said Oh Im a modest man I dont want the whole Union
office call it a hundred dollars a column

There was a general laugh The bill was made out at that figure and he
took it to the office for payment

The cashier didnt faint he wrote many years later but he came
rather near it He sent for the proprietors and they only laughed in
their jolly fashion and said it was robbery but no matter pay it
Its all right The best men that ever owned a paper 6

MARK TWAIN LECTURER

In spite of the success of his Sandwich Island letters Samuel Clemens
felt on his return to San Francisco that his future was not bright He
was not a good allround newspaper manhe was special correspondent and
sketchwriter out of a job

He had a number of plans but they did not promise much One idea was to
make a book from his Hawaiian material Another was to write magazine
articles beginning with one on the Hornet disaster He did in fact
write the Hornet article and its prompt acceptance by Harpers
Magazine delighted him for it seemed a start in the right direction A
third plan was to lecture on the islands

This prospect frightened him He had succeeded in his Third House
address of two years before but then he had lectured without charge and
for a church benefit This would be a different matter

One of the proprietors of a San Francisco paper Col John McComb of the
Alta California was strong in his approval of the lecture idea

Do it by all means he said Take the largest house in the city and
charge a dollar a ticket

Without waiting until his fright came back Mark Twain hurried to the
manager of the Academy of Music and engaged it for a lecture to be given
October 2d 1866 and sat down and wrote his announcement He began by
stating what he would speak upon and ended with a few absurdities such
as

 A SPLENDID ORCHESTRA
 is in town but has not been engaged

 Also
 A DEN OF FEROCIOUS WILD BEASTS
 will be on exhibition in the next block
 A GRAND TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
 may be expected in fact the public are privileged to
 expect whatever they please
 Doors open at 7 oclock The trouble to begin at 8 oclock

Mark Twain was well known in San Francisco and was pretty sure to have a
good house But he did not realize this and as the evening approached
his dread of failure increased Arriving at the theater he entered by
the stage door half expecting to find the place empty Then suddenly
he became more frightened than ever peering from the wings he saw that
the house was jammedpacked from the footlights to the walls
Terrified his knees shaking his tongue dry he managed to emerge and
was greeted with a roar a crash of applause that nearly finished him
Only for an instantreaction followed these people were his friends
and he was talking to them He forgot to be afraid and as the applause
came in great billows that rose ever higher he felt himself borne with
it as on a tide of happiness and success His evening from beginning to
end was a complete triumph Friends declared that for descriptive
eloquence humor and real entertainment nothing like his address had
ever been delivered The morning papers were enthusiastic

Mark Twain no longer hesitated as to what he should do now He would
lecture The book idea no longer attracted him the appearance of the
Hornet article signed through a printers error Mark Swain cooled
his desire to be a magazine contributor No matterlecturing was the
thing Dennis McCarthy who had sold his interest in the Enterprise
was in San Francisco Clemens engaged this honest happyhearted
Irishman as manager and the two toured California and Nevada with
continuous success

Those who remember Mark Twain as a lecturer in that early day say that on
entering he would lounge loosely across the platform his manuscript
written on wrappingpaper and carried under his armlooking like a
ruffled hen His delivery they recall as being even more quaint and
drawling than in later life Once when his lecture was over an old man
came up to him and said

Be them your natural tones of eloquence

In those days it was thought proper that a lecturer should be introduced
and Clemens himself used to tell of being presented by an old miner who
said

Ladies and gentlemen I know only two things about this man the first
is that hes never been in jail and the second is I dont know why

When he reached Virginia his old friend Goodman said Sam you dont
need anybody to introduce you and he suggested a novel plan That
night when the curtain rose it showed Mark Twain seated at a piano
playing and singing as if still cub pilot on the John J Roe

 Had an old horse whose name was Methusalem
 Took him down and sold him in Jerusalem
 A long time ago

Pretending to be surprised and startled at the burst of applause he
sprang up and began to talk How the audience enjoyed it

Mark Twain continued his lecture tour into December and then on the
15th of that month sailed by way of the Isthmus of Panama for New York
He had made some money and was going home to see his people He had
planned to make a trip around the world later contributing a series of
letters to the Alta California lecturing where opportunity afforded
He had been on the Coast five and a half years and to his professions of
printing and piloting had added three othersmining journalism and
lecturing Also he had acquired a measure of fame He could come back
to his people with a good account of his absence and a good heart for the
future

But it seems now only a chance that he arrived at all Crossing the
Isthmus he embarked for New York on what proved to be a cholera ship
For a time there were one or more funerals daily An entry in his diary
says

 Since the last two hours all laughter all levity has ceased on the
 shipa settled gloom is upon the faces of the passengers

 But the winter air of the North checked the contagion and there
 were no new cases when New York City was reached

Clemens remained but a short time in New York and was presently in St
Louis with his mother and sister They thought he looked old but he had
not changed in manner and the gay banter between mother and son was soon
as lively as ever He was thirtyone now and she sixtyfour but the
years had made little difference She petted him joked with him and
scolded him In turn he petted and comforted and teased her She
decided he was the same Sam and always would bea true prophecy

He visited Hannibal and lectured there receiving an ovation that would
have satisfied even Tom Sawyer In Keokuk he lectured again then
returned to St Louis to plan his trip around the world

He was not to make a trip around the world howevernot then In St
Louis he saw the notice of the great Quaker City Holy Land excursion
the first excursion of the kind ever plannedand was greatly taken with
the idea Impulsive as always he wrote at once to the Alta
California proposing that they send him as their correspondent on this
grand ocean picnic The cost of passage was 1200 and the Alta
hesitated but Colonel McComb already mentioned assured his associates
that the investment would be sound The Alta wrote accepting Mark
Twains proposal and agreed to pay twenty dollars each for letters
Clemens hurried to New York to secure a berth fearing the passengerlist
might be full Furthermore with no one of distinction to vouch for him
according to advertised requirements he was not sure of being accepted
Arriving in New York he learned from an Alta representative that
passage had already been reserved for him but he still doubted his
acceptance as one of the distinguished advertised company His mind was
presently relieved on this point Waiting his turn at the bookingdesk
he heard a newspaper man inquire

What notables are going

A clerk with evident pride rattled off the names

LieutenantGeneral Sherman Henry Ward Beecher and Mark Twain also
probably General Banks

It was very pleasant to hear the clerk say that Not only was he
accepted but billed as an attraction

The Quaker City would not sail for two months yet and during the
period of waiting Mark Twain was far from idle He wrote New York
letters to the Alta and he embarked in two rather important ventures
he published his first book and he delivered a lecture in New York City

Both these undertakings were planned and carried out by friends from the
Coast Charles Henry Webb who had given up his magazine to come East
had collected The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and Other
Sketches and after trying in vain to find a publisher for them
brought them out himself on the 1st of May 18677 It seems curious
now that any publisher should have declined the little volume for the
sketches especially the frog story had been successful and there was
little enough good American humor in print However publishing was a
matter not lightly undertaken in those days

Mark Twain seems to have been rather pleased with the appearance of his
first book To Bret Harte he wrote

The book is out and is handsome It is full of    errorsbut be a
friend and say nothing about those things When my hurry is over I will
send you a copy to pizen the children with

The little clothandgold volume so valued by bookcollectors today
contained the frog story and twentysix other sketches some of which are
still preserved in Mark Twains collected works Most of them were not
Mark Twains best literature but they were fresh and readable and suited
the taste of that period The book sold very well and while it did not
bring either great fame or fortune to its author it was by no means a
failure

The hurry mentioned in Mark Twains letter to Bret Harte related to his
second venturethat is to say his New York lecture an enterprise
managed by an old Comstock friend Frank Fuller exGovernor of Utah
Fuller always a sanguine and energetic person had proposed the lecture
idea as soon as Mark Twain arrived in New York Clemens shook his head

I have no reputation with the general public here he said We
couldnt get a bakers dozen to hear me

But Fuller insisted and eventually engaged the largest hall in New York
the Cooper Union Full of enthusiasm and excitement he plunged into the
business of announcing and advertising his attraction and inventing
schemes for the sale of seats Clemens caught Fullers enthusiasm by
spells but between times he was deeply depressed Fuller had got up a
lot of tiny handbills and had arranged to hang bunches of these in the
horsecars The little dangling clusters fascinated Clemens and he rode
about to see if anybody else noticed them Finally after a long time a
passenger pulled off one of the bills and glanced at it A man with him
asked

Whos Mark Twain

Goodness knows I dont

The lecturer could not ride any farther He hunted up his patron

Fuller he groaned there isnt a signa ripple of interest

Fuller assured him that things were working underneath and would be
all right But Clemens wrote home Everything looks shady at least if
not dark And he added that after hiring the largest house in New
York he must play against Schuyler Colfax Ristori and a double troupe
of Japanese jugglers at other places of amusement

When the evening of the lecture approached and only a few tickets had
been sold the lecturer was desperate

Fuller he said therell be nobody in Cooper Union that night but you
and me I am on the verge of suicide I would commit suicide if I had
the pluck and the outfit You must paper the house Fuller You must
send out a flood of complimentaries

Very well said Fuller What we want this time is reputation anyway
money is secondary Ill put you before the choicest and most
intelligent audience that was ever gathered in New York City

Fuller immediately sent out complimentary tickets to the schoolteachers
of New York and Brooklyna general invitation to come and hear Mark
Twains great lecture on the Sandwich Islands There was nothing to do
after that but wait results

Mark Twain had lost faithhe did not believe anybody in New York would
come to hear him even on a free ticket When the night arrived he drove
with Fuller to the Cooper Union half an hour before the lecture was to
begin Forty years later he said

 I couldnt keep away I wanted to see that vast Mammoth Cave and
 die But when we got near the building I saw all the streets were
 blocked with people and that traffic had stopped I couldnt
 believe that these people were trying to get to the Cooper
 Institutebut they were and when I got to the stage at last the
 house was jammed fullpacked there wasnt room enough left for a
 child

 I was happy and I was excited beyond expression I poured the
 Sandwich Islands out on those people and they laughed and shouted
 to my entire content For an hour and fifteen minutes I was in
 paradise

So in its way this venture was a success It brought Mark Twain a good
deal of a reputation in New York even if no financial profit though in
spite of the flood of complimentaries there was a cash return of
something like three hundred dollars This went a good way toward paying
the expenses while Fuller in his royal way insisted on making up the
deficit declaring he had been paid for everything in the fun and joy of
the game

Mark he said its all right The fortune didnt come but it will
The fame has arrived with this lecture and your book just out you are
going to be the mosttalkedof man in the country Your letters to the
Alta and the Tribune will get the widest reception of any letters of
travel ever written




XXVII

AN INNOCENT ABROAD AND HOME AGAIN

It was early in Maythe 6ththat Mark Twain had delivered his Cooper
Union lecture and a month later June 8 1867 he sailed on the Quaker
City with some sixtysix other pilgrims on the great Holy Land
excursion the story of which has been so fully and faithfully told in
The Innocent Abroad

What a wonderful thing it must have seemed in that time for a party of
excursionists to have a ship all to themselves to go agipsying in from
port to port of antiquity and romance The advertised celebrities did
not go none of them but Mark Twain but no one minded presently for
Mark Twains sayings and stories kept the company sufficiently
entertained and sometimes he would read aloud to his fellowpassengers
from the newspaper letters he was writing and invite comment and
criticism That was entertainment for them and it was good for him for
it gave him an immediate audience always inspiring to an author
Furthermore the comments offered were often of the greatest value
especially suggestions from one Mrs Fairbanks of Cleveland a
middleaged cultured woman herself a correspondent for her husbands
paper the Herald It requires not many days for acquaintances to form
on shipboard and in due time a little group gathered regularly each
afternoon to hear Mark Twain read what he had written of their days
doings though some of it he destroyed later because Mrs Fairbanks
thought it not his best

All of the pilgrims mentioned in The Innocents Abroad were real
persons Dan was Dan Slote Mark Twains roommate the Doctor who
confused the guides was Dr A Reeves Jackson of Chicago the poet
Lariat was Bloodgood H Cutter an eccentric from Long Island Jack was
Jack Van Nostrand of New Jersey and Moult and Blucher and Charlie
were likewise real the last named being Charles J Langdon of Elmira
N Y a boy of eighteen whose sister would one day become Mark Twains
wife

It has been said that Mark Twain first met Olivia Langdon on the Quaker
City but this is not quite true he met only her picturethe original
was not on that ship Charlie Langdon boy fashion made a sort of hero
of the brilliant man called Mark Twain and one day in the Bay of Smyrna
invited him to his cabin and exhibited his treasures among them a dainty
miniature of a sister at home Olivia a sweet delicate creature whom
the boy worshiped

Samuel Clemens gazed long at the exquisite portrait and spoke of it
reverently for in the sweet face he seemed to find something spiritual
Often after that he came to young Langdons cabin to look at the pictured
countenance in his heart dreaming of a day when he might learn to know
its owner

We need not follow in detail here the travels of the pilgrims and their
adventures Most of them have been fully set down in The Innocents
Abroad and with not much elaboration for plenty of amusing things were
happening on a trip of that kind and Mark Twains old notebooks are
full of the real incidents that we find changed but little in the book
If the adventures of Jack Dan and the Doctor are embroidered here and
there the truth is always there too

Yet the old notebooks have a very intimate interest of their own It is
curious to be looking through them today trying to realize that those
penciled memoranda were the fresh first impressions that would presently
grow into the worlds most delightful book of travel that they were set
down in the very midst of that historic little company that frolicked
through Italy and climbed wearily the arid Syrian hills

It required five months for the Quaker City to make the circuit of the
Mediterranean and return to New York Mark Twain in that time
contributed fifty two or three letters to the Alta California and six
to the New York Tribune or an average of nearly three a weeka vast
amount of labor to be done in the midst of sightseeing And what
letters of travel they were The most remarkable that had been written
up to that time Vivid fearless full of fresh color humor poetry
they came as a revelation to a public weary of the tiresome descriptive
drivel of that day They preached a new gospel in travel literaturethe
gospel of seeing honestly and speaking franklya gospel that Mark Twain
would continue to preach during the rest of his career

Furthermore the letters showed a great literary growth in their author
No doubt the cultivated associations of the ship the afternoon reading
aloud of his work and Mrs Fairbankss advice had much to do with this
But we may believe also that the authors close study of the King James
version of the Old Testament during the weeks of travel through Palestine
exerted a powerful influence upon his style The man who had recited
The Burial of Moses to Joe Goodman with so much feeling could not
fail to be mastered by the simple yet stately Bible phrase and imagery
Many of the fine descriptive passages in The Innocents Abroad have
something almost Biblical in their phrasing The writer of this memoir
heard in childhood The Innocents Abroad read aloud and has never
forgotten the poetic spell that fell upon him as he listened to a
paragraph written of Tangier

 Here is a crumbled wall that was old when Columbus discovered
 America old when Peter the Hermit roused the knightly men of the
 Middle Ages to arm for the first Crusade old when Charlemagne and
 his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants
 and genii in the fabled days of the olden time old when Christ and
 His disciples walked the earth stood where it stands today when
 the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets
 of ancient Thebes

Mark Twain returned to America to find himself if not famous at least
in very high repute The Alta and Tribune letters had carried his
name to every corner of his native land He was in demand now To his
mother he wrote

 I have eighteen offers to lecture at 100 each in various parts of
 the Unionhave declined them all     Belong on the
 Tribune staff and shall write occasionally Am offered the same
 berth today on the Herald by letter

He was in Washington at this time having remained in New York but one
day He had accepted a secretaryship from Senator Stewart of Nevada but
this arrangement was a brief one He required fuller freedom for his
Washington correspondence and general literary undertakings

He had been in Washington but a few days when he received a letter that
meant more to him than he could possibly have dreamed at the moment It
was from Elisha Bliss Jr manager of the American Publishing Company
of Hartford Connecticut and it suggested gathering the Mediterranean
travelletters into a book Bliss was a capable energetic man with a
taste for humor and believed there was money for author and publisher in
the travelbook

The proposition pleased Mark Twain who replied at once asking for
further details as to Blisss plan Somewhat later he made a trip to
Hartford and the terms for the publication of The Innocents Abroad
were agreed upon It was to be a large illustrated book for subscription
sale and the author was to receive five per cent of the selling price
Bliss had offered him the choice between this royalty and ten thousand
dollars cash Though much tempted by the large sum to be paid in hand
Mark Twain decided in favor of the royalty planthe best business
judgment I ever displayed he used to say afterward He agreed to
arrange the letters for book publication revising and rewriting where
necessary and went back to Washington well pleased He did not realize
that his agreement with Bliss marked the beginning of one of the most
notable publishing connections in American literary history

OLIVIA LANGDON WORK ON THE INNOCENTS

Certainly this was a momentous period in Mark Twains life It was a
time of great events and among them was one which presently would come
to mean more to him than all the restthe beginning of his acquaintance
with Olivia Langdon

One evening in late December when Samuel Clemens had come to New York to
visit his old Quaker City roommate Dan Slote he found there other
ship comrades including Jack Van Nostrand and Charlie Langdon It was a
joyful occasion but one still happier followed it Young Langdons
father and sister Olivia were in New York and an evening or two later
the boy invited his distinguished Quaker City shipmate to dine with
them at the old St Nicholas Hotel We may believe that Samuel Clemens
went willingly enough He had never forgotten the September day in the
Bay of Smyrna when he had first seen the sweetfaced miniaturenow at
last he looked upon the reality

Long afterward he said It was forty years ago From that day to this
she has never been out of my mind

Charles Dickens gave a reading that night at Steinway Hall The Langdons
attended and Samuel Clemens with them He recalled long after that
Dickens wore a black velvet coat with a fieryred flower in his
buttonhole and that he read the storm scene from David Copperfield
the death of James Steerforth but he remembered still more clearly the
face and dress and the slender girlish figure of Olivia Langdon at his
side

Olivia Langdon was twentytwo years old at this time delicate as the
miniature he had seen though no longer in the fragile health of her
girlhood Gentle winning lovable she was the family idol and Samuel
Clemens was no less her worshiper from the first moment of their meeting

Miss Langdon on her part was at first rather dazed by the strange
brilliant handsome man so unlike anything she had known before When
he had gone she had the feeling that something like a great meteor had
crossed her sky To her brother who was eager for her good opinion of
his celebrity she admitted her admiration if not her entire approval
Her father had no doubts With a keen sense of humor and a deep
knowledge of men Jervis Langdon was from that first evening the devoted
champion of Mark Twain Clemens saw Miss Langdon again during the
holidays and by the weeks end he had planned to visit Elmirasoon
But fate managed differently He was not to see Elmira for the better
part of a year

He returned to his work in Washingtonthe preparation of the book and
his newspaper correspondence It was in connection with the latter that
he first met General Grant then not yet President The incident
characteristic of both men is worth remembering Mark Twain had called
by permission elated with the prospect of an interview But when he
looked into the square smileless face of the soldier he found himself
for the first time in his life without anything particular to say
Grant nodded slightly and waited His caller wished something would
happen It did His inspiration returned

General he said I seem to be slightly embarrassed Are you

Grants severity broke up in laughter There were no further
difficulties

Work on the book did not go so well There were many distractions in
Washington and Clemens did not like the climate there Then he found
the Alta had copyrighted his letters and were reluctant to allow him to
use them He decided to sail at once for San Francisco If he could
arrange the Alta matter he would finish his work there He did in
fact carry out this plan and all difficulties vanished on his arrival
His old friend Colonel McComb obtained for him free use of the Alta
letters The way was now clear for his book His immediate need of
funds however induced him to lecture In May he wrote Bliss

 I lectured here on the trip the Quaker City excursion the other
 night 1600 in gold in the house every seat taken and paid for
 before night

He settled down to work now with his usual energy editing and rewriting
and in two months had the big manuscript ready for delivery

Mark Twains friends urged him to delay his return to the States long
enough to make a lecture tour through California and Nevada He must
give his new lecture they told him to his old friends He agreed and
was received at Virginia City Carson and elsewhere like a returning
conqueror He lectured again in San Francisco just before sailing

The announcement of his lecture was highly original It was a handbill
supposed to have been issued by the foremost citizens of San Francisco a
mock protest against his lecture urging him to return to New York
without inflicting himself on them again On the same bill was printed
his reply In it he said

 I will torment the people if I want to It only costs them 1
 apiece and if they cant stand it what do they stay here for

He promised positively to sail on July 6th if they would let him talk
just this once

There was a good deal more of this drollery on the bill which ended with
the announcement that he would appear at the Mercantile Library on July
2d It is unnecessary to say that the place was jammed on that evening
It was probably the greatest lecture event San Francisco has ever known
Four days later July 6 1868 Mark Twain sailed via Aspinwall for New
York and on the 28th delivered the manuscript of The Innocents Abroad
or the New Pilgrims Progress to his Hartford publisher

THE VISIT TO ELMIRA AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

Samuel Clemens now decided to pay his longdeferred visit to the Langdon
home in Elmira Through Charlie Langdon he got the invitation renewed
and for a glorious week enjoyed the generous hospitality of the beautiful
Langdon home and the society of fair Olivia LangdonLivy as they called
herrealizing more and more that for him there could never be any other
woman in the world He spoke no word of this to her but on the morning
of the day when his visit would end he relieved himself to Charlie
Langdon much to the young mans alarm Greatly as he admired Mark Twain
himself he did not think him or indeed any man good enough for
Livy whom he considered little short of a saint Clemens was to take
a train that evening but young Langdon said when he recovered

Look here Clemens theres a train in half an hour Ill help you
catch it Dont wait until tonight go now

Mark Twain shook his head

No Charlie he said in his gentle drawl I want to enjoy your
hospitality a little longer I promise to be circumspect and Ill go
tonight

That night after dinner when it was time to take the train a light
twoseated wagon was at the gate Young Langdon and his guest took the
back seat which for some reason had not been locked in its place The
horse started with a quick forward spring and the seat with its two
occupants described a circle and landed with force on the cobbled street

Neither passenger was seriously hurtonly dazed a little for the moment
But to Mark Twain there came a sudden inspiration Here was a chance to
prolong his visit When the Langdon household gathered with
restoratives he did not recover at once and allowed himself to be
supported to an armchair for further remedies Livy Langdon showed
especial anxiety

He was not allowed to go now of course he must stay until it was
certain that his recovery was complete Perhaps he had been internally
injured His visit was prolonged two weeks two weeks of pure happiness
and when he went away he had fully resolved to win Livy Langdon for his
wife

Mark Twain now went to Hartford to look after his book proofs and there
for the first time met the Rev Joseph H Twichell who would become his
closest friend The two men so different in many ways always had the
fondest admiration for each other each recognized in the other great
courage humanity and sympathy Clemens would gladly have remained in
Hartford that winter Twichell presented him to many congenial people
including Charles Dudley Warner Harriet Beecher Stowe and other writing
folk But flattering lecture offers were made him and he could no
longer refuse

He called his new lecture The Vandal Abroad it being chapters from the
forthcoming book and it was a great success everywhere His houses were
crowded the newspapers were enthusiastic His delivery was described as
a long monotonous drawl with fun invariably coming in at the end of a
sentenceafter a pause He began to be recognized everywhereto have
great popularity People came out on the street to see him pass

Many of his lecture engagements were in central New York no great
distance from Elmira He had a standing invitation to visit the Langdon
home and went when he could His courtship however was not entirely
smooth Much as Mr Langdon honored his gifts and admired him
personally he feared that his daughter who had known so little of life
and the outside world and the brilliant traveler lecturer author
might not find happiness in marriage Many absurd stories have been told
of Mark Twains first interview with Jervis Langdon on this subject but
these are without foundation It was an earnest discussion on both
sides and left Samuel Clemens rather crestfallen though not without
hope More than once the subject was discussed between the two men that
winter as the lecturer came and went his fame always growing In time
the Langdon household had grown to feel that he belonged to them It
would be only a step further to make him really one of the family

There was no positive engagement at first for it was agreed between
Clemens and Jervis Langdon that letters should be sent by Mr Langdon to
those who had known his wouldbe soninlaw earlier with inquiries as to
his past conduct and general character It was a good while till answers
to these came and when they arrived Samuel Clemens was on hand to learn
the result Mr Langdon had a rather solemn look when they were alone
together

Clemens asked Youve heard from those gentlemen out there

Yes and from another gentlemen I wrote to concerning you

They dont appear to have been very enthusiastic from your manner

Well yes some of them were

I suppose I may ask what particular form their emotion took

Oh yes yes they agree unanimously that you are a brilliant able man
a man with a future and that you would make about the worst husband on
record

The applicant had a forlorn look There is nothing very evasive about
that he said

Langdon reflected

Havent you any other friend that you could suggest

Apparently none whose testimony would be valuable

Jervis Langdon held out his hand

You have at least one he said I believe in you I know you better
then they do

The engagement of Samuel Langhorne Clemens and Olivia Lewis Langdon was
ratified next day February 4 1869 To Jane Clemens her son wrote
She is a little body but she hasnt her peer in Christendom




XXX

THE NEW BOOK AND A WEDDING

Clemens closed his lecture tour in March with a profit of something more
than eight thousand dollars He had intended to make a spring tour of
California but went to Elmira instead The revised proofs of his book
were coming now and he and gentle Livy Langdon read them together
Samuel Clemens realized presently that the girl he had chosen had a
delicate literary judgment She became all at once his editor a
position she held until her death Her refining influence had much to do
with Mark Twains success then and later and the world owes her a debt
of gratitude Through that first pleasant summer these two worked at the
proofs and planned for their future and were very happy indeed

It was about the end of July when the big book appeared at last and its
success was startling Nothing like it had ever been known before Mark
Twains name seemed suddenly to be on every tonguehis book in
everybodys hands From one end of the country to the other readers
were hailing him as the greatest humorist and descriptive writer of
modern times By the first of the year more than thirty thousand volumes
had been sold It was a book of travel its lowest price was three and a
half dollars the record has not been equaled since In England also
large editions had been issued and translations into foreign languages
were under way It was and is a great book because it is a human book
a book written straight from the heart

If Mark Twain had not been famous before he was so now Indeed it is
doubtful if any other American author was so widely known and read as the
author of The Innocents Abroad during that first halfyear after its
publication

Yet for some reason he still did not regard himself as a literary man
He was a journalist and began to look about for a paper which he could
buyhis idea being to establish a business and a home Through Mr
Langdons assistance he finally obtained an interest in the Buffalo
Express and the end of the year 1869 found him established as its
associate editor though still lecturing here and there because his
weddingday was near at hand and there must be no lack of funds

It was the 2d of February 1870 that Samuel Clemens and Olivia Langdon
were married A few days before he sat down one night and wrote to
Jim Gillis away out in the Tuolumne Hills and told him of all his good
fortune recalling their days at Angels Camp and the absurd frog story
which he said had been the beginning of his happiness In the five years
since then he had traveled a long way but he had not forgotten

On the morning of his weddingday Mark Twain received from his publisher
a check for four thousand dollars his profit from three months sales of
the book a handsome sum

The wedding was mainly a family affair Twichell and his wife came over
from HartfordTwichell to assist Thomas K Beecher in performing the
ceremony Jane Clemens could not come nor Orion and his wife but
Pamela a widow now and her daughter Annie grown to a young lady
arrived from St Louis Not more than one hundred guests gathered in the
stately Langdon parlors that in future would hold so much history for
Samuel Clemens and Olivia Langdonso much of the story of life and death
that thus made its beginning there Then at seven in the evening they
were married and the bride danced with her father and the Rev Thomas
Beecher declared she wore the longest gloves he had ever seen

It was the next afternoon that the weddingparty set out for Buffalo
Through a Mr Slee an agent of Mr Langdons Clemens had engaged as he
supposed a boardinghouse quiet and unpretentious for he meant to
start his married life modestly Jervis Langdon had a plan of his own
for his daughter but Clemens had received no inkling of it and had full
faith in the letter which Slee had written saying that a choice and
inexpensive boardinghouse had been secured When about nine oclock
that night the party reached Buffalo they found Mr Slee waiting at the
station There was snow and sleighs had been ordered Soon after
starting the sleigh of the bride and groom fell behind and drove about
rather aimlessly apparently going nowhere in particular This disturbed
the groom who thought they should arrive first and receive their guests
He criticized Slee for selecting a house that was so hard to find and
when they turned at last into Delaware Avenue Buffalos finest street
and stopped before a handsome house he was troubled concerning the
richness of the locality

They were on the steps when the door opened and a perfect fairyland of
lights and decoration was revealed within The friends who had gone
ahead came out with greetings to lead in the bride and groom Servants
hurried forward to take bags and wraps They were ushered inside they
were led through beautiful rooms all newly appointed and garnished The
bridegroom was dazed unable to understand the meaning of it allthe
completeness of their possession At last his young wife put her hand
upon his arm

Dont you understand Youth she saidthat was always her name for
him Dont you understand It is ours all ourseverythinga gift
from father

But still he could not quite grasp it and Mr Langdon brought a little
box and opening it handed them the deeds

Nobody quite remembers what was the first remark that Samuel Clemens
made but either then or a little later he said

Mr Langdon whenever you are in Buffalo if its twice a year come
right here Bring your bag and stay overnight if you want to It
shant cost you a cent




XXXI

MARK TWAIN IN BUFFALO

Mark Twain remained less than two years in Buffaloa period of much
affliction

In the beginning prospects could hardly have been brighter His
beautiful home seemed perfect At the office he found work to his hand
and enjoyed it His coeditor J W Larned who sat across the table
from him used to tell later how Mark enjoyed his work as he went along
the humor of itfrequently laughing as some new absurdity came into his
mind He was not very regular in his arrivals but he worked long hours
and turned in a vast amount of copyskits sketches editorials and
comments of a varied sort Not all of it was humorous he would stop
work any time on an amusing sketch to attack some abuse or denounce an
injustice and he did it in scorching words that made offenders pause
Once when two practical jokers had sent in a marriage notice of persons
not even contemplating matrimony he wrote

 This deceit has been practised maliciously by a couple of men whose
 small souls will escape through their pores some day if they do not
 varnish their hides

In May he considerably increased his income by undertaking a department
called Memoranda for the new Galaxy magazine The outlook was now so
promising that to his lecture agent James Redpath he wrote

 DEAR RED Im not going to lecture any more forever Ive got
 things ciphered down to a fraction now I know just about what it
 will cost to live and I can make the money without lecturing
 Therefore old man count me out

And in a second letter

 I guess Im out of the field permanently Have got a lovely wife a
 lovely house bewitchingly furnished a lovely carriage and a
 coachman whose style and dignity are simply aweinspiring nothing
 less and Im making more money than necessary by considerable and
 therefore why crucify myself nightly on the platform The
 subscriber will have to be excused for the present season at
 least

The little household on Delaware Avenue was indeed a happy place during
those early months Neither Clemens nor his wife in those days cared
much for society preferring the comfort of their own home Once when a
new family moved into a house across the way they postponed calling until
they felt ashamed Clemens himself called first One Sunday morning he
noticed smoke pouring from an upper window of their neighbors house
The occupants seated on the veranda evidently did not suspect their
danger Clemens stepped across to the gate and bowing politely said

 My name is Clemens we ought to have called on you before and I
 beg your pardon for intruding now in this informal way but your
 house is on fire

It was at the moment when life seemed at its best that shadows gathered
Jervis Langdon had never accepted his soninlaws playful invitation to
bring his bag and stay overnight and now the time for it was past In
the spring his health gave way Mrs Clemens who adored him went to
Elmira to be at his bedside Three months of lingering illness brought
the end His death was a great blow to Mrs Clemens and the strain of
watching had been very hard Her own health never robust became poor
A girlhood friend who came to cheer her with a visit was taken down
with typhoid fever Another long period of anxiety and nursing ended
with the young womans death in the Clemens home

To Mark Twain and his wife it seemed that their bright days were over
The arrival of little Langdon Clemens in November brought happiness
but his delicate hold on life was so uncertain that the burden of anxiety
grew

Amid so many distractions Clemens found his work hard His Memoranda
department in the Galaxy must be filled and be bright and readable
His work at the office could not be neglected Then too he had made a
contract with Bliss for another book Roughing Itand he was trying to
get started on that

He began to chafe under the relentless demands of the magazine and
newspaper Finally he could stand it no longer He sold his interest in
the Express at a loss and gave up the Memoranda In the closing
number April 1871 he said

 For the last eight months with hardly an interval I have had for
 my fellows and comrades night and day doctors and watchers of the
 sick During these eight months death has taken two members of my
 home circle and malignantly threatened two others All this I have
 experienced yet all the time have been under contract to furnish
 humorous matter once a month for this magazine  To be a
 pirate on a low salary and with no share of the profits in the
 business used to be my idea of an uncomfortable occupation but I
 have other views now To be a monthly humorist in a cheerless time
 is drearier

AT WORK ON ROUGHING IT

The Clemens family now went to Elmira to Quarry Farma beautiful
hilltop place overlooking the river and the townthe home of Mrs
Clemenss sister Mrs Theodore Crane They did not expect to return to
Buffalo and the house there was offered for sale For them the sunlight
had gone out of it

Matters went better at Quarry Farm The invalids gained strength work
on the book progressed The Clemenses that year fell in love with the
place that was to mean so much to them in the many summers to come

Mark Twain was not altogether satisfied however with his writing He
was afraid it was not up to his literary standard His spirits were at
low ebb when his old first editor Joe Goodman came East and stopped off
at Elmira Clemens hurried him out to the farm and eagerly putting the
chapters of Roughing It into his hands asked him to read them
Goodman seated himself comfortably by a window while the author went
over to a table and pretended to write but was really watching Goodman
who read page after page solemnly and with great deliberation Presently
Mark Twain could stand it no longer He threw down his pen exclaiming

I knew it I knew it Ive been writing nothing but rot You have sat
there all this time reading without a smilebut I am not wholly to
blame I have been trying to write a funny book with dead people and
sickness everywhere Oh Joe I wish I could die myself

Mark said Goodman I was reading critically not for amusement and
so far as I have read and can judge this is one of the best things you
have ever written I have found it perfectly absorbing You are doing a
great book

That was enough Clemens knew that Goodman never spoke idly of such
matters The author of Roughing It was a changed manfull of
enthusiasm eager to go on He offered to pay Goodman a salary to stay
and furnish inspiration Goodman declined the salary but remained for
several weeks and during long walks which the two friends took over the
hills gave advice recalled good material and was a great help and
comfort In May Clemens wrote to Bliss that he had twelve hundred
manuscript pages of the new book written and was turning out from thirty
to sixtyfive per day He was in high spirits The family health had
improvedonce more prospects were bright He even allowed Redpath to
persuade him to lecture again during the coming season Selling his
share of the Express at a loss had left Mark Twain considerably in debt
and lecture profits would furnish the quickest means of payment

When the summer ended the Clemens family took up residence in Hartford
Connecticut in the fine old Hooker house on Forest Street Hartford
held many attractions for Mark Twain His publishers were located there
also it was the home of a distinguished group of writers and of the Rev
Joe Twichell Neither Clemens nor his wife had felt that they could
return to Buffalo The home there was soldits contents packed and
shipped They did not see it again

His book finished Mark Twain lectured pretty steadily that winter often
in the neighborhood of Boston which was lecture headquarters Mark
Twain enjoyed Boston In Redpaths office one could often meet and swap
stories with Josh Billings Henry W Shaw and Petroleum V Nasby David
R Lockewellknown humorists of that daywhile in the strictly
literary circle there were William Dean Howells Thomas Bailey Aldrich
Bret Harte who by this time had become famous and journeyed eastward
and others of their sort They were all young and eager and merry then
and they gathered at luncheons in snug corners and talked gaily far into
the dimness of winter afternoons Harte had been immediately accorded a
high place in the Boston group Mark Twain as a strictly literary man
was still regarded rather doubtfully by members of the older setthe
Brahmins as they were calledbut the young men already hailed him
joyfully reveling in the fine fearless humor of his writing his
wonderful talk his boundless humanity

IN ENGLAND

Mark Twain closed his lecture season in February 1872 and during the
same month his new book Roughing It came from the press He disliked
the lecture platform and he felt that he could now abandon it He had
made up his loss in Buffalo and something besides Furthermore the
advance sales on his book had been large

Roughing It in fact proved a very successful book Like The
Innocents Abroad it was the first of its kind fresh in its humor and
description true in its picture of the frontier life he had known In
three months forty thousand copies had been sold and now after more
than forty years it is still a popular book The life it describes is
all gonethe scenes are changed It is a record of a vanished timea
delightful historyas delightful today as ever

Eighteen hundred and seventytwo was an eventful year for Mark Twain In
March his second child a little girl whom they named Susy was born and
three months later the boy Langdon died He had never been really
strong and a heavy cold and diphtheria brought the end

Clemens did little work that summer He took his family to Saybrook
Connecticut for the sea air and near the end of August when Mrs
Clemens had regained strength and courage he sailed for England to
gather material for a book on English life and customs He felt very
friendly toward the English who had been highly appreciative of his
writings and he wished their better acquaintance He gave out no word
of the book idea and it seems unlikely that any one in England ever
suspected it He was there three months and beyond some notebook
memoranda made during the early weeks of his stay he wrote not a line
He was too delighted with everything to write a booka book of his kind
In letters home he declared the country to be as beautiful as fairyland
By all classes attentions were showered upon himhonors such as he had
never received even in America W D Howells writes8

 In England rank fashion and culture rejoiced in him Lord mayors
 lord chief justices and magnates of many kinds were his hosts he
 was desired in country houses and his bold genius captivated the
 favor of periodicals that spurned the rest of our nation

He could not make a booka humorous bookout of these people and their
country he was too fond of them

England fairly reveled in Mark Twain At one of the great banquets a
roll of the distinguished guests was called and the names properly
applauded Mark Twain busily engaged in low conversation with his
neighbor applauded without listening vigorously or mildly as the
others led Finally a name was followed by a great burst of long and
vehement clapping This must be some very great person indeed and Mark
Twain not to be outdone in his approval stoutly kept his hands going
when all others had finished

Whose name was that we were just applauding he asked of his neighbor

Mark Twains

But it was no matter they took it all as one of his jokes He was a
wonder and a delight to them Whatever he did or said was to them
supremely amusing When on one occasion a speaker humorously referred
to his American habit of carrying a cotton umbrella his reply that he
did so because it was the only kind of an umbrella that an Englishman
wouldnt steal was repeated all over England next day as one of the
finest examples of wit since the days of Swift

He returned to America at the end of November promising to come back and
lecture to them the following year

A NEW BOOK AND NEW ENGLISH TRIUMPHS

But if Mark Twain could find nothing to write of in England he found no
lack of material in America That winter in Hartford with Charles
Dudley Warner he wrote The Gilded Age The Warners were neighbors
and the families visited back and forth One night at dinner when the
two husbands were criticizing the novels their wives were reading the
wives suggested that their author husbands write a better one The
challenge was accepted On the spur of the moment Warner and Clemens
agreed that they would write a book together and began it immediately

Clemens had an idea already in mind It was to build a romance around
that lovable dreamer his mothers cousin James Lampton whom the reader
will recall from an earlier chapter Without delay he set to work and
soon completed the first three hundred and ninetynine pages of the new
story Warner came over and after listening to its reading went home
and took up the story In two months the novel was complete Warner
doing most of the romance Mark Twain the character parts Warners
portion was probably pure fiction but Mark Twains chapters were full of
history

Judge Hawkins and wife were Mark Twains father and mother Washington
Hawkins his brother Orion Their doings with those of James Lampton as
Colonel Sellers were of course elaborated but the story of the
Tennessee land as told in that book is very good history indeed Laura
Hawkins however was only real in the fact that she bore the name of
Samuel Clemenss old playmate The Gilded Age published later in the
year was well received and sold largely The character of Colonel
Sellers at once took a place among the great fiction characters of the
world and is probably the best known of any American creation His
watchword Theres millions in it became a byword

The Clemenses decided to build in Hartford They bought a plot of land
on Farmington Avenue in the literary neighborhood and engaged an
architect and builder By spring the new house was well under way and
matters progressing so favorably the owners decided to take a holiday
while the work was going on Clemens had been eager to show England to
his wife so taking little Sissy now a year old they sailed in May to
be gone half a year

They remained for a time in Londona period of honors and entertainment
If Mark Twain had been a lion on his first visit he was hardly less than
royalty now His rooms at the Langham Hotel were like a court The
nations most distinguished menamong them Robert Browning Sir John
Millais Lord Houghton and Sir Charles Dilkecame to pay their
respects Authors were calling constantly Charles Reade and Wilkie
Collins could not get enough of Mark Twain Reade proposed to join with
him in writing a novel as Warner had done Lewis Carroll did not call
being too timid but they met the author of Alice in Wonderland one
night at a dinner the shyest fullgrown man except Uncle Remiss I
ever saw Mark Twain once declared

Little Sissy and her father thrived on London life but it wore on Mrs
Clemens At the end of July they went quietly to Edinburgh and settled
at Veitchs Hotel on George Street The strain of London life had been
too much for Mrs Clemens and her health became poor Unacquainted in
Edinburgh Clemens only remembered that Dr John Brown author of Rab
and His Friends lived there Learning the address he walked around to
23 Rutland Street and made himself known Doctor Brown came forthwith
and Mrs Clemens seemed better from the moment of his arrival

The acquaintance did not end there For a month the author of Rab and
the little Clemens family were together daily Often they went with him
to make his round of visits He was always leaning out of the carriage
to look at dogs It was told of him that once when he suddenly put his
head from a carriage window he dropped back with a disappointed look

Who was it asked his companion Some one you know

No a dog I dont know

Dr John was beloved by everybody in Scotland and his story of Rab had
won him a worldwide following Children adored him Little Susy and he
were playmates and he named her Megalopis a Greek term suggested by
her great dark eyes

Mark Twain kept his promise to lecture to a London audience On the 13th
of October in the Queens Concert Rooms Hanover Square he gave Our
Fellow Savages of the Sandwich Islands The house was packed Clemens
was not introduced He appeared on the platform in evening dress
assuming the character of a manager announcing a disappointment Mr
Clemens he said had fully expected to be present He paused and loud
murmurs arose from the audience He lifted his hand and the noise
subsided Then he added I am happy to say that Mark Twain is present
and will now give his lecture The audience roared its approval

He continued his lectures at Hanover Square through the week and at no
time in his own country had he won such a complete triumph He was the
talk of the streets The papers were full of him The London Times
declared his lectures had only whetted the public appetite for more His
manager George Dolby formerly manager for Charles Dickens urged him
to remain and continue the course through the winter Clemens finally
agreed that he would take his family back to America and come back
himself within the month This plan he carried out Returning to
London he lectured steadily for two months in the big Hanover Square
rooms giving his Roughing It address and it was only toward the end
that his audience showed any sign of diminishing There is probably no
other such a lecture triumph on record

Mark Twain was at the pinnacle of his first glory thirtysix in full
health prosperous sought by the worlds greatest hailed in the highest
places almost as a king Tom Sawyers dreams of greatness had been all
too modest In its most dazzling moments his imagination had never led
him so far

It was at the end of January 1874 when Mark Twain returned to America
His reception abroad had increased his prestige at home Howells and
Aldrich came over from Boston to tell him what a great man he had become
to renew those Boston days of three years beforeto talk and talk of
all the things between the earth and sky And Twichell came in of
course and Warner and no one took account of time or hurried or
worried about anything at all

We had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round
wrote Howells long after and he tells how he and Aldrich were so
carried away with Clemenss success in subscription publication that on
the way back to Boston they planned a book to sell in that way It was
to be called Twelve Memorable Murders and they had made two or three
fortunes from it by the time they reached Boston

But the project ended there We never killed a single soul Howells
once confessed to the writer of this memoir

At Quarry Farm that summer Mark Twain began the writing of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer He had been planning for some time to set
down the story of those faroff days along the riverfront at Hannibal
with John Briggs Tom Blankenship and the rest of that graceless band
and now in the cool luxury of a little study which Mrs Crane had built
for him on the hillside he set himself to spin the fabric of his youth
The study was a delightful place to work It was octagonal in shape
with windows on all sides something like a pilothouse From any
direction the breeze could come and there were fine views To Twichell
he wrote

 It is a cozy nest and just room in it for a sofa table and three
 or four chairs and when the storm sweeps down the remote valley and
 the lightning flashes behind the hills beyond and the rain beats on
 the roof over my head imagine the luxury of it

He worked steadily there that summer He would begin mornings soon
after breakfast keeping at it until nearly dinnertime say until five
or after for it was not his habit to eat the midday meal Other members
of the family did not venture near the place if he was wanted urgently
a horn was blown His work finished he would light a cigar and
stepping lightly down the stone flight that led to the houselevel he
would find where the family had assembled and read to them his days
work Certainly those were golden days and the tale of Tom and Huck and
Joe Harper progressed To Dr John Brown in Scotland he wrote

 I have been writing fifty pages of manuscript a day on an average
 for some time now    and consequently have been so wrapped
 up in it and dead to everything else that I have fallen mighty short
 in letterwriting

But the inspiration of Tom and Huck gave out when the tale was half
finished or perhaps it gave way to a new interest News came one day
that a writer in San Francisco without permission had dramatized The
Gilded Age and that it was being played by John T Raymond an actor of
much power Mark Twain had himself planned to dramatize the character of
Colonel Sellers and had taken out dramatic copyright He promptly
stopped the California production then wrote the dramatist a friendly
letter and presently bought the play of him and set in to rewrite it
It proved a great success Raymond played it for several years Colonel
Sellers on the stage became fully as popular as in the book and very
profitable indeed

THE NEW HOME

The new home in Hartford was ready that autumnthe beautiful house
finished or nearly finished the handsome furnishings in place It was
a lovely spot There were trees and grassa green shady slope that
fell away to a quiet stream The house itself quite different from the
most of the houses of that day had many wings and balconies and toward
the back a great veranda that looked down the shaded slope The kitchen
was not at the back As Mark Twain was unlike any other man that ever
lived so his house was not like other houses When asked why he built
the kitchen toward the street he said

 So the servants can see the circus go by without running into the
 front yard

But this was probably his afterthought The kitchen wing extended toward
Farmington Avenue but it was a harmonious detail of the general plan

Many frequenters have tried to express the charm of Mark Twains
household Few have succeeded for it lay not in the house itself nor
in its furnishings beautiful as these things were but in the
personality of its occupantsthe daily round of their livesthe
atmosphere which they unconsciously created From its wide entrancehall
and tiny jewel like conservatory below to the billiardroom at the top
of the house it seemed perfectly appointed serenely ordered and full
of welcome The home of one of the most unusual and unaccountable
personalities in the world was filled with gentleness and peace It was
Mrs Clemens who was chiefly responsible She was no longer the
halftimid inexperienced girl he had married Association study and
travel had brought her knowledge and confidence When the great ones of
the world came to visit Americas most picturesque literary figure she
gave welcome to them and filled her place at his side with such sweet
grace that those who came to pay their dues to him often returned to pay
still greater devotion to his companion William Dean Howells so often a
visitor there once said to the writer

 Words cannot express Mrs Clemensher fineness her delicate
 wonderful tact And again She was not only a beautiful soul but
 a woman of singular intellectual power

There were always visitors in the Clemens home Above the mantel in the
library was written The ornament of a house is the friends that
frequent it and the Clemens home never lacked of those ornaments and
they were of the worlds best No distinguished person came to America
that did not pay a visit to Hartford and Mark Twain Generally it was
not merely a call but a stay of days The welcome was always genuine
the entertainment unstinted George Warner a close neighbor once said

 The Clemens house was the only one I have ever known where there
 was never any preoccupation in the evenings and where visitors were
 always welcome Clemens was the best kind of a host his evenings
 after dinner were an unending flow of stories

As for friends living near they usually came and went at will often
without the ceremony of knocking or formal leavetaking The two Warner
famines were among these the home of Charles Dudley Warner being only a
step away Dr and Mrs Harriet Beecher Stowe were also close neighbors
while the Twichell parsonage was not far They were all like one great
family of which Mark Twains home was the central gatheringplace

OLD TIMES SKETCHES AND TOM SAWYER

The Rev Joseph H Twichell and Mark Twain used to take many long walks
together and once they decided to walk from Hartford to Bostonabout
one hundred miles They decided to allow three days for the trip and
really started one morning with some luncheon in a basket and a little
bag of useful articles It was a bright brisk November day and they
succeeded in getting to Westford a distance of twentyeight miles that
evening But they were lame and footsore and next morning when they
had limped six miles or so farther Clemens telegraphed to Redpath

 We have made thirtyfive miles in less than five days This shows
 the thing can be done Shall finish now by rail Did you have any
 bets on us

He also telegraphed Howells that they were about to arrive in Boston and
they did in fact reach the Howells home about nine oclock and found
excellent companythe Cambridge setand a most welcome supper waiting
Clemens and Twichell were ravenous Clemens demanded food immediately
Howells writes

 I can see him now as he stood up in the midst of our friends with
 his head thrown back and in his hands a dish of those scalloped
 oysters without which no party in Cambridge was really a party
 exulting in the tale of his adventure which had abounded in the
 most original characters and amusing incidents at every mile of
 their progress

The pedestrians returned to Hartford a day or two laterby train It
was during another though less extended tour which Twichell and Clemens
made that fall that the latter got his idea for a Mississippi book
Howells had been pleading for something for the January Atlantic of
which he was now chief editor but thus far Mark Twains inspiration had
failed He wrote at last My head wont go but later the same day
he sent another hasty line

 I take back the remark that I cant write for the January number
 for Twichell and I have had a long walk in the woods and I got to
 telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory and
 grandeur as I saw them during four years from the pilothouse He
 said What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine I hadnt
 thought of that before Would you like a series of papers to run
 through three months or six or nineor about four months say

Howells wrote at once welcoming the idea Clemens forthwith sent the
first instalment of that marvelous series of river chapters which rank
today among the very best of his work As pictures of the vanished
Mississippi life they are so real so convincing so full of charm that
they can never grow old As long as any one reads of the Mississippi
they will look up those chapters of Mark Twains piloting days When the
first number appeared John Hay wrote

 It is perfect no more no less I dont see how you do it

The Old Times chapter ran through seven numbers of the Atlantic and
show Mark Twain at his very best They form now most of the early
chapters of Life on the Mississippi The remainder of that book was
added about seven years later

Those were busy literary days for Mark Twain Writing the river chapters
carried him back and hardly had he finished them when he took up the
neglected story of Tom and Huck and finished that under full steam
He at first thought of publishing it in the Atlantic but decided
against this plan He sent Howells the manuscript to read and received
the fullest praise Howells wrote

 It is altogether the best boys story I ever read It will be an
 immense success

Clemens however delayed publication He had another volume in pressa
collection of his sketchesamong them the Jumping Frog and others of
his California days The Jumping Frog had been translated into French
and in this book Mark Twain published the French version and then a
literal retranslation of his own which is one of the most amusing
features in the volume As an example the strangers remark I dont
see no pints about that frog thats any better than any other frog in
the literal retranslation becomes I no saw not that that frog had
nothing of better than each frog and Mark Twain parenthetically adds
If that isnt grammar gone to seed then I count myself no judge

Sketches New and Old went very well but the book had no such sale as
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which appeared a year later December
1876 From the date of its issue it took its place as foremost of
American stories of boy life a place that to this day it shares only
with Huck Finn Mark Twains own boy life in the little drowsy town of
Hannibal with John Briggs and Tom Blankenshiptheir adventures in and
about the cave and rivermade perfect material The story is full of
pure delight The camp on the island is a picture of boy heaven No boy
that reads it but longs for the woods and a campfire and some bacon
strips in the fryingpan It is all so thrillingly told and so vivid
We know certainly that it must all have happened The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer has taken a place side by side with Treasure Island

HOME PICTURES

Mark Twain was now regarded by many as the foremost American author
Certainly he was the most widely known As a national feature he rivaled
Niagara Falls No civilized spot on earth that his name had not reached
Letters merely addressed Mark Twain found their way to him Mark
Twain United States was a common superscription Mark Twain The
World also reached him without delay while Mark Twain Somewhere
and Mark Twain Anywhere in due time came to Hartford Mark Twain
God Knows Where likewise arrived promptly and in his reply he said
He did Then a letter addressed The Devil Knows Where also reached
him and he answered He did too Surely these were the farthermost
limits of fame

Countless anecdotes went the rounds of the press Among them was one
which happened to be true

Their near neighbor Mrs Harriet Beecher Stowe was leaving for Florida
one morning and Clemens ran over early to say goodby On his return
Mrs Clemens looked at him severely

Why Youth she said you havent on any collar and tie

He said nothing but went to his room wrapped up those items in a neat
package which he sent over by a servant to Mrs Stowe with the line

 Herewith receive a call from the rest of me

Mrs Stowe returned a witty note in which she said he had discovered a
new principlethat of making calls by instalments and asked whether in
extreme cases a man might not send his clothes and be himself excused

Most of his work Mark Twain did at Quarry Farm Each summer the family
there were two little girls now Susy and Clarawent to that lovely
place on the hilltop above Elmira where there were plenty of green
fields and cows and horses and appletrees a spot as wonderful to them
as John Quarless farm had been to their father so long ago All the
family loved Quarry Farm and Mark Twains work went more easily there
His winters were not suited to literary creationthere were too many
social events though onceit was the winter of 76he wrote a play
with Bret Harte who came to Hartford and stayed at the Clemens home
while the work was in progress It was a Chinese play Ah Sin and the
two had a hilarious time writing it though the result did not prove much
of a success with the public Mark Twain often tried playsone with
Howells among othersbut the Colonel Sellers play was his only success

Grand dinners trips to Boston and New York guests in his own home
occupied much of Mark Twains winter season His leisure he gave to his
children and to billiards He had a passion for the game and at any
hour of the day or night was likely to be found in the room at the top of
the house knocking the balls about alone or with any visitor that he had
enticed to that den He mostly received his callers there and impressed
them into the game If they could play well and good If not so much
the better he could beat them extravagantly and he took huge delight in
such contests Every Friday evening a party of billiard loversHartford
mengathered and played and told stories and smoked until the room
was blue Clemens never tired of the game He could play all night He
would stay until the last man dropped from sheer weariness and then go
on knocking the balls about alone

But many evenings at homeearly eveningshe gave to Susy and Clara
They had learned his gift as a romancer and demanded the most startling
inventions They would bring him a picture requiring him to fit a story
to it without a moments delay Once he was suddenly ordered by Clara to
make a story out of a plumber and a bawgunstictor which on the whole
was easier than some of their requirements Along the bookshelves were
ornaments and pictures A picture of a girl whom they called Emeline
was at one end and at the other a cat Every little while they
compelled him to make a story beginning with the cat and ending with
Emeline Always a new story and never the other way about The
literary path from the cat to Emeline was a perilous one but in time he
could have traveled it in his dreams




XXXIX

TRAMPING ABROAD

It was now going on ten years since the publication of The Innocents
Abroad and there was a demand for another Mark Twain book of travel
Clemens considered the matter and decided that a walkingtour in Europe
might furnish the material he wanted He spoke to his good friend the
Rev Joe Twichell and invited him to become his guest on such an
excursion because as he explained he thought he could dig material
enough out of Joe to make it a sound investment As a matter of fact
he loved Twichells companionship and was always inviting him to share
his journeysto Boston to Bermuda to Washingtonwherever interest or
fancy led him His plan now was to take the family to Germany in the
spring and let Twichell join them later for a summer tramp down through
the Black Forest and Switzerland Meantime the Clemens household took up
the study of German The children had a German nurseothers a German
teacher The household atmosphere became Teutonic Of course it all
amused Mark Twain as everything amused him but he was a good student
In a brief time he had a fair knowledge of everyday German and a
really surprising vocabulary The little family sailed in April 1878
and a few weeks later were settled in the Schloss Hotel on a hill above
Heidelberg overlooking the beautiful old castle the ancient town with
the Neckar winding down the hazy valleyas fair a view as there is in
all Germany

Clemens found a room for his work in a small house not far from the
hotel On the day of his arrival he had pointed out this house and said
he had decided to work therethat his room would be the middle one on
the third floor Mrs Clemens laughed and thought the occupants of the
house might be surprised when he came over to take possession They
amused themselves by watching his people and trying to make out what
they were like One day he went over that way and sure enough there
was a sign Furnished Rooms and the one he had pointed out from the
hotel was vacant It became his study forthwith

The travelers were delighted with their location To Howells Clemens
wrote

 Our bedroom has two great glass birdcages inclosed balconies one
 looking toward the Rhine Valley and sunset the other looking up the
 Neckar cul de sac and naturally we spent nearly all our time in
 these We have tables and chairs in them     It must have
 been a noble genius who devised this hotel Lord how blessed is
 the repose the tranquillity of this place Only two sounds the
 happy clamor of the birds in the groves and the muffled music of the
 Neckar tumbling over the opposing dikes It is no hardship to lie
 awake awhile nights for thin subdued roar has exactly the sound of
 a steady rain beating upon a roof It is so healing to the spirit
 and it bears up the thread of ones imaginings as the accompaniment
 bears up a song

Twichell was summoned for August and wrote back eagerly at the prospect

 Oh my Do you realize Mark what a symposium it is to be I do
 To begin with I am thoroughly tired and the rest will be worth
 everything To walk with you and talk with you for weeks together
 why its my dream of luxury

Meantime the struggle with the awful German language went on Rosa
the maid was required to speak to the children only in German though
little Clara at first would have none of it Susy two years older
tried and really made progress but one day she said pathetically

 Mama I wish Rosa was made in English

But presently she was writing to Aunt Sue Mrs Crane at Quarry Farm

 I know a lot of German everybody says I know a lot I give you a
 million dollars to see you and you would give two hundred dollars
 to see the lovely woods we see

Twichell arrived August 1st Clemens met him at BadenBaden and they
immediately set forth on a tramp through the Black Forest excursioning
as they pleased and having a blissful time They did not always walk
They were likely to take a carriage or a donkeycart or even a train
when one conveniently happened along They did not hurry but idled and
talked and gathered flowers or gossiped with wayside natives
picturesque peasants in the Black Forest costume In due time they
crossed into Switzerland and prepared to conquer the Alps

The name Mark Twain had become about as well known in Europe as it was in
America His face however was less familiar He was not often
recognized in these wanderings and his penname was carefully concealed
It was a relief to him not to be an object of curiosity and lavish
attention Twichells conscience now and then prompted him to reveal the
truth In one of his letters home he wrote how a young man at a hotel
had especially delighted in Marks table conversation and how he
Twichell had later taken the young man aside and divulged the speakers
identity

 I could not forbear telling him who Mark was and the mingled
 surprise and pleasure his face exhibited made me glad I had done so

They did not climb many of the Alps on foot They did scale the Rigi
after which Mark Twain was not in the best walking trim though later
they conquered Gemmi Passno small undertakingthat trail that winds up
and up until the traveler has only the glaciers and white peaks and the
little highblooming flowers for company

All day long the friends would tramp and walk together and when they did
not walk they would hire a diligence or any vehicle that came handy but
whatever their means of travel the joy of comradeship amid those superb
surroundings was the same

In Twichells letters home we get pleasant pictures of the Mark Twain of
that day

 Mark today was immensely absorbed in flowers He scrambled
 around and gathered a great variety and manifested the intensest
 pleasure in them     Mark is splendid to walk with amid such
 grand scenery for he talks so well about it has such a power of
 strong picturesque expression I wish you might have heard him
 today His vigorous speech nearly did justice to the things we saw

And in another place

 He cant bear to see the whip used or to see a horse pull hard
 Today when the driver clucked up his horse and quickened his pace a
 little Mark said The fellows got the notion that we were in a
 hurry

Another extract refers to an incident which Mark Twain also mentions in
A Tramp Abroad 8

 Mark is a queer fellow There is nothing so delights him as a
 swift strong stream You can hardly get him to leave one when once
 he is in the influence of its fascinations To throw in stones and
 sticks seems to afford him rapture

Twichell goes on to tell how he threw some driftwood into a racing
torrent and how Mark went running downstream after it waving and
shouting in a sort of mad ecstasy

When a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam below he
would jump up and down and yell He acted just like a boy

Boy he was then and always Like Peter Pan he never really grew up
that is if growing up means to grow solemn and uninterested in play

Climbing the Gorner Grat with Twichell they sat down to rest and a lamb
from a nearby flock ventured toward them Clemens held out his hand and
called softly The lamb ventured nearer curious but timid

It was a scene for a painter the great American humorist on one side of
the game and the silly little creature on the other with the Matterhorn
for a background Mark was reminded that the time he was consuming was
valuable but to no purpose The Gorner Grat could wait He held on
with undiscouraged perseverance till he carried his point the lamb
finally put its nose in Marks hand and he was happy all the rest of the
day

In A Tramp Abroad Mark Twain burlesques most of the walkingtour with
Harris Twichell feeling perhaps that he must make humor at whatever
cost But today the other side of the picture seems more worth while
That it seemed so to him also even at the time we may gather from a
letter he sent after Twichell when it was all over and Twichell was on
his way home

 DEAR OLD JOEIt is actually all over I was so lowspirited at
 the station yesterday and this morning when I woke I couldnt
 seem to accept the dismal truth that you were really gone and the
 pleasant tramping and talking at an end Ah my boy It has been
 such a rich holiday for me and I feel under such deep and honest
 obligations to you for coming I am putting out of my mind all
 memory of the time when I misbehaved toward you and hurt you I am
 resolved to consider it forgiven and to store up and remember only
 the charming hours of the journey and the times when I was not
 unworthy to be with you and share a companionship which to me stands
 first after Livys

Clemens had joined his family at Lausanne and presently they journeyed
down into Italy returning later to Germanyto Munich where they lived
quietly with Fraulein Dahlweiner at No 1a Karlstrasse while he worked
on his new book of travel When spring came they went to Paris and
later to London where the usual round of entertainment briefly claimed
them It was the 3d of September 1879 when they finally reached New
York The papers said that Mark Twain had changed in his year and a half
of absence He had somehow taken on a traveled look One paper
remarked that he looked older than when he went to Germany and that his
hair had turned quite gray

THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER

They went directly to Quarry Farm where Clemens again took up work on
his book which he hoped to have ready for early publication But his
writing did not go as well as he had hoped and it was long after they
had returned to Hartford that the book was finally in the printers
hands

Meantime he had renewed work on a story begun two years before at Quarry
Farm Browsing among the books there one summer day he happened to pick
up The Prince and the Page by Charlotte M Yonge It was a story of a
prince disguised as a blind beggar and as Mark Twain read an idea came
to him for an altogether different story or play of his own He would
have a prince and a pauper change places and through a series of
adventures learn each the trials and burdens of the other life He
presently gave up the play idea and began it as a story His first
intention had been to make the story quite modern using the late King
Edward VII then Prince of Wales as his prince but it seemed to him
that it would not do to lose a prince among the slums of modern London
he could not make it seem real so he followed back through history until
he came to the little son of Henry VIII Edward Tudor and decided that
he would do

It was the kind of a story that Mark Twain loved to read and to write
By the end of that first summer he had finished a good portion of the
exciting adventures of The Prince and the Pauper and then as was
likely to happen the inspiration waned and the manuscript was laid
aside

But with the completion of A Tramp Abroada task which had grown
wearisomehe turned to the luxury of romance with a glad heart To
Howells he wrote that he was taking so much pleasure in the writing that
he wanted to make it last

 Did I ever tell you the plot of it It begins at 9 AM January
 27 1547     My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the
 exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of
 their penalties upon the king himself and allowing him a chance to
 see the rest of them applied to others

Susy and Clara Clemens were old enough now to understand the story and
as he finished the chapters he read them aloud to his small home
audiencea most valuable audience indeed for he could judge from its
eager interest or lack of attention just the measure of his success

These little creatures knew all about the writing of books Susys
earliest recollection was Tom Sawyer read aloud from the manuscript
Also they knew about plays They could not remember a time when they did
not take part in evening charadesa favorite amusement in the Clemens
home

Mark Twain who always loved his home and played with his children
invented the charades and their parts for them at first but as they
grew older they did not need much help With the Twichell and Warner
children they organized a little company for their productions and
entertained the assembled households They did not make any preparation
for their parts A word was selected and the syllables of it whispered
to the little actors Then they withdrew to the hall where all sorts of
costumes had been laid out for the evening dressed their parts and each
group marched into the library performed its syllable and retired
leaving the audience of parents to guess the answer Now and then even
at this early day they gave little plays and of course Mark Twain could
not resist joining them In time the plays took the place of the
charades and became quite elaborate with a stage and scenery but we
shall hear of this later on

The Prince and the Pauper came to an end in due season in spite of the
wish of both author and audience for it to go on forever It was not
published at once for several reasons the main one being that A Tramp
Abroad had just been issued from the press and a second book might
interfere with its sale

As it was the Tramp proved a successful booknever as successful as
the Innocents for neither its humor nor its description had quite the
fresh quality of the earlier work In the beginning however the sales
were large the advance orders amounting to twentyfive thousand copies
and the return to the author forty thousand dollars for the first year




XLI

GENERAL GRANT AT HARTFORD

A third little girl came to the Clemens household during the summer of
1880 They were then at Quarry Farm and Clemens wrote to his friend
Twichell

 DEAR OLD JOEConcerning Jean Clemens if anybody said he didnt
 see no pints about that frog thats any better than any other
 frog I should think he was convicting himself of being a pretty
 poor sort of an observer   It is curious to note the change in
 the stockquotations of the Affection Board Four weeks ago the
 children put Mama at the head of the list right along where she has
 always been but now

 Jean
 Mama
 Motley cat
 Fraulein cat
 Papa

 That is the way it stands now Mama is become No 2 I have dropped
 from 4 and become No 5 Some time ago it used to be nip and tuck
 between me and the cats but after the cats developed I didnt
 stand any more show

Those were happy days at Quarry Farm The little new baby thrived on
that summer hilltop

Also it may be said the cats Mark Twains children had inherited
his love for cats and at the farm were always cats of all ages and
varieties Many of the bedtime stories were about these petsstories
invented by Mark Twain as he went alongstories that began anywhere and
ended nowhere and continued indefinitely from evening to evening
trailing off into dreamland

The great humorist cared less for dogs though he was never unkind to
them and once at the farm a gentle hound named Bones won his affection
When the end of the summer came and Clemens as was his habit started
down the drive ahead of the carriage Bones halfway to the entrance
was waiting for him Clemens stooped down put his arms about him and
bade him an affectionate goodby

Eighteen hundred and eighty was a Presidential year Mark Twain was for
General Garfield and made a number of remarkable speeches in his favor
General Grant came to Hartford during the campaign and Mark Twain was
chosen to make the address of welcome Perhaps no such address of
welcome was ever made before He began

 I am among those deputed to welcome you to the sincere and cordial
 hospitalities of Hartford the city of the historic and revered
 Charter Oak of which most of the town is built

He seemed to be at a loss what to say next and leaning over pretended
to whisper to Grant Then as if he had been prompted by the great
soldier he straightened up and poured out a fervid eulogy on Grants
victories adding in an aside as he finished I nearly forgot that
part of my speech to the roaring delight of his hearers while Grant
himself grimly smiled

He then spoke of the General being now out of public employment and how
grateful his country was to him and how it stood ready to reward him in
every conceivableinexpensiveway

Grant had smiled more than once during the speech and when this sentence
came out at the end his composure broke up altogether while the throng
shouted approval Clemens made another speech that night at the
operahousea speech long remembered in Hartford as one of the great
efforts of his life

A very warm friendship had grown up between Mark Twain and General Grant
A year earlier on the famous soldiers return from his trip around the
world a great birthday banquet had been given him in Chicago at which
Mark Twains speech had been the event of the evening The colonel who
long before had chased the young pilotsoldier through the Mississippi
bottoms had become his conquering hero and Grants admiration for
Americas foremost humorist was most hearty Now and again Clemens urged
General Grant to write his memoirs for publication but the hero of many
battles was afraid to venture into the field of letters He had no
confidence in his ability to write He did not realize that the man who
had written I will fight it out on this line if it takes all summer
and later Let us have peace was capable of English as terse and
forceful as the Latin of Caesars Commentaries

MANY INVESTMENTS

The Prince and the Pauper delayed for one reason and another did not
make its public appearance until the end of 1881 It was issued by
Osgood of Boston and was a different book in every way from any that
Mark Twain had published before Mrs Clemens who loved the story had
insisted that no expense should be spared in its making and it was
indeed a handsome volume It was filled with beautiful penandink
drawings and the binding was rich The dedication to its two earliest
critics read

 To those goodmannered and agreeable
 children Susy and Clara Clemens

The story itself was unlike anything in Mark Twains former work It was
pure romance a beautiful idyllic tale though not without his touch of
humor and humanity on every page And how breathlessly interesting it
is We may imagine that first little audiencethe two goodmannered
and agreeable children drawing up in their little chairs by the
fireside hanging on every paragraph of the adventures of the wandering
prince and Tom Canty the pauper king eager always for more

The story at first was not entirely understood by the reviewers They
did not believe it could be serious They expected a joke in it
somewhere Some even thought they had found it But it was not a joke
it was just a simple talea beautiful picture of a longvanished time
One critic wiser than the rest said

 The characters of those two boys twin in spirit will rank with the
 purest and loveliest creations of childlife in the realm of
 fiction

Mark Twain was now approaching the fullness of his fame and prosperity
The income from his writing was large Mrs Clemens possessed a
considerable fortune of her own they had no debts Their home was as
perfectly appointed as a home could well be their family life was ideal
They lived in the large hospitable way which Mrs Clemens had known in
her youth and which her husband with his Southern temperament loved
Their friends were of the worlds chosen and they were legion in number
There were always guests in the Clemens homeso many indeed were
constantly coming and going that Mark Twain said he was going to set up a
private bus to save carriage hire Yet he loved it all dearly and for
the most part realized his happiness

Unfortunately there were moments when he forgot that his lot was
satisfactory and tried to improve it His Colonel Sellers imagination
inherited from both sides of his family led him into financial
adventures which were generally unprofitable There were no silvermines
in the East into which to empty money and effort as in the old Nevada
days but there were plenty of other thingsinventions stock companies
and the like

When a man came along with a patent steamgenerator which would save
ninety per cent of the usual coalsupply Mark Twain invested whatever
bank surplus he had at the moment and saw that money no more forever

After the steamgenerator came a steampulley a small affair but
powerful enough to relieve him of thirtytwo thousand dollars in a brief
time

A new method of marine telegraphy was offered him by the time his balance
had grown again a promising contrivance but it failed to return the
twentyfive thousand dollars invested in it by Mark Twain The list of
such adventures is too long to set down here They differ somewhat but
there is one feature common to allnone of them paid At last came a
chance in which there was really a fortune A certain Alexander Graham
Bell an inventor one day appeared offering stock in an invention for
carrying the human voice on an electric wire But Mark Twain had grown
wise he thought Long after he wrote

 I declined I said I did not want any more to do with wildcat
 speculation  I said I didnt want it at any price He Bell
 became eager and insisted I take five hundred dollars worth He
 said he would sell me as much as I wanted for five hundred dollars
 offered to let me gather it up in my hands and measure it in a plug
 hat said I could have a whole hatful for five hundred dollars But
 I was a burnt child and resisted all these temptationsresisted
 them easily went off with my money and next day lent five thousand
 of it to a friend who was going to go bankrupt three days later

It was the chance of fortune thus thrown away which perhaps led him to
take up later with an engraving processan adventure which lasted
through several years and ate up a heavy sum Altogether these
experiences in finance cost Mark Twain a fairsized fortune though
after all they were as nothing compared with the great typemachine
calamity which we shall hear of in a later chapter

BACK TO THE RIVER WITH BIXBY

Fortunately Mark Twain was not greatly upset by his losses They
exasperated him for the moment perhaps but his violence waned
presently and the whole matter was put aside forever His work went on
with slight interference Looking over his Mississippi chapters one day
he was taken with a new interest in the river and decided to make the
steamboat trip between St Louis and New Orleans to report the changes
that had taken place in his twentyone years of absence His Boston
publisher Osgood agreed to accompany him and a stenographer was
engaged to take down conversations and comments

At St Louis they took passage on the steamer Gold DustClemens under
an assumed name though he was promptly identified In his book he tells
how the pilot recognized him and how they became friends Once in later
years he said

 I spent most of my time up there with him When we got down below
 Cairo where there was a big full riverfor it was highwater
 season and there was no danger of the boat hitting anything so long
 as she kept in the riverI had her most of the time on his watch
 He would lie down and sleep and leave me there to dream that the
 years had not slipped away that there had been no war no mining
 days no literary adventures that I was still a pilot happy and
 carefree as I had been twenty years before

To heighten the illusion he had himself called regularly with the
fouroclock watch in order not to miss the mornings The points along
the river were nearly all new to him everything had changed but during
highwater this mattered little He was a pilot againa young fellow in
his twenties speculating on the problems of existence and reading his
fortunes in the stars The river had lost none of its charm for him To
Bixby he wrote

 Id rather be a pilot than anything else Ive ever been in my life
 How do you run Plum Point

He met Bixby at New Orleans Bixby was a captain now on the splendid
new Anchor Line steamer City of Baton Rouge one of the last of the
fine river boats Clemens made the return trip to St Louis with Bixby
on the Baton Rougealmost exactly twentyfive years from their first
trip together To Bixby it seemed wonderfully like those old days back
in the fifties

Sam was making notes in his memorandumbook just as he always did
said Bixby long after to the writer of this history

Mark Twain decided to see the river above St Louis He went to Hannibal
to spend a few days with old friends Delightful days he wrote home
loitering around all day long and talking with grayheads who were boys
and girls with me thirty or forty years ago He took boat for St Paul
and saw the upper river which he had never seen before He thought the
scenery beautiful but he found a sadness everywhere because of the decay
of the river trade In a notebook entry he said The romance of
boating is gone now In Hannibal the steamboatman is no longer a god

He worked at the Mississippi book that summer at the farm but did not
get on very well and it was not until the following year 1883 that it
came from the press Osgood published it and Charles L Webster who
had married Mark Twains niece Annie daughter of his sister Pamela
looked after the agency sales Mark Twain in fact was preparing to
become his own publisher and this was the beginning Webster was a man
of ability and the book sold well

Life on the Mississippi is one of Mark Twains best booksone of those
which will live longest The first twenty chapters are not excelled in
quality anywhere in his writings The remainder of the book has an
interest of its own but it lacks the charm of those memories of his
youththe mellow light of other days which enhances all of his better
work




XLIV

A READINGTOUR WITH CABLE

Every little while Mark Twain had a fever of playwriting and it was
about this time that he collaborated with W D Howells on a second
Colonel Sellers play It was a lively combination

Once to the writer Howells said Clemens took one scene and I another
We had loads of fun about it We cracked our sides laughing over it
as we went along We thought it mighty good and I think to this day it
was mighty good

But actors and managers did not agree with them Raymond who had played
the original Sellers declared that in this play the Colonel had not
become merely a visionary but a lunatic The play was offered
elsewhere and finally Mark Twain produced it at his own expense But
perhaps the public agreed with Raymond for the venture did not pay

It was about a year after this the winter of 18845 that Mark Twain
went back to the lecture platformor rather he joined with George W
Cable in a readingtour Cable had been giving readings on his own
account from his wonderful Creole stories and had visited Mark Twain in
Hartford While there he had been taken down with the mumps and it was
during his convalescence that the plan for a combined readingtour had
been made This was early in the year and the tour was to begin in the
autumn

Cable meantime having quite recovered conceived a plan to repay Mark
Twains hospitality It was to be an Aprilfoola great complimentary
joke A few days before the first of the month he had a private and
confidential circular letter printed and mailed it to one hundred and
fifty of Mark Twains friends and admirers in Boston New York and
elsewhere asking that they send the humorist a letter to arrive April 1
requesting his autograph It would seem that each one receiving this
letter must have responded to it for on the morning of April 1st an
immense pile of letters was unloaded on Mark Twains table He did not
know what to make of it and Mrs Clemens who was party to the joke
slyly watched results They were the most absurd requests for autographs
ever written He was fooled and mystified at first then realizing the
nature and magnitude of the joke he entered into it fullydelighted of
course for it was really a fine compliment Some of the letters asked
for autographs by the yard some by the pound Some commanded him to sit
down and copy a few chapters from The Innocents Abroad Others asked
that his autograph be attached to a check John Hay requested that he
copy a hymn a few hundred lines of Youngs Night Thoughts etc and
added

 I want my boy to form a taste for serious and elevated poetry and
 it will add considerable commercial value to have it in your
 handwriting

Altogether the reading of the letters gave Mark Twain a delightful day

The platform tour of Clemens and Cable that fall was a success They had
good houses and the work of these two favorites read by the authors of
it made a fascinating program

They continued their tour westward as far as Chicago and gave readings in
Hannibal and Keokuk Orion Clemens and his wife once more lived in
Keokuk and with them Jane Clemens brisk and active for her eightyone
years She had visited Hartford more than once and enjoyed Sams fine
house but she chose the West for home Orion Clemens honest earnest
and industrious had somehow missed success in life The more prosperous
brother however made an allowance ample for all Mark Twains mother
attended the Keokuk reading Later at home when her children asked her
if she could still dance she had been a great dancer in her youth she
rose and in spite of her fourscore tripped as lightly as a girl It
was the last time that Mark Twain would see her in full health

At Christmastime Cable and Clemens took a fortnights holiday and
Clemens went home to Hartford There a grand surprise awaited him Mrs
Clemens had made an adaptation of The Prince and the Pauper for the
stage and his children with those of the neighborhood had learned the
parts A good stage had been set up in George Warners home with a
pretty dropcurtain and very good scenery indeed Clemens arrived in the
late afternoon and felt an air of mystery in the house but did not
guess what it meant By and by he was led across the grounds to George
Warners home into a large room and placed in a seat directly fronting
the stage Then presently the curtain went up the play began and he
knew As he watched the little performers playing so eagerly the parts
of his story he was deeply moved and gratified

It was only the beginning of The Prince and the Pauper production The
play was soon repeated Clemens himself taking the part of Miles Hendon
In a biography of her father which Susy began a little later she
wrote

 Papa had only three days to learn the part in but still we were all
 sure he could do it     I was the prince and Papa and I
 rehearsed two or three times a day for the three days before the
 appointed evening Papa acted his part beautifully and he added to
 the scene making it a good deal longer He was inexpressibly
 funny with his great slouch hat and gaitoh such a gait

Susys sister Clara took the part of Lady Jane Gray while little Jean
aged four in the part of a court official sat at a small table and
constantly signed state papers and deathwarrants




XLV

THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN

Meantime Mark Twain had really become a publisher His nephew by
marriage Charles L Webster who with Osgood had handled the
Mississippi book was now established under the firm name of Charles L
Webster  Co Samuel L Clemens being the company Clemens had another
book ready and the new firm were to handle it throughout

The new book was a story which Mark Twain had begun one day at Quarry
Farm nearly eight years before It was to be a continuation of the
adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn especially of the latter as told
by himself But the author had no great opinion of the tale and
presently laid it aside Then some seven years later after his trip
down the river he felt again the inspiration of the old days and the
story of Hucks adventures had been continued and brought to a close
The author believed in it by this time and the firm of Webster  Co
was really formed for the purpose of publishing it

Mark Twain took an active interest in the process From the pages of
Life he selected an artista young man named E W Kemble who would
later become one of our foremost illustrators of Southern character He
also gave attention to the selection of the paper and the bindingeven
to the method of canvassing for the sales In a note to Webster he
wrote

 Get at your canvassing early and drive it with all your might  
   If we havent 40000 subscriptions we simply postpone
 publication till weve got them

Mark Twain was making himself believe that he was a business man and in
this instance at least he seems to have made no mistake Some advanced
chapters of Huck appeared serially in the Century Magazine and the
public was eager for more By the time the Century chapters were
finished the forty thousand advance subscriptions for the book had been
taken and Huck Finns own story so long pushed aside and delayed came
grandly into its own Many grownup readers and most critics declared
that it was greater than the Tom Sawyer book though the younger
readers generally like the first book the best it being rather more in
the juvenile vein Hucks story in fact was soon causing quite
grownup discussionsdiscussions as to its psychology and moral phases
matters which do not interest small people who are always on Hucks side
in everything and quite willing that he should take any risk of body or
soul for the sake of Nigger Jim Poor vagrant Ben Blankenship hiding
his runaway negro in an Illinois swamp could not dream that his
humanity would one day supply the moral episode for an immortal book

As literature the story of Huck Finn holds a higher place than that of
Tom Sawyer As stories they stand side by side neither complete
without the other and both certain to live as long as there are real
boys and girls to read them

PUBLISHER TO GENERAL GRANT

Mark Twain was now a successful publisher but his success thus far was
nothing to what lay just ahead One evening he learned that General
Grant after heavy financial disaster had begun writing the memoirs
which he Clemens had urged him to undertake some years before Next
morning he called on the General to learn the particulars Grant had
contributed some articles to the Century war series and felt in a mood
to continue the work He had discussed with the Century publishers the
matter of a book Clemens suggested that such a book should be sold only
by subscription and prophesied its enormous success General Grant was
less sure His need of money was very great and he was anxious to get as
much return as possible but his faith was not large He was inclined to
make no special efforts in the matter of publication But Mark Twain
prevailed Like his own Colonel Sellers he talked glowingly and
eloquently of millions He first offered to direct the general to his
own former subscription publisher at Hartford then finally proposed to
publish it himself offering Grant seventy per cent of the net returns
and to pay all office expenses out of his own share

Of course there could be nothing for any publisher in such an arrangement
unless the sales were enormous General Grant realized this and at
first refused to consent Here was a friend offering to bankrupt himself
out of pure philanthropy a thing he could not permit But Mark Twain
came again and again and finally persuaded him that purely as business
proposition the offer was warranted by the certainty of great sales

So the firm of Charles L Webster  Co undertook the Grant book and the
old soldier broken in health and fortune was liberally provided with
means that would enable him to finish his task with his mind at peace
He devoted himself steadily to the workat first writing by hand then
dictating to a stenographer that Webster  Co provided His disease
cancer made fierce ravages but he fought it out on that line and
wrote the last pages of his memoirs by hand when he could no longer speak
aloud Mark Twain was much with him and cheered him with anecdotes and
news of the advance sale of his book In one of his memoranda of that
time Clemens wrote

 Today May 26 talked with General Grant about his and my first
 great Missouri campaign in 1861 He surprised an empty camp near
 Florida Missouri on Salt River which I had been occupying a day
 or two before How near he came to playing the d with his future
 publisher

At Mount McGregor a few weeks before the end General Grant asked if any
estimate could now be made of the sum which his family would obtain from
his work and was deeply comforted by Clemenss prompt reply that more
than one hundred thousand sets had already been sold the authors share
of which would exceed one hundred and fifty thousand dollars Clemens
added that the gross return would probably be twice as much more

The last notes came from Grants hands soon after that and a few days
later July 23 1885 his task completed he died To Henry Ward Beecher
Clemens wrote

 One day he put his pencil aside and said there was nothing more to
 do If I had been there I could have foretold the shock that struck
 the world three days later

In a memorandum estimate made by Mark Twain soon after the canvass for
the Grant memoirs had begun he had prophesied that three hundred
thousand sets of the book would be sold and that he would pay General
Grant in royalties 420000 This prophecy was more than fulfilled The
first check paid to Mrs Grantthe largest single royalty check in
historywas for 200000 Later payments brought her royalty return up
to nearly 450000 For once at least Mark Twains business vision had
been clear A fortune had been realized for the Grant family Even his
own share was considerable for out of that great sale more than a
hundred thousand dollars profit was realized by Webster  Co

THE HIGHTIDE OF FORTUNE

That summer at Quarry Farm was one of the happiest they had ever known
Mark Twain nearing fifty was in the fullness of his manhood and in the
brightest hour of his fortune Susy in her childish biography begun
at this time gives us a picture of him She begins

 We are a happy family We consist of Papa Mama Jean Clara and
 me It is Papa I am writing about and I shall have no trouble in
 not knowing what to say about him as he is a very striking
 character Papas appearance has been described many times but
 very incorrectly he has beautiful curly gray hair not any too
 thick or any too long just right a Roman nose which greatly
 improves the beauty of his features kind blue eyes and a small
 mustache he has a wonderfully shaped head and profile he has a
 very good figurein short is an extraordinarily finelooking man

 He is a very good man and a very funny one he has got a temper
 but we all have in this family He is the loveliest man I ever saw
 or ever hope to see and oh so absentminded

We may believe this is a true picture of Mark Twain at fifty He did not
look young for his years but he was still young in spirit and body
Susy tells how he blew bubbles for the children filling them with
tobacco smoke Also how he would play with the cats and come clear down
from his study to see how a certain kitten was getting along

Susy adds that there are eleven cats at the farm now and tells of the
days occupations but the description is too long to quote It reveals
a beautiful busy life

Susy herself was a gentle thoughtful romantic child One afternoon she
discovered a wonderful tangle of vines and bushes a still shutin
corner not far from the study She ran breathlessly to her aunt

Can I have itcan Clara and I have it all for our own

The petition was granted and the place was called Helens Bower for they
were reading Thaddeus of Warsaw and the name appealed to Susys poetic
fancy Something happened to the boweran unromantic workman mowed it
downbut by this time there was a little house there which Mrs Clemens
had built just for the children It was a complete little cottage when
furnished There was a porch in front with comfortable chairs Inside
were also chairs a table dishes shelves a broom even a stovesmall
but practical They called the little house Ellerslie out of Grace
Aguilars Days of Robert Bruce There alone or with their Langdon
cousins how many happy summers they played and dreamed away Secluded
by a hillside and happy trees overlooking the hazy distant town it was
a world aparta corner of storybook land When the end of the summer
came its little owners went about bidding their treasures goodby
closing and kissing the gates of Ellerslie

Looking back now Mark Twain at fifty would seem to have been in his
golden prime His family was idealhis surroundings idyllic Favored
by fortune beloved by millions honored now even in the highest places
what more had life to give When November 30th brought his birthday one
of the great Brahmins Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote him a beautiful
poem Andrew Lang Englands foremost critic also sent verses while
letters poured in from all sides

And Mark Twain realized his fortune and was disturbed by it To a friend
he said I am frightened at the proportions of my prosperity It seems
to me that whatever I touch turns to gold

BUSINESS DIFFICULTIES PLEASANTER THINGS

For the time it would seem that Mark Twain had given up authorship for
business The success of the Grant book had filled his head with plans
for others of a like nature The memoirs of General McClellan and
General Sheridan were arranged for Almost any warbook was considered a
good venture And there was another plan afoot Pope Leo XIII in his
old age had given sanction to the preparation of his memoirs and it was
to be published with his blessing by Webster  Co of Hartford It
was generally believed that such a book would have a tremendous sale and
Colonel Sellers himself could not have piled the figures higher than did
his creator in counting his prospective returns Every Catholic in the
world must have a copy of the Popes book and in America alone there
were millions Webster went to Rome to consult with the Pope in person
and was received in private audience Mark Twains publishing firm
seemed on the top wave of success

The McClellan and Sheridan books were issued and in due time the Life
of Pope Leo XIIIpublished simultaneously in six languagesissued from
the press A large advance sale had been guaranteed by the general
canvassing agentsa fortunate thing as it proved For strange as it
may seem the book did not prove a great success It is hard to explain
just why Perhaps Catholics felt that there had been so many popes that
the life of any particular one was no great matter The book paid but
not largely The McClellan and Sheridan books likewise were only
partially successful Perhaps the public was getting tired of war
memoirs Webster  Co undertook books of a general sorttravel
fiction poetry Many of them did not pay Their business from a march
of triumph had become a battle They undertook a Library of American
Literature a work of many volumes costly to make and even more so to
sell To float this venture they were obliged to borrow large sums

It seems unfortunate that Mark Twain should have been disturbed by these
distracting things during what should have been his literary hightide
As it was his business interests and cares absorbed the energy that
might otherwise have gone into books He was not entirely idle He did
an occasional magazine article or story and he began a book which he
worked at from time to time the story of a Connecticut Yankee who
suddenly finds himself back in the days of King Arthurs reign Webster
was eager to publish another book by his great literary partner but the
work on it went slowly Then Webster broke down from two years of
overwork and the business management fell into other hands Though
still recognized as a great publishinghouse those within the firm of
Charles L Webster  Co knew that its prospects were not bright

Furthermore Mark Twain had finally invested in another patent the
typesetting machine mentioned in a former chapter and the demands for
cash to promote this venture were heavy To his sister Pamela about the
end of 1887 he wrote The typesetter goes on forever at 3000 a
month Well be through with it in three or four months I reckon
a false hope for the three or four months would lengthen into as
many years

But if there were clouds gathering in the business sky they were not
often allowed to cast a shadow in Mark Twains home The beautiful house
in Hartford was a place of welcome and merriment of many guests and of
happy children Especially of happy children during these yearsthe
latter half of the eightieswhen Mark Twains fortunes were on the
decline his children were at the age to have a good time and certainly
they had it The dramatic stage which had been first set up at George
Warners for the Christmas Prince and Pauper performance was brought
over and set up in the Clemens schoolroom and every Saturday there were
plays or rehearsals and every little while there would be a grand
general performance in the great library downstairs which would
accommodate just eightyfour chairs filled by parents of the performers
and invited guests In notes dictated many years later Mark Twain said

 We dined as we could probably with a neighbor and by quarter to
 eight in the evening the hickory fire in the hall was pouring a
 sheet of flame up the chimney the house was in a drench of gas
 light from the ground floor up the guests were arriving and there
 was a babble of hearty greetings with not a voice in it that was
 not old and familiar and affectionate and when the curtain went up
 we looked out from the stage upon none but faces dear to us none
 but faces that were lit up with welcome for us

He was one of the children himself you see and therefore on the stage
with the others Katy Leary for thirty years in the family service
once said to the author The children were crazy about acting and we
all enjoyed it as much as they did especially Mr Clemens who was the
best actor of all I have never known a happier household than theirs
was during those years

The plays were not all given by the children Mark Twain had kept up his
German study and a class met regularly in his home to struggle with the
problems of der die and das By and by he wrote a play for the class
Meisterschaft a picturesque mixture of German and English which they
gave twice with great success It was unlike anything attempted before
or since No one but Mark Twain could have written it Later January
1888 in modified form it was published in the Century Magazine It
is his best work of this period

Many pleasant and amusing things could be recalled from these days if one
only had room A visit with Robert Louis Stevenson was one of them
Stevenson was stopping at a small hotel near Washington Square and he
and Clemens sat on a bench in the sunshine and talked through at least
one golden afternoon What marvelous talk that must have been Huck
Finn was one of Stevensons favorites and once he told how he had
insisted on reading the book aloud to an artist who was painting his
portrait The painter had protested at first but presently had fallen a
complete victim to Hucks story Once in a letter Stevenson wrote

 My father an old man has been prevailed upon to read Roughing It
 his usual amusement being found in theology and after one evening
 spent with the book he declared I am frightened It cannot be
 safe for a man at my time of life to laugh so much

Mark Twain had been a mugwump during the BlameCleveland campaign in
1880 which means that he had supported the independent Democratic
candidate Grover Cleveland He was therefore in high favor at the
White House during both Cleveland administrations and called there
informally whenever business took him to Washington But on one occasion
it was his first visit after the Presidents marriage there was to be a
party and Mrs Clemens who could not attend slipped a little note into
the pocket of his evening waistcoat where he would be sure to find it
when dressing warning him as to his deportment Being presented to
young Mrs Cleveland he handed her a card on which he had written He
didnt and asked her to sign her name below those words Mrs
Cleveland protested that she must know first what it was that he hadnt
done finally agreeing to sign if he would tell her immediately all about
it which he promised to do She signed and he handed her Mrs
Clemenss note It was very brief It said Dont wear your arctics in
the White House

Mrs Cleveland summoned a messenger and had the card mailed immediately
to Mrs Clemens

Absentmindedness was characteristic of Mark Twain He lived so much in
the world within that to him the material outer world was often vague and
shadowy Once when he was knocking the balls about in the billiardroom
George the colored butler a favorite and privileged household
character brought up a card So many canvassers came to sell him one
thing and another that Clemens promptly assumed this to be one of them
George insisted mildly but firmly that though a stranger the caller
was certainly a gentleman and Clemens grumblingly descended the stairs
As he entered the parlor the caller arose and extended his hand Clemens
took it rather limply for he had noticed some watercolors and
engravings leaning against the furniture as if for exhibition and he was
instantly convinced that the caller was a picturecanvasser Inquiries
by the stranger as to Mrs Clemens and the children did not change Mark
Twains conclusion He was polite but unresponsive and gradually
worked the visitor toward the front door His inquiry as to the home of
Charles Dudley Warner caused him to be shown eagerly in that direction

Clemens on his way back to the billiardroom heard Mrs Clemens call
himshe was ill that day Youth

Yes Livy He went in for a word

George brought me Mr Bs card I hope you were nice to him the Bs
were so nice to us once in Europe while you were gone

The Bs Why Livy

Yes of course and I asked him to be sure to call when he came to
Hartford

Well hes been here

Oh Youth have you done anything

Yes of course I have He seemed to have some pictures to sell so I
sent him over to Warners I noticed he didnt take them with him Land
sakes Livy what can I do

Go right after himgo quick Tell him what you have done

He went without further delay bareheaded and in his slippers as usual
Warner and B were in cheerful conversation They had met before
Clemens entered gaily

Oh yes I see You found him all right Charlie we met Mr B and
his wife in Europe and they made things pleasant for us I wanted to
come over here with him but I was a good deal occupied just then Livy
isnt very well but she seems now a good deal better so I just followed
along to have a good talk all together

He stayed an hour and whatever bad impression had formed in Bs mind
faded long before the hour ended Returning home Clemens noticed the
pictures still on the parlor floor

George he said what pictures are these that gentleman left

Why Mr Clemens those are our own pictures Mrs Clemens had me set
them around to see how they would look in new places The gentleman was
only looking at them while he waited for you to come down

It was in June 1888 that Yale College conferred upon Mark Twain the
degree of Master of Arts He was proud of the honor for it was
recognition of a kind that had not come to him beforeremarkable
recognition when we remember how as a child he had hated all schools and
study having ended his classroom days before he was twelve years old
He could not go to New Haven at the time but later in the year made the
students a delightful address In his capacity of Master of Arts he
said he had come down to New Haven to institute certain college reforms

By advice I turned my earliest attention to the Greek department I
told the Greek Professor I had concluded to drop the use of the
Greekwritten character because it is so hard to spell with and so
impossible to read after you get it spelt Let us draw the curtain there
I saw by what followed that nothing but early neglect saved him from
being a very profane man

He said he had given advice to the mathematical department with about the
same result The astronomy department he had found in a bad way He had
decided to transfer the professor to the law department and to put a
lawstudent in his place

A boy will be more biddable more tractablealso cheaper It is true he
cannot be entrusted with important work at first but he can comb the
skies for nebula till he gets his hand in

It was hardly the sort of an address that the holder of a college degree
is expected to make but doctors and students alike welcomed it
hilariously from Mark Twain

Not many great things happened to Mark Twain during this long period of
semiliterary inaction but many interesting ones When Bill Nye the
humorist and James Whitcomb Riley joined themselves in an entertainment
combination Mark Twain introduced them to their first Boston audiencea
great event to them and to Boston Clemens himself gave a reading now
and then but not for money Once when Col Richard Malcolm Johnston
and Thomas Nelson Page were to give a reading in Baltimore Pages wife
fell ill and Colonel Johnston wired to Charles Dudley Warner asking him
to come in Pages stead Warner unable to go handed the telegram to
Clemens who promptly answered that he would come They read to a packed
house and when the audience had gone and the returns were counted an
equal amount was handed to each of the authors Clemens pushed his share
over to Johnston saying

Thats yours Colonel Im not reading for money these days

Colonel Johnston to whom the sum was important tried to thank him but
Clemens only said

Never mind Colonel it only gives me pleasure to do you that little
favor You can pass it along some day


As a matter of fact Mark Twain himself was beginning to be hard pressed
for funds at this time but was strong in the faith that he would
presently be a multimillionaire The typesetting machine was still
costing a vast sum but each week its inventor promised that a few more
weeks or months would see it finished and then a tide of wealth would
come rolling in Mark Twain felt that a man with shiploads of money
almost in port could not properly entertain the public for pay He read
for institutions schools benefits and the like without charge

KIPLING AT ELMIRA ELSIE LESLIE THE YANKEE

One day during the summer of 1889 a notable meeting took place in Elmira
On a blazing forenoon a rather small and very hot young man in a slow
sizzling hack made his way up East Hill to Quarry Faun He inquired for
Mark Twain only to be told that he was at the Langdon home down in the
town which the young man had just left So he sat for a little time on
the pleasant veranda and Mrs Crane and Susy Clemens who were there
brought him some cool milk and listened to him talk in a way which seemed
to them very entertaining and wonderful When he went away he left his
card with a name on it strange to themstrange to the world at that
time The name was Rudyard Kipling Also on the card was the address
Allahabad and Sissy kept it because to her India was fairyland

Kipling went down into Elmira and found Mark Twain In his book
American Notes he has left an account of that visit He claimed that
he had traveled around the world to see Mark Twain and his article
begins

 You are a contemptible lot over yonder Some of you are
 commissioners and some are lieutenantgovernors and some have the
 V C and a few are privileged to walk about the Mall arm in arm
 with the viceroy but I have seen Mark Twain this golden morning
 have shaken his hand and smoked a cigarno two cigarswith him
 and talked with him for more than two hours

But one should read the article entireit is so worth while Clemens
also long after dictated an account of the meeting

Kipling came down and spent a couple of hours with me and at the end of
that time I had surprised him as much as he had surprised meand the
honors were easy I believed that he knew more than any person I had met
before and I knew that he knew that I knew less than any person he had
met before   When he had gone Mrs Langdon wanted to know about my
visitor I said

He is a stranger to me but he is a most remarkable manand I am the
other one Between us we cover all knowledge He knows all that can be
known and I know the rest

He was a stranger to me and all the world and remained so for twelve
months but then he became suddenly known and universally known  
George Warner came into our library one morning in Hartford with a
small book in his hand and asked me if I had ever heard of Rudyard
Kipling I said No

He said I would hear of him very soon and that the noise he made would
be loud and continuous   A day or two later he brought a copy of
the London World which had a sketch of Kipling in it and a mention of
the fact that he had traveled in the United States According to the
sketch he had passed through Elmira This remark with the additional
fact that he hailed from India attracted my attentionalso Susys She
went to her room and brought his card from its place in the frame of her
mirror and the Quarry Farm visitor stood identified

A theatrical production of The Prince and the Pauper dramatized by
Mrs A S Richardson was one of the events of this period It was a
charming performance even if not a great financial success and little
Elsie Leslie who played the double part of the Prince and Tom Canty
became a great favorite in the Clemens home She was also a favorite of
the actor and playwright William Gillette 9 and once when Clemens and
Gillette were together they decided to give the little girl a surprisea
pair of slippers in fact embroidered by themselves In his
presentation letter to her Mark Twain wrote

Either of us could have thought of a single slipper but it took both of
us to think of two slippers In fact one of us did think of one
slipper and then quick as a flash the other thought of the other one

He apologized for his delay

You see it was my first attempt at art and I couldnt rightly get the
hang of it along at first And then I was so busy I couldnt get a
chance to work at home and they wouldnt let me embroider on the cars
they said it made the other passengers afraid   Take the slippers
and wear them next your heart Elsie dear for every stitch in them is a
testimony of the affection which two of your loyalest friends bear you
Every single stitch cost us blood Ive got twice as many pores in me
now as I used to have     Do not wear these slippers in public
dear it would only excite envy and as like as not somebody would try
to shoot you

For five years Mark Twain had not published a book Since the appearance
of Huck Finn at the end of 1884 he had given the public only an
occasional magazine story or article His business struggle and the
typesetter had consumed not only his fortune but his time and energy
Now at last however a book was ready A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthurs Court came from the press of Webster  Co at the end of 1889
a handsome book elaborately and strikingly illustrated by Dan Bearda
pretentious volume which Mark Twain really considered his last Its my
swansong my retirement from literature permanently he wrote Howells
though certainly he was young fiftyfour to have reached this
conclusion

The story of the Yankeea fanciful narrative of a skilled Yankee
mechanic swept backward through the centuries to the dim day of Arthur
and his Round Tableis often grotesque enough in its humor but under it
all is Mark Twains great humanity in fierce and noble protest against
unjust laws the tyranny of an individual or of a ruling class
oppression of any sort As in The Prince and the Pauper the wandering
heir to the throne is brought in contact with cruel injustice and misery
so in the Yankee the king himself becomes one of a band of fettered
slaves and through degradation and horror of soul acquires mercy and
humility

The Yankee in King Arthurs Court is a splendidly imagined tale
Edmund Clarence Stedman and William Dean Howells have ranked it very
high Howells once wrote Of all the fanciful schemes in fiction it
pleases me most The Yankee has not held its place in public favor
with Mark Twains earlier books but it is a wonderful tale and we
cannot afford to leave it unread

When the summer came again Mark Twain and his family decided for once to
forego Quarry Farm for a season in the Catskills and presently found
themselves located in a cottage at Onteora in the midst of a most
delightful colony Mrs Mary Mapes Dodge then editor of St Nicholas
was there and Mrs Custer and Brander Matthews and Lawrence Hutton and a
score of other congenial spirits There was constant visiting from one
cottage to another with frequent gatherings at the Inn which was
general headquarters Susy Clemens now eighteen was a central figure
brilliant eager intense ambitious for achievementlacking only in
physical strength She was so flowerlike it seemed always that her
fragile body must be consumed by the flame of her spirit It was a happy
summer but it closed sadly Clemens was called to Keokuk in August to
his mothers bedside A few weeks later came the end and Jane Clemens
had closed her long and useful life She was in her eightyeighth year
A little later at Elmira followed the death of Mrs Clemenss mother a
sweet and gentle woman

9 Gillette was originally a Hartford boy Mark Twain had recognized
his ability advanced him funds with which to complete his dramatic
education and Gillettes first engagement seems to have been with the
Colonel Sellers company Mark Twain often advanced money in the interest
of education A young sculptor he sent to Paris for two years study
Among others he paid the way of two colored students through college




L

THE MACHINE GOODBY TO HARTFORD JOAN IS BEGUN

It was hoped that the profits from the Yankee would provide for all needs
until the great sums which were to come from the typesetter should come
rolling in The book did yield a large return but alas the hope of
the typesetter deferred year after year and month after month never
reached fulfilment Its inventor James W Paige whom Mark Twain once
called a poet a most great and genuine poet whose sublime creations
are written in steel during ten years of persistent experiment had
created one of the most marvelous machines ever constructed It would
set and distribute type adjust the spaces detect flawswould perform
in fact anything that a human being could do with more exactness and
far more swiftness Mark Twain himself a practical printer seeing it
in its earlier stages of development and realizing what a fortune must
come from a perfect typesetting machine was willing to furnish his last
dollar to complete the invention But there the trouble lay It could
never be complete It was too intricate too much like a human being
too easy to get out of order too hard to set right Paige fully
confident always believed he was just on the verge of perfecting some
appliance that would overcome all difficulties and the machine finally
consisted of twenty thousand minutely exact parts each of which required
expert workmanship and had to be fitted by hand Mark Twain once wrote

 All other wonderful inventions of the human brain sink pretty nearly
 into commonplaces contrasted with this awful mechanical miracle

This was true and it conveys the secret of its failure It was too much
of a miracle to be reliable Sometimes it would run steadily for hours
but then some part of its delicate mechanism would fail and days even
weeks were required to repair it It is all too long a story to be
given here It has been fully told elsewhere10 By the end of 1890
Mark Twain had put in all his available capital and was heavily in debt
He had spent one hundred and ninety thousand dollars on the machine no
penny of which would ever be returned Outside capital to carry on the
enterprise was promised but it failed him Still believing that there
were millions in it he realized that for the present at least he
could do no more

Two things were clear he must fall back on authorship for revenue and
he must retrench In the present low stage of his fortunes he could no
longer afford to live in the Hartford house He decided to take the
family abroad where living was cheaper and where he might be able to
work with fewer distractions

He began writing at a great rate articles and stories for the magazines
He hunted out the old play he had written with Howells long before and
made a book of it The American Claimant Then in June 1891 they
closed the beautiful Hartford house where for seventeen years they had
found an ideal home where the children had grown through their sweet
early life where the worlds wisest had come and gone pausing a little
to laugh with the worlds greatest merrymaker The furniture was
shrouded the curtains drawn the light shut away

While the carriage was waiting Mrs Clemens went back and took a last
look into each of the rooms as if bidding a kind of goodby to the past
Then she entered the carriage and Patrick McAleer who had been with
Mark Twain and his wife since their weddingday drove them to the
station for the last time

Mark Twain had a contract for six newspaper letters at one thousand
dollars each He was troubled with rheumatism in his arm and wrote his
first letter from AixlesBains a wateringplacea healthfactory as
he called itand another from Marienbad They were in Germany in
August and one day came to Heidelberg where they occupied their old
apartment of thirteen years before room forty in the Schloss Hotel
with its far prospect of wood and hill the winding Neckar and the blue
distant valley of the Rhine Then presently they came to Switzerland
to OuchyLausanne by lovely Lake Geneva and here Clemens left the
family and with a guide and a boatman went drifting down the Rhone in a
curious flatbottomed craft thinking to find material for one or more
articles possibly for a book But drifting down that fair river through
still September days past ancient drowsy villages among sloping
vineyards where grapes were ripening in the tranquil sunlight was too
restful and soothing for work In a letter home he wrote

 Its too delicious floating with the swift current under the awning
 these superb sunshiny days in peace and quietness Some of the
 curious old historical towns strangely persuade me but its so
 lovely afloat that I dont stop but view them from the outside and
 sail on   I want to do all the rivers of Europe in an open boat
 in summer weather

One afternoon about fifteen miles below the city of Valence he made a
discovery Dreamily observing the eastward horizon he noticed that a
distant blue mountain presented a striking profile outline of Napoleon
Bonaparte It seemed really a great natural wonder and he stopped that
night at the village just below Beauchastel a hoary huddle of houses
with the roofs all run together and took a room at the little hotel
with a window looking to the eastward from which next morning he saw
the profile of the great stone face wonderfully outlined against the
sunrise He was excited over his discovery and made a descriptive note
of it and an outline sketch Then drifting farther down the river he
characteristically forgot all about it and did not remember it again for
ten years by which time he had forgotten the point on the river where
the Napoleon could be seen forgotten even that he had made a note and
sketch giving full details He wished the Napoleon to be found again
believing as he declared that it would become one of the natural
wonders of the world To travelers going to France he attempted to
describe it and some of these tried to find it but as he located it
too far down the Rhone no one reported success and in time he spoke of
his discovery as the Lost Napoleon It was not until after Mark
Twains death that it was rediscovered and then by the writer of this
memoir who having Mark Twains notebook11 with its exact memoranda
on another September day motoring up the Rhone located the blue profile
of the reclining Napoleon opposite the gray village of Beauchastel It
is a really remarkable effigy and deserves to be visited

Clemens finished his trip at Arlesa beautiful trip from beginning to
end but without literary result When he undertook to write of it he
found that it lacked incident and what was worse it lacked humor To
undertake to create both was too much After a few chapters he put the
manuscript aside unfinished and so it remains to this day

The Clemens family spent the winter in Berlin a gay winter with Mark
Twain as one of the distinguished figures of the German capital He was
received everywhere and made much of Once a small choice dinner was
given him by Kaiser William II and later a breakfast by the Empress
His books were great favorites in the German royal family The Kaiser
particularly enjoyed the Mississippi book while the essay on The
Awful German Language in the Tramp Abroad he pronounced one of the
finest pieces of humor ever written Mark Twains books were favorites
in fact throughout Germany The doorman in his hotel had them all in
his little room and discovering one day that their guest Samuel L
Clemens and Mark Twain were one he nearly exploded with excitement
Dragging the author to his small room he pointed to the shelf

There he said you wrote them Ive found it out Ach I did not
know it before and I ask a million pardons

Affairs were not going well in America and in June Clemens made a trip
over to see what could be done Probably he did very little and he was
back presently at Nauheim a wateringplace where he was able to work
rather quietly He began two storiesone of them The Extraordinary
Twins which was the first form of Puddnhead Wilson the other Tom
Sawyer Abroad for St Nicholas Twichell came to Nauheim during the
summer and one day he and Clemens ran over to Homburg not far away
The Prince of Wales later King Edward VII was there and Clemens and
Twichell walking in the park met the Prince with the British
ambassador and were presented Twichell in an account of the meeting
said

 The meeting between the Prince and Mark was a most cordial one on
 both sides and presently the Prince took Mark Twains arm and the
 two marched up and down talking earnestly together the Prince
 solid erect and soldierlike Clemens weaving along in his
 curious swinging gait in full tide of talk and brandishing a sun
 umbrella of the most scandalous description

At Villa Viviani an old old mansion outside of Florence on the hill
toward Settignano Mark Twain finished Tom Sawyer Abroad also
Puddnhead Wilson and wrote the first half of a book that really had
its beginning on the day when an apprenticeboy in Hannibal he had
found a stray leaf from the pathetic story of Joan of Arc All his
life she had been his idol and he had meant some day to write of her
Now in this weatherstained old palace looking down on Florence
medieval and hazy and across to the villadotted hills he began one of
the most beautiful stories ever written The Personal Recollections of
Joan of Arc He wrote in the first person assuming the character of
Joans secretary Sieur Louis de Conte who in his old age is telling the
great tale of the Maid of Orleans It was Mark Twains purpose this
time to publish anonymously Walking the floor one day at Viviani and
smoking vigorously he said to Mrs Clemens and Susy

 I shall never be accepted seriously over my own signature People
 always want to laugh over what I write and are disappointed if they
 dont find a joke in it This is to be a serious book It means
 more to me than anything else I have ever undertaken I shall write
 it anonymously

So it was that the gentle Sieur de Conte took up the pen and the tale of
Joan was begun in the ancient garden of Viviani a setting appropriate to
its lovely form

He wrote rapidly when once his plan was perfected and his material
arranged The reading of his youth and manhood was now recalled not
merely as reading but as remembered reality It was as if he were truly
the old Sieur de Conte saturated with memories pouring out the tender
tragic tale In six weeks he had written one hundred thousand words
remarkable progress at any time the more so when we consider that some
of the authorities he consulted were in a foreign tongue He had always
more or less kept up his study of French begun so long ago on the river
and it stood him now in good stead Still it was never easy for him
and the multitude of notes that still exist along the margin of his
French authorities show the magnitude of his work Others of the family
went down into the city almost daily but he stayed in the still garden
with Joan Florence and its suburbs were full of delightful people some
of them old friends There were luncheons dinners teas dances and
the like always in progress but he resisted most of these things
preferring to remain the quaint old Sieur de Conte following again the
banner of the Maid of Orleans marshaling her twilight armies across his
illumined page

But the next spring March 1893 he was obliged to put aside the
manuscript and hurry to America again fruitlessly of course for a
financial stress was on the land the business of Webster  Co was on
the downgradenothing could save it There was new hope in the old
typesetting machine but his faith in the resurrection was not strong
The strain of his affairs was telling on him The business owed a great
sum with no prospect of relief Back in Europe again Mark Twain wrote
F D Hall his business manager in New York

 I am terribly tired of business I am by nature and disposition
 unfit for it and I want to get out of it I am standing on a
 volcano Get me out of business

Tantalizing letters continued to come holding out hope in the business
the machinein any straw that promised a little support through the
financial storm Again he wrote Hall

 Great Scott but its a long year for you and me I never knew the
 almanac to drag so   I watch for your letters hungrilyjust
 as I used to watch for the telegram saying the machine was finished
 but when next week certainly suddenly swelled into three weeks
 sure I recognized the old familiar tune I used to hear so much
 W dont know what sickheartedness is but he is in a fair way to
 find out

They closed Viviani in June and returned to Germany By the end of
August Clemens could stand no longer the strain of his American affairs
and leaving the family at some German baths he once more sailed for New
York

11 At Mark Twains death his various literary effects passed into the
hands of his biographer and literary executor the present writer




LI

THE FAILURE OF WEBSTER  CO AROUND THE WORLD SORROW

In a room at the Players Cluba cheap room he wrote home at 150
per dayMark Twain spent the winter hoping against hope to weather the
financial storm His fortunes were at a lower ebb than ever before
lower even than during those bleak mining days among the Esmeralda hills
Then there had been no one but himself and he was young Now at
fiftyeight he had precious lives dependent upon him and he was weighed
down by debt The liabilities of his firm were fully two hundred thousand
dollarssixty thousand of which were owing to Mrs Clemens for money
advancedbut the large remaining sum was due to banks printers
binders and the manufacturers of paper A panic was on the land and
there was no business What he was to do Clemens did not know He spent
most of his days in his room trying to write and succeeded in finishing
several magazine articles Outwardly cheerful he hid the bitterness of
his situation

A few however knew the true state of his affairs One of these one
night introduced him to Henry H Rogers the Standard Oil millionaire

Mr Clemens said Mr Rogers I was one of your early admirers I
heard you lecture a long time ago on the Sandwich Islands

They sat down at a table and Mark Twain told amusing stories Rogers
was in a perpetual gale of laughter They became friends from that
evening and in due time the author had confessed to the financier all
his business worries

You had better let me look into things a little Rogers said and he
advised Clemens to stop walking the floor

It was characteristic of Mark Twain to be willing to unload his affairs
upon any one that he thought able to bear the burden He became a new
man overnight With Henry Rogers in charge life was once more worth
while He accepted invitations from the Rogers family and from many
others and was presently so gay so widely sought and seen in so many
places that one of his acquaintances Jamie Dodge dubbed him the
Belle of New York

Henry Rogers meanwhile was looking into things He had reasonable
faith in the typemachine and advanced a large sum on the chance of its
proving a success This of course lifted Mark Twain quite into the
clouds Daily he wrote and cabled all sorts of glowing hopes to his
family then in Paris Once he wrote

 The ship is in sight now  When the anchor is down then I shall
 say Farewella long farewellto business I will never touch it
 again I will live in literature I will wallow in it revel in it
 I will swim in ink

Once he cabled Expect good news in ten days and a little later Look
out for good news and in a few days Nearing success

Those Sellerslike messages could not but appeal Mrs Clemenss sense of
humor even in those dark days To her sister she wrote They make me
laugh for they are so like my beloved Colonel

The affairs of Webster  Co Mr Rogers found a bad way When at last
in April 1894 the crisis camea demand by the chief creditors for
paymenthe advised immediate assignment as the only course

So the firm of Webster  Co closed its doors The business which less
than ten years before had begun so prosperously had ended in failure
Mark Twain nearing fiftynine was bankrupt When all the firms
effects had been sold and applied on the counts he was still more than
seventy thousand dollars in debt Friends stepped in and offered to lend
him money but he declined these offers Through Mr Rogers a basis of
settlement at fifty cents on the dollar was arranged and Mark Twain
said Give me time and I will pay the other fifty

No one but his wife and Mr Rogers however believed that at his age he
would be able to make good the promise Many advised him not to attempt
it but to settle once and for all on the legal basis as arranged
Sometimes in moments of despondency he almost surrendered Once he
said

I need not dream of paying it I never could manage it

But these were only the hard moments For the most part he kept up good
heart and confidence It is true that he now believed again in the
future of the typesetter and that returns from it would pay him out of
bankruptcy But later in the year this final hope was taken away Mr
Rogers wrote to him that in the final test the machine had failed to
prove itself practical and that the whole project had been finally and
permanently abandoned The shock of disappointment was heavy for the
moment but then it was overcompletely overfor that old mechanical
demon that vampire of invention that had sapped his fortune so long was
laid at last The worst had happened there was nothing more to dread
Within a week Mark Twain he was now back in Paris with the family had
settled down to work once more on the Recollections of Joan and all
mention and memory of the typesetter was forever put away The machine
stands today in the Sibley College of Engineering where it is exhibited
as the costliest piece of mechanism for its size ever constructed Mark
Twain once received a letter from an author who had written a book to
assist inventors and patentees asking for his indorsement He replied

 DEAR SIRI have as you say been interested in patents and
 patentees If your book tells how to exterminate inventors send me
 nine editions Send them by express

 Very truly yours

 S L CLEMENS

Those were economical days There was no income except from the old
books and at the time this was not large The Clemens family however
was cheerful and Mark Twain was once more in splendid working form The
story of Joan hurried to its tragic conclusion Each night he read to
the family what he had written that day and Susy who was easily moved
would say Waitwait till I get my handkerchief and one night when
the last pages had been written and read and the fearful scene at Rouen
had been depicted Susy wrote in her diary Tonight Joan of Arc was
burned at the stake Meaning that the book was finished

Susy herself had fine literary taste and might have written had not her
greater purpose been to sing There are fragments of her writing that
show the true literary touch Both Susy and her father cared more for
Joan than for any of the former books To Mr Rogers Clemens wrote
Possibly the book may not sell but that is nothingit was mitten for
love It was placed serially with Harpers Magazine and appeared
anonymously but the public soon identified the inimitable touch of Mark
Twain

It was now the spring of 1895 and Mark Twain had decided upon a new plan
to restore his fortunes Platform work had always paid him well and
though he disliked it now more than ever he had resolved upon something
unheard of in that linenothing less in fact than a platform tour
around the world In May with the family he sailed for America and
after a month or two of rest at Quarry Farm he set out with Mrs Clemens
and Clara and with his American agent J B Pond for the Pacific coast
Susy and Jean remained behind with their aunt at the farm The travelers
left Elmira at night and they always remembered the picture of Susy
standing under the electric light of the railway platform waving them
goodby

Mark Twains tour of the world was a success from the beginning
Everywhere he was received with splendid honorsin America in
Australia in New Zealand in India in Ceylon in South Africawherever
he went his welcome was a grand ovation his theaters and halls were
never large enough to hold his audiences With the possible exception of
General Grants long tour in 18789 there had hardly been a more gorgeous
progress than Mark Twains trip around the world Everywhere they were
overwhelmed with attention and gifts We cannot begin to tell the story
of that journey here In Following the Equator the author himself
tells it in his own delightful fashion

From time to time along the way Mark Twain forwarded his accumulated
profits to Mr Rogers to apply against his debts and by the time they
sailed from South Africa the sum was large enough to encourage him to
believe that with the royalties to be derived from the book he would
write of his travels he might be able to pay in full and so face the
world once more a free man Their long tripit had lasted a full year
was nearing its end They would spend the winter in LondonSusy and
Jean were notified to join them there They would all be reunited again
The outlook seemed bright once more

They reached England the last of July Susy and Jean with Katy Leary
were to arrive on the 12th of August But the 12th did not bring them
it brought instead a letter Susy was not well the letter said the
sailing had been postponed The letter added that it was nothing
serious but her parents cabled at once for later news Receiving no
satisfactory answer Mrs Clemens full of forebodings prepared to sail
with Clara for America Clemens would remain in London to arrange for
the winter residence A cable came saying Susys recovery would be slow
but certain Mrs Clemens and Clara sailed immediately In some notes
he once dictated Mark Twain said

 That was the 15th of August 1896 Three days later when my wife
 and Clara were about halfway across the ocean I was standing in
 our diningroom thinking of nothing in particular when a cablegram
 was put into my hand It said Susy was peacefully released
 today

Mark Twains life had contained other tragedies but no other that
equaled this one The dead girl had been his hearts pride it was a
year since they parted and now he knew he would never see her again
The blow had found him alone and among strangers In that day he could
not even reach out to those upon the ocean drawing daily nearer to the
heartbreak

Susy Clemens had died in the old Hartford home She had been well far a
time at the farm but then her health had declined She worked
continuously at her singing lessons and overtried her strength Then
she went on a visit to Mrs Charles Dudley Warner in Hartford but she
did not rest working harder than ever at her singing Finally she was
told that she must consult a physician The doctor came and prescribed
soothing remedies and advised that she have the rest and quiet of her
own home Mrs Crane came from Elmira also her uncle Charles Langdon
But Susy became worse and a few days later her malady was pronounced
meningitis This was the 15th of August the day that her mother and
Clara sailed from England She was delirious and burning with fever but
at last sank into unconsciousness She died three days later and on the
night that Mrs Clemens and Clara arrived was taken to Elmira for burial

They laid her beside the little brother that had died so long before and
ordered a headstone with some lines which they had found in Australia
written by Robert Richardson

 Warm summer sun shine kindly here
 Warm southern wind blow softly here
 Green sod above lie light lie light
 Good night dear heart good night good night




LII

EUROPEAN ECONOMIES

With Clara and Jean Mrs Clemens returned to England and in a modest
house on Tedworth Square a secluded corner of London the stricken
family hid themselves away for the winter Few even of their closest
friends knew of their whereabouts In time the report was circulated
that Mask Twain old sick and deserted by his family was living in
poverty toiling to pay his debts Through the London publishers a
distant cousin Dr James Clemens of St Louis located the house on
Tedworth Square and wrote offering assistance He was invited to call
and found a quiet placethe life there simplebut not poverty By and
by there was another reportthis time that Mark Twain was dead A
reporter found his way to Tedworth Square and being received by Mark
Twain himself asked what he should say

Clemens regarded him gravely then in his slow nasal drawl Saythat
the report of my deathhas been grosslyexaggerated a remark that a
day later was amusing both hemispheres He could not help his humor it
was his natural form of utterancethe medium for conveying fact
fiction satire philosophy Whatever his depth of despair the quaint
surprise of speech would come and it would be so until his last day

By November he was at work on his book of travel which he first thought
of calling Around the World He went out not at all that winter and
the work progressed steadily and was complete by the following May
1897

Meantime during his trip around the world Mark Twains publishers had
issued two volumes of his workthe Joan of Arc book and another Tom
Sawyer book the latter volume combining two rather short stories Tom
Sawyer Abroad published serially in St Nicholas and Tom Sawyer
Detective The Joan of Arc book the tenderest and most exquisite of
all Mark Twains worka tale told with the deepest sympathy and the
rarest delicacywas dedicated by the author to his wife as being the
only piece of his writing which he considered worthy of this honor He
regarded it as his best book and this was an opinion that did not
change Twelve years laterit was on his seventythird birthdayhe
wrote as his final verdict November 30 1908

 I like the Joan of Arc best of all my books and it is the best I
 know it perfectly well and besides it furnished me seven times
 the pleasure afforded me by any of the others twelve years of
 preparation and two years of writing The others needed no
 preparation and got none
 MARK TWAIN

The public at first did not agree with the authors estimate and the
demand for the book was not large But the public amended its opinion
The demand for Joan increased with each year until its sales ranked
with the most popular of Mark Twains books

The new stories of Tom and Huck have never been as popular as the earlier
adventures of this pair of heroes The shorter stories are less
important and perhaps less alive but they are certainly very readable
tales and nobody but Mark Twain could have written them

Clemens began some new stories when his travel book was out of the way
but presently with the family was on the way to Switzerland for the
summer They lived at Weggis on Lake Lucerne in the Villa Buhlegga
very modest fivefrancaday pension for they were economizing and
putting away money for the debts Mark Twain was not in a mood for work
and besides proofs of the new book Following the Equator as it is
now calledwere coming steadily But on the anniversary of Susys death
August 18th he wrote a poem In Memoriam in which he touched a
literary height never before attained It was published in Harpers
Magazine and now appears in his collected works

Across from Villa Buhlegg on the lakefront there was a small shaded
inclosure where he loved to sit and look out on the blue water and lofty
mountains one of which Rigi he and Twichell had climbed nineteen years
before The little retreat is still there and today one of the trees
bears a tablet in German Mark Twains Rest

Autumn found the family in Vienna located for the winter at the Hotel
Metropole Mrs Clemens realized that her daughters must no longer be
deprived of social and artistic advantages For herself she longed only
for retirement

Vienna is always a gay city a center of art and culture and splendid
social functions From the moment of his arrival Mark Twain and his
family were in the midst of affairs Their room at the Metropole became
an assemblingplace for distinguished members of the several circles that
go to make up the dazzling Viennese life Mrs Clemens to her sister in
America once wrote

 Such funny combinations are here sometimes one duke several
 counts several writers several barons two princes newspaper
 women etc

Mark Twain found himself the literary lion of the Austrian capital
Every club entertained him and roared with delight at his German
speeches Wherever he appeared on the streets he was recognized

Let him pass Dont you see it is Herr Mark Twain commanded an
officer to a guard who in the midst of a great assemblage had presumed
to bar the way




LIII

MARK TWAIN PAYS HIS DEBTS

Mark Twain wrote much and well during this period in spite of his social
life His article Concerning the Jews was written that first winter in
Viennaa fine piece of special pleading also the greatest of his short
storiesone of the greatest of all short storiesThe Man that
Corrupted Hadleyburg

But there were good reasons why he should write better now his mind was
free of a mighty loadhe had paid his debts

Soon after his arrival in Vienna he had written to Mr Rogers

 Let us begin on those debts I cannot bear the weight any longer
 It totally unfits me for work

He had accumulated a large sum for the purpose and the royalties from
the new book were beginning to roll in Payment of the debts was begun
At the end of December he wrote again

 Land we are glad to see those debts diminishing For the first
 time in my life I am getting more pleasure from paying money out
 than from pulling it in

A few days later he wrote to Howells that he had turned the corner and
again

 Weve lived close to the bone and saved every cent we could and
 theres no undisputed claim now that we cant cash     I
 hope you will never get the like of the load saddled on to you that
 was saddled on to me three years ago And yet there is such a
 solid pleasure in paying the things that I reckon it is worth while
 to get into that kind of a hobble after all Mrs Clemens gets
 millions of delight out of it and the children have never uttered
 one complaint about the scrimping from the beginning

By the end of January 1898 Clemens had accumulated enough money to make
the final payments to his creditors At the time of his failure he had
given himself five years to achieve this result But he had needed less
than four A report from Mr Rogers showed that a balance of thirteen
thousand dollars would remain to his credit after the last accounts were
wiped away

Clemens had tried to keep his money affairs out of the newspapers but
the payment of the final claims could not be concealed and the press
made the most of it Headlines shouted it Editorials heralded Mark
Twain as a second Walter Scott because Scott too had labored to lift a
great burden of debt Never had Mark Twain been so beloved by his
fellowmen

One might suppose now that he had had enough of invention and commercial
enterprises of every sortthat is one who did not know Mark Twain might
suppose thisbut it would not be true Within a month after his debts
were paid he was negotiating with the Austrian inventor Szczepanik for
the American rights in a wonderful carpetpattern machine and
Sellerslike was planning to organize a company with a capital of fifteen
hundred million dollars to control the carpetweaving industries of the
world He wrote to Mr Rogers about the great scheme inviting the
Standard Oil to come in but the plan failed to bear the test of Mr
Rogerss investigation and was heard of no more

Samuel Clemenss obligation to Henry Rogers was very great but it was
not quite the obligation that many supposed it to be It was often
asserted that the financier lent even gave the humorist large sums and
pointed out opportunities for speculation No part of this statement is
true Mr Rogers neither lent nor gave Mark Twain money and never
allowed him to speculate when he could prevent it He sometimes invested
Mark Twains own funds for him but he never bought for him a share of
stock without money in hand to pay for it in fullmoney belonging to
and earned by Clemens himself

What Henry Rogers did give to Mark Twain was his priceless counsel and
timegifts more precious than any mere sum of moneyfavors that Mark
Twain could accept without humiliation He did accept them and never
ceased to be grateful He rarely wrote without expressing his gratitude
and we get the size of Mark Twains obligation when in one letter we
read

 I have abundant peace of mind againno sense of burden Work is
 become a pleasureit is not labor any longer

He wrote much and well mainly magazine articles including some of those
chapters later gathered it his book on Christian Science He reveled
like a boy in his new freedom and fortunes in the lavish honors paid
him in the rich circumstance of Viennese life But always just beneath
the surface were unforgetable sorrows His face in repose was always
sad Once after writing to Howells of his successes he added

 All those things might move and interest one But how desperately
 more I have been moved tonight by the thought of a little old copy
 in the nursery of At the Back of the North Wind Oh what happy
 days they were when that book was read and how Susy loved it

RETURN AFTER EXILE

News came to Vienna of the death of Orion Clemens at the age of
seventytwo Orion had died as he had liveda gentle dreamer always
with a new plan He had not been sick at all One morning early he had
seated himself at a table with pencil and paper and was putting down
the details of his latest project when death camekindly in the moment
of new hope He was a generous upright man beloved by all who
understood him

The Clemenses remained two winters in Vienna spending the second at the
Hotel Krantz where their rooms were larger and finer than at the
Metropole and even more crowded with notabilities Their salon acquired
the name of the Second Embassy and Mark Twain was in fact the most
representative American in the Austrian capital It became the fashion
to consult him on every question of public interest his comments
whether serious or otherwise being always worth printing When European
disarmament was proposed Editor William T Stead of the Review of
Reviews wrote for his opinion He replied

 DEAR MR STEADThe Tsar is ready to disarm I am
 ready to disarm Collect the others it should not be
 much of a task now MARK TWAIN

He refused offers of many sorts He declined ten thousand dollars for a
tobacco endorsement though he liked the tobacco well enough He
declined ten thousand dollars a year for five years to lend his name as
editor of a humorous periodical He declined another ten thousand for
ten lectures and another offer for fifty lectures at the same rates
that is one thousand dollars per night He could get along without
these sums he said and still preserve some remnants of his
selfrespect

It was May 1899 when Clemens and his family left Vienna They spent a
summer in Sweden on account of the health of Jean Clemens and located
in London apartments30 Wellington Courtfor the winter Then followed
a summer at beautiful Dollis Hill an old house where Gladstone had often
visited on a shady hilltop just outside of London The city had not
quite enclosed the place then and there were spreading oaks a pond with
lilypads and wide spaces of grassy lawn The place today is converted
into a public garden called Gladstone Park Writing to Twichell in
midsummer Clemens said

 I am the only person who is ever in the house in the daytime but I
 am working and deep in the luxury of it But there is one
 tremendous defect Levy is all so enchanted with the place and so
 in love with it that she doesnt know how she is going to tear
 herself away from it

However there was one still greater attraction than Dollis Hill and
that was Americahome Mark Twain at sixtyfive and a free man once
more had decided to return to his native land They closed Dollis Hill
at the end of September and October 6 1900 sailed on the Minnehaha for
New York bidding goodby as Mark Twain believed and hoped to foreign
travel Nine days later to a reporter who greeted him on the ship he
said

 If I ever get ashore I am going to break both of my legs so I cant
 get away again

A PROPHET AT HOME

New York tried to outdo Vienna and London in honoring Mark Twain Every
newspaper was filled with the story of his great fight against debt and
his triumph He had behaved like Walter Scott writes Howells as
millions rejoiced to know who had not known how Walter Scott behaved till
they knew it was like Clemens Clubs and societies vied with one
another in offering him grand entertainments Literary and lecture
proposals poured in He was offered at the rate of a dollar a word for
his writinghe could name his own terms for lectures

These sensational offers did not tempt him He was sick of the platform
He made a dinner speech here and therealways an eventbut he gave no
lectures or readings for profit His literary work he confined to a few
magazines and presently concluded an arrangement with Harper 
Brothers for whatever he might write the payment to be twenty later
thirty cents per word He arranged with the same firm for the
publication of all his books by this time collected in uniform edition
He wished his affairs to be settled as nearly as might be His desire
was freedom from care Also he would have liked a period of quiet and
rest but that was impossible He realized that the multitude of honors
tendered him was in a sense a vast compliment which he could not entirely
refuse Howells writes that Mark Twains countrymen kept it up past all
precedent and in return Mark Twain tried to do his part His friends
saw that he was wearing himself out adds Howells and certain it is
that he grew thin and pale and had a hacking cough Once to Richard
Watson Gilder he wrote

 In bed with a chest cold and other company

 DEAR GILDERI cant If I were a well man I could explain
 with this pencil but in the circes I will leave it all to
 your imagination

 Was it Grady that killed himself trying to do all the dining
 and speeching No old man no no

 Ever yours MARK

In the various dinner speeches and other utterances made by Mark Twain at
this time his hearers recognized a new and great seriousness of purpose
It was not really new only perhaps more emphasized He still made
them laugh but he insisted on making them think too He preached a new
gospel of patriotismnot the patriotism that means a boisterous cheering
of the Stars and Stripes wherever unfurled but the patriotism that
proposes to keep the Stars and Stripes clean and worth shouting for In
one place he said

 We teach the boys to atrophy their independence We teach them to
 take their patriotism at second hand to shout with the largest
 crowd without examining into the right or wrong of the matter
 exactly as boys under monarchies are taught and have always been
 taught

He protested against the blind allegiance of monarchies He was seldom
with the largest crowd himself Writing much of our foreign affairs
then in a good deal of a muddle he assailed so fearlessly and fiercely
measures which he held to be unjust that he was caricatured as an armed
knight on a charger and as Huck Finn with a gun

But he was not always warlike One of the speeches he made that winter
was with Col Henry Watterson a former Confederate soldier at a Lincoln
birthday memorial at Carnegie Hall Think of it he wrote Twichell
two old rebels functioning there I as president and Watterson as orator
of the day Things have changed somewhat in these forty years thank
God

The Clemens household did not go back to Hartford During their early
years abroad it had been Mrs Clemenss dream to return and open the
beautiful home with everything the same as before The death of Susy
had changed all this The mother had grown more and more to feel that
she could not bear the sorrow of Susys absence in the familiar rooms
After a trip which Clemens himself made to Hartford he wrote I realize
that if we ever enter the house again to live our hearts will break

So they did not go back Mrs Clemens had seen it for the last time on
that day when the carriage waited while she went back to take a last look
into the vacant rooms They had taken a house at 14 West Tenth Street
for the winter and when summer came they went to a log cabin on
Saranac Lake which they called The Lair Here Mark Twain wrote
A Doublebarreled Detective Story a not very successful burlesque of
Sherlock Holmes But most of the time that summer he loafed and rested
as was his right Once during the summer he went on a cruise with H H
Rogers Speaker Tom Reed and others on Mr Rogerss yacht




LVI

HONORED BY MISSOURI

The family did not return to New York They took a beautiful house at
Riverdale on the Hudsonthe old Appleton homestead Here they
established themselves and settled down for American residence They
would have bought the Appleton place but the price was beyond their
reach

It was in the autumn of 1901 that Mark Twain settled in Riverdale In
June of the following year he was summoned West to receive the degree of
LLD from the university of his native state He made the journey a
sort of last general visit to old associations and friends In St Louis
he saw Horace Bixby fresh wiry and capable as he had been fortyfive
years before Clemens said

 I have become an old man You are still thirtyfive

They went over to the rooms of the pilots association where the
rivermen gathered in force to celebrate his return Then he took train
for Hannibal

He spent several days in Hannibal and saw Laura HawkinsMrs Frazer and
a widow nowand John Briggs an old man and John RoBards who had worn
the golden curls and the medal for good conduct They drove him to the
old house on Hill Street where once he had lived and set type
photographers were there and photographed him standing at the front door

It all seems so small to me he said as he looked through the house
A boys home is a big place to him I suppose if I should come back
again ten years from now it would be the size of a birdhouse He did
not see HuckTorn Blankenship had not lived in Hannibal for many
years But he was driven to all the familiar hauntsto Lovers Leap
the cave and the rest and Sunday afternoon with John Briggs he walked
over Hollidays Hillthe Cardiff Hill of Tom Sawyer It was just
such a day as the one when they had damaged a cooper shop and so nearly
finished the old negro driver A good deal more than fifty years had
passed since then and now here they were once moreTom Sawyer and Joe
Harpertwo old men the hills still fresh and green the river rippling
in the sun Looking across to the Illinois shore and the green islands
where they had played and to Lovers Leap on the south the man who had
been Sam Clemens said

John that is one of the loveliest sights I ever saw Down there is the
place we used to swim and yonder is where a man was drowned and theres
where the steamboat sank Down there on Lovers Leap is where the
Millerites put on their robes one night to go to heaven None of them
went that night but I suppose most of them have gone now

John Briggs said Sam do you remember the day we stole peaches from old
man Price and one of his bowlegged niggers came after us with dogs and
how we made up our minds wed catch that nigger and drown him

And so they talked on of this thing and that and by and by drove along
the river and Sam Clemens pointed out the place where he swam it and was
taken with a cramp on the return

Once near the shore I thought I would let down he said but was
afraid to knowing that if the water was deep I was a goner but finally
my knee struck the sand and I crawled out That was the closest call I
ever had

They drove by a place where a haunted house had stood They drank from a
well they had always knownfrom the bucket as they had always drunk
talking always talking touching with lingering fondness that most
beautiful and safest of all our possessionsthe past

Sam said John when they parted this is probably the last time we
shall meet on earth God bless you Perhaps somewhere we shall renew
our friendship

John was the answer this day has been worth a thousand dollars to
me We were like brothers once and I feel that we are the same now
Goodby John Ill try to meet you somewhere

Clemens left next day for Columbia where the university is located At
each station a crowd had gathered to cheer and wave as the train pulled
in and to offer him flowers Sometimes he tried to say a few words but
his voice would not come This was more than even Tom Sawyer had
dreamed

Certainly there is something deeply touching in the recognition of ones
native State the return of the boy who has set out unknown to battle
with life and who is called back to be crowned is unlike any other
homecomingmore dramatic more moving Next day at the university Mark
Twain summoned before the crowded assemblyhall to receive his degree
stepped out to the center of the stage and paused He seemed in doubt as
to whether he should make a speech or only express his thanks for the
honor received Suddenly and without signal the great audience rose and
stood in silence at his feet He bowed but he could not speak Then the
vast assembly began a peculiar chant spelling out slowly the word
Missouri with a pause between each letter It was tremendously
impressive

Mark Twain was not left in doubt as to what was required of him when the
chant ended The audience demanded a speecha speech and he made them
onesuch a speech as no one there would forget to his dying day

Back in St Louis he attended the rechristening of the St Louis harbor
boat it had been previously called the St Louis but it was now to be
called the Mark Twain




LVII

THE CLOSE OF A BEAUTIFUL LIFE

Life which had begun very cheerfully at Riverdale ended sadly enough In
August at York Harbor Maine Mrs Clemenss health failed and she was
brought home an invalid confined almost entirely to her room She had
been always the life the center the mainspring of the household Now
she must not even be consultedhardly visited On her bad daysand
they were manyClemens sad and anxious spent most of his time
lingering about her door waiting for news or until he was permitted to
see her for a brief moment In his memorandumbook of that period he
wrote

 Our dear prisoner is where she is through overworkday and night
 devotion to the children and me We did not know how to value it
 We know now

And on the margin of a letter praising him for what he had done for the
worlds enjoyment and for his triumph over debt he wrote

 Livy never gets her share of those applauses but it is because the
 people do not know Yet she is entitled to the lions share

She improved during the winter but very slowly Her husband wrote in
his diary

 Feb 2 1903Thirtythird wedding anniversary I was allowed to
 see Livy five minutes this morning in honor of the day

Mrs Clemens had always remembered affectionately their winter in
Florence of ten years before and she now expressed the feeling that if
she were in Florence again she would be better The doctors approved
and it was decided that she should be taken there as soon as she was
strong enough to travel She had so far improved by June that they
journeyed to Elmira where in the quiet rest of Quarry Farm her strength
returned somewhat and the hope of her recovery was strong

Mark Twain wrote a story that summer in Elmira in the little octagonal
study shut in now by trees and overgrown with vines A Dogs Tale a
pathetic plea against vivisection was the last story written in the
little retreat that had seen the beginning of Tom Sawyer twentynine
years before

There was a feeling that the stay in Europe was this time to be
permanent On one of the first days of October Clemens wrote in his
notebook

 Today I place flowers on Susys gravefor the last time probably
 and read the words Good night dear heart good night
 good night

They sailed on the 24th by way of Naples and Genoa and were presently
installed in the Villa Reale di Quarto a fine old Italian palace in an
ancient garden looking out over Florence toward Vallombrosa and the
Chianti hills It was a beautiful spot though its aging walls and
cypresses and matted vines gave it a rather mournful look Mrs
Clemenss health improved there for a time in spite of dull rainy
depressing weather so much so that in May when the warmth and sun came
back Clemens was driving about the country seeking a villa that he
might buy for a home

On one of these daysit was a Sunday in early June the 5thwhen he had
been out with Jean and had found a villa which he believed would fill
all their requirements he came home full of enthusiasm and hope eager
to tell the patient about the discovery Certainly she seemed better A
day or two before she had been wheeled out on the terrace to enjoy the
wonder of early Italian summer

He found her bright and cheerful anxious to hear all their plans for the
new home He stayed with her alone through the dinner hour and their
talk was as in the old days Summoned to go at last he chided himself
for staying so long but she said there was no harm and kissed him
saying you will come back and he answered Yes to say good night
meaning at halfpast nine as was the permitted custom He stood a
moment at the door throwing kisses to her and she returned them her
face bright with smiles

He was so full of hopethey were going to be happy again Long ago he
had been in the habit of singing jubilee songs to the children He went
upstairs now to the piano and played the chorus and sang Swing Low
Sweet Chariot and My Lord He Calls Me He stopped then but Jean
who had come in asked him to go on Mrs Clemens from her room heard
the music and said to Katy Leary

He is singing a goodnight carol to me

The music ceased presently A moment later she asked to be lifted up
Almost in that instant life slipped away without a sound

Clemens just then coming to say goodnight saw a little group gathered
about her bed and heard Clara ask

Katy is it true Oh Katy is it true

In his notebook that night he wrote

 At a quarterpast nine this evening she that was the life of my life
 passed to the relief and the peace of death after twentytwo months
 of unjust and unearned suffering I first saw her thirtyseven
 years ago and now I have looked upon her face for the last time
 I was full of remorse for things done and said in these thirty
 four years of married life that have hurt Livys heart

And to Howells a few days later

 Today treasured in her worn old testament I found a dear and
 gentle letter from you dated Far Rockaway September 12 1896 about
 our poor Susys death I am tired and old I wish I were with Livy

They brought her to America and from the house and the rooms where she
had been made a bride bore her to a grave beside Susy and little Langdon




LVIII

MARK TWAIN AT SEVENTY

In a small cottage belonging to Richard Watson Gilder at Tyringham
Massachusetts Samuel Clemens and his daughters tried to plan for the
future Mrs Clemens had always been the directing forcethey were lost
without her They finally took a house in New York City No 21 Fifth
Avenue at the corner of Ninth Street installed the familiar
furnishings and tried once more to establish a home The house was
handsome within and withouta proper residence for a venerable author
and sagea suitable setting for Mark Twain But it was lonely for him

It lacked soulcomfort that would reach the heart He added presently a
great Aeolian orchestrelle with a variety of music for his different
moods Sometimes he played it himself though oftener his secretary
played to him He went out little that winterseeing only a few old and
intimate friends His writing such as it was was of a serious nature
protests against oppression and injustice in a variety of forms Once he
wrote a War Prayer supposed to have been made by a mysterious
whiterobed stranger who enters a church during those ceremonies that
precede the marching of the nations armies to battle The minister had
prayed for victory a prayer which the stranger interprets as a petition
that the enemys country be laid waste its soldiers be torn by shells
its people turned out roofless to wander through their desolated land
in rags and hunger It was a scathing arraignment of war a prophecy
indeed which today has been literally fulfilled He did not print it
because then it would have been regarded as sacrilege

When summer came again in a beautiful house at Dublin New Hampshire on
the Monadnock slope he seemed to get back into the old swing of work
and wrote that pathetic story A Horses Tale Also Eves Diary
which under its humor is filled with tenderness and he began a wildly
fantastic tale entitled Three Thousand Years Among the Microbes a
satire in which Gulliver is outdone He never finished it He never
could finish it for it ran off into amazing bypaths that led nowhere
and the tale was lost Yet he always meant to get at it again some day
and make order out of chaos

Old friends were dying and Mark Twain grew more and more lonely My
section of the procession has but a little way to go he wrote when the
great English actor Henry Irving died Charles Henry Webb his first
publisher John Hay Bret Harte Thomas B Reed and indeed most of his
earlier associates were gone When an invitation came from San Francisco
to attend a California reunion he replied that his wandering days were
over and that it was his purpose to sit by the fire for the rest of his
life And in another letter

 I have done more for San Francisco than any other of its old
 residents Since I left there it has increased in population fully
 300000 I could have done moreI could have gone earlierit was
 suggested

A choice example by the way of Mark Twains best humor with its
perfectly timed pause and the afterthought Most humorists would have
been content to end with the statement I could have gone earlier
Only Mark Twain could have added that final exquisite touchit was
suggested

Mark Twain was nearing seventy With the 30th of November 1905 he
would complete the scriptural limitation and the president of his
publishinghouse Col George Harvey of Harpers proposed a great
dinner for him in celebration of his grand maturity Clemens would have
preferred a small assembly in some snug place with only his oldest and
closest friends Colonel Harvey had a different view He had given a
small choice dinner to Mark Twain on his sixtyseventh birthday now it
must be something really worth whilesomething to outrank any former
literary gathering In order not to conflict with Thanksgiving holidays
the 5th of December was selected as the date On that evening two
hundred American and English men and women of letters assembled in
Delmonicos great banquethall to do honor to their chief What an
occasion it was The tables of gay diners and among them Mark Twain his
snowwhite hair a gleaming beacon for every eye Then by and by
presented by William Dean Howells he rose to speak Instantly the
brilliant throng was on its feet a shouting billow of life the white
handkerchiefs flying foamlike on its crest It was a supreme moment
The greatest one of them all hailed by their applause as he scaled the
mountaintop

Never did Mark Twain deliver a more perfect address than he gave that
night He began with the beginning the meagerness of that little hamlet
that had seen his birth and sketched it all so quaintly and delightfully
that his hearers laughed and shouted though there was tenderness under
it and often the tears were just beneath the surface He told of his
habits of life how he had reached seventy by following a plan of living
that would probably kill anybody else how in fact he believed he had
no valuable habits at all Then at last came that unforgetable close

 Threescore years and ten

 It is the scriptural statute of limitations After that you owe no
 active duties for you the strenuous life is over You are a time
 expired man to use Kiplings military phrase you have served your
 term well or less well and you are mustered out You are become
 an honorary member of the republic you are emancipated compulsions
 are not for you nor any buglecall but lights out You pay the
 timeworn duty bills if you choose or decline if you preferand
 without prejudicefor they are not legally collectable

 The previousengagement plea which in forty years has cost you so
 many twinges you can lay aside forever on this side of the grave
 you will never need it again If you shrink at thought of night
 and winter and the late homecomings from the banquet and the lights
 and laughter through the deserted streetsa desolation which would
 not remind you now as for a generation it did that your friends
 are sleeping and you must creep in atiptoe and not disturb them
 but would only remind you that you need not tiptoe you can never
 disturb them moreif you shrink at the thought of these things you
 need only reply Your invitation honors me and pleases me because
 you still keep me in your remembrance but I am seventy seventy
 and would nestle in the chimneycorner and smoke my pipe and read
 my book and take my rest wishing you well in all affection and
 that when you in your turn shall arrive at Pier 70 you may step
 aboard your waiting ship with a reconciled spirit and lay your
 course toward the sinking sun with a contented heart

The tears that had been lying in wait were no longer kept back If there
were any present who did not let them flow without shame who did not
shout their applause from throats choked with sobs they failed to
mention the fact later

Many of his old friends one after another rose to tell their love for
himCable Carnegie Gilder and the rest Mr Rogers did not speak
nor the Reverend Twichell but they sat at his special table Aldrich
could not be there but wrote a letter A group of English authors
including Alfred Austin Barrie Chesterton Dobson Doyle Hardy
Kipling Lang and others joined in a cable Helen Keller wrote

 And you are seventy years old Or is the report exaggerated like
 that of your death I remember when I saw you last at the house
 of dear Mr Hutton in Princeton you said

 If a man is a pessimist before he is fortyeight he knows too
 much If he is an optimist after he is fortyeight he knows too
 little

 Now we know you are an optimist and nobody would dare to accuse one
 on the seventerraced summit of knowing little So probably you
 are not seventy after all but only fortyseven

Helen Keller was right Mark Twain was never a pessimist in his heart




LIX

MARK TWAIN ARRANGES FOR HIS BIOGRAPHY

It was at the beginning of 1906a little more than a month after the
seventiethbirthday dinnerthat the writer of these chapters became
personally associated with Mark Twain I had met him before and from
time to time he had returned a kindly word about some book I had written
and inconsiderately sent him for he had been my literary hero from
childhood Once indeed he had allowed me to use some of his letters in
a biography I was writing of Thomas Nast he had been always an admirer
of the great cartoonist and the permission was kindness itself Before
the seating at the birthday dinner I happened to find myself for a moment
alone with Mark Twain and remembered to thank him in person for the use
of the letters a day or two later I sent him a copy of the book I did
not expect to hear from it again

It was a little while after this that I was asked to join in a small
private dinner to be given to Mark Twain at the Players in celebration
of his being made an honorary member of that clubthere being at the
time only one other member of this class Sir Henry Irving I was in the
Players a day or two before the event and David Munro of The North
American Review a man whose gentle and kindly nature made him David
to all who knew him greeted me joyfully his face full of something he
knew I would wish to hear

He had been chosen he said to propose the Players dinner to Mark
Twain and had found him propped up in bed and beside him a copy of the
Nast book I suspect now that Davids generous heart prompted Mark Twain
to speak of the book and that his comment had lost nothing in Davids
eager retelling But I was too proud and happy to question any feature
of the precious compliment and Munroalways most happy in making others
happyfound opportunity to repeat it and even to improve upon it
usually in the presence of othersseveral times during the evening

The Players dinner to Mark Twain was given on the evening of January 3
19066 and the picture of it still remains clear to me The guests
assembled around a single table in the private diningroom did not
exceed twentyfive in number Brander Matthews presided and the
knightly Frank Millet who would one day go down on the Titanic was
there and Gilder and Munro and David Bispham and Robert Reid and others
of their kind It so happened that my seat was nearly facing the guest
of the evening who by a custom of the Players is placed at the side and
not at the distant end of the long table Regarding him at leisure I
saw that he seemed to be in full health He had an alert rested look
his complexion had the tints of a miniature painting Lit by the soft
glow of the shaded candles outlined against the richness of the shadowed
walls he made a figure of striking beauty I could not take my eyes
from it for it stirred in me the farthest memories I saw the interior
of a farmhouse sittingroom in the Middle West where I had first heard
the name of Mark Twain and where night after night a group had gathered
around the evening lamp to hear read aloud the story of the Innocents on
their Holy Land pilgrimage which to a boy of eight had seemed only a
wonderful poem and fairytale To Charles Harvey Genung who sat next to
me I whispered something of this and how during the thirtysix years
since then no one had meant to me quite what Mark Twain had meantin
literature and indeed in life Now here he was just across the table
It was a fairytale come true

Genung said You should write his life

It seemed to me no more than a pleasant remark but he came back to it
again and again trying to encourage me with the word that Munro had
brought back concerning the biography of Nast However nothing of what
he said had kindled any spark of hope I put him off by saying that
certainly some one of longer and closer friendship and larger experience
had been selected for the work Then the speaking began and the matter
went out of my mind Later in the evening when we had left our seats
and were drifting about the table I found a chance to say a word to our
guest concerning his Joan of Arc which I had recently reread To my
happiness he told me that longago incidentthe stray leaf from Joans
life blown to him by the windwhich had led to his interest in all
literature Then presently I was with Genung again and he was still
insisting that I write the life of Mark Twain It may have been his
faithful urging it may have been the quick sympathy kindled by the name
of Joan of Arc whatever it was in the instant of bidding goodby to
our guest I was prompted to add

May I call to see you Mr Clemens some day And somethingto this
day I do not know whatprompted him to answer

Yes come soon

Two days later by appointment with his secretary I arrived at 21 Fifth
Avenue and waited in the library to be summoned to his room A few
moments later I was ascending the long stairs wondering why I had come
on so useless an errand trying to think up an excuse for having come at
all

He was propped up in beda regal bed from a dismantled Italian palace
delving through a copy of Huckleberry Finn in search of a paragraph
concerning which some unknown correspondent had inquired He pushed the
cigars toward me commenting amusingly on this correspondent and on
letterwriting in general By and by when there came a lull I told him
what so many thousands had told him beforewhat his work had meant to
me so long ago and recalled my childish impressions of that large
blackandgilt book with its wonderful pictures and adventures The
Innocents Abroad Very likely he was willing enough to let me change
the subject presently and thank him for the kindly word which David Munro
had brought I do not remember what was his comment but I suddenly
found myself saying that out of his encouragement had grown a hope
though certainly it was less that I might some day undertake a book
about himself I expected my errand to end at this point and his
silence seemed long and ominous

He said at last that from time to time he had himself written chapters of
his life but that he had always tired of the work and put it aside He
added that he hoped his daughters would one day collect his letters but
that a biographya detailed story of a mans life and effortwas
another matter I think he added one or two other remarks then all at
once turning upon me those piercing agateblue eyes he said

When would you like to begin

There was a dresser with a large mirror at the end of the room I
happened to catch my reflection in it and I vividly recollect saying to
it mentally This is not true it is only one of many similar dreams
But even in a dream one must answer and I said

Whenever you like I can begin now

He was always eager in any new undertaking

Very good he said the sooner then the better Lets begin while
we are in the humor The longer you postpone a thing of this kind the
less likely you are ever to get at it

This was on Saturday I asked if Tuesday January 9 would be too soon
to start He agreed that Tuesday would do and inquired as to my plan
of work I suggested bringing a stenographer to make notes of his
lifestory as he could recall it this record to be supplemented by
other materialletters journals and what not He said

I think I should enjoy dictating to a stenographer with some one to
prompt me and act as audience The room adjoining this was fitted up for
my study My manuscript and notes and private books and many of my
letters are there and there are a trunkful or two of such things in the
attic I seldom use the room myself I do my writing and reading in
bed I will turn that room over to you for this work Whatever you need
will be brought to you We can have the dictations here in the morning
and you can put in the rest of the day to suit yourself You can have a
key and come and go as you please

That was always his way He did nothing by halves He got up and showed
me the warm luxury of the study with its mass of materialdisordered
but priceless

I have no distinct recollections of how I came away but presently back
at the Players I was confiding the matter to Charles Harvey Genung who
said he was not surprised but I think he was

WORKING WITH MARK TWAIN

It was true after all and on Tuesday morning January 9 1906 I was on
hand with a capable stenographer ready to begin Clemens meantime had
developed a new idea he would like to add he said the new dictations
to his former beginnings completing an autobiography which was to be
laid away and remain unpublished for a hundred years He would pay the
stenographer himself and own the notes allowing me of course free use
of them as material for my book He did not believe that he could follow
the story of his life in its order of dates but would find it necessary
to wander around picking up the thread as memory or fancy prompted I
could suggest subjects and ask questions I assented to everything and
we set to work immediately

As on my former visit he was in bed when we arrived though clad now in
a rich Persian dressing gown and propped against great snowy pillows
A small table beside him held his pipes cigars papers also a
readinglamp the soft light of which brought out his brilliant coloring
and the gleam of his snowy hair There was daylight too but it was dull
winter daylight from the north while the walls of the room were a deep
unreflecting red

He began that morning with some memories of the Comstock mine then he
dropped back to his childhood closing at last with some comment on
matters quite recent How delightful it washis quaint unhurried
fashion of speech the unconscious habits of his delicate hands the play
of his features as his fancies and phrases passed through his mind and
were accepted or put aside We were watching one of the great literary
creators of his time in the very process of his architecture Time did
not count When he finished at last we were all amazed to find that
more than two hours had slipped away

And how much I have enjoyed it he said It is the ideal plan for
this kind of work Narrative writing is always disappointing The
moment you pick up a pen you begin to lose the spontaneity of the
personal relation which contains the very essence of interest With
shorthand dictation one can talk as if he were at his own dinnertable
always an inspiring place I expect to dictate all the rest of my life
if you good people are willing to come and listen to it

The dictations thus begun continued steadily from week to week with
increasing charm We never knew what he was going to talk about and it
was seldom that he knew until the moment of beginning But it was always
fascinating and I felt myself the most fortunate biographer in the
world as indeed I was

It was not all smooth sailing however In the course of time I began to
realize that these marvelous dictated chapters were not altogether
history but were often partly or even entirely imaginary The creator
of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn had been embroidering old incidents or
inventing new ones too long to stick to history now to be able to
separate the romance in his mind from the reality of the past Also his
memory of personal events had become inaccurate He realized this and
once said in his whimsical gentle way

 When I was younger I could remember anything whether it happened
 or not but I am getting old and soon I shall remember only the
 latter

Yet it was his constant purpose to stick to fact and especially did he
make no effort to put himself in a good light Indeed if you wanted to
know the worst of Mark Twain you had only to ask him for it He would
give it to the last syllable and he would improve upon it and pile up
his sins and sometimes the sins of others without stint Certainly the
dictations were precious for they revealed character as nothing else
could but as material for history they often failed to stand the test of
the documents in the next roomthe letters notebooks agreements and
the likefrom which I was gradually rebuilding the structure of the
years

In the talks that we usually had when the dictations were ended and the
stenographer had gone I got much that was of great value It was then
that I usually made those inquiries which we had planned in the
beginning and his answers coming quickly and without reflection gave
imagination less play Sometimes he would touch some point of special
interest and walk up and down philosophizing or commenting upon things
in general in a manner not always complimentary to humanity and its
progress

I seldom asked him a question during the dictationor interrupted in any
way though he had asked me to stop him when I found him repeating or
contradicting himself or misstating some fact known to me At first I
lacked the courage to point out a mistake at the moment and cautiously
mentioned the matter when he had finished Then he would be likely to
say

 Why didnt you stop me Why did you let me go on making a donkey
 of myself when you could have saved me

So then I used to take the risk of getting struck by lightning and
nearly always stopped him in time But if it happened that I upset his
thought the thunderbolt was apt to fly He would say

 Now youve knocked everything out of my head

Then of course I was sorry and apologized and in a moment the sky was
clear again There was generally a humorous complexion to the
dictations whatever the subject Humor was his natural breath of life
and rarely absent

Perhaps I should have said sooner that he smoked continuously during the
dictations His cigars were of that delicious fragrance which belongs to
domestic tobacco They were strong and inexpensive and it was only his
early training that made him prefer them Admiring friends used to send
him costly imported cigars but he rarely touched them and they were
smoked by visitors He often smoked a pipe and preferred it to be old
and violent Once when he had bought a new expensive briarroot he
handed it to me saying

Id like to have you smoke that a year or two and when it gets so you
cant stand it maybe it will suit me

DICTATIONS AT DUBLIN N H

Following his birthday dinner Mark Twain had become once more the Belle
of New York and in a larger way than ever before An editorial in the
Evening Mail referred to him as a kind of joint Aristides Solon and
Themistocles of the American metropolis and added

 Things have reached a point where if Mark Twain is not at a public
 meeting or banquet he is expected to console it with one of his
 inimitable letters of advice and encouragement

He loved the excitement of it and it no longer seemed to wear upon him
Scarcely an evening passed that he did not go out to some dinner or
gathering where he had promised to speak In April for the benefit of
the Robert Fulton Society he delivered his farewell lecturethe last
lecture he said where any one would have to pay to hear him It was at
Carnegie Hall and the great place was jammed As he stood before that
vast shouting audience I wondered if he was remembering that night
forty years before in San Francisco when his lecture career had begun
We hoped he might speak of it but he did not do so

In May the dictations were transferred to Dublin New Hampshire to the
long veranda of the Upton House on the Monadnock slope He wished to
continue our work he said so the stenographer and myself were presently
located in the village and drove out each morning to sit facing one of
the rarest views in all New England while he talked of everything and
anything that memory or fancy suggested We had begun in his bedroom
but the glorious outside was too compelling

The long veranda was ideal He was generally ready when we arrived a
luminous figure in white flannels pacing up and down before a background
of sky and forest blue lake and distant hills When it stormed we
would go inside to a bright fire The dictation ended he would ask his
secretary to play the orchestrelle which at great expense had been
freighted up from New York In that high situation the fire and the
music and the stormbeat seemed to lift us very far indeed from reality
Certain symphonies by Beethoven an impromptu by Schubert and a nocturne
by Chopin were the selections he cared for most12 though in certain
moods he asked for the Scotch melodies

There was a good deal of social life in Dublin but the dictations were
seldom interrupted He became lonely now and then and paid a brief
visit to New York or to Mr Rogers in Fairhaven but he always returned
gladly for he liked the rest and quiet and the dictations gave him
employment A part of his entertainment was a trio of kittens which he
had rented for the summerrented because then they would not lose
ownership and would find home and protection in the fall He named the
kittens Sackcloth and AshesSackcloth being a blackandwhite kit and
Ashes a joint name owned by the two others who were gray and exactly
alike All summer long these merry little creatures played up and down
the wide veranda or chased butterflies and grasshoppers down the clover
slope offering Mark Twain neverending amusement He loved to see them
spring into the air after some insect miss it tumble back and quickly
jump up again with a surprised and disappointed expression

In spite of his resolve not to print any of his autobiography until he
had been dead a hundred years he was persuaded during the summer to
allow certain chapters of it to be published in The North American
Review With the price received thirty thousand dollars he announced
he was going to build himself a country home at Redding Connecticut on
land already purchased there near a small country place of my own He
wished to have a fixed place to go each summer he said and his thought
was to call it Autobiography House

12 His special favorites were Schuberts Op 142 part 2 and Chopins
Op 37 part 2

A NEW ERA OF BILLIARDS

With the return to New York I began a period of closer association with
Mark Twain Up to that time our relations had been chiefly of a literary
nature They now became personal as well

It happened in this way Mark Twain had never outgrown his love for the
game of billiards though he had not owned a table since the closing of
the Hartford house fifteen years before Mrs Henry Rogers had proposed
to present him with a table for Christmas but when he heard of the plan
boylike he could not wait and hinted that if he had the table right
now he could begin to use it sooner So the table camea handsome
combination affair suitable to all gamesand was set in place That
morning when the dictation ended he said

Have you any special place to lunch today

I replied that I had not

Lunch here he said and well try the new billiardtable

I acknowledged that I had never played more than a few games of pool and
those very long ago

No matter he said the poorer you play the better I shall like it

So I remained for luncheon and when it was over we began the first game
ever played on the Christmas table He taught me a game in which
caroms and pockets both counted and he gave me heavy odds He beat me
but it was a riotous rollicking game the beginning of a closer relation
between us We played most of the afternoon and he suggested that I
come back in the evening and play some more I did so and the game
lasted till after midnight I had beginners lucknigger luck as he
called itand it kept him working feverishly to win Once when I had
made a great flukea carom followed by most of the balls falling into
the pockets he said

 When you pick up that cue this table drips at every pore

The morning dictations became a secondary interest Like a boy he was
looking forward to the afternoon of play and it seemed never to come
quickly enough to suit him I remained regularly for luncheon and he
was inclined to cut the courses short that we might the sooner get
upstairs for billiards He did not eat the midday meal himself but he
would come down and walk about the diningroom talking steadily that
marvelous marvelous talk which little by little I trained myself to
remember though never with complete success He was only killing time
and I remember once when he had been earnestly discussing some deep
question he suddenly noticed that the luncheon was ending

Now he said we will proceed to more serious mattersits your
shot

My game improved with practice and he reduced my odds He was willing
to be beaten but not too often We kept a record of the games and he
went to bed happier if the tallysheet showed a balance in his favor

He was not an eventempered player When the game went steadily against
him he was likely to become critical even faultfinding in his remarks
Then presently he would be seized with remorse and become overgentle and
attentive placing the balls as I knocked them into the pockets hurrying
to render this service I wished he would not do it It distressed me
that he should humble himself I was willing that he should lose his
temper that he should be even harsh if he felt so inclinedhis age his
position his genius gave him special privileges Yet I am glad as I
remember it now that the other side revealed itself for it completes
the sum of his humanity Once in a burst of exasperation he made such an
onslaught on the balls that he landed a couple of them on the floor I
gathered them up and we went on playing as if nothing had happened only
he was very gentle and sweet like a summer meadow when the storm has
passed by Presently he said

 This is a most amusing game When you play badly it amuses me and
 when I play badly and lose my temper it certainly must amuse you

It was but natural that friendship should grow under such conditions
The disparity of our ages and gifts no longer mattered The pleasant
land of play is a democracy where such things do not count

We celebrated his seventyfirst birthday by playing billiards all day
He invented a new game for the occasion and added a new rule for it with
almost every shot It happened that no other member of the family was at
homeillhealth had banished every one even the secretary Flowers
telegrams and congratulations came and a string of callers He saw no
one but a few intimate friends

We were entirely alone for dinner and I felt the great honor of being
his only guest on such an occasion On that night a year before the
flower of his profession had assembled to do him honor Once between the
courses when he rose as was his habit to walk about he wandered into
the drawingroom and seating himself at the orchestrelle began to play
the beautiful Flower Song from Faust It was a thing I had not seen
him do before and I never saw him do it again

He was in his loveliest humor all that day and evening and at night when
we stopped playing he said

I have never had a pleasanter day at this game

I answered I hope ten years from tonight we shall be playing it

Yes he said still playing the best game on earth




LXIII

LIVING WITH MARK TWAIN

I accompanied him on a trip he made to Washington in the interest of
copyright Speaker Uncle Joe Cannon lent us his private room in the
Capitol and there all one afternoon Mark Twain received Congressmen and
in an atmosphere blue with cigarsmoke preached the gospel of copyright
It was a historic trip and for me an eventful one for it was on the way
back to New York that Mark Twain suggested that I take up residence in
his home There was a room going to waste he said and I would be
handier for the early and late billiard sessions I accepted of course

Looking back now I see pretty vividly three quite distinct pictures
One of them the rich red interior of the billiardroom with the
brilliant green square in the center on which the gay balls are rolling
and bent over it his luminous white figure in the instant of play Then
there is the long lighted drawingroom with the same figure stretched on
a couch in the corner drowsily smoking while the rich organ tones summon
for him scenes and faces which the others do not see Sometimes he rose
pacing the length of the parlors but oftener he lay among the cushions
the light flooding his white hair and dress heightening his brilliant
coloring He had taken up the fashion of wearing white altogether at
this time Black he said reminded him of his funerals

The third picture is that of the dinnertablealways beautifully laid
and always a shrine of wisdom when he was there He did not always talk
but he often did and I see him clearest his face alive with interest
presenting some new angle of thought in his vivid inimitable speech
These are pictures that will not fade from my memory How I wish the
marvelous things he said were like them I preserved as much of them as
I could and in time trained myself to recall portions of his exact
phrasing But even so they seemed never quite as he had said them They
lacked the breath of his personality His dinnertable talk was likely
to be political scientific philosophic He often discussed aspects of
astronomy which was a passion with him I could succeed better with the
billiardroom talkthat was likely to be reminiscent full of anecdotes
I kept a pad on the windowsill and made notes while he was playing At
one time he told me of his dreams

There is never a month passes he said that I do not dream of being
in reduced circumstances and obliged to go back to the river to earn a
living Usually in my dream I am just about to start into a black shadow
without being able to tell whether it is Selma Bluff or Hat Island or
only a black wall of night Another dream I have is being compelled to
go back to the lecture platform In it I am always getting up before an
audience with nothing to say trying to be funny trying to make the
audience laugh realizing I am only making silly jokes Then the
audience realizes it and pretty soon they commence to get up and leave
That dream always ends by my standing there in the semidarkness talking
to an empty house

He did not return to Dublin the next summer but took a house at Tuxedo
nearer New York I did not go there with him for in the spring it was
agreed that I should make a pilgrimage to the Mississippi and the Pacific
coast to see those few still remaining who had known Mark Twain in his
youth John Briggs was alive also Horace Bixby Joe Goodman Steve
and Jim Gillis and there were a few others

It was a trip taken none too soon John Briggs a gentlehearted old man
who sat by his fire and through one afternoon told me of the happy days
along the riverfront from the cave to Hollidays Hill did not reach the
end of the year Horace Bixby at eightyone was still young and
piloting a government snagboat Neither was Joseph Goodman old by any
means but Jim Gillis was near his end and Steve Gillis was an invalid
who said

Tell Sam Im going to die pretty soon but that I love him that Ive
loved him all my life and Ill love him till I die




LXIV

A DEGREE FROM OXFORD

On my return I found Mark Twain elated he had been invited to England to
receive the degree of Literary Doctor from the Oxford University It is
the highest scholastic honorary degree and to come back as I had from
following the early wanderings of the barefoot truant of Hannibal only
to find him about to be officially knighted by the worlds most venerable
institution of learning seemed rather the most surprising chapter even
of his marvelous fairytale If Tom Sawyer had owned the magic wand he
hardly could have produced anything as startling as that

He sailed on the 8th of June 1907 exactly forty years from the day he
had sailed on the Quaker City to win his greater fame I did not
accompany him He took with him a secretary to make notes and my
affairs held me in America He was absent six weeks and no attentions
that England had ever paid him before could compare with her lavish
welcome during this visit His reception was really national He was
banqueted by the greatest clubs of London he was received with special
favor at the Kings garden party he traveled by a royal train crowds
gathering everywhere to see him pass At Oxford when he appeared on the
street the name Mark Twain ran up and down like a cry of fire and the
people came running When he appeared on the stage at the Sheldonian
Theater to receive his degree clad in his doctors robe of scarlet and
gray there arose a great tumultthe shouting of the undergraduates for
the boy who had been Tom Sawyer and had played with Huckleberry Finn
The papers next day spoke of his reception as a cyclone surpassing any
other welcome though Rudyard Kipling was one of those who received
degrees on that occasion and General Booth and Whitelaw Reid and other
famous men

Perhaps the most distinguished social honor paid to Mark Twain at this
time was the dinner given him by the staff of London Punch in the
historic Punch editorial rooms on Bouverie Street No other foreigner
had ever been invited to that sacred board where Thackeray had sat and
Douglas Jerrold and others of the great departed Punch had already
saluted him with a frontpage cartoon and at this dinner the original
drawing was presented to him by the editors little daughter Joy Agnew

The Oxford degree and the splendid homage paid him by England at large
became as it were the crowning episode of Mark Twains career I think
he realized this although he did not speak of itindeed he had very
little to say of the whole matter I telephoned a greeting when I knew
that he had arrived in New York and was summoned to come down and play
billiards I confess I went with a good deal of awe prepared to sit in
silence and listen to the tale of the returning hero But when I arrived
he was already in the billiardroom knocking the balls abouthis coat
off for it was a hot night As I entered he said

 Get your cueIve been inventing a new game

That was all The pageant was over the curtain was rung down Business
was resumed at the old stand




LXV

THE REMOVAL TO REDDING

There followed another winter during which I was much with Mark Twain
though a part of it he spent with Mr Rogers in Bermuda that pretty
island resort which both men loved Then came spring again and June
and with it Mark Twains removal to his newly built home Stormfield
at Redding Connecticut

The house had been under construction for a year He had never seen it
never even seen the land I had bought for him He even preferred not to
look at any plans or ideas for decoration

When the house is finished and furnished and the cat is purring on the
hearth it will be time enough for me to see it he had said more than
once

He had only specified that the rooms should be large and that the
billiardroom should be red His billiardrooms thus far had been of
that color and their memory was associated in his mind with enjoyment
and comfort He detested details of preparation and then too he
looked forward to the dramatic surprise of walking into a home that had
been conjured into existence as with a word

It was the 18th of June 1908 that he finally took possession The
Fifth Avenue house was not dismantled for it was the plan then to use
Stormfield only as a summer place The servants however with one
exception had been transferred to Redding and Mark Twain and I remained
alone though not lonely in the city house playing billiards most of
the time and being as hilarious as we pleased for there was nobody to
disturb I think he hardly mentioned the new home during that time He
had never seen even a photograph of the place and I confess I had
moments of anxiety for I had selected the site and had been more or less
concerned otherwise though John Howells was wholly responsible for the
building I did not really worry for I knew how beautiful and peaceful
it all was

The morning of the 18th was bright and sunny and cool Mark Twain was up
and shaved by six oclock in order to be in time The train did not
leave until four in the afternoon but our last billiards in town must
begin early and suffer no interruption We were still playing when
about three word was brought up that the cab was waiting Arrived at
the station a group collected reporters and others to speed him to his
new home Some of the reporters came along

The scenery was at its best that day and he spoke of it approvingly
The hour and a half required to cover the sixty miles distance seemed
short The train porters came to carry out the bags He drew from his
pocket a great handful of silver

Give them something he said give everybody liberally that does any
service

There was a sort of openair reception in waitinga varied assemblage of
vehicles festooned with flowers had gathered to offer gallant country
welcome It was a perfect June evening still and dreamlike there
seemed a spell of silence on everything The people did not cheerthey
smiled and waved to the white figure and he smiled and waved reply but
there was no noise It was like a scene in a cinema

His carriage led the way on the threemile drive to the house on the
hilltop and the floral procession fell in behind Hillsides were green
fields were white with daisies dogwood and laurel shone among the trees
He was very quiet as we drove along Once with gentle humor looking
out over a white daisyfield he said

 That is buckwheat I always recognize buckwheat when I see it I
 wish I knew as much about other things as I know about buckwheat

The clearrunning brooks a swiftflowing river a tumbling cascade where
we climbed a hill all came in for his approvalthen we were at the lane
that led to his new home and the procession behind dropped away The
carriage ascended still higher and a view opened across the Saugatuck
Valley with its nestling village and churchspire and farmhouses and
beyond them the distant hills Then came the housesimple in design
but beautifulan Italian villa such as he had known in Florence
adapted here to American climate and needs

At the entrance his domestic staff waited to greet him and presently he
stepped across the threshold and stood in his own home for the first time
in seventeen years Nothing was lackingit was as finished as
completely furnished as if he had occupied it a lifetime No one spoke
immediately but when his eyes had taken in the harmony of the place
with its restful homelike comfort and followed through the open French
windows to the distant vista of treetops and farmsides and blue hills
he said very gently

 How beautiful it all is I did not think it could be as beautiful
 as this And later when he had seen all of the apartments It is
 a perfect houseperfect so far as I can see in every detail It
 might have been here always

There were guests that first eveninga small home dinnerpartyand a
little later at the foot of the garden some fireworks were set off by
neighbors inspired by Dan Beard who had recently located in Redding
Mark Twain watching the rockets that announced his arrival said
gently

 I wonder why they go to so much trouble for me I never go to any
 trouble for anybody

The evening closed with billiards hilarious games and when at midnight
the cues were set in the rack no one could say that Mark Twains first
day in his new home had not been a happy one




LXVI

LIFE AT STORMFIELD

Mark Twain loved Stormfield Almost immediately he gave up the idea of
going back to New York for the winter and I think he never entered the
Fifth Avenue house again The quiet and undisturbed comfort of
Stormfield came to him at the right time of life His day of being the
Belle of New York was over Now and then he attended some great
dinner but always under protest Finally he refused to go at all He
had much company during that first summerold friends and now and again
young people of whom he was always fond The billiardroom he called
the aquarium and a frieze of Bermuda fishes in gay prints ran around
the walls Each young lady visitor was allowed to select one of these as
her patron fish and attach her name to it Thus as a member of the
aquarium club she was represented in absence Of course there were
several cats at Stormfield and these really owned the premises The
kittens scampered about the billiardtable after the balls even when the
game was in progress giving all sorts of new angles to the shots This
delighted him and he would not for anything have discommoded or removed
one of those furry hazards

My own house was a little more than half a mile away our lands joining
and daily I went up to visit himto play billiards or to take a walk
across the fields There was a stenographer in the neighborhood and he
continued his dictations but not regularly He wrote too now and
then and finished the little book called Is Shakespeare Dead

Winter came The walks were fewer and there was even more company the
house was gay and the billiard games protracted In February I made a
trip to Europe and the Mediterranean to go over some of his ground
there Returning in April I found him somewhat changed It was not
that he had grown older or less full of life but only less active less
eager for gay company and he no longer dictated or very rarely His
daughter Jean who had been in a health resort was coming home to act as
his secretary and this made him very happy We resumed our games our
talks and our long walks across the fields There were few guests and
we were together most of the day and evening How beautiful the memory
of it all is now To me of course nothing can ever be like it again in
this world

Mark Twain walked slowly these days Early in the summer there appeared
indications of the heart trouble that less than a year later would bring
the end His doctor advised diminished smoking and forbade the old
habit of lightly skipping up and down stairs The trouble was with the
heart muscles and at times there came severe deadly pains in his breast
but for the most part he did not suffer He was allowed the walk
however and once I showed him a part of his estate he had not seen
beforea remote cedar hillside On the way I pointed out a little
corner of land which earlier he had given me to straighten our division
line I told him I was going to build a study on it and call it
Markland I think the name pleased him Later he said

If you had a place for that extra billiardtable of mine the Rogers
table which had been left in storage in New York I would turn it over
to you

I replied that I could adapt the size of my proposed study to fit the
table and he said

Now that will be very good Then when I want exercise I can walk down
and play billiards with you and when you want exercise you can walk up
and play billiards with me You must build that study

So it was planned and the work was presently under way

How many things we talked of Life death the futureall the things of
which we know so little and love so much to talk about Astronomy as I
have said was one of his favorite subjects Neither of us had any real
knowledge of the matter which made its great facts all the more awesome
The thought that the nearest fixed star was twentyfive trillions of
miles awaytwo hundred and fifty thousand times the distance to our own
remote sungave him a sort of splendid thrill He would figure out
those appalling measurements of space covering sheets of paper with his
sums but he was not a good mathematician and the answers were generally
wrong Comets in particular interested him and one day he said

 I came in with Halleys comet in 1835 It is coming again next
 year and I expect to go out with it It will be the greatest
 disappointment of my life if I dont go out with Halleys comet

He looked so strong and full of color and vitality One could not
believe that his words held a prophecy Yet the pains recurred with
increasing frequency and severity his malady angina pectoris was
making progress And how bravely he bore it all He never complained
never bewailed I have seen the fierce attack crumple him when we were
at billiards but he would insist on playing in his turn bowed his face
white his hand digging at his breast




LXVII

THE DEATH OF JEAN

Clara Clemens was married that autumn to Ossip Gabrilowitsch the Russian
pianist and presently sailed for Europe where they would make their
home Jean Clemens was now head of the house and what with her various
duties and poor health her burden was too heavy She had a passion for
animal life of every kind and in some farmbuildings at one corner of
the estate had set up quite an establishment of chickens and domestic
animals She was fond of giving these her personal attention and this
with her house direction and secretarial work gave her little time for
rest I tried to relieve her of a share of the secretarial work but she
was ambitious and faithful Still her condition did not seem critical

I stayed at Stormfield now most of the timenights as well as days
for the dull weather had come and Mark Twain found the house rather
lonely In November he had an impulse to go to Bermuda and we spent a
month in the warm light of that summer island returning a week before
the Christmas holidays And just then came Mark Twains last great
tragedythe death of his daughter Jean

The holidays had added heavily to Jeans labors Out of her generous
heart she had planned gifts for everybodyhad hurried to and from the
city for her purchases and in the loggia set up a beautiful Christmas
tree Meantime she had contracted a heavy cold Her trouble was
epilepsy and all this was bad for her On the morning of December 24
she died suddenly from the shock of a cold bath

Below in the loggia drenched with tinsel stood the tree and heaped
about it the packages of gifts which that day she had meant to open and
put in place Nobody had been overlooked

Jean was taken to Elmira for burial Her father unable to make the
winter journey remained behind Her cousin Jervis Langdon came for
her

It was six in the evening when she went away A soft heavy snow was
falling and the gloom of the short day was closing in There was not
the least noise the whole world was muffled The lanterns shone out the
open door and at an upper window the light gleaming on his white hair
her father watched her going away from him for the last time Later he
wrote

 From my window I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the
 road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow and
 presently disappear Jean was gone out of my life and would not
 come back any more The cousin she had played with when they were
 babies togetherhe and her beloved old Katywere conducting her to
 her distant childhood home where she will lie by her mothers side
 once more in the company of Susy and Langdon




LXVIII

DAYS IN BERMUDA

Ten days later Mark Twain returned to Bermuda accompanied only by a
valet He had asked me if we would be willing to close our home for the
winter and come to Stormfield so that the place might be ready any time
for his return We came of course for there was no thought other than
for his comfort He did not go to a hotel in Bermuda but to the home of
ViceConsul Allen where he had visited before The Allens were devoted
to him and gave him such care as no hotel could offer

Bermuda agreed with Mark Twain and for a time there he gained in
strength and spirits and recovered much of his old manner He wrote me
almost daily generally with good reports of his health and doings and
with playful counsel and suggestions Then by and by he did not write
with his own hand but through his newly appointed secretary Mr
Allens young daughter Helen of whom he was very fond The letters
however were still gay Once he said

 While the matter is in my mind I will remark that if you ever send
 me another letter which is not paged at the top I will write you
 with my own hand so that I may use in utter freedom and without
 embarrassment the kind of words which alone can describe such a
 criminal

He had made no mention so far of the pains in his breast but near the
end of March he wrote that he was coming home if the breast pains did
not mend their ways pretty considerable I do not want to die here he
said I am growing more and more particular about the place A week
later brought another alarming letter also one from Mr Allen who
frankly stated that matters had become very serious indeed I went to
New York and sailed the next morning cabling the Gabrilowitsches to come
without delay

I sent no word to Bermuda that I was coming and when I arrived he was
not expecting me

Why he said holding out his hand you did not tell us you were
coming

No I said it is rather sudden I didnt quite like the sound of
your last letters

But those were not serious You shouldnt have come on my account

I said then that I had come on my own account that I had felt the need
of recreation and had decided to run down and come home with him

Thatsverygood he said in his slow gentle fashion Wow Im
glad to see you

His breakfast came in and he ate with appetite I had thought him thin
and pale at first sight but his color had come back now and his eyes
were bright He told me of the fierce attacks of the pain and how he
had been given hypodermic injections which he amusingly termed hypnotic
injunctions and the subcutaneous From Mr and Mrs Allen I learned
how slender had been his chances and how uncertain were the days ahead
Mr Allen had already engaged passage home for April 12th

He seemed so little like a man whose days were numbered On the
afternoon of my arrival we drove out as we had done on our former visit
and he discussed some of the old subjects in quite the old way I had
sold for him for six thousand dollars the farm where Jean had kept her
animals and he wished to use the money in erecting for her some sort of
memorial He agreed that a building to hold the library which he had
already donated to the town of Redding would be appropriate and useful
He asked me to write at once to his lawyer and have the matter arranged

We did not drive out again The pains held off for several days and he
was gay and went out on the lawn but most of the time he sat propped up
in bed reading and smoking When I looked at him there so full of
vigor and the joy of life I could not persuade myself that he would not
outlive us all

He had written very little in Bermudahis last work being a chapter of
amusing Advicefor me as he confessedwhat I was to do upon reaching
the gate of which St Peter is said to keep the key As it is the last
writing he ever did and because it is characteristic one or two
paragraphs may be admitted here

 Upon arrival do not speak to St Peter until spoken to It is not
 your place to begin

 Do not begin any remark with Say

 When applying for a ticket avoid trying to make conversation If
 you must talk let the weather alone  

 You can ask him for his autographthere is no harm in thatbut be
 careful and dont remark that it is one of the penalties of
 greatness He has heard that before

There were several pages of this counsel




LXIX

THE RETURN TO REDDING

I spent most of each day with him merely sitting by the bed and reading
I noticed when he slept that his breathing was difficult and I could see
that he did not improve but often he was gay and liked the entire family
to gather about and be merry It was only a few days before we sailed
that the severe attacks returned Then followed bad nights but respite
came and we sailed on the 12th as arranged The Allen home stands on
the water and Mr Allen had chartered a tug to take us to the ship We
were obliged to start early and the fresh morning breeze was
stimulating Mark Twain seemed in good spirits when we reached the
Oceana which was to take him home

As long as I remember anything I shall remember the fortyeight hours of
that homeward voyage He was comfortable at first and then we ran into
the humid oppressive air of the Gulf Stream and he could not breathe
It seemed to me that the end might come at any moment and this thought
was in his own mind but he had no dread and his sense of humor did not
fail Once when the ship rolled and his hat fell from the hook and made
the circuit of the cabin floor he said

 The ship is passing the hat

I had been instructed in the use of the hypodermic needle and from time
to time gave him the hypnotic injunction as he still called it But
it did not afford him entire relief He could remain in no position for
any length of time Yet he never complained and thought only of the
trouble he might be making Once he said

 I am sorry for you Paine but I cant help itI cant hurry this
 dying business

And a little later

 Oh it is such a mystery and it takes so long

Relatives physicians and newsgatherers were at the dock to welcome
him Revived by the cool fresh air of the North he had slept for
several hours and was seemingly much better A special compartment on
the same train that had taken us first to Redding took us there now his
physicians in attendance He did not seem to mind the trip or the drive
home

As we turned into the lane that led to Stormfield he said

Can we see where you have built your billiardroom

The gable of the new study showed among the trees and I pointed it out
to him

It looks quite imposing he said

Arriving at Stormfield he stepped unassisted from the carriage to
greet the members of the household and with all his old courtliness
offered each his hand Then in a canvas chair we had brought we carried
him upstairs to his roomthe big beautiful room that looked out to the
sunset hills This was Thursday evening April 14 1910

THE CLOSE OF A GREAT LIFE

Mark Twain lived just a week from that day and hour For a time he
seemed full of life talking freely and suffering little Clara and
Ossip Gabrilowitsch arrived on Saturday and found him cheerful quite
like himself At intervals he read Suetonius and Carlyle lay on
the bed beside him and he would pick them up and read a page or a
paragraph Sometimes when I saw him thusthe high color still in his
face the clear light in his eyesI said It is not reality He is
not going to die

But by Wednesday of the following week it was evident that the end was
near We did not know it then but the mysterious messenger of his birth
year Halleys comet became visible that night in the sky13

On Thursday morning the 21st his mind was still fairly clear and he
read a little from one of the volumes on his bed By Clara he sent word
that he wished to see me and when I came in he spoke of two unfinished
manuscripts which he wished me to throw away as he briefly expressed
it for his words were few now and uncertain I assured him that I
would attend to the matter and he pressed my hand It was his last word
to me During the afternoon while Clara stood by him he sank into a
doze and from it passed into a deeper slumber and did not heed us any
more

Through that peaceful spring afternoon the lifewave ebbed lower and
lower It was about halfpast six and the sun lay just on the horizon
when Dr Quintard noticed that the breathing which had gradually become
more subdued broke a little There was no suggestion of any struggle
The noble head turned a little to one side there was a fluttering sigh
and the breath that had been unceasing for seventyfour tumultuous years
had stopped forever

In the Brick Church New York Mark Twaindressed in the white he loved
so welllay with the nobility of death upon him while a multitude of
those who loved him passed by and looked at his face for the last time
Flowers in profusion were banked about him but on the casket lay a
single wreath which Dan Beard and his wife had woven from the laurel
which grows on Stormfield hill He was never more beautiful than as he
lay there and it was an impressive scene to see those thousands file by
regard him for a moment gravely thoughtfully and pass on All sorts
were there rich and poor some crossed themselves some saluted some
paused a little to take a closer look

That night we went with him to Elmira and next day he lay in those
stately parlors that had seen his weddingday and where little Langdon
and Susy had lain and Mrs Clemens and then Jean only a little while
before

The wornout body had reached its journeys end but his spirit had never
grown old and today still young it continues to cheer and comfort a
tired world
