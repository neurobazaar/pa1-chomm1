ON THE ADVISABLENESS OF IMPROVING NATURAL KNOWLEDGE


By Thomas H Huxley

1



This time two hundred years agoin the beginning of January
1666those of our forefathers who inhabited this great and ancient
city took breath between the shocks of two fearful calamities one not
quite past although its fury had abated the other to come

Within a few yards of the very spot on which we are assembled so the
tradition runs that painful and deadly malady the plague appeared in
the latter months of 1664 and though no new visitor smote the people
of England and especially of her capital with a violence unknown
before in the course of the following year The hand of a master has
pictured what happened in those dismal months and in that truest of
fictions The History of the Plague Year Defoe shows death with
every accompaniment of pain and terror stalking through the narrow
streets of old London and changing their busy hum into a silence broken
only by the wailing of the mourners of fifty thousand dead by the woful
denunciations and mad prayers of fanatics and by the madder yells of
despairing profligates

But about this time in 1666 the deathrate had sunk to nearly its
ordinary amount a case of plague occurred only here and there and
the richer citizens who had flown from the pest had returned to their
dwellings The remnant of the people began to toil at the accustomed
round of duty or of pleasure and the stream of city life bid fair to
flow back along its old bed with renewed and uninterrupted vigour

The newly kindled hope was deceitful The great plague indeed returned
no more but what it had done for the Londoners the great fire which
broke out in the autumn of 1666 did for London and in September of
that year a heap of ashes and the indestructible energy of the people
were all that remained of the glory of fivesixths of the city within
the walls

Our forefathers had their own ways of accounting for each of these
calamities They submitted to the plague in humility and in penitence
for they believed it to be the judgment of God But towards the fire
they were furiously indignant interpreting it as the effect of the
malice of manas the work of the Republicans or of the Papists
according as their prepossessions ran in favour of loyalty or of
Puritanism

It would I fancy have fared but ill with one who standing where I
now stand in what was then a thickly peopled and fashionable part of
London should have broached to our ancestors the doctrine which I now
propound to youthat all their hypotheses were alike wrong that the
plague was no more in their sense Divine judgment than the fire was
the work of any political or of any religious sect but that they were
themselves the authors of both plague and fire and that they must look
to themselves to prevent the recurrence of calamities to all appearance
so peculiarly beyond the reach of human controlso evidently the result
of the wrath of God or of the craft and subtlety of an enemy

And one may picture to ones self how harmoniously the holy cursing of
the Puritan of that day would have chimed in with the unholy cursing and
the crackling wit of the Rochesters and Sedleys and with the revilings
of the political fanatics if my imaginary plain dealer had gone on
to say that if the return of such misfortunes were ever rendered
impossible it would not be in virtue of the victory of the faith
of Laud or of that of Milton and as little by the triumph of
republicanism as by that of monarchy But that the one thing needful
for compassing this end was that the people of England should second
the effort of an insignificant corporation the establishment of which
a few years before the epoch of the great plague and the great fire had
been as little noticed as they were conspicuous

Some twenty years before the outbreak of the plague a few calm and
thoughtful students banded themselves together for the purpose as they
phrased it of improving natural knowledge The ends they proposed
to attain cannot be stated more clearly than in the words of one of the
founders of the organization

Our business was precluding matters of theology and state affairs to
discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries and such as related
thereuntoas Physick Anatomy Geometry Astronomy Navigation
Staticks Magneticks Chymicks Mechanicks and Natural Experiments
with the state of these studies and their cultivation at home and
abroad We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood the valves
in the veins the venae lacteae the lymphatic vessels the Copernican
hypothesis the nature of comets and new stars the satellites of
Jupiter the oval shape as it then appeared of Saturn the spots
on the sun and its turning on its own axis the inequalities and
selenography of the moon the several phases of Venus and Mercury the
improvement of telescopes and grinding of glasses for that purpose
the weight of air the possibility or impossibility of vacuities and
natures abhorrence thereof the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver
the descent of heavy bodies and the degree of acceleration therein
with divers other things of like nature some of which were then but new
discoveries and others not so generally known and embraced as now they
are with other things appertaining to what hath been called the New
Philosophy which from the times of Galileo at Florence and Sir Francis
Bacon Lord Verulam in England hath been much cultivated in Italy
France Germany and other parts abroad as well as with us in England

The learned Dr Wallis writing in 1696 narrates in these words what
happened half a century before or about 1645 The associates met
at Oxford in the rooms of Dr Wilkins who was destined to become a
bishop and subsequently coming together in London they attracted
the notice of the king And it is a strange evidence of the taste for
knowledge which the most obviously worthless of the Stuarts shared with
his father and grandfather that Charles the Second was not content with
saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with
regard to them For he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he
could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual
state of impecuniosity begged for them of the Duke of Ormond and that
step being without effect gave them Chelsea College a charter and
a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by
burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference

Thus it was that the halfdozen young men studious of the New
Philosophy who met in one anothers lodgings in Oxford or in London
in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in
real strength until in the latter part the Royal Society for the
improvement of Natural Knowledge had already become famous and had
acquired a claim upon the veneration of Englishmen which it has ever
since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our
islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support

It was by the aid of the Royal Society that Newton published his
Principia If all the books in the world except the Philosophical
Transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of
physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual
progress of the last two centuries would be largely though
incompletely recorded Nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude
manifested themselves in our own times As in Dr Walliss days so
in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs
to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries But our
Mathematick is one which Newton would have to go to school to
learn our Staticks Mechanicks Magneticks Chymicks and Natural
Experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a
glimpse at which would compensate Galileo for the doings of a score of
inquisitorial cardinals our Physick and Anatomy have embraced such
infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and
space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems
that the eyes of Vesalius and of Harvey might be dazzled by the sight of
the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed

The fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon ones
notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no
less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect
if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the Royal
Society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind

A series of volumes as bulky as the Transactions of the Royal Society
might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the Schoolmen
not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval
thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of
energy than the acquirement of the New Philosophy but though such
work engrossed the best intellects of Europe for a longer time than has
elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far
as our social state is concerned

On the other hand if the noble first President of the Royal Society
could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight
of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material
civilization more different from that of his day than that of the
seventeenth was from that of the first century And if Lord Brounckers
native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long
reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these
telegraphs these factories these printingpresses without which the
whole fabric of modern English society would collapse into a mass of
stagnant and starving pauperismthat all these pillars of our State
are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great
spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were
privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved
them above all things to keep pure and undefiled

It may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble
revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and
anxious to know how often London had been burned down since his time
and how often the plague had carried off its thousands He would have to
learn that although London contains tenfold the inflammable matter that
it did in 1666 though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork
and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases
into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a
street to burn down And if he asked how this had come about we should
have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished
us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of
which would have furnished the ingenious Mr Hooke the first curator
and experimenter of the Royal Society with ample materials for
discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say
truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not
have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are
constructed And further it would be necessary to add that although
severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very
generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been
rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the
direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of
other natural knowledge

But the plague My Lord Brounckers observation would not I fear lead
him to think that Englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in
life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which
could produce a Boyle an Evelyn and a Milton He might find the mud
of society at the bottom instead of at the top but I fear that the
sum total would be a deserving of swift judgment as at the time of the
Restoration And it would be our duty to explain once more and this
time not without shame that we have no reason to believe that it is the
improvement of our faith nor that of our morals which keeps the plague
from our city but again that it is the improvement of our natural
knowledge

We have learned that pestilences will only take up their abode among
those who have prepared unswept and ungarnished residences for them
Their cities must have narrow unwatered streets foul with accumulated
garbage Their houses must be illdrained illlighted illventilated
Their subjects must be illwashed illfed illclothed The London
of 1665 was such a city The cities of the East where plague has an
enduring dwelling are such cities We in later times have learned
somewhat of Nature and partly obey her Because of this partial
improvement of our natural knowledge and of that fractional obedience
we have no plague because that knowledge is still very imperfect and
that obedience yet incomplete typhus is our companion and cholera our
visitor But it is not presumptuous to express the belief that when
our knowledge is more complete and our obedience the expression of our
knowledge London will count her centuries of freedom from typhus
and cholera as she now gratefully reckons her two hundred years of
ignorance of that plague which swooped upon her thrice in the first half
of the seventeenth century

Surely there is nothing in these explanations which is not fully borne
out by the facts Surely the principles involved in them are now
admitted among the fixed beliefs of all thinking men Surely it is true
that our countrymen are less subject to fire famine pestilence
and all the evils which result from a want of command over and due
anticipation of the course of Nature than were the countrymen of
Milton and health wealth and wellbeing are more abundant with us
than with them But no less certainly is the difference due to the
improvement of our knowledge of Nature and the extent to which that
improved knowledge has been incorporated with the household words of
men and has supplied the springs of their daily actions

Granting for a moment then the truth of that which the depreciators of
natural knowledge are so fond of urging that its improvement can only
add to the resources of our material civilization admitting it to be
possible that the founders of the Royal Society themselves looked for
no other reward than this I cannot confess that I was guilty
of exaggeration when I hinted that to him who had the gift of
distinguishing between prominent events and important events the origin
of a combined effort on the part of mankind to improve natural knowledge
might have loomed larger than the Plague and have outshone the glare
of the Fire as a something fraught with a wealth of beneficence to
mankind in comparison with which the damage done by those ghastly evils
would shrink into insignificance

It is very certain that for every victim slain by the plague hundreds
of mankind exist and find a fair share of happiness in the world by the
aid of the spinning jenny And the great fire at its worst could
not have burned the supply of coal the daily working of which in the
bowels of the earth made possible by the steam pump gives rise to an
amount of wealth to which the millions lost in old London are but as an
old song

But spinning jenny and steam pump are after all but toys possessing
an accidental value and natural knowledge creates multitudes of more
subtle contrivances the praises of which do not happen to be sung
because they are not directly convertible into instruments of creating
wealth When I contemplate natural knowledge squandering such gifts
among men the only appropriate comparison I can find for her is to
liken her to such a peasant woman as one sees in the Alps striding ever
upward heavily burdened and with mind bent only on her home but
yet without effort and without thought knitting for her children
Now stockings are good and comfortable things and the children
will undoubtedly be much the better for them but surely it would be
shortsighted to say the least of it to depreciate this toiling mother
as a mere stockingmachinea mere provider of physical comforts

However there are blind leaders of the blind and not a few of them
who take this view of natural knowledge and can see nothing in the
bountiful mother of humanity but a sort of comfortgrinding machine
According to them the improvement of natural knowledge always has been
and always must be synonymous with no more than the improvement of the
material resources and the increase of the gratification of men

Natural knowledge is in their eyes no real mother of mankind bringing
them up with kindness and if need be with sternness in the way they
should go and instructing them in all things needful for their welfare
but a sort of fairy godmother ready to furnish her pets with shoes of
swiftness swords of sharpness and omnipotent Aladdins lamps so that
they may have telegraphs to Saturn and see the other side of the moon
and thank God they are better than their benighted ancestors If this
talk were true I for one should not greatly care to toil in the
service of natural knowledge I think I would just as soon be quietly
chipping my own flint axe after the manner of my forefathers a few
thousand years back as be troubled with the endless malady of thought
which now infests us all for such reward But I venture to say that
such views are contrary alike to reason and to fact Those who discourse
in such fashion seem to me to be so intent upon trying to see what is
above Nature or what is behind her that they are blind to what stares
them in the face in her

I should not venture to speak thus strongly if my justification were not
to be found in the simplest and most obvious factsif it needed more
than an appeal to the most notorious truths to justify my assertion
that the improvement of natural knowledge whatever direction it has
taken and however low the aims of those who may have commenced ithas
not only conferred practical benefits on men but in so doing has
effected a revolution in their conceptions of the universe and of
themselves and has profoundly altered their modes of thinking and
their views of right and wrong I say that natural knowledge seeking
to satisfy natural wants has found the ideas which can alone still
spiritual cravings I way that natural knowledge in desiring to
ascertain the laws of comfort has been driven to discover those of
conduct and to lay the foundations of a new morality

Let us take these points separately and first what great ideas has
natural knowledge introduced into mens minds

I cannot but think that the foundations of all natural knowledge were
laid when the reason of man first came face to face with the facts of
Nature when the savage first learned that the fingers of one hand are
fewer than those of both that it is shorter to cross a stream than to
head it that a stone stops where it is unless it be moved and that it
drops from the hand which lets it go that light and heat come and go
with the sun that sticks burn away to a fire that plants and animals
grow and die that if he struck his fellowsavage a blow he would make
him angry and perhaps get a blow in return while if he offered him a
fruit he would please him and perhaps receive a fish in exchange When
men had acquired this much knowledge the outlines rude though they
were of mathematics of physics of chemistry of biology of moral
economical and political science were sketched Nor did the germ of
religion fail when science began to bud Listen to words which though
new are yet three thousand years old

 When in heaven the stars about the moon
 Look beautiful when all the winds are laid
 And every height comes out and jutting peak
 And valley and the immeasurable heavens
 Break open to their highest and all the start
 Shine and the shepherd gladdens in his heart 2

If the halfsavage Greek could share our feelings thus far it is
irrational to doubt that he went further to find as we do that upon
that brief gladness there follows a certain sorrowthe little light of
awakened human intelligence shines so mere a spark amidst the abyss
of the unknown and unknowable seems so insufficient to do more than
illuminate the imperfections that cannot be remedied the aspirations
that cannot be realized of mans own nature But in this sadness this
consciousness of the limitation of man this sense of an open secret
which he cannot penetrate lies the essence of all religion and the
attempt to embody it in the forms furnished by the intellect is the
origin of the higher theologies

Thus it seems impossible to imagine but that the foundations of all
knowledgesecular or sacredwere laid when intelligence dawned though
the superstructure remained for long ages so slight and feeble as to be
compatible with the existence of almost any general view respecting the
mode of governance of the universe No doubt from the first there were
certain phenomena which to the rudest mind presented a constancy of
occurrence and suggested that a fixed order ruled at any rate among
them I doubt if the grossest of Fetish worshippers ever imagined that
a stone must have a god within it to make it fall or that a fruit had
a god within it to make it taste sweet With regard to such matters
as these it is hardly questionable that mankind from the first took
strictly positive and scientific views

But with respect to all the less familiar occurrences which present
themselves uncultured man no doubt has always taken himself as the
standard of comparison as the centre and measure of the world nor
could he well avoid doing so And finding that his apparently uncaused
will has a powerful effect in giving rise to many occurrences he
naturally enough ascribed other and greater events to other and greater
volitions and came to look upon the world and all that therein is as
the product of the volitions of persons like himself but stronger and
capable of being appeased or angered as he himself might be soothed
or irritated Through such conceptions of the plan and working of
the universe all mankind have passed or are passing And we may
now consider what has been the effect of the improvement of natural
knowledge on the views of men who have reached this stage and who
have begun to cultivate natural knowledge with no desire but that of
increasing Gods honour and bettering mans estate

For example what could seem wiser from a mere material point of view
more innocent from a theological one to an ancient people than that
they should learn the exact succession of the seasons as warnings for
their husbandmen or the position of the stars as guides to their rude
navigators But what has grown out of this search for natural
knowledge of so merely useful a character You all know the reply
Astronomywhich of all sciences has filled mens minds with general
ideas of a character most foreign to their daily experience and has
more than any other rendered it impossible for them to accept the
beliefs of their fathers Astronomywhich tells them that this so vast
and seemingly solid earth is but an atom among atoms whirling no man
knows whither through illimitable space which demonstrates that what
we call the peaceful heaven above us is but that space filled by an
infinitely subtle matter whose particles are seething and surging like
the waves of an angry sea which opens up to us infinite regions where
nothing is known or ever seems to have been known but matter and
force operating according to rigid rules which leads us to contemplate
phenomena the very nature of which demonstrates that they must have
had a beginning and that they must have an end but the very nature of
which also proves that the beginning was to our conceptions of time
infinitely remote and that the end is as immeasurably distant

But it is not alone those who pursue astronomy who ask for bread
and receive ideas What more harmless than the attempt to lift and
distribute water by pumping it what more absolutely and grossly
utilitarian But out of pumps grew the discussions about Natures
abhorrence of a vacuum and then it was discovered that Nature does not
abhor a vacuum but that air has weight and that notion paved the way
for the doctrine that all matter has weight and that the force which
produces weight is coextensive with the universein short to the
theory of universal gravitation and endless force While learning how
to handle gases led to the discovery of oxygen and to modern chemistry
and to the notion of the indestructibility of matter

Again what simpler or more absolutely practical than the attempt to
keep the axle of a wheel from heating when the wheel turns round very
fast How useful for carters and gig drivers to know something about
this and how good were it if any ingenious person would find out the
cause of such phenomena and thence educe a general remedy for them
Such an ingenious person was Count Rumford and he and his successors
have landed us in the theory of the persistence or indestructibility
of force And in the infinitely minute as in the infinitely great
the seekers after natural knowledge of the kinds called physical and
chemical have everywhere found a definite order and succession of
events which seem never to be infringed

And how has it fared with Physick and Anatomy Have the anatomist
the physiologist or the physician whose business it has been to devote
themselves assiduously to that eminently practical and direct end
the alleviation of the sufferings of mankindhave they been able to
confine their vision more absolutely to the strictly useful I fear they
are worst offenders of all For if the astronomer has set before us the
infinite magnitude of space and the practical eternity of the duration
of the universe if the physical and chemical philosophers have
demonstrated the infinite minuteness of its constituent parts and
the practical eternity of matter and of force and if both have alike
proclaimed the universality of a definite and predicable order and
succession of events the workers in biology have not only accepted all
these but have added more startling theses of their own For as the
astronomers discover in the earth no centre of the universe but an
eccentric speck so the naturalists find man to be no centre of the
living world but one amidst endless modifications of life and as the
astronomer observes the mark of practically endless time set upon
the arrangements of the solar system so the student of life finds the
records of ancient forms of existence peopling the world for ages
which in relation to human experience are infinite

Furthermore the physiologist finds life to be as dependent for its
manifestation on particular molecular arrangements as any physical or
chemical phenomenon and whenever he extends his researches fixed
order and unchanging causation reveal themselves as plainly as in the
rest of Nature

Nor can I find that any other fate has awaited the germ of Religion
Arising like all other kinds of knowledge and out of the action and
interaction of mans mind with that which is not mans mind it has
taken the intellectual coverings of Fetishism or Polytheism of Theism
or Atheism of Superstition or Rationalism With these and their
relative merits and demerits I have nothing to do but this it is
needful for my purpose to say that if the religion of the present
differs from that of the past it is because the theology of the present
has become more scientific than that of the past because it has not
only renounced idols of wood and idols of stone but begins to see
the necessity of breaking in pieces the idols built up of books and
traditions and finespun ecclesiastical cobwebs and of cherishing the
noblest and most human of mans emotions by worship for the most part
of the silent sort at the altar of the Unknown and Unknowable

Such are a few of the new conceptions implanted in our minds by the
improvement of natural knowledge Men have acquired the ideas of
the practically infinite extent of the universe and of its practical
eternity they are familiar with the conception that our earth is but an
infinitesimal fragment of that part of the universe which can be seen
and that nevertheless its duration is as compared with our standards
of time infinite They have further acquired the idea that man is but
one of innumerable forms of life now existing in the globe and that
the present existences are but the last of an immeasurable series of
predecessors Moreover every step they have made in natural knowledge
has tended to extend and rivet in their minds the conception of a
definite order of the universewhich is embodied in what are called
by an unhappy metaphor the laws of Natureand to narrow the range and
loosen the force of mens belief in spontaneity or in changes other
than such as arise out of that definite order itself Whether these
ideas are well or ill founded is not the question No one can deny that
they exist and have been the inevitable outgrowth of the improvement
of natural knowledge And if so it cannot be doubted that they
are changing the form of mens most cherished and most important
convictions

And as regards the second pointthe extent to which the improvement
of natural knowledge has remodelled and altered what may be termed the
intellectual ethics of menwhat are among the moral convictions most
fondly held by barbarous and semibarbarous people

They are the convictions that authority is the soundest basis of
belief that merit attaches to a readiness to believe that the doubting
disposition is a bad one and scepticism a sin that when good authority
has pronounced what is to be believed and faith has accepted it reason
has no further duty There are many excellent persons who yet hold by
these principles and it is not my present business or intention to
discuss their views All I wish to bring clearly before your minds is
the unquestionable fact that the improvement of natural knowledge
is effected by methods which directly give the lie to all these
convictions and assume the exact reverse of each to be true

The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge
authority as such For him scepticism is the highest of duties blind
faith the one unpardonable sin And it cannot be otherwise for every
great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection
of authority the cherishing of the keenest scepticism the annihilation
of the spirit of blind faith and the most ardent votary of science
holds his firmest convictions not because the men he most venerates
hold them not because their verity is testified by portents and
wonders but because his experience teaches him that whenever he chooses
to bring these convictions into contact with their primary source
Naturewhenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment
and to observationNature will confirm them The man of science has
learned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification

Thus without for a moment pretending to despise the practical results
of the improvement of natural knowledge and its beneficial influence
on material civilization it must I think be admitted that the great
ideas some of which I have indicated and the ethical spirit which
I have endeavoured to sketch in the few moments which remained at my
disposal constitute the real and permanent significance of natural
knowledge

If these ideas be destined as I believe they are to be more and more
firmly established as the world grows older if that spirit be fated as
I believe it is to extend itself into all departments of human thought
and to become coextensive with the range of knowledge if as our race
approaches its maturity it discovers as I believe it will that there
is but one kind of knowledge and but one method of acquiring it then
we who are still children may justly feel it our highest duty to
recognise the advisableness of improving natural knowledge and so to
aid ourselves and our successors in their course towards the noble goal
which lies before mankind
