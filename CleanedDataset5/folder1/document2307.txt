CHAPTER I

AT THE DEPOT


Mr Simeon Phinney emerged from the side door of his residence and
paused a moment to light his pipe in the lee of the lilac bushes Mr
Phinney was a man of various and sundry occupations and his sign
nailed to the big silverleaf in the front yard enumerated a few of
them Carpenter Well Driver Building Mover Cranberry Bogs Seen to
with Care and Dispatch etc etc so read the sign The house was
situated in Phinneys Lane the crooked little byway off Cross
Street between the Shore Road at the foot of the slope and the Hill
Boulevardformerly Higginss Roostat the top From the Phinney
gate the view was extensive and for the most part wet The hill
descended sharply past the Shore Road over the barren fields and
knolls covered with bayberry bushes and poverty grass to the yellow
sand of the beach and the gray weatherbeaten fishhouses scattered
along it Beyond was the bay a glimmer in the sunset light

Mrs Phinney in the kitchen was busy with the supper dishes Her
husband wheezing comfortably at his musical pipe drew an ancient
silver watch from his pocket and looked at its dial Quarter past six
Time to be getting down to the depot and the post office At least a
dozen male citizens of East Harniss were thinking that very thing at
that very moment It was a community habit of long standing to see the
train come in and go after the mail The facts that the train bore no
passengers in whom you were intimately interested and that you expected
no mail made little difference If you were a man of thirty or older
you went to the depot or the club just as your wife or sisters went
to the sewing circle for sociability and mild excitement If you were
a single young man you went to the post office for the same reason that
you attended prayer meeting If you were a single young lady you went
to the post office and prayer meeting to furnish a reason for the young
man

Mr Phinney replacing his watch in his pocket meandered to the
sidewalk and looked down the hill and along the length of the Shore
Road Beside the latter highway stood a little house painted a
spotless white its window blinds a vivid green In that house dwelt
and dwelt alone Captain Solomon Berry Sim Phinneys particular
friend Captain Sol was the East Harniss depot master and from long
acquaintance Mr Phinney knew that he should be through supper and
ready to return to the depot by this time The pair usually walked
thither together when the evening meal was over

But except for the smoke curling lazily from the kitchen chimney
there was no sign of life about the Berry house Either Captain Sol had
already gone or he was not yet ready to go So Mr Phinney decided that
waiting was chancey and set out alone

He climbed Cross Street to where the Hill Boulevard abiding place of
East Harnisss summer aristocracy bisected it and there standing on
the corner and consciously patronizing the spot where he so stood was
Mr Ogden Hapworth Williams no less

Mr Williams was the village millionaire patron and in a gentlemanly
way boomer His estate on the Boulevard was the finest in the county
and he more than any one else was responsible for the buying up
by wealthy people from the city of the towns best building sites the
spots commanding fine marine sea views to quote from Abner Payne
local real estate and insurance agent His own estate was fine enough to
be talked about from one end of the Cape to the other and he had bought
the empty lot opposite and made it into a miniature park with flower
beds and gravel walks though no one but he or his might pick the
flowers or tread the walks He had brought on a wealthy friend from New
York and a cousin from Chicago and they too had bought acres on the
Boulevard and erected palatial cottages where once were the houses of
country people Local cynics suggested that the sign on the East Harniss
railroad station should be changed to read Williamsburg He owns the
place body and soul said they

As Sim Phinney climbed the hill the magnate pompous portly and
imposing held up a signaling finger Just as if he was hailin a horse
car described Simeon afterward

Phinney he said come here I want to speak to you

The man of many trades obediently approached

Good evenin Mr Williams he ventured

Phinney went on the great man briskly I want you to give me your
figures on a house moving deal I have bought a house on the Shore Road
the one that used to belong to theerSmalleys I believe

Simeon was surprised What the old Smalley house he exclaimed You
dont tell me

Yes its a fine specimenso my wife saysof the pure Colonial
whatever that is and I intend moving it to the Boulevard I want your
figures for the job

The building mover looked puzzled To the Boulevard he said Why I
didnt know there was a vacant lot on the Boulevard Mr Williams

There isnt now but there will be soon I have got hold of the hundred
feet left from the old Seabury estate

Mr Phinney drew a long breath Why he stammered thats where Olive
Edwardsher that was Olive Seaburylives aint it

Yes was the rather impatient answer She has been living there But
the place was mortgaged up to the handle andahemthe mortgage is mine
now

For an instant Simeon did not reply He was gazing not up the Boulevard
in the direction of the Seabury place but across the slope of the
hill toward the home of Captain Sol Berry the depot master There was a
troubled look on his face

Well inquired Williams briskly when can you give me the figures
They must be low mind No country skin games you understand

Hey Phinney came out of his momentary trance Yes yes Mr
Williams Theyll be low enough Times is kind of dull now and Id
like a movin job firstrate Ill give em to you tomorrer Butbut
Olivell have to move wont she And wheres she goin

Shell have to move sure And the eyesore on that lot now will come
down

The eyesore was the four room building combined dwelling and shop of
Mrs Olive Edwards widow of Bill Edwards once a promising young man
later town drunkard and neerdowell dead these five years luckily
for himself and luckierin a wayfor the wife who had stuck by him
while he wasted her inheritance in a losing battle with John Barleycorn
At his death the fine old Seabury place had dwindled to a lone hundred
feet of land the little house and a mortgage on both Olive had opened
a notion store in her front parlor and had fought on proudly refusing
aid and trying to earn a living She had failed Again Phinney stared
thoughtfully at the distant house of Captain Sol

But Olive he said slowly She aint got no folks has she Whatll
become of her Wherell she move to

That said Mr Williams with a wave of a fat hand is not my
business I am sorry for her if shes hard up But I cant be
responsible if men will drink up their wives money Look out for number
one thats business I shant be unreasonable with her She can stay
where she is until the new house Ive bought is moved to that lot Then
she must clear out Ive told her that She knows all about it Well
goodby Phinney I shall expect your bid tomorrow And mind dont
try to get the best of me because you cant do it

He turned and strutted back up the Boulevard Sim Phinney pondering
deeply and very grave continued on his way down Cross Street
to Mainnaming the village roads was another of the Williams
improvementsand along that to the crossing East Harnisss business
and social center at train times

The stationeveryone called it deepo of coursewas then a small red
building old and out of date but scrupulously neat because of Captain
Berrys rigid surveillance Close beside it was the Boston Grocery
Dry Goods and General Store Mr Beriah Higgins proprietor Beriah
was postmaster and the post office was in his store The male citizen
of middle age or over seeking opportunity for companionship and chat
usually went first to the depot sat about in the waiting room until the
train came in superintended that function then sojourned to the post
office until the mail was sorted returning later if he happened to be
a particular friend of the depot master to sit and smoke and yarn until
Captain Sol announced that it was time to turn in

When Mr Phinney entered the little waiting room he found it already
tenanted Captain Sol had not yet arrived but official authority was
represented by Issy McKayhis full name was Issachar Ulysses Grant
McKaya longlegged freckledfaced towheaded youth of twenty who
as usual was sprawled along the settee by the wall engrossed in
a paper covered dime novel Issy was a lover of certain kinds of
literature and reveled in lurid fiction As a youngster he had at
the age of thirteen after a course of reading in the Deadwood Dick
Library started on a pedestrian journey to the Far West where
being armed with homemade tomahawk and scalping knife he contemplated
extermination of the noble red man A wrathful pursuing parent had
collared the exterminator at the Bayport station to the huge delight of
East Harniss young and old Since this adventure Issy had been famous
in a way

He was Captain Sol Berrys assistant at the depot Why an assistant
was needed was a much discussed question Why Captain Sol a retired
seafaring man with money in the bank should care to be depot master
at ten dollars a week was another The Captain himself said he took the
place because he wanted to do something that was half way between a
loaf and a job He employed an assistant at his own expense because
he might want to stretch the loafin half And he hired Issy
becausewell because most folks in East Harniss are alike and you can
always tell about what theyll say or do Now Issys different The Lord
only knows what HES likely to do and that makes him interestin as a
conundrum to guess at He kind of keeps my sense of responsibility from
gettin mossy Issy does

Issy hailed Mr Phinney has the Capn got here yet

Issy answered not The villainous floorwalker had just proffered
matrimony or summary discharge to Flora the Beautiful Shop Girl and
pending her answer the McKay mind had no room for trifles

Issy shouted Simeon I say Is Wake up you foolhead Has Capn
Sol

No he aint Sim volunteered Ed Crocker He and his chum Cornelius
Rowe were seated in two of the waiting room chairs their feet on two
others He aint got here yet We was just talkin about him Youve
heard about Olive Edwards I spose likely aint you

Phinney nodded gloomily

Yes he said Ive heard

Well its too bad continued Crocker But after all its Olives
own fault Shed ought to have married Sol Berry when she had the
chance What she ever gave him the goby for after the years they was
keepin compny is moren I can understand

Cornelius Rowe shook his head with an air of wisdom Captain Sol
himself remarked once I wonder sometimes the Almighty aint jealous
of Cornelius he knows so much and is so responsible for the runnin of
all creation

Humph grunted Mr Rowe Theres more to that business than you folks
think Olive didnt notice Bill Edwards till Sol went off to sea and
stayed two years and over How do you know she shook Sol You might just
as well say he shook her He always was stubborn as an off ox and cranky
as a windlass I wonder how he feels now when shes lost her last red
and is goin to be drove out of house and home And all on account of
that fool mountain and Mahomet business

WHICH asked Mr Crocker

Never mind that Cornelius put in Phinney sharply Why dont you
let other folks affairs alone That was a secret that Olive told your
sister and youve got no right to go blabbin

Aw hush up Sim I aint tellin no secrets to anybody but Ed here
and he aint lived in East Harniss long or hed know it already The
mountain and Mahomet Why them was the last words Sol and Olive had
Twas Sols stubbornness that was most to blame That was his one bad
fault He would have his own way and he wouldnt change Olive had set
her heart on goin to Washinton for their weddin tower Sol wanted
to go to Niagara They argued a long time and finally Olive says No
Solomon Im not goin to give in this time I have all the others but
its not fair and its not right and no married life can be happy where
one does all the sacrificin If you care for me youll do as I want
now

And he laughs and says All right Ill sacrifice after this but you
and me must see Niagara And she was sot and he was sotter and at last
they quarreled He marches out of the door and says Very good When
youre ready to be sensible and change your mind you can come to me
And says Olive pretty white but firm No Solomon Im right and
youre not Im afraid this time the mountain must come to Mahomet
That ended it He went away and never come back and after a long spell
she give in to her dad and married Bill Edwards Foolish Well now
WANT it

Humph grunted Crocker She must have been a born gump to let a smart
man like him get away just for that

Theres a good many born gumps not so far from here as her house
interjected Phinney You remember that next time you look in the glass
Ed Crocker Andandwell theres no better friend of Sol Berrys on
earth than I am but so fur as their quarrel was concerned if you ask
me Id have to say Olive was pretty nigh right

Maybemaybe declared the allwise Cornelius but just the same if I
was Sol Berry and knew my old girl was likely to go to the poorhouse
Ill bet my conscience

Sssh hissed Crocker frantically Cornelius stopped in the middle
of his sentence whirled in his chair and looked up Behind him in the
doorway of the station stood Captain Sol himself The blue cap he always
wore was set back on his head a cigar tipped upward from the corner
of his mouth and there was a grim look in his eye and about the smooth
shaven lips above the short grayishbrown beard

Issy sprang from his settee and jammed the paper novel into his
pocket Ed Crockers sunburned face turned redder yet Sim Phinney
grinned at Mr Rowe who was very much embarrassed

Ererevenin Capn Sol he stammered Nice seasonable weather
aint it Been a nice day

Um grunted the depot master knocking the ashes from his cigar

Just right for workin outdoor continued Cornelius

I guess it must be I saw your wife rakin the yard this mornin

Phinney doubled up with a chuckle Mr Rowe swallowed hard II TOLD
her Id rake it myself soons I got time he sputtered

Um Well I spose she realized your time was precious Evenin Sim
glad to see you

He held out his hand and Phinney grasped it

Issy said Captain Sol youd better get busy with the broom hadnt
you Its standin over in that corner and I wouldnt wonder if it
needed exercise Sim the train aint due for twenty minutes yet That
gives us at least three quarters of an hour afore it gets here Come
outside a spell I want to talk to you

He led the way to the platform around the corner of the station and
seated himself on the baggage truck That side of the building being
furthest from the street was out of view from the post office and
general store

What was it you wanted to talk about Sol asked Simeon sitting down
beside his friend on the truck

The Captain smoked in silence for a moment Then he asked a question in
return

Sim he said have you heard anything about Williams buying the
Smalley house Is it true

Phinney nodded Yup he answered its true Williams was just
talkin to me and I know all about his buyin it and where its goin

He repeated the conversation with the great man Captain Sol did
not interrupt He smoked on and a frown gathered and deepened as he
listened

Humph he said when his friend had concluded Humph Sim do you
have any idea whatwhat Olive Seabury will do when she has to go

Phinney glanced at him It was the first time in twenty years that he
had heard Solomon Berry mention the name of his former sweetheart And
even now he did not call her by her married name the name of her late
husband

No replied Simeon No Sol I aint got the least idea Poor thing

Another interval Then Well Sim find out if you can and let me
know And turning his head and speaking quietly but firmly dont let
anybody ELSE know I asked

Course I wont Sol you know that But dont it seem awful mean
turnin her out so I wouldnt think Mr Williams would do such a
thing

His companion smiled grimly I would he said Business is
business thats his motto That and Look out for number one

Yes he said somethin to me about lookin out for number one

Did he Humph The Captains smile lost a little of its bitterness
and broadened He seemed to be thinking and to find amusement in the
process

What you grinnin at demanded Phinney

Oh I was just rememberin how he looked out for number one the
firstno the second time I met him I dont believe hes forgot it
Maybe thats why he aint quite so high and mighty to me as he is to the
rest of you fellers Ha ha He tried to patronize me when I first came
back here and took this depot and I just smiled and asked him what the
market price of johnnycake was these days He got red clear up to the
brim of his tall hat Humph TWAS funny

The market price of JOHNNYCAKE He must have thought you was loony

No Im the last man hed think was loony You see I met him a fore he
came here to live at all

You did Where

Oh over to Wellmouth Twas the year afore I come back to East
Harniss myself after my long stretch away from it I never intended to
see the Cape again but I couldnt stay away somehow Ive told you
that muchhow I went over to Wellmouth and boarded a spell got sick
of that and just to be doin somethin and not for the money bought
a catboat and took out sailin parties from Wixon and Wingates summer
hotel

And you met Mr Williams Well I snum Was he at the hotel

No not exactly I met him sort of casual this second time

SECOND time Had you met him afore that

Dont get ahead of the yarn Sim It happened this way You see I was
comin along the road between East Wellmouth and the Center when I run
afoul of him He was fat and shiny and drivin a skittish horse hitched
to a fancy buggy When he sighted me he hove to and hailed

Here you says he in a voice as fat as the rest of him Your names
Berry aint it

Yup says I

Methusalum Berry or Jehoshaphat Berry or Sheba Berry or somethin
like that Hey he says

Well says I the last shot you fired comes nighest the bulls eye
They christened me Solomon but twant my fault I was young at the
time and they took advantage

He grinned a kind of lopsided grin like he had a lemon in his mouth
and commenced to cuss the horse for tryin to climb a pine tree

I knew twas some Bible outrage or other he says Theres more
Bible names in this forsaken sand heap than there is Christians a good
sight When I meet a man with a Bible name and chin whiskers I hang on
to my watch The feller that sets out to do me has got to have a better
make up than that you bet your life Well see here King Sol can you
run a gasoline launch

Why yes I guess I can run most any of the everyday kinds says
I pullin thoughtful at my own chin whiskers This fat man had got me
interested He was so polite and folksy in his remarks Didnt seem to
stand on no ceremony as you might say Likewise there was a kind of
familiar somethin about his face I knew mighty well Id never met him
afore and yet I seemed to have a floatin memory of him same as a chap
remembers the taste of the senna and salts his ma made him take when he
was little

All right says he sharp Then you come around to my landin
tomorrer mornin at eight oclock prompt and take me out in my launch
to the codfishin grounds Ill give you ten dollars to take me out
there and back

Well says I ten dollars is a good price enough Do I furnish

You furnish nothin except your grub he interrupts The launchll
be ready and the lines and hooks and baitll be ready My own man was to
do the job but he and I had a hearttoheart talk just now and I told
him where he could go and go quick No smart Alec gets the best of me
even if he has got a months contract You run that launch and put me on
the fishin grounds I pay you for that and bringin me back again And
I furnish my own extras and you can furnish yours I dont want any of
your Yankee bargainin See

I saw There want no real reason why I couldnt take the job Twas
well along into September the hotel was closed for the season and
about all I had on my hands just then was time

All right says I its a deal If youll guarantee to have your
launch ready I

Thats my business he says Itll be ready If it aint youll get
your pay just the same Tomorrer mornin at eight oclock And dont
you forget and be late Giddap you blackguard says he to the horse

Hold on just a minute I hollers runnin after him I dont want
to be curious nor nosey you understand but seems s if it might help
me to be on time if I knew where your launch was goin to be and what
your name was

He pulled up then Humph he says if you dont know my name and
more about my private affairs than I do myself youre the only one in
this county that dont My names Williams and I live in what you folks
call the Lathrop place over here toward Trumet The launch is at my
landin down in front of the house

He drove off then and I walked along thinkin I knew who he was
now of course There was considerble talk when the Lathrop place was
rented and I gathered that the feller who hired it answered to the hail
of Williams and was a retired banker sufferin from an enlarged income
and the diseases that go along with it He lived alone up there in the
big house except for a cranky housekeeper and two or three servants
This was afore he got married Sim his wifes tamed him a little Then
the yarns about his temper and language would have filled a log book

But all this was way to one side of the markbuoy so fur as I was
concerned Id cruised with cranks afore and I thought I could stand
this oneten dollars worth of him anyhow Bluster and big talk may
scare some folks but to me theyre like Aunt Hepsy Parkers false
teeth the further off you be from em the more real they look So the
next mornin I was up bright and early and on my way over to the Lathrop
landin

The launch was there made fast alongside the little wharf Nice
slicklookin craft she was too all varnish and gilt gorgeousness Id
liked her better if shed carried a sail for its my experience that
canvas is a handy thing to have aboard in case of need but she looked
seaworthy enough and built for speed

While I was standin on the pier lookin down at her I heard footsteps
and brisk remarks from behind the bushes on the bank and here comes
Williams puffin and blowin followed by a sulkylookin hired man
totin a deckload of sweaters and ileskins with a lunch basket on top
Williams himself want carryin anything but his temper but he hadnt
forgot none of that

Hello Berry says he to me You are on time aint you Blessed if
it aint a comfort to find somebody wholl do what I tell em Now you
he says to the servant put them things aboard and clear out as quick
as youve a mind to You and I are through understand Dont let me
find you hangin around the place when I get back Cast off Sol

The man dumped the dunnage into the launch pretty average ugly and me
and the boss climbed aboard I cast off

Mr Williams says the man kind of pleadin aint you goin to pay
me the rest of my months wages

Williams told him he want and added trimmins to make it emphatic

I started the engine and we moved out at a good clip All at once that
hired man runs to the end of the wharf and calls after us

All right for you you fathead he yells Youll be sorry for what
you done to me

I callate the boss would have liked to go back and lick him but I
was hired to go afishin not to watch a onesided prize fight and I
thought twas high time we started

The name of that launch was the Shootin Star and she certainly
lived up to it Twas one of them slick greasy days with no sea worth
mentionin and we biled along fine We had to because the cod ledge is
a good many mile away round Sandy Pint out to sea and judgin by
what Id seen of Fatty so fur I want hankerin to spend more time
with him than was necessary Moren that there was fog signs showin

When was you figgerin on gettin back Mr Williams I asked him

When Ive caught as many fish as I want to he says I told that
housekeeper of mine that Id be back when I got good and ready it might
be tonight and it might be ten days from now If I aint back in a
week you can hunt me up I told her but not before And that goes
Ive got HER trained all right She knows me Its a pity if a man cant
be independent of females

I knew considerble many men that was subjects for pity cordin to
that rule But I want in for no weeks cruise and I told him so He
said of course not wed be home that evenin

The Shootin Star kept slippin along Twas a beautiful mornin and
after a spell it had its effect even on a crippled disposition like
that banker mans He lit up a cigar and begun to get more sociable in
his way Commenced to ask me questions about myself

By and by he says Berry I suppose you figger that its a smart thing
to get ten dollars out of me for a trip like this hey

Not if its to last a week I dont says I

Its your lookout if it does he says prompt You get ten for takin
me out and back If you aint back on time taint my fault

Unless this craft breaks down I says

Twont break down I looked after that My motto is to look out for
number one every time and its a mighty good motto At any rate its
made my money for me

He went on preachin about business shrewdness and how it paid and
how mean and tricky in little deals we Rubes was and yet we didnt
appreciate how to manage big things till I got kind of sick of it

Look here Mr Williams says I you know how I make my moneywhat
little I do makeor you say you do Now if it aint a sassy question
how did you make yours

Well he made his by bein shrewd and careful and always lookin out
for number one Number one was his hobby I gathered that the heft of
his spare change had come from dickers in stocks and bonds

Humph says I Well speakin of tricks and meanness Ive allers
heard tell that there was some of them things hitched to the tail of
the stock market What makes the stock market price ofwell of wheat
well say

That was regulated so he said by the law of supply and demand If a
feller had all the wheat there was and another chap had to have some or
starve why the first one had a right to gouge tother chaps last cent
away from him afore he let it go

Thats legitimate he says Thats cornerin the market Law of
supply and demand exemplified

Cordin to that law says I when you was so set on fishin today
and hunted me up to run your boat herecause I was about the only chap
who could run it and want otherwise busyId ought to have charged
you twenty dollars instead of ten

Sure you had he says grinnin But you werent shrewd enough to
grasp the situation and do it Now the deals closed and its too late

He went on talkin about pools and deals and such How prices of
this stock and that was shoved up apurpose till a lot of folks had
put their money in it and then was smashed flat sos all hands but the
poolers would be what he called squeezed out and the gang would get
their cash That was legitimate toohigh finance he said

But how about the poor folks that had their savins in them stocks
I asks and dont know high financin Wheres the law of supply and
demand come in for them

He laughed They supply the suckers and the demand for money says
he

By eleven we was well out toward the fishin grounds Twas the bad
season now the big fish had struck off still further and there want
another boat in sight The land was just a yeller and green smooch along
the sky line and the waves was runnin bigger The Shootin Star was
seaworthy though and I want worried about her The only thing that
troubled me was the fog and that was pilin up to windard Id called
Fattys attention to it when we fust started but he said he didnt care
a red for fog Well I didnt much care nuther for we had a compass
aboard and the engine was runnin fine What wind there was was blowin
offshore

And then all to once the engine STOPPED runnin I give the wheel a
whirl but she only coughed consumptivelike and quit again I went
forard to inspect and if youll believe it there want a drop of
gasoline left in the tank The spare cans had ought to have been full
and they wasbut twas water they was filled with

Is THIS the way you have your boat ready for me I remarks
sarcastic

Thatthat man of mine told me he had everything filled he stammers
lookin scart

Yes says I and I heard him hint likewise that he was goin to make
you sorry I guess hes done it

Well sir the brimstone names that Fatty called that man was somethin
surprisin to hear When hed used up all he had in stock he invented
new ones When the praise service was over he turns to me and says But
what are we goin to do

Do says I Thats easy Were goin to drift

And thats what we done I tried to anchor but we want over the
ledge and the iron wouldnt reach bottom by a mile more or less I
rigged up a sail out of the oar and the canvas spray shield but there
want wind enough to give us steerageway So we drifted and drifted
out to sea And by and by the fog come down and shut us in and that
fixed what little hope I had of bein seen by the life patrol on shore

The breeze died out flat about three oclock In one way this was a
good thing In another it want because we was well out in deep water
and when the wind did come it was likely to come hardern we needed
However there want nothin to do but wait and hope for the best as
the feller said when his wifes mother was sick

It was gettin pretty well along toward the edge of the evenin when
I smelt the wind acomin It came in puffs at fust and every puff was
healthier than the one previous Inside of ten minutes it was blowin
hard and the seas were beginnin to kick up I got up my jury rigthe
oar and the spray shieldand took the helm There want nothin to
do but run afore it and the land knows where we would fetch up At any
rate if the compass was right we was drivin back into the bay again
for the wind had hauled clear around

The Shootin Star jumped and sloshed Fatty had on all the ileskins and
sweaters but he was shakin like a custard pie

Oh oh heavens he chatters What will we do Will we drown

Dont know says I tuggin at the wheel and tryin to sight the
compass Youve got the best chance of the two of us if its true that
fat floats

I thought that might cheer him up some but it didnt A big wave
heeled us over then and a keg or two of salt water poured over the
gunwale He give a yell and jumped up

My Lord he screams Were sinkin Help help

Set down I roared Thought you knew how to act in a boat Set down
dyou hear me SET DOWN AND SET STILL

He set Likewise he shivered and groaned It got darker all the time
and the wind freshened every minute I expected to see that jury mast go
by the board at any time Lucky for us it held

No use tellin about the next couple of hours Cordin to my reckonin
they was years and wed ought to have sailed plumb through the broadside
of the Cape and be makin a quick run for Africy But at last we got
into smoother water and then right acrost our bows showed up a white
strip The fog had pretty well blowed clear and I could see it

Land ho I yells Stand by WERE goin to bump

Captain Sol stopped short and listened Mr Phinney grasped his arm

For the dear land sakes Sol he exclaimed dont leave me hangin in
them breakers no longern you can help Heave ahead DID you bump

The depot master chuckled

DID we he repeated Well Ill tell you that by and by Here comes
the train and I better take charge of the ship Anything so responsible
as seein the cars come in without me to help would give Issy the
jumpin heart disease

He sprang from the truck and hastened toward the door of the station
Phinney rising to follow him saw over the dark green of the swamp
cedars at the head of the track an advancing column of smoke A whistle
sounded The train was coming in




CHAPTER II

SUPPLY AND DEMAND


And now life in East Harniss became temporarily fevered Issy McKay
dashed out of the station and rushed importantly up and down the
platform Ed Crocker and Cornelius Rowe emerged and draped themselves
in statuesque attitudes against the side of the building Obed Gott came
hurrying from his paint and oil shop which was next to the general
store Mr Higgins proprietor of the latter sauntered easily across
to receive in his official capacity as postmaster the mail bag Ten or
more citizens of both sexes and of various ages gathered in groups to
inspect and supervise

The locomotive pulled its string of cars a baggage a smoker
and two passengers alongside the platform The sliding door of the
baggage car was pushed back and the baggage master appeared in the
opening Hi Capn he shouted Hi Capn Sol Heres some express
for you

But unfortunately the Captain was in conversation with the conductor at
the other end of the train Issy willing and officious sprang forward
Ill take it Bill he volunteered Here give it to me

The baggage master handed down the package a good sized one marked
Glass With Care Issy received it clutched it to his bosom turned
and saw Gertie Higgins pretty daughter of Beriah Higgins stepping from
the first car to the platform Gertie had been staying with an aunt in
Trumet and was now returning home for a day or two

Issy stopped short and gazed at her He saw her meet and kiss her
father and the sight roused turbulent emotions in his bosom He saw her
nod and smile at acquaintances whom she passed She approached noticed
him andoh rapturesaid laughingly Hello Is Before he could
recover his senses and remember to do more than grin she had disappeared
around the corner of the station Therefore he did not see the young man
who stepped forward to shake her hand and whisper in her ear This young
man was Sam Bartlett and as a city dude Issy loathed and hated him

No Issy did not see the hurried and brief meeting between Bartlett and
Gertie Higgins but he had seen enough to cause forgetfulness of mundane
things For an instant he stared after the vanished vision Then he
stepped blindly forward tripped over somethinghis off hind leg so
Captain Sol afterwards vowedand fell sprawling the express package
beneath him

The crash of glass reached the ears of the depot master He broke away
from the conductor and ran toward his prostrate assistant Pushing
aside the delighted and uproarious bystanders he forcibly helped the
young man to rise

What in time he demanded

Issy agonizingly held the package to his ear and shook it

IIm afraid somethins cracked he faltered

The crowd set up a whoop Ed Crocker appeared to be in danger of
strangling

Cracked repeated Captain Sol Cracked he smiled in spite of
himself Yes somethins cracked Its that head of yours Issy Here
lets see

He snatched the package from the McKay hands and inspected it

Smashed to thunder he declared Whos the lucky one it belongs to
Humph He read the inscription aloud Major Cuthbertson S Hardee The
Major hey    Well Is you take the remains inside and you and Ill
hold services over it later

II didnt go to do it protested the frightened Issy

Course you didnt If you had you wouldnt Youre like the feller
in Scriptur you leave undone the things you ought to do and do them
thatAll right Jim Let her go Cast off

The conductor waved his hand the engine puffed the bell rang and
the train moved onward For another twelve hours East Harniss was left
marooned by the outside world

Beriah Higgins and the mail bag were already in the post office Thither
went the crowd to await the sorting and ultimate distribution A short
fat little man lingered and walking up to the depot master extended
his hand

Hello Sol he said smiling Thought Id stop long enough to say
Howdy anyhow

Why Bailey Stitt cried the Captain How are you Glad to see you
Thought you was down to South Orham takin out seasick parties for the
Ocean House same kind of a job I used to have in Wellmouth

I am replied Captain Stitt That is I was Just now Ive run over
here to see about contractin for a supply of clams and quahaugs for our
boarders You never see such a gang to eat as them summer folks in your
life Barzilla Wingate he says the same about his crowd Hes comin on
the mornin train from Wellmouth

You dont tell me I aint seen Barzilla for a long spell Where you
stoppin Come up to the house wont you

Cant Im goin to put up over to Obed Gotts His sister Polena
Ginn is a relation of mine by marriage So long Obeds gone on ahead
to tell Polena to put the kettle on Maybe Obed and Ill be back again
after Ive had supper

Do Ill be round here for two or three hours yet

He entered the depot Except the forlorn Issy who sat in a corner
holding the express package in his lap Simeon Phinney was the only
person in the waiting room

Come on now Sol pleaded Sim I want to hear the rest of that about
you and Williams You left off in the most ticklish place possible
out of spite I do believe Im hangin on to that boat in the breakers
until I declare I believe Im catchin cold just from imagination

Wait a minute Sim said the depot master Then he turned to his
assistant

Issy he said this is about the nineteenth time youve done just
this sort of thing Youre no earthly use and I ought to give you your
clearance papers But I cant youre toowellornamental Youve
got to be punished somehow and I guess the best way will be to send you
right up to Major Hardees and let you give him the remnants Hell
want to know how it happened and you tell him the truth The TRUTH
understand If you invent any fairy tales out of those novels of yours
Ill know it by and by andwell YOULL know I know No remarks
please Git

Issy hesitated seemed about to speak thought better of it took up
package and cap and got

Lets see said the Captain sitting down in one of the station chairs
and lighting a fresh cigar where was Williams and I in that yarn of
mine Oh yes I could see land and callated we was goin to bump
Well we did Steerin anyways but dead ahead was out of the question
and all I could do was set my teeth and trust in my bein a member
of the church The Shootin Star hit that beach like she was the real
article Overboard went oar and canvas and grub pails and everything
else that want nailed down includin Fatty and me I grabbed him by
the collar and wallowed ashore

Awk hawk he gasps chokin Im drownded

I let him BE drownded for the minute I had the launch to think of
and somehow or nother I got hold of her rodin and hauled the anchor up
above tide mark Then I attended to my passenger

Where are we he asks

I looked around Close by was nothin but beachgrass and seaweed and
sand A little ways off was a clump of scrub pines and bayberry bushes
that looked sort of familiar And back of them was a little board shanty
that looked more familiar still I rubbed the salt out of my eyes

WELL says I I swan to man

What is it he says Do you know where we are Whose house is that

I looked hard at the shanty

Humph I grunted I do declare Talk about a fellers comin back to
his own Whose shanty is that Well its mine if you want to know
The power that looks out for the lame and the lazy has hove us ashore on
Woodchuck Island and thats a piece of real estate I own

It sounds crazy enough thats a fact but it was true Woodchuck
Island is a little mite of a sand heap off in the bay two mile from
shore and ten from the nighest town Id bought it and put up a shanty
for a gunnin shack took city gunners down there once in a while
the fall before That summer Id leased it to a friend of mine name of
Darius Baker who used it while he was lobsterin The gale had driven
us straight in from sea way past Sandy Pint and on to the island
Twas like hittin a nail head in a board fence but wed done it Shows
what Providence can do when it sets out

I explained some of this to Williams as we waded through the sand to
the shanty

But is this Baker chap here now he asks

Im afraid not says I The lobster seasons about over and he was
goin South on a yacht this week Still he want to go till Saturday
and perhaps

But the shanty was empty when we got there I fumbled around in the tin
matchbox and lit the kerosene lamp in the bracket on the wall Then I
turned to Williams

Well says I were lucky for once in

Then I stopped When he went overboard the water had washed off
his hat Likewise it had washed off his long black hairwhich was a
wigand his head was all round and shiny and bald like a gulls egg
out in a rain storm

I knew he wore a wig interrupted Phinney

Of course you do Everybody does now But he want such a prophet in
Israel then as hes come to be since and folks want acquainted with
his personal beauties

What are you starin at he asks

I fetched a long breath Nothin says I Nothin

But for the rest of that next haf hour I went around in a kind of
daze as if MY wig had gone and part of my head with it When a feller
has been doin a puzzle it kind of satisfies him to find out the answer
And Id done my puzzle

I knew where Id met Mr Williams afore

You did cried Simeon

Umhm Wait a while Well Fatty went to bed in one of the hay bunks
pretty soon after that He stripped to his underclothes and turned in
under the patchwork comforters He was too beat out to want any supper
even if thered been any in sight I built a fire in the rusty cook
stove and dried his duds and mine Then I set down in the busted chair
and begun to think After a spell I got up and took account of stock as
you might say of the eatables in the shanty Darius had carted off his
own grub and what there was on hand was mine left over from the gunnin
seasona hunk of salt pork in the pickle tub some corn meal in a tin
pail some musty white flour in another pail a little coffee a little
sugar and salt and a can of condensed milk I took these things out of
the locker they was in looked em over put em back again and sprung
the padlock Then I put the key into my pocket and went back to my chair
to do some more thinkin

Next mornin I was up early and when the banker turned out I was fryin
a couple of slices of the pork and had some coffee bilin Likewise
there was a pan of johnnycake in the oven The wind had gone down
considerble but twas foggy and thick again which was a pleasin
state of things for yours truly

Williams smelt the cookin almost afore he got his eyes open

Hurry up with that breakfast he says to me Im hungry as a wolf

I didnt say nothin then just went ahead with my cookin He got into
his clothes and went outdoor Pretty soon he comes back cussin the
weather

See here Mr Williams says I how about them orders to your
housekeeper Are they straight Wont she have you hunted up for a
week

He colored pretty red but from what he said I made out that she
wouldnt I gathered that him and the old lady want real chummy She
give him his grub and her services and he give her the Old Harry and
her wages She wouldnt hunt for him not until she was ordered to
Shed be only too glad to have him out of the way

Humph says I Then I callate well enjoy the scenery on this
garden spot of creation until the weeks up

What do you mean says he

Well I says the launch is out of commission unless it should
rain gasoline and at this time of year there aint likely to be a boat
within hailin distance of this island specially if the weather holds
bad

He swore a blue streak payin particlar attention to the housekeeper
for her general stupidness and to me because Id got him so he said
into this scrape I didnt say nothin set the table with one plate
and one cup and sasser and knife and fork hauled up a chair and set
down to my breakfast He hauled up a box and set down too

Pass me that corn bread says he And why didnt you fry more pork

He was reachin out for the johnnycake but I pulled it out of his way

Wait a minute Mr Williams says I While you was snoozin last
night I made out a kind of manifest of the vittles aboard this shanty
Cordin to my figgerin heres scursely enough to last one husky man
a week let along two husky ones I paid considerble attention to your
preachin yesterday and the text seemed to be to look out for number
one Now in this case Im the one and Ive got to look out for myself
This is my shanty my island and my grub So please keep your hands off
that johnnycake

For a minute or so he set still and stared at me Didnt seem to sense
the situation as you might say Then the red biled up in his face and
over his bald head like a Fundy tide

Why you dummed villain he shouts Do you mean to starve me

You wont starve in a week says I helpin myself to pork A feller
named Tanner that I read about years ago lived for forty days on cold
water and nothin else Theres the pump right over in the corner Its
my pump but Ill stretch a pint and not charge for it this time

Youyou he stammers shakin all over he was so mad Didnt I
hire you

You hired me to take you out to the fishin grounds and back provided
the launch was made ready by YOU It want ready so THAT contracts
busted And you was to furnish your extrys and I was to furnish mine
Here they be and I need em Its as legitimate a deal as ever I see
perfect case of supply and demandsupply for one and demand for two As
I said afore Im the one

By thunder he growls standin up Ill show you

I stood up too He was fat and flabby and I was thin and wiry We
looked each other over

I wouldnt says I Youre under the doctors care you know

So he set down again not havin strength even to swear and watched me
eat my breakfast And I ate it slow

Say he says finally you think youre mighty smart dont you
Well Im It I guess for this time I suppose youll have no objection
to SELLIN me a breakfast

Noo says I not a mite of objection Ill sell you a couple of
slices of pork for five dollars a slice and

FIVE DOLLARS a His mouth dropped open like a main hatch

Sartin I says And two slabs of johnnycake at five dollars a slab
And a cup of coffee at five dollars a cup And

Youre crazy he sputters jumpin up

Not much I aint Ive been settin at your feet larnin high
finance thats all You dont seem to be onto the real inwardness of
this deal Ive got the grub market cornered thats all The market
price of necessaries is five dollars each now its likely to rise at
any time but now its five

He looked at me steady for at least two more minutes Then he got up
and banged out of that shanty A little later I see him down at the end
of the sand spit starin out into the fog lookin for a sail I presume
likely

I finished my breakfast and washed up the dishes He come in by and by
He hadnt had no dinner nor supper you see and the salt air gives most
folks an almighty appetite

Say he says Ive been thinkin Its usual in the stock and
provision market to deal on a margin Suppose I pay you a one per cent
margin now and

All right says I cheerful Then Ill give you a slip of paper
sayin that youve bought such and such slices of pork and hunks of
johnnycake and Im carryin em for you on a margin Of course there
aint no delivery of the goods now because

Humph he interrupts sour You seem to know moren I thought you
did Now are you goin to be decent and make me a fair price or aint
you

Cant sell under the latest quotations says I Thats five now and
spot cash

But hang it all he says I havent got money enough with me Think
I carry a national bank around in my clothes

You carry a Wellmouth Bank check book says I because I see it in
your jacket pocket last night when I was dryin your duds Ill take a
check

He started to say somethin and then stopped After a spell he seemed
to give in all to once

Very good he says You get my breakfast ready and Ill make out the
check

That breakfast cost him twentyfive dollars thirty really because he
added another five for an extry cup of coffee I told him to make the
check payable to Bearer as twas quicker to write than Solomon

He had two more meals that day and at bedtime I had his checks
amountin to ninetyfive dollars The fog stayed with us all the time
and nobody come to pick us up And the next mornins outlook was just as
bad bein a drizzlin rain and a high wind The mainland beach was in
sight but thats all except salt water and rain

He was surprisinly cheerful all that day eatin like a horse
and givin up his meal checks without a whimper If things had been
different from what they was Id have felt like a mean sneak thief
BEIN as they was I counted up the hundred and ten Id made that day
without a pinch of conscience

This was a Wednesday On Thursday the third day of our Robinson
Crusoe business the weather was still thick though there was signs of
clearin Fatty come to me after breakfastwhich cost him thirtyfive
payable as usual to Bearerwith almost a grin on his big face

Berry he says I owe you an apology I thought you was a green
Rube like the rest down here but youre as sharp as they make em I
aint the man to squeal when I get let in on a bad deal and the chap
who can work me for a sucker is entitled to all he can make But this
payasyougo business is too slow and troublesome Whatll you take for
the rest of the grub in the locker there spot cash Be white and make
a fair price

Id been expectin somethin like this and I was ready for him

Two hundred and sixtyfive dollars says I prompt

He done a little figgerin Well allowin that I have to put up on
this heap of desolation for the better part of four days more thats
cheap accordin to your former rates he says Ill go you But why
not make it two fifty even

Two hundred and sixtyfives my price says I So he handed over
another Bearer check and his board bill was paid for a week

Friday was a fine day clear as a bell Me and Williams had a real
picnicky sociable time Livin outdoor this way had made him forget his
diseases and the doctor and he showed signs of bein hafway decent We
loafed around and talked and dug clams to help out the porkthat is I
dug em and Fatty superintended We see no lessn three sailin craft
go by down the bay and tried our best to signal em but they didnt pay
attentionthought we was gunners or somethin I presume likely

At breakfast on Saturday Williams begun to ask questions again

Sol says he it surprised me to find that you knew what a margin
was You didnt get that from anything I said Where did you get it

I leaned back on my box seat

Mr Williams says I I callate Ill tell you a little story if
you want to hear it Taint much of a yarn as yarns go but maybe
itll interest you The start of it goes back to considerble many year
ago when I was poorern I be now and a mighty sight younger At that
time me and another feller a partner of mine had a fish weir out in
the bay here The mackerel struck in and we done well unusual well
At the end of the season not countin what wed spent for livin and
expenses we had a balance owin us at our fish dealers up to Boston
of five hundred dollarstwo fifty apiece My partner was goin to
be married in the spring and was callatin to use his share to buy
furniture for the new house with So we decided wed take a trip up
to Boston and collect the money stick it into some savins bank where
twould draw interest until spring and then haul it out and use it
Twas about every cent we had in the world

So to Boston we went collected our money got the address of a safe
bank and started out to find it But on the way my partners hat blowed
off and the bank address which was on a slip of paper inside of it got
lost So we see a sign on a buildin along with a lot of others that
kind of suggested bankin and so we stepped into the buildin and went
upstairs to ask the way again

The place want very big but twas fixed up fancy and there was a
kind of blackboard along the end of the room where a boy was markin up
figgers in chalk A nice smilin lookin man met us and when we told
him what we wanted he asked us to set down Then afore we knowed it
almost wed told him the whole storyabout the five hundred and all
The feller said to hold on a spell and hed go along with us and show us
where the savins bank was himself

So we waited and all the time the figgers kept goin up on the board
under signs of Pork and Wheat and Cotton and such and wed hear
how so and sos account was makin a thousand a day and the like of
that After a while the nice man who it turned out was one of the
bosses of the concern told us what it meant Seemed there was a big
rise in the market and them that bought now was bound to get rich
quick Consequent we said we wished we could buy and get rich too And
the smilin chap says Lets go have some lunch

Williams laughed Ho ho says he Expensive lunch was it

Most extravagant meal of vittles ever I got away with I says Cost
me and my partner two hundred and fifty apiece that lunch did We
stayed in Boston two days and on the afternoon of the second day we
was on our way back totin a couple of neat but expensive slips of paper
signifyin that wed bought December and May wheat on a one per cent
margin We was a hundred ahead already cordin to the blackboard and
was figgerin what sort of palaces wed build when we cashed in

Aint no use preachin a long sermon over the remains Twas a simple
funeral and nobody sent flowers Inside of a month we was cleaned
out and the wheat place had gone out of businessfailed busted you
understand Our fish dealer friend asked some questions and found out
the shebang want a real stock dealers at all Twas what they call
a bucket shop and wed bought nothin but air and paid a commission
for buyin it And the smilin nice man that run the swindle had been
hangin on the edge of bust for a long while and knowed twas comin
Our five hundred had helped pay his way to a healthier climate thats
all

Hold on a minute says Fatty lookin more interested What was the
name of the firm that took you greenhorns in

Twas the Empire Bond Stock and Grain Exchange says I And twas
on Derbyshire Street

He give a little jump Then he says slow Huum Isee

Yes says I I thought you would You had a mustache then and your
name was diffrent but you seemed familiar just the same When your
false hair got washed off I knew you right away

He took out his pocket pen and his check book and done a little
figgerin

Humph he says again You lost five hundred and Ive paid you five
hundred and five Whats the five for

Thats my commission on the sales I says

And just then comes a hail from outside the shanty Out we bolted
and there was Sam Davis just steppin ashore from his power boat
Williamss housekeeper had strained a pint and had shaded her orders by
a couple of days

Williams and Sam started for home right off I followed in the Shootin
Star havin borrered gasoline enough for the run I reached the dock
haf an hour after they did and there was Fatty waitin for me

Berry says he Ive got a word or two to say to you I aint
kickin at your givin me tit for tat or tryin to Turn abouts fair
play if you can call the turn But its against my principles to allow
anybody to beat me on a business deal Do you suppose he says that
Id have paid your robbers prices without a word if I hadnt had
somethin up my sleeve Why man says he I gave you my CHECKS not
cash And Ive just telephoned to the Wellmouth Bank to stop payment
on those checks Theyre no earthly use to you see Theres one or two
things about high finance that you dont know even yet Ho ho

And he rocked back and forth on his heels and laughed

I held up my hand Wait a jiffy Mr Williams says I I guess these
checks are all right When we fust landed on Woodchuck I judged by the
looks of the shanty that Baker hadnt left it for good I callated
hed be back And sure enough he come back in his catboat on Thursday
evenin after youd turned in Them checks was payable to Bearer
you remember so I give em to him He was to cash em in the fust thing
Friday mornin and I guess youll find hes done it

Well I swan to MAN interrupted the astonished and delighted Phinney
So you had him after all And I was scart youd lost every cent

Captain Sol chuckled Yes he went on I had him and his eyes and
mouth opened together

WHAT he bellers Do you mean to say that a boat stopped at that
dummed island and DIDNT TAKE US OFF

Oh says I Darius didnt feel called on to take you off not after
I told him who you was You see Mr Williams I says Darius Baker
was my partner in that wheat speculation I was tellin you about

The Captain drew a long breath and relit his cigar which had gone out
His friend pounded the settee ecstatically

There he cried I knew the name Darius Baker want so strange to
me When was you and him in partners Sol

Oh way back in the old days afore I went to sea at all and afore
mother died You wouldnt remember much about it Mother and I was
livin in Trumet then and our house here was shut up I was only a kid
or not much more and Williams was young too

And thats the way he made his money HIM Why hes the most respected
man in this neighborhood and goes to church and

Yes Well if you make money ENOUGH you can always be respectedby
some kinds of peopleand find some church thatll take you in Aint
that so Bailey

Captain Stitt and his cousin Obed Gott the paint dealer were standing
in the doorway of the station They now entered

I guess its so replied Stitt pulling up a chair though I dont
know what you was talkin about However its a pretty average safe bet
that what you say is so Sol most any time Whats the special so
this time

We was talkin about Mr Williams began Phinney

The Grand Panjandrum of East Harniss broke in the depot master East
Harniss is blessed with a great man Bailey and like considerble many
blessins he aint entirely unmixed

Obed and Simeon looked puzzled but Captain Stitt bounced in his chair
like a goodnatured rubber ball Ho ho he chuckled you dont
surprise me Sol We had a great man over to South Orham three years ago
and he begun by blessins and ended withwith tother thing Ho ho

What do you mean demanded Sim

Why I mean Stingy Gabe Youve heard of Stingy Gabe aint you

I guess weve all heard somethin about him laughed Captain Sol but
were willin to hear more He was a reformer want he

He sartin was Ho ho

For the land sakes tell it Bailey demanded Mr Gott impatiently
Dont sit there bouncin and gurglin and gettin purple in the face
Tell it or youll bust tryin to keep it in

Oh its a great long began Captain Bailey protestingly

Go on urged Phinney Weve got more time than anything else the
most of us Who was this Stingy Gabe

Yes urged Gott and what did he reform

Captain Stitt held up a compelling hand Its all of a piece he
interrupted It takes in everything like an eatinhouse stew And
as usual in them cases the feller that ordered it didnt know what was
comin to him

Stingy Gabe was that feller His Sunday name was Gabriel Atkinson
Holway and his dad used to peddle fish from Orham to Denboro and back
The old man was christened Gabriel likewise He owed most everybody
and besides was so mean that he kept the scales and trimmins of the
fish he sold to make chowder for himself and family All hands called
him Stingy Gabe and the boy inherited the name along with the
fifteen hundred dollars that the old man left when he died He cleared
outyoung Gabe didsoon as the will was settled and afore the
outstandin debts was and nobody in this latitude see hide nor hair of
him till three years ago this comin spring

Then lo and behold you he drops off the parlor car at the Orham
station and cruises down to South Orham baldheaded and baywindowed
sufferin from pomp and prosperity Seems hed been spendin his life
cornerin copper out West and then copperin the corners in Wall Street
The folks in his State couldnt put him in jail so they sent him to
Congress Now as the Honorable Atkinson Holway hed come back to the
Cape to rest his wrist which had writers cramp from signin stock
certificates and to ease his eyes with a sight of the dear old home of
his boyhood

Bill Nickerson comes postin down to me with the news

Bailey says he what do you thinks happened Stingy Gabes struck
the town

For how much I asks anxious Dont let him have it whatever
tis

Then he went on to explain Gabe was rich as all get out and twas
his intention to buy back his old mans house and fix it up for a summer
home He was delighted to find how little change there was in South
Orham

No matter if taint but fifteen cents hell get it if the slectmen
dont watch him I says and the bills too I know HIS tribe

You dont understand says Nickerson He aint no thief Hes rich
I tell you and hes callatin to do the town good

Course he is I says It runs in the family His dad done it good
toogood as twas ever done I guess

But next day Gabe himself happens along and I see right off that Id
made a mistake in my reckonin The Honorable Atkinson Holway want
figgerin to borrow nothin When a chap has been skinnin halibut
minnows are too small for him to bother with Gabe was full of fried
clams and philanthropy

By Jove Stitt he says livin here has been the dream of my life

Youll be glad to wake up wont you says I I wish I could

I tell you he says this little old village is all right All it
needs is a publicspirited resident to help it along I propose to be
the P S R

And on that program he started right in Fust off he bought his dads
old place built it over into the eightsided palace thats there now
fetched down a small army of servants skippered by an old housekeeper
and commenced to live simple but complicated Then havin provided
the needful charity for himself hes ready to scatter manna for the
starvin native

He had a dozen schemes laid out One was to build a free but expensive
library another was to pave the main road with brick third was to give
stainedglass windows and velvet cushions to the meetin house sos
the congregation could sleep comfortable in a subdued light The
stainedglass idee put him in close touch with the minister Reverend
Edwin Fisher and the minister suggested the mens club And he took to
that mens club scheme like an old maid to strong tea the rest of the
improvements went into dry dock to refit while Admiral Gabe got his
mens club off the ways

Twas the billiard room that made the minister hanker for a mens club
That billiard room was the worry of his life Old man Jotham Gale run
it and had run it sence the Concord fight in a way of speakin You
remember his sign maybe Jotham W Gale Billiard Pool and Sipio
Saloon Cigars and Tobacco Tonics and Pipes Minors under Ten Years of
Age not Admitted Jothams customers was called by the outsiders the
billiardroom gang

The billiard room gang want the best folks in town Ill own right up
to that Still they want so turrible wicked Jotham never sold rum
and hed never allow no rows in his place But just the same his
saloon was reckoned a bad influence Young men hadnt ought to go
theremost of us said that If there was a nicer place TO go argues
the minister twould help the moral tone of the community considerble
Why not says he to Stingy Gabe start a free club for men thatll
make the billiard room look like the tail boat in a race And says
Gabe Bully Ill do it

Captain Stitt paused long enough to enjoy a chuckle all by himself
Before he had quite finished his laugh slow and reluctant steps were
heard on the back platform and Issy appeared on the threshold He was
without the package but did not look happy

Well Is inquired the depot master did you give the remains to the
Major

Yes sir answered Issy

Did you tell him how the shockin fatality happened How the thing got
broken

Yes sir I told him

What did he say Didnt let his angry passions rise did he

Noo no sir he didnt rise nothin He didnt get mad neither But
you could see he felt pretty bad Talked about old family glass and
priceless airloons or some such Said much as he regretted to he
should feel it no moren justice to have somebody pay damages

Humph Captain Sol looked very grave Issy I can see your finish
Youll have to pay for somethin thats priceless and how are you goin
to do that Old family glass hey Hum And I thought I saw the label
of a Boston store on that package

Obed Gott leaned forward eagerly

Is that Major Hardee youre talkin about he asked

Yes sir Hes the only Major weve got Capns are plenty as June
bugs but Majors and Genrals are scarce Why

Oh nothin Only Mr Gott muttered the remainder of the sentence
under his breath However the depot master heard it and his eye
twinkled

Youre glad of it he exclaimed Why Obed Major Cuthbertson Scott
Hardee Im surprised Better not let the women folks hear you say
that

Look here cried Captain Stitt rather tartly am I goin to finish
that yarn of mine or dont you want to hear it

BEG your pardon Bailey Go on The last thing you said was what Stingy
Gabe said and that was




CHAPTER III

STINGY GABE


And that said Captain Bailey mollified by the renewed interest of
his listeners was Bully Ill do it

So he calls a meetin of everybody interested at his new house About
every respectable man in town was there includin me Most of the
billiardroom gang was there likewise Jotham of course want
invited

Gabe calls the meetin to order and the minister makes a speech tellin
about the scheme Our generous and publicspirited citizen Honorable
Atkinson Holway had offered to build a suitable clubhouse fix it up
and donate it to the club them and their heirs forever Amen Twas to
belong to the members to do what they pleased withno strings tied to
it at all Dues would be merely nominal a dollar a year or some such
matter Now who favored such a club as that

Well most everybody did Daniel Bassett chronic politician justice
of the peace and head of the Conservatives at town meetin he made
a talk and in comes him and his crew Gaius Ellis another chronic who
is postmaster and skipper of the Progressives had been fidgetin
in his seat and now up he bobs and says hes for it then every
Progressive jines immediate But the billiardroomers they didnt
jine They looked sort of sheepish and set still When Mr Fisher begun
to hint pinted in their direction they got up and slid outdoor And
right then Id ought to have smelt trouble but I didnt had a cold in
my head I guess likely

Next thing was to build the new clubhouse and Gabe went at it hammer
and tongs He had a big passel of carpenters down from the city and
inside of three months the buildin was up and she was a daisy now I
tell you There was a readin room and a meetin room and an amusement
room The amusements was crokinole and parchesi and checkers and the
like of that Also there was a gymnasium and a place where you could
play the pianner and singtill the sufferin got acute and somebody
come along and abated you

When I fust went inside that clubhouse I see twas bound to be
Goodby Bill for Jotham His customers would shake his ratty old
shanty for sartin soons they see them elegant new rooms I swan if I
didnt feel sorry for the old reprobate and thinks I Ill drop around
and sympathize a little Sympathy dont cost nothin and Jothams
pretty good company

I found him settin alongside the peanut roaster watchin a couple of
patients cruelize the pool table

Hello Bailey says he You surprise me Aint you fraid of
catchin somethin in this hant of sin Have a chair anyhow And a
cigar wont you

I took the chair but I steered off from the cigar havin had
experience Told him I guessed Id use my pipe He chuckled

Fur be it from me to find fault with your judgment he says
Terbacker does smoke bettern anything else dont it

We set there and puffed for five minutes or so Then he sort of jumped

Whats up says I

Oh nothin he says Bije Simmons got a ball in the pocket thats
all Dont do that too often Bije I got a weak heart Well Bailey
he adds turnin to me Gabes clubs fixed up pretty fine aint it

Why yes I says tis

Finest ever I see says he I told him so when I was in there

What says I You dont mean to say YOUVE been in that clubroom

Sartin Why not I want to take in all the shows there isspecially
the free ones Make a good billiard room that clubhouse would

I whistled Whew says I Didnt tell Gabe THAT did you

He nodded Yup says he I told him

I whistled again What answer did he make I asked

Oh he want enthusiastic Seemed to callate Id better shut up my
head and my shop along with it afore he knocked off one and his club
knocked out tother

I pitied the old rascal I couldnt help it

Jotham says I I aint the wust friend youve got in South Orham
even if I dont play pool much If I was you Id clear out of here and
start somewheres else You cant fight all the best folks in town

He didnt make no answer Just kept on apuffin I got up to go Then
he laid his hand on my sleeve

Bailey says he when Betsy Mayo was ailin her sisters tribe was
all for the Faith Cure and her husbands relations was high for patent
medicine When the Faith Curists got to workin in would come some of
the patent mediciners and give em the bounce And when THEY went home
for the night the Faithers would smash all the bottles Finally they
got so busy fightin mong themselves that Betsy see she was gettin no
better fast and sent for the reglar doctor HE done the curin and
got the pay

Well says I what of it

Nothin says he Only Ive been practisin a considerable spell So
long Come in again some time when its dark and the respectable element
cant see you

I went away thinkin hard And next mornin I hunted up Gabe and says
I

Mr Holway I says what puzzles me is how youre goin to elect the
officers for the new club Put up a Conservative and the Progressives
resign Hist the Progressive ensign and the Conservativesll mutiny As
for the billiardroomersprovidin any jinetheyve never been known
to vote for anybody but themselves I cant see no light yetnothin
but fog

He winks sly and profound Thats all right says he Fisher and I
have planned that You watch

Sure enough they had The minister was mighty popular so when twas
out that he was candidate to be fust president of the club all hands
was satisfied Two vice presidents was namedone bein Bassett and
tother Ellis Secretary was a leadin Conservative treasurer a head
Progressive Officers and crew was happy and mutiny sunk ten fathoms
ONLY none of the billiardroom gang had jined and they was the fish we
was really tryin for

Twas next March afore one of em did come into the net though wed
have on all kinds of baitsuppers and free ice cream Saturday nights
and the like of that And meantime things had been happenin

The fust thing of importance was Gabes leavin town Our Cape winter
weather was what fixed him He stood the notheasters and Scotch
drizzles till January and then he heads for Key West and comfort
Said his heart still beat warm for his native village but his feet was
frozeor words similar He callated to be back in the spring Then
the Reverend Fisher got a call to somewheres in York State and felt
he couldnt afford not to hear it Nobody blamed him the salary paid
a minister in South Orham is enough to make any feller buy patent ear
drums But that left our mens club without either skipper or pilot as
you might say

One week after the farewell sermon Daniel Bassett drops in casual on
me He was passin around smoking material lavish and regardless

Stitt says he youve always voted for Conservatism in our local
affairs havent you

Well says I I didnt vote to roof the town hall with a new
mortgage if thats what you mean

Exactly he says Now our mens club while not as yet the success
we hoped for has come to be a power for good in our community It needs
for its president a conservative thoughtful man Bailey he says it
has come to my ears that Gaius Ellis intends to run for that office You
know him As a taxpayer as a sober thoughtful citizen my gorge rises
at such insolence I protest sir I protest against

He was standin up makin gestures with both arms and he had his
townmeetin voice iled and runnin I was too busy to hanker for a
stump speech so I cut across his bows

All right all right says I Ill vote for you Dan

He fetched a long breath Thank you says he Thank you That makes
ten Ellis can count on no more than nine My election is assured

Seein that there want but nineteen reglar voters who come to the
club meetins if Bassett had ten of em it sartin did look as if hed
get in But on election night what does Gaius Ellis do but send a wagon
after old man Solomon Peavey whod been dry docked with rheumatiz
for three months and Sols vote evened her up Twas ten to ten a
deadlock and the election was postponed for another week

This was of a Tuesday On Wednesday I met Bije Simmons the chap who
was playin pool at Jothams

Hey Bailey says he Shake hands with a brother Im goin to jine
the mens club

You BE says I surprised enough for Simmons was a billiardroomer
from way back

Yup he says Ill be voted in at next meetin sure Im studyin
up on parchesi now

Hum I says thinkin How you goin to vote

Me says he Me Why man I wonder at you Cant you see the
fires of Conservatism blazin in my eyes Im Conservative bred and
Conservative born and when Im dead therell be a Conservative gone
By by See you Tuesday night

He went off stoppin everybody he met to tell em the news And on
Thursday Ed Barnes dropped in to pay me the seventyfive cents hed
borrowed two years ago come Fourth of July When Id got over the
fust shock and had counted the money three times I commenced to ask
questions

Somebody die and will you a million Ed I wanted to know

No says he Its the reward of virtue Im goin to be a better
man Im jinin the mens club

NO says I for Ed was as strong a billiardroomer as Bije

Sure he answers Im filled full of desires for crokinole and
progressiveness See you Tuesday night at the meetin

And would you blieve it at that meetin no lessn six confirmed
members of the billiardroom gang was voted into the mens club Twas
a hallelujah gatherin I couldnt help thinkin how glad and proud
Gabe and Mr Fisher would have been to see their dreams comin true
But Bassett and Ellis looked more worried than glad and when the votin
took place I understood the reason Them new members had divided even
and the ballots stood Bassett thirteen and Ellis thirteen The tie was
still on and the election was put off for another week

In that week surprisin as it may seem two more billiardroomers seen
a light and jined with us However one was for Bassett and tother for
Ellis so the deadlock want broken Jotham had only a couple of his
reglars left and I swan to man if THEY didnt catch the disease inside
of the follerin fortnit and hand in their names The Billiard Pool
and Sipio Saloon from bein the liveliest place in town was now the
deadest Through the window you could see poor Jotham mopin lonesome
among his peanuts and cigars The sayin concernin the hardness of
the transgressors sleddin was workin out for HIM all right But the
conversions had come so sudden that I couldnt understand it though I
did have some suspicions

Look here Dan says I to Bassett are you goin to keep this up
till judgment There aint but thirty votin names in this placeexcept
the chaps off fishin and they wont be back till fall Fifteen is for
you and fifteen for Gaius Most astonishin agreement of difference ever
I see Well never have a president at this rate

He winked Wont hey he says Sure youve counted right I make it
thirtyone

I dont see how says I puzzled Nobodys left outside the club but
Jotham himself and he

Thats all right he interrupts winkin again You be on hand next
Tuesday night You cant always tell maybe somethinll happen

I was on hand all right and somethin did happen two somethins in
fact We hadnt much moren got in our seats afore the door opened
and in walked Gaius Ellis arm in arm with a man and the man was the
Honorable Stingy Gabe Atkinson Holway

Gentlemen sings out Gaius bubblin over with joy I propose three
cheers for our founder who has returned to us after his long absence

We give the cheersthat is some of the folks did Bassett and our
gang want cheerin much they looked as if somebody had passed em
a counterfeit note You see Gabe Holway was one of the hideboundest
Progressives afloat and a blind man could see whod got him back again
and which way hed vote It sartinly looked bad for Bassett now

Gaius proposes that out of compliment as founder of the club Mr
Holway be asked to preside So he was asked though the Conservatives
want very enthusiastic Gabe took the chair preached a little sermon
about bein glad to see his native home once more and raps for order

If theres no other business afore the meetin says he we will
proceed to ballot for president

But it turned out that there was other business Dan Bassett riz to his
feet and commenced one of the most feelin addresses ever I listened to

Fust he congratulated all hands upon the success of Mr Holways
philanthropic scheme for the betterment of South Orhams male citizens
Jeered at at fust by the unregenerate it had gone on winnin its way
into the hearts of the people until one by one the said unregenerate
had regenerated and now the club numbered thirty souls and the
Honorable Atkinson

But says Dan wavin his arms one man yet remains outside One
lone man The chief sinner you say Yes I admit it But gentlemen
a repentant sinner Alone he sits amid the wreck of his businessa
business wrecked by us gentlemenwithout a customer without a friend
Shall it be said that the free and openhanded mens club of South Orham
turned its back upon one man merely because he HAS been what he was
Gentlemen I have talked with Jotham Gale he is old he is friendless
he no longer has a means of livelihoodwe have taken it from him We
have turned his followers steps to better paths Shall we not turn
his also Gentlemen and friends Jotham Gale is repentant he feels
his ostrichismwhatever he meant by thathe desires to become
selfrespecting and he asks us to help him He wishes to join this
club Gentlemen I propose for membership in our association the name of
Jotham W Gale

He set down and mopped his face And the powwow that broke loose was
somethin tremendous Of course twas plain enough what Dans game was
This was the somethin that was goin to happen

Ellis see the way the land lay and he bounces up to protest Twas
an outrage a scandal ridiculous and so forth and so on Poor Gabe
didnt know what to do and so he didnt do nothin A head Conservative
seconds Jothams nomination Twas put to a vote and carried easy Dans
speech had had its effect and a good many folks voted out of sympathy
How did I vote ILL never tell you

And then Bassett gets up smilin goes to the outside door opens it
and leads in the new member Hed been waitin on the steps it turned
out Jotham looked mighty quiet and meek I pitied the poor old codger
moren ever Snaked in he was out of the wet like a yeller dog by
the club that had kicked him out of his own shop

Chairman Gabe pounds for order and suggests that the votin can go on
But Ellis jumps up and says he

Whats the sense of votin now he asks sarcastic Will the lost
lamb weve just yanked into the fold have the face to stand up and bleat
that he hasnt promised to vote Conservative Dan Bassett of all the
contemptible tricks that ever

Bassetts face was reddern a ripe tomatter He shakes his fist in
Gaiuss face and yells opinions and comments

Dont you talk to me about tricks you wardheeler he hollers
Why did you fetch Mr Holway back home Why did you hey That was the
trickiest trick that I

Gabe pretty nigh broke his mallet thumpin

Gentlemen gentlemen says he This is most unseemly Sit down
if you PLEASE Mr Ellis when the purpose of this association is
considered it seems to me very wrong to find fault because the chief of
our former antagonists has seen the error of his ways and become one of
us Mr Bassett I do not understand your intimation concernin myself
I shall adjourn this meetin until next Friday evenin gentlemen
Meanwhile let us remember that we ARE gentlemen

He thumped the desk once and parades out of the buildin dignified
as Julius Caesar The rest of us toddled along after him all talkin at
once Bassett and Ellis glowered at each other and hove out hints about
what would happen afore they got through Twas halfpast ten afore I
got to bed that night and Sarah Jthats Mrs Stittkept me awake
another hour explainin whys and wherefores

For the next three days nobody done anything but knock off work and
talk club politics Youd see em on the corners and in the post office
and camped on the meetinhouse steps arguin and jawin Dan and Gaius
was hurryin around moppin their foreheads and lookin worried On
Thursday there was all sorts of rumors afloat Finally they all simmered
down to one and that one was what made me stop Stingy Gabe on the
street and ask for my bearins

Mr Holway says I is it true that Dan and Gaius have resigned and
agreed to vote for somebody else

He nodded grand and complacent

Then whos the somebody says I For the land sakes tell me Its
as big a miracle as the prodigal son

I remember now that the prodigal son aint a miracle but I was excited
then

Stitt says he I am the somebody as you call it I have decided
to let my own wishes and inclinations count for nothin in this affair
and to accept the office of president myself It will be announced at
the meetin

I whistled By gum says I Youve got a great head Mr Holway and
I give you public credit for it Its the only course that aint full of
breakers Did you think of it yourself

He colored up a little Why no not exactly he says The fact is
the credit belongs to our new member Mr Gale

To JOTHAM says I astonished

Yes He suggested my candidacy as a compromise Said that he for
one would be proud to vote for me Mr Gale seems thoroughly repentant
a changed man I am counting on him for great things in the future

So the fuss seemed settled thanks to the last person on earth youd
expect would be peacemaker But that afternoon I met Darius Tompkins
Bassetts righthand man

Bailey says he youre a Conservative aint you Youre for Dan
through thick and thin

Why says I I understand Dan and Gaius are both out of it now and
its settled on Holway Dans promised to vote for him

HE has says Tompkins with a wink but the rest of us aint We
pledged our votes to Dan Bassett and we aint the kind to go back on
our word Dan himselfll vote for Gabe soll Gaius and his reglar
tribe Thatll make twelve countin Holways own

Make seventeen you mean says I Gaius and his crowds fifteen and
Dans sixteen and Gabes seven

He winked again and interrupted me Youre countin wrong my boy
says he Five of Gaiuss folks come from the old billiardroom gang
Just suppose somethin happened to make that five vote on the quiet
for Bassett Then

A customer come in then and Tompkins had to leave but afore he went
he got me to one side and whispers

Keep mum old man and vote straight for Dan Well show old Holway
that we cant be led around by the nose

Tompkins says I I know your head well enough to be sartin that it
didnt work this out by itself And why are you so sure of the billiard
roomers Who put you up to this

He rapped the side of his nose The smartest politician in this
town says he and the oldestJ W Gale Esq Ssshh Dont say
nothin

I didnt say nothin I was past talk And that evenin as I went past
the billiard room on my way home who should come out of it but Gaius
Ellis and HE looked as happy as Tompkins had

Friday night that clubroom was filled Every member was there and most
of em had fetched their wives and families along to see the fun There
was whisperin and secrecy everywheres Honorable Gabe took the chair
and makes announcements that the shebang is open for business

Up gets Dave Bassett and all but sheds tears He says that he made up
his mind to vote not for himself but for the founder and patron of
the club the Honorable Atkinson Holway He spread it over Gabe thick
as sugar on a youngsters cake And when he set down all hands applauded
like fury But I noticed that he hadnt spoke for nary Conservative but
himself

Then Gaius Ellis rises and sobs similar Hes stopped votin for
himself too His ballot is for that grand and good man Gabriel
Atkinson Holway Esq More applause and hurrahs

And then who should get up but Jotham Gale He talks humble like a
hasbeen that knows hes a back number but he says its his privilege
to cast his fust vote in that club for Mr Holway South Orhams pride
Nobody was expectin him to say anything and the cheers pretty nigh
broke the winders

Gabe was turrible affected by the soft soap you could see that He
fairly sobbed as he sprinkled gratitude and acceptances When the agony
was over he says the votin can begin

I callated he expected somebodyd move to make it unanimous but they
didnt So the blank ballots was handed around and the pencils got
busy Gabe appints three tellers Bassett and Ellis of course for
twoand the third Jotham Gale

As a compliment to our newest member says the chairman smilin
philanthropic

When the votes was in the hat the tellers retired to the amusement
room to count up It took a long time I see the Conservatives and
Progressives nudgin each other and winkin back and forth Five
minutes then ten then fifteen

And all of a sudden the biggest row bust loose in that amusement room
that ever you heard Rattletybang Biff Smash The door flew open
and in rolled Bassett and Ellis all legs and arms Gabe and some of the
rest hauled em apart and held em so but the language them two hove at
each other was enough to bring down a judgment

Gentlemen gentlemen hollers poor Gabe What in the world I am
astounded I

You miserable traitor shrieks Gaius wavin a fist at Dan

You lowdown hound whoops Dan back at him

Silence bellers Gabe poundin thunder storms on the desk Will
some one explain why these maniacs areAh Mr Galethank goodness
YOU at least are sane

Jotham walks to the front of the platform He was holdin the hat and a
slip of paper with the result set down on it

Ladies and feller members says he theres been some surprisin
votin done in this election Things aint gone as we callated they
would somehow Mr Holway your election want unanimous after all

The way he said it made most everybody think Gabe was elected anyhow
and I guess Holway thought so himself for he smiled forgivin and says

Never mind Mr Gale says he A unanimous vote was perhaps too much
to expect Go on

Yes says Jotham Well heres the way it stands Ill read it to
you

He fixes his specs and reads like this

Number of votes cast 32

Honorable Atkinson Holway has 4

WHAT gasps Stingy Gabe fallin into his chair

Yes sir says Jotham Its a shame I know but it looks as nobody
voted for you Mr Holway but yourself and me and Dan and Gaius To
proceed

Daniel Bassett has 9

The Conservatives and their women folks fairly groaned out loud
Tompkins jumped to his feet but Jotham held up a hand

Just a moment Drius he says I aint through yet

Gaius Ellis has 9

Then twas the Progressives turn to groan The racket and hubbub was
gettin louder all the time

Theres ten votes left goes on Jotham and they bear the name
of Jotham W Gale I cant understand it but it does appear that Im
elected president of this ere club Gentlemen I thank you for the
honor which is as great as tis unexpected

Gabe and the Progressives and the Conservatives set and looked at each
other And up jumps Bije Simmons and calls for three cheers for the
new president

Nobody jined in them cheers but the old billiard room gang they did
though every one of em and Jotham smiled fatherly down on his flock

I spose there aint no need of explainin Jotham had worked it all
from the very fust When the tie business begun and Gaius and Dan was
bribin the billiard roomers to jine the club twas him that fixed how
they should vote sos to keep the deadlock goin Twas him that put
Bassett up to proposin him as a member Twas him that suggested Gabes
comin back to Gaius Twas him thatBut whats the use Twas him all
along He was IT

That night everybody but the billiardroom gang sent in their
resignation to that club We refused to be bossed by such people Gabe
resigned too He was disgusted with East Harniss and all hands in it
Hed have took back the clubhouse but he couldnt as the deed of gift
was free and clear But he swore hed never give it another cent

Folks thought that would end the thing because it wouldnt be
selfsupportin but Jotham had different idees He simply moved his
pool tables and truck up from the old shop and now hes got the finest
place of the kind on the Cape rent free

I told you twould make a good billiard saloon didnt I Bailey he
says chucklin

Jotham says I of your kind youre a perfect wonder

Well says he I diagnosed that mens club as sufferin from acute
politics Ive been doctorin that disease for a long time The trouble
with you reformers he adds solemn is that when it comes to
political doins you aint practical

As for Stingy Gabe he shut up his fine house and moved to New York
Said he was through with helpin the moral tone

When I die he says to me if I go to the bad place I may start in
reformin that It dont need it no moren South Orham does but twill
be enough sight easier job

And concluded Captain Stitt as soon as he could be heard above the
Haw haws caused by the Honorable Holways final summingup of his
native town I aint so sure that he was greatly mistook What do you
think Sol

The depot master shook his head Dont know Bailey he answered
dryly Ill have to visit both places fore I give an opinion I HAVE
been to South Orham but the neighborhood that your friend Gabe compared
it to I aint seenyet I put on that yet he added with a wink
cause I knew Sim Phinney would if I didnt

Captain Bailey rose and covered a yawn with a plump hand

I believe Ill go over to Obeds and turn in he said Im sleepy as
a ministers horse tonight You dont mind do you Obed

Noo replied Mr Gott slowly No I dont special I kind of
thought Id run into the club a few minutes and see some of the other
fellers But it aint importantnot very

The club was one of the rooms over Mr Higginss store and post
office It had been recently fitted up with chairs and tables from
its members garrets and when the depot and store were closed was a
favorite gathering place of those reckless ones who cared to set up
latethat is until eleven oclock Most of the men in town belonged
but many Captain Berry among them visited the room but seldom

Checkers said the depot master referring to the clubs favorite
game is too deliberately excitin for me To watch Beriah Higgins and
Ezra Weeks fightin out a game of checkers is like gettin your feet
froze in January and waitin for spring to come and thaw em out Its a
numbin kind of dissipation

But Obed Gott was a regular attendant at the club and tonight he
had a particular reason for wishing to be there His cousin noticed his
hesitation and made haste to relieve his mind

Thats all right Obed he said go to the club by all means I
aint such a stranger at your house that I cant find my way to bed
without help Goodnight Sim Goodnight Issy Cheer up maybe the
Majors glassware IS priceless So long Capn Sol See you again some
time tomorrer

He and Mr Gott departed The depot master rose from his chair Issy
he commanded shut up shop

Issy obeyed closing the windows and locking the front door Captain
Sol himself locked the ticket case and put the cash till into the small
safe

Thatll do Is said the Captain Goodnight Dont worry too much
over the Majors glass Ill talk with him myself You dream about
pleasanter thingsyour girl if youve got one

That was a chance shot but it struck Issy in the heart Even during
his melancholy progress to and from Major Hardees the vision of Gertie
Higgins had danced before his greenishblue eyes His freckles were
engulfed in a surge of blushes as with a stammered Night Capn
Berry he hurried out into the moonlight

The depot master blew out the lamps Come on Sim he said briefly
Goin to walk up with me or was YOU goin to the club

Callate Ill trot along with you if you dont mind Id just as soon
get home early and wrastle with the figures on that Williams movin
job

They left the depot locked and dark passed the general store where
Mr Higgins was putting out his lights prior to adjournment to the
club overhead walked up Main Street to Cross Street turned and began
climbing the hill Simeon spoke several times but his friend did not
answer A sudden change had come over him The good spirits with which
he told of his adventure with Williams and which had remained during
Phinneys stay at the depot were gone apparently His face in the
moonlight was grave and he strode on his hands in his pockets

At the crest of the hill he stopped

Goodnight Sim he said shortly and turning walked off

The building mover gazed after him in surprise The nearest way to the
Berry home was straight down Cross Street on the other side of the
hill to the Shore Road and thence along that road for an eighth of
a mile The Captains usual course was just that But tonight he had
taken the long route the Hill Boulevard which made a wide curve before
it descended to the road below

Sim who had had a shrewd suspicion concerning his friends silence and
evident mental disturbance stood still looking and wondering Olive
Edwards Captain Berrys old sweetheart lived on the Boulevard She
was in trouble and the Captain knew it He had asked that very evening
what she was going to do when forced to move Phinney could not tell
him Had he gone to find out for himself Was the mountain at last
coming to Mohammed

For some minutes Simeon remained where he was thinking and surmising
Then he too turned and walked cautiously up the Boulevard He
passed the Williams mansion its library windows ablaze He passed
the twentyfive room cottage of the gentleman from Chicago Then
he halted Opposite him was the little Edwards dwelling and shop The
curtains were up and there was a lamp burning on the small counter
Beside the lamp in a rocking chair sat Olive Edwards the widow
sewing As he gazed she dropped the sewing in her lap and raised her
head

Phinney saw how worn and sad she looked And yet how young considering
her forty years and all she had endured and must endure She put her
hand over her eyes then removed it wearily A lump came in Simeons
throat If he might only help her if SOME ONE might help her in her
lonely misery

And then from where he stood in the shadow of the Chicago gentlemans
hedge he saw a figure step from the shadows fifty feet farther on
It was Captain Solomon Berry He walked to the middle of the road
and halted looking in at Olive Phinneys heart gave a jump Was the
Captain going into that house going to HER after all these years WAS
the mountain

But no For a full minute the depot master stood looking in at the
woman by the lamp Then he jammed his hands into his pockets wheeled
and tramped rapidly off toward his home Simeon Phinney went home also
but it was with a heavy heart that he sat down to figure the cost of
moving the Williams pure Colonial to its destined location




CHAPTER IV

THE MAJOR


The depot master and his friend Mr Phinney were not the only ones
whose souls were troubled that evening Obed Gott as he stood at the
foot of the stairs leading to the meeting place of the club was vexed
and worried His cousin Captain Stitt had gone into the house and up
to his room and Obed after seeing him safely on his way had returned
to the club But instead of entering immediately he stood in the
Higgins doorway thinking and frowning as he thought And the subject
of his thought was the idol of feminine East Harniss the oldschool
gentleman Major Cuthbertson Scott Hardee

The Major first came to East Harniss one balmy morning in Marchcame
and created an immediate sensation Redny Blount who drives the
depot wagon was wrestling with a sample trunk belonging to the
traveling representative of Messrs Braid  Gimp of Boston when he
heard a voiceand such a voicesaying

Pardon me my dear sir but may I trouble you for one moment

Now Redny was not used to being addressed as my dear sir He turned
wonderingly and saw the Major in all his glory standing beside him
Rednys gaze took in the tall slim figure in the frock coat tightly
buttoned took in the white hair worn just long enough to touch
the collar of the frock coat the long drooping white mustache and
imperial the oldfashioned stock and open collar the black and white
checked trousers the gaiters and last of all the flat brimmed
carefully brushed oldfashioned silk hat Mr Blount gasped

Huh he said

Pardon me my dear sir repeated the Major blandly smoothly and
with an air ofwell not condescension but gracious familiarity Will
you be so extremely kind as to inform me concerning the most direct
route to the hotel or boarding house

The word hotel was the only part of this speech that struck home to
Rednys awed mind

Hotel he repeated slowly Why yes sir Im goin right that way
If youll git right into my barge Ill fetch you there in ten minutes

There was enough in this reply and the manner in which it was
delivered to have furnished the station idlers in the ordinary course
of events with matter for gossip and discussion for a week Mr Blount
had not addressed a person as sir since he went to school But no
one thought of this all were too much overcome by the splendor of the
Majors presence

Thank you replied the Major Thank you I am obliged to you sir
Augustus you may place the baggage in this gentlemans conveyance

Augustus was an elderly negro very black as to face and a trifle shabby
as to clothes but with a shadow of his masters gentility like a
reflected luster pervading his person He bowed low departed and
returned dragging a large old style trunk and carrying a plump valise

Augustus said the Major you may sit upon the seat with the driver
That is he added courteously if MrMr

Blount prompted the gratified Redny

If Mr Blount will be good enough to permit you to do so

Why sartin Jump right up Giddap you

There was but one passenger besides the Major and Augustus in the
depot wagon that morning This passenger was Mrs Polena Ginn who had
been to Brockton on a visit To Mrs Polena the Major raising his hat
in a manner that no native of East Harniss could acquire by a lifetime
of teaching observed that it was a beautiful morning The flustered
widow replied that it was so This was the beginning of a conversation
that lasted until the Central House was reached a conversation that
left Polena impressed with the idea that her new acquaintance was as
near the pink of perfection as mortal could be

It want his clothes nuther she told her brother Obed Gott as
they sat at the dinner table I dont know what twas but you could
jest see that he was a gentleman all over I wouldnt wonder if he was
one of them New York millionaires like Mr Williamsbut SO different
Redny Blount says he see his name onto the hotel register and twas
Cuthbertson Scott Hardee Aint that a tony name for you And his
darky man called him Major I never see sech manners on a livin soul
Obed I DO wish youd stop eatin pie with a knife

Under these pleasing circumstances did Major Cuthbertson Scott Hardee
make his first appearance in East Harniss and the reputation spread
abroad by Mr Blount and Mrs Ginn was confirmed as other prominent
citizens met him and fell under the spell In two short weeks he
was the most popular and respected man in the village The Methodist
minister said at the Thursday evening sociable that Major Hardee is
a true type of the oldschool gentleman whereupon Beriah Higgins who
was running for selectman and therefore felt obliged to be interested
in all educational matters asked whereabouts that school was located
and who was teaching it now

It was a treat to see the Major stroll down Main Street to the post
office every pleasant spring morning Coat buttoned tight silk hat the
veriest trifle on one side one glove on and its mate carried with
the cane in the other hand and the buttonhole bouquetalways the
bouquetas fresh and bright and jaunty as its wearer himself

It seemed that every housekeeper whose dwelling happened to be situated
along that portion of the main road had business in the front yard at
the time of the Majors passing There were steps to be swept or rugs
to be shaken or doorknobs to be polished just at that particular time
Dialogues like the following interrupted the triumphal progress at three
minute intervals

Goodmorning Mrs Sogberry GOODmorning A delightful morning Busy
as the proverbial bee once more I see I can never cease to admire the
industry and model neatness of the Massachusetts housekeeper And how is
your charming daughter this morning Better I trust

Well now Major Hardee I dont know Abbie aint so wells I wish she
was She set up a spell yesterday but the doctor says she aint gittin
along the way shed ought to I says to him sI Abbie aint never
what youd call a reel hearty eater but my land when she dont eat
NOTHIN I says

And so on and so on with the Major always willing to listen always
sympathetic and always so charmingly courteous

The Central House East Harnisss sole hotel and a very small one at
that closed its doors on April 10th Mr Godfrey its proprietor
had come to the country for his health He had been inveigled by an
advertisement in a Boston paper into buying the Central House at East
Harniss It would afford him so he reasoned light employment and a
living The employment was light enough but the living was lighter He
kept the Central House for a year Then he gave it up as a bad job and
returned to the city I might keep my health if I stayed he admitted
in explaining his position to Captain Berry but if I want to keep
to what little money I have left Id better go Might as well die of
disease as starvation

Everyone expected that the gentleman of the old school would go also
but one evening Abner Payne whose business is real estate fire and
life insurance justice of the peace and houses to let and for sale
rushed into the post office to announce that the Major had leased the
Gorham place furnished and intended to make East Harniss his home

He likes the village so well hes goin to stay here always explained
Abner Says hes been all round the world but he never see a place he
liked so wells he does East Harniss Hows that for high hey And you
callin it a onehorse town Obed Gott

The Major moved into the Gorham place the next morning Itthe
placewas an oldfashioned house on the hill though not on Mr
Williams Boulevard It had been one of the finest mansions in town
once on a time but had deteriorated rapidly since old Captain Elijah
Gorham died Augustus carried the Majors baggage from the hotel to
the house This was done very early and none of the natives saw the
transfer There was some speculation as to how the darky managed to
carry the big trunk singlehanded one of two persons asked Augustus
this very question but they received no satisfactory answer Augustus
was habitually closemouthed Mr Godfrey left town that same morning on
the first train

The Major christened his new home Silverleaf Hall because of two
great silverleaf trees that stood by the front door He had some
repairing paper hanging and painting done ordered a big stock of
groceries from the local dealer and showed by his every action that
his stay in East Harniss was to be a lengthy one He hired a pew in the
Methodist church and joined the club Augustus did the marketing for
Silverleaf Hall and had evidently been promoted to the position of
housekeeper

The Major moved in April It was now the third week in June and
his popularity was if possible more pronounced than ever On this
particular the evening of Captain Bailey Stitts unexpected arrival
Obed had been sitting by the tea table in his dining room after supper
going over the account books of his paint paper and oil store His
sister Mrs Polena Ginn was washing dishes in the kitchen

Wats that letter youre readin Obed she called from her post by
the sink

Nothin said her brother gruffly crumpling up the sheet of note
paper and jamming it into his pocket

My sakes youre shortern pie crust tonight Whats the matter
Anything gone wrong at the store

No

Silence again only broken by the clatter of dishes Then Polena said

Obed when are you goin to take me up to the clubroom sos I can see
that picture of Major Hardee that he presented the club with Everybody
says its just lovely Sarah T says its perfectly elegant only not
quite so handsome as the Major reelly is She says it dont flatter him
none

Humph Anybodyd think Hardee was some kind of a wonder the way you
women folks go on bout him How do you know but what he might be a
reglar fraud Looks aint everything

Well I never Obed Gott I should think youd be shamed of yourself
talkin that way I shant speak another word to you tonight I never
see you act so unlikely An old fraud The idea That grand noble man

Obed tried to make some sort of halfhearted apology but his sister
wouldnt listen to it Polenas dignity was touched She was a woman of
consequence in East Harniss was Polena Her husband had at his death
left her ten thousand dollars in her own right and she owned bonds
and had money in the Wellmouth Bank Nobody not even her brother was
allowed to talk to her in that fashion

To tell the truth Obed was sorry he had offended his sister He had
been throwing out hints of late as to the necessity of building an
addition to the paint and oil store and had cast a longing look upon
a portion of Polenas ten thousand The lady had not promised to extend
the financial aid but she had gone so far as to say she would think
about it So Obed regretted his insinuations against the Majors
integrity

After a while he threw the account books upon the top of the chest of
drawers put on his hat and coat and announced that he was going over
to the depot for a spell Polena did not deign to reply so after
repeating the observation he went out and slammed the door

Now two hours later as he stood in the doorway of the club he was
debating what he should do in a certain matter That matter concerned
Major Hardee and was therefore an extremely delicate one At length
Mr Gott climbed the narrow stairs and entered the clubroom It was blue
with tobacco smoke

The six or eight members present hailed him absently and went on with
their games of checkers or sevenup He attempted a game of checkers
and lost which did not tend to make his temper any sweeter His ill
nature was so apparent that Beriah Higgins who suffered from dyspepsia
and consequent ill temper finally commented upon it

Whats the matter with you Obed he asked tartly Too much of
Plenas mince pie

No grunted Mr Gott shortly

What is it then Aint paint sellin well

Sellin well nough I could sell a hundred ton of paint tomorrow
moren likely but when it come to gittin the money for it that would
be another story If folks would pay their bills there wouldnt be no
trouble

Whos stuck you now

I dont spose anybody has but its just as bad when they dont
pay up Ive got to have money to keep agoin with It dont make
no diffrence if its as good a customer as Major Hardee he ought to
remember that we aint all rich like him and

A general movement among all the club members interrupted him The
checker players left their boards and came over the sevenup devotees
dropped their cards and joined the circle

What was that you said asked Higgins uneasily The Major owin you
money was it

Oh course I know hes all right and a fine man and all that
protested Obed feeling himself put on the defensive But that aint
it Whats a feller goin to do when he needs the money and gets a
letter like that

He drew the crumpled sheet of note paper from his pocket and threw it
on the table Higgins picked it up and read it aloud as follows


SILVERLEAF HALL June 20th

MY DEAR MR GOTT I am in receipt of your courteous communication of
recent date I make it an unvarying rule to keep little ready money here
in East Harniss preferring rather to let it remain at interest in the
financial institutions of the cities Another rule of mine peculiar
I dare sayeven eccentric if you likeis never to pay by check I am
expecting remittances from my attorneys however and will then bear you
in mind Again thanking you for your courtesy and begging you to extend
to your sister my kindest regards I remain my dear sir

Yours very respectfully

CUTHBERTSON SCOTT HARDEE

P SI shall be delighted to have the pleasure of entertaining your
sister and yourself at dinner at the hall on any date agreeable to you
Kindly let me hear from you regarding this at your earliest convenience
I must insist upon this privilege so do not disappoint me I beg


The reception accorded this most gentlemanly epistle was peculiar Mr
Higgins laid it upon the table and put his hand into his own pocket So
did Ezra Weeks the butcher Caleb Small the dry goods dealer Hen
Leadbetter the livery stable keeper Bash Taylor the milkman and
three or four others And wonder of wonders each produced a sheet of
note paper exactly like Obeds

They spread them out on the table The dates were of course different
and they differed in other minor particulars but in the main they were
exactly alike And each one of them ended with an invitation to dinner

The members of the club looked at each other in amazement Higgins was
the first to speak

Godfrey mighty he exclaimed Say this is funny aint it Its
moren funny its queer By jimmy its moren thatits serious Look
here fellers is there anybody in this crowd that the Majors paid for
anything any time

They waited No one spoke Then with one impulse every face swung
about and looked up to where upon the wall hung the lifesize
photograph of the Major dignified gracious and giltframed It
had been presented to the club two months before by Cuthbertson Scott
Hardee himself

IkeIke Peters said Higgins Say Ikehas he ever paid you for
havin that took

Mr Peters who was the town photographer reddened hesitated and then
stammered Why no he aint yet

Humph grunted Higgins No one else said anything One or two took
out pocket memorandum books and went over some figures entered therein
Judging by their faces the results of these calculations were not
pleasing Obed was the first to break the painful silence

Well he exclaimed sarcastically aint nobody got nothin to say
If they aint I have Or at any rate Ive got somethin to do And
he rose and started to put on his coat

Hi hold on a minute Obed you loon cried Higgins Where are you
goin

Im goin to put my bill in Squire Bakers hands for clection and Im
goin to do it tonight too

He was on his way to the door but two or three ran to stop him

Dont be a fool Obed said Higgins Dont go off haf cocked Maybe
were gittin scared about nothin We dont know but well get every
cent thats owed us

Dont KNOW Well I aint goin to wait to find out What makes me
bilin is to think how weve set still and let a man that we never saw
afore last March and dont know one blessed thing about run up bills
and RUN em up How we come to be such everlastin fools I dont see
What did we let him have the stuff for Why didnt we make him pay I

Now see here Obed Gott broke in Weeks the butcher you know why
just as well as we do Why blast it he added earnestly if he was to
come into my shop tomorrow and tip that old high hat of his and smile
and say twas a fine mornin and Hows the good lady today and all
that hed get haf the meat there was in the place and I wouldnt say
Boo I jest couldnt thats all

This frank statement was received with approving nods and a chorus of
muttered Thats sos

It looks to me this way declared Higgins If the Majors all right
hes a mighty good customer for all of us If he aint all right weve
got to find it out but were in too deep to run resks of gettin him
mad fore we know for sure Lets think it over for a week Inside of
that time some of usll hint to him polite but firm you understand
that weve got to have something on account A week from tonight well
meet in the back room of my store talk it over and decide what to do
What do you say

Everybody but Obed agreed He declared that he had lost money enough
and wasnt going to be a fool any longer The others argued with him
patiently for a while and then Leadbetter the livery stable keeper
said sharply

See here Obe You aint the only one in this How much does the Major
owe you

Pretty nigh twenty dollars

Humph Youre lucky He owes me over thirty and I guess Higgins is
worse off than any of us Aint that so Beriah

About seventy even money answered the grocer shortly No use
Obed weve got to hang together Wait a week and then see And
fellers he added dont tell a soul about this business specially
the women folks There aint a woman nor girl in this town that dont
think Major Hardees an A1 goldplated saint and twouldnt be safe to
break the spell on a guess

Obed reached home even more disgruntled than when he left it He sat up
until after twelve thinking and smoking and when he went to bed he had
a brilliant idea The next morning he wrote a letter and posted it




CHAPTER V

A BABY AND A ROBBERY


The morning train for Boston at that season of the year reached East
Harniss at five minutes to six an ungodly hour according to the
irascible Mr Ogden Williams who in company with some of his wealthy
friends the summer residents was petitioning the railroad company for
a change in the timetable When Captain Sol Berry the depot master
walked briskly down Main Street the morning following Mr Gotts
eventful evening at the club the hands of the clock on the Methodist
church tower indicated that the time was twenty minutes to six

Issy McKay was already at the depot the doors of which were open
Captain Sol entered the waiting room and unlocked the ticket rack and
the little safe Issy languidly toying with the broom on the front
platform paused in his pretense of sweeping and awaited permission to
go home for breakfast It came in characteristic fashion

Hows the salt air affectin your appetite Is asked the Captain
casually

Issy who being intensely serious by nature was uneasy when he
suspected the presence of a joke confusedly stammered that he callated
his appetite was all right

Payin for the Majors glass aint kept you awake worryin has it

Noo sir I

Praps you thought he was the one to do the worryin hey

II dont know

Well whats your folks goin to have to eat this mornin

Issy admitted his belief that fried clams were to be the breakfast

So Clams Is did you ever read the soap advertisement about not bein
a clam

II dont knows I ever did No sir

All right I only called your attention to it as a warnin thats all
When anybody eats as many clams as you do theres a fair chance of his
turnin into one Now clear out and dont stay so long at breakfast
that you cant get back in time for dinner Trot

Issy trotted The depot master seated himself by the door of the ticket
office and fell into a reverie It was interrupted by the entrance of
Hiram Baker Captain Hiram was an exfishing skipper fiftyfive years
of age who with his wife Sophronia and their infant son Hiram Joash
Baker lived in a small oldfashioned house at the other end of the
village near the shore Captain Hiram having retired from the sea got
his living such as it was from his string of fish traps or weirs

The depot master hailed the new arrival heartily

Hello there Hiram he cried rising from his chair Glad to see you
once in a while Aint goin to leave us are you Not goin abroad for
your health or anything of that kind hey

Captain Baker laughed

No he answered No further abroad than Hyannis And Ill be back
from there tonight if the Lords willin and the cars dont get off the
track Give me a round trip ticket will you Sol

The depot master retired to the office returning with the desired
ticket Captain Hiram counted out the price from a confused mass of
coppers and silver emptied into his hand from a blackened leather
purse tied with a string

Hows Sophrony asked the depot master Pretty smart I hope

Yup shes smart Has to be to keep up with the rest of the
familyspecially the youngest

He chuckled His friend laughed in sympathy

The youngest is the most important of all I spose he observed How
IS the junior partner of H Baker and Son

He aint a silent partner Ill swear to that Honest Sol I blieve
my Dusenberry is the cutest young one outside of a show I said so
only yesterday to Mr Hilton the minister I did and I meant it

Well were all gettin ready to celebrate his birthday Ho ho

This was a standard joke and was so recognized and honored A baby born
on the Fourth of July is sure of a national celebration of his birthday
And to Captain Baker and his wife no celebration however widespread
could do justice to the importance of the occasion When to answer the
heart longings of the childloving couple married many years the baby
came he was accepted as a special dispensation of Providence and valued
accordingly

Hes got a real nice voice Hiram said Sophronia gazing proudly
at the prodigy who clutched gingerly in his fathers big hands was
screaming his little red face black I shouldnt wonder if he grew up
to sing in the choir

Thats the kind of voice to make a fomast hand step lively declared
Hiram Youll see this boy on the quarter deck of a clipper one of
these days

Naming him was a portentous proceeding and one not to be lightly gone
about Sophronia who was a Methodist by descent and early confirmation
was of the opinion that the child should have a Bible name

The Captain respected his wifes wishes but put in an ardent plea for
his own name Hiram

Theres been a Hiram Baker in our family ever since Noah histed
the mainryal on the ark he declared Id kinder like to keep the
procession agoin

They compromised by agreeing to make the babys Christian name Hiram and
to add a middle name selected at random from the Scriptures The big
rickety family Bible was taken from the center table and opened with
shaking fingers by Mrs Baker She read aloud the first sentence that
met her eye The son of Joash

Joash sneered her husband You aint goin to cruelize him with that
name be you

Hiram Baker do you dare to fly in the face of Scriptur

All right Have it your own way Go to sleep now Hiram Joash while I
sing Storm along John to you

Little Hiram Joash punched the ministers face with his fat fist when he
was christened to the great scandal of his mother and the illconcealed
delight of his father

Cant blame the child none declared the Captain Id punch anybody
that christened a middle name like that onto me

But in spite of his name the baby grew and prospered He fell out of
his crib of course the moment that he was able and barked his shins
over the big shells by the whatnot in the parlor the first time that
he essayed to creep He teethed with more or less tribulation and once
upset the household by an attack of the croup

They gave up calling him by his first name because of the Captains
invariably answering when the baby was wanted and not answering when he
himself was wanted Sophronia would have liked to call him Joash but
her husband wouldnt hear of it At length the father took to calling
him Dusenberry and this nickname was adopted under protest

Captain Hiram sang the baby to sleep every night There were three songs
in the Captains repertoire The first was a chanty with a chorus of

 John storm along storm along John
 Aint I glad my days works done

The second was the Bowline Song

 Haul on the bowline the Phrony is arollin
 Haul on the bowline the bowline HAUL

At the haul the Captains foot would come down with a thump Almost
the first word little Hiram Joash learned was haul He used to shout
it and kick his father vigorously in the vest

These were fairweather songs Captain Hiram sang them when everything
was going smoothly The Bowline Song indicated that he was feeling
particularly jubilant He had another that he sang when he was worried
It was a lugubrious ditty with a refrain beginning

 Oh sailor boy sailor boy neath the wild billow
 Thy grave is yawnin and waitin for thee

He sang this during the worst of the teething period and later when
the junior partner wrestled with the whooping cough You could always
tell the state of the babys health by the Captains choice of songs

Meanwhile Dusenberry grew and prospered He learned to walk and to talk
after his own peculiar fashion and at the mature age of two years and
six months formally shipped as first mate aboard his fathers dory His
duties in this responsible position were to sit in the stern securely
fastened by a strap while the Captain and his two assistants rowed out
over the bar to haul the nets of the deep water fish weir

The first mate gave the orders All hands on deck Tand by to det ship
under way There was no sogerin aboard the Hiram Juniorthat was
the dorys namewhile the first officer had command

Captain Hiram always ready to talk of the wonderful baby told the
depot master of the youngsters latest achievement which was to get the
cover off the butter firkin in the pantry and cover himself with butter
from head to heel

Ho ho ho he roared delightedly when Sophrony caught him at it
what do you spose he said Said he was playin he was a slice of bread
and was spreadin himself Haw haw

Captain Sol laughed in sympathy

But he didnt mean no harm by it explained the proud father Hes
got the tenderest little heart in the world When he found his ma felt
bad he bust out cryin and said hed scrape it all off again and when it
come prayer time hed tell God who did it so Hed know twant mother
that wasted the nice butter What do you think of that

No use talkin Hiram said the depot master thats the kind of boy
to have

You bet you Hello heres the train On time for a wonder See you
later Sol You take my advice get married and have a boy of your own
Nothin like one for solid comfort

The train was coming and they went out to meet it The only passenger
to alight was Mr Barzilla Wingate whose arrival had been foretold
by Bailey Stitt the previous evening Barzilla was part owner of a
goodsized summer hotel at Wellmouth Neck He and the depot master were
old friends

After the train had gone Wingate and Captain Sol entered the station
together The Captain had insisted that his friend come home with him to
breakfast instead of going to the hotel After some persuasion Barzilla
agreed So they sat down to await Issys arrival The depot master could
not leave the station until the assistant arrived

Well Barzilla asked Captain Sol whats the newest craze over to
the hotel

The newest said Wingate with a grin is automobiles

Automobiles Why I thought twas baseball

Baseball was last summer We had a championship team then Yes sir we
won out though for a spell it looked pretty dubious But baseballs an
old story Weve had football since and now

Wait a minute Football Why now I do remember You had a football
team there andand want there somethin queer some sort of aa
robbery or stealin or swindlin connected with it Seemss if Id
heard somethin like that

Mr Wingate looked his friend over winked and asked a question

Sol he said you aint forgot how to keep a secret

The depot master smiled I guess not he said

Well then Im goin to trust you with one Im goin to tell you the
whole business about that robbin Its all mixed up with football and
millionaires and thingsand its a dead secret the truth of it So
when I tell you it mustnt go no further

You see he went on it was late into August when Peter T was took
down with the inspiration Not that there was anything specially new
in his bein took He was subject to them seizures Peter was and every
time they broke out in a fresh place The Old Home House itself was one
of his inspirations so was the hirin of college waiters the openin
of the two Annex cottages the South Shore Weather Bureau and a whole
lot more Sometimes as in the weatherbureau foolishness the disease
left him and tother two patientsmeanin me and Capn Jonadabpretty
weak in the courage and wasted in the pocketbook but genrally they
turned out good and our systems and bank accounts was more healthy than
normal One of Peter Ts inspirations was considerble like typhoid
feverif you did get over it you felt better for havin had it

This time the attack was in the shape of a supplementary season
Twas Peters idea that shuttin up the Old Home the fust week in
September was altogether too soon

Whats the use of quittin says he while theres bait left and the
fish are bitin Why not keep her goin through September and October
Two or three adsMY adsin the papers hintin that the ducks and wild
geese are beginnin to keep the boarders awake by roostin in the
back yard and hollerin at nighttwo or three of them and well have
gunners here by the regiment Other summer hotels do it the Wapatomac
House and the rest so why not us It hurts my conscience to see good
money gettin past the door count of the Not at Home sign hung on the
knob What dyou say partners says he

Well we had considerble to say particlar Capn Jonadab Twas
too risky and too expensive Gunnin was all right except for one
thingthat is that there want none wuth mentionin

Ducks are scurser round here than Democrats in a Vermont
townmeetin growled the Capn And as for geese How long has it
been since you see a goose Barzilla

Land knows says I I can remember as fur back as the fust time
Washy Sparrow left off workin but I cant

Brown told us to shut up Did we callate he didnt know what he was
talkin about

I can see two geese right now he snaps but theyre so old and
leatherheaded you couldnt shoot an idea into their brains with a
cannon Gunnin aint the whole thing My makin a noise like a duck is
only to get the wouldbe Teddy Roosevelts headed for this neck of the
woods After they get here its up to us to keep em And I can think
of as many ways to do that as the Capn can of savin a quarter Our
baseball teams been a success aint it Sure thing Then why not a
football team Parker says hell get it together and coach and capn
it too And Robinson and his daughter have agreed to stay till October
fifteenth So theres a start anyhow

Twas a start and a pretty good one The Robinsons had come to the Old
Home about the fust of August and they was our star boarders G W
Robinson was the old mans name as entered on the hotel log and his
daughter answered to the hail of Gracethat is when she took
a notion to answer at all The Robinsons was what Peter T called
exclusive They didnt mix much with the rest of the bunch but
kept to themselves in their rooms particlar when a fresh net full of
boarders was hauled aboard Then they seemed to take an observation of
every arrival afore they mingled questioned the pedigree and statistics
of all hands and acted mighty suspicious

The only thing that really stirred Papa Robinson up and got him excited
and friendly was baseball and boat racin He was an old sport that was
plain the only real plain thing about him the rest was mystery As
for Grace she want plain by a good sight bein what Brown called
a peach She could have had every single male in tow if shed wanted
em Apparently she didnt want em preferrin to be lonesome and sad
and interestin Yes sir there was a mystery about them Robinsons and
even Peter T give in to that

If twas anybody else says he Id say the old man was a crook
down here hidin from the police But hes too rich for that and always
has been He aint any flybynight I can tell the real article without
lookin for the sterlin mark on the handle But Ill bet all the
coldstorage eggs in the hotel against the henyardand thats big
oddsthat he want christened Robinson And his face is familiar to
me Ive seen it somewhere either in print or in person I wish I knew
where

So if the Robinsons had agreed to staythem and their two
servantsthat was a big help as Brown said And Parker would help
too though we agreed there want no mystery about him He was a big
broadshouldered young feller just out of college somewheres who had
drifted our way the fortnit after the Robinsons came with a reputation
for athletics and a leanin toward cigarettes and Miss Grace She leaned
a little too but hers want so much of a bend as his was He was dead
gone on her and if shed have decided to stay under water hed
have ducked likewise Twas easy enough to see why HE believed in a
supplementary season

Me and Jonadab argued it out with Peter and finally we met halfway
sos to speak We wouldnt keep the whole shebang open but wed shut
up everything but one Annex cottage and advertise that as a Gunners
Retreat So we done it

And it worked Heavens to Betsyyes It worked so well that by the
second week in September we had to open tother Annex The gunnin was
bad but Peters ads fetched the wouldbes and his excursions and
picnics and the football team held em The football team especial
Parker capned that and from the gunnin crew and the waiters and some
fishermen in the village he dug up an eleven that showed symptoms of
playin the game We played the Trumet High School and beat it thanks
to Parker and that tickled Pa Robinson so that he bought a twohandled
silver soup tureenlovin cup he called itand agreed to give it to
the team round about that won the most of the series So the series was
arranged the Old Home House crowd and the Wapatomac House eleven and
three highschool gangs bein in it And twas practice practice
practice from then on

When we opened the second Annex the question of help got serious Most
of our college waiters had gone back to school and we was pretty shy
of servants So we put some extry advertisin in the Cape weeklies and
trusted in Providence

The evenin followin the ad in the weeklies I was settin smokin on
the back piazza of the shutup main hotel when I heard the gate click
and somebody crunchin along the clamshell path I sung out Ahoy
there and the cruncher whoever he was come my way Then I made out
that he was a tall young chap with his hands in his pockets

Good evenin says he Is this Mr Brown

Thankin you for the compliment it aint I says My names
Wingate

Oh says he Is that so Ive heard father speak of you Mr
Wingate He is Solomon Bearse of West Ostable I think you know him
slightly

Know him Everybody on the Cape knows Sol Bearse by reputation
anyhow Hes the richest meanest old cranberry grower and
coastinfleet owner in these parts

Is Sol Bearse your dad I asks astonished Why then you must be
Gus

No he says Im the other oneFred

Oh the college one The one whos goin to be a lawyer

Well yesand no says he I WAS the college one as you call it
but Im not goin to be a lawyer Father and I have had some talk on
that subject and I think weve settled it Iwell just at present
Im not sure what Im goin to be Thats what Ive come to you for I
saw your ad in the Item andI want a job

I was set all aback and left with my canvas flappin as you might
say Sol Bearses boy huntin a job in a hotel kitchen Soons I could
fetch a whole breath I wanted particlars He give em to me

Seems hed been sent out to one of the colleges in the Middle West by
his dad who was dead set on havin a lawyer in the family But the more
he studied the less he hankered for law What he wanted to be was a
literaturea bookagent or a poet or some such foolishness Old Sol
havin no more use for a poet than he had for a poor relation was red
hot in a minute Was this what hed been droppin good money in the
education collection box for Was thisetcetery and so on Hed
bewhat the church folks say he will beif Fred dont go in for law
Fred he comes back that hell be the same if he does So they disowned
each other by mutual consent as the Irishman said and the boy marches
out of the front door bag and baggage And as the poetry market seemed
to be sort of overly supplied at the present time he decided he must
do somethin to earn a dollar and seein our ad he comes to Wellmouth
Port and the Old Home

But look here says I we aint got no job for a literary We need
fellers to pass pie and wash dishes And THAT aint no poem

Well he thought perhaps he could help make up advertisin

You cant I told him One time when Peter T Brown was away me
and Capn Jonadab callated that a poetry advertisement would be a good
idee and we managed to shake out ten lines or so It begun

 When youre feelin tired and pale
 To the Old Home House you ought to come without fail

We thought twas pretty slick but we never got but one answer and
that was a circular from one of them correspondence schools of authors
sayin theyd let us in on a course at cut rates And the next thing we
knew we see that poem in the joke page of a Boston paper I never

He laughed quiet and sorrowful He had the quietest way of speakin
anyhow and his voice was a lovely tenor To hear it purrin out of his
big tall body was as unexpected as a hymn tune in a centintheslot
talkin machine

Too bad he says As a waiter Im afraid

Just then the door of one of the Annex houses opened sudden and there
stood Grace Robinson The light behind her showed her up plain as could
be I heard Fred Bearse make a kind of gaspin noise in his throat

What a lovely night she says half to herself Then she calls
Papa dear you really ought to see the stars

Old man Robinson who I judged was in the settin room snarled out
somethin which want no compliment to the stars Then he ordered
her to come in afore she catched cold She sighed and obeyed orders
shuttin the door astern of her Next thing I knew that literary tenor
grabbed my armtwant no canarybird grip neither

Who was that he whispers eager

I told him Thats the name they give says I but we have doubts
about its bein the real one You see theres some mystery about them
Robinsons and

Ill take that waiters place he says quick Shall I go right in
and begin now Dont stop to argue man I say Ill take it

And he did take it by main strength pretty nigh Every time Id open
my mouth hed shut it up and at last I give in and showed him where he
could sleep

You turn out at five sharp I told him And you neednt bother to
write no poems while youre dressin neither

Good night he answers brisk Go will you please I want to
think

I went Taint until an hour later that I remembered he hadnt asked
one word concernin the wages And next mornin he comes to me and
suggests that perhaps twould be as well if I didnt tell his real name
He was pretty sure hed been away schoolin so long that he wouldnt be
recognized And incognitos seem to be fashionable here he purrs soft
and gentle

I wouldnt know an incognito if I stepped on one but the tenor voice
of him kind of made me sick

All right I snaps sarcastic Suppose I call you Willie Howll
that do

Do as well as anything I guess he says Didnt make no odds to him
If Id have called him Maud hed have been satisfied

He waited in Annex Number Two which was skippered by Capn Jonadab
And for a poet he done pretty well so the Capn said

But say Barzilla asks Jonadab does that Willie thing know the
Robinsons

Guess not I says But thinkin of the way hed acted when the girl
come to the door Why

Oh nothin much Only when he come in with the doughnuts the fust
mornin at breakfast I thought Grace sort of jumped and looked funny
Anyhow she didnt eat nothin after that Praps that was on account
of her bein out sailin the day afore though

I said I callated that was it but all the same I was interested
And when a day or so later I see Grace and Willie talkin together
earnest out back of the kitchen I was more so But I never said
nothin Ive been seafarin long enough to know when to keep my main
hatch closed

The supplementary season dragged along but it want quite the success
it looked like at the start The gunnin that year was even worse than
usual and excursions and picnics in late September aint all joy by
no manner of means We shut up the second Annex at the end of the month
and transferred the help to Number One Precious few new boarders come
and a good many of the old ones quit Them that did stay stayed on
account of the football We was edgin up toward the end of the series
and our team and the Wapatomac crowd was neck and neck It looked as if
the final game between them and us over on their grounds would settle
whod have the soup tureen

Pa Robinson and Parker had been quite interested in Willie when he
fust come They thought he might play with the eleven you see But he
wouldnt Set his foot right down

I dont care for athletics he says mild but firm They used to
interest me somewhat but not now

The old man was crazy Hed heard about Willies literature leanins
and he give out that hed never see a writer yet that want a sissy
Wanted us to fire Bearse right off but we kept him thanks to me If
hed seen the sissy kick the ball once same as I did it might have
changed his mind some He was passin along the end of the field when
the gang was practicin and the ball come his way He caught it on the
fly and sent it back with his toe It went a mile seemed so whirlin
and whizzin Willie never even looked to see where it went just kept
on his course for the kitchen

The big sensation hit us on the fifth of October right after supper
Me and Peter T and Jonadab was in the office when down comes Henry
old Robinsons man servant white as a sheet and wringin his hands
distracted

Oh I say Mr Brown says he shakin all over like a quicksand
Oh Mr Brown sir Will you come right up to Mr SterzI mean Mr
Robinsons room please sir E wants to see you gentlemen special
Urry please Urry

So we urried wonderin what on earth was the matter And when we
got to the Robinson rooms there was Grace lookin awful pale and the
old man himself ragin up and down like a horse mackrel in a fish weir

Soon as papa sees us he jumped up in the air sos to speak and when
he lit twas right on our necks His daughter who seemed to be the
sanest one in the lot run and shut the door

Look here you raved the old gent shakin both fists under Peter
Ts nose Didnt you tell me this was a respectable hotel And aint
we payin for respectability

Peter admitted it bein too much set back to argue I callate

Yes rages Robinson We pay enough for all the respectability in
this state And yet by the livin Moses I cant go out of my room
to spoil my digestion with your cussed driedapple pie but what Im
robbed

Robbed the three of us gurgles in chorus

Yes sir Robbed Robbed ROBBED What do you think I came here for
And why do I stay here all this time Cause I LIKE it Cause I cant
afford a better place No sir By the great horn spoon I come here
because I thought in this forsaken hole I could get lost and be safe
And now

He tore around like a water spout Grace trying to calm him and
Henry and Suzette the maid groanin and sobbin accompaniments in the
corner I looked at the dresser There was silverbacked brushes and all
sorts of expensive doodads spread out loose and Miss Robinsons watch
and a dimond ring and a few other knickknacks I couldnt imagine a
thiefs leavin all that truck and I said so

Them sputters Pa frantic What the brimstone blazes do you think
I care for them I could buy that sort of stuff by the carload if I
wanted to But whats been stole isOh get out and leave me alone
Youre no good the lot of you

Father has had a valuable paper stolen from him explains Grace A
very valuable paper

Valuable howls her dad VALUABLE Why if Gordon and his gang get
that paper theyve got ME thats all Their suits as good as won and
I know it And to think that Ive kept it safe up to within a month
of the trial and nowGrace Sterzer you stop pattin my head Im no
pussycat By the And so on indefinite

When he called his daughter Sterzer instead of Robinson I callated
he was loony sure enough But Peter T slapped his leg

Oh he says as if hed seen a light all to once Ah NOW I begin
to get wise I knew your face wasSee here Mr SterzerMr Gabriel
Sterzerdont you think wed better have a real plain talk on this
matter Lets get down to tacks Was the paper you lost something to do
with the SterzerGordon lawsuit The Aluminum Trust case you know

The old man stopped dancin stared at him hard and then set down and
wiped his forehead

Something to DO with it he groans Why you idiot it was IT
If Gordons lawyers get that paperand theyve been after it for a
yearthen the fats all in the fire Theres nothin left for me to do
but compromise

When Peter T mentioned the name of Gabriel Sterzer me and Jonadab
begun to see a light too Course you remember the bustup of the
Aluminum Trusteverybody does The papers was full of it Thered
been a row among the two leadin stockholders Gabe Sterzer and Major
Gordon Them two doublebackaction millionaires practically owned the
trust and the state twas in and the politics of that state and all
the politicians Each of em run three or four banks of their own and
a couple of newspapers and other things till you couldnt rest Then
they had the row and Gabe had took his playthings and gone home as
you might say Among the playthings was a majority of the stock and the
Major had sued for it The suit with pictures of the leadin
characters and the lawyers and all had been spreadeagled in the papers
everywheres No wonder Robinsons face was familiar

But it seemed that Sterzer had held the trump card in the shape of the
original agreement between him and Gordon And he hung on to it like
the Old Scratch to a fiddler Gordon and his crowd had done everything
short of murder to get it hired folks to steal it and so on because
once they DID get it Gabe hadnt a leg to stand onhed have to divide
equal which want his desires by a good sight The Sterzer lawyers
had wanted him to leave it in their charge but nohe knew too much for
that The pigheaded old fool had carted it with him wherever he went
and him and his daughter had come to the Old Home House because he
figgered nobody would think of their bein in such an outoftheway
place as that But they HAD thought of it Anyhow the paper was gone

But Mr RobinzerSterson I mean cut in Capn Jonadab you could
have em took up for stealin couldnt you They wouldnt dare

Course theyd dare Spose they dont know I wouldnt have that
agreement get in the papers Dare Theyd dare anything If they get
away with it by hook or crook all I can do is haul in my horns and
compromise If theyve got that paper the suit never comes to trial

Well they aint got it yet says Peter decided Whoever stole the
thing is right here in this boardinhouse and its up to us to see
that they stay here Barzilla you take care of the mail No letters
must go out tonight Jonadab you set up and watch all hands help and
all Nobody must leave this place if we have to tie em And Ill keep a
genral overseein of the whole thing till we get a detective Andif
youll stand the waybill Mr Sterzerwell have the best Pinkerton in
Boston down here in three hours by special train By the way are you
sure the thing IS lifted Where was it

Old Gabe kind of colored up and give in that twas under his pillow
He always kept it there after the beds was made

Humph grunts Brown Why didnt you hang it on the doorknob Under
the pillow If I was a sneak thief the first place Id look would be
under the pillow after that Id tackle the jewelry box and the safe

There was considerble more talk Seems the Sterzers had left Henry on
guard same as they always done when they went to supper They could
trust him and Suzette absolute they said But Henry had gone down
the hall after a drink of water and when he had got back everything
apparently was all right Twant till Gabe himself come up that he
found the paper gone I judged hed made it interestin for Henry the
poor critter looked that way

All hands agreed to keep mum for the present and to watch Peter
hustled to the office and called up the Pinkertons over the long
distance

Mr Wingate paused Captain Sol was impatient

Go on he said Dont stop now Im gettin anxious

Barzilla rose to his feet Heres your McKay man back again he said
Lets go up to your house and have breakfast We can talk while were
eatin Im empty as a poorhouse boarders pocketbook




CHAPTER VI

AVIATION AND AVARICE


Breakfast at Capt Sol Berrys was a bountiful meal The depot master
employed a middleaged woman who came in each day cooked his meals and
did the housework returning to her own home at night After Mr Wingate
had mowed a clean swath through ham and eggs cornbread and coffee
and had reached the cooky and doughnut stage he condescended to speak
further concerning the stolen paper

Well he said Brown give me and Jonadab a serious talkin to when he
got us alone

Now fellers he says we know what weve got to do Nothinll be
too good for this shebang and us if we get that agreement back Fust
place the thing was done a few minutes after the supperbell rung
That is unless that Enry is in on the deal which aint unlikely
considerin the price he could get from the Gordon gang Was anybody
late at the tables

Why yes there were quite a few late Two of the gunners whod been
on a forlornhope duck hunt and a minister and his wife out walkin
for their health and Parker and two fellers from the football team
whod been practicin

Any of the waiters or the chambermaids asked Peter

Id been expectin hed ask that and I hated to answer

One of the waiters was a little late says I Willie want on hand
immediate Said he went to wash his hands

Now the help genrally washed in the focastlethe servants
quarters I meanbut there was a wash room on the floor where the
SterzerRobinsons roomed Peter looked at Jonadab and the two of em at
me And I had to own up that Willie had come downstairs from that wash
room a few minutes after the bell rung

Hum says Peter T Hum he says Look here Barzilla didnt you
tell me you knew that fellers real name and that he had been studying
law

No says I emphatic I said twas law he was tryin to get away
from His tastes run large to literation and poetry

Hum says Peter again All papers are more or less literaryeven
trust agreements Hum

All the same says I Ill bet my Sunday beaver that HE never took
it

They didnt answer but looked solemn Then the three of us went on
watch

Nobody made a move to go out that evenin I kept whatever mail was
handed in but there was nothin that looked like any agreements
and nothin addressed to Gordon or his lawyers At twelve or so the
detective come Peter drove up to the depot to meet the special He told
the whole yarn on the way down

The detective was a nice enough chap and we agreed he should be Mr
Snow of New York gunnin for health and ducks He said the watch must
be kept up all night and in the mornin hed make his fust move So
said so done

And afore breakfast that next mornin we called everybody into the
dinin room boarders help stable hands every last one And Peter
made a little speech He said that a very valuable paper had been taken
out of Mr Robinsons room and twas plain that it must be on the
premises somewhere Course nobody was suspicioned but speakin
for himself hed feel better if his clothes and his room was searched
through Howd the rest feel about it

Well they felt diffrent ways but Parker spoke up like a brick and
said he wouldnt rest easy till HIS belongins was pawed over and then
the rest fell in line We went through everybody and every room on the
place Found nothin of course Snowthe detectivesaid he didnt
expect to But I tell you there was some talkin goin on just the
same The minister he hinted that he had some doubts about them
dissipated gunners and the gunners callated they never see a parson
yet wouldnt bear watchin As for me I felt like a pickpocket and
judgin from Jonadabs face he felt the same

The detective man swooped around quiet bobbin up in unexpected
places like a porpoise and askin questions once in a while He asked
about most everybody but about Willie especial I judged Peter T had
dropped a hint to him and to Gabe Anyhow the old critter give out
that he wouldnt trust a poet with the silver handles on his grandmarms
coffin As for Grace she acted dreadful nervous and worried Once I
caught her swabbin her eyes as if shed been cryin but Id never
seen her and Willie together but the one time I told you of

Four days and nights crawled by No symptoms yet The Pinkertons was
watchin the Gordon lawyers office in New York and they reported
that nothin like that agreement had reached there And our own
manSnowsaid hed go bail it hadnt been smuggled off the premises
sense HE struck port So twas safe so far but where was it and who
had it

The final football game the one with Wapatomac was to be played over
on their grounds on the afternoon of the fifth day Parker capn of the
eleven give out that considerin everything he didnt know but wed
better call it off Old RobinsonSterzer of coursewouldnt hear of
it

Not much says he I wouldnt chance your losin that game for forty
papers You sail in and lick em or words to that effect

So the eleven was to cruise across the bay in the Greased Lightnin
Peters little motor launch and the rooters was to go by train later
on Twas Parkers idee goin in the launch Twould be more quiet
less strain on the nerves of his men and they could talk over plays and
signals on the vyage

So at nine oclock in the forenoon they was ready the whole
teamthree waiters two fishermen one carpenter from up to Wellmouth
Center a stable hand and Parker and three reglar boarders These last
three was friends of Parkers that hed had come down some time afore
He knew they could play football he said and theyd come to oblige
him

The eleven gathered on the front porch all in togs and sweaters
principally provided and paid for by Sterzer Capn Parker had the ball
under his arm and the launch was waitin ready at the landin All the
boardersexcept Grace who was upstairs in her roomand most of the
help was standin round to say good luck and goodby

Snow the detective was there and I whispered in his ear

Say I says do you realize that for the fust time since the robbery
heres a lot of folks leavin the house How do you know but what

He winked and nodded brisk Ill attend to that he says

But he didnt have to Parker spoke fust and took the wind out of his
sails

Gentlemen says he I dont know how the rest of you feel but as
for me I dont start without clear skirts I suggest that Mr Brown and
Mr Wingate here search each one of us thoroughly Who knows says he
laughin but what Ive got that precious stolen paper tucked inside my
sweater Ha ha Come on fellers Ill be first

He tossed the ball into a chair and marched into the office the
rest of the players after him takin it as a big joke And there the
searchin was done and done thorough cause Peter asked Mr Snow to
help and he knew how One thing was sure Pa Gabes agreement want
hid about the persons of that football team Everybody laughedthat is
all but the old man and the detective Seemed to me that Snow was kind
of disappointed and I couldnt see why Twant likely any of THEM was
thieves

Capn Parker picked up his football and started off for the launch
Hed got about hafway to the shore when Williewhod been standin
with the rest of the help lookin onstepped forard pretty brisk and
whispered in the ear of the Pinkerton man The detective jumped sort
of and looked surprised and mighty interested

By George says he I never thought of that Then he run to the
edge of the piazza and called

Mr Parker he sings out Oh Mr Parker

Parker was at the top of the little rise that slopes away down to the
landin The rest of the eleven was scattered from the shore to the
hotel steps He turns without stoppin and answers

What is it he sings out kind of impatient

Theres just one thing we forgot to look at shouts Snow Merely a
matter of form but just bring thatHey Stop him Stop him

For Parker instead of comin back had turned and was leggin it for
the launch as fast as he could and that was some

Stop roars the Pinkerton man jumpin down the steps Stop or

Hold him Jim screeched Parker over his shoulder One of the
biggest men on the elevenone of the three friends whod been so
obligin as to come down on purpose to play footballmade a dive
caught the detective around the waist and threw him flat

Go on Ed he shouts Ive got him all right

Edmeanin Parkerwas goin on and goin fast All hands seemed
to be frozen stiff me and Jonadab and Peter T included As for me I
couldnt make head nor tail of the doins things was comin too quick
for MY understandin

But there was one on that piazza who want froze Fur from it Willie
the poet waiter made a jump swung his long legs over the porchrail
hit the ground and took after that Parker man like a cat after a field
mouse

Run I never see such runnin He fairly flashed across that lawn and
over the rise Parker was almost to the landin two more jumps and hed
been aboard the launch If hed once got aboard a turn of the switch
and that electric craft would have had him out of danger in a shake But
them two jumps was two too many Willie riz off the ground like a flyin
machine turned his feet up and his head down and lapped his arms
around Parkers knees Down the pair of em went Kerwallop and the
football flew out of Parkers arms

In an eyewink that poet was up grabs the ball and comes tearin back
toward us

Stop him shrieks Parker from astern

Head him off Tackle him bellers the big chap who was hangin onto
the detective

They tell me that discipline and obeyin orders is as much in football
as tis aboard ship If thats so every one of the Old Home House
eleven was onto their jobs There was five men between Willie and the
hotel and they all bore down on him like bats on a June bug

Get him howls Parker racin to help

Down him chimes in big Jim his knee in poor Snows back

Run Bearse Run whoops the Pinkerton man liftin his mouth out of
the sand

He rundont you worry about that Likewise he dodged One chap
swooped at him and he ducked under his arms Another made a dive and
he jumped over him The third one he pushed one side with his hand
Pushed did I say Knocked would be better for the fellerthe
carpenter twaswent over and over like a barrel rollin down hill But
there was two more left and one of em was bound to have him

Then a window upstairs banged open

Oh Mr Bearse screamed a voiceGrace Sterzers voice Dont let
them get you

We all heard her in spite of the shoutin and racket Willie heard
her too The two fellers one at each side was almost on him when
he stopped looked up jumped back and as cool as a rain barrel in
January he dropped that ball and kicked it

I can see that picture now like a tableau at a church sociable The
fellers that was runnin the others on the ground and that literary
pie passer with his foot swung up to his chin

And the ball It sailed up and up in a long curve began to drop
passed over the piazza roof and out of sight

Lock your door Miss Sterzer sung out Fred BearseWillie for
short Lock your door and keep that ball I think your fathers paper
is inside it

As sure as my name is Barzilla Wingate he had kicked that football
straight through the open window into old Gabes room

The depot master whooped and slapped his knee Mr Wingate grinned
delightedly and continued

There he went on the cats out of the bag and there aint much
more to tell Everybody made a bolt for the room old Gabe and Peter
T in the lead Grace let her dad in and the ball was ripped open in a
hurry Sure enough Inside between the leather and the rubber was
the missin agreement Among the jubilations and praise services nobody
thought of much else until Snow the Pinkerton man come upstairs his
clothes tore and his eyes and nose full of sand

Humph says he Youve got it hey Good Well you havent got
friend Parker Look

Such of us as could looked out of the window There was the launch
with Parker and his three friends in it headin twoforty for blue
water

Let em go says old Gabe contented I wouldnt arrest em if I
could This is no policestation job

It come out afterwards that Parker was a young chap just from law
school who had gone to work for the firm of shysters who was attendin
to the Gordon interests They had tracked Sterzer to the Old Home House
and had put their new hand on the job of gettin that agreement Fust
hed tried to shine up to Grace but the shineher part of ithad wore
off Then he decided to steal it and he done it just how nobody knows
Snow the detective says he callates Henry the servant is wisern
most folks thinks furs thats concerned

Snow had found out about Parker inside of two days Soons he got the
report as to who he was he was morally sartin that he was the thief
Hed looked up Willies record too and that was clear In fact Willie
helped him considerble Twas him that recognized Parker havin seen
him play on a lawschool team Also twas Willie who thought of the
paper bein in the football

Land of love What a hero they made of that waiter

By the livin Moses bubbles old Gabe shakin both the boys hands
That was the finest run and tackle and the finest kick I ever saw
anywhere Ive seen every big game for ten years and I never saw
anything half so good

The Pinkerton man laughed Theres only one chap on earth who can kick
like that Here he is layin his hand on Willies shoulder Bearse
the AllAmerican halfback last year

Gabes mouth fell open Not Bung Bearse of Yarvard he sings out
Why WHY

Of course father purrs his daughter smilin and happy I knew
him at once He and I wereerslightly acquainted when I was at
Highcliffe

Butbut Bung Bearse gasps the old gent Why you rascal I saw
you kick the goal that beat Haleton Your reputation is worldwide

WillieFred Bearse that isshook his head sad and regretful

Thank you Mr Sterzer says he in his gentle tenor I have no
desire to be famous in athletics My aspirations now are entirely
literary

Well hes got his literary job at last bein engaged as sportin
editor on one of Gabes papers His dad old Sol Bearse seems to be
pretty well satisfied particlar as another engagement between the
Bearse family and the Sterzers has just been given out

Barzilla helped himself to another doughnut His host leaned back in his
chair and laughed uproariously

Well by the great and mighty he exclaimed that Willie chap
certainly did fool you didnt he You cant always tell about these
college critters Sometimes they break out unexpected like chickenpox
in the Old Mens Home Ha ha Say do you know Nate Scudder

Know him Course I know him The meanest man on the Cape and livin
right in my own town too Well if I didnt know him I might trust him
and that would be the beginnin of the endfor me

It sartin would But what made me think of him was what he told
me about his nephew who was a college chap considerble like your
Willie I jedge Nate and this nephew Augustus Tolliver was mixed up
in that flyinmachine business you remember

I know they was Mixed up with that Professor Dixland the papers are
makin such a fuss over Wellmouths been crazy over it all but it
happened a year ago and nobody that I know of has got the straight
inside facts about it yet Nate wont talk at all Whenever you ask him
he busts out swearin and walks off His wifes got such a temper that
nobody dared ask her except the minister He tried it and aint been
the same man since

Well the depot master smilingly scratched his chin I callate Ive
got those inside facts

You HAVE

Yes Nate gave em to me under protest You see I know Nate pretty
well I know some things about him that    but never mind that part
I asked him and at last he told me Ill have to tell you in his
words cause half the fun was the way he told it and the way he looked
at the whole business So you can imagine Im Nate and

Twill be a big strain on my imagination to blieve youre Nate
Scudder Sol Berry

Thanks However youll have to do it for a spell Well Nate said that
it really begun when the Professor and Olivia landed at the Wellmouth
depot with the freight car full of junk Of course the actual
beginnin was further back than that when that Harmon man come on from
Philadelphy and hunted him up makin proclamation that a friend of
his a Mr Van Brunt of New York had said that Scudder had a nice quiet
island to let and maybe he could hire it

Course Nate had an islandthat little sundried sandbank a mile or
so off shore abreast his house which we used to call Horsefoot Bar
That crazy Van Brunt and his chum Hartley who lived there along
with Sol Pratt a year or so ago rechristened it Ozone Island you
remember Nate was willin to let it Hed let Tophet if he owned it
and a fool come along who wanted to hire it and could pay for the rent
and heat

So Nate and this Harmon feller rowed over to the Barto Ozone Island
I meanand the desolation and loneliness of it seemed to suit him to
perfection So did the old house and big barn and all the tumbledown
buildins stuck there in the beachgrass and sand Afore theyd left
they made a dicker He want the principal in it He was the private
secretary and fust mate of Mr Professor Ansel Hobart Dixland the
scientistperhaps Scudderd heard of him

Perhaps he had but if so Nate forgot it though he didnt tell him
that Harmon ordered a fifteenfoothigh board fence built all around
the house and barn and made Nate swear not to tell a soul who was
comin nor anything Dixland might want the island two months he said
or he might want it two years Nate didnt care He was in for good
pickins and begun to pick by slicin a liberal commission off that
fencebuildin job There was a whole passel of letters back and forth
between Nate and Harmon and finally Nate got word to meet the victims
at the depot

There was the professor himself an old driedup relic with whiskers
and a temper and there was Miss Olivia Dixland his niece and
housekeeper a slim plain lookin girl who wore eyeglasses and a
straight up and down dress And there was a freight car full of crates
and boxes and land knows what all But nary sign was there of a private
secretary and assistant The professor told Nate that Mr Harmons
health had suddenly broke down and hed had to be sent South

Its a calamity says he a real calamity Harmon has been with
me in my work from the beginnin and now just as it is approachin
completion he is taken away They say he may die It is very annoyin

Humph says Nate Well maybe it annoys HIM some too you cant
tell What you goin to do for a secretary

I understand says the professor that there is a person of
considerble scientific attainment residin with you Mr Scudder at
present Harmon met him while he was here they were in the same class
at college Harmon recommended him highly Olivia he says to the
niece what was the name of the young man whom Harmon recommended

Tolliver Uncle Ansel answers the girl lookin kind of disdainful
at Nate Somehow he had the notion that she didnt take to him fust
rate

Hey sings out Nate Tolliver Why thats Augustus AUGUSTUS well
Ill be switched

Augustus Tolliver was Nates nephew from up Boston way Him and Nate
was livin together at that time Huldy Ann Mrs Scudder was out West
in Omaha takin care of a cousin of hers who was a chronic invalid and
whats more to the purpose owned a lot of stock in copper mines

Augustus was a frecklefaced spindleshanked little critter with
spectacles and a soft polite way of speakin that made you want to
build a fire under him to see if he could swear like a Christian He
had a big head with considerble hair on the top of it and nothin
underneath but what he called science and sociology His science
want nothin but tommyrot to Nate and the sociology was some kind
of drivel about everybody bein equal to everybody else or better
Seemed to think twas wrong to get a good price for a thing when you
found a feller soft enough to pay it Did you ever hear the beat of that
in your life says Nate

However Augustus had soaked so much science and sociology into that
weak noddle of his that they kind of made him drunk as you might say
and the doctor had sent him down to board with the Scudders and sleep it
off Nervous prostration was the way he had his symptoms labeled and
the nerve part was all right for if a hen flew at him hed holler and
run Scart you never see such a scart cat in your born days Scart of a
boat scart of being seasick scart of a gun scart of everything Most
special he was scart of Uncle Nate The said uncle kept him that way
sos he wouldnt dast to kick at the grub him and Huldy Ann give him I
guess

Augustus Tolliver says old Dixland noddin Yes that is the name
Has he had a sound scientific trainin

Scientific trainin says Nate Scientific trainin Why you bet
hes had it Thats the only kind of trainin he HAS had Hell be just
the feller for you Mr Dixland

So that was settled all but notifyin Augustus But Scudder sighted
another speculation in the offin and hove alongside of it

Mr Harmon when he was here says he he mentioned you needin
a nice dependable man to live on the island and be sort of general
roustabout My wife bein away just now and all it struck me that I
might as well be that man Maybe my termsll seem a little high at fust
mention but

Very good says the professor very good Im sure youll be
satisfactory Now please see to the unloading of that car And be
careful VERY careful

Nate broke the news to Augustus that afternoon He had his nose stuck
in a book as usual and never heard so Nate yelled at him like a mate
on a tramp steamer just to keep in trainin

Who Who Who What What squeals Augustus jumpin out of the
chair as if there was pins in it What is it Who did it Oh my poor
nerves

Drat your poor nerves Nate says Ive got a good promisin job for
you Listen to this

Then he told about the professors wantin Gus to be assistant and help
do what the old man called experiments

Dixland says Gus Ansel Hobart Dixland the great scientist And
Im to be HIS assistant Assistant to the man who discovered DIXIUM and
invented

Oh belay there snorts Nate impatient Tell me thishes awful
rich aint he

Why I believeyes Harmon said he was But to think of MY bein

Now nephew Nate cut in let me talk to you a minute Me and your
Aunt Huldy Ann have been mighty kind to you sence youve been here and
heres your chance to do us a good turn You stick close to science and
the professor and let me attend to the finances If this family aint
well off pretty soon it wont be your Uncle Nates fault Only dont you
put your oar in where taint needed

Lord love you Gus didnt care about finances He was so full of joy at
bein made assistant to the great Ansel Whiskers Dixland that he forgot
everything else nerves and all

So in another day the four of em was landed on Ozone Island and so was
the freightcar load of crates and boxes Grub and necessaries was to be
provided by Scudderfor salary as stated and commission understood

It took Nate less than a week to find out what old Dixland was up to
When he learned it he set down in the sand and fairly snorted disgust
The old idiot was callatin to FLY Seems that for years hed been
experimentin with what he called aeroplanes and now hed reached the
stage where he blieved he could flap his wings and soar Thinks I
says Nate your life works cut out for you Nate Scudder Youll spend
the rest of your days as genral provider for the Ozone private asylum
Well Scudder want complainin none at the outlook He couldnt make a
good livin no easier

The aeroplane was in sections in them boxes and crates Nate and
Augustus and the professor got out the sections and fitted em together
The buildins on Ozone was all joined togetherfirst the house then
the ell then the washrooms and big sheds and finally the barn
There was doors connectin and you could go from house to barn both
downstairs and up without steppin outside once

Twas in the barn that they built what Whiskers called the flyin
stage Twas a long chute arrangement on trestles and the idea was
that the aeroplane was to get her start by slidin down the chute out
through the big doors and off by the atmosphere route to glory I say
that was the IDEA In practice she worked different

Twice the professor made proclamations that everything was ready and
twice they started that flyin machine goin The fust time Dixland
was at the helm and him and the aeroplane dropped headfust into the
sandbank just outside the barn The machine was underneath and the
pieces of it acted as a fender so all the professor fractured was his
temper But it took ten days to get the contraption ready for the next
fizzle Then poor shaky scart Augustus was pilot and he went so deep
into the bank that Nate says he wondered whether twas wuth while doin
anything but orderin the gravestone But they dug him out at last
whole but frightened blue and his nerves was worse than ever after
that

Then old Dixland announces that he has discovered somethin wrong in
the principle of the thing and they had to wait while he ordered some
new fittins from Boston

Meanwhile there was other complications settin in Scudder was kept
busy providin grub and such like and helpin the niece Olivia
with the housework Likewise he had his hands full keepin the
folks alongshore from findin out what was goin on All this flyin
foolishness had to be a dead secret

But busy as he was he found time to notice the thick acquaintance
that was developin between Augustus and Olivia Them two was what the
minister calls kindred sperrits Seems she was sufferin from science
same as he was and moren that she was loaded to the gunwale with
social reform To hear the pair of em go on about helpin the poor
and settlement work and such was enough accordin to Nate to make
you leave the table But there He couldnt complain Olivia was her
uncles only heir and Nate could see a rainbow of promise ahead for the
Scudder family

The niece was a nice quiet girl The only thing Nate had against her
outside of the sociology craziness and her not seemin to take a shine
to him was her confounded pets Nate said he never had no use for
petslazy critters eatin up the victuals and costin moneybut
Olivia was dead gone on em She adopted an old reprobate of a tomcat
which she labeled Galileo after an Eyetalian who invented spyglasses
or somethin similar and a great big ugly dog that answered to the hail
of Phillips Brooks she named him that because she said the original
Phillips was a distinguished parson and a great philanthropist

That dog was a healthy philanthropist When Nate kicked him the first
time he chased him the whole length of the barn After that they had to
keep him chained up He was just pinin for a chance to swaller Scudder
whole and he showed it

Well as time went on Olivia and Augustus got chummier and chummier
Nate give em all the chance possible to be together and as for old
Professor Whiskers all he thought of anyway was his blessed flyin
machine So things was shapin themselves well cordin to Scudders
notion

One afternoon Nate come unexpected to the top of a sand hill at
tother end of the island and there below set Olivia and Augustus
He had a clove hitch round her waist and they was lookin into each
others spectacles as if they was windows in the pearly gates Thinks
Nate Theyve signed articles and he tiptoed away feelin that life
want altogether an empty dream

They was lively hours them that followed To begin with when Nate got
back to the barn he found the professor layin on the floor under the
flyin stage groanin soulful but dismal Hed slipped off one of the
braces of the trestles and sprained both wrists and bruised himself till
he want much more than one big lump He hadnt bruised his tongue
none to speak of though and his language want sprained so that youd
notice it What broke him up most of all was that hed got his aeroplane
ready to fly again and now he was knocked out sos he couldnt be
aboard when she went off the ways

It is the irony of fate says he

I got it off the blacksmith over to Wellmouth Centre Nate told him
but HE might have got it from Fate or whoever you mean Twas slippery
iron I know that and I warned you against steppin on it yesterday

The professor moren hinted that Nate was a dunderhead idiot and then
he commenced to holler for Tolliver he wanted to see Tolliver right
off Scudder thought hed ought to see a doctor but he wouldnt so
Nate plastered him up best he could got him into the big chair in the
front room and went huntin Augustus Him and Olivia was still
camped in the sand bank Guss right arm had got tired by this time I
callate but he had a new hitch with his left Likewise they was still
starin into each others specs

Excuse me for interruptin the mesmerism says Nate but the
professor wants to see you

They jumped and broke away But it took moren that to bring em down
out of the clouds Theyd been flyin a good sight higher than the old
aeroplane had yet

Uncle Nathan says Augustus gettin up and shakin hands I have
the most wonderful news for you Its hardly believable Youll never
guess it

Give me three guesses and Ill win on the fust says Nate You two
are engaged

They looked at him as if hed done somethin wonderful But Uncle
says Gus shakin hands again just think shes actually consented to
marry me

Well thats genrally understood to be a part of engagin aint
it says Nate Im glad to hear it Miss Dixland I congratulate you
Youve got a fine promisin young man

That to Nates notion was about the biggest lie he ever told but
Olivia swallered it for gospel She seemed to thaw toward Scudder a
little mite but twant at a permanent melt by no means

Thank you Mr Scudder says she still pretty frosty I am full
aware of Mr Tollivers merits Im glad to learn that YOU recognize
them He has told some things concernin his stay at your home which

Yes yes says Nate kind of hurried Well Im sorry to dump bad
news into a puddle of happiness like this but your Uncle Ansel Miss
Dixland has been tryin to fly without his machine and hes sorry for
it

Then he told what had happened to the professor and Olivia started on
the run for the house Augustus was goin too but Nate held him back

Wait a minute Gus says he Walk along with me I want to talk with
you Now as an older man your nighest relation and one thats come to
love you like a sonyes sir like a sonI think its my duty just now
to say a word of advice Youre goin to marry a nice girl thats comin
in for a lot of money one of these days The professor hes kind of
old his roof leaks considerble and this trouble is likely to hurry
the end along

Now then Nate goes on Augustus my boy what are you and that
simple childlike girl goin to do with all that money How are you
goin to take care of it You and Liviayou mustnt mind my callin
her that cause shes goin to be one of the family so soonyoull
want to be fussin with science and such and you wont have no time
to attend to the finances Youll need a good safe person to be your
financial manager Well you know me and you know your Aunt Huldy Ann
WE know all about financin WEVE had experience You just let us
handle the bonds and coupons and them trifles Well invest em for you
Well be yours and Livias financial managers As for our wages maybe
theyll seem a little high but thats easy arranged And

Gus interrupted then Oh thats all settled he says Olivia and I
have planned all that When were married we shall devote our lives to
social workto settlement work All the money we ever get we shall use
to help the poor WE dont want any of it We shall live AMONG the poor
live just as frugally as they do Our money we shall giveevery cent of
itto charity and

Lord sakes yells Nate DONT talk that way Dont Be you crazy
too Why

But Gus went on talkin a steady streak about livin in a little
tenement in what he called the slums and chuckin the money to this
tramp and that till Nates head was whirlin Twant no joke He
meant it and so did she and they was just the pair of loons to do it
too

Afore Nate had a chance to think up anything sensible to say Olivia
comes hollerin for Gus to hurry Off he went and Nate followed
along holdin his head and staggerin like a voter comin home from a
political candidates picnic All he could think of was THIS the end
of all my plannin WhatWHATLL Huldy Ann say to THIS

Nate found the professor bolstered up in his chair with the other
two standin alongside He was layin down the law about that blessed
aeroplane

No no NO I tell you he roars Ill see no doctor My invention
is ready at last and if Im goin to die Ill die successful
Tolliver youve been a faithful worker with me and yours shall be the
privilege of makin the first flight Wheel me to the window Olivia
and let me see my triumph

But Olivia didnt move Instead she looked at Augustus and he at her
Wheel me to the window yells Dixland Tolliver what are you waitin
for The doors are open the aeroplane is ready Go this instant and
fly

Augustus was a bird all right cordin to Nates opinion but he
didnt seem anxious to spread his wings He was white and them nerves
of his was all in a twitter If ever there was a scart critter twas
him then

Go out and fly says Nate to him pretty average ugly Dont you
hear the bosss order Here professor Ill push you to the window

Thank you Scudder says Dixland And then turnin to Gus Well
sir may I ask why you wait

Twas Olivia that answered Uncle Ansel says she I must tell you
somethin I should have preferred tellin you privately she puts in
glarin at Nate but it seems I cant Mr Tolliver and I are engaged
to be married

Old Whiskers didnt seem to care a continental All he had in his
addled head was that flyin contraption

All right all right he snaps fretty Im satisfied He appears to
be a decent young man enough But now I want him to start my aeroplane

No Uncle Ansel goes on Olivia I cannot permit him to risk his
life in that way His nerves are not strong and neither is his heart
Besides the aeroplane has failed twice Luckily no one was killed in
the other trials but the chances are that the third time may prove
fatal

Fatal you imbecile shrieks the professor Its perfected I tell
you I

It makes no difference No uncle Augustus and I have made up our
minds His life and health are too precious he must be spared for the
grand work that we are to do together No Uncle Ansel he shall NOT
fly

Did you ever see a cat in a fit That was the professor just then so
Nate said He tried to wave his sprained wrists and couldnt tried to
stamp his foot and found it too lame But his eyeglasses flashed sparks
and his tongue spit fire

Are you goin to start that machine he screams at the bluewhite
shaky Augustus

No Professor Dixland stammers Gus No sir Im sorry but

Why dont you ask Mr Scudder to make the experiment uncle suggests
that confounded niece smilin the spitefullest smile

Scudder says the professor Ill give you five thousand dollars
cash to start in that aeroplane this moment

For a jiffy Nate was staggered Five thousand dollars CASHwhew But
then he thought of how deep Gus had been shoved into that sandbank
And there was a new and more powerful motor aboard the thing now Five
thousand dollars aint much good to a telescoped corpse He fetched a
long breath

Well now Mr Dixland he says Id like to fust rate but you see
I dont know nothin about mechanics

Professor begins Augustus Twas the final straw Old Whiskers
jumped out of the chair lameness and all

Out of this house you ingrate he bellers Out this instant I
discharge you Go go

He was actually frothin at the mouth I callate Olivia thought he was
goin to die for she run to him

Youd better go I think says she to her shakin beau Go dear
now I must stay with him for the present but we will see each other
soon Go now and trust me

I disown you you ungrateful girl foams her uncle Scudder I order
you to put thatthat creature off this island

Yes sir says Nate polite in about two shakes of a heifers
tail

He started for Augustus and Gus started for the door I guess Olivia
might have interfered but just then the professor keels over in a kind
of faint and she had to tend to him Gus darts out of the door with Nate
after him Scudder reached the beach just as his nephew was shovin off
in the boat bound for the mainland

Consarn your empty head Nate yelled after him See what you get by
not mindin me dont you Im runnin things on this island after this
Im boss here understand When youre ready to sign a paper deedin
over haf that money your wifes goin to get to me and Huldy Ann maybe
Ill let you come back And perhaps then Ill square things for you with
Dixland But if you dare to set foot on these premises until then Ill
murder you Ill drown you Ill cut you up for bait Ill feed you to
the dog

He sculled off his oars rattlin Hark from the tomb in the rowlocks
He blieved Nate meant it all Oh Scudder had HIM trained all right




CHAPTER VII

CAPTAIN SOL DECIDES TO MOVE


Trust Nate for that interrupted Wingate Hes just as much a born
bully as he is a cheat and a skinflint

Yup went on Captain Sol Well when Nate got back to the house the
professor was alone in the chair lookin sick and weak Olivia was up
in her room havin a cryin fit Nate got the old man to bed made him
some clam soup and hot tea and fetched and carried for him like he was
a baby The professors talk was mainly about the ungrateful desertion
as he called it of his assistant

Keep him away from this island he says If he comes I shall commit
murder I know it

Scudder promised that Augustus shouldnt come back The professor
wanted guard kept night and day Nate said he didnt knows he could
afford so much time and Dixland doubled his wages on the spot So Nate
agreed to stand double watches made him comfortble for the night and
left him

Olivia didnt come downstairs again She didnt seem to want any
supper but Nate did and had it a good one Galileo the cat came
yowlin around and Nate kicked him under the sofy Phillips Brooks
was howlin starvation in the woodshed and Scudder let him howl If
he starved to death Nate wouldnt put no flowers on his grave Take it
altogether he was havin a fairly good time

And when later on he set alone up in his room over the kitchen he
begun to have a better one Prospects looked good Maybe old Dixland
WOULD disown his niece If he did Nate figgered he was as healthy a
candidate for adoption as anybody And Augustus would have to come to
terms or stay single That is unless him and Olivia got married on
nothin a week paid yearly Nate guessed Huldy Ann would think hed
managed pretty well

He set there for a long while thinkin and then he says he callates
he must have dozed off At any rate next thing he knew he was settin
up straight in his chair listenin It seemed to him that hed heard a
sound in the kitchen underneath

He looked out of the window and right away he noticed somethin Twas
a beautiful clear moonlight night and the high board fence around the
buildins showed black against the white sand And in that white
strip was a tenfoot white gape Nate had shut that gate afore he went
upstairs Whod opened it Then he heard the noise in the kitchen again
Somebody was talkin down there

Nate got up and tiptoed acrost the room He was in his stockin feet
so he didnt make a sound He reached into the corner and took out his
old duck gun It was loaded both barrels Nate cocked the gun and crept
down the back stairs

There was a lamp burnin low on the kitchen table and there in a
couple of chairs hauled as close together as they could be set
that Olivia niece and Augustus They was in a clove hitch again and
whisperin soft and slushy

My but Scudder was bilin He give one jump and landed in the middle
of that kitchen floor

Youyouyou he yelled wavin the shotgun Youre back here are
you You know what I told you Id do to you Well now Ill do it

The pair of em had jumped about as far as Nate had only the opposite
way Augustus was a paralyzed statue but Olivia had her senses with
her

Run Augustus she screamed Hell shoot you Run

And then with a screech like a siren whistle Augustus commenced to
run Nate was between him and the outside door so he bolted headfirst
into the dining room And after him went Nate Scudder so crazy mad he
didnt know what he was doin

Twas pitch dark in the dining room but through it they went rattlety
bang dishes smashin chairs upsettin and hurrah boys to pay
genrally Then through the best parlor and into the front hall

I callate Nate would have had him at the foot of the front stairs if
it hadnt been for Galileo That cat had been asleep on the sofy and
the noise and hullabaloo had stirred him up till he was as crazy as the
rest of em He run right under Nates feet and down went Nate sprawlin
and both barrels of the shotgun bust loose like a couple of cannon

Galileo took for tall timber whoopin anthems Up them front stairs
went Augustus screechin shrill like a woman he was SURE Nate meant
to murder him now And after him his uncle went on all fours swearin
tremendous

Then twas through one bedroom after another and each one more crowded
with noisy smashable things than that previous Nate said he could
remember the professor roarin Fire and Help as the two of em
bumped into his bed but they didnt stopthey was too busy The whole
length of the house upstairs they traveled then through the ell then
the woodshed loft and finally out into the upper story of the barn And
there Nate knew he had him The ladder was down

Now says Nate Now you longlegged villain if I dont give you
whats comin to you thenOh there aint no use in your climbin out
there you cant get down

The big barn doors was open and in the moonlight Nate could see
Gus scramblin up and around on the flyin stage where the professors
aeroplane was perched lookin like some kind of magnified June bug

Come back you fool Scudder yelled at him Come back and be
butchered You might as well its too high for you to drop You wont
Then Ill come after you

Nate says he never shall forget Augustuss face in the blue light when
he see his uncle climbin out on that stage after him He was simply
desperatethats it desperate And the next thing he did was jump into
the saddle of the machine and pull the startin lever

There was the buzz of the electric motor a slippery slidin sound
one awful hairraisin whoop from Augustus and thenFssstdown
the flyin stage whizzed that aeroplane and out through the doors

Nate set down on the trestles and waited for the sound of the smash
I guess he actually felt conscience stricken Of course hed only done
his duty and yet

But no smash came Instead there was a long scream from the
kitchenOlivias voice that was And then another yell that for pure
joy beat anything ever heard

It flies screamed Professor Ansel Hobart Whiskers Dixland from his
bedroom window At last At last It FLIES

It took Nate some few minutes to paw his way back through the shed loft
and the ell over the things him and Gus knocked down on the fust lap
until he got to his room where the trouble had started Then he went
down to the kitchen and outdoor

Olivia a heavenly sort of look on her face was standin in the
moonlight with her hands clasped lookin up at the sky

It flies says she in a kind of whisper over and over again Oh it
FLIES

Alongside of her was old Dixland wrapped in a bedquilt forgettin all
about sprains and lameness and he likewise was staring at the sky and
sayin over and over

It flies It really FLIES

And Nate looked up and there scootin around in circles now up high
and now down low tippin this way and tippin that was that aeroplane
And in the stillness you could hear the buzz of the motor and the yells
of Augustus

Down flopped Scudder in the sand Great land of love he says it
FLIES

Well for five minutes or so they watched that thing swoop and duck and
sail up there overhead And then slow and easy as a feather in a May
breeze down she flutters and lands soft on a hummock a little ways off
And that Augustusa fool for luckstaggers out of it safe and sound
and sets down and begins to cry

The fust thing to reach him was Olivia She grabbed him around the
neck and you never heard such goins on as them two had Nate come
hurryin up

Here you he says pullin em apart Thats enough of this And
you he adds to Gus clear right out off this island I wont make
shark bait of you this time but

And then comes Dixland hippityhop over the hummocks My noble boy
he sings out fallin all of a heap onto Augustuss round shoulders My
noble boy My hero

Nate looked on for a full minute with his mouth open Olivia went away
toward the house The professor and Gus was sheddin tears like a couple
of waterin pots

Come come says Scudder finally get up Mr Dixland youll catch
cold Now then you Tolliver toddle right along to your boat Dont you
worry professor Ill fix him sos he wont come here no more

But the professor turned on him like a flash

How dare you interfere says he I forgive him everything He is a
hero Why man he FLEW

Olivia came up behind and touched Nate on the shoulders Dont
you think youd better go Mr Scudder she purred Ive unchained
Phillips Brooks

Nate swears he never made better time than he done gettin to the shore
and the boat Augustus had come over in But that philanthropist dog only
missed the supper hed been waitin for by about a foot and a half even
as twas

And that was the end of it furs Nate was concerned Olivia was boss
from then on and Scudder want allowed to land on his own island And
pretty soon they all went away flyin machine and all and now Gus and
Olivia are married

Well by gum cried Wingate Say that must have broke Nates heart
completely All that good money goin to the poor Ha ha

Yes said Captain Sol with a broad grin Nate told me that every
time he realized that Guss flyin at all was due to his scarin him
into it it fairly made him sick of life

What did Huldy Ann say Ill bet the fur flew when SHE heard of it

I guess likely it did Scudder says her jawins was the worst of all
Her principal complaint was that he didnt take up with the professors
fivethousand offer and try to fly What if twas risky she says
If anything happened to you the five thousand would have come to your
heirs wouldnt it But no you never think of no one but yourself

Mr Wingate glanced at his watch Good land he cried I didnt
realize twas so late I must trot along down and meet Stitt He and I
are goin to corner the clam market

I must be goin too said the depot master rising and moving toward
the door picking up his cap on the way He threw open the door and
exclaimed Hello heres Sim What you got on your mind Sim

Mr Phinney looked rather solemn I wanted to speak with you a minute
Sol he began Hello Barzilla I didnt know you was here

I shant be here but one second longer replied Mr Wingate as he and
Phinney shook hands Im late already Baileyll think I aint comin
Goodby boys See you this afternoon maybe

Yes do cried Berry as his guest hurried down to the gate I want
to hear about those automobiles over your way You aint bought one
have you Barzilla

Wingate grinned over his shoulder No he called I aint But other
folks you know have Its the biggest joke on earth You and Simll want
to hear it

He waved a big hand and walked briskly up the Shore Road The depot
master turned to his friend

Well Sim he asked

Well Sol answered the building mover gravely Ive just met Mr
Hilton the minister and he told me somethin about Olive Edwards
somethin I thought youd want to know You said for me to find out what
she was callatin to do when she had to give up her home and

I know what I said interrupted the depot master rather sharply What
did Hilton say

Mr Hilton told me not to tell continued Phinney and I shant tell
nobody but you Sol I know you wont t mention it The minister says
that Olives hard up as she can be All shes got in the world is the
little furniture and store stuff in her house The store stuff dont
amount to nothin but the furniture belonged to her pa and ma and she
set a heap by it Likewise as everybody knows shes awful proud and
selfrespectin Anything like charity would kill her Now out Westin
Omaha or somewheresshes got a cousin who owed her dad money Old
Capn Seabury lent this Omaha man two or three thousand dollars and set
him up in business Course the debts outlawed but Olive dont
realize that or if she did it wouldnt count with her She couldnt
understand how law would have any effect on payin money you honestly
owe Shes written to the Omaha cousin tellin him what a scrape shes
in and askin him to please if convenient let her have a thousand or
so on account She figgers if she gets that she can go to Bayport or
Orham or somewheres and open another notion store

Captain Berry lit a cigar Hum he said after a minute You say
shes written to this chap Has she got an answer yet

No not any definite one She heard from the mans wife sayin that her
husbandthe cousinhad gone on a fishin trip somewheres up in Canady
and wouldnt be back afore the eighth of next month Soons he does come
hell write her But Mr Hilton thinks and so do Ihavin heard a
few things about this cousinthat its mighty doubtful if he sends any
money

Yes I shouldnt wonder Wheres Olive goin to stay while shes
waitin to hear

In her own house Mr Hilton went to Williams and pleaded with him and
he finally agreed to let her stay there until the Colonial is moved
onto the lot Then the Edwardses housell be tore down and Olivell have
to go of course

The depot master puffed thoughtfully at his cigar

She wont hear before the tenth at the earliest he said And if
Williams begins to move his Colonial at once hell get it to her lot
by the seventh sure Have you given him your figures for the job

Handed em in this very mornin One of his highandmighty servants
all brass buttons and braid like a feller playin in the band took my
letter and condescended to say hed pass it on to Williams Id liked
to have kicked the critter just to see if he COULD unbend but I jedged
twouldnt be good business

Probably not If the Colonial gets to Olives lot afore she hears
from the Omaha man what then

Well thats the worst of it The minister dont know what shell do
Theres plenty of places where shed be moren welcome to visit a spell
but shes too proud to accept Mr Hiltons afraid shell start for
Boston to hunt up a job or somethin You know how much chance she
stands of gettin a job thats wuth anything

Phinney paused anxiously awaiting his companions reply When it came
it was very unsatisfactory

Im goin to the depot said the Captain brusquely So long Sim

He slammed the door of the house behind him strode to the gate flung
it open and marched on Simeon gazed in astonishment then hurried
to overtake him Ranging alongside he endeavored to reopen the
conversation but to no purpose The depot master would not talk They
turned into Cross Street

Well exclaimed Mr Phinney panting from his unaccustomed hurry
what be we runnin a race Why    Oh how dye do Mr Williams
sir Want to see me do you

The magnate of East Harniss stepped forward

ErPhinney he said I want a moment of your time Morning Berry

Mornin Williams observed Captain Sol brusquely All right Sim
Ill wait for you farther on

He continued his walk The building mover stood still Mr Williams
frowned with lofty indignation

Phinney he said Ive just looked over those figures of yours your
bid for moving my new house The price is ridiculous

Simeon attempted a pleasantry Yes he answered I thought twas
ridiclous myself but I needed the money so I thought I could afford
to be funny

The Williams frown deepened

I didnt mean ridiculously low he snapped I meant ridiculously
high Id rather help out you town fellows if I can but you cant work
me for a good thing Ive written to Colt and Adams of Boston and
accepted their offer You had your chance and didnt see fit to take it
Thats all Im sorry

Simeon was angry also a trifle skeptical

Mr Williams he demanded do you mean to tell me that THEM people
have agreed to move you cheapern I can

Their pricetheir actual price may be no lower but considering their
uptodate outfit anderprogressive methods theyre cheaper Yes
Morning Phinney

He turned on his heel and walked off Mr Phinney crestfallen and
angrier than ever moved on to where the depot master stood waiting for
him Captain Sol smiled grimly

You dont look merry as a Christmas tree Sim he observed What did
his Majesty have to say to you

Simeon related the talk with Williams The depot masters grim smile
grew broader

Sim he asked with quiet sarcasm dont you realize that progressive
methods are necessary in movin a house

Phinney tried to smile in return but the attempt was a failure

Yes went on the Captain Well if you cant take the Grand
Panjandrum home you can set on the fence and see him go by That
ought to be honor enough hadnt it However I may need some of your
ridiculous figgers on a movin job of my own pretty soon Dont be TOO
comical will you

What do you mean by that Sol Berry

I mean that I may decide to move my own house

Move your OWN house Where to for mercy sakes

To that lot on Main Street that belongs to Abner Payne Abner has
wanted to buy my lot here on the Shore Road for a long time He knows
itll make a fine site for some rich bigbugs summer cottage He would
have bought the house too but I think too much of that to sell it
Now Abners come back with another offer Hell swap my lot for the Main
Street one pay my movin expenses and a fair boot besides He dont
really care for my HOUSE you understand its my LAND hes after

Are you goin to take it up

I dont know The Main Street lots a good one and my housell look
good on it And Ill make money by the deal

Yes but youve always swore by that saltwater view of yours Told me
yourself you never wanted to live anywheres else

Captain Sol took the cigar from his lips looked at it then threw it
violently into the gutter

What difference does it make where I live he snarled Who in blazes
cares where I live or whether I live at all

Sol Berry what on airth

Shut up Let me alone Sim I aint fit company for anybody just now
Clear out theres a good feller

The next moment he was striding down the hill Mr Phinney drew a long
breath scratched his head and shook it solemnly WHAT did it all mean




CHAPTER VIII

THE OBLIGATIONS OF A GENTLEMAN


The methods of Messrs Colt and Adams the Boston firm of building
movers were certainly progressive if promptness in getting to work
is any criterion Two days after the acceptance of their terms by Mr
Williams a freight car full of apparatus arrived at East Harniss Then
came a foreman and a gang of laborers Horses were hired and within a
week the pure Colonial was off its foundations and on its way to the
Edwards lot The moving was no light task The big house must be brought
along the Shore Road to the junction with the Hill Boulevard then swung
into that aristocratic highway and carried up the long slope around the
wide curve to its destination

Mr Phinney though he hated the whole operation those having it in
charge and the mighty Williams especially could not resist stealing
down to see how his successful rivals were progressing with the work
he had hoped to do It caused him much chagrin to see that they were
getting on so very well One morning after breakfast as he stood at
the corner of the Boulevard and the Shore Road he found himself engaged
in a mental calculation

Three days more and they would swing into the Boulevard four or five
days after that and they would be abreast the Edwards lot Another day
and    Poor Olive She would be homeless Where would she go It
was too early for a reply from the Omaha cousin but Simeon having
questioned the minister had little hope that that reply would be
favorable Still it was a chance and if the money SHOULD come before
the pure Colonial reached the Edwards lot then the widow would at
least not be driven penniless from her home She would have to leave
that home in any event but she could carry out her project of opening
another shop in one of the neighboring towns Otherwise    Mr
Phinney swore aloud

Humph said a voice behind him I agree with you though I dont
know what its all about I aint heard anything better put for a long
while

Simeon spun around as he said afterwards like a young ones
pinwheel At his elbow stood Captain Berry the depot master hands
in pockets cigar in mouth the personification of calmness and
imperturbability He had come out of his house which stood close to the
corner and walked over to join his friend

Land of love exclaimed Simeon Why dont you scare a fellow to
death tiptoein around I never see such a catfoot critter

Captain Sol smiled Jumpin it aint they he said nodding toward
the Colonial Be there by the tenth wont it

Tenth Mr Phinney sniffed disgust Itll be there by the sixth or I
miss my guess

Yup Say Sim how soon could you land that shanty of mine in the road
if I give you the job to move it

I couldnt get it up to the Main Street lot inside of a fortnight
replied Sim after a moments reflection Furs gettin it in the road
goes I could have it here day after tomorrow if I had gang enough

The depot master took the cigar out of his mouth and blew a ring of
smoke All right he drawled get gang enough

Phinney jumped You mean youve decided to take up with Paynes offer
and swap your lot for his he gasped Why only two or three days ago
you said

Yaas That was two or three days ago and Ive been watchin the
Colonial since I callate the movin habits catchin You have your
gang here by noon today

Sol Berry are you crazy You aint seen Abner Payne hes out of
town

Dont have to see him Hes made me an offer and Ill write and accept
it

But youve got to have a selectmens permit to move

Got it I went up and saw the chairman an hour ago Hes a friend of
mine I nominated him townmeetin day

But stammered Phinney very much upset by the suddenness of it all
you aint got my price nor

Drat your price Give it when I ask it See here Sim are you goin to
have my house in the middle of the road by day after tomorrer Or was
that just talk

Twant talk I can have it there but

All right said Captain Sol coolly then have it

Hands in pockets he strolled away Simeon sat down on a rock by the
roadside and whistled

However whistling was a luxurious and timewasting method of expressing
amazement and Mr Phinney could not afford luxuries just then For the
rest of that day he was a busy man As Bailey Stitt expressed it he
flew round like a sand flea in a mitten hiring laborers engaging
masons and getting his materials ready That very afternoon the masons
began tearing down the chimneys of the little Berry house Before the
close of the following day it was on the rollers By two of the day
after that it was in the middle of the Shore Road just when its mover
had declared it should be They were moving it furniture and all
and Captain Sol was as he said going to stay right aboard all the
voyage No cooking could be done of course but the Captain arranged
to eat at Mrs Higginss hospitable table during the transit His sudden
freak was furnishing material for gossip throughout the village but he
did not care Gossip concerning his actions was the last thing in the
world to trouble Captain Sol Berry

The Williamss Colonial was moving toward the corner at a rapid
rate and the foreman of the Boston moving firm walked over to see Mr
Phinney

Say he observed to Simeon who the perspiration streaming down
his face was resting for a moment before recommencing his labor of
arranging rollers say observed the foreman well be ready to turn
into the Boulevard by tomorrer night and youre blockin the way

Thats all right said Simeon well be past the Boulevard corner by
that time

He thought he was speaking the truth but next morning before work
began Captain Berry appeared He had had breakfast and strolled around
to the scene of operations

Well asked Phinney howd it seem to sleep on wheels

Tiptop replied the depot master Like it fust rate Spose my next
berth will be somewheres up there wont it

He was pointing around the corner instead of straight ahead Simeon
gaped his mouth open

Up THERE he cried Why of course not Thats the Boulevard Were
goin along the Shore Road

That so I guess not Were goin by the Boulevard Can go that way
cant we

Can repeated Simeon aghast Course we CAN But its like boxin the
whole compass backward to get haf a pint east of noth Its way round
Robin Hoods barn Itll take twice as long and cost

Thats good interrupted the Captain I like to travel and Im
willin to pay for it Think of the view Ill get on the way

But your permit from the selectmen began Phinney Berry held up his
hand

My permit never said nothin about the course to take he answered
his eye twinkling just a little There Sim youre wastin time I
move by the Hill Boulevard

And into the Boulevard swung the Berry house The Colt and Adams foreman
was an angry man when he saw the beams laid in that direction He rushed
over and asked profane and pointed questions

Thought you said you was goin straight ahead he demanded

Thought I was replied Simeon but you see Im only navigator of
this craft not owner

Where is the blankety blank asked the foreman

If youre referrin to Capn Berry I callate youll find him at
the depot answered Phinney To the depot went the foreman Receiving
little satisfaction there he hurried to the home of his employer Mr
Williams The magnate redfaced and angry returned with him to
the station Captain Sol received them blandly Issy who heard the
interview which followed declared that the depot master was so cool
that an iceberg was a bonfire longside of him Issys description
of this interview given to a dozen townspeople within the next three
hours was as follows

Mr Williams said the wideeyed Issy he comes postin into the
waitin room his foreman with him Williams marches over to Capn Sol
and he says Berry he says are you responsible for the way that
house of yours is moved

Capn Sol bowed and smiled Yes says he sweet as a fresh scallop

Youre movin it to Main Street arent you I so understood

You understood correct Thats where shes bound

Then what do you mean by turning out of your road and into mine

Oh I dont own any road Have you bought the Boulevard The selectmen
ought to have told us that I sposed it was town thoroughfare

Mr Williams colored up a little I didnt mean my road in that
sense he says But the direct way to Main Street is along the
shore and everybody knows it Now why do you turn from that into the
Boulevard

Capn Sol took a cigar from his pocket Have one says he passin it
toward Mr Williams No Too soon after breakfast I spose Why do
I turn off he goes on Well Ill tell you Im goin to stay right
aboard my shack while its movin and its so much pleasanter a ride up
the hill that I thought Id go that way I always envied them who could
afford a house on the Boulevard and now Ive got the chance to have one
therefor a spell Im sartin I shall enjoy it

The foreman growled disgusted Mr Williams got redder yet

Dont you understand he snorts Youre blockin the way of the
house IM movin I have capable men with adequate apparatus to move
it and they would be able to go twice as fast as your onehorse country
outfit Youre blockin the road Now they must follow you Its an
outrage

Capn Sol smiled once more Too bad says he Its a pity such
a nice street aint wider If it was my street in my townI blieve
thats what you call East Harniss aint itseems to me Id widen it

The boss of my town ground his heel into the sand Berry he snaps
are you goin to move that house over the Boulevard ahead of mine

The Capn looked him square in the eye Williams says he I am

The millionaire turned short and started to go

Youll pay for it he snarls his temper gettin free at last

I callate to purrs the Capn I genrally do pay for what I want
and a fair price at that I never bought in cheap mortgages and held
em for clubs over poor folks never in my life Good mornin

And right to Mr Williamss own face too concluded Issy WHAT do
you think of that

Here was defiance of authority and dignity a sensation which should
have racked East Harniss from end to end But most of the men in the
village the tradespeople particularly had another matter on their
minds namely Major Cuthbertson Scott Hardee of Silverleaf Hall The
Major and his debts were causing serious worriment

The creditors of the Major met according to agreement on the Monday
evening following their previous gathering at the club Obed Gott one
of the first to arrive greeted his fellow members with an air of gloomy
triumph and a sort of condescending pity

Higgins the general store keeper acting as selfappointed chairman
asked if anyone had anything to report For himself he had seen the
Major and asked pointblank for payment of his bill The Major had been
very polite and was apparently much concerned that his fellow townsmen
should have been inconvenienced by any neglect of his He would write to
his attorneys at once so he said

He said a whole lot more too added Higgins Said he had never been
better served than by the folks in this town and that I kept a fine
store and so on and so forth But I havent got any money yet Anybody
else had any better luck

No one had although several had had similar interviews with the master
of Silverleaf Hall

Obed looks as if he knew somethin remarked Weeks What is it
Obed

Mr Gott scornfully waved his hand

You fellers make me laugh he said You talk and talk but you dont
do nothin I blieve in doin myself When I went home tother night
thinks I Theres one man that might know somethin bout old Hardee
and thats Godfrey the hotel man So I wrote to Godfrey up to Boston
and I got a letter from him Here tis

He read the letter aloud Mr Godfrey wrote that he knew nothing about
Major Hardee further than that he had been able to get nothing from him
in payment for his board

So I seized his trunk the letter concluded There was nothing in it
worth mentioning but I took it on principle The Major told me a
lot about writing to his attorneys for money but I didnt pay much
attention to that Im afraid hes an old fraud but I cant help liking
him and if I had kept on running my hotel I guess he would have got
away scotfree

There exclaimed the triumphant Obed with a sneer I guess that
settles it dont it Maybe youd be willin to turn your bills over to
Squire Baker now

But they were not willing Higgins argued and justly that although the
Major was in all probability a fraud not even a lawyer could get water
out of a stone and that when a man had nothing suing him was a waste
of time and cash

Besides he said theres just a chance that he may have attorneys
and property somewheres else Lets write him a letter and every one of
us sign it tellin him that well call on him Tuesday night expectin
to be paid in full If we call and dont get any satisfaction why
we aint any worse off and then we canwell run him out of town if
nothin more

So the letter was written and signed by every man there It was a long
list of signatures and an alarming total of indebtedness The letter was
posted that night

The days that followed seemed long to Obed He was illnatured at home
and ugly at the shop and Polena declared that he was gettin so a body
couldnt live with him Her own spirits were remarkably high and Obed
noticed that as the days went by she seemed to be unusually excited
On Thursday she announced that she was going to Orham to visit her
niece one Sarah Emma Cahoon and wouldnt be back right off He knew
better than to object and so she went

That evening each of the signers of the letter to Major Hardee received
a courteous note saying that the Major would be pleased to receive the
gentlemen at the Hall Nothing was said about payment

So after some discussion the creditors marched in procession across
the fields and up to Silverleaf Hall

Hardees been to Orham today whispered the keeper of the livery
stable as they entered the yard He drove over this mornin and come
back tonight

DROVE over exclaimed Obed halting in his tracks He did Whered he
get the team Ill bet five dollars you was soft enough to let him have
it and never said a word Well if you aintBy jimmy you wait till I
get at him Ill show you that he cant soft soap me

Augustus met them at the door and ushered them into the oldfashioned
parlor The Major calm cool and imperturbably polite was waiting to
receive them He made some observation concerning the weather

The days fine enough interrupted Obed pushing to the front but
that aint what we come here to talk about Are you goin to pay us what
you owe Thats what we want to know

The gentleman of the old school did not answer immediately Instead he
turned to the solemn servant at his elbow

Augustus he said you may make ready Then looking serenely at the
irate Mr Gott whose clenched fist rested under the center table which
he had thumped to emphasize his demands the Major asked

I beg your pardon my dear sir but what is the total of my
indebtedness to you

Nineteen dollars and twentyeight cents and I want you to understand
that

Major Hardee held up a slim white hand

One moment if you please he said Now Augustus

Augustus opened the desk in the corner and produced an imposing stack of
bank notes Then he brought forth neat piles of halves quarters dimes
and pennies and arranged the whole upon the table Obeds mouth and
those of his companions gaped in amazement

Have you your bill with you Mr Gott inquired the Major

Dazedly Mr Gott produced the required document

Thank you Augustus nineteen twentyeight to this gentleman Kindly
receipt the bill Mr Gott if you please A mere formality of course
but it is well to be exact Thank you sir And now Mr Higgins

One by one the creditors shamefacedly stepped forward received the
amount due receipted the bill and stepped back again Mr Peters the
photographer was the last to sign

Gentlemen said the Major I am sorry that my carelessness in
financial matters should have caused you this trouble but now that you
are here a representative gathering of East Harnisss men of affairs
upon this night of all nights it seems fitting that I should ask for
your congratulations Augustus

The woodenfaced Augustus retired to the next room and reappeared
carrying a tray upon which were a decanter and glasses

Gentlemen continued the Major I have often testified to my
admiration and regard for yourperhaps I may now say OURcharming
village This admiration and regard has extended to the fair daughters
of the township It may be that some of you have conscientious scruples
against the use of intoxicants These scruples I respect but I am sure
that none of you will refuse to at least taste a glass of wine with me
when I tell you that I have this day taken one of the fairest to love
and cherish during life

He stepped to the door of the dining room opened it and said quietly
My dear will you honor us with your presence

There was a rustle of black silk and there came through the doorway the
stately form of her who had been Mrs Polena Ginn

Gentlemen said the Major permit me to present to you my wife the
new mistress of Silverleaf Hall

The faces of the excreditors were pictures of astonishment Mr Gotts
expressive countenance turned white then red and then settled to a
mottled shade almost as if he had the measles Polena rushed to his
side

O Obed she exclaimed I know wed ought to have told you but twas
only Tuesday the Major asked me and we thought wed keep it a secret
sos to sprise you Mr Langworthy over to Orham married us and

My dear her husband blandly interrupted we will not intrude our
private affairs upon the patience of these good friends And now
gentlemen let me propose a toast To the health and happiness of the
mistress of Silverleaf Hall Brother Obed I

The outside door closed with a slam Brother Obed had fled

A little later when the rest of the former creditors of the Major came
out into the moonlight they found their companion standing by the
gate gazing stonily into vacancy Hen Leadbetter who with Higgins
brought up the rear of the procession said reflectively

When he fust fetched out that stack of money I couldnt scarcely
blieve my eyes I begun to think that we fellers had put our foot in
it for sartin and had lost a mighty good customer but of course its
all plain enough NOW

Yes remarked Weeks with a nod I allers heard that Plena kept a
mighty good balance in the bank

It looks to me said Higgins slyly as if we owed Obed here a vote of
thanks How bout that Obed

And then Major Hardees new brotherinlaw awoke with a jump

Aw you go to grass he snarled and tramped savagely off down the
hill




CHAPTER IX

THE WIDOW BASSETT


These developments Major Hardees marriage and Mr Gotts discomfiture
overshadowed for the time local interest in the depot masters house
moving This was in its way rather fortunate for those who took the
trouble to walk down to the lower end of the Boulevard were astonished
to see how very slowly the moving was progressing

Only one horse Sim asked Captain Hiram Baker Only one Why itll
take you forever to get through wont it

Im afraid itll take quite a spell admitted Mr Phinney

Wheres your other one the white one

The white horse said Simeon slowly aint feelin just right and
Ive had to lay him off

Humph thats too bad How does Sol act about it Hes such a hustler
I should think

Sol interrupted Sim aint unreasonable He understands

He chuckled inwardly as he said it Captain Sol did understand Also Mr
Phinney himself was beginning to understand a little

The very day on which Williams and his foreman had called on the depot
master and been dismissed so unceremoniously that official paid a short
visit to his mover

Sim he said the twinkle still in his eye his Majesty Williams
the Conqueror was in to see me just now and acted real peevish He was
pretty disrespectful to you too Called your outfit one horse Thats
a mistake because youve got two horses at work right now It seems a
shame to make a great man like that lie Hadnt you better lay off one
of them horses

Lay one OFF exclaimed Simeon What for Why well be slow enough
as tis With only one horse we wouldnt get through for I dont know
how long

Thats so murmured the Captain I spose with one horse youd hardly
reach the middle of the Boulevard bywell before the tenth of the
month Hey

The tenth of the month The TENTH Why it was on the tenth that that
Omaha cousin of Olive Edwards was toMr Phinney began to seeto see
and to grin slow but expansive

Hmmm he mused

Yes observed Captain Sol That white horse of yours looks sort of
ailin to me Sim I think he needs a rest

And sure enough next day the white horse was pronounced unfit and
taken back to the stable The depot masters dwelling moved but that is
all one could say truthfully concerning its progress

At the depot the Captain was quieter than usual He joked with his
assistant less than had been his custom and for the omission Issy
was duly grateful Sometimes Captain Sol would sit for minutes without
speaking He seemed to be thinking and to be pondering some grave
problem When his friends Mr Wingate Captain Stitt Hiram Baker and
the rest dropped in on him he cheered up and was as conversational as
ever After they had gone he relapsed into his former quiet mood

He acts sort of blue to me declared Issy speaking from the depths
of sensationalnovel knowledge If he was a younger man Id say he was
most likely in love Ah hum I spose bein in love does get a feller
mournful dont it

Issy made this declaration to his mother only He knew better than to
mention sentiment to male acquaintances The latter were altogether too
likely to ask embarrassing questions

Mr Wingate and Captain Stitt were still in town although their stay
was drawing to a close One afternoon they entered the station together
Captain Sol seemed glad to see them

Set down fellers he ordered I swan Im glad to see you I aint
fit company for myself these days

Aint Betsy Higgins feedin you up to the mark asked Stitt Or is
house movin gettin on your vitals

No growled the depot master grubs all right and sos movin
I callate Im glad you fellers come in Whats the news to Orham
Barzilla Hows the Old Home House boarders standin it Hear from
Jonadab regular do you

Mr Wingate laughed Nothin much he said Jonadabs too busy
to write these days Bein a sport interferes with letter writing
considerble

Sport exclaimed Captain Bailey Land of Goshen Capn Jonadab is the
last one Id call a sport

Thats cause you aint a good judge of human nature Bailey chuckled
Barzilla When ancient plants like Jonadab Wixon DO bloom theyre gay
old blossoms I tell you

What do you mean asked the depot master

I mean that Jonadabs been givin me heart disease thats what givin
it to me in a good many diffrent ways too We opened the Old Home
House the middle of April this year because Peter T Brown thought we
might catch some spring trade We did catch a little though whether it
paid to open up so earlys a question But twas June fore Jonadab got
his disease so awful bad However most any time in the last part of May
the reglar programme of the male boarders was stirrin him up

Take it of a dull day for instance Sky overcast and the wind aidgin
round to the soueast sos you couldnt tell whether twould rain or
fair off too cold to go off to the ledge cod fishin and too hot for
billiards or bowlin a bunch of the younger women folks at one end
of the piazza playin bridge half a dozen men includin me and Capn
Jonadab smokin and tryin to keep awake at tother end amidships a
gang of femalesall fresh air fiendsand mainly widows or discards
in the matrimony deal doin fancywork and gossip That would be about
the usual layout

Conversation got to you in homeopath doses somethin like this

Did you say Spades WELL if Id known you were going to make us
lose our deal like that Id never have bridged itnot with THIS hand

Oh Miss Gabble have you heard what people are sayin about The
rest of it whispers

AooOW By George Bill this is dead enough isnt it Shall we
match for the cigars or are you too lazy

Then from away off in the stillness would come a drawnout Honk
honk like a wild goose with the asthma and pretty soon up the road
would come sailin a big red automobile loaded to the guards with
goggles and grandeur and whiz past the hotel in a hurricane of dust and
smell Then all hands would set up and look interested and Bill would
wink acrost at his chum and drawl

Thats the way to get over the country Why a horse isnt
onetwothree with that Capn Wixon Im surprised that a sportin
man like you hasnt bought one of those things long afore this

For the next twenty minutes there wouldnt be any dullness Jonadab
would take care of that Hed have the floor and be givin his opinions
of autos and them that owned and run em And between the drops of his
language shower youd see them boarders nudgin each other and rockin
back and forth contented and joyful

It always worked No matter what time of day or night all you had to
say was auto and Capn Jonadab would sail up out of his chair like one
of them hotair balloons the youngsters nowadays have on Fourth of July
And he wouldnt come down till he was empty of remarks nuther You
never see a man get so red faced and eloquent

It want because he couldnt afford one himself I know thats the
usual reason for them kind of ascensions but twant his No sir
the summer hotel business has put a considerable number of dollars in
Jonadabs hands and the said hands are like a patent rat trap a
mighty sight easier to get into than out of He could have bought three
automobiles if hed wanted to but he didnt want to And the reason he
didnt was named Tobias Loveland and lived over to Orham

I know Tobias interrupted Captain Bailey Stitt

Course you do continued Barzilla So does Sol I guess Well
anyhow Tobias and Capn Jonadab never did hitch When they was boys
together at school they was always rowin and fightin and when they
grew up to be thirty and courted the same girlten years younger than
either of em she wastwant much better Neither of em got her
as a matter of fact she married a tin peddler named Bassett over to
Hyannis But both callated they would have won if tother hadnt been
in the race and consequently they loved each other with a love that
passed understandin Tobias had got well to do in the cranberryraisin
line and drove a fast horse Jonadab durin the last prosperous year
or two had bought what he thought was some horse likewise They met
on the road one day last spring and trotted alongside one another for a
mile At the end of that mile Jonadabs crafts jib boom was just astern
of Tobiass rudder Inside of that week the Capn had swapped his horse
for one with a twothirty record and the next time they met Tobias was
left with a beautiful but dusty view of Jonadabs back hair So HE
bought a new horse And that was the beginnin

It went along that way for twelve months Fust one fellers nag would
come home freighted with perspiration and glory and then tothers One
week Jonadab would be so bloated with horse pride that he couldnt find
room for his vittles and the next hed be out in the stable growlin
cause it cost so much for hay to stuff an old hide rack that want
fit to put in a museum At last it got so that neither one could find a
better horse on the Cape and the two they had was practically an even
match I begun to have hopes that the foolishness was over And then the
tin peddlers widow drifts in to upset the whole calabash

She made port at Orham fust this Henrietta Bassett did and the style
she slung killed every female Goliath in the Orham sewin circle dead
Seems her husband that was had been an inventor as a sort of side line
to peddlin tinware and all to once he invented somethin that worked
He made moneynobody knew how much though all hands had a guessand
pretty soon afterwards he made a will and Henrietta a widow Shed been
livin in New York so she said and had come back to revisit the scenes
of her childhood She was a mighty wellpreserved womanartificial
preservatives I callate like some kinds of tomatter ketchupand her
comin stirred Orham way down to the burnt places on the bottom of the
kettle

I guess I remember HER too put in Captain Bailey

Say queried Mr Wingate snappishly do you want to tell about her
If you do why

Belay both of you ordered the depot master Heave ahead Barzilla

The news of her got over to Wellmouth and me and Jonadab heard of it
He was some subject to widowsmost widower men are I guessbut he
didnt develop no alarmin symptoms in this case and never even hinted
that hed like to see his old girl Fact is his newest horse trade had
showed that it was afraid of automobiles and he was beginnin to get
rabid along that line Then come that afternoon when him and me was out
drivin together and weWell Ill have to tell you about that

We was over on the long stretch of wood road between Trumet and
Denboro nice hard macadam the mareher name was Celia but Jonadab
had rechristened her Bay Queen after a boat he used to ownskimmin
along at a smooth easy gait when lo and behold you we rounds a turn
and there ahead of us is a light rubbertired wagon with a man and
woman on the seat of it I heard Jonadab give a kind of snort

Whats the matter says I

Nothin says he between his teeth Only if I aint some mistaken
thats Tobe Lovelands rig Wonder if hes got his spunk with him The
Queens feelin her oats today and I callate I can show him a few
things

Rubbish says I disgusted Dont be foolish Jonadab I dont know
nothin about his spunk but I do know theres a woman with him Taint
likely hell want to race you when hes got a passenger aboard

Oh I dont know says he Ive got you Barzilla so twill be two
and two Lets heave alongside and see

So he clucked to the Queen and in a jiffy we was astern of tother
rig Loveland looked back over his shoulder

Ugh he grunts bout as cordial as a plate of ice cream Lo
Wixon that you

Umhm begins Jonadab Hows that crowbait of yours today Tobe
Got any go in him Cause if he has I

He stopped short The woman in Lovelands carriage had turned her head
and was starin hard

Why she gasps I do believeWhy Jonadab

HETTIE says the Capn

Well after that twas pull up of course and shake hands and talk
The widow she done most of the talkin She was SO glad to see him How
had he been all these years She knew him instantly He hadnt changed
a mitethat is not so VERY much She was plannin to come over to the
Old Home House and stay a spell later on but now she was havin SUCH a
good time in Orham TobiasMr Lovelandwas makin it SO pleasant for
her She did enjoy drivin so much and Mr Loveland had the fastest
horse in the countydid we know that

Tobias and Jonadab glowered back and forth while all this gush was
bein turned loose and hardly spoke to one another But when twas over
and we was ready to start again the Capn says says he

Ill be mighty glad to see you over to the hotel when youre ready to
come Hettie I can take you ridin too Furs horse goes Ive got a
pretty good one myself

Oh squeals the widow Really Is that him Its awful pretty and
he looks fast

She is says Jonadab Theres nothin round here can beat her

Humph says Loveland Git dap

Git dap says Jonadab agreein with him for once

Tobias started and we started Tobias makes his horse go a little
faster and Jonadab speeded up some likewise I see how twas goin to
be and therefore I want surprised to death when the next ten minutes
found us sizzlin down that road neck and neck with Loveland dust
flyin hoofs poundin and the two drivers leanin way forard over
the dash reins gripped and teeth sot For a little ways twas an even
thing and then we commenced to pull ahead a little

Loveland yells Jonadab out of the port corner of his mouth if
I aint showin you my tailboard by the time we pass the fust house in
Denboro Ill eat my Sunday hat

I callate he would a beat too We was drawin ahead all the time
and had a threequarter length lead when we swung clear of the woods and
sighted Denboro village quarter of a mile away And up the road comes
flyin a big auto goin to beat the cars

Lets forget the next few minutes they want pleasant ones for me
Soons the Bay Queen sot eyes on that auto she stopped trottin and
commenced to hop from hoppin she changed to waltzin and high jumpin
When the smoke had cleared the auto was out of sight and we was in the
bushes alongside the road with the Queen just gettin ready to climb
a tree As for Tobias and Henrietta they was roundin the turn by the
fust house in Denboro wavin bybys to us over the back of the seat

We went home then and every foot of the way Capn Jonadab called an
automobile a new kind of name and none complimentary The boarders
they got wind of what had happened and begun to rag him and the more
they ragged the madder he got and the more down on autos

And to put a head on the whole business Im blessed if Tobias
Loveland didnt get in with an automobile agent who was stoppin in
Orham and buy a fifteenhundreddollar machine off him And the very
next time Jonadab was out with the Queen on the Denboro road Tobias
and the widow whizzed past him in that car so fast he might as well have
been hove to And by way of rubbin it in they come along back pretty
soon and rolled alongside of him easy while Henrietta gushed about Mr
Lovelands beautiful car and how nice it was to be able to go just as
swift as you wanted to Jonadab couldnt answer back nuther bein too
busy keepin the Queen from turnin herself into a flyin machine

Twas then that he got himself swore in special constable to arrest
auto drivers for overspeedin and for days he wandered round layin for
a chance to haul up Tobias and get him fined Hed have had plenty of
game if hed been satisfied with strangers but he didnt want them
anyhow and besides most of em was on their way to spend money at the
Old Home House Twould have been poor business to let any of THAT cash
go for fines and he realized it

Twas in early June only a few weeks ago that the widow come to our
hotel I never thought she meant it when she said she was comin and so
I didnt expect her Fact is I was expectin to hear that she and Tobe
Loveland was married or engaged But there was a slip up somewheres for
all to once the depot wagon brings her to the Old Home House she hires
a room and settles down to stay till the season closed which would be
in about a fortnt

From the very fust she played her cards for Jonadab He meant to be
middlin average frosty to her I imagineher bein so thick with
Tobias prejudiced him I presume likely But land sakes she thawed
him out like hot toddy thaws out some folks tongues She never took no
notice of his coldness but smiled and gushed and flattered and looked
her prettiestwhich was moren average considerin her ageand by the
end of the third day he was hangin round her like a cat round a cook

It commenced to look serious to me Jonadab was a pretty old fish to
be caught with soft soap and a set of false crimps but you cant
never tell When them old kind do bite they genrally swallow hook and
sinker and he sartinly did act hungry I wished moren once that Peter
T Brown our business manager was aboard to help me with advice but
Peter is off tourin the Yosemite with his wife and her relations so
whatever pilotin there was I had to do And every day fetched Jonadabs
bows nigher the matrimonial rocks

Id about made up my mind to sound the fog horn by askin him straight
out what he was callatin to do but somethin I heard one evenin as
I set alone in the hotel office made me think Id better wait a spell

The office window was open and the curtain drawed down tight I was
settin inside smokin and goin over the situation when footsteps
sounded on the piazza and a couple come to anchor on the settee right by
that window Capn Jonadab and Henrietta I sensed that immediate

She was laughin and actin kind of queer and he was talkin mighty
earnest

Oh no Capn Oh no she giggles You mustnt be so serious on
such a beautiful night as this Lets talk about the moon

Drat the moon says Jonadab Hettie I

Oh just see how beautiful the water looks All shiny and

Drat the water too Hettie whats the reason you dont want to talk
serious with me If that Tobe Loveland

Really I dont see why you bring Mr Lovelands name into the
conversation He is a perfect gentleman generous and kind and as for
the way in which he runs that lovely car of his

The Capn interrupted her He ripped out somethin emphatic

Generous he snarls Bout as generous as a hog in the feed trough
he is And as for runnin that pesky auto if Id demean myself to own
one of them things Ill bet my other suit I could run it bettern he
does If I couldnt Id tie myself to the anchor and jump overboard

The way she answered showed pretty plain that she didnt believe him
Really she says Do you think so Good night Jonadab

I could hear her walkin off acrost the piazza He went after her
Hettie he says you answer me one thing Are you engaged to Tobe
Loveland

She laughed again sort of teasin and slow Really says she you
areWhy no Im not

That was all but it set me to thinkin hard She want engaged to
Loveland she said so herself And yet if she wanted Jonadab she was
actin mighty funny I aint had no experience but it seemed to me that
then was the time to bag him and shed put him off on purpose She was
ages too ancient to be a flirt for the fun of it What was her game




CHAPTER X

CAPTAIN JONADAB GOES


Mr Wingate stopped and roared a greeting to Captain Hiram Baker who
was passing the open door of the waiting room

Hello there Hime he shouted Come up in here What are you too
proud to speak to common folks

Captain Hiram entered Hello he said You look like a busy gang for
sure What you doinseatin chairs

Just now were automobilin observed Captain Sol Set down Hiram

Automobilin repeated the new arrival evidently puzzled

Sartin Barzillas takin us out Go on Barzilla

Mr Wingate smiled broadly Well he began we HAVE just about
reached the part where I went autoin The widow and me and Jonadab

Jonadab shouted Stitt I thought you said

I know what I said But we went auto ridin just the same

Twas Henry G Bradbury that took us out him and his brannew big
tourin car You see he landed to board with us the next day after
Henrietta comethis Henry G didand he was so quiet and easy spoken
and run his car so slow that even a pizen auto hater like Jonadab
couldnt take much offense at him He want very well he said subject
to some kind of heart attacks and had come to the Old Home for rest

Him and the Capn had great arguments about the sins of automobilin
Jonadab was sot on the idee that nine folks out of ten hadnt machine
sense enough to run a car Bradbury he declared that that was a fact
with the majority of autos but not with his Why a child could run
it says he Look here Capn To start it you just do this To stop
it you do so and so To make her go slow you haul back on this lever To
make her go faster you shove down this one And as for steerinwell
a man thats handled the wheels of as many catboats as you have would
simply have a picnic Im in entire sympathy with your feelins against
speeders and suchId be a constable if I was in your shoesbut this
is a gentlemans car and runs like one

All Jonadab said was Bosh and Humph but he couldnt help actin
interested particular as Mrs Bassett kept him alongside of the machine
and was so turrible interested herself And when this particlar
afternoon Henry G invites us all to go out with him for a little roll
around the widow was so tickled and insisted so that he just HAD to
go he didnt dast say no

Somehow or notherI aint just sure yet how it happenedthe seatin
arrangements was made like this Jonadab and Bradbury on the front seat
and me and Henrietta in the stuffed cockpit astern We rolled out and
purred along the road smooth as a cat trottin to dinner No speedin
no joltin no nothin TWAS a gentlemans car there want no doubt
about that

We went way over to Bayport and Orham and beyond And all the time
Bradbury kept pintin out the diffrent levers to Jonadab and tellin
him how to work em Finally after wed headed back he asked Jonadab
to take the wheel and steer her a spell Said his heart was feelin sort
of mean and twould do him good to rest

Jonadab said no emphatic and moren average ugly but Henry G kept
beggin and pleadin and pretty soon the widow put in her oar He must
do it to please her He had SAID he could do ithad told her soand
now he must make good Why when Mr Loveland

All right snarls Jonadab Ill try But if ever

Hold on says I Heres where I get out

However they wouldnt let me and the Capn took the wheel His jaw
was set and his hands shakin but he done it Hettie had give her
orders and she was skipper

For a considerble spell we just crawled Jonadab was steerin less
crooked every minute and it tickled him you could see that

Answers her hellum tiptop dont she he says

Bet your life says Bradbury Better put on a little more speed
hadnt we

He put it on himself afore the new pilot could stop him and we
commenced to move

When you want to make her jump he says you press down on that with
your foot and you shove the spark back

Shut up howls Jonadab Belay Dont you dast to touch that Im
scart to death as tis Here you take this wheel

But he wouldnt and we went on at a good clip For a green hand the
Capn was leavin a pretty straight wake

Gosh he says after a spell I blieve Im kind of gettin the hang
of the craft

Course you are says Bradbury I toldOh

He straightens up grabs at his vest and slumps down against the back
of the seat

What IS it screams the widow Oh what IS it Mr Bradbury

He answers plucky but tolerble faintlike My heart he gasps
IIm afraid Im goin to have one of my attacks I must get to a
doctor quick

Doctor I sings out Great land of love there aint a doctor nigher
than Denboro and thats four mile astern

Never mind cries the Bassett woman We must go there then Turn
around Jonadab Turn around at once Mr Bradbury

But poor Henry G was curled up against the cushions and we couldnt
get nothin out of him but groans And all the time we was sailin along
up the road

Turn around Jonadab orders Henrietta Turn around and go for the
doctor

Jonadabs hands was clutched on that wheel and his face was white as
his rubber collar

Jerushy he groans desperate II dont know HOW to turn around

Then stop you foolhead I bellers Stop where you be

And he moansalmost cryin he was IIve forgotten how to STOP

Talk about your situations If we want in one then I miss my guess
Every minute we was sinkin Denboro below the horizon

We MUST get to a doctor says the widow Where is there another one
Mr Wingate

The next ones in Bayport says I and thats ten mile ahead if its
a foot

However there want nothin else for it so toward Bayport we put
Bradbury groaned once in a while and Mrs Bassett got nervous

Well never get there at this rate says she Go faster Jonadab
Faster Press down onon that thing he told you to Please for MY
sake

Dont you I begun but twas too late He pressed and away we
went We was eatin up the road now I tell you and though I was
expectin every minute to be my next I couldnt help admirin the way
the Capn steered And as for him he was gettin more and more set up
and confident

She handles like a yacht Barzilla he grunts between his teeth
See me put her around the next buoy ahead there Hey hows that

The next buoy was a curve in the road and we went around it
beautiful So with the next and the next and the next Bayport want so
very fur ahead All to once another dreadful thought struck me

Look here I yells How in time are we goin to stop when weOW

The Bassett woman had pinched my arm somethin savage I looked at her
and she was scowlin and shakin her head

Sshsh she whispers Dont disturb him Hell be frightened and

Frightened Good heavens to Betsy I callate he wont be the only one
thats fri

But she looked so ugly that I shut up prompt though I done a heap of
thinkin On we went and as we turned the next buoy there ahead of
us was another auto somethin like ours with only one person in it a
man and goin in the same direction we was though not quite so fast

Then I WAS scart Hi Jonadab I sings out Heave to Come about
Shorten sail Do you want to run him down Look OUT

I might as well have saved my breath Heavin to and the rest of it
want included in our pilots education On we went same as ever I
dont know what might have happened if the widow hadnt kept her head
She leaned over the forard rail of the after cockpit and squeezed a
rubber bag that was close to Jonadabs starboard arm It was jined to
the fog whistle I callate cause from under our bows sounded a beller
like a bull afoul of a barbwire fence

The feller in tother car turned his head and looked Then he commenced
to sheer off to windard sos to let us pass But all the time he kept
lookin back and starin and as we got nigher and I could see him
plainer through the dust he looked more and more familiar Twas
somebody I knew

Then I heard a little grunt or gasp from Capn Jonadab He was
leanin forard over the wheel starin at the man in the other auto
The nigher we got the harder he stared and the man in front was
actin similar in regards to him And all to once the head car stopped
swingin off to windard turned back toward the middle of the road and
begun to go like smoke The next instant I felt our machine fairly jump
beneath me I looked at Jonadabs foot Twas pressed hard down on the
speed lever

You crazy loon I screeched YouyouyouStop it Take your foot
off that Do you want to

I was climbin over the back of the front seat my knee pretty nigh on
Bradburys head But would you believe it that Jonadab man let go of
the wheel with one handlet GO of it mind youand give me a shove
that sent me backward in Henrietta Bassetts lap

Barzilla he growled between his teeth you set where you be
and keep off the quarterdeck Im runnin this craft Ill beat that
Loveland this time or run him under one or tother

As sure as Im alive this minute the man in the front car was Tobias
Loveland

And from then onDont talk I dream about it nights and wake up with
my arms around the bedpost I aint real sure but I kind of have an
idee that the bedpost business comes from the fact that I was huggin
the widow some of the time If I did twant knowinly and she never
mentioned it afterwards All I can swear to is clouds of dust and horns
honkin and telegraph poles lookin like teeth in a comb and Jonadabs
face set as the Day of Judgment

He kept his foot down on the speed place as if twas glued He shoved
the sparkwhatever that isway back Every once in a while he
yelled yelled at the top of his lungs What he yelled hadnt no sense
to it Sometimes youd think that he was drivin a horse and next that
he was handlin a schooner in a gale

Git dap hed whoop Go it you cripples Keep her nose right in the
teeth of it Shes got the best of the water so let her bile WheEE

We didnt stop at Bayport Our skipper had made other arrangements
However the way I figgered it we was long past needin a doctor and
you can get an undertaker most anywhere We went through the village
like a couple of shootin stars Tobias about a length ahead his hat
blowed off his hairwhat little hes gotstreamin out behind and
that blessed red buzz wagon of his fairly skimmin the hummocks and
jumpin the smooth places And right astern of him comes Jonadab
hangin to the wheel HIS hat gone his mouth open and fillin the dust
with yells and coughs

You could see folks runnin to doors and front gates but you never saw
em reach where they was gointime they done that we was somewheres
round the next bend A pullet run over us onceyes I mean just that
She clawed the top of the widows bunnit as we slid underneath her and
by the time she lit we was so fur away she want visible to the
naked eye Bradburywhod got better remarkable suddenwas pawin at
Jonadabs arm tryin to make him ease up but he might as well have
pawed the wind As for Henrietta Bassett she was acrost the back of the
front seat tootin the horn for all she was wuth And curled down in a
heap on the cockpit floor was a fleshy seafarin person by the name of
Barzilla Wingate sufferin from chills and fever

I think twas on the long stretch of the Trumet road that we beat
Tobias I know we passed somethin then though just what I aint
competent to testify All Im sure of is that tother side of Bayport
village the landscape got some less streaked and you could most
genrally separate one house from the next

Bradbury looked at Henrietta and smiled a sort of sickly smile She
was pretty pale but she managed to smile back I got up off the floor
and slumped on the cushions As for Capn Jonadab Wixon hed stopped
yellin but his face was one broad serene grin His mouth through
the dust and the dirt caked around it looked like a rain gully in a
sandbank And occasional he crowed hoarse but vainglorious

Did you see me he barked Did you notice me lick him Hell laugh
at me will hehim and his onehorse tin cart Ho HO Why youd
think he was settin down to rest Ive got him where I want him now
Ho ho Say Henrietta did you go swift as you Land sakes Mr
Bradbury I forgot all about you And II guess we must have got a good
ways past the doctors place

Bradbury said never mind He felt much better and he callated hed do
till we fetched the Old Home dock Hed take the wheel now he guessed

But would you blieve it that fool Jonadab wouldnt let him He was
used to the ship now he said and if twas all the same to Henry G
and Hettie hed kind of like to run her into port

She answers her hellum fine he says After a little practice I
callate I could steer

Steer sings out Bradbury STEER Great Caesars ghost I give you
my word Capn Wixon I never saw such handlin of a machine as you did
goin through Bayport in my life Youre a wonder

Umhm says Jonadab contented Ive steered a good many vessels in
my time through traffic and amongst the shoals and never run afoul
of nothin yet I dont see much diffrence on shorecept that its a
little easier

EASIER Wouldnt thatWell whats the use of talkin

We got to the Old Home House safe and sound Jonadab actin under
Bradburys orders run her into the yard slowin up and stoppin at
the front steps slick as grease He got out his chest swelled up like
a puffin pig and went struttin in to tell everybody what hed done to
Loveland I dont know where Bradbury and the widow went As for me I
went aloft and turned in And twas two days and nights afore I got up
again I had a cold anyway and what Id been through didnt help it
none

The afternoon of the second day Bradbury come up to see me He was
dressed in his city clothes and looked as if he was goin away Sure
enough he was goin on the next train

Wheres Jonadab says I

Oh hes out in his car he says Huntin for Loveland again
maybe

HIS car You mean yours

No I mean his I sold my car to him yesterday mornin for twentyfive
hundred dollars cash

I set up in bed Go long I sings out You didnt nuther

Yes I did Sure thing After that ride you couldnt have separated
him from that machine with blastin powder He paid over the money like
a little man

I laid down again Jonadab Wixon payin twentyfive hundred dollars for
a plaything Not promisin but actually PAYIN it

Hashas the widow gone with him I asked soons I could get my
breath

He laughed sort of queer No he says shes gone out of town for
a few days Ha ha Well between you and me Wingate I doubt if
she comes back again She and I have made all were likely to in this
neighborhood and shes too good a business woman to waste her time
Goodby glad to have met you

But I smelt rat strong and wouldnt let him go without seein the
critter

Hold on I says Theres somethin underneath all this Out with it
I wont let on to the Capn if you dont want me to

Well says he laughin again Mrs Bassett WONT come back and
I know it She and I have sold four cars on the Cape in the last five
weeks and the profitsll moren pay vacation expenses Two up in
Wareham one over in Orham to Loveland

Did YOU sell Tobias his I asks settin up again

Hettie and I didyes Soons we landed him we come over to bag old
Wixon I thought one time hed kill us before we got him but he didnt
How he did run that thing Hes a game sport

See here says I YOU and Hettie soldWhat do you mean by that

Mrs Bassett is my backer in the auto business says he She put in
her money and I furnished the experience Weve got a big plant up in
namin a city in Connecticut

I fetched a long breath WELL says I And all this makin eyes at
Tobe and Jonadab was justjust

Just bait thats all says he I told you she was a good business
woman

I let this sink in good Then says I Humph I swan to man And hows
your heart actin now

Fine he says winkin I had that attack sos the Capn would learn
to run on his own hook I didnt expect quite so much of a run but
Im satisfied Dont you worry about my heart disease That twentyfive
hundred cured it Twas all in the way of business says Henry G
Bradbury

Whew whistled Captain Hiram as Barzilla reached into his pocket for
pipe and tobacco Whew I should say your partner had a narrer escape
Want to look out sharp for widders Theyre dangerous hey Sol

The depot master did not answer Captain Hiram asked another question
Howd Jonadab take Hetties leavin he inquired

Oh said Barzilla I dont think he minded so much He was too crazy
about his new auto to care for anything else Then too he was bilin
mad cause Loveland swore out a warrant against him for speedin

Nice trick aint it he says I knew Tobe was a poor loser but
I didnt think hed be so low down as all that Says I was goin fifty
mile an hour He he Well I WAS movin thats a fact I dont care
Twas wuth the twentydollar fine

Maybe so I says but twont look very pretty to have a special
auto constable hauled up and fined for breakin the law hes sposed to
protect

He hadnt thought of that His face clouded over

No use Barzilla says he Ill have to give it up

Guess you will says I Automobilin is

I dont mean automobilin he snorts disgusted Course not I mean
bein constable

So there you are From cussin automobiles hes got so that he cant
talk enough good about em And every day sence then hes out on the
road layin for another chance at Tobias I hope he gets that chance
pretty soon becausewell theres a rumor goin round that Loveland is
plannin to swap his car for a bigger and faster one If he does   

If he does interrupted Captain Sol I hope youll fix the next race
for over here Id like to see you go by Barzilla

Guess youd have to look quick to see him laughed Stitt Speakin
about automobiles

By gum ejaculated Wingate youd have to look somewheres else to
find ME Ive got all the auto racin I want

Speakin of automobiles began Captain Bailey again No one paid the
slightest attention

Hows Dusenberry your baby Hiram asked the depot master turning to
Captain Baker His birthdays the Fourth and thats only a couple of
days off

The proud parent grinned then looked troubled

Why he aint real fustrate he said Seems to be some under
the weather Got a cold and kind of sore throat Dr Parker says he
callates its a touch of tonsilitis Theres considerble fever too
I was hopin the doctord come again today but hes gone away on
a fishin cruise Wont be home till late tomorrer I spose me and
Sophrony hadnt ought to worry Dr Parker seems to know about the
case

Humph grunted the depot master theres only two beins in creation
that know it all Ones the Almighty and tothers young Parker Hes
right out of medical school and is just as fresh as his diploma He
hadnt any business to go fishin and leave his patients We lost a
good man when old Dr Ryder died He    Oh well you mustnt
worry Hiram Dusenberryll pull out in time for his birthday Goin to
celebrate was you

Captain Baker nodded Umhm he said Sophronys goin to bake a
frosted cake and stick three candles on ithes three year old you
knowand Ive made him a twuly boat with sails thats what hes been
beggin for Ho ho hes the cutest little shaver

Speakin of automobiles began Bailey Stitt for the third time

That youngster of yours Hiram went on the depot master is the
right kind Compared with some of the summer young ones that strike this
depot hes a saint

Captain Hiram grinned Thats what I tell Sophrony he said
Sometimes when Dusenberry gets to cuttin up and she is sort of
provoked I say to her Old lady I say if you think THATS a
naughty boy you ought to have seen Archibald

Who was Archibald asked Barzilla

He was a young rip that Sim Phinney and I run across four years ago
when we went on our New York cruise together The weir business had been
pretty good and Sim had been teasin me to go on a vacation with him so
I went Sim aint stopped talkin about our experiences yet Ho ho

You bet he aint laughed the depot master One mixup you had with
a priest and a love story and land knows what He talks about that to
this day

What was it He never told me said Wingate

Why it begun at the Golconda House the hotel where Sim and I was
stayin We

Did YOU put up at the Golconda interrupted Barzilla Why Capn
Jonadab and me stayed there when we went to New York

I know you did Jonadab recommended it to Sim and Sim took the
recommendation That Golconda House is the only grudge Ive got against
Jonadab Wixon It sartin is a tough old tavern

I give in to that Jonadabs so sot on it account of havin stopped
there on his honeymoon years and years ago Hes too stubborn to
own its bad Its a matter of principle with him and hes sot on
principle

Yes continued Baker Well Sim and me had been at that Golconda
three days and nights Mornin of the fourth day we walked out of the
dinin room after breakfast feelin pretty average chipper Gettin
safe past another meal at that hotel was enough of itself to make a chap
grateful

We walked out of the dinin room and into the office And there by the
clerks desk was a big tall man dressed up in clothes that was loud
enough to speak for themselves and with a shiny new tall hat set with
a list to port on his head He was smoothfaced and pugnosed with an
upper lip like a camels

He didnt pay much attention to us nor to anybody else for the matter
of that He was as mournful as a hearse for all his joyful togs

Fine day aint it says Sim social

The tall chap looked up at him from under the deck of the beaver hat

Huh he growls out and looks down again

I say its a fine day said Phinney again

I was after hearin yez say it says the man and walks off scowlin
like a meat ax We looked after him

Who was that murderer asks Sim of the clerk And when are they
going to hang him

Sshsh whispers the clerk scart Tis the boss The bloke what
runs the hotel Hes a fine man but he has troubles Hes blue

So thats the boss hey says I And hes blue Well he looks it
Whats troublin him Aint business good

Never better It aint that He has things on his mind You see

I callate hed have told us the yarn only Sim wouldnt wait to hear
it We was goin sightseein and we had aquarium and Stock Exchange
on the list for that afternoon The hotel clerk had made out a kind of
schedule for us of things wed ought to see while we was in New York
and so fur wed took in the zoological menagerie and the picture museum
and Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge

On the way downtown in the elevated railroad Sim done some preachin
His text was took from the Golconda House sign which had T Dempsey
Proprietor painted on it

Its that Dempsey mans conscience that makes him so blue Hiram
says Sim Its the way he makes his money He sells liquor

Oh says I Is THAT it I thought maybe hed been sleepin on one
of his own hotel beds THEYRE enough to make any man blueblack and
blue

The aquarium want a success Phinney was disgusted He give one
look around grabbed me by the arm and marched me out of that building
same as Deacon Titcomb of the Holiness Church at Denboro marched his
boy out of the Universalist sociable

Its nothin but a whole passel of fish he snorts The idea of
sendin two Cape Codders a couple of miles to look at FISH Ive looked
at em and fished for em and et em all the days of my life he says
and when Im on a vacation I want a change Id forgot that aquarium
meant fish or you wouldnt have got me within smellin distance of
it Necessitys one thing and pleasures another as the boy said about
takin his mas spring bitters

So we headed for the Stock Exchange We got our gallery tickets at the
bank where the Golconda folks kept money and in a little while we was
leanin over a kind of marble bulwarks and starin down at a gang of men
smokin and foolin and carryin on Twas a dull day so we found out
afterward and I guess likely that was true Anyway I never see such
grownup men act so much like children There was a lot of poles stuck
up around with signs on em and around every pole was a circle of
bedlamites hollerin like loons Hollerin was the nighest to work
of anything I see them fellers do unless twas tearin up papers and
shovin the pieces down somebodys neck or throwin em in the air like
a playactin snowstorm

Whats the matter with em says I High finance taken away their
brains

But Phinney was awful interested He dumped some money in a mine once
The mine caved in on it I guess for not a red cent ever come to the
top again but hes been a kind of prophet concernin finances ever
sence

I want to see the big fellers says he Spose that fat one is
Morgan

I dont know says I Me and Pierpont aint met for ever so long
Dont lean over and point so youre makin a hit

He was too Some of the younger crew on the floor was lookin up and
grinnin and more kept stoppin and joinin in all the time I callate
we looked kind of green and soft hangin over that marble rail like
posies on a tombstone and green is the favorite color to a stockbroker
they tell me Anyhow we had a goodsized congregation under us in
less than no time Likewise they got chatty and commenced to unload
remarks

Land sakes says one Hows punkins

Hows crops down your way says another

Now there want nothin real bright and funny about these
questionsmore fresh than new they struck mebut youd think they
was gems from the comic almanac jedgin by the hawhaws Next minute
a little baldheaded smart Alec with clothes that had a tailors sign
hull down and out of the race steps to the front and commences to make
a speech

Gosh tmighty gents says he With your kind permission Ill sing
When Reuben Comes to Town

And he did sing it too in a voice that needed cultivatin worsen
a sandy front yard And with every verse the congregation whooped and
laughed and cheered When the anthem was concluded all hands set up a
yell and looked at us to see how we took it

As for me I was bilin mad and mortified and redhot all over But Sim
Phinney was as cool as an October evenin Once in a while old Sim
comes out right down brilliant and he done it now He smiled kind
of tolerant and easy same as you might at the tricks of a handorgan
monkey Then he claps his hands applaudin like reaches into his
pocket brings up a couple of pennies and tosses em down to little
baldhead who was standin there blown up with pride

For a minute the crowd was still And THEN such a yell as went up The
whole floor went wild Next thing I knew the gallery was filled with
brokers grabbin us by the hands poundin us on the back beggin us
to come have a drink and generally goin crazy We was solid with the
system for once in our lives We could have had that whole buildin
from marble decks to gold maintruck if wed said the word Fifty
yellin lunatics was on hand to give it to us the other two hundred was
joyfully mutilatin the baldhead

Well I wanted to get away and so did Sim I guess but the crowd
wouldnt let us Wed got to have a drink hogsheads of drinks That was
the best joke on Eddie Lewisburg that ever was Come on We MUST come
on Whee Wow

I dont know how it would have ended if some one hadnt butted head
first through the mob and grabbed me by the shoulder I was ready to
fight by this time and maybe Id have begun to fight if the chap who
grabbed me hadnt been a few inches short of seven foot high And
besides that I knew him Twas Sam Holden a young feller I knew when
he boarded here one summer His wife boarded here too only she want
his wife then Her name was Grace Hargrave and she was a fine girl
Maybe you remember em Sol

The depot master nodded

I remember em well he said Liked em botheverybody did

Yes Well he knew us and was glad to see us

It IS you he sings out By George I thought it was when I came on
the floor just now My but Im glad to see you And Mr Phinney too
Bully Clear out and let em alone you Indians

The crowd didnt want to let us alone but Sam got us clear somehow
and out of the Exchange Buildin and into the back room of a kind of
restaurant Then he gets chairs for us orders cigars and shakes hands
once more

To think of seein you two in New York he says wonderin What are
you doin here When did you come Tell us about it

So we told him about our pleasure cruise and what had happened to us
so fur It seemed to tickle him most to death

Grace and I are keepin house in a modest way uptown says Sam
and shell be as glad to see you as I am Youre comin up to dinner
with me tonight and youre goin to make us a visit you know he
says

Well if we didnt know it then we learned it right away Nothin
that me or Simeon could say would make him change the course a point So
Phinney went up to the Golconda House and got our bags and at halfpast
four that afternoon the three of us was in a hired hack bound uptown

On the way Sam was full of fun as ever He laughed and joked and asked
questions about East Harniss till you couldnt rest All of a sudden he
slaps his knee and sings out

There I knew Id forgotten somethin Our butler left yesterday
and I was to call at the intelligence office on my way home and see if
theyd scared up a new one

I looked at Simeon and he at me

Hum says I thinkin about that modest housekeepin Do you keep
a butler

Not long says he dry as a salt codfish And thats all we could get
out of him

I spose theres different kinds of modesty We hadnt moren got
inside the goldplated front door of that house when I decided that the
Holden brand of housekeepin want bashful enough to blush If ID been
runnin that kind of a place the only time Id felt shy and retirin
was when the landlord came for the rent

One of the fomast handshired girls I meanwent aloft to fetch Mrs
Holden and when Grace came down she was just as nice and folksy and
glad to see us as a body could be But she looked sort of troubled just
the same

Im ever so glad youre here says she to me and Simeon But oh
Sam its a shame the way things happen Cousin Harriet and Archie came
this afternoon to stay until tomorrow Theyre on their way South
And I have promised that you and I shall take Harriet to see Marlowe
tonight Of course we wont do it now under any consideration but you
know what she is

Sam seemed to know He muttered somethin that sounded like a Scripture
text Simeon spoke up prompt

Indeed you will says he decided Me and Hiram aint that kind
Weve got relations of our own and we know what it means when they
come avisitin You and Mr Holdenll take your compny and go to
seewhatever tis you want to see and well make ourselves to home
till you get back Yes you will or we clear out this minute

They didnt want to but we was sot and so they give in finally It
seemed that this Cousin Harriet was a widow relation of the Holdens who
lived in a swell country house over in Connecticut somewhere and was
rich as the rest of the tribe Archie was her son Hers and the Evil
Ones Sam said

We didnt realize how much truth there was in this last part until we
run afoul of Archie and his ma at dinner time Cousin Harriet was tall
and middlin slim thirtyfive years old maybe at a sale for
taxes but discounted to twenty at her own valuation She was got up
regardless and had a kind of chronic tired way of talkin and a
condescendin look to her as if she was on top of Bunker Hill monument
and all creation was on its knees down below She didnt warm up to
Simeon and me much eyed us over through a pair of gilt spyglasses and
admitted that she was charmed Im sure Likewise she was afflicted
with nerves which must be a divil of a diseasefor everybody but the
patient especial

Archiehis ma hailed him as Archibald dearshowed up pretty
soon in tow of his maid a sweetfaced tiredout Irish girl named
Margaret Archibald dear was five years old or so sufferin from
curls and the lack of a lickin I never see a young one that needed a
strap ile more

How dye do Archie says Simeon holdin out his hand

Archie didnt take the hand Instead of that he points at Phinney and
commences to laugh

Ho ho says he dancin and pointin Look at the funny whiskers

Sim want expectin that and it set him all aback like hed run into
a head squall He took hold of his beard and looked foolish Sam and
Grace looked ashamed and mad Cousin Harriet laughed one of her lazy
laughs

Archibald dear she drawls you mustnt speak that way Now be
nice and play with Margaret durin dinner thats a good boy

I wont remarks Archie cheerful Im goin to dine with you
mama

Oh no youre not dear Youll have your own little table and

Then twas Hi yi Bow wow Archibald want hankerin for little
tables He was goin to eat with us thats what His ma she argued
with him and pleaded and he yelled and stamped and hurrahed When
Margaret tried to soothe him he went at her like a wildcat and kicked
and pounded her sinful She tried to take him out of the room and then
Cousin Harriet come down on her like a scow load of brick

Havent I told you says she sharp and vinegary not to oppose the
child in that way Archibald has such a sensitive nature she says to
Grace that opposition arouses him just as it did me at his age Very
well dear you MAY dine with us tonight if you wish Oh my poor
nerves Margaret why dont you place a chair for Master Archibald The
creature is absolutely stupid at times she says talkin about that
poor maid afore her face with no more thought for her feelins than
if she was a wooden image She has no tact whatever I wouldnt have
Archibalds spirit broken for anything

Twas his neck that needed breakin if you asked ME That was a joyful
meal now I tell you

There was more joy when twas over Archie didnt want to go to bed
havin desires to set up and torment Simeon with questions about his
whiskers askin if they growed or was tied on and things like that
Course he didnt know his ma was goin to the show or he wouldnt have
let her But finally he was coaxed upstairs by Margaret and a box of
candy and word havin been sent down that he was asleep Sam got
out his plug hat and Grace and Cousin Harriet got on their furlined
dolmans and knit clouds and was ready for the hack

I feel mighty mean to go off and leave you this way says Sam to
me and Simeon But you make yourself at home wont you This is your
house tonight you know servants and all

How about that boys wakin up says I

Oh his maidll attend to him If she needs any help you can give it
to her he says winkin on the side

But Cousin Harriet was right at his starboard beam and she heard him
She flew up like a settin hen

Indeed they will NOT she sings out If anyone but Margaret was to
attempt to control Archibald I dont dare think what might happen
I shall not stir from this spot until these persons promise not to
interfere in ANY way Archibald dear is such a sensitive child

So we promised not to interfere although Sim Phinney looked
disappointed when he done it I could see that hed had hopes afore he
give that promise




CHAPTER XI

IN THE GREAT METROPOLIS


So they left you and Sim Phinney to keep house did they Hiram
observed Wingate

They did And for a spell we figgered on bein free from too much
style

After theyd gone we loafed into the settin room or librry or
whatever you call it and come to anchor in a couple of big lazy chairs

Now says I takin off my coat we can be comftable

But we couldnt In bobs a servant girl to know if we wanted
anything We didnt but she looked so shocked when she see me in my
shirt sleeves that I put the coat on again feelin as if Id ought
to blush And in a minute back she comes to find out if we was SURE we
didnt want anything Sim was hitchin in his chair Between nerves
and Archibald his temper was raw on the edges

Say he bursts out you look kind of pale to me What you need is
fresh air Why dont you go take a walk

The girl looked at him with her mouth open

Oh says she I couldnt do that thank you sir That would leave
no one but the cook and the kitchen girl And the master said you was to
be made perfectly comftable and

Yes says Sim dry I heard him say it And we cant be comftable
with you shut up in the house this nice evenin Go and take a walk and
take the cook and stewardess with you Dont argue about it Im skipper
here till the boss gets back Go the three of you and go NOW Dye
hear

There was a little more talk but not much In five minutes or so the
downstairs front door banged and there was gigglin outside

There says Simeon peelin off HIS coat and throwin himself back in
one chair with his feet on another one Now by Judas Im goin to be
homey and happy like poor folks I dont wonder that Harriet womans got
nerves Darn style anyhow Pass over that cigar box Hiram

Twas half an hour later or so when Margaret the nursemaid came
downstairs Id almost forgot her We was tame and tolerble contented
by that time Phinney called to her as she went by the door

Is that young one asleep he asked

Yes sir says she he is Is there anything I can do Did you want
anything

Simeon looks at me I swan to man its catchin he says Theyve
all got it No we dont want anything exceptWhats the matter YOU
dont need fresh air do you

The girl looked as if shed lost her last friend Her pretty face was
pale and her eyes was wet as if shed been cryin

No sir says she puzzled No sir thank you sir

Shes tired out thats all says I I swan I pitied the poor thing
You go somewheres and take a nap I told her Me and my friend wont
tell

Oh no she couldnt do that It want that she was tiredno more
tired than usualbut shed been that troubled in her mind lately
askin our pardon that she was near to crazy

We was sorry for that but it didnt seem to be none of our business
and she was turnin away when all at once she stops and turns back
again

Might I ask you gintlemen a question she says sort of pleadin
Sure I mane no harm by it Do aither of you know a man be the name of
Michael OShaughnessy

Me and Sim looked at each other Which says I Mike O who says
Simeon

Aw dont you know him she begs DONT you know him Sure I hoped
you might If youd only tell me where he is Id git on me knees and
pray for you O Mike Mike why did you leave me like this Whatll
become of me

And she walks off down the hall coverin her face with her hands and
cryin as if her heart was broke

There there says Simeon runnin after her all shook up Hes a
kindhearted manespecially to nicelookin females Dont act so he
says Be a good girl Come right back into the settin room and tell
me all about it Me and Capn Baker aint got nerves and we aint rich
neither You can talk to us Come come

She didnt know how to act seemingly She was like a dog thats been
kicked so often hes suspicious of a pat on the head And she was cryin
and sobbin so and askin our pardon for doin it that it took a good
while to get at the real yarn But we did get it after a spell

It seems that the girlher whole name was Margaret Sullivanhad
been in this country but a month or so havin come from Ireland in a
steamboat to meet the feller whod kept compny with her over there His
name was Michael OShaughnessy and hed been in America for four years
or more livin with a cousin in Long Island City And hed got a good
job at last and he sent for her to come on and be married to him
And when she landed twas the cousin that met her Mike had drawn a
fivethousanddollar prize in the Mexican lottery a week afore and
hadnt been seen sence

So poor Margaret goes to the cousins to stay And she found them poor
as Jobs pet chicken and havin hardly grub enough aboard to feed the
dozen or so little cousins let alone free boarders like her And so
havin no money she goes out one day to an intelligence office where
they deal in help and puts in a blank askin for a job as servant girl
Twas a swell place where bigbugs done their tradin and there she
runs into Cousin Harriet who was a chronic customer always out of
servants owin to the complications of Archibald and nerves And
Harriet hires her because she was pretty and would work for a shavin
moren nothin and carts her right off to Connecticut And when
Margaret sets out to write for her trunk and to tell where she is she
finds shes lost the cousins address and cant remember whether its
Umptyeighth Street or Tin Can Avenue

And oh says she what SHALL I do The mistress is that hard to
please and the child is that wicked till I want to die And I have no
money and no friends O Mike Mike she says If you only knew youd
come to me For its a good heart he has although the five thousand
dollars carried away his head says she

I dont believe I ever wanted to make a fellers acquaintance more than
I done that OShaughnessy mans The mean blackguard to leave his girl
that way And twas easy to see what shed been through with Cousin
Harriet and that brat We tried to comfort her all we could promised to
have a hunt through Long Island and the directory and to help get her
another place when she got back from the South and so on But twas
kind of unsatisfactory Twas her Mike she wanted

I told the Father about it at the church up there she says and he
wrote but the letters was lost I guess And I thought if I might see
a priest here in New York he might help me But the mistress is to go at
noon tomorrer and Ill have no time What SHALL I do says she and
commenced to cry again

Then I had an idea Priest says I Theres a fine big church with
a cross on the ridgepole of it not five minutes walk from this house
I see it as we was comin up Why dont you run down there this minute
I says

No she didnt want to leave Archibald Suppose he should wake up

All right says I Then Ill go myself And Ill fetch a priest up
here if I have to tote him on my back like the feller does the codfish
in the advertisin picture

I didnt have to tote him He lived in a mighty fine house hitched
onto the church and there was half a dozen assistant parsons to help
him do his preachin But he was big and fat and grayhaired and as
jolly and as kindhearted a feller as youd want to meet He said hed
come right along and he done it

Phinney opened the door for us Whats the row says I lookin at
his face

Row he snorts theres row enough for six That daexcuse me
misterthat cussed Archibald has woke up

He had there want no doubt about it And he was raisin hob too
The candy mixed up with the dinner had put his works in line with his
disposition and he was poundin and yellin upstairs enough to wake the
dead Margaret leaned over the balusters

Is it the Father she says Oh dear whatll I do

Send some of the other servants to the boy says the priest and
come down yourself

Simeon lookin kind of foolish explained what had become of the other
servants Father McGraththat was his namelaughed and shook all over

Very well says he Then bring the young man down Perhaps hell be
quiet here

So pretty soon down come Margaret with Archibald full of the Old
Scratch as usual dressed up gay in a kind of red blanket nighty with
a rope around the middle of it The young one spotted Simeon and set up
a whoop

Oh theres the funny whiskers he sings out

Good evenin my son says the priest

Whos the fat man remarks Archibald sociable I never saw such a
red fat man What makes him so red and fat

These questions didnt make Father McGrath any paler He laughed of
course but not as if twas the funniest thing he ever heard

So you think Im fat do you my boy says he

Yes I do says Archibald Fat and red and funny Most as funny as
the whisker man I never saw such funnylookin people

He commenced to point and holler and laugh Poor Margaret was so
shocked and mortified she didnt know what to do

Stop your noise sonny says I This gentleman wants to talk to your
nurse

The answer I got was some unexpected

What makes your feet so big says Archie pointin at my Sunday
boots Why do you wear shoes like that Cant you help it Youre
funny too arent you Youre funnier than the rest of em

We all went into the library then and Father McGrath tried to ask
Margaret some questions Id told him the heft of the yarn on the way
from the church and he was interested But the questionin was mighty
unsatisfyin Archibald was the whole team and the rest of us was
yeller dogs under the wagon

Cant you keep that child quiet asks the priest at last losin his
temper and speakin pretty sharp

O Archie dear DO be a nice boy begs Margaret for the eight
hundredth time

Why dont you punish him as he deserves

Father dear I cant The mistress says hes so sensitive that he has
to have his own way Id lose my place if I laid a hand on him

Come on into the parlor and see the pictures Archie says I

I wont says Archibald Im goin to stay here and see the fat man
make faces

You see says Sim apologizin we cant touch him cause we
promised his ma not to interfere And my right hands got cramps in the
palm of it this minute he adds glarin at the young one

Father McGrath stood up and reached for his hat Margaret began to cry
Archibald dear whooped and kicked the furniture And just then the
frontdoor bell rang

For a minute I thought twas Cousin Harriet and the Holdens come back
but then I knew it was hours too early for that Margaret was too much
upset to be fit for company so I answered the bell myself And who in
the world should be standin on the steps but that big Dempsey man the
boss of the Golconda House where me and Simeon had been stayin the
feller wed spoke to that very mornin

Good evenin sor says he in a voice as deep as a well Im glad
to find you to home sor Theres a telegram come for you at my place
he says and as your friend lift the address when he come for the
baggage this afternoon I brought it along to yez I was comin this
way so twas no trouble

Thats real kind of you I says Step inside a minute wont you

So in he comes and stands holdin his shiny beaver in his hand while
I tore open the telegram envelope Twas a message from a feller I knew
with the Clyde Line of steamboats He had found out somehow that we
was in New York and the telegram was an order for us to come and make
him a visit

I hope its not bad news sor says the big chap

No no says I Not a bit of it Mr Dempsey Come on in and have a
cigar wont you

Thank you sor says he Im glad its not the bad news Sure I ax
you and your friends pardon for bein so short to yez this mornin but
Im in that throuble lately that me timper is all but gone

That so says I Troubles thick in this world aint it Me and Mr
Phinney got a case of trouble on our hands now Mr Dempsey and

Excuse me sor he says My names not Dempsey I suppose you seen
the sign with me partners name on it I only bought into the business
a while ago and the new signs not ready yit Me name is OShaughnessy
sor

What says I And then WHAT

OShaughnessy Michael OShaughnessy I

Hold on I sung out For the land sakes hold on WHATS your name

He bristled up like a cat

Michael OShaughnessy he roars like the bull of Bashan Dyez
find any fault with it Twas me fathers before meMichael Patrick
OShaughnessy of County Sligo Ill have yez knowWHATS THAT

Twas a scream from the librry Next thing I knew Margaret the nurse
girl was standin in the hall white as a Sunday shirt and swingin
back and forth like a wildcarrot stalk in a gale

Mike says she kind of low and faint Mary be good to us MIKE

And the big chap dropped his tall hat on the floor and turned as white
as she was

MAGGIE he hollers And then they closed in on one another

Sim and the priest and Archie had followed the girl into the hall Me
and Phinney was too flabbergasted to do anything but big Father McGrath
was cool as an ice box When Archibald like the little imp he was sets
up a whoop and dives for them two the priest grabs him by the rope of
the blanket nighty and swings him into the librry and shuts the door
on him

And now says he takin Sim and me by the arms and leadin us to the
parlor well just step in here and wait a bit

We waited maybe ten minutes Archibald dear shut up in the librry
was howlin blue murder but nobody paid any attention to him Then
there was a knock on the door between us and the hall and Father
McGrath opened it There they was the two of emMike and
Maggielookin red and foolishbut happy dont talk

You see sor says the OShaughnessy man to me twas the
fivethousanddollar prize that done it Id been workin at me trade
sorlarnin to tind bar it wasand Id just got a new job where the
pay was pretty good and Id sint over for Maggie and was plannin for
the little flat we was to have and the like of that when I drew that
prize And the joy of it was like handin me a jolt on the jaw It put
me out for two weeks sor and when I come to I was in Baltimore where
Id gone to collect the money and two thousand of the five was gone
and I knew me job in New York was gone and I was that shamed and sick
it took me three days more to make up me mind to come to me Cousin
Tims where I knew Maggied be waitin for me And when I did come back
she was gone too

And then says Father McGrath sharp I suppose you went on another
spree and spent the rest of the money

I did not soraxin your pardon for contradictin your riverence
I signed the pledge and Ill keep it with Maggie to help me I put
me three thousand into a partnership with me friend Dempsey who was
runnin the Golconda Housetis over on the East Side with a fine bar
tradeand Im doin well barrin that Ive been crazy for this poor
girl and advertisin and

And look at the clothes of him sings out Margaret reverentlike
And is that YOUR tall hat Mike To think of you with a tall hat Sure
its a proud girl I am this day Saints forgive me Ive forgot Archie

And afore we could stop her shed run into the hall and unfastened
the librry door It took her some time to smooth down the young ones
sensitive feelins and while she was gone me and Simeon told the
OShaughnessy man a little of what his girl had had to put up with along
of Cousin Harriet and Archibald He was mad

Is that the little blackguard he asks pointin to Archibald who
had arrived by now

Thats the one says I

Archibald looked up at him and grinned sassy as ever

Father McGrath asks OShaughnessy determined like can you marry
us this night

I can says the Father

And will yez

I will with pleasure

Maggie says Mike get your hat and jacket on and come with the
Father and me this minute These gintlemen here will explain to your
lady when she comes back But YOULL come back no more Well send for
your trunk tomorrer

Even then the girl hesitated Shed been so used to bein a slave that
I suppose she couldnt realize she was free at last

But Mike dear she says Ioh your lovely hat Put it down
Archie darlin Put it down

Archibald had been doin a little cruisin on his own hook and hed
dug up Mikes shiny beaver where it had been dropped in the hall Now he
was dancin round with it bangin it on the top as if it was a drum

Put it down PLEASE pleads Margaret Twas plain that that plug was
a crown of glory to her

Drop it you little thafe yells OShaughnessy makin a dive for the
boy

I wont screams Archibald and starts to run He tripped over the
corner of a mat and fell flat The plug hat was underneath him and it
fell flat too

Oh oh oh wails Margaret wringin her hands Your beautiful hat
Mike

Mikes face was like a sunset

Your reverence says he tell me this dont the wife promise to
obey in the marriage service

She does says Father McGrath

Dye hear that you thats to be Margaret OShaughnessy You do Well
then as your husband thats to be in tin minutes I order you to give
that small divil whats comin to him Dye hear me Will yez obey me
or will yez not

She didnt know what to do You could see she wanted toher fingers
was itchin to do it butAnd then Archie held up the ruins of the hat
and commenced to laugh

That settled it Next minute he was across her knee and gettin what
hed been sufferin for ever sence he was born and gettin all the back
numbers along with it too

And in the midst of the performance Sim Phinney leans over to me with
the most heavenly resigned expression on his face and says he

It aint OUR fault Hiram We promised not to interfere

What did Sam Holden and his wife say when they got home asked Captain
Sol when the triumphant whoops over Archibalds righteous chastisement
had subsided

We didnt give him much of a chance to say anything I laid for him in
the hall when he arrived and told him that Phinney had got a telegram
and must leave immediate He wanted to know why and a whole lot more
but I told him wed write it Neither Sim nor me cared to face Cousin
Harriet after her darlin son had spun his yarn Ha ha Id like to
have seen her facefrom a safe distance

Captain Bailey Stitt cleared his throat Referrin to them
automobiles he said I

Say Sol interrupted Wingate did I ever tell you of Capn Jonadabs
and my gettin took up by the police when WE was in New York

No replied the astounded depot master Took up by the POLICE

Umhm Surprises you dont it Well that whole trip was a surprise
to me

When Laban Thorp set out to thrash his son and the boy licked him
instead they found the old man settin in the barnyard holdin on to
his nose and grinnin for pure joy

Hurt says he Why some But think of it Only think of it I
didnt believe Bill had it in him

Well thats the way I felt when Capn Jonadab sprung the New York plan
on to me I was pretty nigh as much surprised as Labe The idea of a man
with a chronic case of lockjaw of the pocketbook same as Jonadab had
worried along under ever sence I knew him suddenly breakin loose with
a notion to go to New York on a pleasure cruise Twas too many for me
I set and looked at him

Oh I mean it Barzilla he says I aint been to New York sence I
was mate on the Emma Snow and that was way back in the eighties That
is to stop I aint That time we went through on the way to Peter Ts
weddin dont count cause we only went in the front door and out the
back like Squealer Wixon went through high school Lets you and me go
and stay two or three days and have a real high old time says he

I fetched a long breath Jonadab I says dont scare a feller this
way Ive got a weak heart If youre goin to start in and be divilish
in your old age why do it kind of gradual Lets go over to the
billiard room and have a bottle of sassparilla and a fivecent cigar
just to break the ice

But that only made him mad

You talk like a fish he says I mean it Why cant we go Its
September the Old Home House is shut up for the season you and mes
done wellfurs profits are concernedand we ought to have a change
anyway Weve got to stay here in Orham all winter

Have you figgered out how much its goin to cost I asked him

Yes he had It wont be so awful expensive he says Ive got some
stock in the railroad and thatll give me a pass furs Fall River And
we can take a lunch to eat on the boat And a staterooms a dollar
thats fifty cents apiece And my daughters goin to Denboro on a
visit next week so Id have to pay board if I stayed to home Come on
Barzilla dont be so tight with your money

So I said Id go though I didnt have any pass nor no daughter to
feed me free gratis for nothin when I got back And when we started
on the followin Monday nothin would do but we must be at the depot
at two oclock sos not to miss the train which left at quarter past
three

I didnt sleep much that night on the boat For one thing our
stateroom was a nice lively one alongside of the paddle box and just
under the fog whistle and for another the supper that Jonadab had
brought bein mainly doughnuts and cheese want the best cargo to
take to bed with you But it didnt make much diffrence cause we
turned out at four sos to see the scenery and git our moneys worth
What was left of the doughnuts and cheese we had for breakfast

We made the dock on time and the next thing was to pick out a hotel
I was for cruisin along some of the main streets until we hove in sight
of a place that looked sociable and not too expensive But no Jonadab
had it all settled for me We was goin to the Wayfarers Inn a
boardin house where hed put up once when he was mate of the Emma Snow
He said twas a fine place and you could git as good ham and eggs there
as a bodyd want to eat

So we set sail for the Wayfarers and of all the times gittin to a
placedont talk We asked no less than nine policemen and one hundred
and two other folks and it cost us thirty cents in car fares which
pretty nigh broke Jonadabs heart However we found it finally way
off amongst a nest of brick houses and peddler carts and children and
it want the Wayfarers Inn no more but was down in the shippin
list as the Golconda House Jonadab said the neighborhood had changed
some sence he was there but he guessed wed better chance it cause
the board was cheap

We had a ninebyten room up aloft somewheres and there we set down on
the edge of the bed and a chair to take account of stock as you might
say

Now I tell you Jonadab says I we dont want to waste no time
and weve got the day afore us What do you say if we cruise along
the water front for a spell Theres haf a dozen Orham folks aboard
diffrent steamers that hail from this port and twouldnt be no moren
neighborly to call on em Theres Silas Bakers boy Asahes with the
Savannah Line and hed be mighty glad to see us And theres

But Jonadab held up his hand Hed been mysterious as a bakers mince
pie ever sence we started hintin at somethin hed got to do when wed
got to New York And now he out with it

Barzilla he says I aint sayin but what Id like to go to the
wharves with you first rate And we will go too But afore we do
anything else Ive got an errand that must be attended to Twas give
to me by a dyin man he says and I promised him Id do it So that
comes first of all

He got his wallet out of his inside vest pocket where it had been
pinned in tight to keep it safe from robbers unwound a foot or so of
leather strap and dug up a yeller piece of paper that looked old enough
to be Methusalems will pretty nigh

Do you remember Patrick Kelly in Orham he asks

Who says I Pat Kelly the Irishman that lived in the little old
shack back of your barn Course I do But hes been dead for I dont
know how long

I know he has Do you remember his boy Jim that run away from home

Lets see I says Seems to me I do Freckled redheaded rooster
want he And of all the imps of darkness that ever

Sshsh he interrupted solemn Dont say that now Barzilla Sounds
kind of irreverent Well me and old Pat was pretty friendly in a way
though he did owe me rent When he was sick with the pleurisy he sends
for me and he says Capn Wixon says he youre pretty close with
the money he sayshe was kind of out of his head at the time and
liable to say foolish thingsyoure pretty close he says but
youre a man of your word My boy Jimmie that run away was the apple
of my eye

Thats what he said about his girl Maggie that was took up for
stealin Mrs Elkanah Higginss spoons I says He had a healthy crop
of apples in HIS orchard

Sshh DONT talk so I feel as if the old mans spirit was with
us this minute Hes the apple of my eye he says and he run away
after me latherin the life out of him with a wagon spoke Twas all
for his good but he didnt understand bein but a child And now Ive
heard he says that hes workin at 116 East Blank Street in the city
of New York Capn Wixon youre a man of money and a travelin man he
says I was fishin in them days When you go to New York he says
I want you to promise me to go to the address on this paper and hunt
up Jimmie Tell him I forgive him for lickin him he says and die
happy Will you promise me that Capn on your word as a gentleman
And I promised him And he died in less than ten months afterwards poor
thing

But that was sixteeneighteennineteen years ago says I And the
boy run away three years afore that Youve been to New York in the past
nineteen years once anyhow

I know it But I forgot Im ashamed of it but I forgot And when
I was goin through the things up attic at my daughters last Friday
seein what I could find for the rummage sale at the church I come
across my old writin desk and in it was this very piece of paper with
the address on it just as I wrote it down And me startin for New York
in three days Barzilla I swan to man I believe something SENT me to
that attic

I knew what sent him there and so did the church folks judgin by
their remarks when the contribution came in But I was too much set back
by the whole crazy business to say anything about that

Look here Jonadab Wixon I sings out do you mean to tell me that
weve got to put in the whole forenoon ransackin New York to find a boy
that run off twentytwo years ago

It wont take the forenoon he says Ive got the number aint I

Yes youve got the number where he WAS If you want to know where I
think hes likely to be now Id try the jail

But he said I was unfeelin and disobligin and lots more so to cut
the argument short I agreed to go And off we put to hunt up 116
East Blank Street And when we located it after a good hour of askin
questions and payin car fares and wearin out shoe leather twas a
Chinese laundry

Well I says sarcastic here we be Which one of the heathen do you
think is Jimmie If he had an inch or so more of upper lip Id gamble
on that critter with the pink nighty and the baskets on his feet He has
a kind of familiar chickenstealin look in his eye Oh come down on
the wharves Jonadab and be sensible

Would you believe it he want satisfied We must go into the wash
shop and ask the Chinamen if they knew Jimmie Kelly So we went in and
the powwow begun

Twas a mighty unsatisfyin interview Jonadabs idea of talkin to
furriners is to yell at em as if they was stone deef If they dont
understand what you say yell louder So between his yells and the
heathens jabber and grunts the hullabaloo was worse than a cat in a hen
yard Folks begun to stop outside the door and listen and grin

What did he say asks the Capn turnin to me

I dont know says I but I callate hes gettin ready to send
a note up to the crazy asylum Come on out of here afore I go loony
myself

So he done it finally cross as all get out and swearin that all
Chinese was no good and oughtnt to be allowed in this country But he
wouldnt give up not yet He must scare up some of the neighbors and
ask them The fifth man that we asked was an old chap who remembered
that there used to be a liquor saloon once where the laundry was now
But he didnt know who run it or what had become of him

Never mind I says Youre as warm as youre likely to be this trip
A rum shop is just about the place Id expect that Kelly boy WOULD be
in And if hes like the rest of his relations on his dads side he
drank himself to death years ago NOW will you head for the Savannah
Line

Not much he wouldnt He had another notion Wed look in the
directory That seemed to have a glimmer of sense somewheres in its
neighborhood so we found an apothecary store and the clerk handed us
out a book once again as big as a church Bible

Kelly says Jonadab Yes here tis Now James Kelly Land of
Love Barzilla look here

I looked and there want no less than a dozen pages of James Kellys
beginning with fifty James As and endin with four James Zs The Y
in New York ought to be a C judgin by that directory

Godfrey mighty I says This aint no forenoons job Jonadab If
youre goin through that list youll have to spend the rest of your
life here Only unless you want to be lonesome youll have to change
your name to Kelly

If Id only got his middle letter says he mournful twould have
been easier He had four middle names if I remember rightthe old man
was great on namesand twas too much trouble to write em all down
Well Ive done my duty anyhow Well go and call on Ase Baker

But twas after eleven oclock then and the doughnuts and cheese I
had for breakfast was beginnin to feel as if they wanted company So we
decided to go back to the Golconda and have some dinner first

We had ham and eggs for dinner some that was left over from the last
time Jonadab stopped there I callate Lucky there was hot bread and
coffee on the bill or wed never got a square meal Then we went up to
our room and the Capn laid down on the bed He was beat out he said
and wanted to rest up a spell afore haulin anchor for another cruise




CHAPTER XII

A VISION SENT


Wheres the arrestin come in demanded Stitt

Comes quick now Bailey Plenty quick enough for me and Jonadab I tell
you that After we got to our room the Capn went to sleep pretty soon
and I set in the one chair readin the newspaper and wishin I hadnt
ate so many of the warm bricks that the Golconda folks hoped was
biscuit They made me feel like a schooner goin home in ballast I
guess I was drowsin off myself but there comes a most unearthly yell
from the bed and I jumped haf out of the chair There was Jonadab
settin up and lookin wild

What in the world says I

Oh Ugh My soul says he

Your soul hey says I Is that all I thought mebbe youd lost a
quarter

Barzilla he says comin to and starin at me solemn Barzilla
Ive had a dreama wonderful dream

Well I says I aint surprised A feller that histed in as much
fried dough as you did ought to expect

But I tell you twas a WONDERFUL dream he says I dreamed I was on
Blank Street where we was this mornin and Patrick Kelly comes to me
and pints his finger right in my face I see him as plain as I see
you now And he says to mehe said it over and over two or three
timesSeventeen says he Seventeen Now what do you think of that

Humph I says I aint surprised I think twas just seventeen
of them biscuits that you got away with Wonder to me you didnt see
somebody worsen old Pat

But he was past jokin You never see a man so shook up by the
nightmare as he was by that one He kept goin over it and tellin how
natural old Kelly looked and how many times he said Seventeen to him

Now what did he mean by it he says Dont tell me that was a common
dream cause twant No sir twas a vision sent to me and I know
it But what did he mean

I think he meant you was seventeen kinds of an idiot I snorts
disgusted Get up off that bed and stop wavin your arms will you
He didnt mean for you to turn yourself into a windmill thats sartin
sure

Then he hits his knee a slap that sounds like a window blind blowin
to Ive got it he sings out He meant for me to go to number
seventeen on that street Thats what he meant

I laughed and made fun of him but I might as well have saved my
breath He was sure Pat Kellys ghost had come hikin back from the
hereafter to tell him to go to 17 Blank Street and find his boy Else
why was he ON Blank Street he says You tell me that

I couldnt tell him Its enough for me to figger out what makes live
folks act the way they do let alone dead ones And Capn Jonadab was a
Spiritulist on his mothers side It ended by my agreein to give the
Jimmie chase one more try

But its got to be the last I says When you get to number
seventeen dont you say you think the old man meant to say seventy and
stuttered

Number 17 Blank Street was a little combination fruit and paper store
run by an Eyetalian with curly hair and the complexion of a molasses
cooky His talk sounded as if it had been run through a meat chopper
All he could say was Nica grape gentamen Ony fifteen cent a pound
Nica grape Nica apple Nica pear Nica ploom

Kelly says Jonadab hollerin as usual Kelly dye understand
KELKel LYly Kelly YOU know KELLY We want to find him

And just then up steps a feller about six feet high and three foot
through He was dressed in checkerboard clothes some gone to seed and
you could hardly see the blue tie he had on for the glass dimond in
it Oh he was a little wilted nowfor the lack of water I judgebut
twas plain that hed been a sunflower in his time Hed just come out
of a liquor store next door to the fruit shop and was wipin his mouth
with the back of his hand

Whats this I hear says he fetchin Jonadab a welt on the back like
a mast goin by the board Is it me friend Kelly youre lookin for

I was just goin to tell him no not likin his looks but Jonadab cut
in ahead of me out of breath from the earthquake the feller had landed
him but excited as could be

Yes yes says he Its Mr Kelly we want Do you know him

Do I know him Why me bucko tis me old college chum he is Come on
with me and well give him the glad hand

He grabs Jonadab by the arm and starts along the sidewalk steerin a
tolerble crooked course but gainin steady by jerks

I was on me way to Kellys place now says he And here it is Sure
didnt I bate the bookies blind on Rosebud but yesterdayor was it the
day before I dont know but come on me lads and well do him again

He turned in at a little narrer entrylike and went stumblin up a
flight of dirty stairs I caught hold of Jonadabs coat tails and pulled
him back

Where you goin you crazy loon I whispered Cant you see hes
three sheets in the wind And you havent told him what Kelly you want
nor nothin

But I might as well have hollered at a stone wall I dont care if
hes as fur gone in liquor as Belshazzers goat sputters the Capn
all worked up Hes takin us to a Kelly aint he And is it likely
thered be another one within three doors of the number I dreamed
about Didnt I tell you that dream was a vision sent Dont lay to NOW
Barzilla for the land sakes Its Providence aworkin

Cording to my notion the sunflower looked more like an agent from
tother end of the line than one from Providence but just then he
commenced to yell for us and upstairs we went Jonadab first

Whisht says the checkerboard holdin on to Jonadabs collar and
swingin back and forth Before we proceed to blow in on me friend
Kelly let us come to an understandin concernin and touchin
onandandI dont know But bys says he solemn and confidential
are you on the square Are yez dead game sports hey

Yes yes says Jonadab Course we be Mr Kelly and us are old
friends Weve come I dont know how fur on purpose to see him Now
wheres

Say no more hollers the feller Say no more Come on with yez And
he marches down the dark hall to a door with a To let sign on it and
fetches it a bang with his fist It opens a little ways and a face shows
in the crack

Hello Frank hails the sunflower cheerful Will you take that ugly
mug of yours out of the gate and lave me friends in

Whats the matter wid you Mike asks the chap at the door Yer
cant bring them two yaps in here and you know it Gwan out of this

He tried to shut the door but the checkerboard had his foot between it
and the jamb You might as well have tried to shove in the broadside of
an ocean liner as to push against that foot

These gents are friends of mine says he Frank Ill do yez the
honor of an introduction to Ginral Grant and Danl OConnell Open that
door and compose your face before Im obliged to break both of em

But I tell you Mike I cant says the door man lookin scared
The boss is out and you know

WILL you open that door roars the big chap And with that he hove
his shoulder against the panels and jammed the door open by main force
all but flattenin the other feller behind it Walk in Ginral he
says to Jonadab and in we went me wonderin what was comin next and
not darin to guess

There was a kind of partitioned off hallway inside with another door
in the partition We opened that and there was a goodsized room
filled with men smokin and standin around A high board fence was
acrost one end of the room and from behind it comes a jinglin of
telephone bells and the sounds of talk The floor was covered with
torn papers the window blinds was shut the gas was burnin blue and
between it and the smoke the smells was as various as them in a fish
glue factory On the fence was a couple of blackboards with Belmont
and Brighton and suchlike names in chalk wrote on em and
beneath that a whole mess in writin and figures like Red Tail
4Wt108Jock Smith51 Sourcrout 5Wt99Jock Jones205
and similar rubbish And the ganga mighty mixed lotwas scribblin
in little books and watchin each other as if they was afraid of havin
their pockets picked though to look at em youd have guessed the
biggest part had nothin in their pockets but holes

The sixfoot checkerboardwho it turned out answered to the hail of
Mikeseemed to be right at home with the gang He called most of em
by their first names and went sasshayin around weltin em on the back
and tellin em how hed put crimps in the bookies rolls tother day
and a lot more stuff that they seemed to understand but was hog Greek
to me and Jonadab Hed forgot us altogether which was a mercy the way I
looked at it and I steered the Capn over into a corner and we come to
anchor on a couple of rickety chairs

Whatwhywhat kind of a place IS this Barzilla whispers Jonadab
scared

Shhh says I Land knows Just set quiet and hang on to your
watch

Butbut I want to find Kelly says he

Id give somethin to find a back door says I Aint this a
collection of dock rats though If this is a part of your dream
Jonadab I wish youd turn over and wake up Oh land heres one
murderer headin this way Keep your change in your fist and keep the
fist shut

A moren average rusty peep with a rubber collar on and no necktie
comes slinkin over to us He had a smile like a crack in a plate

Say gents he says have you made your bets yet Ive got a dead
straight line on the handicap says he and Ill put you next for a
one spot Its a sure ting at fifteen to three What do you say

I didnt say nuthin but that fool dream was rattlin round in
Jonadabs skull like a bean in a blowgun and he sees a chance for a
shot

See here mister he says Can you tell me where to locate Mr
Kelly

WhoPete says the feller Oh he aint in just now But about that
handicap I like the looks of youse and Ill let youse in for a dollar
Or seein its you well say a half Only fifty cents I wouldnt do
better for my own old man he says

While the Capn was tryin to unravel one end of this gibberish I spoke
up prompt

Say says I tell me this will you Is the Kelly who owns
thisthis palace named JimmieJames I mean

Naw says he Sure he aint Its Pete Kelly of courseSilver
Pete But what are you givin us Are you bettin on the race or aint
you

Well Jonadab understood that He bristled up like a brindled cat
If theres any one thing the Capn is down on its gamblin and
suchalways exceptin when he knows hes won already Youve seen that
kind maybe

Young feller he says perkish I want you to know that me and my
friend aint the bettin kind What sort of a hole IS this anyway

The rubber collared critter backed off lookin worried He goes acrost
the room and I see him talkin to two or three other thieves as tough
as himself And they commenced to stare at us and scowl

Come on I whispered to Jonadab Lets get out of this place while
we can There aint no Jimmie Kelly here or if there is you dont want
to find him

He was as willin to make tracks as I was by this time and we headed
for the door in the partition But Rubber Collar and some of the others
got acrost our bows

Cut it out says one of em You cant get away so easy Hi Frank
Frank Who let these turnip pullers in here anyhow Who are they

The chap who was tendin door comes out of his coop Youve got me
he says They come in with Big Mike and he was loaded and scrappy and
jammed em through Said they was pals of his Where is he

There was a hunt for Mike and when they got his bearins there
he was keeled over on a bench breathin like an escape valve And an
admirals salute wouldnt have woke him up The whole crew was round us
by this time some ugly and the rest laffin and carryin on

Its the Barkwurst gang says one

Its old Bark himself says another Look at them lace curtains
And he points to Jonadabs whiskers

This ones Jacobs in disguise sings out somebody else You can tell
him by the Rube getup Haw haw

Soak em Do em up Dont let em out hollers a haf dozen more

Jonadab was game Ill say that for him And I hadnt been second mate
in my time for nothin

Take your hands off me yells the Capn I come in here to find
a man Im lookin for James Kelly it was andYou would would you
Stand by Barzilla

I stood by Rubber Collar got one from me that made him remember home
and mother Ill bet Anyhow my knuckles ached for two days afterwards
And Jonadab was just as busy But I callate wed have been ready for
the oven in another five minutes if the door hadnt bust open with a
bang and a loud dressed chap with the sweat pourin down his face
come tearin in

Beat it fellers he yells The place is goin to be pinched Ive
just had the tip and theyre right on top of me

THEN there was times Everybody was shoutin and swearin and fallin
over each other to get out I was kind of lost in the shuffle and
the next thing I remember for sartin is settin up on Rubber Collars
stomach and lookin foggy at the door where the loud dressed man was
wrestlin with a policeman And there was police at the windows and all
around

Well dont talk I got up resurrects Jonadab from under a heap of
gamblers and furniture and makes for harbor in our old corner The
police was mighty busy especially a fat roundfaced redmustached
man with gold bands on his cap and arms that the rest called Capn
Him and the loud dressed chap whod give the alarm was talkin earnest
close to us

I cant help it Pete says the police capn Twas me or the Vice
Suppression crowd Theyve been on to you for two weeks back I only
just got in ahead of em as it was No youll have to go along with
the rest and take your chances Quiet now everybody or youll get it
harder he roars givin orders like the skipper of a passenger boat
Stand in line and wait your turns for the wagon

Jonadab grabbed me by the wrist He was pale and shakin all over

Oh Lordy says he were took up Will we have to go to jail do
you think

I dont know I says disgusted I presume likely we will Did you
dream anything like this Youd better see if you cant dream yourself
out now Twas rubbin it in but I was mad

Oh oh says he flappin his hands And me a deacon of the church
Will folks know it do you think

Will they know it Sounds as if they knew it already Just listen to
that

The first wagon full of prizes was bein loaded in down at the front
door and the crowd outside was cheerin em Judgin by the whoops and
hurrahs there want no less than a million folks at the show and they
was gettin the wuth of admission

Oh dear groans Jonadab And itll be in the papers and all I
cant stand this

And afore I could stop him hed run over and tackled the head
policeman

MisterMister Capn he says pantin theres been a mistake an
awful mistake

Thats right says the police capn there has Six or eight of you
tin horns got clear But Then he noticed who was speakin to him
and his mouth dropped open like a hatch Well saints above he says
Have the upstate delegates got to buckin the ponies too Why aint
you back home killin pertater bugs You ought to be ashamed

But we want gamblinme and my friend want We was led in here
by mistake We was told that a feller named Kelly lived here and were
huntin for a man of that name Ive got a message to him from his poor
dead father back in Orham We come all the way from Orham Massto
find him and

The police capn turned around then and stared at him hard Humph
says he after a spell Go over there and set down till I want you No
youll go now and well waste no breath on it Go on do you hear

So we went and there we set for haf an hour while the rest of the
gang and the blackboards and the paper slips and the telephones and Big
Mike and his chair was bein carted off to the wagon Once when one of
the constables was beatin acrost to get us the police capn spoke to
him

You can leave these two he says Ill take care of them

So finally when there was nothin left but the four walls and us and
some of the police he takes me and Jonadab by the elbows and heads for
the door

Now says he walk along quiet and peaceable and tell me all about
it Get out of this he shouts to the crowd of small boys and loafers
on the sidewalk or Ill take you too

The outsiders fell astern lookin heartbroke and disappinted that we
want hung on the spot and the fat boss policeman and us two paraded
along slow but grand I felt like the feller that was caught robbin
the poorhouse and I callate Jonadab felt the same only he was so
busy beggin and pleadin and explainin that he couldnt stop to feel
anything

He told it all the whole fool yarn from one end to tother How old
Pat give him the message and how he went to the laundry and about his
ridiculous dream every word And the fat policeman shook all over like
a barrel of cod livers

By and by we got to a corner of a street and hove to I could see
the station house loomin up large ahead Fatty took a card from his
pocketbook wrote on it with a pencil and then hailed a hack one of
them sternfirst kind where the driver sits up aloft way aft He pushed
back the cap with the gilt wreath on it and I could see his red hair
shinin like a sunset

Here says he to the hack driver take thesethis pair of salads
to thewhat dye call itthe Golconda House wherever on top of the
pavement that is And mind you deliver em safe and dont let the truck
horses get a bite at em And at halfpast eight tonight you call for
em and bring em here handin up the card hed written on

Tis the address of my house Im givin he says turnin to
Jonadab Ill be off duty then and well have dinner and talk about old
times To think of you landin in Silver Petes pool room Dear dear
Why Capn Wixon barrin that your whiskers are a bit longer and a
taste grayer Id a known you anywheres Manys the time Ive stole
apples over your back fence Im Jimmie Kelly says he

Well by mighty exclaimed the depot master slapping his knee So HE
was the Kelly man Humph

Funny how it turned out want it said Barzilla Course Capn
Jonadab was perfectly sat on spiritulism and signs and omens and such
after that Hes had his fortune told no lessn eight times sence and
nighs I can find out each time its different The amount of blondes
and brunettes and widows and old maids that hes slated to marry
accordin to them fortune tellers is perfectly scandalous If he lives
up to the prophecies Brigham Young wouldnt be a twospot longside of
him

Its funny about dreams mused Captain Hiram Folks are always
tellin about their comin true but none of mine ever did I used to
dream I was goin to be drowned but I aint been yet

The depot master laughed Well he observed once when I was a
youngster I dreamed two nights runnin that I was bein hung I asked
my Sunday school teacher if he believed dreams come true and he said
yes sometimes Then I told him my dream and he said he believed in
that one I judged that any other finish for me would have surprised
him But somehow or other they havent hung me yet

There was a hired girl over at the Old Home House who was sat on
fortune tellin said Wingate Her name was Effie and

Look here broke in Captain Bailey Stitt righteous indignation in his
tone Ive started no less than nineteen different times to tell you
about how I went sailin in an automobile Now do you want to hear it
or dont you

How you went SAILIN in an auto repeated Barzilla Went ridin you
mean

I mean sailin I went ridin too but

Youll have to excuse me Bailey interrupted Captain Hiram rising
and looking at his watch Ive stayed here a good deal longern I
ought to already I must be gettin on home to see how poor little
Dusenberry my boy is feelin I do hope hes better by now I wish Dr
Parker hadnt gone out of town

The depot master rose also And Ill have to be excused too he
declared Its most time for the up train Goodby Hiram Give my
regards to Sophrony and if theres anything I can do to help in case
your baby should be sick just sing out wont you

But I want to tell about this automobilin scrape protested Captain
Bailey It was one of them things that dont happen every day

So was that fortune business of Effies declared Wingate Honest
the way it worked out was queer enough

But the train whistled just then and the group broke up Captain Sol
went out to the platform where Cornelius Rowe Ed Crocker Beriah
Higgins Obed Gott and other interested citizens had already assembled
Wingate and Stitt followed As for Captain Hiram Baker he hurried home
his conscience reproving him for remaining so long away from his wife
and poor little Hiram Joash more familiarly known as Dusenberry




CHAPTER XIII

DUSENBERRYS BIRTHDAY


Mrs Baker met her husband at the door

How is he was the Captains first question Better hey

No was the nervous answer No I dont think he is His throats
terrible sore and the fevers just as bad

Again Captain Hirams conscience smote him

Dear dear he exclaimed And Ive been loafin around the depot
with Sol Berry and the rest of em instead of stayin home with you
Sophrony I KNEW I was doin wrong but I didnt realize

Course you didnt Hiram Im glad you got a few minutes rest after
bein up with him half the night I do wish the doctor was home though
When will he be back

Not until late tomorrer if then Did you keep on givin the
medicine

Yes but it dont seem to do much good You go and set with him now
Hiram I must be seein about supper

So into the sick room went Captain Hiram to sit beside the crib and
sing Sailor boy sailor boy neath the wild billow as a lugubrious
lullaby

Little Hiram Joash tossed and tumbled He was in a fitful slumber when
Mrs Baker called her husband to supper The meal was anything but
a cheerful one They talked but little Over the home ordinarily so
cheerful had settled a gloom that weighed upon them

My my sighed Captain Hiram how lonesome it seems without him
chatterin and racketin sound Seems darkern usual as if there was a
shadow on the place

Hush Hiram dont talk that way A shadow Oh WHAT made you say that
Sounds like a warnin almost

Warnin

Yes a forewarnin you know The valley of the shadow

HUSH Captain Bakers face paled under its sunburn Dont say such
things Sophrony If that happened the Lord help you and me But it
wontit wont Were nervous thats all Were always so careful of
Dusenberry as if he was made out of thin china that we get fidgety
when theres no need of it We mustnt be foolish

After supper Mrs Baker tiptoed into the bedroom She emerged with a
very white face

Hiram she whispered he acts dreadful queer Come in and see him

The first mate was tossing back and forth in the crib making odd
little choky noises in his swollen throat When his father entered he
opened his eyes stared unmeaningly and said Tand by to det der ship
under way

Good Lord hes out of his head gasped the Captain Sophronia and he
stepped back into the sitting room and looked at each other the same
thought expressed in the face of each Neither spoke for a moment then
Captain Hiram said

Now dont you worry Sophrony The Doctor aint home but Im goin out
toto telegraph him or somethin Keep a stiff upper lip Itll be all
right God couldnt go back on you and me that way He just couldnt
Ill be back in a little while

But oh Hiram if he shouldif he SHOULD be taken away what WOULD we
do

She began to cry Her husband laid a trembling hand on her shoulder

But he wont he declared stoutly I tell you God wouldnt do such a
thing Goodby old lady Ill hurry fast as I can

As he took up his cap and turned to the door he heard the voice of the
weary little first mate chokily calling his crew to quarters All hands
on deck

The telegraph office was in Beriah Higginss store Thither ran the
Captain Pat Sharkey Mr Higginss Irish helper who acted as telegraph
operator during Gertie Higginss absence gave Captain Hiram little
satisfaction

How can I get Dr Parker asked Pat Hes off on a cruise and land
knows where I can reach him tonight Ill do what I can Cap but its
ten chances out of nine against a wire gettin to him

Captain Hiram left the store dodging questioners who were anxious to
know what his trouble might be and dazedly crossed Main Street to the
railway station He thought of asking advice of his friend the depot
master

The evening train from Boston pulled out as he passed through the
waiting room One or two passengers were standing on the platform One
of these was a short squareshouldered man with gray side whiskers and
eyeglasses The initials on his suit case were J S M Boston and
they stood for John Spencer Morgan If the bearer of the suit case had
followed the fashion of the native princes of India and had emblazoned
his titles upon his baggage the commonplace name just quoted might have
been followed by MD LLD at Harvard and Oxford vice president
American Medical Society corresponding secretary Associated Society of
Surgeons lecturer at Harvard Medical College author of Diseases of
the Throat and Lungs etc etc

But Dr Morgan was not given to advertising either his titles or
himself and he was hurrying across the platform to Redny Blounts depot
wagon when Captain Hiram touched him on the arm

Why hello Captain Baker exclaimed the Doctor how do you do

Dr Morgan said the Captain II hope youll excuse my presumin on
you this way but I want to ask a favor of you a great favor I want to
ask if youll come down to the house and see the boy hes on the sick
list

What Dusenberry

Yes sir Hes pretty bad Im fraid and the old ladys considerable
upsot about him If you just come down and kind of take an observation
sos we could sort of get our bearins as you might say twould be a
mighty help to all hands

But wheres your town physician Hasnt he been called

The Captain explained He had inquired and he had telegraphed but
could get no word of Dr Parkers whereabouts

The great Boston specialist listened to Captain Hirams story in an
absentminded way Holidays were few and far between with him and when
he accepted the longstanding invitation of Mr Ogden Williams to run
down for the week end he determined to forget the science of medicine
and all that pertained to it for the four days of his outing But an
exacting patient had detained him long enough to prevent his taking the
train that morning and now on the moment of his belated arrival he
was asked to pay a professional call He liked the Captain who had
taken him out fishing several times on his previous excursions to East
Harniss and he remembered Dusenberry as a happy little sea urchin but
he simply couldnt interrupt his pleasure trip to visit a sick baby
Besides the child was Dr Parkers patient and professional ethics
forbade interference

Captain Hiram he said I am sorry to disappoint you but it will
be impossible for me to do what you ask Mr Williams expected me this
morning and I am late already Dr Parker will no doubt return soon
The baby cannot be dangerously ill or he would not have left him

The Captain slowly turned away

Thank you Doctor he said huskily I knew I hadnt no right to ask

He walked across the platform abstractedly striking his right hand into
his left When he reached the ticket window he put one hand against the
frame as if to steady himself and stood there listlessly

The enterprising Mr Blount had been hanging about the Doctor like a cat
about the cream pitcher now he rushed up grasped the suit case and
officiously led the way toward the depot wagon Dr Morgan followed more
slowly As he passed the Captain he glanced up into the latters face
lighted as it was by the lamp inside the window

The Doctor stopped and looked again Then he took another step forward
hesitated turned on his heel and said

Wait a moment Blount Captain Hiram do you live far from here

The Captain started No sir only a little ways

All right Ill go down and look at this boy of yours Mind you Ill
not take the case simply give my opinion on it thats all Blount
take my grip to Mr Williamss Im going to walk down with the
Captain


Haul on ee bowline ee bowline haul muttered the first mate as they
came into the room The lamp that Sophronia was holding shook and the
Captain hurriedly brushed his eyes with the back of his hand

Dr Morgan started perceptibly as he bent forward to look at the little
fevered face of Dusenberry Graver and graver he became as he felt the
pulse and peered into the swollen throat At length he rose and led the
way back into the sitting room

Captain Baker he said simply I must ask you and your wife to be
brave The child has diphtheria and

Diphthery gasped Sophronia as white as her best tablecloth

Good Lord above cried the Captain

Diphtheria repeated the Doctor and although I dislike extremely to
criticize a member of my own profession I must say that any physician
should have recognized it

Sophronia groaned and covered her face with her apron

Aint thereaint there no chance Doctor gasped the Captain

Certainly theres a chance If I could administer antitoxin by
tomorrow noon the patient might recover What time does the morning
train from Boston arrive here

Hafpast ten or thereabouts

Dr Morgan took his notebook from his pocket and wrote a few lines in
pencil on one of the pages Then he tore out the leaf and handed it to
the Captain

Send that telegram immediately to my assistant in Boston he said
It directs him to send the antitoxin by the early train If nothing
interferes it should be here in time

Captain Hiram took the slip of paper and ran out at the door bareheaded

Dr Morgan stood in the middle of the floor absentmindedly looking at
his watch Sophronia was gazing at him appealingly At length he put his
watch in his pocket and said quietly

Mrs Baker I must ask you to give me a room I will take the case
Then he added mentally And that settles my vacation


Dr Morgans assistant was a young man whom nature had supplied with a
prematurely bald head a flourishing beard and a way of appearing ten
years older than he really was To these gifts priceless to a young
medical man might be added boundless ambition and considerable common
sense

The yellow envelope which contained the few lines meaning life or death
to little Hiram Joash Baker was delivered at Dr Morgans Back Bay
office at ten minutes past ten Dr Paysonthat was the assistants
namewas out but Jackson the colored butler took the telegram
into his employers office laid it on the desk among the papers and
returned to the hall to finish his nap in the armchair When Dr Payson
came in at 1130 the sleepy Jackson forgot to mention the dispatch

The next morning as Jackson was cleaning the professional boots in the
kitchen and chatting with the cook the thought of the yellow envelope
came back to his brain He went up the stairs with such precipitation
that the cook screamed thinking he had a fit

Doctah Doctah he exclaimed opening the door of the assistants
chamber did you git dat telegraft I lef on your desk las night

What telegraph asked the assistant sleepily By way of answer Jackson
hurried out and returned with the yellow envelope The assistant opened
it and read as follows


Send 1500 units Diphtheritic Serum to me by morning train Dont fail
Utmost importance

J S MORGAN


Dr Payson sprang out of bed and running to the table took up the
Railway Guide turned to the pages devoted to the O C and C C
Railroad and ran his finger down the printed tables The morning train
for Cape Cod left at 710 It was 645 at that moment As has been said
the assistant had considerable common sense He proved this by wasting
no time in telling the forgetful Jackson what he thought of him He sent
the latter after a cab and proceeded to dress in doublequick time Ten
minutes later he was on his way to the station with the little wooden
case containing the precious antitoxin wrapped and addressed in his
pocket

It was seven by the Arlington Street Church clock as the cab rattled
down Boylston Street A tangle of a trolley car and a market wagon
delayed it momentarily at Harrison Avenue and Essex Street Dr Payson
leaning out as the carriage swung into Dewey Square saw by the big
clock on the Union Station that it was 713 He had lost the train

Now the assistant had been assistant long enough to know that
excusesin the ordinary sense of the worddid not pass current with
Dr Morgan That gentleman had telegraphed for antitoxin and said it
was important that he should have it therefore antitoxin must be sent
in spite of timetables and forgetful butlers Dr Payson went into the
waiting room and sat down to think After a moments deliberation he
went over to the ticket office and asked

What is the first stop of the Cape Cod express

Brockboro answered the ticket seller

Is the train usually on time

Well I should smile Thats Charlie Millss train and the old man
aint been conductor on this road twentytwo years for nothin

Mills Does he live on Shawmut Avenue

Dunno Billy where does Charlie Mills live

Somewhere at the South End Shawmut Avenue I think

Thank you said the assistant and helping himself to a timetable
he went back rejoicing to his seat in the waiting room He had stumbled
upon an unexpected bit of luck

There might be another story written in connection with this one the
story of a veteran railroad man whose daughter had been very very ill
with a dreaded disease of the lungs and who when other physicians
had given up hope had been brought back to health by a celebrated
specialist of our acquaintance But this story cannot be told just now
suffice it to say that Conductor Charlie Mills had vowed that he would
put his neck beneath the wheels of his own express train if by so doing
he could confer a favor on Dr John Spencer Morgan

The assistant saw by his timetable that the Cape Cod express reached
Brockboro at 805 He went over to the telegraph office and wrote two
telegrams The first read like this


CALVIN S WISE The Peoples Drug Store 28 Broad Street Brockboro
Mass

Send package 1500 units Diphtheritic Serum marked with my name to
station Hand to Conductor Mills Cape Cod express Train will wait
Matter life and death


The second telegram was to Conductor Mills It read


Hold train Brockboro to await arrival C A Wise Great personal favor
Very important


Both of these dispatches were signed with the magic name J S Morgan
MD

Well said the assistant as he rode back to his office I dont know
whether Wise will get the stuff to the train in time or whether Mills
will wait for him but at any rate Ive done my part I hope breakfast
is ready Im hungry

Mr Wise of The Peoples Drug Store had exactly two minutes in which
to cover the threequarters of a mile to the station As a matter of
course he was late Inquiring for Conductor Mills he was met by a
redfaced man in uniform who watch in hand demanded what in the vale
of eternal torment he meant by keeping him waiting eight minutes

Do you realize demanded the redfaced man that Im liable to lose
my job Ill have you to understand that if any other man than Doc
Morgan asked me to hold up the Cape Cod express Id tell him to go
right plumb to

Here Mr Wise interrupted to hand over the package and explain that it
was a matter of life and death Conductor Mills only grunted as he swung
aboard the train

Hump her Jim he said to the engineer shes got to make up those
eight minutes

And Jim did


And so it happened that on the morning of the Fourth of July
Dusenberrys birthday Captain Hiram Baker and his wife sat together in
the sitting room with very happy faces The Captain had in his hands
the truly boat with sails which the little first mate had so ardently
wished for

She was a wonder that boat Red hull real lead on the keel brass
rings on the masts reef points on the main and fore sail jib
flying jib and topsails all complete And on the stern was the name
Dusenberry East Harniss

Captain Hiram set her down in front of him on the floor

Gee he exclaimed wont his eyes stick out when he sees that
rig hey Wisht he would be well enough to see it today same as we
planned

Well Hiram said Sophrony we hadnt ought to complain Wed ought
to be thankful hes goin to get well at all Dr Morgan says thanks to
that blessed toxing stuff hell be up and around in a couple of weeks

Sophrony said her husband well have a special birthday celebration
for him when he gets all well You can bake the frosted cake and well
have some of the other children in I TOLD you God wouldnt be cruel
enough to take him away

And this is how Fate and the medical profession and the O C and C
C Railroad combined to give little Hiram Joash Baker his birthday and
explains why as he strolled down Main Street that afternoon Captain
Hiram was heard to sing heartily

 Haul on the bowline the Phrony is arollin
 Haul on the bowline the bowline HAUL




CHAPTER XIV

EFFIES FATE


Surely but very very slowly the little Berry house moved on its
rollers up the Hill Boulevard Right at its heelsif a house may be
said to have heelscame the pure Colonial under the guidance of the
foreman with progressive methods Groups of idlers male and female
stood about and commented Simeon Phinney smilingly replied to their
questions Captain Sol himself seemed little interested He spent most
of his daylight time at the depot only going to the Higginses house
for his meals At night after the station was closed he sought his own
dwelling climbed over the joist and rollers entered retired to his
room and went to bed

Each day also he grew more taciturn Even with Simeon his particular
friend he talked little

What IS the matter with you Sol asked Mr Phinney Youre as glum
as a tonguetied parrot Aint you satisfied with the way Im doin your
movin The white horse can go back again if you say so

Im satisfied grunted the depot master Let you know when Ive
got any fault to find How soon will you get abreast theabreast the
Seabury lot

Lets see mused the building mover Todays the eighth Well Ill
be there by the eleventh SURE Cant drag it out no longer Sol
even if the other horse is took sick Twont do Williams has been
complainin to the selectmen and theyre beginnin to pester me As for
that Colt and Adams foremanwhew

He whistled His companion smiled grimly

Williams himself drops in to see me occasional he said Tells me
what he thinks of me with all the trimmins added I callate he gets
as good as he sends Im always glad to see him he keeps me cheered up
in his way

Yees I shouldnt wonder Was he in today

He was And somethin has pleased him I guess At any rate he was in
better spirits Asked me if I was goin to move right onto that Main
Street lot soon as my house got there

What did you say

I said I was callatin to Told him I hated to get out of the
highsociety circles Id been livin in lately but that everyone had
their comedowns in this world

Ho ho that was a good one What answer did he make to that

Well he said the high society would miss me Then he finished up
with a piece of advice Berry says he dont move onto that lot TOO
quick I wouldnt if I was you Then he went away chucklin

Chucklin hey What made him so joyful

Dont knowCaptain Sols face clouded once moreand I care less
he added brusquely

Simeon pondered Have you heard from Abner Payne Sol he asked Has
Ab answered that letter you wrote sayin youd swap your lot for the
Main Street one

No he hasnt I wrote him that day I told you to move me

Hum thats kind of funny You dont spose

He stopped noticing the expression on his friends face The depot
master was looking out through the open door of the waiting room On
the opposite side of the road just emerging from Mr Higginss general
store was Olive Edwards the widow whose home was to be pulled down
as soon as the Colonial reached its destination She came out of
the store and started up Main Street Suddenly and as if obeying an
involuntary impulse she turned her head Her eyes met those of Captain
Sol Berry the depot master For a brief instant their glance met then
Mrs Edwards hurried on

Sim Phinney sighed pityingly Looks kind of tired and worried dont
she he ventured His friend did not speak

I say repeated Phinney that Olive looks sort of worn out and

Has she heard from the Omaha cousin yet interrupted the depot master

No Mr Hilton says not Sol what DO you spose

But Captain Sol had risen and gone into the ticket office The door
closed behind him Mr Phinney shook his head and walked out of the
building On his way back to the scene of the house moving he shook his
head several times

On the afternoon of the ninth Captain Bailey Stitt and his friend
Wingate came to say goodby Stitt was going back to Orham on the up
train due at 330 Barzilla would return to Wellmouth and the Old Home
House on the evening the down train

Hey Sol shouted Wingate as they entered the waiting room Sol
where be you

The depot master came out of the ticket office Hello boys he said
shortly

Hello Sol hailed Stitt Barzilla and me have come to shed the
farewell tear As hirelins of soulless corporations meanin the Old
Home House at Wellmouth and the Ocean House at Orham weve engaged all
the shellfish alongshore and are goin to clear out

Yes chimed in his fellow hireling and we thought the pleasantest
place to put in our few remainin hoursas the papers say when a
fellers goin to be hungwas with you

I thought so said Captain Bailey with a wink Weve been havin
more or less of an argument Sol Remember how Barzilla made fun of
Jonadab Wixon for believin in dreams Yes well that was only make
believe He believes in em himself

I dont either declared Wingate And I never said so What I said
was that sometimes it almost seemed as if there was somethin IN fortune
tellin and such

There is chuckled Bailey with another wink at the depot master
Theres money in itfor the fortune tellers

I saidand I say again protested Barzilla that I knew a case at
our hotel of a servant girl named Effie and she

Oh Heavens to Betsy Here he goes again I steered him in here on
purpose Sol sos hed get off that subject

You never neither You said

The depot master held up his hand Dont both talk at once he
commanded Set down and be peaceful cant you Thats right What
about this Effie Barzilla

Now look here protested Stitt

Shut up Bailey Who was Effie Barzilla

She was third assistant roustabout and table girl at the Old Home
House said Wingate triumphantly Got another cigar Sol Thanks Yes
this Effie had never worked out afore and she was greenern a mess of
spinach but she was kind of pretty to look at and

Ah ha crowed Captain Bailey here comes the heart confessions Want
to look out for these old bachelors Sol Fire away Barzilla let us
know the worst

I took a fancy to her in a way She got in the habit of tellin me her
troubles and secrets me bein old enough to be her dad

Aw yes this from Stitt the irrepressible Thats an old gag We
know

WILL you shut up demanded Captain Sol Go on Barzilla

Me bein old enough to be her dad with a glare at Captain Bailey
and not bein too proud to talk with hired help I never did have that
hightoned notion Twant so long since I was a fomast hand

So Effie told me a lot about herself Seems shed been over to the
Cattle Show at Ostable one year and she was loaded to the gunwale with
some more or less facts that a fortunetellin specimen by the name of
the Marvelous Oriental Seer had handed her in exchange for a quarter

Yup says she bobbin her head so emphatic that the skyblue ribbon
pennants on her black hair flapped like a loose topsl in a gale of
wind Yup says she I blieve it just as much as I blieve anything
How could I help it when he told me so much that has come true already
He said Id seen trouble and the dear land knows thats so and that I
might see more and I callate thats pretty average likely And he said
I hadnt been brought up in luxury

Which want no exaggeration neither I put in thinkin of the shack
over on the Neck Road where she and her folks used to live

No says she and he told me Id always had longins for better and
higher things and that my intellectuals was above my station Well ever
sence I was knee high to a kitchen chair Id ruther work upstairs than
down and as for intellectuals ma always said I was the smartest
young one shed raised yet So them statements give me considerble
confidence But he give out that I was to make a journey and get money
and when THAT come true I held up both hands and stood ready to swaller
all the rest of it

So it come true did it says I

Umhm says she bouncin her head again Inside of four year I
traveled way over to South Eastboromost twelve mileto my Uncle
Issys funral and there I found that hed left me nine hundred dollars
for my very own And down I flops on the parlor sofy and says I There
dont talk superstition to ME no more A person that can foretell Uncle
Issys givin anybody a cent let alone nine hundred dollars is a good
enough prophet for ME to tie to Now I KNOW that Im going to marry the
darkcomplected man and Ill be ready for him when he comes along
I never spent a quarter no better than when I handed it over to that
Oriental Seer critter at the Cattle Show Thats what I said then and I
blieve it yet Wouldnt you feel the same way

I said sure thing I would Id found out that the best way to keep
Effies talk shop runnin was to agree with her And I liked to hear her
talk

Yup she went on I give right in then Id traveled same as the
fortune teller said and Id got more moneyn I ever expected to see
let alone own And ever sence Ive been sartin as Im alive that the
feller I marry will be of a rank highern mine and dark complected and
goodlookin and distinguished and that hell be name of Butler

Butler says I What will he be named Butler for

Cause the Seer critter said so He said he could see the word Butler
printed out over the top of my head in flamin letters Pa used to say
twas a wonder it never set fire to my crimps but he was only foolin
I know that its all comin out true You aint acquaintanced to any
Butlers are you

No says I I heard Ben Butler make a speech once when he was
govnor but hes dead now There aint no Butlers on the Old Home
shippin lists

Oh I know that she says And everybody round here is homeliern a
moultin pullet There now I didnt mean exactly EVERYbody of course
But you aint dark complected you know nor

No says I nor rank nor distinguished neither Course the handsome
part might fit me but Id have to pass on the rest of the hand Thats
all right Effie my feelins have got fireproofed sence Ive been
in the summer hotel business Now youd better run along and report to
Susannah I hear her whoopin for you and she dont light like a canary
bird on the party shes mad with

She didnt that was a fact Susannah Debs who was housekeeper for us
that year was middlin young and middlin goodlookin and couldnt
forget it Also and likewise she had a suit for damages against the
railroad which she had hopes would fetch her money some day or other
and she couldnt forget that neither She was skipper of all the hired
hands and bein as Effie was prettier than she was never lost a chance
to lay the poor girl out She put the other help up to pokin fun at
Effies green ways and hightoned notions and twas her that started
em callin her Lady Evelyn in the focastleservants quarters I
mean

Im acomin screams Effie startin for the door Susannahs in a
tearin hurry to get through early today she adds to me Shes got
the afternoon off and her beaus comin to take her buggy ridin
Hes from over Harniss way somewheres and they say hes just lovely My
sakes I wisht somebodyd take ME to ride Ah hum callate Ill have to
wait for my Butler man Say Mr Wingate you wont mention my fortune
to a soul will you I never told anybody but you

I promised to keep mum and she cleared out After dinner as I was
smokin along with Capn Jonadab on the side piazza a horse and
buggy drove in at the back gate A young chap with black curly hair was
pilotin the craft He was a stranger to me wore a checkerboard suit
and a bonfire necktie and had his hat twisted over one ear Altogether
he looked some like a sunflower goin to seed

Whos that barbers sign when its to home says I to Jonadab He
snorted contemptuous

That he says Dont you know the cut of that critters jib He
plays pool for the house in Web Saunderss place over to Orham Hes
the housekeepers steady compnysteady by spells if all I hears
true Goodfornothin cub I call him Wisht Id had him aboard a
vessel of mine Id a squared his yards for him Look how he cants his
hat to starboard sos to show them lovelocks Bah

Whats his name I asks

Name Names ButlerSimeon Butler Dont you remember    Hey What
in tunket   

Both of us had jumped as if somebodyd touched off a bombshell under
our main hatches The windows of the dining room was right astern of us
We whirled round and there was Effie Shed been clearin off one of
the tables and there she stood with the smashed pieces of an icecream
platter in front of her the melted cream sloppin over her shoes and
her face lookin like the picture of Lots wife just turnin to salt
Only Effie looked as if she enjoyed the turnin She never spoke nor
moved just stared after that buggy with her black eyes sparklin like
burnt holes in a blanket

I was too astonished to say anything but Jonadab had his eye on that
smashed platter and HE had things to say plenty of em I walked off
and left Effie playin congregation to a sermon on the text Crockery
costs money Youd think that icecream dish was a genuine ugly nicked
antique wuth any city loons ten dollars instead of bein only new
and pretty fiftycent china I felt real sorry for the poor girl

But I neednt have been That evenin I found her on the back steps
all Sunday duds and airs Her hair had a wire friz on it and her dress
had Josephs coat in Scriptur lookin like a mournin rig Shed have
been real handsometo a body that was color blind

My Effie says I you sartin do look fine tonight

Yup she says contented I guess likely I do Hope so cause Im
wearin all Ive got Say Mr Wingate says she excited as a cat in a
fit did you see him

Him says I Whos him

Why HIM The one the Seer said was comin The handsome
darkcomplected feller Im goin to marry The Butler one That was him
in the buggy this afternoon

I looked at her Id forgot all about the fool prophecy

Good land of love I says You dont callate hes comin to marry
YOU do you just cause his names Butler Theres ten thousand Butlers
in the world Besides your particular one was slated to be high ranked
and distinguished and this specimen scrubs up the billiardroom floor
and aint no more distinguished than a poorhouse pig

Aint she sings out Aint distinguished With all them beautiful
curls and rings on his fingers and

Bells on his toes No says I emphatic Anyhow hes signed for
the vyage already Hes Susannah Debss steady and theyre off buggy
ridin together right now And if she catches you makin eyes at her
best fellerWhew

Didnt make no difference He was her Butler sure Twas Fatethats
what twasFate just the same as in storybooks She was sorry for poor
Susannah and she wouldnt do nothin mean nor underhanded but couldnt
I understand that twas all planned out for her by Providence and that
everlastin Seer Just let me watch and see thats all

What can you do with an idiot like that I walked off disgusted and
left her But I callated to watch I judged twould be more fun than
any playactin show ever I took in

And twas in a way Dont ask me how they got acquainted cause I
cant tell you for sartin Nighs I can learn Susannah and Sim had some
sort of lovers row durin their buggy ride and when they got back to
the hotel they was scurcely on speakin terms And Sim who always had a
watch out forard for pretty girls see Effie standin on the servants
porch all togged up regardless and gay as a teastore chromo and
nothin to do but he must be introduced One of the stable hands done
the introducin I blieve and if hed have been hung afterwards
twould have sarved him right

Anyhow inside of a week Butler come round again to take a lady friend
drivin but this time twas Effie not the housekeeper that was
passenger And Susannah glared after em like a cat after a sparrow
and the very next day she was for havin Effie discharged for
incompetentiveness I give Jonadab the tip though so that didnt go
through But I callate there was a parrot and monkey time among the
help from then on

They all sided with Susannah of course She was their boss for one
thing and Lady Evelyns highminded notions want popular for
another But Effie didnt carebless you no She and that Butler sport
was together more and more and the next thing I heard was that they was
engaged I snum if it didnt look as if the Oriental man knew his job
after all

I spoke to the stable hand about it

Look here says I is this business betwixt that pool player and our
Effie serious

He laughed Serious enough I guess he says Theyre goin to
be married pretty soon I hear Its all cordin to the law and the
prophets Aint you heard about the fortune tellin and how twas
foretold shed marry a Butler

Id heard but I didnt spose he had However it seemed that Effie
hadnt been able to keep it to herself no longer Soon as shed hooked
her man shed blabbed the whole thing The fomast hands want talkin
of nothin else so this feller said

Humph says I Is it the prophecy that Butlers bankin on

He laughed again Not so much as on Lady Evelyns nine hundred I
callate says he Sim likes Susannah the best of the two so we all
reckon but she aint rich and Effie is And yet if the Debs woman
should win that lawsuit of hers against the railroad shed have pretty
nigh twice as much Butlers a fool not to wait I think he says

This was of a Monday On Friday evenin Effie comes around to see me I
was alone in the office

Mr Wingate she says Im goin to leave tomorrer night Im goin
to be married on Sunday

Id been expecting it but I couldnt help feelin sorry for her

Dont do nothin rash Effie I told her Are you sure that Butler
critter cares anything about you and not your money

She flared up like a tar barrel The idea she says turnin red I
just come in to give you warnin Goodby

Hold on I sung out to her Effie Ive thought considerble about
you lately Ive been tryin to help you a little on the sly I realized
that twant pleasant for you workin here under Susannah Debs and
Ive been tryin to find a nice place for you I wrote about you to Bob
Van Wedderburn hes the rich banker chap who stopped here one summer
Jonesy we used to call him I know him and his wife fust rate and
hed do most anything as a favor to me I told him what a neat handy
girl you was and he writes that hell give you the job of second girl
at his swell New York house if you want it Now you just hand that Sim
Butler his clearance papers and go work for Bobs wife The wages are
double what you get here and

She didnt wait to hear the rest Just sailed out of the room with her
nose in the air In a minute though back she come and just put her
head in the door

Im much obliged to you Mr Wingate says she I know you mean
well But you aint had your fate foretold sames I have Its all
been arranged for me and I couldnt stop it no moren Jonah could help
swallerin the whale II kind of wish youd be on hand at the back
door on Sunday mornin when Simeon comes to take me away Youyoure
about the only real friend Ive got she says

And off she went for good this time I pitied her in spite of her
bein such a dough head I knew what sort of a husband that poolroom
shark would make However there want nothin to be done And next day
Capn Jonadab was round maddern a licked pup Seems Susannahs lawyer
at Orham had sent for her to come right off and see him Somethin about
the suit it was And she was goin in spite of everything And with
Effies leavin at the same time what was we goin to do over Sunday
and so forth and so on

Well we had to do the best we could thats all But that Saturday
was busy now I tell you Sunday mornin broke fine and clear and after
breakfast was over I remembered Effie and that twas her weddin day
On the back steps I found her dressed in all her grandeur with her
packed trunk ready waitin for the bridegroom

Aint come yet hey Effie says I

No says she smilin and radiant Its a little early for him yet
I guess

I went off to tend to the boarders At half past ten when I made the
back steps again she was still there Tother servants was peekin out
of the kitchen windows grinnin and passin remarks

Hello I calls out Not married yet Whats the matter

Shed stopped smilin but she was as chipper as ever to all
appearances

II guess the horse has gone lame or somethin says she Hell be
here any time now

There was a cackle from the kitchen windows I never said nothin
Shed made her nest now let her roost on it

But at twelve Butler hadnt hove in sight Every hand male and female
on the place that want busy was hangin around the back of the
hotel waitin and watchin and ridiculin and havin a high time Them
that had errands made it a pint to cruise past that way Lots of the
boarders had got wind of the doins and they was there too

Effie was settin on her trunk tryin hard to look brave I went up
and spoke to her

Come my girl says I Dont set here no longer Come into the house
and wait Hadnt you better

No says she loud and defiant like No sir Its all right Hes a
little late thats all What do you spose I care for a lot of jealous
folks like those up there wavin her flipper scornful toward the
kitchen

And then all to once she kind of broke down and says to me with a
pitiful sort of choke in her voice

Oh Mr Wingate I cant stand this Why DONT he come

I tried hard to think of somethin comfortin to say but afore I
could hist a satisfyin word out of my hatches I heard the noise of a
carriage comin Effie heard it too and so did everybody else We all
looked toward the gate Twas Sim Butler sure enough in his buggy and
drivin the same old horse but settin alongside of him on the seat was
Susannah Debs the housekeeper And maybe she didnt look contented with
things in genral

Butler pulled up his horse by the gate Him and Susannah bowed to all
hands Nobody said anything for a minute Then Effie bounced off the
trunk and down them steps

Simmie she sung out breathless like Simeon Butler what does this
mean

The Debs woman straightened up on the seat Thank you marm says
she chilly as the top section of an ice chest Ill request you not to
call my husband by his first name

It was so still you could have heard yourself grow Effie turned white
as a Sunday tablecloth

Yourhusband she gasps Youryour HUSBAND

Yes marm purrs the housekeeper My husband was what I said Mr
Butler and me have just been married

Sorry Effie old girl puts in Butler so sassy Id love to have
preached his funral sermon Too bad but fust loves strongest you
know Susie and me was engaged long afore you come to town

THEN such a hawhaw and whoop bust from the kitchen and focastle as
you never heard For a jiffy poor Effie wilted right down Then she
braced up and her black eyes snapped

I wish you joy of your bargain marm says she to Susannah Youd
ought to be proud of it And as for YOU she says swingin round
toward the rest of the help I

How bout that prophet hollers somebody

Three cheers for the Oriental bellers somebody else

When you marry the right Butler fetch him along and let us see him
whoops another

She faced em all and I gloried in her spunk

When I marry him I WILL come back says she And when I do youll
have to get down on your knees and wait on me Youand youYes and
YOU too

The last two yous was hove at Sim and Susannah Then she turned and
marched into the hotel And the way them hired hands carried on was
somethin scandaloustill I stepped in and took charge of the deck

That very afternoon I put Effie and her trunk aboard the train I
paid her fare to New York and give her directions how to locate the Van
Wedderburns

So long Effie says I to her Its all right Youre enough sight
better off All you want to do now is to work hard and forget all that
fortunetellin foolishness

She whirled on me like a top

Forget it she says I GUESS I shant forget it Its comin true
I tell yousame as all the rest come true You said yourself there was
ten thousand Butlers in the world Some day the right onethe handsome
highranked distinguished onewill come along and Ill get him You
wait and see Mr Wingatejust you wait and see




CHAPTER XV

THE HERO AND THE COWBOY


So that was the end of it hey said Captain Bailey Well its what
you might expect but it want much to be so anxious to tell and as
for PROVIN anything about fortune tellinwhy

It AINT the end shouted the exasperated Barzilla Not nigh the end
Twas the beginnin The housekeeper left us that day of course and
for the rest of that summer the servant question kept me and Jonadab
from thinkin of other things Course the reason for the Butler scamps
sudden switch was plain enough Susannahs lawyer had settled the case
with the railroad and even after his fee was subtracted there was
fifteen hundred left That was enough sight bettern nine hundred so
Sim figgered when he heard of it and he hustled to make up with his old
girl

Fifteen hundred dollars doesnt last long with some folks At the
beginnin of the next spring season both of em was round huntin jobs
Susannah was a fustrate waitress so we hired her for thatno more
housekeeper for hers and served her right As for her husband we took
him on in the stable He wouldnt have been wuth his salt if it hadnt
been for her She said shed keep him movin and she did She nagged and
henpecked him till Id have been sorry if twas anybody else as twas
I got considerble satisfaction out of it

I got one letter from Effie pretty soon after she left sayin she
liked her new job and that the Van Wedderburns liked her And thats all
I did hear though Bob himself wrote me in May sayin him and
Mabel his wife had bought a summer cottage in Wapatomac and me and
Jonadabespecially memust be sure and come to see it and them He
never mentioned his second girl and I almost forgot her myself

But one afternoon in early July a big sixcylinder automobile come
sailin down the road and into the Old Home House yard A shoferI
blieve thats what they call the tribewas at the helm of it and on
the back seat lollin luxurious against the upholstery was a man and
a woman got up regardless in silk dusters and goggles and veils and
prosperity I never expect to see the Prince of Wales and his wife but
I know how theyd lookafter seein them two

Jonadab was at the bottom step to welcome em bowin and scrapin as
if his middle jint had just been iled I want fur astern and every
boarder on deck was all eyes and envy

The shofer opens the door of the after cockpit of the machine and the
man gets out fust treadin gingerly but grand as if he was doin the
ground a condescension by steppin on it Then he turns to the woman and
she slides out her duds rustlin like the wind in a scrub oak The pair
sails up the steps Jonadab and me backin and fillin in front of em
All the help that could get to a window to peek had knocked off work to
do it

Ahem says the man pompous as Julius Caesarhe was big and
straight and fine lookin and had black side whiskers half mast on his
cheeksahem says he I say good people may we have dinner here

Well they tell us time and tide waits for no man but probly that
dont include the nobility Anyhow although twas long past our reglar
dinner time I heard Jonadab tellin em sure and sartin they could If
they wouldnt mind settin on the piazza or in the front parlor for a
spell hed have somethin prepared in a jiffy So up to the piazza they
paraded and come to anchor in a couple of chairs

You can have your automobile put right into the barn I says if you
want to

I dont know as it will be necessary began the big feller but the
woman interrupted him She was starin through her thick veil at the
barn door Sim Butler in his overalls and ragged shirt sleeves was
leanin against that door interested as the rest of us in what was
goin on

I would have it put there I think says the woman lofty and
superior It is rather dusty and I think the wheels ought to be
washed Can that man be trusted to wash em she asks pointin kind of
scornful at Simeon

Yes marm I callate so I says Here Sim I sung out callin
Butler over to the steps Can you wash the dust off them wheels

He said course he could but he didnt act joyful over the job The
woman seemed some doubtful

He looks like a very ignorant common person says she loud and
clear so that everybody includin the ignorant person himself could
hear her However Jamesll superintend James she orders the shofer
you see that it is well done wont you Make him be very careful

James looked Butler over from head to foot Humph he sniffs
contemptuous with a kind of half grin on his face Yes marm Ill
tend to it

So he steered the auto into the barn and Simeon got busy Judgin by
the sharp language that drifted out through the door twas plain that
the shofer was superintendin all right

Jonadab heaves in sight bowin and makes proclamation that dinner
is served The pair riz up majestic and headed for the dinin room The
woman was a little astern of her man and in the hall she turns brisk to
me

Mr Wingate she whispers Mr Wingate

I stared at her Her voice had sounded sort of familiar ever sence I
heard it but the veil kept a body from seein what she looked like

Hey I sings out Have I ever

Sshh she whispers Say Mr Wingate thatthat Susannah thing
is here aint she Have her wait on us will you please

And she swept the veil off her face I choked up and staggered bang
against the wall I swan to man if it want Effie EFFIE in silks and
automobiles and gorgeousness

Afore I could come to myself the two of em marched into that dining
room I heard a grunt and a Land of love from just ahead of me That
was Jonadab And from all around that dinin room come a sort of gasp
and then the sound of whisperin That was the help

They took a table by the window which had been made ready Down they
set like a king and a queen perchin on thrones One of the waiter girls
went over to em

But Id come out of my trance a little mite The situation was miles
ahead of my brain goodness knows but the joke of it all was gettin a
grip on me I remembered what Effie had asked and I spoke up prompt

Susannah says I this is a particular job and were anxious to
please Youd better do the waitin yourself

I wish you could have seen the glare that exhousekeeper give me For
a second I thought wed have open mutiny But her place want any too
sartin and she didnt dare risk it Over she walked to that table and
the fun began

Jonadab had laid himself out to make that meal a success but they ate
it as if twas pretty poor stuff and not by no means what they fed on
every day They found fault with most everything but most especial
with Susannahs waitin My how they did order her arounda mate on a
cattle boat want nothin to it And when twas all over and they got
up to go Effie says sos all hands can hear

The food here is not so bad but the serviceoh horrors However
Albert says she to the sidewhiskered man you had better give the
girl our usual tip She looks as if she needed it poor thing

Then they paraded out of the room and I see Susannah sling the half
dollar the man had left on the table clear to Jericho it seemed like

The auto was waitin by the piazza steps The shofer and Butler was
standin by it And when Sim see Effie with her veil throwed back he
pretty nigh fell under the wheels hed been washin so hard And he
looked as if he wisht theyd run over him

Oh dear sighs Effie lookin scornful at the wheels Not half
clean just as I expected I knew by the looks of thatthat PERSON that
he wouldnt do it well Dont give him much Albert he aint earned
it

They climbed into the cockpit the shofer took the helm and they was
ready to start But I couldnt let em go that way Out I run

Saysay Effie I whispers eager For the goodness sakes whats
all this mean Is that youryour

My husband Yup she whispers back her eyes shinin Didnt I tell
you to look out for my prophecy Aint he handsome and distinguished
just as I said Goodby Mr Wingate maybe Ill see you again some
day

The machinery barked and they got under way I run along for two steps
more

But Effie says I tell meis his name

She didnt answer She was watchin Sim Butler and his wife Sim had
stooped to pick up the quarter the Prince of Wales had hove at him And
that was too much for Susannah who was watchin from the window

Dont you touch that money she screams Dont you lay a finger on
it Aint you got any selfrespect at all you miserble lowlived
and so forth and so on All the way to the front gate I see Effie
leanin out lookin and listenin and smilin

Then the machine buzzed off in a typhoon of dust and I went back to
Jonadab who was a livin catechism of questions which neither one of us
could answer

So THATS the end exclaimed Captain Bailey Well

No it aint the endnot even yet Maybe it ought to be but it aint
Theres a little more of it

A fortnit later I took a couple of days off and went up to Wapatomac
to visit the Van Wedderburns same as Id promised Their cottage was
pretty nigh big enough for a hotel and was so grand that I even if I
did have on my Sunday frills was most ashamed to ring the doorbell

But I did ring it and the feller that opened the door was big and
solemn and fine lookin and had side whiskers Only this time he wore a
tail coat with brass buttons on it

How do you do Mr Wingate says he Step right in sir if you
please Mr and Mrs Van Wedderburn are out in the auto but theyll be
back shortly and very glad to see you sir Im sure Let me take
your grip and hat Step right into the reception room and wait if you
please sir Perhaps he says and there was a twinkle in his port eye
though the rest of his face was sober as the front door of a church
perhaps says he you might wish to speak with my wife a moment Ill
take the liberty of sendin her to you sir

So as I sat on the gunwale of a blue and gold chair tryin to settle
whether I was really crazy or only just dreamin in bounces Effie
rigged up in a servants cap and apron She looked polite and demure
but I could see she was just bubblin with the joy of the whole
busness

Effie says I Effie whatwhat in the world

She giggled Yup she says Im chambermaid here and they treat me
fine Thank you very much for gettin me the situation

Butbut them doins the other day That automobileand them silks
and satinsand

Mr Van Wedderburn lent em to me she said him an his wife And
he lent us the auto and the shofer too I told him about my troubles
at the Old Home House and he thought twould be a great joke for me
to travel back there like a lady Hes awful fond of a jokeMr Van
Wedderburn is

But that man I gasps Your husband Thats what you said he was

Yes says she he is Weve been married most six months now My
prophecys all come true And DIDNT I rub it in on that Susannah Debs
and her scamp of a Sim Ho ho

She clapped her hands and pretty nigh danced a jig she was so tickled

But is he a Butler I asks

Yup she nods with another giggle Hes A butler though his names
Jenkins and a butlers high rankhigher than chambermaid anyhow You
see Mr Wingate she adds twas all my fault When that Oriental
Seer man at the show said I was to marry a butler I forgot to ask him
whether you spelt it with a big B or a little one

The unexpected manner in which Effies pet prophecy had been fulfilled
amused Captain Sol immensely He laughed so heartily that Issy McKay
looked in at the door with an expression of alarm on his face The
depot master had laughed little during the past few days and Issy was
surprised

But Captain Stitt was ready with a denial He claimed that the prophecy
was NOT fulfilled and therefore all fortune telling was fraudulent
Barzilla retorted hotly and the argument began again The two were
shouting at each other Captain Sol stood it for a while and then
commanded silence

Stop your yellin he ordered What ails you fellers Think you can
prove it better by screechin They can hear you half a mile Theres
Cornelius Rowe standin gawpin on the other side of the street this
minute He thinks theres a fire or a riot one or tother Lets change
the subject See here Bailey didnt you start to tell us somethin
last time you was in here about your ridin in an automobile

I started toyes But nobodyd listen I rode in one and I sailed in
one You see

Im goin outdoor declared Barzilla

No youre not Bailey listened to you Now you do as much for him I
heard a little somethin about the affair at the time it happened and
Id like to hear the rest of it How was it Bailey

Captain Stitt knocked the ashes from his pipe

Well he began I didnt know the critter was weak in his top riggin
or I wouldnt have gone with him in the fust place And he want
real loony nuther Twas only when he got aboard thatthat ungodly
kerosenesmellin tootin buzzin Old Harrys gocart of his that the
craziness begun to show Theres so many of them weakminded city folks
from the Ocean House comes perusin round summers nowadays that
I callated he was just an average specimen and never examined him
close

Are all the Ocean House boarders weakminded nowadays asked the depot
master

Mr Wingate answered the question

My land he snapped would they board at the Ocean House if they
WANT weakminded

Captain Bailey did not deign to reply to this jibe He continued calmly

This feller want an Ocean Houser though He was young Stumptons
automobile skippershover or shofer or somethin they called him He
answered to the hail of Billings and his home port was the Stumpton
ranch way out in Montana Hed been here in Orham only a couple of
weeks havin come plumb across the United States to fetch his boss the
new automobile You see twas early October The Stumptons had left
their summer place on the Cliff Road and was on their way South for
the winter Young Stumpton was up to Boston but he was comin back in
a couple of days and then him and the shover was goin automobilin to
Florida To Florida mind you In that thing If it was me Id buy my
ticket to Tophet direct and save time and money

Well anyhow this critter Billings he aint never smelt salt water
afore and he dont like the smell He makes proclamations that Orham is
nothin but sand slush and soft drinks He wont sail he cant
swim he wont fish but hes hankerin to shoot somethin havin been
brought up in a place where if you dont shoot some of the neighbors
every day or so folks think youre stuck up and dissociable Then
somebody tells him its the duckin season down to Setuckit Pint and
he says hell spend his day off while the boss is away massycreein
the coots there This same somebody whispers that I know so much about
ducks that I quack when I talk and he comes cruisin over in the buzz
cart to hire me for guide Andwould you blieve itit turns out that
hes callatin to make his duckin vyage in that very cart I was for
makin the trip in a boat like a sensible man but he wouldnt hear of
it

Land of love says I Go to Setuckit in a automobile

Why not he says The biscuit shooter up at the hotel tells me
theres a smart chance of folks goes there ahorseback And where a hoss
can travel I reckon the old gal hereslappin the thwart of the auto
alongside of himcan go too

But theres the Cutthrough says I

Taint nothin but a creek when the freshets over they tell me
says he And me and the boss have forded four foot of river in this
very machine

By the freshet bein over I judged he meant the tide bein out And
the Cutthrough aint but a little trickle then though its a quarter
mile wide and deep enough to float a schooner at high water Its the
strip of channel that makes Setuckit Beach an island you know The
govment has had engineers down dredgin of it out and pretty soon fish
boatsll be able to save the twentymile sail around the Pint and into
Orham Harbor at all hours

Well to make a long story short I agreed to let him cart me to
Setuckit Pint in that everlastin gas carryall We was to start at four
oclock in the afternoon cause the tide at the Cutthrough would be
dead low at halfpast four Wed stay overnight at my shanty at the
Pint get up airly shoot all day and come back the next afternoon

At four prompt he was on hand ready for me I loaded in the guns and
grub and one thing or nother and then twas time for me to get aboard
myself

Youll set in the tonneau says he indicatin the upholstered after
cockpit of the concern I opened up the shiny hatch under orders from
him and climbed in among the upholstery Twas soft as a feather bed

Jerushy says I lollin back luxurious This is fine aint it

Cost seventyfive hundred to build he says casual Made to order
for the boss Lightest car of her speed ever turned out

Go way How you talk Seventyfive hundred what Not dollars

Sure he says Then he turns roundhe was in the bow hangin on to
the steerin wheeland looks me over kind of interested but superior
Say he says Ive been hearin things about you Youre a hero
aint you

Durn them Orham gabblers Ever sence I hauled that crew of seasick
summer boarders out of the drink a couple of years ago and the govment
gave me a medal the minister and some more of his gang have painted out
the name I was launched under and had me entered on the shippin list
as The Hero Ive licked two or three for callin me that but I cant
lick a parson and he was the one that told Billings

Oh I dont know I answers pretty sharp Get her under way why
dont you

All he done was look me over some more and grin

A hero A real live govmentbranded hero he says Aint scared of
nothin I reckonhey

I never made no answer Theres some things thats too fresh to eat
without salt and I didnt have a pickle tub handy

Hum he says again reverendlike A sure hero scared of nothin
Never rode in an auto afore did you

No says I peppery and I dont see no present symptom of ridin in
one now Cast off wont you

He cast off That is to say he hauled a nickelplated marlinespike
thing toward him shoved another one away from him took a twist on the
steerin wheel the gocart coughed like a horse with the heaves started
up some sort of buzzplaner underneath and then we begun to move

From the time we left my shanty at South Orham till we passed the pines
at Herrin Neck I laid back in that stuffed cockpit feelin as grand
and tainted as old John D himself The automobile rolled along smooth
but swift and it seemed to me I had never known what easy travlin was
afore As we rounded the bend by the pines and opened up the twelvemile
narrow white stretch of Setuckit Beach ahead of us with the ocean on
one side and the bay on tother I looked at my watch Wed come that
fur in thirteen minutes

Land sakes I says This is what I call movin right along

He turned round and sized me up again like he was surprised

Movin says he Movin Why pard weve been settin down to rest
Out our way if a lynchin party didnt move faster than weve done so
fur the center of attraction would die on the road of old age Now my
heroic college chum he goes on callin me out of my name as usual
will you be so condescendin as to indicate how we hit the trail

Hithit which Dont hit nothin for goodness sake Goin the way
we be it would

Which way do we go

Right straight ahead Keep on the ocean side cause theres more hard
sand there andhold on Dont do that Stop it I tell you

Them was the last rememberable words said by me durin the next quarter
of an hour That shover man let out a hairraisin yell hauled the
nickel marlinespike over in its rack and squeezed a rubber bag that was
spliced to the steerin wheel There was a half dozen toots or howls or
honks from under our bows somewheres and then that automobile hopped
off the ground and commenced to fly The fust hop landed me on my knees
in the cockpit and there I stayed Twas the most fittin position
fur my frame of mind and chimed in fustrate with the general religious
drift of my thoughts

The Cutthrough is two mile or more from Herrin Neck Cordin to my
count we hit terra cotta just three times in them two miles The fust
hit knocked my hat off The second one chucked me up so high I looked
back for the hat and though we was a half mile away from it it hadnt
had time to git to the ground And all the while the horn was ahonkin
and Billings was ascreechin and the sand was aflyin Sand Why
say Do you see that extra bald place on the back of my head Yes Well
there was a twoinch thatch of hair there afore that sand blast ground
it off

When I went up on the third jounce I noticed the Cutthrough just
ahead Billings see it too andwould you blieve itthe lunatic
stood up let go of the wheel with one hand takes off his hat and waves
it and we charge down across them wet tide flats like death on the
woolly horse in Scriptur

Hi yah Yip whoops Billings Come on in fellers The waters
fine Yow Yeee Yip

For a second it left off rainin sand and there was a typhoon of
mud and spray I see a million of the prettiest rainbowsthat is I
callated there was a million its awful hard to count when youre
bouncin and prayin and drowndin all to once Then we sizzed out of
the channel over the flats on tother side and on toward Setuckit

Never mind the rest of the ride Twas all a sort of constant changin
sameness I remember passin a blurred lifesavin station with
threeor maybe thirtyblurred men jumpin and laughin and hollerin
I found out afterwards that theyd been on the lookout for the bombshell
for half an hour Billings had told around town what he was goin to
do to me and some kind friend had telephoned it to the station So the
lifesavers was full of anticipations I hope they were satisfied I
hadnt rehearsed my part of the show none but I feel what the parson
calls a consciousness of havin done my best

Whoa gal says Billings calm and easy puttin the helm hard down
The auto was standin still at last Part of me was hangin over the lee
rail I could see out of the part so I knew twas my head And there
alongside was my fish shanty at the Pint goin round and round in
circles

I undid the hatch of the cockpit and fell out on the sand Then I
scrambled up and caught hold of the shanty as it went past me That fool
shover watched me seeminly interested

Why pard says he whats the matter Do you feel pale Are you
nervous It aint possible that youre scared Honest now pard if it
werent that I knew you were a genuine goldmounted hero Id sure think
you was a scared man

I never said nothin The scenery and me was just turnin the mark buoy
on our fourth lap

Dear me pard continues Billings I sure hope I aint scared you
none We come down a little slow this evenin but tomorrow night when
I take you back home Ill let the old girl out a little

I sensed some of that And as the shanty had about come to anchor I
answered and spoke my mind

When you take me back home I says When you do Why you
crackbrained murderin lunatic I wouldnt cruise in that hell wagon
of yours again for the skippers wages on a Cunarder No nor the mates
hove in

And that shover he put his head back and laughed and laughed and
laughed




CHAPTER XVI

THE CRUISE OF THE RED CAR


I dont wonder he laughed observed Wingate who seemed to enjoy
irritating his friend You must have been good as a circus

Humph grunted the depot master If I remember right you said YOU
want any tencent side show under similar circumstances Barzilla
Heave ahead Bailey

Captain Stitt unruffled resumed

I tell you I had to take it that evenin he said All the time I
was cookin and while he was eatin supper Billings was rubbin it
into me about my bein scared Called me all the saltwaterhero names
he could think ofHobson and Dewey and the like of that usin em
sarcastic of course Finally he said he remembered readin in school
when he was little about a girl hero name of Grace Darlin Said he
callated if I didnt mind hed call me Grace cause it was heroic
and yet kind of fitted in with my particlar brand of bravery I didnt
answer much he had me down and I knew it Likewise I judged he was
more or less out of his head no sane man would yell the way he done
aboard that automobile

Then he commenced to spin yarns about himself and his doins and
pretty soon it come out that hed been a cowboy afore young Stumpton
give up ranchin and took to automobilin That cleared the sky line
some of course Id read considerble about cowboys in the tencent
books my nephew fetched home when he was away to school I see right off
that Billings was the livin image of Deadwood Dick and Wild Bill and
the rest in them books they yelled and howled and hadnt no regard for
life and property any moren he had No sir He want no craziern
they was it was in the breed I judged

I sure wish I had you on the ranch Grace says he Why dont you
come West some day Thats where a hero like you would show up strong

Godfrey mighty I sings out I wouldnt come nigh such a nest of
crazy murderers as that fur no money Id sooner ride in that automobile
of yours and St Peter himself couldnt coax me into THAT again not if
twas fur a cruise plumb up the middle of the golden street

I meant it too and the next afternoon when it come time to start
for home he found out that I meant it Wed shot a lot of ducks and
Billings was havin such a good time that I had to coax and tease him
as if he was a young one afore hed think of quittin It was quarter
of six when he backed the gas cart out of the shed I was uneasy cause
twas past lowwater time and there was fog comin on

Brace up Dewey says he Get in

No Mr Billings says I I aint goin to get in You take that
craft of yourn home and Ill sail up alongside in my dory

In your which says he

In my dory I says Thats her hauled up on the beach abreast the
shanty

He looked at the dory and then at me

Go on says he You aint goin to pack yourself twelve mile on THAT
SHINGLE

Sartin I am says I I aint takin no more chances

Do you know he actually seemed to think I was crazy then Seemed to
figger that the dory want big enough and shes carried five easy
afore now We had an argument that lasted twenty minutes more and the
fog driftin in nigher all the time At last he got sick of arguin
ripped out somethin brisk and personal and got his tin shop to movin

You want to cross over to the ocean side I called after him The
Cutthroughs been dredged at the bay end remember

Be hanged he yells or more emphatic And off he whizzed I see him
go and fetched a long breath Thanks to a merciful Providence Id come
so fur without bein buttered on the undercrust of that automobile or
scalped with its crazy shovers bowie knife

Ten minutes later I was beatin out into the bay in my dory All
around was the fog thin as poorhouse gruel so fur but thickenin every
minute I was worried not for myself you understand but for that
cowboy shover I was afraid he wouldnt fetch tother side of the
Cutthrough There want much wind and I had to make long tacks I
took the inshore channel and kept listenin all the time And at last
when twas pretty dark and I was callatin to be about abreast of the
bay end of the Cutthrough I heard from somewheres ashore a dismal
honkin kind of noise same as a wild goose might make if twas chokin
to death and not resigned to the worst

My land says I Its happened And I come about and headed
straight in for the beach I struck it just alongside the govment
shanty The engineers had knocked off work for the week waitin for
supplies but they hadnt took away their dunnage

Hi I yells as I hauled up the dory Hiii Billings where be
you

The honkin stopped and back comes the answer there was joy in it

What Is that Capn Stitt

Yes I sings out Where be you

Im stuck out here in the middle of the crick And theres a flood on
Help me cant you

Next minute I was aboard the dory rowin her against the tide up the
channel Pretty quick I got where I could see him through the fog and
dark The auto was on the flat in the middle of the Cutthrough and
the water was hub high already Billings was standin up on the forard
thwart makin wet footmarks all over them expensive cushions

Lord says he I sure am glad to see you pard Can we get to land
do you think

Land says I makin the dory fast alongside and hoppin out into the
drink Course we can land Whats the matter with your old derelict
Sprung a leak has it

He went on to explain that the automobile had broke down when he struck
the flat and he couldnt get no farther Hed been honkin and howlin
for ten year at least so he reckoned

Why in time says I didnt you mind me and go up the ocean side
And why in nation didnt you go ashore andBut never mind that now Let
me think Here You set where you be

As I shoved off in the dory again he turned loose a distress signal

Where you goin he yells Say pard you aint goin to leave me
here are you

Ill be back in a shake says I layin to my oars Dont holler so
Youll have the lifesavers down here and then the jokell be on us
Hush cant you Ill be right back

I rowed up channel a little ways and then I sighted the place I
was bound for Them govment folks had another shanty farther up the
Cutthrough Moored out in front of it was a couple of big floats for
their stone sloops to tie up to at high water The floats were made of
empty kerosene barrels and planks and theyd have held up a house easy
I run alongside the fust one cut the anchor cable with my jackknife
and next minute I was navigatin that float down channel steerin it
with my oar and towin the dory astern

Twas no slouch of a job pilotin that big float but part by steerin
and part by polin I managed to land her broadside on to the auto I
made her fast with the cable ends and went back after the other float
This one was a bigger job than the fust but by and by that gas wagon
with planks under her and cable lashins holdin her firm was restin
easy as a settin hen between them two floats I unshipped my mast
fetched it aboard the nighest float and spread the sail over the
biggest part of the brasswork and upholstery

There says I if it rains durin the night shell keep pretty
dry Now Ill take the dory and row back to the shanty after some spare
anchors there is there

But whats it fur pard asks Billings for the nine hundred and
ninetyninth time Why dont we go where its dry The floods risin
all the time

Let it rise I says I callate when it gets high enough them
floatsll rise with it and lift the automobile up too If shes
anchored bow and stern shell hold unless it comes on to blow a gale
and tomorrow mornin at low tide maybe you can tinker her up so shell
go

Go says he like he was astonished Do you mean to say youre
reckonin to save the CAR

Good land I says starin at him What else dyou spose Think Id
let seventyfive hundred dollars wuth of giltedged extravagance go to
the bottom What did you callate I was tryin to savethe clam flat
Give me that dory rope Im goin after them anchors Sufferin snakes
Where IS the dory What have you done with it

Hed been holdin the bight of the dory rodin I handed it to him sos
hed have somethin to take up his mind And by time hed forgot all
about it and let it drop And the dory had gone adrift and was out of
sight

Gosh says he astonishedlike Pard the son of a gun has slipped
his halter

I was pretty maddories dont grow on every beach plum bushbut there
want nothin to say that fitted the case so I didnt try

Humph says I Well Ill have to swim ashore thats all and go up
to the station inlet after another boat You stand by the ship If she
gets afloat afore I come back you honk and holler and Ill row after
you Ill fetch the anchors and well moor her wherever she happens to
be If she shouldnt float on an even keel or goes to capsize you jump
overboard and swim ashore Ill

Swim says he with a shake in his voice Why pard I cant swim

I turned and looked at him Shover of a twomileaminute goldplated
butcher cart like that a cowboy murderer that et his friends for
breakfastand couldnt swim I fetched a kind of combination groan and
sigh turned back the sail climbed aboard the automobile and lit up my
pipe

What are you settin there for says he What are you goin to do

Do says I Wait thats allwait and smoke We wont have to wait
long

My prophesyin was good We didnt have to wait very long It was pitch
dark foggy as ever and the tide arisin fast The floats got to be
awash I shinned out onto em picked up the oar that had been left
there and took my seat again Billings climbed in too onlyand
it kind of shows the change sence the previous eveninhe was in the
passenger cockpit astern and I was forard in the pilot house For a
reckless daredevil he was actin mighty fidgety

And at last one of the floats swung off the sand The automobile tipped
scandalous It looked as if we was goin on our beam ends Billings let
out an awful yell Then tother float bobbed up and the whole shebang
car and all drifted out and down the channel

My lashins heldI callated they would Soons I was sure of that I
grabbed up the oar and shoved it over the stern between the floats I
hoped I could round her to after we passed the mouth of the Cutthrough
and make port on the inside beach But not in that tide Inside of five
minutes I see twas no use we was bound across the bay

And now commenced a vyage that beat any ever took sence Noahs time
I callate and even Noah never went to sea in an automobile though
the one animal I had along was as much trouble as his whole menagerie
Billings was howlin blue murder

Stop that bellerin I ordered Quit it dyou hear Youll have the
station crew out after us and theyll guy me till I cant rest Shut
up If you dont IllIll swim ashore and leave you

I was takin big chances as I look at it now He might have drawed a
bowie knife or a lasso on me cordin to his yarns hed butchered folks
for a good sight lessn that But he kept quiet this time only gurglin
some when the ark tilted I had time to think of another idee You
remember the dory sail mast and all was alongside that cart I clewed
up the canvas well as I could and managed to lash the mast up straight
over the autos bows Then I shook out the sail

Here says I turnin to Billings You hang on to that sheet No
you neednt nuther Make it fast to that cleat alongside

I couldnt see his face plain but his voice had a funny tremble to it
reminded me of my own when I climbed out of that very cart after hed
jounced me down to Setuckit the day before

What he says Whwhat What sheet I dont see any sheet What do
you want me to do

Tie this line to that cleat That cleat there CLEAT you lubber
CLEAT That knob MAKE IT FAST Oh my gosh tmighty Get out of my
way

The critter had tied the sheet to the handle of the door instead of the
one I meant and the pull of the sail hauled the door open and pretty
nigh ripped it off the hinges I had to climb into the cockpit and
straighten out the mess I was losin my temper I do hate bunglin
seamanship aboard a craft of mine

But whatll become of us begs Billings Will we drown

What in tunket do we want to drown for Aint we got a good sailin
breeze and the whole bay to stay on top offifty foot of water and
more

Fifty foot he yells Is there fifty foot of water underneath us
now Pard you dont mean it

Course I mean it Good thing too

But fifty foot Its enough to drown in ten times over

Cant drown but once can you And Id just as soon drown in fifty
foot as fourruther cause twouldnt take so long

He didnt answer out loud but I heard him talkin to himself pretty
constant

We was well out in the bay by now and the seas was a little mite more
ruggednothin to hurt you understand but the floats was all foam
and once in a while wed ship a little spray And every time that
happened Billings would jump and grab for somethin solidsometimes
twas the upholstery and sometimes twas me He want on the thwart
but down in a heap on the cockpit floor

Let go of my leg I sings out after wed hit a high wave and that
shover had made a moren ordinary savage claw at my underpinnin You
make me nervous Drat this everlastin fog somethinll bump into us if
we dont look out Here you go forard and light them cruisin lights
They aint colored cordin to regulations but theyll have to do Go
forard What you waitin for

Well it turned out that he didnt like to leave that cockpit I was
mad

Go forard there and light them lights I yelled hangin to the
steerin oar and keepin the ark runnin afore the wind

I wont he says loud and emphatic Think Im a blame fool I sure
would be a jack rabbit to climb over them seats the way theyre buckin
and light them lamps Youre talkin through your hat

Well I hadnt no business to do it but you see I was on salt water
and skipper as you might say of the junk we was afloat in and if
theres one thing I never would stand its mutiny I hauled in the oar
jumped over the cockpit rail and went for him He see me comin stood
up tried to get out of the way and fell overboard backwards Part of
him lit on one of the floats but the biggest part trailed in the water
between the two He clawed with his hands but the planks was slippery
and he slid astern fast Just as he reached the last plank and slid off
and under I jumped after him and got him by the scruff of the neck I
had hold of the lashin end with one hand and we tailed out behind the
ark which was sloppin along graceful as an elephant on skates

I was pretty well beat out when I yanked him into that cockpit
again Neither of us said anything for a spell breath bein scurce as
dimonds But when hed collected some of his he spoke

Pard he says puffin Im much obleeged to you I reckon I sure
aint treated you right If it hadnt been for you that time Id

But I was bilin over I whirled on him like a teetotum

Drat your hide I says When you speak to your officer you say sir
And now you go forard and light them lights Dont you answer back
If you do Ill fix you sos youll never ship aboard another vessel
Forard there Lively you lubber lively

He went forard takin considerble time and hangin on for dear life
But somehow or nuther he got the lights to goin and all the time
I hazed him terrible I was mate on an Australian packet afore I went
fishin to the Banks and I can haze some I blackguarded that shover
awful

Rippertyrip your everlastin blanketyblanked dough head I roared
at him You aint wuth the weight to sink you Forard there and get
that fog horn to goin And keep it goin Lively you sculpin Dont
you open your mouth to me

Well all night we sloshed along straight acrost the bay We must
have been a curious sight to look at The floats was awash so that the
automobile looked like she was ridin the waves all by her lonesome the
lamps was blazin at either side of the bow Billings was atootin
the rubber fog horn as if he was wound up and I was standin on the
cushions amidships keepin the whole calabash afore the wind

We never met another craft the whole night through Yes we did meet
one Old Ezra Cahoon of Harniss was out in his dory stealin quahaugs
from Seth Andrewss bed over nigh the Wapatomac shore Ezra stayed long
enough to get one good glimpse of us as we bust through the fog then he
cut his rodin and laid to his oars bound for home and mother We could
hear him screech for half an hour after he left us

Ez told next day that the devil had come ridin acrost the bay after
him in a chariot of fire Said he could smell the brimstone and hear
the trumpet callin him to judgment Likewise he hove in a lot of
particulars concernin the personal appearance of the Old Boy himself
who he said was standin up wavin a redhot pitchfork Some folks
might have been flattered at bein took for such a famous character but
I want Im retirin by nature and besides Ezs description
want callated to bust a bodys vanity biler I was prouder of the
consequences the same bein that Ezra signed the Good Templars pledge
that afternoon and kept it for three whole months just sixtynine days
longer than any previous attack within the memory of man had lasted

And finally just as mornin was breakin the bows of the floats slid
easy and slick up on a hard sandy beach Then the sun riz and the
fog lifted and there we was within sight of the South Ostable
meetinhouse Wed sailed eighteen miles in that ark and made a better
landin blindfold than we ever could have made on purpose

I hauled down the sail unshipped the mast and jumped ashore to find
a rock big enough to use for a makeshift anchor It want moren three
minutes after we fust struck afore my boots hit dry ground but Billings
beat me one hundred and seventy seconds at that When I had time to
look at that shover man he was a cables length from hightide mark
settin down and grippin a bunch of beach grass as if he was afeard the
sand was goin to slide from under him and you never seen a yallerer
more upset critter in your born days

Well I got the ark anchored after a fashion and then we walked up to
the South Ostable tavern Peleg Small who runs the place he knows me
so he let me have a room and I turned in for a nap I slept about three
hours When I woke up I started out to hunt the automobile and Billings
Both of em looked considerble better than they had when I see em
last The shover had got a gang of men and theyd got the gas cart
ashore and Billings and a blacksmith was workin overor rather
underthe clockwork

Hello I hails comin alongside

Billings sticks his head out from under the tinware

Hi pard says he I noticed he hadnt called me Grace nor Dewey
for a long spell Hi pard he says gettin to his feet the old gal
aint hurt a hair Shell be good as ever in a couple of hours Then you
and me can start for Orham

In HER says I

Sure he says

Not by a jugful says I emphatic Ill borrer a boat to get to
Orham in when Im ready to go You wont ketch me in that man killer
again and you can call me a coward all you want to

A coward says he You a coward AndWhy you was in that car all
night

Oh I says Last night was diffrent The thing was on water then
and when Ive got enough water underneath me I know Im safe

Safe he sings out SAFE Well bygosh Pard I hate to say it
but its the Lords truthyou had me doin my Now I lay mes

For a minute we looked at each other Then says I sort of thinkin out
loud I callate I says that whether a mans brave or not depends
considerble on whether hes used to his latitude Its all accordin
It lays in the bringin up as the duck said when the hen tried to
swim

He nodded solemn Pard says he I sure reckon youve called the
turn Lets shake hands on it

So we shook and   

Captain Bailey stopped short and sprang from his chair Theres my
train comin he shouted Goodby Sol So long Barzilla Keep away
from fortune tellers and pretty servant girls or YOULL be gettin
married pretty soon Goodby

He darted out of the waiting room and his companions followed Mr
Wingate having a few final calls to make left the station soon
afterwards and did not return until evening And that evening he heard
news which surprised him

As he and Captain Sol were exchanging a last handshake on the platform
Barzilla said

Well Sol Ive enjoyed loafin around here and yarnin with you same
as I always do Ill be over again in a month or so and well have some
more

The Captain shook his head I may not be here then Barzilla he
observed

take my place on the mornin of the twelfth thats two days off

Why Why SOL

Yes Keep mum about it IllIll let you know what I decide to do I
aint settled it myself yet Goodby Barzilla




CHAPTER XVII

ISSYS REVENGE


The following morning at nine oclock Issy McKay sat upon the heap of
rusty chain cable outside the blacksmiths shop at Denboro reading
as usual a love story Issy was taking a day off He had begged
permission of Captain Sol Berry the permission had been granted
and Issy had come over to Denboro the village eight miles above East
Harniss in his power dory or gasoline boat the Lady May The Lady
May was a relic of the time before Issy was assistant depot master when
he gained a precarious living by quahauging separating the reluctant
bivalve from its muddy house on the bay bottom with an iron rake the
handle of which was forty feet long Issy had been seized with a desire
to try quahauging once more hence his holiday The rake was broken
and he had put in at Denboro to have it fixed While the blacksmith was
busy Issy laboriously spelled out the harrowing chapters of Vivian
the Shop Girl or Lord Lyndhursts Lowly Love

A grinning freckled face peered cautiously around the corner of the
blacksmiths front fence Then an overripe potato whizzed through the
air and burst against the shop wall a few inches from the readers head
Issy jumped

Youyou everlastin young ones you he shouted fiercely If I
git my hands onto you youll wish youdI see you hidin behind that
fence

Two barefooted little figures danced provokingly in the roadway and two
shrill voices chanted in derision

 Is McKayIs McKay
 Makes the Injuns run away

Scalped anybody lately Issy

Alas for the indiscretions of youth The tale of Issys early expedition
in search of scalps and glory was known from one end of Ostable County
to the other It had made him famous in a way

If I git aholt of you kids Ill bet therell be some scalpin done
retorted the persecuted one rising from the heap of cable

A second potato burst like a bombshell on the shingles behind him
McKay was a good general in that he knew when it was wisest to retreat
Shoving the paper novel into his overalls pocket he entered the shop

Whats the matter Is inquired the grinning blacksmith Most people
grinned when they spoke to Issy Gittin too hot outside there was it
Why dont you tomahawk em and have em for supper

Humph grunted the offended quahauger Dont git gay now Jake
Larkin You hurry up with that rake

Oh all right Is Dont sculp ME I aint done nothin Whats the
news over to East Harniss

Oh I dont know Not much Sam Bartlett he started for Boston this
mornin

Who Sam Bartlett I want to know Thought he was down for six weeks
You sure about that Is

Course Im sure I was up to the depot and see him buy his ticket and
git on the cars

Did hey Humph So Sams gone Gertie Higgins still over to her Aunt
Hannahs at Trumet

Issy looked at his questioner Why yes he said suspiciously
I spose shes there Fact I know she is Pat Starkeys doin the
telegraphin while shes away What made you ask that

The blacksmith chuckled Oh nothin he said Hows her dads
dyspepsy Had any more of them sudden attacks of his I callate theyll
take the old man off some of these days wont they I hear the doctor
thinks theres more heart than stomach in them attacks

But the skipper of the Lady May was not to be put off thus What you
drivin at Jake he demanded Whats Sam Bartletts goin away got to
do with Gertie Higgins

In his eagerness he stepped to Mr Larkins side The blacksmith caught
sight of the novel in his customers pocket He snatched it forth

What you readin now Is he demanded More blood and brimstone
Vivy Ann the Shop Girl Gee Wow

You gimme that book Jake Larkin Gimme it now

Fending the frantic quahauger off with one mighty arm the blacksmith
proceeded to read aloud

Darlin cried Lord Lyndhurst strainin the beautiful and blushin
maid to his manly bosom you are mine at last Mine No Jerushy a
love story Why Issy I didnt know you was in love Whos the lucky
girl Send me an invite to your weddin wont you

Issys face was a fiery red He tore the precious volume from its
desecrators hand losing the pictured cover in the struggle

Youyou pesky fool he shouted You mind your own business

The blacksmith roared in glee Oh ho he cried Issys in love and
I never guessed it Aw say Is dont be mean Who is she Have you
strained her to your manly bosom yit Whats her name

Shut up shrieked Issy and strode out of the shop His tormentor
begged him not to go off mad and shouted sarcastic sympathy after
him But Mr McKay heeded not He stalked angrily along the sidewalk
Then espying just ahead of him the boys who had thrown the potatoes
he paused turned and walking down the carriageway at the side of the
blacksmiths place of business sat down upon a sawhorse under one of
its rear windows He could at least be alone here and think and he
wanted to think

For Issyalthough he didnt look itwas deeply interested in another
love story as well as that in his pocket This one was printed upon
his hearts pages and in it he was the hero while the heroinethe
unsuspecting heroinewas Gertie Higgins daughter of Beriah Higgins
once a fisherman now the crotchety and dyspeptic proprietor of the
general store and postmaster at East Harniss

This story began when Issy first acquired the Lady May The Higgins home
stood on the slope close to the boat landing and when Issy came in from
quahauging Gertie was likely to be in the back yard hanging out the
clothes or watering the flower garden Sometimes she spoke to him of her
own accord concerning the weather or other important topics Once
she even asked him if he were going to the Fourth of July ball at the
townhall It took him until the next morninglike other warriors Issy
was cursed with shynessto summon courage enough to ask her to go to
the ball with him Then he found it was too late she was going with
her cousin Lennie Bloomer But he felt that she had offered him the
opportunity and was happy and hopeful accordingly

This however was before she went to Boston to study telegraphy When
she returned with a picture hat and a Boston accent it was to preside
at the telegraph instrument in the little room adjoining the post office
at her fathers store When Issy bowed blushingly outside the window
of the telegraph room he received only the airiest of frigid nods Was
there what Lord Lyndhurst would have called another It would seem
not Old Mr Higgins her father encouraged no bows nor attentions from
young men and Gertie herself did not appear to desire them So Issy
gave up his tales of savage butchery for those of love and blisses
adored in silence and hopedalways hoped

But why had the blacksmith seemed surprised at the departure of Sam
Bartlett the dudey vacationist from the city whose father had years
ago been Beriah Higginss partner in the fish business And why had he
coupled the Bartlett name with that of Gertie who had been visiting her
fathers maiden sister at Trumet the village next below East Harniss
as Denboro is the next above it Issys suspicions were aroused and he
wondered

Suddenly he heard voices in the shop above him The window was open and
he heard them plainly

Well WELL It was the blacksmith who uttered the exclamation Why
Bartlett how be you What you doin over here Thought youd gone back
to Boston I heard you had

Slowly cautiously the astonished quahauger rose from the sawhorse and
peered over the window sill There were two visitors in the shop One
was Ed Burns proprietor of the Denboro Hotel and livery stable The
other was Sam Bartlett the very same who had left East Harniss that
morning bound ostensibly for Boston Issy sank back again and
listened

Yes yes he heard Sam say impatiently I know butsee here Jake
where can I hire a horse in this Godforsaken town

Well well Sam continued Larkin I was just figurin that Beriah
had got the best of you after all and youd had to give it up for this
time Thinks I its too bad Just because your dad and Beriah Higgins
had such a deuce of a row when they bust up in the fish trade its a
shame that he wont hark to your keepin compny with Gertie And you
doin so well makin twenty dollars a week up to the cityEd told me
thatand

Yes yes But never mind that Where can I get a horse Ive got to be
in Trumet by eight tonight sure

Trumet Why thats where Gertie is aint it

Look ahere Jake broke in the liverystable keeper Ill tell you
how tis Oh its all right Sam Jake knows the most of it I told
him He can keep his mouth shut and he dont like old crank Higgins any
bettern you and me do Jake Sam here and Gertie had fixed it up to run
off and git married tonight He was to pretend to start for Boston this
mornin Bought a ticket and all sos to throw Beriah off the scent
He was to get off the train here at Denboro and I was to let him have a
horse n buggy Then this afternoon he was goin to drive through the
wood roads around to Trumet and be at the Baptist Church there at eight
tonight sharp Gerties Aunt Hannah shes had her orders and bein as
big a crank as her brother she dont let the girl out of her sight But
theres a fair at the church and Aunties tendin a table Gertie she
steps out to the cloak room to git a handkerchief which shes forgot
see And she hops into Sams buggy and away they go to the ministers
After theyre once hitched Old Dyspepsy can go to pot and see the kittle
bile

Bully By gum thats fine Wont Beriah rip some hey

Yes but theres the dickens to pay Ive only got two horses in the
stable today The rest are let And the two Ive gotones old Bill
and he couldnt go twenty mile to save his hide And tothers the gray
mare and blamed if she didnt git cast last night and use up her off
hind leg sos she cant step And Sams GOT to have a horse Where can I
git one

Hum Have you tried Hayness

Yes yes And Lathrops and Eldredges Cant git a team for love nor
money

Sho And he cant go by train

What With Beriah postmaster at East Harniss and always nosin through
every train that stops there You cant fetch Trumet by train without
stoppin at East Harniss andWhat was that

I dont know What was it

Sounded like somethin outside that back winder

The two ran to the window and looked out All they saw was an overturned
sawhorse and two or three hens scratching vigorously

Guess twas the chickens most likely observed the blacksmith Then
striking his blackened palms together he exclaimed

By time Ive thought of somethin Is McKay is in town today Come
over in the Lady May Shes a gasoline boat Is would take Sam to Trumet
for two or three dollars Ill bet And hes such a fool head that he
wouldnt ask questions nor suspicion nothin Twould be fastern a
horse and enough sight less risky

And just then the fool head his brain whirling under its carroty
thatch was hurrying blindly up the main street bound somewhere he
wasnt certain where

A mushy apple exploded between his shoulders but he did not even turn
around So THIS was what the blacksmith meant This was why Mr Higgins
watched his daughter so closely This was why Gertie had been sent off
to Trumet She had met the Bartlett miscreant in Boston they had been
together there had fallen in love andHe gritted his teeth and shook
his fists almost in the face of old Deacon Pratt who knowing the
McKay penchant for slaughter had serious thoughts of sending for the
constable

Beriah Higgins must be warned of course but how To telegraph was
to put Pat Starkey in possession of the secret and Pat was too good a
friend of Gerties to be trusted There was no telephone at the store
Issy entered the combination grocery store and post office

Has the down mail closed yet he panted

The postmaster looked out of his little window

Yes he replied Why Got a letter you want to go Take it up to the
depot The trains due but taint here yit If you run you can make
it

Issy took a card from his pocket It was the business card of the firm
to whom he sold his quahaugs On the back of the card he wrote in pencil
as follows

Mr Beriah Higgins your daughter Gertrude is going to meet Saml
Bartlett at the Baptist Church in Trumet at 8 PM tonight and get
married to him LOOK OUT

After an instants consideration he signed it A True Friend this
being in emulation of certain heroes of the Deadwood Dick variety Then
he put the card into an envelope and ran at top speed to the railway
station The train came in as he reached the platform The baggage
master was standing in the door of his car

Here mister panted Issy Jest hand this letter to Beriah Higgins
when he takes the mail bag at East Harniss wont you Its mighty
important Dont forgit Thanks

The train moved off Issy stared after it grinning malevolently
Higgins would get that note in ample time to send word to the watchful
Aunt Hannah When the unsuspecting eloper reached the Trumet church it
would be the aunt not the niece who awaited him Still grinning Mr
McKay walked off the platform and into the arms of Ed Burns the stable
keeper and Sam Bartlett his loathed and favored rival

Here he is shouted Burns Now weve got him

The foiler of the plot turned pale Was his secret discovered But no
his captors began talking eagerly and gradually the sense of their
pleadings became plain They wanted himHIM of all peopleto convey
Bartlett to Trumet in the Lady May

You see its a business meetin urged Burns Sams got to be there
by haf past seven or hellhe wont win on the deal will you Sam
Say yes Issy thats a good feller Hell give youI dont knows he
wont give you five dollars

Ten cried Bartlett And Ill never forget it either Will you Is

A mighty No was trembling on Issys tongue But before it was uttered
Burns spoke again

McKays got the best boat in these parts he urged Shes got a
tiptop engine in her and

The word engine dropped into the whirlpool of Issys thoughts with a
familiar sound In the chapter of Vivian that he had just finished
the beautiful shopgirl was imprisoned on board the yacht of the
millionaire kidnaper while the hero in his own yacht was miles
astern But the heros faithful friend disguised as a stoker was
tampering with the villains engine A vague idea began to form in
Issys brain Once get the wouldbe eloper aboard the Lady May and
even though the warning note should remain undelivered he

Issy smiled and the ghastliness of that smile was unnoticed by his
companions

IIll do it he cried By mighty I WILL do it You be at the wharf
here at four oclock I wouldnt do it for everybody Sam Bartlett but
for you Id do considerble just now And I dont want your ten dollars
nuther


Doctoring an engine may be easy enoughin stories But to doctor a
gasoline engine so that it will run for a certain length of time and
THEN break down is not so easy Three oclock came and the problem was
still unsolved Issy the perspiration running down his face stood
up in the Lady Mays cockpit and looked out across the bay smooth and
glassy in the afternoon sun

The sky overhead was clear and blue but along the eastern and southern
horizon was a gray bank of cloud heaped in tumbled masses

A sunburned lobsterman in rubber boots and a souwester was smoking on
the wharf

What time you goin to start for home Is he asked

Oh in an hour or so was the absentminded reply

Humph Youd better cast off afore that or youll be fog bound Itll
be thickern dock mud toward sundown and youll fetch up in Waptomac
stead of East Harniss thout youve got a good compass

Oh my compass is all right began Issy and stopped short
The lobsterman made other attempts at conversation but they were
unproductive McKay was gazing at the growing fog bank and thinking
hard To doctor an engine may be difficult but to get lost in a fogHe
took the compass from the glasslidded binnacle by the wheel and
carrying it into the little cabin placed it in the cuddy forward

It was nearer five than four when the Lady May her engine barking
aggressively moved out of Denboro Harbor Mr Bartlett the passenger
had been on time and had fumed and fretted at the delay But Issy was
deliberation itself He had forgotten his quahaug rake and the lapse
of memory entailed a trip to the blacksmiths Then the gasoline tank
needed filling and the battery had to be overhauled

Are you sure you can make it queried Sam anxiously Its important
I tell you Mighty important

The skipper snorted in disgust Make it he repeated If the Lady May
cant make fourteen mile in two hourslet alone twon a hafthen I
dont know her Shes one of them boats you read about she is

The Cape makes a wide bend between Denboro and Trumet The distance
between these towns is twenty long curved miles over the road by water
it is reduced to a straight fourteen And midway between the two at the
center of the curve is East Harniss

The Lady May coughed briskly on There was no sea and she sent long
widening ripples from each side of her bow Bartlett leaning over the
rail gazed impatiently ahead Issy sprawled on the bench by the wheel
was muttering to himself Occasionally he glanced toward the east The
gray fog bank was now half way to the zenith and approaching rapidly
The eastern shore had disappeared

Is Hi Is What are you doing Dont kill him before my eyes

Issy came out of his trance with a start

Whatwhats that he asked His passenger was grinning broadly

What Kill who

Why the big chief or whoever you had under your knee just then
Youve been rolling your eyes and punching air with your fist for the
last five minutes I was getting scared Youre an unmerciful sinner
when you get started aint you Is Who was the victim that time Man
Afraid of Hot Water or who

The skipper scowled He shoved the fist into his pocket

Naw he growled Twant

So Not an Indian Then it must have been a white man Some fellow
after your girl perhaps Hey

The disconcerted Issy was speechless His companions chance shot had
scored a bullseye Sam whooped

Thats it he crowed Sure thing Give it to him Is Dont spare
him

Mr McKay chokingly admitted that he want goin to

Ho ho Thats the stuff But whos SHE Is When are you going to
marry her

Issy grunted spitefully You aint married yourselfnot yit he
observed with concealed sarcasm

The unsuspecting Bartlett laughed in triumph No he said Im not
thats a fact but maybe Im going to be some of these days It looked
pretty dubious for a while but now its all right

Tis hey Youre sure about that be you

Guess I am Great Scott whats that Fog

A damp breath blew across the boat The clouds covered the sky overhead
and the bay to port The fog was pouring like smoke across the water

Fog by thunder exclaimed Bartlett

Issy smiled Hum Yes tis fog aint it he observed

But whatll we do Itll be here in a minute wont it

Shouldnt be a mite surprised Looks s if twas here now

The fog came on It reached the Lady May passed over her and shut her
within gray wet walls It was impossible to see a length from her side
Sam swore emphatically The skipper was provokingly calm He stepped to
the engine bent over it and then returned to the wheel

What are you doing demanded Bartlett

Slowin down of course Cant run moren haf speed in a fog like
this Taint safe

Safe What do I care I want to get to Trumet

Yes Well maybe well git there if we have luck

You idiot Weve GOT to get there How can you tell which way to steer
Get your compass man get your compass

Aint got no compass was the sulky answer Left it to home

Why no you didnt I

I tell you I did Twas careless of me I know but

But I say you didnt When you went uptown after that quahaug rake I
explored this craft of yours some The compass is in that little closet
at the end of the cabin Ill get it

He rose to his feet Issy sprang forward and seized him by the arm

Set down he yelled Whos runnin this boat you or me

The astounded passenger stared at his companion

Why you are he replied But thats no reasonWhats the matter
with you anyway Have your dime novels driven you loony

Issy hesitated For a moment chagrin and rage at this sudden upset of
his schemes had gotten the better of his prudence But Bartlett was
taller than he and broad in proportion And valorexcept of the
imaginative brandwas not Issys strong point

There there Sam he explained smiling crookedly You mustnt mind
me Im sort of nervous I guess And you mustnt hop up and down in a
boat that way You set still and Ill fetch the compass

He stumbled across the cockpit and disappeared in the dusk of the cabin
Finding that compass took a long time Sam lost patience

Whats the matter he demanded Cant you find it Shall I come

No no screamed Issy vehemently Stay where you be Catch aholt of
that wheel Well be spinnin circles if you dont Im acomin

But it was another five minutes before he emerged from the cabin
carrying the compass box very carefully with both hands He placed it in
the binnacle and closed the glass lid

Twas catched in a bluefish line he explained All snarled up
twas

Sam peered through the glass at the compass

Thunder he exclaimed I should say we had spun around Instead of
north being off here where I thought it was its way out to the right
Queer how fogll mix a fellow up Trumets about northeast isnt it

Notheast by noths the course Keep her just there

The Lady May still at half speed kept on through the mist Time
passed The twilight made darker still by the fog deepened They lit
the lantern in order to see the compass card Issy had the wheel now
Sam was forward keeping a lookout and fretting at the delay

Its seven oclock already he cried For Heavens sake how late
will you be Ive got to be there by quarter of eight Dyou hear Ive
GOT to

Well were gittin there Cant expect to travel so fast with part of
the power off Youll be where youre goin full as soon as you want to
be I callate

And he chuckled

Another half hour and through the wet dimness a light flashed
vanished and flashed again Issy saw it and smiled grimly Bartlett saw
it and shouted

Whats that light he cried Did you see it There it is off
there

I see it Theres a light at Trumet Neck aint there

Humph Its been years since I was there but I thought Trumet light
was steady However

Aint that the wharf ahead

Sure enough out of the dark loomed the bulk of a small wharf with
catboats at anchor near it Higher up somewhere on the shore were the
lighted windows of a building

By thunder were here exclaimed Sam and drew a long breath

Issy shut off the power altogether and the Lady May slid easily up to
the wharf Feverishly her skipper made her fast

Yes sir he cried exultantly Were here And no Black Rover nor
anybody else ever done a better piece of steerin than that nuther

He clambered over the stringpiece right at the heels of his impatient
but grateful passenger Sams thanks were profuse and sincere

Ill never forget it Is he declared Ill never forget it And
youll have to let me pay you theWhat makes you shake so

Issy pulled his arm away and stepped back

Ill never forget it Is continued Sam IWhy What

He was standing at the shore end of the wharf gazing up at the lighted
windows They were those of a dwelling housean oldfashioned house
with a back yard sloping down to the landing

And then Issy McKay leaned forward and spoke in his ear

You bet you wont forgit it Sam Bartlett he crowed in trembling but
delicious triumph You bet you wont Ive fixed you just the same as
the Black Rover fixed the mutineers Run off with my girl will ye And
marry her will ye I

Sam interrupted him Why WHY he cried Thatsthats Gerties
house This isnt Trumet ITS EAST HARNISS

The next moment he was seized from behind The skippers arms were
around his waist and the skippers thin legs twisted about his own They
fell together upon the sand and as they rolled and struggled Issys
yells rose loud and high

Mr Higgins he shrieked Mr Higgins Come on Ive got him Ive
got the feller thats tryin to steal your daughter Come on Ive got
him Im hangin to him

A door banged open Some one rushed down the walk And then a girls
voice cried in alarm

What is it Who is it What IS the matter

And from the bundle of legs and arms on the ground two voices exclaimed
GERTIE

But where IS your father asked Sam Issy asked nothing He merely sat
still and listened

Why hes at Trumet At least I suppose he is Mrs Jonesshes gone
to telephone to him nowsays that he came home this morning with one
of those dreadful attacks of his And after dinner he seemed so sick
that when she went for the doctor she wired me at Aunties to come
home I didnt want to comeyou know whybut I COULDNT let him die
alone And so I caught the three oclock train and came I knew youd
forgive me But it seems that when Mrs Jones came back with the doctor
they found father up and dressed and storming like a crazy man He had
received some sort of a letter he wouldnt say what And in spite of
all they could do he insisted on going out And Capn Berrythe depot
mastersays he went to Trumet on the afternoon freight We must have
passed each other on the way And Im soBut why are you HERE And what
were you and Issy doing And

Her lover broke in eagerly Then youre alone now he asked

CHAPTER XVIII

THE MOUNTAIN AND MAHOMET


The eleventh of July The little Berry house stood high on its joists
and rollers in the middle of the Hill Boulevard directly opposite
the Edwards lot Close behind it loomed the big Colonial Another
twentyfour hours and even at its onehorse gait the depot masters
dwelling would be beyond the strip of Edwards fence The Colonial
would be ready to move on the lot and Olive Edwards the widow would
be obliged to leave her home In fact Mr Williams had notified
her that she and her few belongings must be off the premises by the
afternoon of the twelfth

The great Williams was in high goodhumor He chuckled as he talked with
his foreman and the foreman chuckled in return Simeon Phinney did
not chuckle He was anxious and worried and even the news of Gertie
Higginss runaway marriage brought to him by Obed Gott whohaving
been so recently the victim of another unexpected matrimonial
alliancewas wickedly happy over the postmasters discomfiture did not
interest him greatly

Well I wonder wholl be the next couple speculated Obed First
Polena and old Hardee then Gertie Higgins and Sam Bartlett I declare
Sim gettin married unbeknownst to anybody must be catchin like the
measles Nobodys safe unless theyve got a wife or husband livin Me
and Sol Berry are old bacheswed better get vaccinated or WE may come
down with the disease Ho ho

After dinner Mr Phinney went from his home to the depot Captain Sol
was sitting in the ticket office with the door shut On the platform
forlornly sprawled upon the baggage truck was Issy McKay the picture
of desolation He started nervously when he heard Simeons step As
yet Issys part in the BartlettHiggins episode was unknown to the
townspeople Sam and Gertie had considerately kept silence Beriah had
not learned who sent him the warning note the unlucky missive which had
brought his troubles to a climax But he was bound to learn it he would
find out soon and thenNo wonder Issy groaned

Come in here Sim said the depot master Phinney entered the ticket
office

Shut the door commanded the Captain The order was obeyed Well
what is it asked Berry

Why I just run in to see you a minute Sol thats all What are you
shut up in here all alone for

Cause I want to be alone Theres been more than a thousand folks in
this depot so far today seems so and they all wanted to talk I dont
feel like talkin

Heard about Gertie Higgins and

Yes

Who told you

Hiram Baker told me first Hes a fine feller and hes so tickled now
that his youngsters most well that he cruises around spoutin talk
and joy same as a steamers stack spouts cinders He told me Then Obed
Gott and Cornelius Rowe and Redny Blount and Pat Starkey and land knows
how many more came to tell me I cut em short Why even the Major
himself condescended to march in grand and imposin as a procession to
make proclamations about love laughin at locksmiths and so on Since
he got Polena and her bank account hes a bigger man than the President
in his own estimate

Humph Well he better make the best of it while it lasts Plena aint
Hetty Green and her money wont hold out forever

Thats a fact Still Polenas got sense Shell hold Hardee in check
I callate I wouldnt wonder if it ended by her bossin things and the
Major actin as a sort of pet poodle dognice and pretty to walk out
with but always kept at the end of a string

You didnt go to Higginss for dinner today did you

No Nor I shant go for supper Beriahs bad enough when hes got
nothin the matter with him but dyspepsy Now that his sufferins are
complicated with elopements I dont want to eat with him

Come and have supper with us

I guess not thank you Sim Ill get some crackers and cheese and such
at the store II aint very hungry these days

He turned his head and looked out of the window Simeon fidgeted

Sol he said after a pause well be past Olives by tomorrer
night

No answer Sim repeated his remark

I know it was the short reply

Yesyes I sposed you did but

Sim dont bother me now This is my last day here at the depot and
Ive got things to do

Your last day Why what

Captain Sol told briefly of his resignation and of the coming of the new
depot master

But you givin up your job gasped Phinney YOU Why what for

For instance I guess I aint dependent on the wages and Im sick of
the whole thing

But whatll you do

Dont know

Youyou wont leave town will you Lawsy mercy I hope not

Dont know Maybe Ill know better by and by Ive got to think things
out Run along now like a good feller Dont say nothin about my
quittin All handsll know it tomorrow and thats soon enough

Simeon departed his brain in a whirl Captain Solomon Berry no longer
depot master The world must be coming to an end

He remained at his work until supper time During the meal he ate and
said so little that his wife wondered and asked questions To avoid
answering them he hurried out When he returned about ten oclock he
was a changed man His eyes shone and he fairly danced with excitement

Emeline he shouted as he burst into the sitting room What do you
think Ive got the everlastinest news to tell

Good or bad asked the practical Mrs Phinney

Good So good thatThere let me tell you When I left here I went
down to the store and hung around till the mail was sorted Pat Starkey
was doin the sortin Beriah bein too upsot by Gerties gettin
married to attend to anything Pat called me to the mail window and
handed me a letter

Its for Olive Edwards he says Shes been expectin one for a
considerble spell she told me and maybe this is it Praps youd
just as soon go round by her shop and leave it

I took the letter and looked at it Up in one corner was the printed
name of an Omaha firm I never said nothin but I sartinly hustled on
my way up the hill

Olive was in her little settin room back of the shop She was pretty
pale and her eyes looked as if she hadnt been doin much sleepin
lately Likewise I noticedand it give me a queer feelin insidethat
her trunk was standin partly packed in the corner

The poor woman exclaimed Mrs Phinney

Yes went on her husband Well I handed over the letter and started
to go but she told me to set down and rest cause I was so out of
breath To tell you the truth I was crazy to find out what was in that
envelope and being as shed give me the excuse I set

She took the letter over to the lamp and looked at it for much as
a minute as if she was afraid to open it But at last and with her
fingers shakin like the palsy she fetched a long breath and tore off
the end of the envelope It was a pretty long letter and she read it
through I see her face gettin whiter and whiter and when she reached
the bottom of the last page the letter fell onto the floor Down went
her head on her arms and she cried as if her heart would break I never
felt so sorry for anybody in my life

Dont Mrs Edwards I says Please dont That cousin of yours is
a darn ungrateful scamp and Id like to have my claws on his neck this
minute

She never even asked me how I knew about the cousin She was too much
upset for that

Oh oh she sobs What SHALL I do Where shall I go I havent got a
friend in the world

I couldnt stand that I went acrost and laid my hand on her shoulder

Mrs Edwards says I you mustnt say that Youve got lots of
friends Im your friend Mr Hiltons your friend Yes and theres
another the best friend of all If it werent for him youd have been
turned out into the street long before this

Mrs Phinney nodded Im glad you told her she exclaimed Shed
ought to know

Thats what I thought said Simeon

Well she raised her head then and looked at me

You mean Mr Williams she asks

That riled me up Williams nothin says I Williams let you stay
here cause he could just as well as not If hed known that this other
friend was keepin him from gettin here just on your account hed
have chucked you to glory promise or no promise But this friend this
real friend he dont count cost nor trouble nor inconvenience Hikes
his housethe house he lives inright out into the road moves it to a
place where he dont want to go and

Mr Phinney she sighs out what do you mean

And then I told her She listened without sayin a word but her eyes
kept gettin brighter and brighter and she breathed short

Oh she says when Id finished Did hedid hedo that for ME

You bet says I He didnt tell me what he was doin it forthat
aint Sols style but Im arithmetiker enough to put two and two
together and make four He did it for you you can bet your last red on
that

She stood up Oh she breathes II must go and thank him I

But knowin Sol I was afraid Fust place there was no tellin how
hed act and besides he might not take it kindly that Id told her

Wait a jiffy I says Ill go out and see if hes home You stay
here Ill be back right off

Out I put and over to the Berry house standin on its rollers in the
middle of the Boulevard And just as I got to it somebody says

Ahoy Sim Whats the hurry Anybody on fire

Twas the Capn himself settin on a pile of movin joist and smokin
as usual I didnt waste no time

Sol says I Ive just come from Olives Shes got that letter from
the Omaha man Poor thing all alone there

He interrupted me sharp Well he snaps Whats it say Will the
cousin help her

No I says drat him he wont

The answer I got surprised me moren anything I ever heard or ever will
hear

Thank God says Sol Berry That settles it

And I swan to man if he didnt climb down off them timbers and march
straight across the street over to the door of Olive Edwardss home
open it and go in I leaned against the joist hed left and swabbed my
forehead with my sleeve

He went to HER gasped Mrs Phinney

Wait continued her husband I must have stood there twenty minutes
when I heard somebody hurryin down the Boulevard Twas Cornelius Rowe
all redfaced and het up but bustin with news

Lo Sim says he to me Is Capn Sol home Does he know

Know Know what says I

Why the trick Mr Williams put up on him Hey You aint heard Well
Mr Williamss fixed him nice HE has Seems Abner Payne hadnt answered
Sols letter tellin him hed accept the offer to swap lots and
Williams went up to Wareham where Paynes been stayin and offered him a
thumpin price for the land on Main Street and took it The deeds all
made out Capn Sol cant move where he was goin to and hes left with
his house on the town as you might say Aint it a joke though Where
is Sol I want to be the fust to tell him and see how he acts Is he to
home

I was shook pretty nigh to pieces but I had some sense left

No he aint says I I see him go up street a spell ago

Why Simeon interrupted Mrs Phinney once more Was that true How
COULD you see him when

Be still Spose I was goin to tell him where Sol HAD gone Id have
lied myself blue fust However Cornelius was satisfied

That so he grunts By jings Im goin to find him

Off he went and the next thing I knew the Edwards door opened and
I heard somebody callin my name I went acrost walkin in a kind of
daze and there in the doorway with the lamp shinin on em was Capn
Sol and Olive The tears was wet on her cheeks but she was smilin in
a kind of shy halfbelievin sort of way and as for Sol he was one
broad satisfied grin

Capn I begun I just heard the everlastinest news that

Shut up Sim he orders cheerful Youve been a mighty good friend
to both of us and I want you to be the fust to shake hands

Shake hands I stammers lookin at em WHAT You dont mean

I mean shake hands Dont you want to

Want to I give em both one more look and then we shook up to the
elbows and my grin had the Capns beat holler

Sim he says after Id cackled a few minutes I callate maybe that
white horse is well by this time Praps we might move a little faster
Im kind of anxious to get to Main Street

Then I remembered Great gosh all fishhooks I sings out Main
Street Why there AINT no Main Street

And I gives em Corneliuss news The widows smile faded out

Oh says she O Solomon And I got you into all this trouble

Capn Sol didnt stop grinnin but he scratched his head Huh says
he Mark one up for King Williams the Great Humph

He thought for a minute and then he laughed out loud Olive he says
if I remember right you and I always figgered to live on the Shore
Road Its the best site in town Sim I guess if that white horse IS
well you can move that shanty of mine right to Cross Street down that
and back along the Shore Road to the place where it come from THAT
lands mine yet says he

If that want him all over I couldnt think what to say except that
folks would laugh some I callated

Not at us they wont says he Well clear out till the laughin is
over Olive tomorrer mornin well call on Parson Hilton and then take
the ten oclock train I feels if a trip to Washinton would be about
right just now

She started and blushed and then looked up into his face Solomon
she says low I really would like to go to Niagara

He shook his head Old lady says he I guess you dont quite
understand this thing See herepintin to his house loomin big and
black in the roadwaysee the mountain has come to Mahomet

Mrs Phinney had heard enough She sprang from her chair and seized her
husbands hands

Splendid she cried her face beaming Oh AINT it lovely Aint you
glad for em Simeon

Glad Say Emeline theres some of that wildcherry bounce down
cellar aint there Lets break our teetotalism for once and drink a
glass to Capn and Mrs Solomon Berry Jerushy I got to do SOMETHIN to
celebrate


On the Hill Boulevard the summer wind stirred the silverleaf poplars
The thick black shadows along the sidewalks were heavy with the perfume
of flowers Captain Sol exdepot master of East Harniss strolled on
in the dark under the stars his hands in his pockets and in his heart
happiness complete and absolute

Behind him twinkled the lamp in the window of the Edwards house so soon
to be torn down Before him over the barberry hedge blazed the windows
of the mansion the owner of which was responsible for it all The
windows were open and through them sounded the voices of the mighty
Ogden Hapworth Williams and his wife engaged in a lively altercation
It was an open secret that their married life was anything but peaceful

What are you grumbling about now demanded Williams Dont I give
you more money than

Nonsense sneered Mrs Williams in scornful derision Nonsense
I say Money is all there is to you Ogden In other things the real
things of this world those you cant buy with money youre a perfect
imbecile You know nothing whatever about them

Captain Sol alone on the walk by the hedge glanced in the direction
of the shrill voice then back at the lamp in Olives window And he
laughed aloud
