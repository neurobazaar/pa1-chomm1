QUALITY

I knew him from the days of my extreme youth because he made my fathers
boots inhabiting with his elder brother two little shops let into one
in a small bystreetnow no more but then most fashionably placed in the
West End

That tenement had a certain quiet distinction there was no sign upon its
face that he made for any of the Royal Familymerely his own German name
of Gessler Brothers and in the window a few pairs of boots I remember
that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the
window for he made only what was ordered reaching nothing down and it
seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit
Had he bought them to put there That too seemed inconceivable He
would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not
worked himself Besides they were too beautifulthe pair of pumps so
inexpressibly slim the patent leathers with cloth tops making water
come into ones mouth the tall brown riding boots with marvellous sooty
glow as if though new they had been worn a hundred years Those pairs
could only have been made by one who saw before him the Soul of Bootso
truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all footgear
These thoughts of course came to me later though even when I was
promoted to him at the age of perhaps fourteen some inkling haunted me
of the dignity of himself and brother For to make bootssuch boots as
he madeseemed to me then and still seems to me mysterious and
wonderful

I remember well my shy remark one day while stretching out to him my
youthful foot

Isnt it awfully hard to do Mr Gessler

And his answer given with a sudden smile from out of the sardonic
redness of his beard Id is an Ardt

Himself he was a little as if made from leather with his yellow crinkly
face and crinkly reddish hair and beard and neat folds slanting down
his cheeks to the corners of his mouth and his guttural and onetoned
voice for leather is a sardonic substance and stiff and slow of
purpose And that was the character of his face save that his eyes
which were greyblue had in them the simple gravity of one secretly
possessed by the Ideal His elder brother was so very like himthough
watery paler in every way with a great industrythat sometimes in
early days I was not quite sure of him until the interview was over
Then I knew that it was he if the words I will ask my brudder had
not been spoken and that if they had it was his elder brother

When one grew old and wild and ran up bills one somehow never ran them
up with Gessler Brothers It would not have seemed becoming to go in
there and stretch out ones foot to that blue ironspectacled glance
owing him for more thansaytwo pairs just the comfortable reassurance
that one was still his client

For it was not possible to go to him very oftenhis boots lasted
terribly having something beyond the temporarysome as it were
essence of boot stitched into them

One went in not as into most shops in the mood of Please serve me
and let me go but restfully as one enters a church and sitting on
the single wooden chair waitedfor there was never anybody there
Soon over the top edge of that sort of wellrather dark and smelling
soothingly of leatherwhich formed the shop there would be seen his
face or that of his elder brother peering down A guttural sound and
the tiptap of bast slippers beating the narrow wooden stairs and he
would stand before one without coat a little bent in leather apron
with sleeves turned back blinkingas if awakened from some dream of
boots or like an owl surprised in daylight and annoyed at this
interruption

And I would say How do you do Mr Gessler Could you make me a pair
of Russia leather boots

Without a word he would leave me retiring whence he came or into the
other portion of the shop and I would continue to rest in the wooden
chair inhaling the incense of his trade Soon he would come back
holding in his thin veined hand a piece of goldbrown leather With eyes
fixed on it he would remark What a beaudiful biece When I too had
admired it he would speak again When do you wand dem And I would
answer Oh As soon as you conveniently can And he would say
Tomorrow fordnighd Or if he were his elder brother I will ask my
brudder

Then I would murmur Thank you Goodmorning Mr Gessler
Gootmorning he would reply still looking at the leather in his hand
And as I moved to the door I would hear the tiptap of his bast slippers
restoring him up the stairs to his dream of boots But if it were some
new kind of footgear that he had not yet made me then indeed he would
observe ceremonydivesting me of my boot and holding it long in his
hand looking at it with eyes at once critical and loving as if
recalling the glow with which he had created it and rebuking the way in
which one had disorganized this masterpiece Then placing my foot on a
piece of paper he would two or three times tickle the outer edges with a
pencil and pass his nervous fingers over my toes feeling himself into
the heart of my requirements

I cannot forget that day on which I had occasion to say to him Mr
Gessler that last pair of town walkingboots creaked you know

He looked at me for a time without replying as if expecting me to
withdraw or qualify the statement then said

Id shouldnd ave greaked

It did Im afraid

You goddem wed before dey found demselves

I dont think so

At that he lowered his eyes as if hunting for memory of those boots and
I felt sorry I had mentioned this grave thing

Zend dem back he said I will look at dem

A feeling of compassion for my creaking boots surged up in me so well
could I imagine the sorrowful long curiosity of regard which he would
bend on them

Zome boods he said slowly are bad from birdt If I can do noding
wid dem I dake dem off your bill

Once once only I went absentmindedly into his shop in a pair of boots
bought in an emergency at some large firms He took my order without
showing me any leather and I could feel his eyes penetrating the
inferior integument of my foot At last he said

Dose are nod my boods

The tone was not one of anger nor of sorrow not even of contempt but
there was in it something quiet that froze the blood He put his hand
down and pressed a finger on the place where the left boot endeavouring
to be fashionable was not quite comfortable

Id urds you dere he said Dose big virms ave no selfrespect
Drash And then as if something had given way within him he spoke
long and bitterly It was the only time I ever heard him discuss the
conditions and hardships of his trade

Dey get id all he said dey get id by adverdisement nod by work Dey
dake it away from us who lofe our boods Id gomes to thisbresently I
haf no work Every year id gets less you will see And looking at his
lined face I saw things I had never noticed before bitter things and
bitter struggleand what a lot of grey hairs there seemed suddenly in
his red beard

As best I could I explained the circumstances of the purchase of those
illomened boots But his face and voice made so deep impression that
during the next few minutes I ordered many pairs Nemesis fell They
lasted more terribly than ever And I was not able conscientiously to go
to him for nearly two years

When at last I went I was surprised to find that outside one of the two
little windows of his shop another name was painted also that of a
bootmakermaking of course for the Royal Family The old familiar
boots no longer in dignified isolation were huddled in the single
window Inside the now contracted well of the one little shop was more
scented and darker than ever And it was longer than usual too before
a face peered down and the tiptap of the bast slippers began At last
he stood before me and gazing through those rusty iron spectacles
said

Mr isnd it

Ah Mr Gessler I stammered but your boots are really too good
you know See these are quite decent still And I stretched out to
him my foot He looked at it

Yes he said beople do nod wand good hoods id seems

To get away from his reproachful eyes and voice I hastily remarked What
have you done to your shop

He answered quietly Id was too exbensif Do you wand some boods

I ordered three pairs though I had only wanted two and quickly left I
had I do not know quite what feeling of being part in his mind of a
conspiracy against him or not perhaps so much against him as against his
idea of boot One does not I suppose care to feel like that for it
was again many months before my next visit to his shop paid I remember
with the feeling Oh well I cant leave the old boyso here goes
Perhaps itll be his elder brother

For his elder brother I knew had not character enough to reproach me
even dumbly

And to my relief in the shop there did appear to be his elder brother
handling a piece of leather

Well Mr Gessler I said how are you

He came close and peered at me

I am breddy well he said slowly but my elder brudder is dead

And I saw that it was indeed himselfbut how aged and wan And never
before had I heard him mention his brother Much shocked I murmured
Oh I am sorry

Yes he answered he was a good man he made a good bood but he is
dead And he touched the top of his head where the hair had suddenly
gone as thin as it had been on that of his poor brother to indicate I
suppose the cause of death He could nod ged over losing de oder shop
Do you wand any hoods And he held up the leather in his hand Ids a
beaudiful biece

I ordered several pairs It was very long before they camebut they
were better than ever One simply could not wear them out And soon
after that I went abroad

It was over a year before I was again in London And the first shop I
went to was my old friends I had left a man of sixty I came back to
one of seventyfive pinched and worn and tremulous who genuinely this
time did not at first know me

Oh Mr Gessler I said sick at heart how splendid your boots are
See Ive been wearing this pair nearly all the time Ive been abroad
and theyre not half worn out are they

He looked long at my bootsa pair of Russia leather and his face seemed
to regain steadiness Putting his hand on my instep he said

Do dey vid you here I ad drouble wid dat bair I remember

I assured him that they had fitted beautifully

Do you wand any boods he said I can make dem quickly id is a slack
dime

I answered Please please I want boots all roundevery kind

I will make a vresh model Your food must be bigger And with utter
slowness he traced round my foot and felt my toes only once looking up
to say

Did I dell you my brudder was dead

To watch him was painful so feeble had he grown I was glad to get away

I had given those boots up when one evening they came Opening the
parcel I set the four pairs out in a row Then one by one I tried them
on There was no doubt about it In shape and fit in finish and
quality of leather they were the best he had ever made me And in the
mouth of one of the Town walkingboots I found his bill

The amount was the same as usual but it gave me quite a shock He had
never before sent it in till quarter day I flew downstairs and wrote
a cheque and posted it at once with my own hand

A week later passing the little street I thought I would go in and tell
him how splendidly the new boots fitted But when I came to where his
shop had been his name was gone Still there in the window were the
slim pumps the patent leathers with cloth tops the sooty riding boots

I went in very much disturbed In the two little shopsagain made into
onewas a young man with an English face

Mr Gessler in I said

He gave me a strange ingratiating look

No sir he said no But we can attend to anything with pleasure
Weve taken the shop over Youve seen our name no doubt next door
We make for some very good people

Yes Yes I said but Mr Gessler

Oh he answered dead

Dead But I only received these boots from him last Wednesday week

Ah he said a shockin go Poor old man starved imself

Good God

Slow starvation the doctor called it You see he went to work in such
a way Would keep the shop on wouldnt have a soul touch his boots
except himself When he got an order it took him such a time People
wont wait He lost everybody And there hed sit goin on and onI
will say that for him not a man in London made a better boot But look
at the competition He never advertised Would ave the best leather
too and do it all imself Well there it is What could you expect
with his ideas

But starvation

That may be a bit flowery as the sayin isbut I know myself he was
sittin over his boots day and night to the very last You see I used
to watch him Never gave imself time to eat never had a penny in the
house All went in rent and leather How he lived so long I dont know
He regular let his fire go out He was a character But he made good
boots

Yes I said he made good boots

And I turned and went out quickly for I did not want that youth to know
that I could hardly see
1911




THE GRAND JURYIN TWO PANELS AND A FRAME

Read that piece of paper which summoned me to sit on the Grand Jury at
the approaching Sessions lying in a scoop of the shore close to the
great rollers of the seathat span of eternal freedom deprived just
there of too great liberty by the word Atlantic And I remember
thinking as I read that in each breaking wave was some particle which
had visited every shore in all the worldthat in each sparkle of hot
sunlight stealing that bright water up into the sky was the microcosm of
all change and of all unity


PANEL I

In answer to that piece of paper I presented myself at the proper place
in due course and with a certain trepidation What was it that I was
about to do For I had no experience of these things And being too
early I walked a little to and fro looking at all those my partners in
this matter of the purification of Society Prosecutors witnesses
officials policemen detectives undetected pressmen barristers
loafers clerks cadgers jurymen And I remember having something of
the feeling that one has when one looks into a sink without holding ones
nose There was such uneasy hurry so strange a disenchanted look a
sort of spiritual dirt about all that place and there werefaces And
I thought To them my face must seem as their faces seem to me

Soon I was taken with my accomplices to have my name called and to be
sworn I do not remember much about that process too occupied with
wondering what these companions of mine were like but presently we all
came to a long room with a long table where nineteen lists of
indictments and nineteen pieces of blotting paper were set alongside
nineteen pens We did not I recollect speak much to one another but
sat down and studied those nineteen lists We had eightyseven cases on
which to pronounce whether the bill was true or no and the clerk assured
us we should get through them in two days at most Over the top of these
indictments I regarded my eighteen fellows There was in me a hunger of
inquiry as to what they thought about this business and a sort of
sorrowful affection for them as if we were all a ships company bound on
some strange and awkward expedition I wondered till I thought my
wonder must be coming through my eyes whether they had the same curious
sensation that I was feeling of doing something illegitimate which I
had not been born to do together with a sense of selfimportance a sort
of unholy interest in thus dealing with the lives of my fellow men And
slowly watching them I came to the conclusion that I need not wonder
All with the exception perhaps of two a painter and a Jew looked such
good citizens I became gradually sure that they were not troubled with
the lap and wash of speculation unclogged by any devastating sense of
unity pure of doubt and undefiled by an uneasy conscience

But now they began to bring us in the evidence They brought it quickly
And at first we looked at it whatever it was with a sort of solemn
excitement Were we not arbiters of mens fates purifiers of Society
more important by far than Judge or Common Jury For if we did not bring
in a true bill there was an end the accused would be discharged

We set to work slowly at first then faster and still faster bringing
in true bills and after every one making a mark in our lists so that we
might know where we were We brought in true bills for burglary and
false pretences larceny and fraud we brought them in for manslaughter
rape and arson When we had ten or so two of us would get up and bear
them away down to the Court below and lay them before the Judge Thank
you gentlemen he would say or words to that effect and we would go
up again and go on bringing in true bills I noticed that at the
evidence of each fresh bill we looked with a little less excitement and
a little less solemnity making every time a shorter tick and a shorter
note in the margin of our lists All the bills we hadfiftysevenwe
brought in true And the morning and the afternoon made that day till we
rested and went to our homes

Next day we were all back in our places at the appointed hour and not
greeting each other much at once began to bring in bills We brought
them in not quite so fast as though some lurking megrim some microbe
of dissatisfaction with ourselves was at work within us It was as if we
wanted to throw one out as if we felt our work too perfect And
presently it came A case of defrauding one Sophie Liebermann or
Laubermann or some such foreign name by giving her one of those
fivepound Christmascard banknotes just then in fashion and receiving
from her as she alleged three real sovereigns change There was a
certain piquancy about the matter and I well remember noticing how we
sat a little forward and turned in our seats when they brought in the
prosecutrix to give evidence Pale selfpossessed dressed in black and
rather comely neither brazen nor furtive speaking but poor English her
broad matteroffact face with its wideset grey eyes and thickish nose
and lips made on me I recollect an impression of rather stupid
honesty I do not think they had told us in so many words what her
calling was nor do I remember whether she actually disclosed it but by
our demeanour I could tell that we had all realized what was the nature
of the service rendered to the accused in return for which he had given
her this worthless note In her rather guttural but pleasant voice she
answered all our questionsnot very far from tears I think but saved
by native stolidity and perhaps a little by the fear that purifiers of
Society might not be the proper audience for emotion When she had left
us we recalled the detective and still as it were touching the
delicate matter with the tips of our tongues so as not being men of the
world to seem biassed against anything we definitely elicited from him
her profession and these words If shes speaking the truth gentlemen
but as you know these women they dont always specially the foreign
ones When he too had gone we looked at each other in unwonted
silence None of us quite liked it seemed to be first to speak Then
our foreman said Theres no doubt I think that he gave her the
notemean trick of course but we cant have him on that alonebit too
irregularno consideration in law I take it

He smiled a little at our smiles and then went on The question
gentlemen really seems to be are we to take her word that she actually
gave him change Again for quite half a minute we were silent and
then the fattest one of us said suddenly Very dangerousgoin on the
word of these women

And at once as if he had released something in our souls we all save
two or three broke out It wouldnt do It wasnt safe Seeing what
these women were It was exactly as if without word said we had each
been swearing the other to some secret compact to protect Society As if
we had been whispering to each other something like this These
womenof course we need them but for all that we cant possibly
recognise them as within the Law we cant do that without endangering
the safety of every one of us In this matter we are trustees for all
menindeed even for ourselves for who knows at what moment we might
not ourselves require their services and it would be exceedingly awkward
if their word were considered the equal of our own Not one of us
certainly said anything so crude as this none the less did many of us
feel it Then the foreman looking slowly round the table said Well
gentlemen I think we are all agreed to throw out this bill and all
except the painter the Jew and one other murmured Yes And as
though in throwing out this bill we had cast some trouble off our minds
we went on with the greater speed bringing in true bills About two
oclock we finished and trooped down to the Court to be released On
the stairway the Jew came close and having examined me a little sharply
with his velvety slits of eyes as if to see that he was not making a
mistake said Ith fonnywe bring in eighty thix bills true and one we
throw out and the one we throw out we know it to be true and the
dirtieth job of the whole lot Ith fonny Yes I answered him our
sense of respectability does seem excessive But just then we reached
the Court where in his red robe and grey wig with his clearcut
handsome face the judge seemed to shine and radiate like sun through
gloom I thank you gentlemen he said in a voice courteous and a
little mocking as though he had somewhere seen us before I thank you
for the way in which you have performed your duties I have not the
pleasure of assigning to you anything for your services except the
privilege of going over a prison where you will be able to see what sort
of existence awaits many of those to whose cases you have devoted so much
of your valuable time You are released gentlemen

Looking at each other a little hurriedly and not taking too much
farewell for fear of having to meet again we separated

I was then freefree of the injunction of that piece of paper reposing
in my pocket Yet its influence was still upon me I did not hurry
away but lingered in the courts fascinated by the notion that the fate
of each prisoner had first passed through my hands At last I made an
effort and went out into the corridor There I passed a woman whose
figure seemed familiar She was sitting with her hands in her lap
looking straight before her palefaced and not uncomely with thickish
mouth and nosethe woman whose bill we had thrown out Why was she
sitting there Had she not then realised that we had quashed her claim
or was she like myself kept here by mere attraction of the Law
Following I know not what impulse I said Your case was dismissed
wasnt it She looked up at me stolidly and a tear which had
evidently been long gathering dropped at the movement I do nod know
I waid to see she said in her thick voice I tink there has been
mistake My face no doubt betrayed something of my sentiments about
her case for the thick tears began rolling fast down her pasty cheeks
and her pentup feeling suddenly flowed forth in words I work ard
Gott how I work hard And there gomes dis liddle beastly man and rob
me And they say Ah yes but you are a bad woman we don trust
youyou speak lie But I speak druth I am nod a bad womanI gome
from Hamburg Yes yes I murmured yes yes I do not know this
country well sir I speak bad English Is that why they do not drust
my word She was silent for a moment searching my face then broke out
again It is all ard work in my profession I make very liddle I
cannot afford to be rob Without the men I cannod make my living I must
drust themand they rob me like this it is too ard And the slow
tears rolled faster and faster from her eyes on to her hands and her
black lap Then quietly and looking for a moment singularly like a big
unhappy child she asked Will you blease dell me sir why they will
not give me the law of that dirty little man

I knewand too well but I could not tell her

You see I said its just a case of your word against his Oh no
but she said eagerly he give me the noteI would not have taken it
if I ad not thought it good would I That is sure isnt it But five
pounds it is not my price It must that I give im change Those
gentlemen that heard my case they are men of business they must know
that it is not my price If I could tell the judgeI think he is a man
of business too he would know that too for sure I am not so young I
am not so veree beautiful as all that he must see mustnt he sir

At my wits end how to answer that most strange question I stammered
out But you know your profession is outside the law

At that a slow anger dyed her face She looked down then suddenly
lifting one of her dirty ungloved hands she laid it on her breast with
the gesture of one baring to me the truth in her heart I am not a bad
woman she said Dat beastly little man he do the same as meI am
freewoman I am not a slave bound to do the same tomorrow night no
more than he Such like him make me what I am he have all the pleasure
I have all the work He give me nodinghe rob my poor money and he
make me seem to strangers a bad woman Oh dear I am not happy

The impulse I had been having to press on her the money died within me
I felt suddenly it would be another insult From the movement of her
fingers about her heart I could not but see that this grief of hers was
not about the money It was the inarticulate outburst of a bitter sense
of deep injustice of all the dumb wondering at her own fate that went
about with her behind that broad stolid face and bosom This loss of the
money was but a symbol of the furtive hopeless insecurity she lived with
day and night now forced into the light for herself and all the world
to see She felt it suddenly a bitter unfair thing This beastly
little man did not share her insecurity None of us shared itnone of
us who had brought her down to this And quite unable to explain to
her how natural and proper it all was I only murmured I am sorry
awfully sorry and fled away


PANEL II

It was just a week later when having for passport my Grand Jury summons
I presented myself at that prison where we had the privilege of seeing
the existence to which we had assisted so many of the eightysix

Im afraid I said to the guardian of the gate that I am rather late
in availing myselfthe others no doubt

Not at all sir he said smiling Youre the first and if youll
excuse me I think youll be the last Will you wait in here while I
send for the chief warder to take you over

He showed me then to what he called the Warders Libraryan ironbarred
room more bare and brown than any I had seen since I left school While
I stood there waiting and staring out into the prison courtyard there
came rolling and rumbling in a Black Maria It drew up with a clatter
and I saw through the barred door the single prisonera young girl of
perhaps eighteendressed in rusty black She was resting her forehead
against a bar and looking out her quick narrow dark eyes taking in her
new surroundings with a sort of sharp restless indifference and her
pale thinupped oval face quite expressionless Behind those bars she
seemed to me for all the world like a little animal of the cat tribe
being brought in to her Zoo Me she did not see but if she had I felt
she would not shrinkonly give me the same sharp indifferent look she
was giving all else The policeman on the step behind had disappeared at
once and the driver now got down from his perch and coming round began
to gossip with her I saw her slink her eyes and smile at him and he
smiled back a large man not unkindly Then he returned to his horses
and she stayed as before with her forehead against the bars just
staring out Watching her like that unseen I seemed to be able to see
right through that tightlipped lynxeyed mask I seemed to know that
little creature through and through as one knows anything that one
surprises off its guard sunk in its most private moods I seemed to see
her little restless furtive utterly unmoral soul so stripped of all
defence as if she had taken it from her heart and handed it out to me
I saw that she was one of those whose hands slip as indifferently into
others pockets as into their own incapable of fidelity and incapable
of trusting quick as cats and as devoid of application ready to
scratch ready to purr ready to scratch again quick to change and
secretly as unchangeable as a little pebble And I thought Here we
are taking her to the Zoo by no means for the first time if demeanour
be any guide and we shall put her in a cage and make her sew and give
her good books which she will not read and she will sew and walk up and
down until we let her out then she will return to her old haunts and
at once go prowling and do exactly the same again what ever it was
until we catch her and lock her up once more And in this way we shall
go on purifying Society until she dies And I thought If indeed she had
been created cat in body as well as in soul we should not have treated
her thus but should have said Go on little cat you scratch us
sometimes you steal often you are as sensual as the night All this we
cannot help It is your nature So were you madewe know you cannot
changeyou amuse us Go on little cat Would it not then be better
and less savoury of humbug if we said the same to her whose catsoul has
chanced into this human shape For assuredly she will but pilfer and
scratch a little and be mildly vicious in her little life and do no
desperate harm having but poor capacity for evil behind that petty
thinupped mask What is the good of all this padlock business for such
as she are we not making mountains out of her mole hills Where is our
sense of proportion and our sense of humour Why try to alter the make
and shape of Nature with our petty chisels Or if we must take care of
her to save ourselves in the name of Heaven let us do it in a better
way than this And suddenly I remembered that I was a Grand Juryman a
purifier of Society who had brought her bill in true and that I might
not think these thoughts unworthy of a good citizen I turned my eyes
away from her and took up my list of indictments Yes there she was at
least so I decided Number 42 Pilson Jenny Larceny pocketpicking
And I turned my memory back to the evidence about her case but I could
not remember a single word In the margin I had noted Incorrigible
from a child up bad surroundings And a mad impulse came over me to go
back to my window and call through the bars to her Jenny Pilson Jenny
Pilson It was I who bred you and surrounded you with evil It was I
who caught you for being what I made you I brought your bill in true
I judged you and I caged you Jenny Pilson Jenny Pilson But just as
I reached the window the door of my waitingroom was fortunately opened
and a voice said Now sir at your service

I sat again in that scoop of the shore by the long rolling seas burying
in the sand the piece of paper which had summoned me away to my Grand
Jury and the same thoughts came to me with the breaking of the waves
that had come to me before How in every wave was a particle that had
known the shore of every land and in each sparkle of the hot sunlight
stealing up that bright water into the sky the microcosm of all change
and of all unity

GONE

Not possible to conceive of rarer beauty than that which clung about the
summer day three years ago when first we had the news of the poor Herds
Loveliness was a net of golden filaments in which the world was caught
It was gravity itself so tranquil and it was a sort of intoxicating
laughter From the top field that we crossed to go down to their
cottage all the far sweep of those outstretched wings of beauty could be
seen Very wonderful was the poise of the sacred bird that moved
nowhere but in our hearts The limetree scent was just stealing out
into air for some days already bereft of the scent of hay and the sun
was falling to his evening home behind our pines and beeches It was no
more than radiant warm And as we went we wondered why we had not been
told before that Mrs Herd was so very ill It was foolish to
wonderthese people do not speak of suffering till it is late To
speak when it means what this meant loss of wife and motherwas to
flatter reality too much To be healthy ordie That is their creed
To go on till they dropthen very soon pass away What room for states
betweenon their poor wage in their poor cottages

We crossed the millstream in the hollowto their white thatched
dwelling silent already awed almost resentful of this sovarying
Scheme of Things At the gateway Herd himself was standing just in from
his work For work in the country does not wait on illnesseven death
claims from its onlookers but a few hours birth none at all and it is
as well for what must be must and in work alone man rests from grief
Sorrow and anxiety had made strange alteration already in Herds face
Through every crevice of the rough stolid mask the spirit was peeping a
sort of quivering suppliant that seemed to ask all the time Is it
true A regular cottagers figure this of Herdsa labourer of these
partsstrong slow but active with just a touch of the untamed
somewhere about the swing and carriage of him about the strong jaw and
wide thicklipped mouth just that something independent which in great
variety clings to the natives of these still remote halfpagan valleys
by the moor

We all moved silently to the lee of the outer wall so that our voices
might not carry up to the sick woman lying there under the eaves almost
within hand reach Yes sir No sir Yes maam This and the
constant unforgettable supplication of his eyes was all that came from
him yet he seemed loath to let us go as though he thought we had some
mysterious power to help himthe magic perhaps of money to those who
have none Grateful at our promise of another doctor a specialist he
yet seemed with his eyes to say that he knew that such were only
embroideries of Fate And when we had wrung his hand and gone we heard
him coming after us His wife had said she would like to see us please
Would we come up

An old woman and Mrs Herds sister were in the sittingroom they showed
us to the crazy narrow stairway Though we lived distant but four
hundred yards of a crows flight we had never seen Mrs Herd before for
that is the way of things in this land of minding ones own businessa
slight dark girlishlooking woman almost quite refined away and with
those eyes of the dying where the spirit is coming through as it only
does when it knows that all is over except just the passing She lay in
a double bed with clean white sheets A whitewashed room so low that
the ceiling almost touched our heads some flowers in a bowl the small
lattice window open Though it was hot in there it was better far than
the rooms of most families in towns living on a wage of twice as much
for here was no sign of defeat in decency or cleanliness In her face
as in poor Herds was that same strange mingling of resigned despair and
almost eager appeal so terrible to disappoint Yet trying not to
disappoint it one felt guilty of treachery What was the good the
kindness in making this poor bird flutter still with hope against the
bars when fast prison had so surely closed in round her But what else
could we do We could not give her those glib assurances that naive
souls make so easily to others concerning their after state

Secretly I think we knew that her philosophy of calm reality that
queer and unbidden growing tranquillity which precedes death was nearer
to our own belief than would be any giltedged orthodoxy but
nevertheless such is the strength of what is expected we felt it
dreadful that we could not console her with the ordinary presumptions

You mustnt give up hope we kept on saying The new doctor will do a
lot for you hes a specialista very clever man

And she kept on answering Yes sir Yes maam But still her eyes
went on asking as if there were something else she wanted And then to
one of us came an inspiration

You mustnt let your husband worry about expense That will be all
right

She smiled then as if the chief cloud on her soul had been the thought
of the arrears her illness and death would leave weighing on him with
whom she had shared this bed ten years and more And with that smile
warming the memory of those spirithaunted eyes we crept downstairs
again and out into the fields

It was more beautiful than ever just touched already with evening
mysteryit was better than ever to be alive And the immortal wonder
that has haunted man since first he became man and haunts I think even
the animalsthe unanswerable questionwhy joy and beauty must ever be
walking hand in hand with ugliness and pain haunted us across those
fields of life and loveliness It was all right no doubt even
reasonable since without dark there is no light It was part of that
unending sum whose answer is not given the merest little swing of the
great pendulum And yet To accept this violent contrast without a
sigh of revolt without a question No sirs it was not so jolly as all
that That she should be dying there at thirty of a creeping malady
which she might have checked perhaps if she had not had too many things
to do for the children and husband to do anything for herselfif she
had not been forced to hold the creed Be healthy or die This was no
doubt perfectly explicable and in accordance with the Supreme Equation
yet we enjoying life and health and ease of money felt horror and
revolt on this evening of such beauty Nor at the moment did we derive
great comfort from the thought that life slips in and out of sheath like
sunsparks on water and that of all the cloud of summer midges dancing
in the last gleam not one would be alive tomorrow

It was three evenings later that we heard uncertain footfalls on the
flagstones of the verandah then a sort of brushing sound against the
wood of the long open window Drawing aside the curtain one of us
looked out Herd was standing there in the bright moonlight bareheaded
with roughened hair He came in and seeming not to know quite where he
went took stand by the hearth and putting up his dark hand gripped the
mantelshelf Then as if recollecting himself he said Gude evenin
sir beg pardon Mm No more for a full minute but his hand taking
some little china thing turned it over and over without ceasing and
down his broken face tears ran Then very suddenly he said Shes
gone And his hand turned over and over that little china thing and
the tears went on rolling down Then stumbling and swaying like a man
in drink he made his way out again into the moonlight We watched him
across the lawn and path and through the gate till his footfalls died
out there in the field and his figure was lost in the black shadow of
the holly hedge

And the night was so beautiful so utterly glamourously beautiful with
its starflowers and its silence and its trees clothed in moonlight
All was tranquil as a dream of sleep But it was long before our hearts
wandering with poor Herd would let us remember that she had slipped away
into so beautiful a dream

The dead do not suffer from their rest in beauty But the living

THRESHING

When the drone of the thresher breaks through the autumn sighing of trees
and wind or through that stillness of the first frost I get restless
and more restless till throwing down my pen I have gone out to see
For there is nothing like the sight of threshing for making one feel
goodnot in the sense of comfort but at heart There under the pines
and the already leafless elms and beechtrees close to the great stacks
is the big busy creature with its small black puffing engine astern
and there all around it is that conglomeration of unsentimental labour
which invests all the crises of farm work with such fascination The
crew of the farm is only five all told but today they are fifteen and
none strangers save the owners of the travelling thresher

They are working without respite and with little speech not at all as if
they had been brought together for the benefit of some one elses corn
but as though they one and all had a private grudge against Time and a
personal pleasure in finishing this job which while it lasts is
bringing them extra pay and most excellent free feeding Just as after a
dilatory voyage a crew will brace themselves for the run in recording
with sudden energy their consciousness of triumph over the elements so
on a farm the harvests of hay and corn sheepshearing and threshing
will bring out in all a common sentiment a kind of sporting energy a
defiant spurt as it were to score off Nature for it is only a
philosopher here and there among them I think who sees that Nature is
eager to be scored off in this fashion being anxious that some one
should eat her kindly fruits

With ceremonial as grave as that which is at work within the thresher
itself the tasks have been divided At the root of all things
pitchforking from the stack standsthe farmer moustached and always
upright was he not in the Yeomanrydignified in a hard black hat no
waistcoat and his working coat so ragged that it would never cling to
him but for pure affection Between him and the body of the machine are
five more pitch forks directing the pale flood of raw material There
amongst them is poor Herd still so sad from his summer loss plodding
doggedly away To watch him even now makes one feel how terrible is that
dumb grief which has never learned to moan And there is George Yeoford
almost too sober and Murdon plying his pitchfork with a supernatural
regularity that cannot quite dim his queer brigands face of dark soft
gloom shot with sudden humours his soft dark corduroys and battered
hat Occasionally he stops and taking off that hat wipes his
corrugated brow under black hair and seems to brood over his own
regularity

Down here too where I stand each separate function of the thresher has
its appointed slave Here Cedric rakes the chaff pouring from the side
down into the chaffshed Carting the straw that streams from the
thresher bows are Michelmore and Neckthe little man who cannot read
but can milk and whistle the hearts out of his cows till they follow him
like dogs At the threshers stern is Morris the driver selected
because of that utter reliability which radiates from his broad handsome
face His part is to attend the sacking of the three kinds of grain for
ever sieving out He murmurs Busy work sir and opens a little door
to show me how the machinery does it all holding a sack between his
knees and some string in his white teeth Then away goes the sackfour
bushels one hundred and sixty pounds of genuines seconds or
seedwheeled by Cedric on a little trolley thing to where
GeorgetheGaul or JimtheEarlySaxon is waiting to bear it on his back
up the stone steps into the cornchamber

It has been raining in the night the ground is a churn of straw and mud
and the trees still drip but now there is sunlight a sweet air and
clear sky winecoloured through the red naked beechtwigs tipped with
white untimely buds Nothing can be more lovely than this late autumn
day so still save for the droning of the thresher and the constant
tinny chuckle of the grey thinheaded Guineafowl driven by this
business away from their usual haunts

And soon the feeling that I knew would come begins creeping over me the
sense of an extraordinary sanity in this neverceasing harmonious labour
pursued in the autumn air faintly perfumed with woodsmoke with the
scent of chaff and whiffs from that black puffingBilly the sense that
there is nothing between this clean toilnot too hard but hard
enoughand the clean consumption of its clean results the sense that
nobody except myself is in the least conscious of how sane it all is
The brains of these sane ones are all too busy with the real affairs of
life the disposition of their wages anticipation of dinner some girl
some junketing some wager the last rifle match and more than all
with that pleasant rhythmic nothingness companion of the busy swing and
play of muscles which of all states is secretly most akin to the deep
unconsciousness of life itself Thus to work in the free air for the good
of all and the hurt of none without worry or the breath of
acrimonysurely no phase of human life so nears the life of the truly
civilised communitythe life of a hive of bees Not one of these
working so sanelyunless it be Morris who will spend his Sunday
afternoon on some high rock just watching sunlight and shadow drifting on
the moorsnot one I think is distraught by perception of his own
sanity by knowledge of how near he is to Harmony not even by
appreciation of the still radiance of this day or its innumerable fine
shades of colour It is all work and no moody consciousnessall work
and will end in sleep

I leave them soon and make my way up the stone steps to the corn
chamber where tranquillity is crowned In the whitewashed room the
corn lies in drifts and ridges three to four feet deep all silverydun
like some remote sand desert lifeless beneath the moon Here it lies
and into it staggering under the sacks GeorgetheGaul and
JimtheEarly Saxon tramp up to their knees spill the sacks over their
heads and out again and above where their feet have plunged the patient
surface closes again smooth And as I stand there in the doorway
looking at that silvery corn drift I think of the whole process from
seed sown to the last sieving into this tranquil restingplace I think
of the slow dogged ploughman with the crows above him on the wind of
the swing of the sowers arm dark up against grey sky on the steep
field I think of the seed snugburrowing for safety and its mysterious
ferment under the warm Spring rain of the soft green shoots tapering up
so shyly toward the first sun and hardening in air to thin wiry stalk
I think of the unnumerable tiny beasts that have jangled in that pale
forest of the winged blue jewels of butterfly risen from it to hover on
the wildrustling blades of that continual music played there by the
wind of the chicory and poppy flowers that have been its lightso love
as it grew tawny and full of life before the appointed date when it
should return to its captivity I think of that slowtravelling hum and
swish which laid it low of the gathering to stack and the long waiting
under the rustle and drip of the sheltering trees until yesterday the
hoot of the thresher blew and there began the falling into this dun
silvery peace Here it will lie with the pale sun narrowly filtering in
on it and by night the pale moon till slowly week by week it is
stolen away and its ridges and drifts sink and sink and the beasts have
eaten it all

When the dusk is falling I go out to them again They have nearly
finished now the chaff in the chaffshed is mounting hillockhigh only
the little barley stack remains unthreshed Mrs GeorgetheGaul is
standing with a jug to give drink to the tired ones Some stars are
already netted in the branches of the pines the Guineafowl are silent
But still the harmonious thresher hums and showers from three sides the
straw the chaff the corn and the men fork and rake and cart and
carry sleep growing in their muscles silence on their tongues and the
tranquillity of the long day nearly ended in their souls They will go
on till it is quite dark

THAT OLDTIME PLACE

Yes suhhere we are at that oldtime place And our dark driver drew
up his little victoria gently

Through the open doorway into a dim cavernous ruined house of New
Orleans we passed The mildew and dirt the dark denuded dankness of
that old hostel rotting down with damp and time

And our guide the tall thin greyhaired dame who came forward with
such native ease and moved before us touching this fungused wall that
rusting stairway and telling as it were no one in her soft slow
speech things that any one could seewhat a strange and fitting figure

Before the smell of the deserted oozing rooms before that old creature
leading us on and on negligent of all our questions and talking to the
air as though we were not we felt such discomfort that we soon made to
go out again into such freshness as there was on that day of dismal heat
Then realising it seemed that she was losing us our old guide turned
for the first time looking in our faces she smiled and said in her
sweet weak voice like the sound from the strings of a spinet long
unplayed on Don you wahnd to see the domeroom an all the other
rooms right here of this oldtime place

Again those words We had not the hearts to disappoint her And as we
followed on and on along the mouldering corridors and rooms where the
black peeling papers hung like stalactites the dominance of our senses
gradually dropped from us and with our souls we saw its soulthe soul
of this oldtime place this mustering house of the old South bereft of
all but ghosts and the grey pigeons niched in the rotting gallery round a
narrow courtyard open to the sky

This is the domeroom suh and lady right over the slavemarket it is
Here they did the business of the Statesure oldtime heroes up therein
the roofWashington Hamilton Jefferson Davis Leethere they are
All gonenow Yes suh

A fineyea even a splendid room of great height and carved grandeur
with handwrought bronze sconces and a band of metal bordering all
blackened with oblivion And the faces of those old heroes encircling
that domed ceiling were blackened too and scarred with damp beyond
recognition Here beneath their gaze men had banqueted and danced and
ruled The pride and might and vivid strength of things still fluttered
their uneasy flags of spirit moved disherited wings Those oldtime
feasts and grave discussionswe seemed to see them printed on the thick
air imprisoned in this great chamber built above their dark foundations
The pride and the might and the vivid strength of thingsgone all gone

We became conscious again of that soft weak voice

Not hearing very well suh I have it all printed ladybeautifully
told hereyes indeed

She was putting cards into our hands then impassive maintaining ever
her impersonal chant the guardian of past glory led us on

Now we shall see the slavemarketdownstairs underneath Its wet for
the lady the water comes in now yes suh

On the crumbling black and white marble floorings the water indeed was
trickling into pools And down in the halls there came to us
wanderingstrangest thing that ever strayed through deserted grandeura
brown broken horse lean with a sore flank and a head of tremendous
age It stopped and gazed at us as though we might be going to give it
things to eat then passed on stumbling over the ruined marbles For a
moment we had thought him ghostone of the many But he was not since
his hoofs sounded The scrambling clatter of them had died out into
silence before we came to that dark cryptlike chamber whose marble
columns were ringed in iron veritable pillars of foundation And then
we saw that our old guides hands were full of newspapers She struck a
match they caught fire and blazed Holding high that torch she said
See Up theres his name above where he stood The auctioneer Oh
yes indeed Heres where they sold them

Below that name decaying on the wall we had the slow uncanny feeling
of some one standing there in the gleam and flicker from that paper
torch For a moment the whole shadowy room seemed full of forms and
faces Then the torch lied out and our old guide pointing through an
archway with the blackened stump of it said

Twas here they kept them indeed yes

We saw before us a sort of vault stonebuilt and low and long The
light there was too dim for us to make out anything but walls and heaps
of rusting scrapiron cast away there and mouldering own But trying to
pierce that darkness we became conscious as it seemed of innumerable
eyes gazing not at us but through the archway where we stood
innumerable white eyeballs gleaming out of blackness From behind us
came a little laugh It floated past through the archway toward those
eyes Who was that Who laughed in there The old South itselfthat
incredible fine lost soul That oldtime thing of old ideals
blindfolded by its own history That queer proud blend of simple
chivalry and tyranny of piety and the abhorrent thing Who was it
laughed there in the old slavemarketlaughed at these white eyeballs
glaring from out of the blackness of their dark cattlepen What poor
departed soul in this House of Melancholy But there was no ghost when
we turned to lookonly our old guide with her sweet smile

Yes suh Here they all cametwas the finest hotelbefore the
wartime old Southern familiesbuyin an sellin their property Yes
maam very interesting This way And here were the bells to all the
rooms Broken you seeall broken

And rather quickly we passed away out of that oldtime place where
something had laughed and the drip drip drip of water down the walls
was as the sound of a spirit grieving

ROMANCETHREE GLEAMS

On that New Years morning when I drew up the blind it was still nearly
dark but for the faintest pink flush glancing out there on the horizon
of black water The far shore of the rivers mouth was just soft dusk
and the dim trees below me were in perfect stillness There was no lap of
water And thenI saw her drifting in on the tidethe little ship
passaging below me a happy ghost Like no thing of this world she came
ending her flight with sailwings closing and her glowing lantern eyes
There was I know not what of stealthy joy about her thus creeping in to
the unexpecting land And I wished she would never pass but go on
gliding by down there for ever with her dark ropes and her bright
lanterns and her mysterious felicity so that I might have for ever in
my heart the blessed feeling she brought me coming like this out of that
great mystery the sea If only she need not change to solidity but ever
be this visitor from the unknown this sacred bird telling with her
halfseen trailingdown plumesails the story of uncharted wonder If
only I might go on trembling as I was with the rapture of all I did not
know and could not see yet felt pressing against me and touching my face
with its lips To think of her at anchor in cold light was like
flingingto a door in the face of happiness And just then she struck
her bell the faint silvery fardown sound fled away before her and to
every side out into the utter hush to discover echo But nothing
answered as if fearing to break the spell of her coming to brush with
reality the dark sea dew from her sailwings But within me in
response there began the song of all unknown things the song so
tenuous so ecstatic that seems to sweep and quiver across such thin
golden strings and like an eager dream dies too soon The song of the
secretknowing wind that has peered through so great forests and over
such wild sea blown on so many faces and in the jungles of the grass
the song of all that the wind has seen and felt The song of lives that
I should never live of the loves that I should never love singlng to me
as though I should And suddenly I felt that I could not bear my little
ship of dreams to grow hard and grey her bright lanterns drowned in the
cold light her dark ropes spidery and taut her seawan sails all
furled and she no more en chanted and turning away I let fall the
curtain


II

Then what happens to the moon She who shy and veiled slips out
before dusk to take the air of heaven wandering timidly among the
columned clouds and fugitive from the staring of the sun she who when
dusk has come rules the sentient night with such chaste and icy
spellwhither and how does she retreat

I came on her one morningI surprised her She was stealing into a dark
wintry wood and five little stars were chasing her She was
orangehooded a lightolove dismissedunashamed and unfatigued
having takenall And she was looking back with her almond eyes across
her darkivory shoulder at Night where he still lay drowned in the sleep
she had brought him What a strange slow mocking look So might
Aphrodite herself have looked back at some weary lover remembering the
fire of his first embrace Insatiate smiling creature slipping down to
the rim of the world to her bath in the sweet waters of dawn whence
emerging pure as a water lily she would float in the cool sky till
evening came again And just then she saw me looking and hid behind a
holmoak tree but I could still see the gleam of one shoulder and her
long narrow eyes pursuing me I went up to the tree and parted its dark
boughs to take her but she had slipped behind another I called to her
to stand if only for one moment But she smiled and went slip ping on
and I ran thrusting through the wet bushes leaping the fallen trunks
The scent of rotting leaves disturbed by my feet leaped out into the
darkness and birds surprised fluttered away And still I ranshe
slipping ever further into the grove and ever looking back at me And I
thought But I will catch you yet you nymph of perdition The wood will
soon be passed you will have no cover then And from her eyes and the
scanty gleam of her flying limbs I never looked away not even when I
stumbled or ran against tree trunks in my blind haste And at every
clearing I flew more furiously thinking to seize all of her with my gaze
before she could cross the glade but ever she found some little low
tree some bush of birch ungrown or the far top branches of the next
grove to screen her flying body and preserve allurement And all the
time she was dipping dipping to the rim of the world And then I
tripped but as I rose I saw that she had lingered for me her long
sliding eyes were full it seemed to me of pity as if she would have
liked for me to have enjoyed the sight of her I stood still
breathless thinking that at last she would consent but flinging back
up into the air one darkivory arm she sighed and vanished And the
breath of her sigh stirred all the birchtree twigs just coloured with
the dawn Long I stood in that thicket gazing at the spot where she had
leapt from me over the edge of the worldmy heart quivering
 

III

We embarked on the estuary steamer that winter morning just as daylight
came full The sun was on the wing scattering little white clouds as an
eagle might scatter doves They scurried up before him with their broken
feathers tipped and tinged with gold In the air was a touch of frost
and a smoky mistdrift clung here and there above the reeds blurring the
shores of the lagoon so that we seemed to be steaming across boundless
water till some clump of trees would fling its top out of the fog then
fall back into whiteness

And then in that thick vapour rounding I suppose some curve we came
suddenly into we knew not whatall white and moving it was as if the
mist were crazed murmuring too with a sort of restless beating We
seemed to be passing through a ghostthe ghost of all the life that had
sprung from this water and its shores we seemed to have left reality
to be travelling through live wonder

And the fantastic thought sprang into my mind I have died This is the
voyage of my soul in the wild I am in the final wilderness of
spiritslost in the ghost robe that wraps the earth There seemed in
all this white murmuration to be millions of tiny hands stretching out to
me millions of whispering voices of wistful eyes I had no fear but a
curious baked eagerness the strangest feeling of having lost myself and
become part of this around me exactly as if my own hands and voice and
eyes had left me and were groping and whispering and gazing out there
in the eeriness I was no longer a man on an estuary steamer but part
of sentient ghostliness Nor did I feel unhappy it seemed as though I
had never been anything but this Bedouin spirit wandering

We passed through again into the stillness of plain mist and all those
eerie sensations went leaving nothing but curiosity to know what this
was that we had traversed Then suddenly the sun came flaring out and
we saw behind us thousands and thousands of white gulls dipping
wheeling brushing the water with their wings bewitched with sun and
mist That was all And yet that whitewinged legion through whom we
had ploughed our way were not could never be to me just gullsthere
was more than mere sunglamour gilding their misty plumes there was the
wizardry of my past wonder the enchantment of romance

MEMORIES

We set out to meet him at Waterloo Station on a dull day of FebruaryI
who had owned his impetuous mother knowing a little what to expect
while to my companion he would be all original We stood there waiting
for the Salisbury train was late and wondering with a warm
halffearful eagerness what sort of new thread Life was going to twine
into our skein I think our chief dread was that he might have light
eyesthose yellow Chinese eyes of the common particoloured spaniel
And each new minute of the trains tardiness increased our anxious
compassion His first journey his first separation from his mother this
black twomonths baby Then the train ran in and we hastened to look
for him Have you a dog for us

A dog Not in this van Ask the rearguard

Have you a dog for us

Thats right From Salisbury Heres your wild beast Sir

From behind a wooden crate we saw a long black muzzled nose poking round
at us and heard a faint hoarse whimpering

I remember my first thought

Isnt his nose too long

But to my companions heart it went at once because it was swollen from
crying and being pressed against things that he could not see through
We took him outsoft wobbly tearful set him down on his four as yet
not quite simultaneous legs and regarded him Or rather my companion
did having her head on one side and a quavering smile and I regarded
her knowing that I should thereby get a truer impression of him

He wandered a little round our legs neither wagging his tail nor licking
at our hands then he looked up and my companion said Hes an angel

I was not so certain He seemed hammerheaded with no eyes at all and
little connection between his head his body and his legs His ears
were very long as long as his poor nose and gleaming down in the
blackness of him I could see the same white star that disgraced his
mothers chest

Picking him up we carried him to a fourwheeled cab and took his muzzle
off His little darkbrown eyes were resolutely fixed on distance and
by his refusal to even smell the biscuits we had brought to make him
happy we knew that the human being had not yet come into a life that had
contained so far only a mother a woodshed and four other soft wobbly
black hammerheaded angels smelling of themselves and warmth and wood
shavings It was pleasant to feel that to us he would surrender an
untouched love that is if he would surrender anything Suppose he did
not take to us

And just then something must have stirred in him for he turned up his
swollen nose and stared at my companion and a little later rubbed the
dry pinkness of his tongue against my thumb In that look and that
unconscious restless lick he was trying hard to leave unhappiness
behind trying hard to feel that these new creatures with stroking paws
and queer scents were his mother yet all the time he knew I am sure
that they were something bigger more permanently desperately his The
first sense of being owned perhaps who knows of owning had stirred in
him He would never again be quite the same unconscious creature

A little way from the end of our journey we got out and dismissed the
cab He could not too soon know the scents and pavements of this London
where the chief of his life must pass I can see now his first bumble
down that wide backwater of a street how continually and suddenly he
sat down to make sure of his own legs how continually he lost our heels
He showed us then in full perfection what was afterwards to be an
inconvenientif endearingcharacteristic At any call or whistle he
would look in precisely the opposite direction How many times all
through his life have I not seen him at my whistle start violently and
turn his tail to me then with nose thrown searchingly from side to
side begin to canter toward the horizon

In that first walk we met fortunately but one vehicle a brewers
dray he chose that moment to attend to the more serious affairs of life
sitting quietly before the horses feet and requiring to be moved by
hand From the beginning he had his dignity and was extremely difficult
to lift owing to the length of his middle distance

What strange feelings must have stirred in his little white soul when he
first smelled carpet But it was all so strange to him that dayI
doubt if he felt more than I did when I first travelled to my private
school reading Tales of a Grandfather and plied with tracts and
sherry by my fathers man of business

That night indeed for several nights he slept with me keeping me too
warm down my back and waking me now and then with quaint sleepy
whimperings Indeed all through his life he flew a good deal in his
sleep fighting dogs and seeing ghosts running after rabbits and thrown
sticks and to the last one never quite knew whether or no to rouse him
when his four black feet began to jerk and quiver His dreams were like
our dreams both good and bad happy sometimes sometimes tragic to
weeping point

He ceased to sleep with me the day we discovered that he was a perfect
little colony whose settlers were of an active species which I have
never seen again After that he had many beds for circumstance ordained
that his life should be nomadic and it is to this I trace that
philosophic indifference to place or property which marked him out from
most of his own kind He learned early that for a black dog with long
silky ears a feathered tail and head of great dignity there was no
home whatsoever away from those creatures with special scents who took
liberties with his name and alone of all created things were privileged
to smack him with a slipper He would sleep anywhere so long as it was
in their room or so close outside it as to make no matter for it was
with him a principle that what he did not smell did not exist I would I
could hear again those long rubberlipped snufflings of recognition
underneath the door with which each morning he would regale and reassure
a spirit that grew with age more and more nervous and delicate about this
matter of propinquity For he was a dog of fixed ideas things stamped
on his mind were indelible as for example his duty toward cats for
whom he had really a perverse affection which had led to that first
disastrous moment of his life when he was brought up poor bewildered
puppy from a brief excursion to the kitchen with one eye closed and his
cheek torn He bore to his grave that jagged scratch across the eye It
was in dread of a repetition of this tragedy that he was instructed at
the word Cats to rush forward with a special towrowrowing which he
never used toward any other form of creature To the end he cherished a
hope that he would reach the cat but never did and if he had we knew
he would only have stood and wagged his tail but I well remember once
when he returned important from some such sally how dreadfully my
companion startled a catloving friend by murmuring in her most honeyed
voice Well my darling have you been killing pussies in the garden

His eye and nose were impeccable in their sense of form indeed he was
very English in that matter People must be just so things smell
properly and affairs go on in the one right way He could tolerate
neither creatures in ragged clothes nor children on their hands and
knees nor postmen because with their bags they swelledup on one
side and carried lanterns on their stomachs He would never let the
harmless creatures pass without religious barks Naturally a believer in
authority and routine and distrusting spiritual adventure he yet had
curious fads that seemed to have nested in him quite outside of all
principle He would for instance follow neither carriages nor horses
and if we tried to make him at once left for home where he would sit
with nose raised to Heaven emitting through it a most lugubrious shrill
noise Then again one must not place a stick a slipper a glove or
anything with which he could play upon ones headsince such an action
reduced him at once to frenzy For so conservative a dog his
environment was sadly anarchistic He never complained in words of our
shifting habits but curled his head round over his left paw and pressed
his chin very hard against the ground whenever he smelled packing What
necessity he seemed continually to be saying what real necessity is
there for change of any kind whatever Here we were all together and
one day was like another so that I knew where I wasand now you only
know what will happen next and II cant tell you whether I shall be
with you when it happens What strange grieving minutes a dog passes at
such times in the underground of his subconsciousness refusing
realisation yet all the time only too well divining Some careless
word some unmuted compassion in voice the stealthy wrapping of a pair
of boots the unaccustomed shutting of a door that ought to be open the
removal from a downstair room of an object always thereone tiny thing
and he knows for certain that he is not going too He fights against the
knowledge just as we do against what we cannot bear he gives up hope
but not effort protesting in the only way he knows of and now and then
heaving a great sigh Those sighs of a dog They go to the heart so much
more deeply than the sighs of our own kind because they are utterly
unintended regardless of effect emerging from one who heaving them
knows not that they have escaped him

The words Yesgoing too spoken in a certain tone would call up in
his eyes a stillquestioning halfhappiness and from his tail a quiet
flutter but did not quite serve to put to rest either his doubt or his
feeling that it was all unnecessaryuntil the cab arrived Then he
would pour himself out of door or window and be found in the bottom of
the vehicle looking severely away from an admiring cabman Once settled
on our feet he travelled with philosophy but no digestion

I think no dog was ever more indifferent to an outside world of human
creatures yet few dogs have made more conquestsespecially among
strange women through whom however he had a habit of lookingvery
discouraging He had natheless one or two particular friends such as
him to whom this book is dedicated and a few persons whom he knew he had
seen before but broadly speaking there were in his world of men only
his mistress andthe almighty

Each August till he was six he was sent for health and the assuagement
of his hereditary instincts up to a Scotch shooting where he carried
many birds in a very tender manner Once he was compelled by Fate to
remain there nearly a year and we went up ourselves to fetch him home
Down the long avenue toward the keepers cottage we walked It was high
autumn there had been frost already for the ground was fine with red
and yellow leaves and presently we saw himself coming professionally
questing among those leaves and preceding his dear keeper with the
businesslike selfcontainment of a sportsman not too fat glossy as a
ravens wing swinging his ears and sporran like a little Highlander We
approached him silently Suddenly his nose went up from its imagined
trail and he came rushing at our legs From him as a garment drops
from a man dropped all his strange soberness he became in a single
instant one fluttering eagerness He leaped from life to life in one
bound without hesitation without regret Not one sigh not one look
back not the faintest token of gratitude or regret at leaving those good
people who had tended him for a whole year buttered oatcake for him
allowed him to choose each night exactly where he would sleep No he
just marched out beside us as close as ever he could get drawing us on
in spirit and not even attending to the scents until the lodge gates
were passed

It was strictly in accordance with the perversity of things and
something in the nature of calamity that he had not been ours one year
when there came over me a dreadful but overmastering aversion from
killing those birds and creatures of which he was so fond as soon as they
were dead And so I never knew him as a sportsman for during that first
year he was only an unbroken puppy tied to my waist for fear of
accidents and carefully pulling me off every shot They tell me he
developed a lovely nose and perfect mouth large enough to hold gingerly
the biggest hare I well believe it remembering the qualities of his
mother whose character however in stability he far surpassed But as
he grew every year more devoted to dead grouse and birds and rabbits I
liked them more and more alive it was the only real breach between us
and we kept it out of sight Ah well it is consoling to reflect that I
should infallibly have ruined his sporting qualities lacking that
peculiar habit of meaning what one says so necessary to keep dogs
virtuous But surely to have had him with me quivering and alert with
his solemn eager face would have given a new joy to those crisp
mornings when the hope of wings coming to the gun makes poignant in the
sports man as nothing else will an almost sensual love of Nature a
fierce delight in the soft glow of leaves in the white birch stems and
tracery of sparse twigs against blue sky in the scents of sap and grass
and gum and heather flowers stivers the hair of him with keenness for
interpreting each sound and fills the very fern or moss he kneels on
the very trunk he leans against with strange vibration

Slowly Fate prepares for each of us the religion that lies coiled in our
most secret nerves with such we cannot trifle we do not even try But
how shall a man grudge any one sensations he has so keenly felt Let
such as have never known those curious delights uphold the hand of
horrorfor me there can be no such luxury If I could I would still
perhaps be knowing them but when once the joy of life in those winged
and furry things has knocked at the very portals of ones spirit the
thought that by pressing a little iron twig one will rive that joy out of
their vitals is too hard to bear Call it aestheticism squeamishness
nambypamby sentimentalism what you will it is stronger than oneself

Yes after one had once watched with an eye that did not merely see the
thirsty gaping of a slowly dying bird or a rabbit dragging a broken leg
to a hole where he would lie for hours thinking of the fern to which he
should never more come forthafter that there was always the following
little matter of arithmetic Given that all those who had been shooting
were goodfair shotswhich Heaven knew they never werethey yet
missed one at least in four and did not miss it very much so that if
seventyfive things were slain there were also twentyfive that had been
fired at and of those twentyfive twelve and a half had gotten it
somewhere in their bodies and would likely die at their great leisure

This was the sum that brought about the only cleavage in our lives and
so as he grew older and trying to part from each other we no longer
could he ceased going to Scotland But after that I often felt and
especially when we heard guns how the best and most secret instincts of
him were being stifled But what was to be done In that which was left
of a clay pigeon he would take not the faintest interestthe scent of it
was paltry Yet always even in his most cosseted and idle days he
managed to preserve the grave preoccupation of one professionally
concerned with retrieving things that smell and consoled himself with
pastimes such as cricket which he played in a manner highly specialised
following the ball up the moment it left the bowlers hand and sometimes
retrieving it before it reached the batsman When remonstrated with he
would consider a little hanging out a pink tongue and looking rather too
eagerly at the ball then canter slowly out to a sort of forward short
leg Why he always chose that particular position it is difficult to
say possibly he could lurk there better than anywhere else the
batsmans eye not being on him and the bowlers not too much As a
fieldsman he was perfect but for an occasional belief that he was not
merely short leg but slip point midoff and wicketkeep and perhaps a
tendency to make the ball a little jubey But he worked tremendously
watching every movement for he knew the game thoroughly and seldom
delayed it more than three minutes when he secured the ball And if that
ball were really lost then indeed he took over the proceedings with an
intensity and quiet vigour that destroyed many shrubs and the solemn
satisfaction which comes from being in the very centre of the stage

But his most passionate delight was swimming in anything except the sea
for which with its unpleasant noise and habit of tasting salt he had
little affection I see him now cleaving the Serpentine with his air
of the world well lost striving to reach my stick before it had
touched water Being only a large spaniel too small for mere heroism
he saved no lives in the water but his ownand that on one occasion
before our very eyes from a dark trout stream which was trying to wash
him down into a black hole among the boulders

The call of the wildSpring runningwhatever it isthat besets men and
dogs seldom attained full mastery over him but one could often see it
struggling against his devotion to the scent of us and watching that
dumb contest I have time and again wondered how far this civilisation of
ours was justifiably imposed on him how far the love for us that we had
so carefully implanted could ever replace in him the satisfaction of his
primitive wild yearnings He was like a man naturally polygamous
married to one loved woman

It was surely not for nothing that Rover is dogs most common name and
would be ours but for our too tenacious fear of losing something to
admit even to ourselves that we are hankering There was a man who
said Strange that two such queerly opposite qualities as courage and
hypocrisy are the leading characteristics of the AngloSaxon But is not
hypocrisy just a product of tenacity which is again the lower part of
courage Is not hypocrisy but an active sense of property in ones good
name the clutching close of respectability at any price the feeling
that one must not part even at the cost of truth with what he has
sweated so to gain And so we AngloSaxons will not answer to the name
of Rover and treat our dogs so that they too hardly know their
natures

The history of his one wandering for which no respectable reason can be
assigned will never of course be known It was in London of an
October evening when we were told he had slipped out and was not
anywhere Then began those four distressful hours of searching for that
black needle in that blacker bundle of hay Hours of real dismay and
suffering for it is suffering indeed to feel a loved thing swallowed up
in that hopeless haze of London streets Stolen or run over Which was
worst The neighbouring police stations visited the Dogs Home
notified an order of five hundred Lost Dog bills placed in the
printers hands the streets patrolled And then in a lull snatched for
food and still endeavouring to preserve some aspect of assurance we
heard the bark which meant Here is a door I cannot open We hurried
forth and there he was on the top doorstepbusy unashamed giving no
explanations asking for his supper and very shortly after him came his
five hundred Lost Dog bills Long I sat looking at him that night
after my companion had gone up thinking of the evening some years
before when there followed as that shadow of a spaniel who had been lost
for eleven days And my heart turned over within me But he He was
asleep for he knew not remorse

Ah and there was that other time when it was reported to me returning
home at night that he had gone out to find me and I went forth again
disturbed and whistling his special call to the empty fields Suddenly
out of the darkness I heard a rushing and he came furiously dashing
against my heels from he alone knew where he had been lurking and saying
to himself I will not go in till he comes I could not scold there was
something too lyrical in the return of that live lonely rushing piece
of blackness through the blacker night After all the vagary was but a
variation in his practice when one was away at bedtime of passionately
scratching up his bed in protest till it resembled nothing for in
spite of his long and solemn face and the silkiness of his ears there
was much in him yet of the cave bearhe dug graves on the smallest
provocations in which he never buried anything He was not a clever
dog and guiltless of all tricks Nor was he ever shown We did not
even dream of subjecting him to this indignity Was our dog a clown a
hobby a fad a fashion a feather in our caps that we should subject him
to periodic pennings in stuffy halls that we should harry his faithful
soul with such tomfoolery He never even heard us talk about his
lineage deplore the length of his nose or call him cleverlooking
We should have been ashamed to let him smell about us the tarbrush of a
sense of property to let him think we looked on him as an asset to earn
us pelf or glory We wished that there should be between us the spirit
that was between the sheep dog and that farmer who when asked his dogs
age touched the old creatures head and answered thus Teresa his
daughter was born in November and this one in August That sheep dog
had seen eighteen years when the great white day came for him and his
spirit passed away up to cling with the woodsmoke round the dark
rafters of the kitchen where he had lain so vast a time beside his
masters boots No no If a man does not soon pass beyond the thought
By what shall this dog profit me into the large state of simple
gladness to be with dog he shall never know the very essence of that
companion ship which depends not on the points of dog but on some
strange and subtle mingling of mute spirits For it is by muteness that
a dog becomes for one so utterly beyond value with him one is at peace
where words play no torturing tricks When he just sits loving and
knows that he is being loved those are the moments that I think are
precious to a dog when with his adoring soul coming through his eyes
he feels that you are really thinking of him But he is touchingly
tolerant of ones other occupations The subject of these memories
always knew when one was too absorbed in work to be so close to him as he
thought proper yet he never tried to hinder or distract or asked for
attention It dinged his mood of course so that the red under his eyes
and the folds of his crumply cheekswhich seemed to speak of a touch of
bloodhound introduced a long way back into his breedingdrew deeper and
more manifest If he could have spoken at such times he would have
said I have been a long time alone and I cannot always be asleep but
you know best and I must not criticise

He did not at all mind ones being absorbed in other humans he seemed to
enjoy the sounds of conversation lifting round him and to know when they
were sensible He could not for instance stand actors or actresses
giving readings of their parts perceiving at once that the same had no
connection with the minds and real feelings of the speakers and having
wandered a little to show his disapproval he would go to the door and
stare at it till it opened and let him out Once or twice it is true
when an actor of large voice was declaiming an emotional passage he so
far relented as to go up to him and pant in his face Music too made
him restless inclined to sigh and to ask questions Sometimes at its
first sound he would cross to the window and remain there looking for
Her At others he would simply go and lie on the loud pedal and we
never could tell whether it was from sentiment or because he thought
that in this way he heard less At one special Nocturne of Chopins he
always whimpered He was indeed of rather Polish temperamentvery gay
when he was gay dark and brooding when he was not

On the whole perhaps his life was uneventful for so fartravelling a
dog though it held its moments of eccentricity as when he leaped
through the window of a fourwheeler into Kensington or sat on a
Dartmoor adder But that was fortunately of a Sunday afternoonwhen
adder and all were torpid so nothing happened till a friend who was
following lifted him off the creature with his large boot

If only one could have known more of his private lifemore of his
relations with his own kind I fancy he was always rather a dark dog to
them having so many thoughts about us that he could not share with any
one and being naturally fastidious except with ladies for whom he had
a chivalrous and catholic taste so that they often turned and snapped at
him He had however but one lasting love affair for a livercoloured
lass of our village not quite of his own caste but a wholesome if
somewhat elderly girl with loving and sphinxlike eyes Their children
alas were not for this world and soon departed

Nor was he a fighting dog but once attacked he lacked a sense of
values being unable to distinguish between dogs that he could beat and
dogs with whom he had no earthly It was in fact as well to
interfere at once especially in the matter of retrievers for he never
forgot having in his youth been attacked by a retriever from behind No
he never forgot and never forgave an enemy Only a month before that
day of which I cannot speak being very old and ill he engaged an Irish
terrier on whose impudence he had long had his eye and routed him And
how a battle cheered his spirit He was certainly no Christian but
allowing for essential dog he was very much a gentleman And I do think
that most of us who live on this earth these days would rather leave it
with that label on us than the other For to be a Christian as Tolstoy
understood the wordand no one else in our time has had logic and love
of truth enough to give it coherent meaningis to be quite sincere not
suited to men of Western blood Whereasto be a gentleman It is a far
cry but perhaps it can be done In him at all events there was no
pettiness no meanness and no cruelty and though he fell below his
ideal at times this never altered the true look of his eyes nor the
simple loyalty in his soul

But what a crowd of memories come back bringing with them the perfume of
fallen days What delights and glamour what long hours of effort
discouragements and secret fears did he not watch overour black
familiar and with the sight and scent and touch of him deepen or
assuage How many thousand walks did we not go together so that we
still turn to see if he is following at his padding gait attentive to
the invisible trails Not the least hard thing to bear when they go from
us these quiet friends is that they carry away with them so many years
of our own lives Yet if they find warmth therein who would grudge
them those years that they have so guarded Nothing else of us can they
take to lie upon with outstretched paws and chin pressed to the ground
and whatever they take be sure they have deserved

Do they know as we do that their time must come Yes they know at
rare moments No other way can I interpret those pauses of his latter
life when propped on his forefeet he would sit for long minutes quite
motionlesshis head drooped utterly withdrawn then turn those eyes of
his and look at me That look said more plainly than all words could
Yes I know that I must go If we have spirits that persistthey
have If we know after our departure who we were they do No one I
think who really longs for truth can ever glibly say which it will be
for dog and man persistence or extinction of our consciousness There is
but one thing certainthe childishness of fretting over that eternal
question Whichever it be it must be right the only possible thing
He felt that too I know but then like his master he was what is
called a pessimist

My companion tells me that since he left us he has once come back It
was Old Years Night and she was sad when he came to her in visible
shape of his black body passing round the diningtable from the
windowend to his proper place beneath the table at her feet She saw
him quite clearly she heard the padding taptap of his paws and very
toenails she felt his warmth brushing hard against the front of her
skirt She thought then that he would settle down upon her feet but
something disturbed him and he stood pausing pressed against her then
moved out toward where I generally sit but was not sitting that night

She saw him stand there as if considering then at some sound or laugh
she became selfconscious and slowly very slowly he was no longer
there Had he some message some counsel to give something he would
say that last night of the last year of all those he had watched over
us Will he come back again

No stone stands over where he lies It is on our hearts that his life is
engraved
1912




FELICITY

When God is so good to the fields of what use are wordsthose poor
husks of sentiment There is no painting Felicity on the wing No way
of bringing on to the canvas the flying glory of things A single
buttercup of the twenty million in one field is worth all these dry
symbolsthat can never body forth the very spirit of that froth of May
breaking over the hedges the choir of birds and bees the
losttravelling down of the wind flowers the whitethroated swallows in
their Odysseys Just here there are no skylarks but what joy of song
and leaf of lanes lighted with bright trees the few oaks still golden
brown and the ashes still spiritual Only the blackbirds and thrushes
can singup this day and cuckoos over the hill The year has flown so
fast that the appletrees have dropped nearly all their bloom and in
long meadow the daggers are out early beside the narrow bright
streams Orpheus sits there on a stone when nobody is by and pipes to
the ponies and Pan can often be seen dancing with his nymphs in the
raised beechgrove where it is always twilight if you lie still enough
against the far bank

Who can believe in growing old so long as we are wrapped in this cloak
of colour and wings and song so long as this unimaginable vision is here
for us to gaze atthe softfaced sheep about us and the woolbags
drying out along the fence and great numbers of tiny ducks so trustful
that the crows have taken several

Blue is the colour of youth and all the blue flowers have a fey look
Everything seems young too young to work There is but one thing busy a
starling fetching grubs for its little family above my headit must
take that flight at least two hundred times a day The children should be
very fat

When the sky is so happy and the flowers so luminous it does not seem
possible that the bright angels of this day shall pass into dark night
that slowly these wings shall close and the cuckoo praise himself to
sleep mad midges dancein the evening the grass shiver with dew wind
die and no bird sing    

Yet so it is Day has gonethe song and glamour and swoop of wings
Slowly has passed the daily miracle It is night But Felicity has not
withdrawn she has but changed her robe for silence velvet and the
pearl fan of the moon Everything is sleeping save only a single star
and the pansies Why they should be more wakeful than the other flowers
I do not know The expressions of their faces if one bends down into
the dusk are sweeter and more cunning than ever They have some compact
no doubt in hand

What a number of voices have given up the ghost to this night of but one
voicethe murmur of the stream out there in darkness

With what religion all has been done Not one buttercup open the
yewtrees already with shadows flung down No moths are abroad yet it
is too early in the year for nightjars and the owls are quiet But who
shall say that in this silence in this hovering wan light in this air
bereft of wings and of all scent save freshness there is less of the
ineffable less of that before which words are dumb

It is strange how this tranquillity of night that seems so final is
inhabited if one keeps still enough A lamb is bleating out there on
the dim moor a bird somewhere a little one about three fields away
makes the sweetest kind of chirruping some cows are still cropping
There is a scent too underneath the freshnesssweetbrier I think and
our Dutch honeysuckle nothing else could so delicately twine itself with
air And even in this darkness the roses have colour more beautiful
perhaps than ever If colour be as they say but the effect of light on
various fibre one may think of it as a tune the song of thanksgiving
that each form puts forth to sun and moon and stars and fire These
mooncoloured roses are singing a most quiet song I see all of a sudden
that there are many more stars beside that one so red and watchful The
flown kite is there with its seven pale worlds it has adventured very
high and far tonightwith a company of others remoter still   

This serenity of night What could seem less likely ever more to move
and change again to day Surely now the world has found its long sleep
and the pearly glimmer from the moon will last and the precious silence
never again yield to clamour the grapebloom of this mystery never more
pale out into gold    

And yet it is not so The nightly miracle has passed It is dawn Faint
light has come I am waiting for the first sound The sky as yet is
like nothing but grey paper with the shadows of wild geese passing The
trees are phantoms And then it comesthat first call of a bird
startled at discovering day Just one calland now here there on all
the trees the sudden answers swelling of that most sweet and careless
choir Was irresponsibility ever so divine as this of birds waking
Thensaffron into the sky and once more silence What is it birds do
after the first Chorale Think of their sins and business Or just
sleep again The trees are fast dropping unreality and the cuckoos
begin calling Colour is burning up in the flowers already the dew
smells of them

The miracle is ended for the starling has begun its job and the sun is
fretting those dark busy wings with gold Full day has come again But
the face of it is a little strange it is not like yesterday Queerto
think no day is like to a day thats past and no night like a night
thats coming Why then fear death which is but night Why care if
next day have different face and spirit The sun has lighted
buttercupfield now the wind touches the limetree Something passes
over me away up there

It is Felicity on her wings

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff
