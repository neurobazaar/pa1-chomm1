I

Miss Miranda Sawyers oldfashioned garden was the pleasantest spot in
Riverboro on a sunny July morning The rich color of the brick house
gleamed and glowed through the shade of the elms and maples Luxuriant
hopvines clambered up the lightning rods and water spouts hanging
their delicate clusters here and there in graceful profusion Woodbine
transformed the old shed and tool house to things of beauty and the
flower beds themselves were the prettiest and most fragrant in all
the countryside A row of dahlias ran directly around the garden
spotdahlias scarlet gold and variegated In the very centre was a
round plot where the upturned faces of a thousand pansies smiled amid
their leaves and in the four corners were triangular blocks of sweet
phlox over which the butterflies fluttered unceasingly In the spaces
between ran a riot of portulaca and nasturtiums while in the more
regular shellbordered beds grew spirea and gillyflowers mignonette
marigolds and clove pinks

Back of the barn and encroaching on the edge of the hay field was a
grove of sweet clover whose white feathery tips fairly bent under the
assaults of the bees while banks of aromatic mint and thyme drank
in the sunshine and sent it out again into the summer air warm and
deliciously odorous

The hollyhocks were Miss Sawyers pride and they grew in a stately line
beneath the four kitchen windows their tapering tips set thickly with
gay satin circlets of pink or lavender or crimson

They grow something like steeples thought little Rebecca Randall who
was weeding the bed and the flat round flowers are like rosettes but
steeples wouldnt be studded with rosettes so if you were writing about
them in a composition youd have to give up one or the other and I
think Ill give up the steeples

 Gay little hollyhock
 Lifting your head
 Sweetly rosetted
 Out from your bed

Its a pity the hollyhock isnt really little instead of steepling up
to the window top but I cant say Gay TALL hollyhock I might
have it Lines to a Hollyhock in May for then it would be small but
oh no I forgot in May it wouldnt be blooming and its so pretty
to say that its head is sweetly rosetted I wish the teacher wasnt
away she would like sweetly rosetted and she would like to hear me
recite Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll that I learned
out of Aunt Janes Byron the rolls come booming out of it just like the
waves at the beach I could make nice compositions now everything
is blooming so and its so warm and sunny and happy outdoors Miss
Dearborn told me to write something in my thought book every single day
and Ill begin this very night when I go to bed

Rebecca Rowena Randall the little niece of the brickhouse ladies and
at present sojourning there for purposes of board lodging education
and incidentally such discipline and chastening as might ultimately
produce moral excellenceRebecca Randall had a passion for the rhyme
and rhythm of poetry From her earliest childhood words had always been
to her what dolls and toys are to other children and now at twelve she
amused herself with phrases and sentences and images as her schoolmates
played with the pieces of their dissected puzzles If the heroine of
a story took a cursory glance about her apartment Rebecca would
shortly ask her Aunt Jane to take a cursory glance at her oversewing
or hemming if the villain aided and abetted someone in committing
a crime she would before long request the pleasure of aiding and
abetting in dishwashing or bedmaking Sometimes she used the borrowed
phrases unconsciously sometimes she brought them into the conversation
with an intense sense of pleasure in their harmony or appropriateness
for a beautiful word or sentence had the same effect upon her
imagination as a fragrant nosegay a strain of music or a brilliant
sunset

How are you gettin on Rebecca Rowena called a peremptory voice from
within

Pretty good Aunt Miranda only I wish flowers would ever come up as
thick as this pigweed and plantain and sorrel What MAKES weeds be thick
and flowers be thinI just happened to be stopping to think a minute
when you looked out

You think considerable more than you weed I guess by appearances How
many times have you peeked into that humming birds nest Why dont you
work all to once and play all to once like other folks

I dont know the child answered confounded by the question and
still more by the apparent logic back of it I dont know Aunt
Miranda but when Im working outdoors such a Saturday morning as this
the whole creation just screams to me to stop it and come and play

Well you neednt go if it does responded her aunt sharply It dont
scream to me when Im rollin out these doughnuts and it wouldnt to
you if your mind was on your duty

Rebeccas little brown hands flew in and out among the weeds as she
thought rebelliously Creation WOULDNT scream to Aunt Miranda it
would know she wouldnt come

 Scream on thou bright and gay creation scream
 Tis not Miranda that will hear thy cry

Oh such funny nice things come into my head out here by myself I do
wish I could run up and put them down in my thought book before I forget
them but Aunt Miranda wouldnt like me to leave off weeding

 Rebecca was weeding the hollyhock bed
 When wonderful thoughts came into her head
 Her aunt was occupied with the rolling pin
 And the thoughts of her mind were common and thin

That wouldnt do because its mean to Aunt Miranda and anyway it isnt
good I MUST crawl under the syringa shade a minute its so hot and
anybody has to stop working once in a while just to get their breath
even if they werent making poetry

Rebecca was weeding the hollyhock bed When marvelous thoughts came into
her head Miranda was wielding the rolling pin And thoughts at such
times seemed to her as a sin

How pretty the hollyhock rosettes look from down here on the sweet
smelly ground

Let me see what would go with rosetting AIDING AND ABETTING PETTING
HENSETTING FRETTINGtheres nothing very nice but I can make
fretting do

 Cheered by Rowenas petting
 The flowers are rosetting
 But Aunt Mirandas fretting
 Doth somewhat cloud the day

Suddenly the sound of wagon wheels broke the silence and then a voice
called outa voice that could not wait until the feet that belonged to
it reached the spot Miss SawYER Fathers got to drive over to North
Riverboro on an errand and please can Rebecca go too as its Saturday
morning and vacation besides

Rebecca sprang out from under the syringa bush eyes flashing with
delight as only Rebeccas eyes COULD flash her face one luminous circle
of joyous anticipation She clapped her grubby hands and dancing up
and down cried May I Aunt Mirandacan I Aunt Janecan I Aunt
MirandaJane Im more than half through the bed

If you finish your weeding tonight before sundown I spose you can go
so long as Mr Perkins has been good enough to ask you responded Miss
Sawyer reluctantly Take off that gingham apron and wash your hands
clean at the pump You aint ben out o bed but two hours an your head
looks as rough as if youd slep in it That comes from layin on the
ground same as a caterpillar Smooth your hair down with your hands an
praps Emma Jane can braid it as you go along the road Run up and get
your secondbest hair ribbon out o your upper drawer and put on
your shade hat No you cant wear your coral chainjewelry aint
appropriate in the morning How long do you callate to be gone Emma
Jane

I dont know Fathers just been sent for to see about a sick woman
over to North Riverboro Shes got to go to the poor farm

This fragment of news speedily brought Miss Sawyer and her sister Jane
as well to the door which commanded a view of Mr Perkins and his
wagon Mr Perkins the father of Rebeccas bosom friend was primarily
a blacksmith and secondarily a selectman and an overseer of the poor a
man therefore possessed of wide and varied information

Who is it thats sick inquired Miranda

A woman over to North Riverboro

Whats the trouble

Cant say

Stranger

Yes and no shes that wild daughter of old Nate Perry that used to
live up towards Moderation You remember she ran away to work in the
factory at Milltown and married a donothin fellow by the name o John
Winslow

Yes well where is he Why dont he take care of her

They aint worked well in double harness Theyve been rovin round the
country livin a month here and a month there wherever they could get
work and houseroom They quarreled a couple o weeks ago and he left
her She and the little boy kind o camped out in an old loggin cabin
back in the woods and she took in washin for a spell then she got
terrible sick and aint expected to live

Whos been nursing her inquired Miss Jane

Lizy Ann Dennett that lives nearest neighbor to the cabin but I
guess shes tired out bein good Samaritan Anyways she sent word this
mornin that nobody cant seem to find John Winslow that there aint
no relations and the towns got to be responsible so Im goin over to
see how the land lays Climb in Rebecca You an Emmy Jane crowd back
on the cushion an Ill set forrard Thats the trick Now were off

Dear dear sighed Jane Sawyer as the sisters walked back into the
brick house I remember once seeing Sally Perry at meeting She was a
handsome girl and Im sorry shes come to grief

If shed kep on goin to meetin an hadnt looked at the men folks
she might a ben earnin an honest livin this minute said Miranda
Men folks are at the bottom of everything wrong in this world she
continued unconsciously reversing the verdict of history

Then we ought to be a happy and contented community here in Riverboro
replied Jane as theres six women to one man

If t was sixteen to one wed be all the safer responded Miranda
grimly putting the doughnuts in a brown crock in the cellarway and
slamming the door


II

The Perkins horse and wagon rumbled along over the dusty country road
and after a discreet silence maintained as long as human flesh could
endure Rebecca remarked sedately

Its a sad errand for such a shiny morning isnt it Mr Perkins

Plenty o trouble in the world Rebecky shiny mornins an all that
good man replied If you want a bed to lay on a roof over your head
an food to eat youve got to work for em If I hadnt a labored early
an late learned my trade an denied myself when I was young I might
a ben a pauper layin sick in a loggin cabin stead o bein an
overseer o the poor an selectman drivin along to take the pauper to
the poor farm

People that are mortgaged dont have to go to the poor farm do they
Mr Perkins asked Rebecca with a shiver of fear as she remembered her
home farm at Sunnybrook and the debt upon it a debt which had lain like
a shadow over her childhood

Bless your soul no not unless they fail to pay up but Sal Perry an
her husband hadnt got fur enough along in life to BE mortgaged You
have to own something before you can mortgage it

Rebeccas heart bounded as she learned that a mortgage represented a
certain stage in worldly prosperity

Well she said sniffing in the fragrance of the newmown hay and
growing hopeful as she did so maybe the sick woman will be better such
a beautiful day and maybe the husband will come back to make it up and
say hes sorry and sweet content will reign in the humble habitation
that was once the scene of poverty grief and despair Thats how it
came out in a story Im reading

I haint noticed that life comes out like stories very much responded
the pessimistic blacksmith who as Rebecca privately thought had read
less than half a dozen books in his long and prosperous career

A drive of three or four miles brought the party to a patch of woodland
where many of the tall pines had been hewn the previous winter The roof
of a ramshackle hut was outlined against a background of young birches
and a rough path made in hauling the logs to the main road led directly
to its door

As they drew near the figure of a woman approachedMrs Lizy Ann
Dennett in a gingham dress with a calico apron over her head

Good morning Mr Perkins said the woman who looked tired and
irritable Im real glad you come right over for she took worse after
I sent you word and shes dead

Dead The word struck heavily and mysteriously on the childrens ears
Dead And their young lives just begun stretched on and on all
decked like hope in living green Dead And all the rest of the world
reveling in strength Dead With all the daisies and buttercups waving
in the fields and the men heaping the mown grass into fragrant cocks
or tossing it into heavily laden carts Dead With the brooks tinkling
after the summer showers with the potatoes and corn blossoming the
birds singing for joy and every little insect humming and chirping
adding its note to the blithe chorus of warm throbbing life

I was all alone with her She passed away suddenly jest about break o
day said Lizy Ann Dennett

Her soul passed upward to its God Just at the break of day

These words came suddenly into Rebeccas mind from a tiny chamber where
such things were wont to lie quietly until something brought them to the
surface She could not remember whether she had heard them at a funeral
or read them in the hymn book or made them up out of her own head but
she was so thrilled with the idea of dying just as the dawn was breaking
that she scarcely heard Mrs Dennetts conversation

I sent for Aunt Beulah Day an shes ben here an laid her out
continued the long suffering Lizy Ann She aint got any folks an
John Winslow aint never had any as far back as I can remember She
belongs to your town and youll have to bury her and take care of
Jackythats the boy Hes seventeen months old a bright little
feller the image o John but I cant keep him another day Im all
wore out my own babys sick mothers rheumatiz is extry bad and my
husbands comin home tonight from his weeks work If he finds a child
o John Winslows under his roof I cant say what would happen youll
have to take him back with you to the poor farm

I cant take him up there this afternoon objected Mr Perkins

Well then keep him over Sunday yourself hes good as a kitten John
Winslowll hear o Sals death sooner or later unless hes gone out of
the state altogether an when he knows the boys at the poor farm I
kind o think hell come and claim him Could you drive me over to the
village to see about the coffin and would you children be afraid to
stay here alone for a spell she asked turning to the girls

Afraid they both echoed uncomprehendingly

Lizy Ann and Mr Perkins perceiving that the fear of a dead presence
had not entered the minds of Rebecca or Emma Jane said nothing but
drove off together counseling them not to stray far away from the cabin
and promising to be back in an hour

There was not a house within sight either looking up or down the shady
road and the two girls stood hand in hand watching the wagon out of
sight then they sat down quietly under a tree feeling all at once a
nameless depression hanging over their gay summermorning spirits

It was very still in the woods just the chirp of a grasshopper now
and then or the note of a bird or the click of a fardistant mowing
machine

Were WATCHING whispered Emma Jane They watched with Granpa
Perkins and there was a great funeral and two ministers He left two
thousand dollars in the bank and a store full of goods and a paper
thing you could cut tickets off of twice a year and they were just like
money

They watched with my little sister Mira too said Rebecca You
remember when she died and I went home to Sunnybrook Farm It was
winter time but she was covered with evergreen and white pinks and
there was singing

There wont be any funeral or ministers or singing here will there
Isnt that awful

I spose not and oh Emma Jane no flowers either We might get those
for her if theres nobody else to do it

Would you dare put them on to her asked Emma Jane in a hushed voice

I dont know I cant tell it makes me shiver but of course we
COULD do it if we were the only friends she had Lets look into
the cabin first and be perfectly sure that there arent any Are you
afraid

Nno I guess not I looked at Granpa Perkins and he was just the
same as ever

At the door of the hut Emma Janes courage suddenly departed She
held back shuddering and refused either to enter or look in Rebecca
shuddered too but kept on drawn by an insatiable curiosity about life
and death an overmastering desire to know and feel and understand the
mysteries of existence a hunger for knowledge and experience at all
hazards and at any cost

Emma Jane hurried softly away from the felt terrors of the cabin and
after two or three minutes of utter silence Rebecca issued from the
open door her sensitive face pale and woebegone the everready tears
raining down her cheeks She ran toward the edge of the wood sinking
down by Emma Janes side and covering her eyes sobbed with excitement

Oh Emma Jane she hasnt got a flower and shes so tired and
sadlooking as if shed been hurt and hurt and never had any good
times and theres a weeny weeny baby side of her Oh I wish I hadnt
gone in

Emma Jane blenched for an instant Mrs Dennett never said THERE WAS
TWO DEAD ONES ISNT THAT DREADFUL But she continued her practical
common sense coming to the rescue youve been in once and its all
over it wont be so bad when you take in the flowers because youll
be used to it The goldenrod hasnt begun to bud so theres nothing
to pick but daisies Shall I make a long rope of them as I did for the
schoolroom

Yes said Rebecca wiping her eyes and still sobbing Yes thats the
prettiest and if we put it all round her like a frame the undertaker
couldnt be so cruel as to throw it away even if she is a pauper
because it will look so beautiful From what the Sunday school lessons
say shes only asleep now and when she wakes up shell be in heaven

THERES ANOTHER PLACE said Emma Jane in an orthodox and sepulchral
whisper as she took her everpresent ball of crochet cotton from her
pocket and began to twine the whiteweed blossoms into a rope

Oh well Rebecca replied with the easy theology that belonged to her
temperament They simply couldnt send her DOWN THERE with that little
weeny baby Whod take care of it You know page six of the catechism
says the only companions of the wicked after death are their father the
devil and all the other evil angels it wouldnt be any place to bring
up a baby

Whenever and wherever she wakes up I hope she wont know that the big
baby is going to the poor farm I wonder where he is

Perhaps over to Mrs Dennetts house She didnt seem sorry a bit did
she

No but I suppose shes tired sitting up and nursing a stranger Mother
wasnt sorry when Granpa Perkins died she couldnt be for he was
cross all the time and had to be fed like a child Why ARE you crying
again Rebecca

Oh I dont know I cant tell Emma Jane Only I dont want to die and
have no funeral or singing and nobody sorry for me I just couldnt bear
it

Neither could I Emma Jane responded sympathetically but praps
if were real good and die young before we have to be fed they will
be sorry I do wish you could write some poetry for her as you did for
Alice Robinsons canary bird only still better of course like that
you read me out of your thought book

I could easy enough exclaimed Rebecca somewhat consoled by the
idea that her rhyming faculty could be of any use in such an emergency
Though I dont know but it would be kind of bold to do it Im all
puzzled about how people get to heaven after theyre buried I cant
understand it a bit but if the poetry is on her what if that should
go too And how could I write anything good enough to be read out loud
in heaven

A little piece of paper couldnt get to heaven it just couldnt
asserted Emma Jane decisively It would be all blown to pieces and
dried up And nobody knows that the angels can read writing anyway

They must be as educated as we are and more so too agreed Rebecca
They must be more than just dead people or else why should they have
wings But Ill go off and write something while you finish the rope
its lucky you brought your crochet cotton and I my lead pencil

In fifteen or twenty minutes she returned with some lines written on a
scrap of brown wrapping paper Standing soberly by Emma Jane she said
preparing to read them aloud Theyre not good I was afraid your
fatherd come back before I finished and the first verse sounds exactly
like the funeral hymns in the church book I couldnt call her Sally
Winslow it didnt seem nice when I didnt know her and she is dead so
I thought if I said friend it would show she had somebody to be sorry

 This friend of ours has died and gone
 From us to heaven to live
 If she has sinned against Thee Lord
 We pray Thee Lord forgive

 Her husband runneth far away
 And knoweth not shes dead
 Oh bring him backere tis too late
 To mourn beside her bed

 And if perchance it cant be so
 Be to the children kind
 The weeny one that goes with her
 The other left behind

I think thats perfectly elegant exclaimed Emma Jane kissing Rebecca
fervently You are the smartest girl in the whole State of Maine and
it sounds like a ministers prayer I wish we could save up and buy a
printing machine Then I could learn to print what you write and wed
be partners like father and Bill Moses Shall you sign it with your name
like we do our school compositions

No said Rebecca soberly I certainly shant sign it not knowing
where its going or wholl read it I shall just hide it in the flowers
and whoever finds it will guess that there wasnt any minister or
singing or gravestone or anything so somebody just did the best they
could


III

The tired mother with the weeny baby on her arm lay on a long
carpenters bench her earthly journey over and when Rebecca stole
in and placed the flowery garland all along the edge of the rude bier
death suddenly took on a more gracious and benign aspect It was only
a childs sympathy and intuition that softened the rigors of the sad
moment but poor wild Sal Winslow in her frame of daisies looked
as if she were missed a little by an unfriendly world while the weeny
baby whose heart had fallen asleep almost as soon as it had learned to
beat the weeny baby with Emma Janes nosegay of buttercups in its tiny
wrinkled hand smiled as if it might have been loved and longed for and
mourned

Weve done all we can now without a minister whispered Rebecca We
could sing God is ever good out of the Sunday school song book but
Im afraid somebody would hear us and think we were gay and happy
Whats that

A strange sound broke the stillness a gurgle a yawn a merry little
call The two girls ran in the direction from which it came and there
on an old coat in a clump of goldenrod bushes lay a child just waking
from a refreshing nap

Its the other baby that Lizy Ann Dennett told about cried Emma Jane

Isnt he beautiful exclaimed Rebecca Come straight to me and she
stretched out her arms

The child struggled to its feet and tottered wavering toward the warm
welcome of the voice and eyes Rebecca was all mother and her maternal
instincts had been well developed in the large family in which she was
next to the eldest She had always confessed that there were perhaps a
trifle too many babies at Sunnybrook Farm but nevertheless had she
ever heard it she would have stood loyally by the Japanese proverb
Whether brought forth upon the mountain or in the field it matters
nothing more than a treasure of one thousand ryo a baby precious is

You darling thing she crooned as she caught and lifted the child
You look just like a Jackolantern

The boy was clad in a yellow cotton dress very full and stiff His hair
was of such a bright gold and so sleek and shiny that he looked like
a fair smooth little pumpkin He had wide blue eyes full of laughter
a neat little vertical nose a neat little horizontal mouth with his
few neat little teeth showing very plainly and on the whole Rebeccas
figure of speech was not so wide of the mark

Oh Emma Jane Isnt he too lovely to go to the poor farm If only we
were married we could keep him and say nothing and nobody would know the
difference Now that the Simpsons have gone away there isnt a single
baby in Riverboro and only one in Edgewood Its a perfect shame but
I cant do anything you remember Aunt Miranda wouldnt let me have the
Simpson baby when I wanted to borrow her just for one rainy Sunday

My mother wont keep him so its no use to ask her she says most
every day shes glad were grown up and she thanks the Lord there
wasnt but two of us

And Mrs Peter Meserve is too nervous Rebecca went on taking the
village houses in turn and Mrs Robinson is too neat

People dont seem to like any but their own babies observed Emma
Jane

Well I cant understand it Rebecca answered A babys a baby I
should think whose ever it is Miss Dearborn is coming back Monday
I wonder if shed like it She has nothing to do out of school and we
could borrow it all the time

I dont think it would seem very genteel for a young lady like Miss
Dearborn who boards round to take a baby from place to place
objected Emma Jane

Perhaps not agreed Rebecca despondently but I think if we havent
got anyanyPRIVATE babies in Riverboro we ought to have one for the
town and all have a share in it Weve got a town hall and a town lamp
post and a town watering trough Things are so uneven One house like
mine at Sunnybrook brimful of children and the very next one empty
The only way to fix them right would be to let all the babies that ever
are belong to all the grownup people that ever arejust divide
them up you know if theyd go round Oh I have a thought Dont
you believe Aunt Sarah Cobb would keep him She carries flowers to the
graveyard every little while and once she took me with her Theres a
marble cross and it says SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF SARAH ELLEN BELOVED
CHILD OF SARAH AND JEREMIAH COBB AGED 17 MONTHS Why thats another
reason Mrs Dennett says this one is seventeen months Theres five of
us left at the farm without me but if we were only nearer to Riverboro
how quick mother would let in one more

We might see what father thinks and that would settle it said Emma
Jane Father doesnt think very sudden but he thinks awful strong If
we dont bother him and find a place ourselves for the baby perhaps
hell be willing Hes coming now I hear the wheels

Lizy Ann Dennett volunteered to stay and perform the last rites with
the undertaker and Jackolantern with his slender wardrobe tied in
a bandanna handkerchief was lifted into the wagon by the reluctant Mr
Perkins and jubilantly held by Rebecca in her lap Mr Perkins drove
off as speedily as possible being heartily sick of the whole affair
and thinking wisely that the little girls had already seen and heard
more than enough of the seamy side of life that morning

Discussion concerning Jackolanterns future was prudently deferred
for a quarter of an hour and then Mr Perkins was mercilessly pelted
with arguments against the choice of the poor farm as a place of
residence for a baby

His father is sure to come back some time Mr Perkins urged Rebecca
He couldnt leave this beautiful thing forever and if Emma Jane and I
can persuade Mrs Cobb to keep him a little while would you care

No on reflection Mr Perkins did not care He merely wanted a quiet
life and enough time left over from the public service to attend to his
blacksmiths shop so instead of going home over the same road by which
they came he crossed the bridge into Edgewood and dropped the children
at the long lane which led to the Cobb house

Mrs Cobb Aunt Sarah to the whole village sat by the window looking
for Uncle Jerry who would soon be seen driving the noon stage to the
post office over the hill She always had an eye out for Rebecca too
for ever since the child had been a passenger on Mr Cobbs stagecoach
making the eventful trip from her home farm to the brick house in
Riverboro in his company she had been a constant visitor and the joy
of the quiet household Emma Jane too was a wellknown figure in the
lane but the strange baby was in the nature of a surprisea surprise
somewhat modified by the fact that Rebecca was a dramatic personage and
more liable to appear in conjunction with curious outriders comrades
and retainers than the ordinary Riverboro child She had run away from
the too stern discipline of the brick house on one occasion and had
been persuaded to return by Uncle Jerry She had escorted a wandering
organ grinder to their door and begged a lodging for him on a rainy
night so on the whole there was nothing amazing about the coming
procession

The little party toiled up to the hospitable door and Mrs Cobb came
out to meet them

Rebecca was spokesman Emma Janes talent did not lie in eloquent
speech but it would have been a valiant and a fluent child indeed
who could have usurped Rebeccas privileges and tendencies in this
direction language being her native element and words of assorted
sizes springing spontaneously to her lips

Aunt Sarah dear she said plumping Jackolantern down on the grass
as she pulled his dress over his feet and smoothed his hair becomingly
will you please not say a word till I get throughas its very
important you should know everything before you answer yes or no
This is a baby named Jacky Winslow and I think he looks like a
Jackolantern His mother has just died over to North Riverboro all
alone excepting for Mrs Lizy Ann Dennett and there was another little
weeny baby that died with her and Emma Jane and I put flowers
around them and did the best we could The fatherthats John
Winslowquarreled with the motherthat was Sal Perry on the Moderation
Roadand ran away and left her So he doesnt know his wife and the
weeny baby are dead And the town has got to bury them because they
cant find the father right off quick and Jacky has got to go to the
poor farm this afternoon And it seems an awful shame to take him up to
that lonesome place with those old people that cant amuse him and
if Emma Jane and Alice Robinson and I take most all the care of him we
thought perhaps you and Uncle Jerry would keep him just for a little
while Youve got a cow and a turnup bedstead you know she hurried
on insinuatingly and theres hardly any pleasure as cheap as more
babies where theres ever been any before for baby carriages and
trundle beds and cradles dont wear out and theres always clothes
left over from the old baby to begin the new one on Of course we can
collect enough things to start Jacky so he wont be much trouble or
expense and anyway hes past the most troublesome age and you wont
have to be up nights with him and he isnt afraid of anybody or
anything as you can see by his just sitting there laughing and sucking
his thumb though he doesnt know whats going to become of him And
hes just seventeen months old like dear little Sarah Ellen in the
graveyard and we thought we ought to give you the refusal of him before
he goes to the poor farm and what do you think about it Because its
near my dinner time and Aunt Miranda will keep me in the whole afternoon
if Im late and Ive got to finish weeding the hollyhock bed before
sundown

IV

Mrs Cobb had enjoyed a considerable period of reflection during this
monologue and Jacky had not used the time unwisely offering several
unconscious arguments and suggestions to the matter under discussion
lurching over on the greensward and righting himself with a chuckle
kicking his bare feet about in delight at the sunshine and groping for
his toes with arms too short to reach them the movement involving an
entire upsetting of equilibrium followed by more chuckles

Coming down the last of the stone steps Sarah Ellens mother regarded
the baby with interest and sympathy

Poor little mite she said that doesnt know what hes lost and
whats going to happen to him Seems to me we might keep him a spell
till were sure his fathers deserted him for good Want to come to Aunt
Sarah baby

Jackolantern turned from Rebecca and Emma Jane and regarded the kind
face gravely then he held out both his hands and Mrs Cobb stooping
gathered him like a harvest Being lifted into her arms he at once tore
her spectacles from her nose and laughed aloud Taking them from him
gently she put them on again and set him in the cushioned rocking
chair under the lilac bushes beside the steps Then she took one of his
soft hands in hers and patted it and fluttered her fingers like birds
before his eyes and snapped them like castanets remembering all the
arts she had lavished upon Sarah Ellen aged seventeen months years
and years ago

 Motherless baby and babyless mother
 Bring them together to love one another

Rebecca knew nothing of this couplet but she saw clearly enough that
her case was won

The boy must be hungry when was he fed last asked Mrs Cobb Just
stay a second longer while I get him some mornings milk then you
run home to your dinners and Ill speak to Mr Cobb this afternoon Of
course we can keep the baby for a week or two till we see what happens
Land He aint goin to be any more trouble than a wax doll I guess he
aint been used to much attention and that kinds always the easiest to
take care of

At six oclock that evening Rebecca and Emma Jane flew up the hill and
down the lane again waving their hands to the dear old couple who were
waiting for them in the usual place the back piazza where they had sat
so many summers in a blessed companionship never marred by an unloving
word

Wheres Jacky called Rebecca breathlessly her voice always
outrunning her feet

Go up to my chamber both of you if you want to see smiled Mrs
Cobb only dont wake him up

The girls went softly up the stairs into Aunt Sarahs room There in
the turnup bedstead that had been so long empty slept Jackolantern
in blissful unconsciousness of the doom he had so lately escaped His
nightgown and pillow case were clean and fragrant with lavender but
they were both as yellow as saffron for they had belonged to Sarah
Ellen

I wish his mother could see him whispered Emma Jane

You cant tell its all puzzly about heaven and perhaps she does
said Rebecca as they turned reluctantly from the fascinating scene and
stole down to the piazza

It was a beautiful and a happy summer that year and every day it was
filled with blissful plays and still more blissful duties On the
Monday after Jackolanterns arrival in Edgewood Rebecca founded the
Riverboro Aunts Association The Aunts were Rebecca Emma Jane Alice
Robinson and Minnie Smellie and each of the first three promised
to labor for and amuse the visiting baby for two days a week Minnie
Smellie who lived at some distance from the Cobbs making herself
responsible for Saturday afternoons

Minnie Smellie was not a general favorite among the Riverboro girls and
it was only in an unprecedented burst of magnanimity that they admitted
her into the rites of fellowship Rebecca hugging herself secretly at
the thought that as Minnie gave only the leisure time of one day a
week she could not be called a full Aunt There had been long and
bitter feuds between the two children during Rebeccas first summer in
Riverboro but since Mrs Smellie had told her daughter that one more
quarrel would invite a punishment so terrible that it could only be
hinted at vaguely and Miss Miranda Sawyer had remarked that any niece
of hers who couldnt get along peaceable with the neighbors had better
go back to the seclusion of a farm where there werent any hostilities
had been veiled and a suave and diplomatic relationship had replaced
the former one which had been wholly primitive direct and barbaric
Still whenever Minnie Smellie flaxenhaired pinknosed and
ferreteyed indulged in fluent conversation Rebecca remembering the
old fairy story could always see toads hopping out of her mouth It was
really very unpleasant because Minnie could never see them herself and
what was more amazing Emma Jane perceived nothing of the sort being
almost as blind too to the diamonds that fell continually from
Rebeccas lips but Emma Janes strong point was not her imagination

A shaky perambulator was found in Mrs Perkinss wonderful attic shoes
and stockings were furnished by Mrs Robinson Miss Jane Sawyer knitted
a blanket and some shirts Thirza Meserve though too young for an aunt
coaxed from her mother some dresses and nightgowns and was presented
with a green paper certificate allowing her to wheel Jacky up and down
the road for an hour under the superintendence of a full Aunt Each
girl under the constitution of the association could call Jacky hers
for two days in the week and great though friendly was the rivalry
between them as they washed ironed and sewed for their adored nephew

If Mrs Cobb had not been the most amiable woman in the world she might
have had difficulty in managing the aunts but she always had Jacky to
herself the earlier part of the day and after dusk at night

Meanwhile Jackolantern grew healthier and heartier and jollier as the
weeks slipped away Uncle Jerry joined the little company of worshipers
and slaves and one fear alone stirred in all their hearts not as a
sensible and practical person might imagine the fear that the recreant
father might never return to claim his child but on the contrary that
he MIGHT do so

October came at length with its cheery days and frosty nights its glory
of crimson leaves and its golden harvest of pumpkins and ripened corn
Rebecca had been down by the Edgewood side of the river and had come
up across the pastures for a goodnight play with Jacky Her literary
labors had been somewhat interrupted by the joys and responsibilities of
vicemotherhood and the thought book was less frequently drawn from its
hiding place under the old haymow in the barn chamber

Mrs Cobb stood behind the screen door with her face pressed against the
wire netting and Rebecca could see that she was wiping her eyes

All at once the childs heart gave one prophetic throb and then stood
still She was like a harp that vibrated with every wind of emotion
whether from anothers grief or her own

She looked down the lane around the curve of the stone wall red with
woodbine the lane that would meet the stage road to the station There
just mounting the crown of the hill and about to disappear on the other
side strode a stranger man big and tall with a crop of reddish curly
hair showing from under his straw hat A woman walked by his side and
perched on his shoulder wearing his most radiant and triumphant mien
as joyous in leaving Edgewood as he had been during every hour of his
sojourn thererode Jackolantern

Rebecca gave a cry in which maternal longing and helpless hopeless
jealousy strove for supremacy Then with an impetuous movement she
started to run after the disappearing trio

Mrs Cobb opened the door hastily calling after her Rebecca Rebecca
come back here You mustnt follow where you havent any right to go If
thered been anything to say or do Id a done it

Hes mine Hes mine stormed Rebecca At least hes yours and mine

Hes his fathers first of all faltered Mrs Cobb dont lets
forget that and wed ought to be glad and grateful that John Winslows
come to his senses an remembers hes brought a child into the world and
ought to take care of it Our loss is his gain and it may make a man of
him Come in and well put things away all neat before your Uncle Jerry
gets home

Rebecca sank in a pitiful little heap on Mrs Cobbs bedroom floor
and sobbed her heart out Oh Aunt Sarah where shall we get another
Jackolantern and how shall I break it to Emma Jane What if his
father doesnt love him and what if he forgets to strain the milk or
lets him go without his nap Thats the worst of babies that arent
privateyou have to part with them sooner or later

Sometimes you have to part with your own too said Mrs Cobb sadly
and though there were lines of sadness in her face there was neither
rebellion nor repining as she folded up the sides of the turnup
bedstead preparatory to banishing it a second time to the attic I
shall miss Sarah Ellen now moren ever Still Rebecca we mustnt feel
to complain Its the Lord that giveth and the Lord that taketh away
Blessed be the name of the Lord




Second Chronicle DAUGHTERS OF ZION


I

Abijah Flagg was driving over to Wareham on an errand for old Squire
Winship whose general choreboy and farmers assistant he had been for
some years

He passed Emma Jane Perkinss house slowly as he always did She was
only a little girl of thirteen and he a boy of fifteen or sixteen but
somehow for no particular reason he liked to see the sun shine on her
thick braids of reddishbrown hair He admired her chinablue eyes too
and her amiable friendly expression He was quite alone in the world
and he always thought that if he had anybody belonging to him he would
rather have a sister like Emma Jane Perkins than anything else within
the power of Providence to bestow When she herself suggested this
relationship a few years later he cast it aside with scorn having
changed his mind in the intervalbut that story belongs to another time
and place

Emma Jane was not to be seen in garden field or at the window and
Abijah turned his gaze to the large brick house that came next on the
other side of the quiet village street It might have been closed for
a funeral Neither Miss Miranda nor Miss Jane Sawyer sat at their
respective windows knitting nor was Rebecca Randalls gypsy face to be
discerned Ordinarily that willothe wispish little person could be
seen heard or felt wherever she was

The village must be abed I guess mused Abijah as he neared the
Robinsons yellow cottage where all the blinds were closed and no sign
of life showed on porch or in shed No t aint neither he thought
again as his horse crept cautiously down the hill for from the
direction of the Robinsons barn chamber there floated out into the air
certain burning sentiments set to the tune of Antioch The words to a
lad brought up in the orthodox faith were quite distinguishable

Daughter of Zion from the dust Exalt thy fallen head

Even the most religious youth is stronger on first lines than others
but Abijah pulled up his horse and waited till he caught another
familiar verse beginning

Rebuild thy walls thy bounds enlarge And send thy heralds forth

Thats Rebecca carrying the air and I can hear Emma Janes alto

 Say to the North
 Give up thy charge
 And hold not back O South
 And hold not back O South etc

Land aint they smart seesawin up and down in that part they learnt
in singin school I wonder what theyre actin out singin hymntunes
up in the barn chamber Some o Rebeccas doins Ill be bound Git dap
Aleck

Aleck pursued his serene and steady trot up the hills on the Edgewood
side of the river till at length he approached the green Common where
the old Tory Hill meetinghouse stood its white paint and green blinds
showing fair and pleasant in the afternoon sun Both doors were open
and as Abijah turned into the Wareham road the church melodeon pealed
out the opening bars of the Missionary Hymn and presently a score of
voices sent the good old tune from the choirloft out to the dusty road

 Shall we whose souls are lighted
 With Wisdom from on high
 Shall we to men benighted
 The lamp of life deny

Land exclaimed Abijah under his breath Theyre at it up here too
That explains it all Theres a missionary meeting at the church and
the girls want allowed to come so they held one of their own and I
bate ye its the liveliest of the two

Abijah Flaggs shrewd Yankee guesses were not far from the truth though
he was not in possession of all the facts It will be remembered by
those who have been in the way of hearing Rebeccas experiences in
Riverboro that the Rev and Mrs Burch returned missionaries from the
Far East together with some of their children all born under Syrian
skies as they always explained to interested inquirers spent a day or
two at the brick house and gave parlor meetings in native costume

These visitors coming straight from foreign lands to the little Maine
village brought with them a nameless enchantment to the children and
especially to Rebecca whose imagination always kindled easily The
romance of that visit had never died in her heart and among the many
careers that dazzled her youthful vision was that of converting such
Syrian heathen as might continue in idol worship after the Burches
efforts in their behalf had ceased She thought at the age of eighteen
she might be suitably equipped for storming some minor citadel of
Mohammedanism and Mrs Burch had encouraged her in the idea not it is
to be feared because Rebecca showed any surplus of virtue or Christian
grace but because her gift of language her tact and sympathy and her
musical talent seemed to fit her for the work

It chanced that the quarterly meeting of the Maine Missionary Society
had been appointed just at the time when a letter from Mrs Burch to
Miss Jane Sawyer suggested that Rebecca should form a childrens branch
in Riverboro Mrs Burchs real idea was that the young people should
save their pennies and divert a gentle stream of financial aid into
the parent fund thus learning early in life to be useful in such work
either at home or abroad

The girls themselves however read into her letter no such modest
participation in the conversion of the world and wishing to effect an
organization without delay they chose an afternoon when every house in
the village was vacant and seized upon the Robinsons barn chamber as
the place of meeting

Rebecca Alice Robinson Emma Jane Perkins Candace Milliken and Persis
Watson each with her hymn book had climbed the ladder leading to
the haymow a half hour before Abijah Flagg had heard the strains
of Daughters of Zion floating out to the road Rebecca being an
executive person had carried besides her hymn book a silver callbell
and pencil and paper An animated discussion regarding one of two
names for the society The Junior Heralds or The Daughters of Zion
had resulted in a unanimous vote for the latter and Rebecca had been
elected president at an early stage of the meeting She had modestly
suggested that Alice Robinson as the granddaughter of a missionary to
China would be much more eligible

No said Alice with entire good nature whoever is ELECTED
president you WILL be Rebeccayoure that kindso you might as well
have the honor Id just as lieves be secretary anyway

If you should want me to be treasurer I could be as well as not
said Persis Watson suggestively for you know my father keeps china
banks at his storeones that will hold as much as two dollars if you
will let them I think hed give us one if I happen to be treasurer

The three principal officers were thus elected at one fell swoop
and with an entire absence of that red tape which commonly renders
organization so tiresome Candace Milliken suggesting that perhaps shed
better be vicepresident as Emma Jane Perkins was always so bashful

We ought to have more members she reminded the other girls but if
we had invited them the first day theyd have all wanted to be officers
especially Minnie Smellie so its just as well not to ask them till
another time Is Thirza Meserve too little to join

I cant think why anybody named Meserve should have called a baby
Thirza said Rebecca somewhat out of order though the meeting was
carried on with small recognition of parliamentary laws It always
makes me want to say

 Thirza Meserver
 Heaven preserve her
 Thirza Meserver
 Do we deserve her

Shes little but shes sweet and absolutely without guile I think we
ought to have her

Is guile the same as guilt inquired Emma Jane Perkins

Yes the president answered exactly the same except one is written
and the other spoken language Rebecca was rather good at imbibing
information and a master hand at imparting it Written language is
for poems and graduations and occasions like thiskind of like a best
Sundaygotomeeting dress that you wouldnt like to go blueberrying in
for fear of getting it spotted

Id just as lieves get guile spotted as not affirmed the
unimaginative Emma Jane I think its an awful foolish word but now
were all named and our officers elected what do we do first Its
easy enough for Mary and Martha Burch they just play at missionarying
because their folks work at it same as Living and I used to make
believe be blacksmiths when we were little

It must be nicer missionarying in those foreign places said Persis
because on Africs shores and Indias plains and other spots where
Satan reigns thats fathers favorite hymn theres always a heathen
bowing down to wood and stone You can take away his idols if hell let
you and give him a bible and the beginnings all made But wholl we
begin on Jethro Small

Oh hes entirely too dirty and foolish besides exclaimed Candace
Why not Ethan Hunt He swears dreadfully

He lives on nuts and is a hermit and its a mile to his camp through
the thick woods my motherll never let me go there objected Alice
Theres Uncle Tut Judson

Hes too old hes most a hundred and deaf as a post complained Emma
Jane Besides his married daughter is a Sabbathschool teacherwhy
doesnt she teach him to behave I cant think of anybody just right to
start on

Dont talk like that Emma Jane and Rebeccas tone had a tinge of
reproof in it We are a copperated body named the Daughters of Zion
and of course weve got to find something to do Foreigners are the
easiest theres a Scotch family at North Riverboro an English one in
Edgewood and one Cuban man at Millkins Mills

Havent foreigners got any religion of their own inquired Persis
curiously

Yees I spose so kind of a one but foreigners religions are never
rightours is the only good one This was from Candace the deacons
daughter

I do think it must be dreadful being born with a religion and growing
up with it and then finding out its no use and all your time wasted
Here Rebecca sighed chewed a straw and looked troubled

Well thats your punishment for being a heathen retorted Candace
who had been brought up strictly

But I cant for the life of me see how you can help being a heathen if
youre born in Africa persisted Persis who was well named

You cant Rebecca was clear on this point I had that all out with
Mrs Burch when she was visiting Aunt Miranda She says they cant help
being heathen but if theres a single mission station in the whole of
Africa theyre accountable if they dont go there and get saved

Are there plenty of stages and railroads asked Alice because there
must be dreadfully long distances and what if they couldnt pay the
fare

That part of it is so dreadfully puzzly we mustnt talk about it
please said Rebecca her sensitive face quivering with the force of
the problem Poor little soul She did not realize that her superiors
in age and intellect had spent many a sleepless night over that same
accountability of the heathen

Its too bad the Simpsons have moved away said Candace Its so
seldom you can find a real big wicked family like that to save with
only Clara Belle and Susan good in it

And numbers count for so much continued Alice My grandmother says
if missionaries cant convert about so many in a year the Board advises
them to come back to America and take up some other work

I know Rebecca corroborated and its the same with revivalists At
the Centennial picnic at North Riverboro a revivalist sat opposite to
Mr Ladd and Aunt Jane and me and he was telling about his wonderful
success in Bangor last winter Hed converted a hundred and thirty in
a month he said or about four and a third a day I had just finished
fractions so I asked Mr Ladd how the third of a man could be
converted He laughed and said it was just the other way that the man
was a third converted Then he explained that if you were trying to
convince a person of his sin on a Monday and couldnt quite finish by
sundown perhaps you wouldnt want to sit up all night with him and
perhaps he wouldnt want you to so youd begin again on Tuesday and
you couldnt say just which day he was converted because it would be
two thirds on Monday and one third on Tuesday

Mr Ladd is always making fun and the Board couldnt expect any great
things of us girls new beginners suggested Emma Jane who was being
constantly warned against tautology by her teacher I think its awful
rude anyway to go right out and try to convert your neighbors but if
you borrow a horse and go to Edgewood Lower Corner or Millikens Mills
I spose that makes it Foreign Missions

Would we each go alone or wait upon them with a committee as they did
when they asked Deacon Tuttle for a contribution for the new hearse
asked Persis

Oh We must go alone decided Rebecca it would be much more refined
and delicate Aunt Miranda says that one man alone could never get
a subscription from Deacon Tuttle and thats the reason they sent a
committee But it seems to me Mrs Burch couldnt mean for us to try
and convert people when were none of us even church members except
Candace I think all we can do is to persuade them to go to meeting and
Sabbath school or give money for the hearse or the new horse sheds
Now lets all think quietly for a minute or two whos the very most
heathenish and reperrehensiblest person in Riverboro

After a very brief period of silence the words Jacob Moody fell from
all lips with entire accord

You are right said the president tersely and after singing hymn
number two hundred seventy four to be found on the sixtysixth page
we will take up the question of persuading Mr Moody to attend divine
service or the ministers Bible class he not having been in the
meetinghouse for lo these many years

 Daughter of Zion the power that hath saved thee
 Extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be

Sing without reading if you please omitting the second stanza Hymn
two seventy four to be found on the sixtysixth page of the new hymn
book or on page thirty two of Emma Jane Perkinss old one

II

It is doubtful if the Rev Mr Burch had ever found in Syria a person
more difficult to persuade than the already gospelhardened Jacob
Moody of Riverboro

Tall gaunt swarthy blackbeardedhis masses of grizzled uncombed
hair and the red scar across his nose and cheek added to his sinister
appearance His tumbledown house stood on a rocky bit of land back of
the Sawyer pasture and the acres of his farm stretched out on all sides
of it He lived alone ate alone plowed planted sowed harvested
alone and was more than willing to die alone unwept unhonored and
unsung The road that bordered upon his fields was comparatively little
used by any one and notwithstanding the fact that it was thickly set
with chokecherry trees and blackberry bushes it had been for years
practically deserted by the children Jacobs Red Astrakhan and Granny
Garland trees hung thick with apples but no Riverboro or Edgewood boy
stole them for terrifying accounts of the fate that had overtaken one
urchin in times agone had been handed along from boy to boy protecting
the Moody fruit far better than any police patrol

Perhaps no circumstances could have extenuated the old mans surly
manners or his lack of all citizenly graces and virtues but his
neighbors commonly rebuked his present way of living and forgot the
troubled past that had brought it about the sharptongued wife the
unloving and disloyal sons the daughters hapless fate and all the
other sorry tricks that fortune had played upon himat least that was
the way in which he had always regarded his disappointments and griefs

This then was the personage whose moral rehabilitation was to be
accomplished by the Daughters of Zion But how

Who will volunteer to visit Mr Moody blandly asked the president

VISIT MR MOODY It was a wonder the roof of the barn chamber did not
fall it did indeed echo the words and in some way make them sound more
grim and satirical

Nobodyll volunteer Rebecca Rowena Randall and you know it said
Emma Jane

Why dont we draw lots when none of us wants to speak to him and yet
one of us must

This suggestion fell from Persis Watson who had been pale and
thoughtful ever since the first mention of Jacob Moody She was fond of
Granny Garlands she had once met Jacob and as to what befell well
we all have our secret tragedies

Wouldnt it be wicked to settle it that way

Its gamblers that draw lots

People did it in the Bible ever so often

It doesnt seem nice for a missionary meeting

These remarks fell all together upon the presidents bewildered ear the
while as she always said in compositionsthe while she was trying
to adjust the ethics of this unexpected and difficult dilemma

It is a very puzzly question she said thoughtfully I could ask Aunt
Jane if we had time but I suppose we havent It doesnt seem nice to
draw lots and yet how can we settle it without We know we mean right
and perhaps it will be Alice take this paper and tear off five narrow
pieces all different lengths

At this moment a voice from a distance floated up to the haymowa voice
saying plaintively Will you let me play with you girls Huldah has
gone to ride and Im all alone

It was the voice of the absolutelywithoutguile Thirza Meserve and it
came at an opportune moment

If she is going to be a member said Persis why not let her come up
and hold the lots Shed be real honest and not favor anybody

It seemed an excellent idea and was followed up so quickly that
scarcely three minutes ensued before the guileless one was holding the
five scraps in her hot little palm laboriously changing their places
again and again until they looked exactly alike and all rather soiled
and wilted

Come girls draw commanded the president Thirza you mustnt chew
gum at a missionary meeting it isnt polite nor holy Take it out and
stick it somewhere till the exercises are over

The five Daughters of Zion approached the spot so charged with fate and
extended their trembling hands one by one Then after a moments silent
clutch of their papers they drew nearer to one another and compared
them

Emma Jane Perkins had drawn the short one becoming thus the destined
instrument for Jacob Moodys conversion to a more seemly manner of life

She looked about her despairingly as if to seek some painless and
respectable method of selfdestruction

Do lets draw over again she pleaded Im the worst of all of us
Im sure to make a mess of it till I kind o get trained in

Rebeccas heart sank at this frank confession which only corroborated
her own fears

Im sorry Emmy dear she said but our only excuse for drawing lots
at all would be to have it sacred We must think of it as a kind of a
sign almost like God speaking to Moses in the burning bush

Oh I WISH there was a burning bush right here cried the distracted
and recalcitrant missionary How quick Id step into it without even
stopping to take off my garnet ring

Dont be such a scarecat Emma Jane exclaimed Candace bracingly
Jacob Moody cant kill you even if he has an awful temper Trot right
along now before you get more frightened Shall we go cross lots with
her Rebecca and wait at the pasture gate Then whatever happens Alice
can put it down in the minutes of the meeting

In these terrible crises of life time gallops with such incredible
velocity that it seemed to Emma Jane only a breath before she was being
dragged through the fields by the other Daughters of Zion the guileless
little Thirza panting in the rear

At the entrance to the pasture Rebecca gave her an impassioned embrace
and whispering WHATEVER YOU DO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU LEAD UP lifted
off the top rail and pushed her through the bars Then the girls turned
their backs reluctantly on the pathetic figure and each sought a tree
under whose friendly shade she could watch and perhaps pray until the
missionary should return from her field of labor

Alice Robinson whose compositions were always marked 96 or 97100
symbolizing such perfection as could be attained in the mortal world of
RiverboroAlice not only Daughter but Scribe of Zion sharpened her
pencil and wrote a few wellchosen words of introduction to be used
when the records of the afternoon had been made by Emma Jane Perkins and
Jacob Moody

Rebeccas heart beat tumultuously under her gingham dress She felt
that a drama was being enacted and though unfortunately she was not the
central figure she had at least a modest part in it The short lot had
not fallen to the properest Daughter that she quite realized yet would
any one of them succeed in winning Jacob Moodys attention in
engaging him in pleasant conversation and finally in bringing him to
a realization of his mistaken way of life She doubted but at the same
moment her spirits rose at the thought of the difficulties involved in
the undertaking

Difficulties always spurred Rebecca on but they daunted poor Emma Jane
who had no little thrills of excitement and wonder and fear and longing
to sustain her lagging soul That her interview was to be entered as
minutes by a secretary seemed to her the last straw Her blue eyes
looked lighter than usual and had the glaze of china saucers her
usually pink cheeks were pale but she pressed on determined to be
a faithful Daughter of Zion and above all to be worthy of Rebeccas
admiration and respect

Rebecca can do anything she thought with enthusiastic loyalty and
I mustnt be any stupider than I can help or shell choose one of
the other girls for her most intimate friend So mustering all her
courage she turned into Jacob Moodys dooryard where he was chopping
wood

Its a pleasant afternoon Mr Moody she said in a polite but hoarse
whisper Rebeccas words LEAD UP LEAD UP ringing in clarion tones
through her brain

Jacob Moody looked at her curiously Good enough I guess he growled
but I dont never have time to look at afternoons

Emma Jane seated herself timorously on the end of a large log near the
chopping block supposing that Jacob like other hosts would pause in
his tasks and chat

The block is kind of like an idol she thought I wish I could take
it away from him and then perhaps hed talk

At this moment Jacob raised his axe and came down on the block with such
a stunning blow that Emma Jane fairly leaped into the air

Youd better look out Sissy or youll git chips in the eye said
Moody grimly going on with his work

The Daughter of Zion sent up a silent prayer for inspiration but none
came and she sat silent giving nervous jumps in spite of herself
whenever the axe fell upon the log Jacob was cutting

Finally the host became tired of his dumb visitor and leaning on
his axe he said Look here Sis what have you come for Whats your
errant Do you want apples Or cider Or what Speak out or GIT out
one or tother

Emma Jane who had wrung her handkerchief into a clammy ball gave it
a last despairing wrench and faltered Wouldnt you likehadnt you
betterdont you think youd ought to be more constant at meeting and
Sabbath school

Jacobs axe almost dropped from his nerveless hand and he regarded
the Daughter of Zion with unspeakable rage and disdain Then the blood
mounting in his face he gathered himself together and shouted You
take yourself off that log and out o this dooryard doublequick you
imperdent sanctomus young one You just let me ketch Bill Perkins
child trying to teach me where I shall go at my age Scuttle I tell
ye And if I see your pious cantin little mug inside my fence agin on
sech a business Ill chase ye down the hill or set the dog on ye SCOOT
I TELL YE

Emma Jane obeyed orders summarily taking herself off the log out the
dooryard and otherwise scuttling and scooting down the hill at a pace
never contemplated even by Jacob Moody who stood regarding her flying
heels with a sardonic grin

Down she stumbled the tears coursing over her cheeks and mingling with
the dust of her flight blighted hope shame fear rage all tearing
her bosom in turn till with a hysterical shriek she fell over the bars
and into Rebeccas arms outstretched to receive her The other Daughters
wiped her eyes and supported her almost fainting form while Thirza
thoroughly frightened burst into sympathetic tears and refused to be
comforted

No questions were asked for it was felt by all parties that Emma Janes
demeanor was answering them before they could be framed

He threatened to set the dog on me she wailed presently when as
they neared the Sawyer pasture she was able to control her voice He
called me a pious cantin young one and said hed chase me out o the
dooryard if I ever came again And hell tell my fatherI know he will
for he hates him like poison

All at once the adult point of view dawned upon Rebecca She never
saw it until it was too obvious to be ignored Had they done wrong in
interviewing Jacob Moody Would Aunt Miranda be angry as well as Mr
Perkins

Why was he so dreadful Emmy she questioned tenderly What did you
say first How did you lead up to it

Emma Jane sobbed more convulsively and wiped her nose and eyes
impartially as she tried to think

I guess I never led up at all not a mite I didnt know what you
meant I was sent on an errant and I went and done it the best I could
Emma Janes grammar always lapsed in moments of excitement And then
Jake roared at me like Squire Winships bull And he called my face
a mug You shut up that secretary book Alice Robinson If you write
down a single word Ill never speak to you again And I dont want to
be a member another minute for fear of drawing another short lot Ive
got enough of the Daughters or Zion to last me the rest o my life I
dont care who goes to meetin and who dont

The girls were at the Perkinss gate by this time and Emma Jane went
sadly into the empty house to remove all traces of the tragedy from her
person before her mother should come home from the church

The others wended their way slowly down the street feeling that their
promising missionary branch had died almost as soon as it had budded

Goodby said Rebecca swallowing lumps of disappointment and chagrin
as she saw the whole inspiring plan break and vanish into thin air like
an iridescent bubble Its all over and we wont ever try it again
Im going in to do overcasting as hard as I can because I hate that the
worst Aunt Jane must write to Mrs Burch that we dont want to be
home missionaries Perhaps were not big enough anyway Im perfectly
certain its nicer to convert people when theyre yellow or brown or
any color but white and I believe it must be easier to save their souls
than it is to make them go to meeting




Third Chronicle REBECCAS THOUGHT BOOK


I

The Sawyer girls barn still had its haymow in Rebeccas time
although the hay was a dozen years old or more and in the opinion of
the occasional visiting horse sadly juiceless and wanting in flavor
It still sheltered too old Deacon Israel Sawyers carryall and
mowingmachine with his pung his sleigh and a dozen other survivals
of an earlier era when the broad acres of the brick house went to make
one of the finest farms in Riverboro

There were no horses or cows in the stalls nowadays no pig grunting
comfortably of future spare ribs in the sty no hens to peck the plants
in the cherished garden patch The Sawyer girls were getting on in
years and mindful that care once killed a cat they ordered their
lives with the view of escaping that particular doom at least and
succeeded fairly well until Rebeccas advent made existence a trifle
more sensational

Once a month for years upon years Miss Miranda and Miss Jane had put
towels over their heads and made a solemn visit to the barn taking off
the enameled cloth coverings occasionally called emmanuel covers in
Riverboro dusting the ancient implements and sometimes sweeping
the heaviest of the cobwebs from the corners or giving a brush to the
floor

Deacon Israels tottering ladder still stood in its accustomed place
propped against the haymow and the heavenly stairway leading to eternal
glory scarcely looked fairer to Jacob of old than this to Rebecca By
means of its dusty rounds she mounted mounted mounted far away
from time and care and maiden aunts far away from childish tasks
and childish troubles to the barn chamber a place so full of golden
dreams happy reveries and vague longings that as her little brown
hands clung to the sides of the ladder and her feet trod the rounds
cautiously in her ascent her heart almost stopped beating in the sheer
joy of anticipation

Once having gained the heights the next thing was to unlatch the heavy
doors and give them a gentle swing outward Then oh ever new Paradise
Then oh ever lovely green and growing world For Rebecca had that
something in her soul that

Gives to seas and sunset skies The unspent beauty of surprise

At the top of Guide Board hill she could see Alice Robinsons barn with
its shining weather vane a huge burnished fish that swam with the wind
and foretold the day to all Riverboro The meadow with its sunny
slopes stretching up to the pine woods was sometimes a flowing sheet
of shimmering grass sometimeswhen daisies and buttercups were
bloominga vision of white and gold Sometimes the shorn stubble would
be dotted with the happy hills of hay and a little later the rock
maple on the edge of the pines would stand out like a golden ball
against the green its neighbor the sugar maple glowing beside it
brave in scarlet

It was on one of these autumn days with a wintry nip in the air that
Adam Ladd Rebeccas favorite Mr Aladdin after searching for her in
field and garden suddenly noticed the open doors of the barn chamber
and called to her At the sound of his vice she dropped her precious
diary and flew to the edge of the haymow He never forgot the vision
of the startled little poetess book in one mittened hand pencil in
the other dark hair all ruffled with the picturesque addition of an
occasional glade of straw her cheeks crimson her eyes shining

A Sappho in mittens he cried laughingly and at her eager question
told her to look up the unknown lady in the school encyclopedia when
she was admitted to the Female Seminary at Wareham

Now all being ready Rebecca went to a corner of the haymow and
withdrew a thick blankbook with mottled covers Out of her gingham
apron pocket came a pencil a bit of rubber and some pieces of brown
paper then she seated herself gravely on the floor and drew an
inverted soapbox nearer to her for a table

The book was reverently opened and there was a serious reading of the
extracts already carefully copied therein Most of them were apparently
to the writers liking for dimples of pleasure showed themselves now
and then and smiles of obvious delight played about her face but
once in a while there was a knitting of the brows and a sigh of
discouragement showing that the artist in the child was not wholly
satisfied

Then came the crucial moment when the budding author was supposedly to
be racked with the throes of composition but seemingly there were
no throes Other girls could wield the darning or crochet or knitting
needle and send the tatting shuttle through loops of the finest cotton
hemstitch oversew braid hair in thirteen strands but the pencil was
never obedient in their fingers and the pen and inkpot were a horror
from early childhood to the end of time

Not so with Rebecca her pencil moved as easily as her tongue and no
more striking simile could possibly be used Her handwriting was not
Spencerian she had neither time nor patience it is to be feared
for copybook methods and her unformed characters were frequently the
despair of her teachers but write she could write she would write she
must and did in season and out from the time she made pothooks at six
till now writing was the easiest of all possible tasks to be indulged
in as solace and balm when the terrors of examples in least common
multiple threatened to dethrone the reason or the rules of grammar
loomed huge and unconquerable in the near horizon

As to spelling it came to her in the main by free grace and not by
training and though she slipped at times from the beaten path her
extraordinary ear and good visual memory kept her from many or flagrant
mistakes It was her intention especially when saying her prayers at
night to look up all doubtful words in her small dictionary before
copying her Thoughts into the sacred book for the inspiration
of posterity but when genius burned with a brilliant flame and
particularly when she was in the barn and the dictionary in the house
impulse as usual carried the day

There sits Rebecca then in the open door of the Sawyers barn
chamberthe sunset door How many a time had her grandfather the good
deacon sat just underneath in his tippedback chair when Mrs Israels
temper was uncertain and the serenity of the barn was in comforting
contrast to his own fireside

The open doors swinging out to the peaceful landscape the solace of the
pipe not allowed in the settinroomhow beautifully these simple
agents have ministered to the family peace in days agone If I hadnt
had my barn and my store BOTH I couldnt never have lived in holy
matrimony with Maryliza once said Mr Watson feelingly

But the deacon looking on his waving grass fields his tasseling corn
and his timber lands bright and honest as were his eyes never saw
such visions as Rebecca The child transplanted from her home farm at
Sunnybrook from the care of the overworked but easygoing mother and
the companionship of the scantily fed scantily clothed happygolucky
brothers and sistersshe had indeed fallen on shady days in Riverboro
The blinds were closed in every room of the house but two and the same
might have been said of Miss Mirandas mind and heart though Miss
Jane had a few windows opening to the sun and Rebecca already had her
unconscious hand on several others Brickhouse rules were rigid and many
for a little creature so full of life but Rebeccas gay spirit could
not be pinioned in a strait jacket for long at a time it escaped
somehow and winged its merry way into the sunshine and free air if she
were not allowed to sing in the orchard like the wild bird she was she
could still sing in the cage like the canary

II

If you had opened the carefully guarded volume with the mottled covers
you would first have seen a wonderful title page constructed apparently
on the same lines as an obituary or the inscription on a tombstone
save for the quantity and variety of information contained in it Much
of the matter would seem to the captious critic better adapted to the
body of the book than to the title page but Rebecca was apparently
anxious that the principal personages in her chronicle should be well
described at the outset

She seems to have had a conviction that heredity plays its part in the
evolution of genius and her belief that the world will be inspired
by the possession of her Thoughts is too artless to be offensive She
evidently has respect for rich material confided to her teacher and
one can imagine Miss Dearborns woe had she been confronted by Rebeccas
chosen literary executor and bidden to deliver certain Valuable Poetry
and Thoughts the property of posterity unless carelessly destroyed

THOUGHT BOOK of Rebecca Rowena Randall Really of Sunnybrook Farm But
temporily of The Brick House Riverboro Own niece of Miss Miranda and
Jane Sawyer Second of seven children of her father Mr L D M Randall
Now at rest in Temperance cemmetary and there will be a monument as
soon as we pay off the mortgage on the farm Also of her mother Mrs
Aurelia Randall

 In case of Death the best of these Thoughts
 May be printed in my Remerniscences
 For the Sunday School Library at Temperance Maine
 Which needs more books fearfully
 And I hereby
 Will and Testament them to Mr Adam Ladd
 Who bought 300 cakes of soap from me
 And thus secured a premium
 A Greatly Needed Banquet Lamp
 For my friends the Simpsons
 He is the only one that incourages
 My writing Remerniscences and
 My teacher Miss Dearborn will
 Have much valuable Poetry and Thoughts
 To give him unless carelessly destroyed

 The pictures are by the same hand that
 Wrote the Thoughts

IT IS NOT NOW DECIDED WHETHER REBECCA ROWENA RANDALL WILL BE A PAINTER
OR AN AUTHOR BUT AFTER HER DEATH IT WILL BE KNOWN WHICH SHE HAS BEEN
IF ANY

FINIS

From the title page with its wealth of detail and its unnecessary and
irrelevant information the book ripples on like a brook and to the
weary reader of problem novels it may have something of the brooks
refreshing quality

OUR DIARIES May 187

All the girls are keeping a diary because Miss Dearborn was very much
ashamed when the school trustees told her that most of the girls and
all of the boys compositions were disgraceful and must be improved
upon next term She asked the boys to write letters to her once a week
instead of keeping a diary which they thought was girlish like playing
with dolls The boys thought it was dreadful to have to write letters
every seven days but she told them it was not half as bad for them as
it was for her who had to read them

To make my diary a little different I am going to call it a THOUGHT Book
written just like that with capitals I have thoughts that I never
can use unless I write them down for Aunt Miranda always says Keep
your thoughts to yourself Aunt Jane lets me tell her some but does not
like my queer ones and my true thoughts are mostly queer Emma Jane does
not mind hearing them now and then and that is my only chance

If Miss Dearborn does not like the name Thought Book I will call it
Remerniscences written just like that with a capital R Remerniscences
are things you remember about yourself and write down in case you should
die Aunt Jane doesnt like to read any other kind of books but just
lives of interesting dead people and she says that is what Longfellow
who was born in the state of Maine and we should be very proud of it
and try to write like him meant in his poem

 Lives of great men all remind us
 We should make our lives sublime
 And departing leave behind us
 Footprints on the sands of time

I know what this means because when Emma Jane and I went to the beach
with Uncle Jerry Cobb we ran along the wet sand and looked at the shapes
our boots made just as if they were stamped in wax Emma Jane turns in
her left foot splayfoot the boys call it which is not polite and Seth
Strout had just patched one of my shoes and it all came out in the sand
pictures When I learned The Psalm of Life for Friday afternoon speaking
I thought I shouldnt like to leave a patched footprint nor have Emma
Janes look crooked on the sands of time and right away I thought Oh
What a splendid thought for my Thought Book when Aunt Jane buys me a
fifteencent one over to Watsons store

    


REMERNISCENCES

June 187

I told Aunt Jane I was going to begin my Remerniscences and she says
I am full young but I reminded her that Candace Millikens sister died
when she was ten leaving no footprints whatever and if I should die
suddenly who would write down my Remerniscences Aunt Miranda says the
sun and moon would rise and set just the same and it was no matter if
they didnt get written down and to go up attic and find her piecebag
but I said it would as there was only one of everybody in the world
and nobody else could do their remerniscensing for them If I should die
tonight I know now who would describe me right Miss Dearborn would
say one thing and brother John another Emma Jane would try to do me
justice but has no words and I am glad Aunt Miranda never takes the
pen in hand

My dictionary is so small it has not many genteel words in it and I
cannot find how to spell Remerniscences but I remember from the cover
of Aunt Janes book that there was an s and a c close together in
the middle of it which I thought foolish and not needful

All the girls like their dairies very much but Minnie Smellie got Alice
Robinsons where she had hid it under the school wood pile and read
it all through She said it was no worse than reading anybodys
composition but we told her it was just like peeking through a keyhole
or listening at a window or opening a bureau drawer She said she
didnt look at it that way and I told her that unless her eyes got
unscealed she would never leave any kind of a sublime footprint on
the sands of time I told her a diary was very sacred as you generally
poured your deepest feelings into it expecting nobody to look at it but
yourself and your indulgent heavenly Father who seeeth all things

Of course it would not hurt Persis Watson to show her diary because she
has not a sacred plan and this is the way it goes for she reads it out
loud to us

Arose at six this morningyou always arise in a diary but you say
get up when you talk about it Ate breakfast at half past six Had soda
biscuits coffee fish hash and doughnuts Wiped the dishes fed the
hens and made my bed before school Had a good arithmetic lesson but
went down two in spelling At half past four played hide and coop in the
Sawyer pasture Fed hens and went to bed at eight

She says she cant put in what doesnt happen but as I dont think her
diary is interesting she will ask her mother to have meat hash instead
of fish with pie when the doughnuts give out and she will feed the
hens before breakfast to make a change We are all going now to try and
make something happen every single day so the diaries wont be so dull
and the footprints so common

    


AN UNCOMMON THOUGHT

July 187

We dug up our rosecakes today and that gave me a good Remerniscence
The way you make rose cakes is you take the leaves of full blown roses
and mix them with a little cinnamon and as much brown sugar as they
will give you which is never half enough except Persis Watson whose
affectionate parents let her go to the barrel in their store Then you
do up little bits like sedlitz powders first in soft paper and then
in brown and bury them in the ground and let them stay as long as you
possibly can hold out then dig them up and eat them Emma Jane and
I stick up little signs over the holes in the ground with the date we
buried them and when theyll be done enough to dig up but we can never
wait When Aunt Jane saw us she said it was the first thing for children
to learnnot to be impatientso when I went to the barn chamber I
made a poem

IMPATIENCE

We dug our rose cakes up oh all too soon Twas in the orchard just at
noon Twas in a bright July forenoon Twas in the sunny afternoon Twas
underneath the harvest moon

It was not that way at all it was a foggy morning before school and I
should think poets could never possibly get to heaven for it is so hard
to stick to the truth when you are writing poetry Emma Jane thinks it
is nobodys business when we dug the rosecakes up I like the line about
the harvest moon best but it would give a wrong idea of our lives and
characters to the people that read my Thoughts for they would think we
were up late nights so I have fixed it like this

 IMPATIENCE

 We dug our rose cakes up oh all too soon
 We thought their sweetness would be such a boon
 We neer suspicioned they would not be done
 After three days of autumn wind and sun
 Why did we from the earth our treasures draw
 Twas not for fear that rat or mole might naw
 An aged aunt doth say impatience was the reason
 She says that youth is ever out of season

That is just as Aunt Jane said it and it gave me the thought for the
poem which is rather uncommon

    


A DREADFUL QUESTION

September 187

WHICH HAS BEEN THE MOST BENEFERCENT INFLUENCE ON CHARACTERPUNISHMENT
OR REWARD

This truly dreadful question was given us by Dr Moses when he visited
school today He is a School Committee not a whole one but I do not
know the singular number of him He told us we could ask our families
what they thought though he would rather we wouldnt but we must write
our own words and he would hear them next week

After he went out and shut the door the scholars were all plunged in
gloom and you could have heard a pin drop Alice Robinson cried and
borrowed my handkerchief and the boys looked as if the schoolhouse had
been struck by lightning The worst of all was poor Miss Dearborn who
will lose her place if she does not make us better scholars soon for
Dr Moses has a daughter all ready to put right in to the school and she
can board at home and save all her wages Libby Moses is her name

Miss Dearborn stared out the window and her mouth and chin shook like
Alice Robinsons for she knew ah all to well what the coming week
would bring forth

Then I raised my hand for permission to speak and stood up and said
Miss Dearborn dont you mind Just explain to us what benefercent
means and well write something real interesting for all of us know
what punishment is and have seen others get rewards and it is not so
bad a subject as some And Dick Carter whispered GOOD ON YOUR HEAD
REBECCA which mean he was sorry for her too and would try his best
but has no words

Then teacher smiled and said benefercent meant good or healthy for
anybody and would all rise who thought punishment made the best
scholars and men and women and everybody sat stock still

And then she asked all to stand who believed that rewards produced the
finest results and there was a mighty sound like unto the rushing of
waters but really was our feet scraping the floor and the scholars
stood up and it looked like an army though it was only nineteen
because of the strong belief that was in them Then Miss Dearborn
laughed and said she was thankful for every whipping she had when
she was a child and Living Perkins said perhaps we hadnt got to the
thankful age or perhaps her father hadnt used a strap and she said
oh no it was her mother with the open hand and Dick Carter said he
wouldnt call that punishment and Sam Simpson said so too

I am going to write about the subject in my Thought Book first and when
I make it into a composition I can leave out anything about the family
or not genteel as there is much to relate about punishment not pleasant
or nice and hardly polite

            

PUNISHMENT

Punishment is a very puzzly thing but I believe in it when really
deserved only when I punish myself it does not always turn out well
When I leaned over the new bridge and got my dress all paint and Aunt
Sarah Cobb couldnt get it out I had to wear it spotted for six
months which hurt my pride but was right I stayed at home from Alice
Robinsons birthday party for a punishment and went to the circus
next day instead but Alices parties are very cold and stiff as Mrs
Robinson makes the boys stand on newspapers if they come inside the
door and the blinds are always shut and Mrs Robinson tells me how bad
her liver complaint is this year So I thought to pay for the circus
and a few other things I ought to get more punishment and I threw my
pink parasol down the well as the mothers in the missionary books throw
their infants to the crocodiles in the Ganges river But it got stuck
in the chain that holds the bucket and Aunt Miranda had to get Abijah
Flagg to take out all the broken bits before we could ring up water

I punished myself this way because Aunt Miranda said that unless I
improved I would be nothing but a Burden and a Blight

There was an old man used to go by our farm carrying a lot of broken
chairs to bottom and mother used to sayPoor man His back is too
weak for such a burden and I used to take him out a doughnut and this
is the part I want to go into the Remerniscences Once I told him we
were sorry the chairs were so heavy and he said THEY DIDNT SEEM SO
HEAVY WHEN HE HAD ET THE DOUGHNUT This does not mean that the doughnut
was heavier than the chairs which is what brother John said but it is a
beautiful thought and shows how the human race should have sympathy and
help bear burdens

I know about a Blight for there was a dreadful east wind over at our
farm that destroyed all the little young crops just out of the ground
and the farmers called it the Blight And I would rather be hail sleet
frost or snow than a Blight which is mean and secret and which is the
reason I threw away the dearest thing on earth to me the pink parasol
that Miss Ross brought me from Paris France I have also wrapped up my
bead purse in three papers and put it away marked not to be opened till
after my death unless needed for a party

I must not be Burden I must not be Blight The angels in heaven would
weep at the sight

     

REWARDS

A good way to find out which has the most benefercent effect would be to
try rewards on myself this next week and write my composition the very
last day when I see how my character is It is hard to find rewards for
yourself but perhaps Aunt Jane and some of the girls would each give
me one to help out I could carry my bead purse to school every day
or wear my coral chain a little while before I go to sleep at night I
could read Cora or the Sorrows of a Doctors Wife a little oftener but
thats all the rewards I can think of I fear Aunt Miranda would say
they are wicked but oh if they should turn out benefercent how glad and
joyful life would be to me A sweet and beautiful character beloved
by my teacher and schoolmates admired and petted by my aunts and
neighbors yet carrying my bead purse constantly with perhaps my best
hat on Wednesday afternoons as well as Sundays

    

A GREAT SHOCK

The reason why Alice Robinson could not play was she was being punished
for breaking her mothers blue platter Just before supper my story
being finished I went up Guide Board hill to see how she was bearing
up and she spoke to me from her window She said she did not mind being
punished because she hadnt been for a long time and she hoped it would
help her with her composition She thought it would give her thoughts
and tomorrows the last day for her to have any This gave me a good
idea and I told her to call her father up and beg him to beat her
violently It would hurt I said but perhaps none of the other girls
would have a punishment like that and her composition would be all
different and splendid I would borrow Aunt Mirandas witchhayzel and
pour it on her wounds like the Samaritan in the Bible

I went up again after supper with Dick Carter to see how it turned out
Alice came to the window and Dick threw up a note tied to a stick I
had written DEMAND YOUR PUNISHMENT TO THE FULL BE BRAVE LIKE DOLORES
MOTHER IN THE Martyrs of Spain

She threw down an answer and it was YOU JUST BE LIKE DOLORES MOTHER
YOURSELF IF YOURE SO SMART Then she stamped away from the window and
my feelings were hurt but Dick said perhaps she was hungry and that
made her cross And as Dick and I turned to go out of the yard we looked
back and I saw something I can never forget The Great Shock Mrs
Robinson was out behind the barn feeding the turkies Mr Robinson
came softly out of the side door in the orchard and looking everywheres
around he stepped to the wire closet and took out a saucer of cold beans
with a pickled beet on top and a big piece of blueberry pie Then he
crept up the back stairs and we could see Alice open her door and take
in the supper

Oh What will become of her composition and how can she tell anything
of the benefercent effects of punishment when she is locked up by
one parent and fed by the other I have forgiven her for the way she
snapped me up for of course you couldnt beg your father to beat you
when he was bringing you blueberry pie Mrs Robinson makes a kind that
leaks out a thick purple juice into the plate and needs a spoon and
blacks your mouth but is heavenly

    

A DREAM

The week is almost up and very soon Dr Moses will drive up to the
school house like Elijah in the chariot and come in to hear us read
There is a good deal of sickness among us Some of the boys are not able
to come to school just now but hope to be about again by Monday when
Dr Moses goes away to a convention It is a very hard composition to
write somehow Last night I dreamed that the river was ink and I kept
dipping into it and writing with a penstalk made of a young pine tree I
sliced great slabs of marble off the side of one of the White Mountains
the one you see when going to meeting and wrote on those Then I threw
them all into the falls not being good enough for Dr Moses

Dick Carter had a splendid boy to stay over Sunday He makes the real
newspaper named The Pilot published by the boys at Wareham Academy He
says when he talks about himself in writing he calls himself we and
it sounds much more like print besides conscealing him more

Example Our hair was measured this morning and has grown two inches
since last time We have a loose tooth that troubles us very much
Our inkspot that we made by negligence on our only white petticoat we
have been able to remove with lemon and milk Some of our petticoat came
out with the spot

I shall try it in my composition sometime for of course I shall write
for the Pilot when I go to Wareham Seminary Uncle Jerry Cobb says that
I shall and thinks that in four years I might rise to be editor if they
ever have girls

I have never been more good than since I have been rewarding myself
steady even to asking Aunt Miranda kindly to offer me a company jelly
tart not because I was hungry but for an experement I was trying and
would explain to her sometime

She said she never thought it was wise to experement with your stomach
and I said with a queer thrilling look it was not my stomach but my
soul that was being tried Then she gave me the tart and walked away
all puzzled and nervous

The new minister has asked me to come and see him any Saturday afternoon
as he writes poetry himself but I would rather not ask him about this
composition

Ministers never believe in rewards and it is useless to hope that they
will We had the wrath of God four times in sermons this last summer
but God cannot be angry all the timenobody could especially in
summer Mr Baxter is different and calls his wife dear which is lovely
and the first time I ever heard it in Riverboro Mrs Baxter is another
kind of people too from those that live in Temperance I like to
watch her in meeting and see her listen to her husband who is young and
handsome for a minister it gives me very queer and uncommon feelings
when they look at each other which they always do when not otherwise
engaged

She has different clothes from anybody else Aunt Miranda says you must
think only of two things will your dress keep you warm and will it wear
well and there is nobody in the world to know how I love pink and red
and how I hate drab and green and how I never wear my hat with the
black and yellow porkupine quills without wishing it would blow into the
river

Wheneer I take my walks abroad How many quills I see But as they are
not porkupines They never come to me


COMPOSITION

WHICH HAS THE MOST BENEFERCENT EFFECT ON THE CHARACTER PUNISHMENT OR
REWARD

By Rebecca Rowena Randall

This copy not corrected by Miss Dearborn yet

We find ourselves very puzzled in approaching this truly great and
national question though we have tried very ernestly to understand it
so as to show how wisely and wonderfully our dear teacher guides the
youthful mind it being her wish that our composition class shall long
be remembered in Riverboro Centre

We would say first of all that punishment seems more benefercently
needed by boys than girls Boys sins are very violent like stealing
fruit profane language playing truant fighting breaking windows and
killing innocent little flies and bugs If these were not taken out of
them early in life it would be impossible for them to become like our
martyred president Abraham Lincoln

Although we have asked everybody on our street they think boys sins
can only be whipped out of them with a switch or strap which makes
us feel very sad as boys when not sinning the dreadful sins mentioned
above seem just as good as girls and never cry when switched and say
it does not hurt much

We now approach girls which we know better being one Girls seem
better than boys because their sins are not so noisy and showy They
can disobey their parents and aunts whisper in silent hour cheat in
lessons say angry things to their schoolmates tell lies be sulky and
lazy but all these can be conducted quite ladylike and genteel and
nobody wants to strap girls because their skins are tender and get black
and blue very easily

Punishments make one very unhappy and rewards very happy and one would
think when one is happy one would behave the best We were acquainted
with a girl who gave herself rewards every day for a week and it seemed
to make her as lovely a character as one could wish but perhaps if one
went on for years giving rewards to onesself one would become selfish
One cannot tell one can only fear

If a dog kills a sheep we should whip him straight away and on the very
spot where he can see the sheep or he will not know what we mean and
may forget and kill another The same is true of the human race We must
be firm and patient in punishing no matter how much we love the one who
has done wrong and how hungry she is It does no good to whip a person
with one hand and offer her a pickled beet with the other This confuses
her mind and she may grow up not knowing right from wrong The
striking example of the pickled beet was removed from the essay by the
refined but ruthless Miss Dearborn who strove patiently but vainly to
keep such vulgar images out of her pupils literary efforts

We now respectfully approach the Holy Bible and the people in the Bible
were punished the whole time and that would seem to make it right
Everybody says Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth but we think ourself
that the Lord is a better punisher than we are and knows better how and
when to do it having attended to it ever since the year BC while
the human race could not know about it till 1492 AD which is when
Columbus discovered America

We do not believe we can find out all about this truly great and
national subject till we get to heaven where the human race strapped
and unstrapped if any can meet together and laying down their harps
discuss how they got there

And we would gently advise boys to be more quiet and genteel in conduct
and try rewards to see how they would work Rewards are not all like
the little rosebud merit cards we receive on Fridays and which boys
sometimes tear up and fling scornfully to the breeze when they get
outside but girls preserve carefully in an envelope

Some rewards are great and glorious for boys can get to be governor or
school trustee or road commissioner or president while girls can only
be wife and mother But all of us can have the ornament of a meek and
lowly spirit especially girls who have more use for it than boys

STORIES AND PEOPLE

October 187

There are people in books and people in Riverboro and they are not the
same kind They never talk of chargers and palfreys in the village nor
say How oft and Methinks and if a Scotchman out of Rob Roy should come
to Riverboro and want to marry one of us girls we could not understand
him unless he made motions though Huldah Meserve says if a nobleman of
high degree should ask her to be hisone of vast estates with serfs at
his biddingshe would be able to guess his meaning in any language

Uncle Jerry Cobb thinks that Riverboro people would not make a story
but I know that some of them would

Jackolantern though only a baby was just like a real story if
anybody had written a piece about him How his mother was dead and his
father ran away and Emma Jane and I got Aunt Sarah Cobb to keep him so
Mr Perkins wouldnt take him to the poor farm and about our lovely
times with him that summer and our dreadful loss when his father
remembered him in the fall and came to take him away and how Aunt Sarah
carried the trundle bed up attic again and Emma Jane and I heard her
crying and stole away

Mrs Peter Meserve says Grandpa Sawyer was a wonderful hand at stories
before his spirit was broken by grandmother She says he was the life
of the store and tavern when he was a young man though generally sober
and she thinks I take after him because I like compositions better than
all the other lessons but mother says I take after father who always
could say everything nicely whether he had anything to say or not so
methinks I should be grateful to both of them They are what is called
ancestors and much depends upon whether you have them or not The
Simpsons have not any at all Aunt Miranda says the reason everybody
is so prosperous around here is because their ancestors were all first
settlers and raised on burnt ground This should make us very proud

Methinks and methought are splendid words for compositions Miss
Dearborn likes them very much but Alice and I never bring them in to
suit her Methought means the same as I thought but sounds better
Example If you are telling a dream you had about your aged aunt

 Methought I heard her say
 My child you have so useful been
 You need not sew today

This is a good example one way but too unlikely woe is me

This afternoon I was walking over to the store to buy molasses and as
I came off the bridge and turned up the hill I saw lots and lots of
heelprints in the side of the road heelprints with little spike holes
in them

Oh The river drivers have come from up country I thought and
theyll be breaking the jam at our falls tomorrow I looked everywhere
about and not a man did I see but still I knew I was not mistaken for
the heelprints could not lie All the way over and back I thought about
it though unfortunately forgetting the molasses and Alice Robinson
not being able to come out I took playtime to write a story It is
the first grownup one I ever did and is intended to be like Cora the
Doctors Wife not like a school composition It is written for Mr Adam
Ladd and people like him who live in Boston and is the printed kind
you get money for to pay off a mortgage

    

LANCELOT OR THE PARTED LOVERS

A beautiful village maiden was betrothed to a stallwart river driver
but they had high and bitter words and parted he to weep into the
crystal stream as he drove his logs and she to sigh and moan as she
went about her round of household tasks

At eventide the maiden was wont to lean over the bridge and her tears
also fell into the foaming stream so though the two unhappy lovers did
not know it the river was their friend the only one to whom they told
their secrets and wept into

The months crept on and it was the next July when the maiden was passing
over the bridge and up the hill Suddenly she spied footprints on the
sands of time

The river drivers have come again she cried putting her hand to
her side for she had a slight heart trouble like Cora and Mrs Peter
Meserve that doesnt kill

They HAVE come indeed ESPECIALLY ONE YOU KNOW said a voice and
out from the alder bushes sprung Lancelot Littlefield for that was the
lovers name and it was none other than he His hair was curly and like
living gold His shirt white of flannel was new and dry and of a
handsome color and as the maiden looked at him she could think of
nought but a fairy prince

Forgive she mermered stretching out her waisted hands

Nay sweet he replied Tis I should say that to you and bending
gracefully on one knee he kissed the hem of her dress It was a rich
pink gingham check ellaborately ornamented with white tape trimming

Clasping each other to the heart like Cora and the Doctor they stood
there for a long while till they heard the rumble of wheels on the
bridge and knew they must disentangle

The wheels came nearer and verily it was the maidens father

Can I wed with your fair daughter this very moon asked Lancelot who
will not be called his whole name again in this story

You may said the father for lo she has been ready and waiting for
many months This he said not noting how he was shaming the maiden
whose name was Linda Rowenetta

Then and there the nuptial day was appointed and when it came the
marriage knot was tied upon the river bank where first they met the
river bank where they had parted in anger and where they had again
scealeld their vows and clasped each other to the heart And it was very
low water that summer and the river always thought it was because no
tears dropped into it but so many smiles that like sunshine they dried
it up

Long ago when I used to watch Miss Ross painting the old mill at
Sunnybrook I thought I would be a painter for Miss Ross went to Paris
France where she bought my bead purse and pink parasol and I thought
I would like to see a street with beautiful brightcolored things
sparkling and hanging in the store windows

Then when the missionaries from Syria came to stay at the brick house
Mrs Burch said that after I had experienced religion I must learn music
and train my voice and go out to heathen lands and save souls so I
thought that would be my career But we girls tried to have a branch and
be home missionaries and it did not work well Emma Janes father would
not let her have her birthday party when he found out what she had done
and Aunt Jane sent me up to Jake Moodys to tell him we did not mean
to be rude when we asked him to go to meeting more often He said all
right but just let him catch that little doughfaced Perkins young one
in his yard once more and shed have reason to remember the call which
was just as rude and impolite as our trying to lead him to a purer and a
better life

Then Uncle Jerry and Mr Aladdin and Miss Dearborn liked my
compositions and I thought Id better be a writer for I must be
something the minute Im seventeen or how shall we ever get the
mortgage off the farm But even that hope is taken away from me now
for Uncle Jerry made fun of my story Lancelot Or The Parted Lovers and I
have decided to be a teacher like Miss Dearborn

The pathetic announcement of a change in the career and life purposes of
Rebecca was brought about by her reading the grownup story to Mr and
Mrs Jeremiah Cobb after supper in the orchard Uncle Jerry was the
person who had maintained all along that Riverboro people would not make
a story and Lancelot or The Parted Lovers was intended to refute that
assertion at once and forever an assertion which Rebecca regarded
quite truly as untenable though why she certainly never could have
explained Unfortunately Lancelot was a poor missionary quite unfitted
for the high achievements to which he was destined by the youthful
novelist and Uncle Jerry though a stagedriver and no reading man at
once perceived the flabbiness and transparency of the Parted Lovers the
moment they were held up to his inspection

You see Riverboro people WILL make a story asserted Rebecca
triumphantly as she finished her reading and folded the paper And it
all came from my noticing the river drivers tracks by the roadside and
wondering about them and wondering always makes stories the minister
says so

Yees allowed Uncle Jerry reflectively tipping his chair back
against the apple tree and forcing his slow mind to violent and
instantaneous action for Rebecca was his pride and joy a person in
his opinion of superhuman talent one therefore to be whittled into
shape if occasion demanded

Its a Riverboro story sure enough because youve got the river
and the bridge and the hill and the drivers all right there in it but
theres something awful queer bout it the folks dont act Riverboro
and dont talk Riverboro cordin to my notions I call it a reglar
book story

But objected Rebecca the people in Cinderella didnt act like us
and you thought that was a beautiful story when I told it to you

I know replied Uncle Jerry gaining eloquence in the heat of
argument They didnt act like us but t any rate they acted like
emselves Somehow they was all of a piece Cinderella was a little too
good mebbe and the sisters was most too thunderin bad to live on the
face o the earth and that fayry old lady that kep the punkin coach
up her sleevewell anyhow you jest believe that punkin coach rats
mice and all when youre hearin bout it fore ever you stop to think
it aint so

I don know how tis but the folks in that Cinderella story seem to
match together somehow theyre all powful onlikelythe prince feller
with the glass slipper and the hull bunch but jest the same you kind
o gulp em all down in a lump But land Rebecky nobodyd swaller that
there village maiden o yourn and as for whatshisname Littlefield
that come out o them bushes such a feller never d a ben IN bushes
No Rebecky youre the smartest little critter there is in this
township and you beat your Uncle Jerry all holler when it comes to
usin a lead pencil but I say that aint no true Riverboro story Look
at the way they talk What was that bout being BETROTHED

Betrothed is a genteel word for engaged to be married explained the
crushed and chastened author and it was fortunate the doting old man
did not notice her eyes in the twilight or he might have known that
tears were not far away

Well thats all right then Im as ignorant as Coopers cow when
it comes to the dictionary How about whatshisname callin the girl
Naysweet

I thought myself that sounded foolish confessed Rebecca but its
what the Doctor calls Cora when he tries to persuade her not to quarrel
with his mother who comes to live with them I know they dont say it in
Riverboro or Temperance but I thought perhaps it was Boston talk

Well it aint asserted Mr Cobb decisively Ive druv Boston men
up in the stage from Milltown manys the time and none of em ever
said Naysweet to me nor nothinlike it They talked like folks every
mothers son of em If Id a had that whatshisname on the harricane
deck o the stage and he tried any naysweetin on me Id a pitched
him into the cornfield side o the road I guess you aint growed up
enough for that kind of a story Rebecky for your poetry cant be beat
in York County thats sure and your compositions are good enough to
read out loud in town meetin any day

Rebecca brightened up a little and bade the old couple her usual
affectionate good night but she descended the hill in a saddened mood
When she reached the bridge the sun a ball of red fire was setting
behind Squire Beans woods As she looked it shone full on the broad
still bosom of the river and for one perfect instant the trees on the
shores were reflected all swimming in a sea of pink Leaning over the
rail she watched the light fade from crimson to carmine from carmine
to rose from rose to amber and from amber to gray Then withdrawing
Lancelot or the Parted Lovers from her apron pocket she tore the pages
into bits and dropped them into the water below with a sigh

Uncle Jerry never said a word about the ending she thought and that
was so nice

And she was right but while Uncle Jerry was an illuminating critic when
it came to the actions and language of his Riverboro neighbors he had
no power to direct the young mariner when she followed the gleam and
used her imagination

OUR SECRET SOCIETY

November 187

Our Secret society has just had a splendid picnic in Candace Millikens
barn

Our name is the BOSS and not a single boy in the village has been
able to guess it It means Braid Over Shoulder Society and that is the
sign All the members wear one of their braids over the right shoulder
in front the presidents tied with red ribbon I am the president and
all the rest tied with blue

To attract the attention of another member when in company or at a
public place we take the braid between the thumb and little finger and
stand carelessly on one leg This is the Secret Signal and the password
is Sobb BOSS spelled backwards which was my idea and is thought
rather uncommon

One of the rules of the BOSS is that any member may be required to
tell her besetting sin at any meeting if asked to do so by a majority
of the members

This was Candace Millikens idea and much opposed by everybody but when
it came to a vote so many of the girls were afraid of offending Candace
that they agreed because there was nobody elses father and mother
who would let us picnic in their barn and use their plow harrow
grindstone sleigh carryall pung sled and wheelbarrow which we did
and injured hardly anything

They asked me to tell my besetting sin at the very first meeting and it
nearly killed me to do it because it is such a common greedy one It is
that I cant bear to call the other girls when I have found a thick spot
when we are out berrying in the summer time

After I confessed which made me dreadfully ashamed every one of the
girls seemed surprised and said they had never noticed that one but had
each thought of something very different that I would be sure to think
was my besetting sin Then Emma Jane said that rather than tell hers she
would resign from the Society and miss the picnic So it made so
much trouble that Candace gave up We struck out the rule from the
constitution and I had told my sin for nothing

The reason we named ourselves the BOSS is that Minnie Smellie has
had her head shaved after scarlet fever and has no braid so she cant
be a member

I dont want her for a member but I cant be happy thinking she will
feel slighted and it takes away half the pleasure of belonging to the
Society myself and being president

That I think is the principal trouble about doing mean and unkind
things that you cant do wrong and feel right or be bad and feel good
If you only could you could do anything that came into your mind yet
always be happy

Minnie Smellie spoils everything she comes into but I suppose we
other girls must either have our hair shaved and call ourselves The
Baldheadians or let her be some kind of a special officer in the
BOSS

She might be the BITUD member Braid in the Upper Drawer for
there is where Mrs Smellie keeps it now that it is cut off

WINTER THOUGHTS

March 187

It is not such a cold day for March and I am up in the barn chamber with
my coat and hood on and Aunt Janes waterproof and my mittens

After I do three pages I am going to hide away this book in the haymow
till spring

Perhaps they get made into icicles on the way but I do not seem to have
any thoughts in the winter time The barn chamber is full of thoughts in
warm weather The sky gives them to me and the trees and flowers and
the birds and the river but now it is always gray and nipping the
branches are bare and the river is frozen

It is too cold to write in my bedroom but while we still kept an open
fire I had a few thoughts but now there is an airtight stove in the
dining room where we sit and we seem so close together Aunt Miranda
Aunt Jane and I that I dont like to write in my book for fear they will
ask me to read out loud my secret thoughts

I have just read over the first part of my Thought Book and I have
outgrown it all just exactly as I have outgrown my last years drab
cashmere

It is very queer how anybody can change so fast in a few months but I
remember that Emma Janes cat had kittens the day my book was bought at
Watsons store Mrs Perkins kept the prettiest white one Abijah Flagg
drowning all the others

It seems strange to me that cats will go on having kittens when they
know what becomes of them We were very sad about it but Mrs Perkins
said it was the way of the world and how things had to be

I cannot help being glad that they do not do the same with children or
John and Jenny Mira Mark and me would all have had stones tied to our
necks and been dropped into the deepest part of Sunny Brook for Hannah
and Fanny are the only truly handsome ones in the family

Mrs Perkins says I dress up well but never being dressed up it does
not matter much At least they didnt wait to dress up the kittens to
see how they would improve before drowning them but decided right
away

Emma Janes kitten that was born the same day this book was is now quite
an old cat who knows the way of the world herself and how things have
to be for she has had one batch of kittens drowned already

So perhaps it is not strange that my Thought Book seems so babyish and
foolish to me when I think of all I have gone through and the millions
of things I have learned and how much better I spell than I did ten
months ago

My fingers are cold through the mittens so goodbye dear Thought Book
friend of my childhood now so far far behind me

I will hide you in the haymow where youll be warm and cosy all the long
winter and where nobody can find you again in the summer time but your
affectionate author

Rebecca Rowena Randall




Fourth Chronicle A TRAGEDY IN MILLINERY


I

Emma Jane Perkinss new winter dress was a blue and green Scotch plaid
poplin trimmed with narrow green velvetribbon and steel nailheads
She had a gray jacket of thick furry cloth with large steel buttons
up the front a pair of green kid gloves and a gray felt hat with an
encircling band of bright green feathers The band began in front with
a birds head and ended behind with a birds tail and angels could have
desired no more beautiful toilette That was her opinion and it was
shared to the full by Rebecca

But Emma Jane as Rebecca had once described her to Mr Adam Ladd was
a rich blacksmiths daughter and she Rebecca was a little halforphan
from a mortgaged farm up Temperance way dependent upon her spinster
aunts for board clothes and schooling Scotch plaid poplins were
manifestly not for her but darkcolored woolen stuffs were and
mittens and last winters coats and furs

And how about hats Was there hope in store for her there she wondered
as she walked home from the Perkins house full of admiration for Emma
Janes winter outfit and loyally trying to keep that admiration free
from wicked envy Her redwinged black hat was her second best and
although it was shabby she still liked it but it would never do for
church even in Aunt Mirandas strange and nevertobecomprehended
views of suitable raiment

There was a brown felt turban in existence if one could call it
existence when it had been rained on snowed on and hailed on for two
seasons but the trimmings had at any rate perished quite off the face
of the earth that was one comfort

Emma Jane had said rather indiscreetly that at the village milliners
at Millikens Mills there was a perfectly elegant pink breast to be had
a breast that began in a perfectly elegant solferino and terminated in a
perfectly elegant magenta two colors much in vogue at that time If
the old brown hat was to be her portion yet another winter would Aunt
Miranda conceal its deficiencies from a carping world beneath the shaded
solferino breast WOULD she that was the question

Filled with these perplexing thoughts Rebecca entered the brick house
hung up her hood in the entry and went into the diningroom

Miss Jane was not there but Aunt Miranda sat by the window with her lap
full of sewing things and a chair piled with pasteboard boxes by her
side In one hand was the ancient battered brown felt turban and in
the other were the orange and black porcupine quills from Rebeccas last
summers hat from the hat of the summer before that and the summer
before that and so on back to prehistoric ages of which her childish
memory kept no specific record though she was sure that Temperance and
Riverboro society did Truly a sight to chill the blood of any eager
young dreamer who had been looking at gayer plumage

Miss Sawyer glanced up for a second with a satisfied expression and then
bent her eyes again upon her work

If I was going to buy a hat trimming she said I couldnt select
anything better or more economical than these quills Your mother had
them when she was married and you wore them the day you come to the
brick house from the farm and I said to myself then that they looked
kind of outlandish but Ive grown to like em now Ive got used to em
Youve been here for goin on two years and theyve hardly ben out
owear summer or winter moren a month to a time I declare they do
beat all for service It dont seem as if your mother could a chose
emAurelia was always such a poor buyer The black spills are bout
as good as new but the orange ones are gittin a little mite faded and
shabby I wonder if I couldnt dip all of em in shoe blackin It seems
real queer to put a porcupine into hat trimmin though I declare I
dont know jest what the animiles are like its ben so long sence
I looked at the pictures of em in a geography I always thought their
quills stood out straight and angry but these kind o curls round some
at the ends and that makes em stand the wind better How do you like
em on the brown felt she asked inclining her head in a discriminating
attitude and poising them awkwardly on the hat with her workstained
hand

How did she like them on the brown felt indeed

Miss Sawyer had not been looking at Rebecca but the childs eyes were
flashing her bosom heaving and her cheeks glowing with sudden rage
and despair All at once something happened She forgot that she was
speaking to an older person forgot that she was dependent forgot
everything but her disappointment at losing the solferino breast
remembering nothing but the enchanting dazzling beauty of Emma Jane
Perkinss winter outfit and suddenly quite without warning she burst
into a torrent of protest

I will NOT wear those hateful porcupine quills again this winter I
will not Its wicked WICKED to expect me to Oh How I wish there
never had been any porcupines in the world or that all of them had died
before silly hateful people ever thought of trimming hat with them
They curl round and tickle my ear They blow against my cheek and sting
it like needles They do look outlandish you said so yourself a minute
ago Nobody ever had any but only just me The only porcupine was made
into the only quills for me and nobody else I wish instead of sticking
OUT of the nasty beasts that they stuck INTO them same as they do into
my cheek I suffer suffer suffer wearing them and hating them and
they will last forever and forever and when Im dead and cant help
myself somebodyll rip them out of my last years hat and stick them
on my head and Ill be buried in them Well when I am buried THEY
will be thats one good thing Oh if I ever have a child Ill let her
choose her own feathers and not make her wear ugly things like pigs
bristles and porcupine quills

With this lengthy tirade Rebecca vanished like a meteor through the
door and down the street while Miranda Sawyer gasped for breath and
prayed to Heaven to help her understand such human whirlwinds as this
Randall niece of hers

This was at three oclock and at halfpast three Rebecca was kneeling
on the rag carpet with her head in her aunts apron sobbing her
contrition

Oh Aunt Miranda do forgive me if you can Its the only time Ive
been bad for months You know it is You know you said last week I
hadnt been any trouble lately Something broke inside of me and came
tumbling out of my mouth in ugly words The porcupine quills make me
feel just as a bull does when he sees a red cloth nobody understands
how I suffer with them

Miranda Sawyer had learned a few lessons in the last two years lessons
which were making her at least on her good days a trifle kinder and
at any rate a juster woman than she used to be When she alighted on the
wrong side of her fourposter in the morning or felt an extra touch of
rheumatism she was still grim and unyielding but sometimes a curious
sort of melting process seemed to go on within her when her whole bony
structure softened and her eyes grew less vitreous At such moments
Rebecca used to feel as if a superincumbent iron pot had been lifted off
her head allowing her to breath freely and enjoy the sunshine

Well she said finally after staring first at Rebecca and then at the
porcupine quills as if to gain some insight into the situation well
I never sence I was born int the world heerd such a speech as youve
spoke an I guess there probably never was one Youd better tell the
minister what you said and see what he thinks of his prize Sundayschool
scholar But Im too old and tired to scold and fuss and try to train
you same as I did at first You can punish yourself this time like
you used to Go fire something down the well same as you did your pink
parasol Youve apologized and we wont say no more about it today but
I expect you to show by extry good conduct how sorry you be You care
altogether too much about your looks and your clothes for a child and
youve got a temper thatll certainly land you in states prison some o
these days

Rebecca wiped her eyes and laughed aloud No no Aunt Miranda it
wont really That wasnt temper I dont get angry with PEOPLE but
only once in a long while with things like thosecover them up
quick before I begin again Im all right Showers over suns out

Miss Miranda looked at her searchingly and uncomprehendingly Rebeccas
state of mind came perilously near to disease she thought

Have you seen me buyin any new bunnits or your Aunt Jane she asked
cuttingly Is there any particular reason why you should dress better
than your elders You might as well know that were short of cash just
now your Aunt Jane and me and have no intention of riggin you out
like a Milltown factry girl

Ohh cried Rebecca the quick tears starting again to her eyes and
the color fading out of her cheeks as she scrambled up from her knees
to a seat on the sofa beside her aunt Ohh How ashamed I am Quick
sew those quills on to the brown turban while Im good If I cant stand
them Ill make a neat little gingham bag and slip over them

And so the matter ended not as it customarily did with cold words on
Miss Mirandas part and bitter feelings on Rebeccas but with a gleam
of mutual understanding

Mrs Cobb who was a master hand at coloring dipped the offending
quills in brown dye and left them to soak in it all night not only
making them a nice warm color but somewhat weakening their rocky
spines so that they were not quite as rampantly hideous as before in
Rebeccas opinion

Then Mrs Perkins went to her bandbox in the attic and gave Miss
Dearborn some pale blue velvet with which she bound the brim of the
brown turban and made a wonderful rosette out of which the porcupines
defensive armor sprang buoyantly and gallantly like the plume of Henry
of Navarre

Rebecca was resigned if not greatly comforted but she had grace enough
to conceal her feelings now that she knew economy was at the root
of some of her aunts decrees in matters of dress and she managed to
forget the solferino breast save in sleep where a vision of it had a
way of appearing to her dangling from the ceiling and dazzling her
so with its rich color that she used to hope the milliner would sell it
that she might never be tempted with it when she passed the shop window

One day not long afterward Miss Miranda borrowed Mr Perkinss horse
and wagon and took Rebecca with her on a drive to Union to see about
some sausage meat and head cheese She intended to call on Mrs Cobb
order a load of pine wood from Mr Strout on the way and leave some
rags for a rug with old Mrs Pease so that the journey could be made
as profitable as possible consistent with the loss of time and the wear
and tear on her secondbest black dress

The redwinged black hat was forcibly removed from Rebeccas head just
before starting and the nightmare turban substituted

You might as well begin to wear it first as last remarked Miranda
while Jane stood in the side door and sympathized secretly with Rebecca

I will said Rebecca ramming the stiff turban down on her head with a
vindictive grimace and snapping the elastic under her long braids but
it makes me think of what Mr Robinson said when the minister told him
his motherinlaw would ride in the same buggy with him at his wifes
funeral

I cant see how any speech of Mr Robinsons made years an years ago
can have anything to do with wearin your turban down to Union said
Miranda settling the lap robe over her knees

Well it can because he said Have it that way then but itll spile
the hull blamed trip for me

Jane closed the door suddenly partly because she experienced a desire
to smile a desire she had not felt for years before Rebecca came to
the brick house to live and partly because she had no wish to overhear
what her sister would say when she took in the full significance of
Rebeccas anecdote which was a favorite one with Mr Perkins

It was a cold blustering day with a high wind that promised to bring an
early fall of snow The trees were stripped bare of leaves the
ground was hard and the wagon wheels rattled noisily over the
thankyoumaams

Im glad I wore my Paisley shawl over my cloak said Miranda Be you
warm enough Rebecca Tie that white rigolette tighter round your neck
The wind fairly blows through my bones I most wish t wed waited till
a pleasanter day for this Union road is all up hill or down and we
shant get over the ground fast its so rough Dont forget when you
go into Scotts to say I want all the trimmins when they send me the
pork for mebbe I can try out a little mite o lard The last load o
pines gone turrible quick I must see if Bijah Flagg cant get us some
cutrounds at the mills when he hauls for Squire Bean next time Keep
your mind on your drivin Rebecca and dont look at the trees and the
sky so much Its the same sky and same trees that have been here right
along Go awful slow down this hill and walk the hoss over Cooks Brook
bridge for I always suspicion its goin to break down under me an I
shouldnt want to be dropped into that fast runnin water this cold day
Itll be froze stiff by this time next week Hadnt you better get out
and lead

The rest of the sentence was very possibly not vital but at any rate
it was never completed for in the middle of the bridge a fierce gale
of wind took Miss Mirandas Paisley shawl and blew it over her head The
long heavy ends whirled in opposite directions and wrapped themselves
tightly about her wavering bonnet Rebecca had the whip and the reins
and in trying to rescue her struggling aunt could not steady her own
hat which was suddenly torn from her head and tossed against the bridge
rail where it trembled and flapped for an instant

My hat Oh Aunt Miranda my hateful hat cried Rebecca never
remembering at the instant how often she had prayed that the fretful
porcupine might some time vanish in this violent manner since it
refused to die a natural death

She had already stopped the horse so giving her aunts shawl one last
desperate twitch she slipped out between the wagon wheels and darted
in the direction of the hated object the loss of which had dignified it
with a temporary value and importance

The stiff brown turban rose in the air then dropped and flew along the
bridge Rebecca pursued it danced along and stuck between two of the
railings Rebecca flew after it her long braids floating in the wind

Come back Come back Dont leave me alone with the team I wont have
it Come back and leave your hat

Miranda had at length extricated herself from the submerging shawl but
she was so blinded by the wind and so confused that she did not measure
the financial loss involved in her commands

Rebecca heard but her spirit being in arms she made one more mad
scramble for the vagrant hat which now seemed possessed with an evil
spirit for it flew back and forth and bounded here and there like
a living thing finally distinguishing itself by blowing between the
horses front and hind legs Rebecca trying to circumvent it by going
around the wagon and meeting it on the other side

It was no use as she darted from behind the wheels the wind gave the
hat an extra whirl and scurrying in the opposite direction it soared
above the bridge rail and disappeared into the rapid water below

Get in again cried Miranda holding on her bonnet You done your
best and it cant be helped I only wisht Id let you wear your black
hat as you wanted to and I wisht wed never come such a day The shawl
has broke the stems of the velvet geraniums in my bonnet and the wind
has blowed away my shawl pin and my back comb Id like to give up and
turn right back this minute but I dont like to borrer Perkinss hoss
again this month When we get up in the woods you can smooth your hair
down and tie the rigolette over your head and settle whats left of my
bonnet itll be an expensive errant this will

     

II

It was not till next morning that Rebeccas heart really began its song
of thanksgiving Her Aunt Miranda announced at breakfast that as Mrs
Perkins was going to Millikens Mills Rebecca might go too and buy a
serviceable hat

You mustnt pay over two dollars and a half and you mustnt get the
pink bird without Mrs Perkins says and the milliner says that it
wont fade nor moult Dont buy a lightcolored felt because youll get
sick of it in two or three years same as you did the brown one I always
liked the shape of the brown one and youll never get another trimmin
thatll wear like them quills

I hope not thought Rebecca

If you had put your elastic under your chin same as you used to and
not worn it behind because you think its more grownup an fashonable
the wind neverd a took the hat off your head and you wouldnt a lost
it but the mischiefs done and you can go right over to Mis Perkins
now so you wont miss her nor keep her waitin The two dollars and a
half is in an envelope side o the clock

Rebecca swallowed the last spoonful of pickedup codfish on her plate
wiped her lips and rose from her chair happier than the seraphs in
Paradise

The porcupine quills had disappeared from her life and without any
fault or violence on her part She was wholly innocent and virtuous but
nevertheless she was going to have a new hat with the solferino breast
should the adored object prove under rigorous examination to be
practically indestructible

Wheneer I take my walks abroad How many hats Ill see But if theyre
trimmed with hedgehog quills Theyll not belong to me

So she improvised secretly and ecstatically as she went towards the
side entry

Theres Bijah Flagg drivin in said Miss Miranda going to the
window Step out and see what hes got Jane some passel from the
Squire I guess Its a paper bag and it may be a punkin though he
wouldnt wrop up a punkin come to think of it Shet the dinin room
door Jane its turrible drafty Make haste for the Squires hoss
never stans still a minute cept when hes goin

Abijah Flagg alighted and approached the side door with a grin

Guess what Ive got for ye Rebecky

No throb of prophetic soul warned Rebecca of her approaching doom

Nodhead apples she sparkled looking as bright and rosy and
satinskinned as an apple herself

No guess again

A flowering geranium

Guess again

Nuts Oh I cant Bijah Im just going to Millikens Mills on an
errand and Im afraid of missing Mrs Perkins Show me quick Is it
really for me or for Aunt Miranda

Reely for you I guess and he opened the large brown paper bag and
drew from it the remains of a watersoaked hat

They WERE remains but there was no doubt of their nature and substance
They had clearly been a hat in the past and one could even suppose
that when resuscitated they might again assume their original form in
some near and happy future

Miss Miranda full of curiosity joined the group in the side entry at
this dramatic moment

Well I never she exclaimed Where and how under the canopy did
you ever

I was working on the dam at Union Falls yesterday chuckled Abijah
with a pleased glance at each of the trio in turn an I seen this
little bunnit skippin over the water jest as Becky does over the road
Its shaped kind o like a boat an gorry ef it want sailin jest
like a boat Where hev I seen that kind of a bristlin plume thinks
I

Where indeed thought Rebecca stormily

Then it come to me that Id drove that plume to school and drove it to
meetin and drove it to the Fair androve it most everywheres on Becky
So I reached out a pole an ketched it fore it got in amongst the logs
an come to any damage an here it is The hats passed in its checks
I guess looks kind as if a wet elephant had stepped on it but the
plumes bouts good as new I reely fetched the hat beck for the sake o
the plume

It was real good of you Bijah an were all of us obliged to you
said Miranda as she poised the hat on one hand and turned it slowly
with the other

Well I do say she exclaimed and I guess Ive said it before that
of all the wearing plumes that ever I see that ones the wearinest
Seems though it just wouldnt give up Look at the way its held Mis
Cobbs dye its about as browns when it went int the water

Dyed but not a mite dead grinned Abijah who was somewhat celebrated
for his puns

And I declare Miranda continued when you think o the fuss they
make about ostriches killin em off by hundreds for the sake o their
feathers thatll string out and spoil in one hard rainstorman all
the time lettin useful porcupines run round with their quills on why
I cant hardly understand it without milliners have found out jest
how good they do last an so they wont use em for trimmin Bijahs
right the hat aint no more use Rebecca but you can buy you another
this morninany color or shape you fancyan have Miss Morton sew
these brown quills on to it with some kind of a buckle or a bow jest
to hide the roots Then youll be fixed for another season thanks to
Bijah

Uncle Jerry and Aunt Sarah Cobb were made acquainted before very long
with the part that destiny or Abijah Flagg had played in Rebeccas
affairs for accompanied by the teacher she walked to the old stage
drivers that same afternoon Taking off her new hat with the venerable
trimming she laid it somewhat ostentatiously upside down on the kitchen
table and left the room dimpling a little more than usual

Uncle Jerry rose from his seat and crossing the room looked curiously
into the hat and found that a circular paper lining was neatly pinned
in the crown and that it bore these lines which were read aloud with
great effect by Miss Dearborn and with her approval were copied in the
Thought Book for the benefit of posterity

It was the bristling porcupine As he stood on his native heath He
said Ill pluck me some immortelles And make me up a wreath For tho
I may not live myself To more than a hundred and ten My quills will
last till crack of doom And maybe after then They can be colored blue
or green Or orange brown or red But often as they may be dyed They
never will be dead And so the bristling porcupine As he stood on his
native heath Said I think Ill pluck me some immmortelles And make me
up a wreath

Fifth Chronicle THE SAVING OF THE COLORS


I

Even when Rebecca had left school having attained the great age of
seventeen and therefore able to look back over a past incredibly long
and full she still reckoned time not by years but by certain important
occurrences

There was the year her father died the year she left Sunnybrook Farm to
come to her aunts in Riverboro the year Sister Hannah became engaged
the year little Mira died the year Abijah Flagg ceased to be Squire
Beans choreboy and astounded Riverboro by departing for Limerick
Academy in search of an education and finally the year of her
graduation which to the mind of seventeen seems rather the
culmination than the beginning of existence

Between these epochmaking events certain other happenings stood out in
bold relief against the gray of dull daily life

There was the day she first met her friend of friends Mr Aladdin
and the later even more radiant one when he gave her the coral
necklace There was the day the Simpson family moved away from Riverboro
under a cloud and she kissed Clara Belle fervently at the crossroads
telling her that she would always be faithful There was the visit of
the Syrian missionaries to the brick house That was a bright romantic
memory as strange and brilliant as the wonderful little birds wings
and breasts that the strangers brought from the Far East She remembered
the moment they asked her to choose some for herself and the rapture
with which she stroked the beautiful things as they lay on the black
haircloth sofa Then there was the coming of the new minister for
though many were tried only one was chosen and finally there was the
flagraising a festivity that thrilled Riverboro and Edgewood society
from centre to circumference a festivity that took place just before
she entered the Female Seminary at Wareham and said goodby to kind Miss
Dearborn and the village school

There must have been other flagraisings in historyeven the persons
most interested in this particular one would grudgingly have allowed
that muchbut it would have seemed to them improbable that any such
flagraising as theirs either in magnitude of conception or brilliancy
of actual performance could twice glorify the same century Of some
pageants it is tacitly admitted that there can be no duplicates and the
flagraising at Riverboro Centre was one of these so that it is small
wonder if Rebecca chose it as one of the important dates in her personal
almanac

The new ministers wife was the being under Providence who had
conceived the germinal idea of the flag

At this time the parish had almost settled down to the trembling belief
that they were united on a pastor In the earlier time a minister was
chosen for life and if he had faults which was a probably enough
contingency and if his congregation had any which is within the bounds
of possibility each bore with the other not quite without friction
as oldfashioned husbands and wives once did before the easy way out of
the difficulty was discovered or at least before it was popularized

The faithful old parson had died after thirty years preaching
and perhaps the newer methods had begun to creep in for it seemed
impossible to suit the two communities most interested in the choice

The Rev Mr Davis for example was a spirited preacher but persisted
in keeping two horses in the parsonage stable and in exchanging
them whenever he could get faster ones As a parochial visitor he was
incomparable dashing from house to house with such speed that he could
cover the parish in a single afternoon This sporting tendency which
would never have been remarked in a British parson was frowned upon in
a New England village and Deacon Milliken told Mr Davis when giving
him what he alluded to as his walking papers that they didnt want
the Edgewood church run by hoss power

The next candidate pleased Edgewood where morning preaching was held
but the other parish which had afternoon service declined to accept
him because he wore a wigan illmatched crookedly applied wig

Number three was eloquent but given to gesticulation and Mrs Jere
Burbank the president of the Dorcas Society who sat in a front pew
said she couldnt bear to see a preacher scramble round the pulpit hot
Sundays

Number four a genial handsome man gifted in prayer was found to be
a Democrat The congregation was overwhelmingly Republican in its
politics and perceived something ludicrous if not positively
blasphemous in a Democrat preaching the gospel Ananias and
Beelzebubll be candidatin here first thing we know exclaimed the
outraged Republican nominee for district attorney

Number five had a feebleminded child which the hiring committee
prophesied would always be standing in the parsonage front yard making
talk for the other denominations

Number six was the Rev Judson Baxter the present incumbent and he
was voted to be as near perfection as a minister can be in this finite
world His young wife had a small income of her own a distinct and
unusual advantage and the subscription committee hoped that they might
not be eternally driving over the country to get somebodys fifty cents
that had been overdue for eight months but might take their onerous
duties a little more easily

It does seem as if our ministers were the poorest lot complained Mrs
Robinson If their salary is two months behindhand they begin to be
nervous Seems as though they might lay up a little before they come
here and not live from hand to mouth so The Baxters seem quite
different and I only hope they wont get wasteful and run into debt
They say she keeps the parlor blinds open bout half the time and the
room is lit up so often evenins that the neighbors think her and Mr
Baxter must set in there It dont seem hardly as if it could be so but
Mrs Buzzell says tis and she says we might as well say goodby to the
parlor carpet which is church property for the Baxters are living all
over it

This criticism was the only discordant note in the chorus of praise and
the people gradually grew accustomed to the open blinds and the overused
parlor carpet which was just completing its twentyfifth year of honest
service

Mrs Baxter communicated her patriotic idea of a new flag to the Dorcas
Society proposing that the women should cut and make it themselves

It may not be quite as good as those manufactured in the large cities
she said but we shall be proud to see our homemade flag flying in the
breeze and it will mean all the more to the young voters growing up to
remember that their mothers made it with their own hands

How would it do to let some of the girls help modestly asked Miss
Dearborn the Riverboro teacher We might choose the best sewers and
let them put in at least a few stitches so that they can feel they have
a share in it

Just the thing exclaimed Mrs Baxter We can cut the stripes and sew
them together and after we have basted on the white stars the girls can
apply them to the blue ground We must have it ready for the campaign
rally and we couldnt christen it at a better time than in this
presidential year

II

In this way the great enterprise was started and day by day the
preparations went forward in the two villages

The boys as future voters and fighters demanded an active share in
the proceedings and were organized by Squire Bean into a fife and drum
corps so that by day and night martial but most inharmonious music woke
the echoes and deafened mothers felt their patriotism oozing out at the
soles of their shoes

Dick Carter was made captain for his grandfather had a gold medal
given him by Queen Victoria for rescuing three hundred and twentysix
passengers from a sinking British vessel Riverboro thought it high time
to pay some graceful tribute to Great Britain in return for her handsome
conduct to Captain Nahum Carter and human imagination could contrive
nothing more impressive than a vicarious share in the flag raising

Living Perkins tried to be happy in the ranks for he was offered no
official position principally Mrs Smellie observed because his
fathers war record want clean Oh yes Jim Perkins went to the
war she continued He hid out behind the hencoop when they was
draftin but they found him and took him along He got into one battle
too somehow or nother but he run away from it He was allers cautious
Jim was if he ever see trouble of any kind comin towards him he was
out o sight fore it got a chance to light He said eight dollars a
month without bounty wouldnt pay HIM to stop bullets for He wouldnt
fight a skeeter Jim wouldnt but land we aint to war all the time
and hes a good neighbor and a good blacksmith

Miss Dearborn was to be Columbia and the older girls of the two schools
were to be the States Such trade in muslins and red white and blue
ribbons had never been known since Watson kep store and the number
of brief white petticoats hanging out to bleach would have caused the
passing stranger to imagine Riverboro a continual dancing school

Juvenile virtue both male and female reached an almost impossible
height for parents had only to lift a finger and say you shant go
to the flag raising and the refractory spirit at once armed itself for
new struggles toward the perfect life

Mr Jeremiah Cobb had consented to impersonate Uncle Sam and was to
drive Columbia and the States to the raising on the top of his own
stage Meantime the boys were drilling the ladies were cutting and
basting and stitching and the girls were sewing on stars for the
starry part of the spangled banner was to remain with each of them in
turn until she had performed her share of the work

It was felt by one and all a fine and splendid service indeed to help
in the making of the flag and if Rebecca was proud to be of the chosen
ones so was her Aunt Jane Sawyer who had taught her all her delicate
stitches

On a longlookedfor afternoon in August the ministers wife drove up
to the brick house door and handed out the great piece of bunting to
Rebecca who received it in her arms with as much solemnity as if it had
been a child awaiting baptismal rites

Im so glad she sighed happily I thought it would never come my
turn

You should have had it a week ago but Huldah Meserve upset the ink
bottle over her star and we had to baste on another one You are the
last though and then we shall sew the stars and stripes together and
Seth Strout will get the top ready for hanging Just think it wont
be many days before you children will be pulling the rope with all your
strength the band will be playing the men will be cheering and the
new flag will go higher and higher till the red white and blue shows
against the sky

Rebeccas eyes fairly blazed Shall I fell on my star or buttonhole
it she asked

Look at all the others and make the most beautiful stitches you can
thats all It is your star you know and you can even imagine it is
your state and try and have it the best of all If everybody else
is trying to do the same thing with her state that will make a great
country wont it

Rebeccas eyes spoke glad confirmation of the idea My star my state
she repeated joyously Oh Mrs Baxter Ill make such fine stitches
youll think the white grew out of the blue

The new ministers wife looked pleased to see her spark kindle a flame
in the young heart You can sew so much of yourself into your star
she went on in the glad voice that made her so winsome that when you
are an old lady you can put on your specs and find it among all the
others Goodby Come up to the parsonage Saturday afternoon Mr Baxter
wants to see you

Judson help that dear little genius of a Rebecca all you can she
said that night when they were cosily talking in their parlor and
living all over the parish carpet I dont know what she may or may
not come to some day I only wish she were ours If you could have
seen her clasp the flag tight in her arms and put her cheek against it
and watched the tears of feeling start in her eyes when I told her
that her star was her state I kept whispering to myself Covet not thy
neighbors child

Daily at four oclock Rebecca scrubbed her hands almost to the bone
brushed her hair and otherwise prepared herself in body mind and
spirit for the consecrated labor of sewing on her star All the time
that her needle cautiously conscientiously formed the tiny stitches she
was making rhymes in her head her favorite achievement being this

Your star my star all our stars together They make the dear old
banner proud To float in the bright fall weather

There was much discussion as to which of the girls should impersonate
the State of Maine for that was felt to be the highest honor in the
gift of the committee

Alice Robinson was the prettiest child in the village but she was very
shy and by no means a general favorite

Minnie Smellie possessed the handsomest dress and a pair of white
slippers and openwork stockings that nearly carried the day Still as
Miss Delia Weeks well said she was so stupid that if she should
suck her thumb in the very middle of the exercises nobodyd be a dite
surprised

Huldah Meserve was next voted upon and the fact that if she were not
chosen her father might withdraw his subscription to the brass band fund
was a matter for grave consideration

I kind o hate to have such a giggler for the State of Maine let her
be the Goddess of Liberty proposed Mrs Burbank whose patriotism was
more local than national

How would Rebecca Randall do for Maine and let her speak some of her
verses suggested the new ministers wife who could she have had her
way would have given all the prominent parts to Rebecca from Uncle Sam
down

So beauty fashion and wealth having been tried and found wanting the
committee discussed the claims of talent and it transpired that to
the awestricken Rebecca fell the chief plum in the pudding It was a
tribute to her gifts that there was no jealousy or envy among the other
girls they readily conceded her special fitness for the role

Her life had not been pressed down full to the brim of pleasures and
she had a sort of distrust of joy in the bud Not until she saw it in
full radiance of bloom did she dare embrace it She had never read
any verse but Byron Felicia Hemans bits of Paradise Lost and the
selections in the school readers but she would have agreed heartily
with the poet who said

Not by appointment do we meet delight And joy they heed not our
expectancy But round some corner in the streets of life They on a
sudden clasp us with a smile

For many nights before the raising when she went to her bed she said to
herself after she had finished her prayers It cant be true that Im
chosen for the State of Maine It just CANT be true Nobody could be
good ENOUGH but oh Ill try to be as good as I can To be going to
Wareham Seminary next week and to be the State of Maine too Oh I must
pray HARD to God to keep me meek and humble

III

The flag was to be raised on a Tuesday and on the previous Sunday it
became known to the children that Clara Belle Simpson was coming back
from Acreville coming to live with Mrs Fogg and take care of the
baby called by the neighborhood boys the Fogg horn on account of his
excellent voice production

Clara Belle was one of Miss Dearborns original flock and if she
were left wholly out of the festivities she would be the only girl of
suitable age to be thus slighted it seemed clear to the juvenile mind
therefore that neither she nor her descendants would ever recover from
such a blow But under all the circumstances would she be allowed to
join in the procession Even Rebecca the optimistic feared not
and the committee confirmed her fears by saying that Abner Simpsons
daughter certainly could not take any prominent part in the ceremony
but they hoped that Mrs Fogg would allow her to witness it

When Abner Simpson urged by the town authorities took his wife and
seven children away from Riverboro to Acreville just over the border in
the next county Riverboro went to bed leaving its barn and shed doors
unfastened and drew long breaths of gratitude to Providence

Of most winning disposition and genial manners Mr Simpson had not
that instinctive comprehension of property rights which renders a man a
valuable citizen

Squire Bean was his nearest neighbor and he conceived the novel idea
of paying Simpson five dollars a year not to steal from him a method
occasionally used in the Highlands in the early days

The bargain was struck and adhered to religiously for a twelvemonth
but on the second of January Mr Simpson announced the verbal contract
as formally broken

I didnt know what I was doin when I made it Squire he urged
In the first place its a slur on my reputation and an injury to my
selfrespect Secondly its a nervous strain on me and thirdly five
dollars dont pay me

Squire Bean was so struck with the unique and convincing nature of
these arguments that he could scarcely restrain his admiration and he
confessed to himself afterward that unless Simpsons mental attitude
could be changed he was perhaps a fitter subject for medical science
than the state prison

Abner was a most unusual thief and conducted his operations with a tact
and neighborly consideration none too common in the profession He would
never steal a mans scythe in hayingtime nor his fur laprobe in the
coldest of the winter The picking of a lock offered no attractions
to him he want no burglar he would have scornfully asserted A
strange horse and wagon hitched by the roadside was the most flagrant
of his thefts but it was the small thingsthe hatchet or axe on the
choppingblock the tin pans sunning at the side door a stray garment
bleaching on the grass a hoe rake shovel or a bag of early potatoes
that tempted him most sorely and these appealed to him not so much for
their intrinsic value as because they were so excellently adapted to
swapping The swapping was really the enjoyable part of the procedure
the theft was only a sad but necessary preliminary for if Abner
himself had been a man of sufficient property to carry on his business
operations independently it is doubtful if he would have helped himself
so freely to his neighbors goods

Riverboro regretted the loss of Mrs Simpson who was useful in
scrubbing cleaning and washing and was thought to exercise some
influence over her predatory spouse There was a story of their early
married life when they had a farm a story to the effect that Mrs
Simpson always rode on every load of hay that her husband took to
Milltown with the view of keeping him sober through the day After he
turned out of the country road and approached the metropolis it was
said that he used to bury the docile lady in the load He would then
drive on to the scales have the weight of the hay entered in the
buyers book take his horses to the stable for feed and water and when
a favorable opportunity offered he would assist the hot and panting Mrs
Simpson out of the side or back of the rack and gallantly brush the
straw from her person For this reason it was always asserted that Abner
Simpson sold his wife every time he went to Milltown but the story was
never fully substantiated and at all events it was the only suspected
blot on meek Mrs Simpsons personal reputation

As for the Simpson children they were missed chiefly as familiar
figures by the roadside but Rebecca honestly loved Clara Belle
notwithstanding her Aunt Mirandas opposition to the intimacy Rebeccas
taste for low company was a source of continual anxiety to her aunt

Anything thats human flesh is good enough for her Miranda groaned to
Jane Shell ride with the ragsackandbottle peddler just as quick as
she would with the minister she always sets beside the St Vitus dance
young one at Sabbath school and shes forever riggin and onriggin
that dirty Simpson baby She reminds me of a puppy thatll always go to
everybody thatll have him

It was thought very creditable to Mrs Fogg that she sent for Clara
Belle to live with her and go to school part of the year

Shell be useful said Mrs Fogg and shell be out of her fathers
way and so keep honest though shes no awful hombly Ive no fears for
her A girl with her red hair freckles and crosseyes cant fall into
no kind of sin I dont believe

Mrs Fogg requested that Clara Belle should be started on her journey
from Acreville by train and come the rest of the way by stage and she
was disturbed to receive word on Sunday that Mr Simpson had borrowed a
good roader from a new acquaintance and would himself drive the girl
from Acreville to Riverboro a distance of thirtyfive miles That he
would arrive in their vicinity on the very night before the flagraising
was thought by Riverboro to be a public misfortune and several
residents hastily determined to deny themselves a sight of the
festivities and remain watchfully on their own premises

On Monday afternoon the children were rehearsing their songs at the
meetinghouse As Rebecca came out on the broad wooden steps she watched
Mrs Peter Meserves buggy out of sight for in front wrapped in a
cotton sheet lay the previous flag After a few chattering goodbys
and weather prophecies with the other girls she started on her homeward
walk dropping in at the parsonage to read her verses to the minister

He welcomed her gladly as she removed her white cotton gloves hastily
slipped on outside the door for ceremony and pushed back the funny hat
with the yellow and black porcupine quillsthe hat with which she made
her first appearance in Riverboro society

Youve heard the beginning Mr Baxter now will you please tell me if
you like the last verse she asked taking out her paper Ive only
read it to Alice Robinson and I think perhaps she can never be a poet
though shes a splendid writer Last year when she was twelve she wrote
a birthday poem to herself and she made natal rhyme with Milton
which of course it wouldnt I remember every verse ended

 This is my day so natal
 And I will follow Milton

Another one of hers was written just because she couldnt help it she
said This was it

 Let me to the hills away
 Give me pen and paper
 Ill write until the earth will sway
 The story of my Maker

The minister could scarcely refrain from smiling but he controlled
himself that he might lose none of Rebeccas quaint observations
When she was perfectly at ease unwatched and uncriticised she was a
marvelous companion

The name of the poem is going to be My Star she continued and Mrs
Baxter gave me all the ideas but somehow theres a kind of magicness
when they get into poetry dont you think so Rebecca always talked
to grown people as if she were their age or a more subtle and truer
distinction as if they were hers

It has often been so remarked in different words agreed the
minister

Mrs Baxter said that each star was a state and if each state did its
best we should have a splendid country Then once she said that we ought
to be glad the war is over and the States are all at peace together and
I thought Columbia must be glad too for Miss Dearborn says shes
the mother of all the States So Im going to have it end like this I
didnt write it I just sewed it while I was working on my star

 For its your star my star all the stars together
 That make our countrys flag so proud
 To float in the bright fall weather
 Northern stars Southern stars stars of the East and West
 Side by side they lie at peace
 On the dear flags motherbreast

Oh many are the poets that are sown by nature thought the
minister quoting Wordsworth to himself And I wonder what becomes of
them Thats a pretty idea little Rebecca and I dont know whether
you or my wife ought to have the more praise What made you think of the
stars lying on the flags motherbreast Where did you get that word

Why and the young poet looked rather puzzled thats the way it is
the flag is the whole countrythe motherand the stars are the states
The stars had to lie somewhere LAP nor ARMS wouldnt sound well
with West so of course I said BREAST Rebecca answered with some
surprise at the question and the minister put his hand under her chin
and kissed her softly on the forehead when he said goodby at the door

IV

Rebecca walked rapidly along in the gathering twilight thinking of the
eventful morrow

As she approached the turning on the left called the old Milltown
road she saw a white horse and wagon driven by a man with a rakish
flapping Panama hat come rapidly around the turn and disappear over
the long hills leading down to the falls There was no mistaking him
there never was another Abner Simpson with his lean height his bushy
reddish hair the gay cock of his hat and the long piratical upturned
mustaches which the boys used to say were used as hatracks by the
Simpson children at night The old Milltown road ran past Mrs Foggs
house so he must have left Clara Belle there and Rebeccas heart
glowed to think that her poor little friend need not miss the raising

She began to run now fearful of being late for supper and covered the
ground to the falls in a brief time As she crossed the bridge she again
saw Abner Simpsons team drawn up at the watering trough

Coming a little nearer with the view of inquiring for the family her
quick eye caught sight of something unexpected A gust of wind blew up
a corner of a linen laprobe in the back of the wagon and underneath
it she distinctly saw the whitesheeted bundle that held the flag the
bundle with a tiny tiny spot of red bunting peeping out at one corner
It is true she had eaten slept dreamed red white and blue for weeks
but there was no mistaking the evidence of her senses the idolized
flag longed for worked for sewed for that flag was in the back of
Abner Simpsons wagon and if so what would become of the raising

Acting on blind impulse she ran toward the wateringtrough calling out
in her clear treble Mr Simpson Oh Mr Simpson will you let me ride
a piece with you and hear all about Clara Belle Im going part way over
to the Centre on an errand So she was a most important errandto
recover the flag of her country at present in the hands of the foe

Mr Simpson turned round in his seat and cried heartily Certain sure I
will for he liked the fair sex young and old and Rebecca had always
been a prime favorite with him Climb right in Hows everybody Glad
to see ye The folks talk bout ye from sunup to sundown and Clara
Belle cant hardly wait for a sight of ye

Rebecca scrambled up trembling and pale with excitement She did not in
the least know what was going to happen but she was sure that the flag
when in the enemys country must be at least a little safer with the
State of Maine sitting on top of it

Mr Simpson began a long monologue about Acreville the house he lived
in the pond in front of it Mrs Simpsons health and various items of
news about the children varied by reports of his personal misfortunes
He put no questions and asked no replies so this gave the
inexperienced soldier a few seconds to plan a campaign There were
three houses to pass the Browns at the corner the Millikens and the
Robinsons on the brow of the hill If Mr Robinson were in the front
yard she might tell Mr Simpson she wanted to call there and ask Mr
Robinson to hold the horses head while she got out of the wagon
Then she might fly to the back before Mr Simpson could realize the
situation and dragging out the precious bundle sit on it hard while
Mr Robinson settled the matter of ownership with Mr Simpson

This was feasible but it meant a quarrel between the two men who held
an ancient grudge against each other and Mr Simpson was a valiant
fighter as the various sheriffs who had attempted to arrest him could
cordially testify It also meant that everybody in the village would
hear of the incident and poor Clara Belle be branded again as the child
of a thief

Another idea danced into her excited brain such a clever one she could
hardly believe it hers She might call Mr Robinson to the wagon and
when he came close to the wheels she might say all of a sudden
Please take the flag out of the back of the wagon Mr Robinson We
have brought it here for you to keep overnight Mr Simpson might be
so surprised that he would give up his prize rather than be suspected of
stealing

But as they neared the Robinsons house there was not a sign of life
to be seen so the last plan ingenious though it was was perforce
abandoned

The road now lay between thick pine woods with no dwelling in sight
It was growing dusk and Rebecca was driving along the lonely way with a
person who was generally called Slippery Simpson

Not a thought of fear crossed her mind save the fear of bungling in
her diplomacy and so losing the flag She knew Mr Simpson well and a
pleasanter man was seldom to be met She recalled an afternoon when he
came home and surprised the whole school playing the Revolutionary War
in his helterskelter dooryard and the way in which he had joined the
British forces and impersonated General Burgoyne had greatly endeared
him to her The only difficulty was to find proper words for her
delicate mission for of course if Mr Simpsons anger were aroused
he would politely push her out of the wagon and drive away with the
flag Perhaps if she led the conversation in the right direction an
opportunity would present itself She well remembered how Emma Jane
Perkins had failed to convert Jacob Moody simply because she failed to
lead up to the delicate question of his manner of life Clearing her
throat nervously she began Is it likely to be fair tomorrow

Guess so clear as a bell Whats on foot a picnic

No were to have a grand flagraising That is she thought if
we have any flag to raise

That so Where

The three villages are to club together and have a rally and raise
the flag at the Centre Therell be a brass band and speakers and the
Mayor of Portland and the man that will be governor if hes elected
and a dinner in the Grange Hall and we girls are chosen to raise the
flag

I want to know Thatll be grand wont it Still not a sign of
consciousness on the part of Abner

I hope Mrs Fogg will take Clara Belle for it will be splendid to look
at Mr Cobb is going to be Uncle Sam and drive us on the stage Miss
DearbornClara Belles old teacher you knowis going to be Columbia
the girls will be the States of the Union and oh Mr Simpson I am the
one to be the State of Maine This was not altogether to the point
but a piece of information impossible to conceal

Mr Simpson flourished the whipstock and gave a loud hearty laugh Then
he turned in his seat and regarded Rebecca curiously Youre kind of
small haint ye for so big a state as this one he asked

Any of us would be too small replied Rebecca with dignity but the
committee asked me and I am going to try hard to do well

The tragic thought that there might be no occasion for anybody to do
anything well or ill suddenly overcame her here and putting her
hand on Mr Simpsons sleeve she attacked the subject practically and
courageously

Oh Mr Simpson dear Mr Simpson its such a mortifying subject I
cant bear to say anything about it but please give us back our flag
Dont DONT take it over to Acreville Mr Simpson Weve worked so
long to make it and it was so hard getting the money for the bunting
Wait a minute please dont be angry and dont say no just yet till
I explain more Itll be so dreadful for everybody to get there tomorrow
morning and find no flag to raise and the band and the mayor all
disappointed and the children crying with their muslin dresses all
bought for nothing O dear Mr Simpson please dont take our flag away
from us

The apparently astonished Abner pulled his mustaches and exclaimed But
I dont know what youre drivin at Whos got yer flag I haint

Could duplicity deceit and infamy go any further Rebecca wondered
and her soul filling with righteous wrath she cast discretion to the
winds and spoke a little more plainly bending her great swimming eyes
on the now embarrassed Abner who looked like an angleworm wriggling
on a pin

Mr Simpson how can you say that when I saw the flag in the back of
your wagon myself when you stopped to water the horse Its wicked of
you to take it and I cannot bear it Her voice broke now for a doubt
of Mr Simpsons yielding suddenly darkened her mind If you keep it
youll have to keep me for I wont be parted from it I cant fight
like the boys but I can pinch and scratch and I WILL scratch just
like a pantherIll lie right down on my star and not move if I starve
to death

Look here hold your hosses n dont cry till you git something to cry
for grumbled the outraged Abner to whom a clue had just come and
leaning over the wagonback he caught hold of a corner of white sheet
and dragged up the bundle scooping off Rebeccas hat in the process
and almost burying her in bunting

She caught the treasure passionately to her heart and stifled her sobs
in it while Abner exclaimed I swan to man if that haint a flag
Well in that case youre good n welcome to it Land I seen that
bundle lyin in the middle o the road and I says to myself thats
somebodys washin and Id better pick it up and leave it at the
postoffice to be claimed n all the time it was a flag

This was a Simpsonian version of the matter the fact being that a
whitecovered bundle lying on the Meserves front steps had attracted
his practiced eye and slipping in at the open gate he had swiftly and
deftly removed it to his wagon on general principles thinking if it
were clean clothes it would be extremely useful and in any event there
was no good in passing by something flung into your very arms so to
speak He had had no leisure to examine the bundle and indeed took
little interest in it Probably he stole it simply from force of habit
and because there was nothing else in sight to steal everybodys
premises being preternaturally tidy and empty almost as if his visit
had been expected

Rebecca was a practical child and it seemed to her almost impossible
that so heavy a bundle should fall out of Mrs Meserves buggy and not
be noticed but she hoped that Mr Simpson was telling the truth and
she was too glad and grateful to doubt anyone at the moment

Thank you thank you ever so much Mr Simpson Youre the nicest
kindest politest man I ever knew and the girls will be so pleased you
gave us back the flag and so will the Dorcas Society theyll be sure
to write you a letter of thanks they always do

Tell em not to bother bout any thanks said Simpson beaming
virtuously But land Im glad twas me that happened to see that bundle
in the road and take the trouble to pick it up Jest to think of its
bein a flag he thought if ever there was a pesky wuthless thing to
trade off twould be a great gormin flag like that

Can I get out now please asked Rebecca I want to go back for Mrs
Meserve will be dreadfully nervous when she finds out she dropped the
flag and she has heart trouble

No you dont objected Mr Simpson gallantly turning the horse Do
you think Id let a little creeter like you lug that great heavy bundle
I haint got time to go back to Meserves but Ill take you to the
corner and dump you there flag n all and you can get some o the
menfolks to carry it the rest o the way Youll wear it out huggin
it so

I helped make it and I adore it said Rebecca who was in a
highpitched and grandiloquent mood Why dont YOU like it Its your
countrys flag

Simpson smiled an indulgent smile and looked a trifle bored at these
frequent appeals to his extremely rusty higher feelings

I don knows Ive got any particlar intrest in the country he
remarked languidly I know I dont owe nothin to it nor own nothin
in it

You own a star on the flag same as everybody argued Rebecca who had
been feeding on patriotism for a month and you own a state too like
all of us

Land I wisht I did or even a quarter section sighed Mr Simpson
feeling somehow a little more povertystricken and discouraged than
usual

As they approached the corner and the wateringtrough where four
crossroads met the whole neighborhood seemed to be in evidence
and Mr Simpson suddenly regretted his chivalrous escort of Rebecca
especially when as he neared the group an excited lady wringing her
hands turned out to be Mrs Peter Meserve accompanied by Huldah the
Browns Mrs Milliken Abijah Flagg and Miss Dearborn

Do you know anything about the new flag Rebecca shrieked Mrs
Meserve too agitated at the moment to notice the childs companion

Its right here in my lap all safe responded Rebecca joyously

You careless meddlesome young one to take it off my steps where
I left it just long enough to go round to the back and hunt up my
doorkey Youve given me a fit of sickness with my weak heart and what
business was it of yours I believe you think you OWN the flag Hand it
over to me this minute

Rebecca was climbing down during this torrent of language but as she
turned she flashed one look of knowledge at the false Simpson a look
that went through him from head to foot as if it were carried by
electricity

He had not deceived her after all owing to the angry chatter of Mrs
Meserve He had been handcuffed twice in his life but no sheriff had
ever discomfited him so thoroughly as this child Fury mounted to his
brain and as soon as she was safely out from between the wheels he
stood up in the wagon and flung the flag out in the road in the midst of
the excited group

Take it you pious passimonious cheeseparin hairsplittin
backbitin flagraisin crew he roared Rebecca never took the
flag I found it in the road I say

You never no such a thing exclaimed Mrs Meserve You found it on
the doorsteps in my garden

Mebbe twas your garden but it was so chock full o weeks I THOUGHT
twas the road retorted Abner I vow I wouldnt a given the old
rag back to one o YOU not if you begged me on your bended knees But
Rebeccas a friend o my folks and can do with her flags shes a mind
to and the rest o ye can go to thundern stay there for all I
care

So saying he made a sharp turn gave the gaunt white horse a lash and
disappeared in a cloud of dust before the astonished Mr Brown the
only man in the party had a thought of detaining him

Im sorry I spoke so quick Rebecca said Mrs Meserve greatly
mortified at the situation But dont you believe a word that lyin
critter said He did steal it off my doorstep and how did you come to
be ridin and consortin with him I believe it would kill your Aunt
Miranda if she should hear about it

The little schoolteacher put a sheltering arm round Rebecca as Mr
Brown picked up the flag and dusted and folded it

Im willing she should hear about it Rebecca answered I didnt do
anything to be ashamed of I saw the flag in the back of Mr Simpsons
wagon and I just followed it There werent any men or any Dorcases to
take care of it and so it fell to me You wouldnt have had me let it
out of my sight would you and we going to raise it tomorrow morning

Rebeccas perfectly right Mrs Meserve said Miss Dearborn proudly
And its lucky there was somebody quickwitted enough to ride and
consort with Mr Simpson I dont know what the village will think but
seems to me the town clerk might write down in his book THIS DAY THE
STATE OF MAINE SAVED THE FLAG




Sixth Chronicle THE STATE O MAINE GIRL


I

The foregoing episode if narrated in a romance would undoubtedly have
been called The Saving of the Colors but at the nightly conversazione
in Watsons store it was alluded to as the way little Becky Randall got
the flag away from Slippery Simpson

Dramatic as it was it passed into the limbo of halfforgotten things
in Rebeccas mind its brief importance submerged in the glories of the
next day

There was a painful prelude to these glories Alice Robinson came to
spend the night with Rebecca and when the bedroom door closed upon the
two girls Alice announced here intention of doing up Rebeccas front
hair in leads and rags and braiding the back in six tight wetted
braids

Rebecca demurred Alice persisted

Your hair is so long and thick and dark and straight she said that
youll look like an Injun

I am the State of Maine it all belonged to the Indians once Rebecca
remarked gloomily for she was curiously shy about discussing her
personal appearance

And your wreath of little pinecones wont set decent without crimps
continued Alice

Rebecca glanced in the cracked lookingglass and met what she considered
an accusing lack of beauty a sight that always either saddened or
enraged her according to circumstances then she sat down resignedly
and began to help Alice in the philanthropic work of making the State of
Maine fit to be seen at the raising

Neither of the girls was an expert hairdresser and at the end of an
hour when the sixth braid was tied and Rebecca had given one last
shuddering look in the mirror both were ready to weep with fatigue

The candle was blown out and Alice soon went to sleep but Rebecca
tossed on her pillow its goosefeathered softness all dented by the
cruel lead knobs and the knots of twisted rags She slipped out of bed
and walked to and fro holding her aching head with both hands Finally
she leaned on the windowsill watching the still weathervane on
Alices barn and breathing in the fragrance of the ripening apples
until her restlessness subsided under the clear starry beauty of the
night

At six in the morning the girls were out of bed for Alice could hardly
wait until Rebeccas hair was taken down she was so eager to see the
result of her labors

The leads and rags were painfully removed together with much hair the
operation being punctuated by a series of squeaks squeals and shrieks
on the part of Rebecca and a series of warnings from Alice who wished
the preliminaries to be kept secret from the aunts that they might the
more fully appreciate the radiant result

Then came the unbraiding and thendramatic momentthe combing out
a difficult not to say impossible process in which the hairs that had
resisted the earlier stages almost gave up the ghost

The long front strands had been wound up from various angles and by
various methods so that when released they assumed the strangest
most obstinate most unexpected attitudes When the comb was dragged
through the last braid the wild tortured electric hairs following
and then rebounding from it in a bristling snarling tangle
Massachusetts gave one encompassing glance at the State o Maines head
and announced her intention of going home to breakfast She was deeply
grieved at the result of her attempted beautifying but she felt that
meeting Miss Miranda Sawyer at the morning meal would not mend matters
in the least so slipping out of the side door she ran up Guide Board
hill as fast as her legs could carry her

The State o Maine deserted and somewhat unnerved sat down before the
glass and attacked her hair doggedly and with set lips working over it
until Miss Jane called her to breakfast then with a boldness born
of despair she entered the dining room where her aunts were already
seated at table To draw fire she whistled a forbidden joy which
only attracted more attention instead of diverting it There was a
moment of silence after the grotesque figure was fully taken in then
came a moan from Jane and a groan from Miranda

What have you done to yourself asked Miranda sternly

Made an effort to be beautiful and failed jauntily replied Rebecca
but she was too miserable to keep up the fiction Oh Aunt Miranda
dont scold Im so unhappy Alice and I rolled up my hair to curl it
for the raising She said it was so straight I looked like an Indian

Mebbe you did vigorously agreed Miranda but t any rate you looked
like a Christian Injun n now you look like a heathen Injun thats
all the difference I can see What can we do with her Jane between
this and nine oclock

Well all go out to the pump just as soon as were through breakfast
answered Jane soothingly We can accomplish considrable with water and
force

Rebecca nibbled her corncake her tearful eyes cast on her plate and
her chin quivering

Dont you cry and red your eyes up chided Miranda quite kindly the
minute youve eat enough run up and get your brush and comb and meet us
at the back door

I wouldnt care myself how bad I looked said Rebecca but I cant
bear to be so homely that I shame the State of Maine

Oh what an hour followed this plaint Did any aspirant for literary
or dramatic honors ever pass to fame through such an antechamber of
horrors Did poet of the day ever have his head so maltreated To be
dipped in the rainwater tub soused again and again to be held under
the spout and pumped on to be rubbed furiously with rough roller
towels to be dried with hot flannels And is it not wellnigh
incredible that at the close of such an hour the ends of the long hair
should still stand out straight the braids having been turned up two
inches by Alice and tied hard in that position with linen thread

Get out the skirtboard Jane cried Miranda to whom opposition
served as a tonic and move that flatiron on to the front o the
stove Rebecca set down in that low chair beside the board and Jane
you spread out her hair on it and cover it up with brown paper Dont
cringe Rebecca the worsts over and youve borne up real good Ill
be careful not to pull your hair nor scorch you and oh HOW Id like
to have Alice Robinson acrost my knee and a good strip o shingle in my
right hand There youre all ironed out and your Aunt Jane can put on
your white dress and braid your hair up again good and tight Perhaps
you wont be the hombliest of the states after all but when I see you
comin in to breakfast I said to myself I guess if Maine looked like
that it wouldnt never a been admitted into the Union

When Uncle Sam and the stagecoach drew up to the brick house with a
grand swing and a flourish the goddess of Liberty and most of the
States were already in their places on the harricane deck

Words fail to describe the gallant bearing of the horses their
headstalls gayly trimmed and their harnesses dotted with little flags
The stage windows were hung in bunting and from within beamed Columbia
looking out from the bright frame as if proud of her freight of loyal
children Patriotic streamers floated from whip from dashboard and
from rumble and the effect of the whole was something to stimulate the
most phlegmatic voter

Rebecca came out on the steps and Aunt Jane brought a chair to assist in
the ascent Miss Dearborn peeped from the window and gave a despairing
look at her favorite

What had happened to her Who had dressed her Had her head been put
through a wringingmachine Why were her eyes red and swollen Miss
Dearborn determined to take her behind the trees in the pine grove
and give her some finishing touches touches that her skillful fingers
fairly itched to bestow

The stage started and as the roadside pageant grew gayer and gayer
Rebecca began to brighten and look prettier for most of her beautifying
came from within The people walking driving or standing on
their doorsteps cheered Uncle Sams coach with its freight of
gossamermuslined flutteringribboned girls and just behind the
gorgeously decorated haycart driven by Abijah Flagg bearing the jolly
but inharmonious fifeanddrum corps

Was ever such a golden day Such crystal air Such mellow sunshine Such
a merry Uncle Sam

The stage drew up at an appointed spot near a pine grove and while the
crowd was gathering the children waited for the hour to arrive when
they should march to the platform the hour toward which they seemed to
have been moving since the dawn of creation

As soon as possible Miss Dearborn whispered to Rebecca Come behind the
trees with me I want to make you prettier

Rebecca thought she had suffered enough from that process already during
the last twelve hours but she put out an obedient hand and the two
withdrew

Now Miss Dearborn was I fear a very indifferent teacher Dr Moses
always said so and Libbie Moses who wanted her school said it was
a pity she hadnt enjoyed more social advantages in her youth Libbie
herself had taken music lessons in Portland and spent a night at the
Profile House in the White Mountains and had visited her sister in
Lowell Massachusetts These experiences gave her in her own mind and
in the mind of her intimate friends a horizon so boundless that her
view of smaller humbler matters was a trifle distorted

Miss Dearborns stock in trade was small her principal virtues being
devotion to children and ability to gain their love and a power of
evolving a schoolroom order so natural cheery serene and peaceful
that it gave the beholder a certain sense of being in a district heaven
She was poor in arithmetic and weak in geometry but if you gave her a
rose a bit of ribbon and a sevenbynine lookingglass she could make
herself as pretty as a pink in two minutes

Safely sheltered behind the pines Miss Dearborn began to practice
mysterious feminine arts She flew at Rebeccas tight braids opened
the strands and rebraided them loosely bit and tore the red white
and blue ribbon in two and tied the braids separately Then with nimble
fingers she pulled out little tendrils of hair behind the ears and
around the nape of the neck After a glance of acute disapproval
directed at the stiff balloon skirt she knelt on the ground and gave
a strenuous embrace to Rebeccas knees murmuring between her hugs
Starch must be cheap at the brick house

This particular line of beauty attained there ensued great pinchings of
ruffles her fingers that could never hold a ferrule nor snap childrens
ears being incomparable flutingirons

Next the sash was scornfully untied and tightened to suggest something
resembling a waist The chastened bows that had been squat dowdy
spiritless were given tweaks flirts bracing little pokes and dabs
till acknowledging a master hand they stood up piquant pert smart
alert

Pride of bearing was now infused into the flattened lace at the neck
and a pin removed at some sacrifice from her own toilette was darned
in at the back to prevent any cowardly lapsing The short white cotton
gloves that called attention to the tanned wrist and arms were stripped
off and put in her own pocket Then the wreath of pinecones was
adjusted at a heretofore unimagined angle the hair was pulled softly
into a fluffy frame and finally as she met Rebeccas grateful eyes
she gave her two approving triumphant kisses In a second the sensitive
face lighted into happiness pleased dimples appeared in the cheeks the
kissed mouth was as red as a rose and the little fright that had walked
behind the pinetree stepped out on the other side Rebecca the lovely

As to the relative value of Miss Dearborns accomplishments the
decision must be left to the gentle reader but though it is certain
that children should be properly grounded in mathematics no heart of
flesh could bear to hear Miss Dearborns methods vilified who had seen
her patting pulling squeezing Rebecca from ugliness into beauty

The young superintendent of district schools was a witness of the scene
and when later he noted the children surrounding Columbia as bees
a honeysuckle he observed to Dr Moses She may not be much of a
teacher but I think shed be considerable of a wife and subsequent
events proved that he meant what he said

II

Now all was ready the moment of fate was absolutely at hand the
fifeanddrum corps led the way and the States followed but what
actually happened Rebecca never knew she lived through the hours in a
waking dream Every little detail was a facet of light that reflected
sparkles and among them all she was fairly dazzled The brass band
played inspiring strains the mayor spoke eloquently on great themes
the people cheered then the rope on which so much depended was put into
the childrens hands they applied superhuman strength to their task
and the flag mounted mounted smoothly and slowly and slowly unwound
and stretched itself until its splendid size and beauty were revealed
against the maples and pines and blue New England sky

Then after cheers upon cheers and after a patriotic chorus by the church
choirs the State of Maine mounted the platform vaguely conscious
that she was to recite a poem though for the life of her she could not
remember a single word

Speak up loud and clear Rebecky whispered Uncle Sam in the front
row but she could scarcely hear her own voice when tremblingly she
began her first line After that she gathered strength and the poem
said itself while the dream went on

She saw Adam Ladd leaning against a tree Aunt Jane and Aunt Miranda
palpitating with nervousness Clara Belle Simpson gazing crosseyed but
adoring from a seat on the side and in the far far distance on the
very outskirts of the crowd a tall man standing in a wagona tall
loosejointed man with red upturned mustaches and a gaunt white horse
headed toward the Acreville road

Loud applause greeted the state of Maine the slender little whiteclad
figure standing on the mossy boulder that had been used as the centre of
the platform The sun came up from behind a great maple and shone full
on the starspangled banner making it more dazzling than ever so that
its beauty drew all eyes upward

Abner Simpson lifted his vagrant shifting gaze to its softy fluttering
folds and its splendid massing of colors thinking

I dont knows anybodyd ought to steal a flagthe thunderin idjuts
seem to set such store by it and what is it anyway Nothin but a
sheet o buntin

Nothing but a sheet of bunting He looked curiously at the rapt faces
of the mothers their babies asleep in their arms the parted lips and
shining eyes of the whiteclad girls at Capn Lord who had been in
Libby prison and Nat Strout who had left an arm at Bull Run at the
friendly jostling crowd of farmers happy eager absorbed their
throats ready to burst with cheers Then the breeze served and he heard
Rebeccas clear voice saying

For its your star my star all the stars together That make our
countrys flag so proud To float in the bright fall weather

Talk about stars Shes got a couple of em right in her head thought
Simpson If I ever seen a young one like that lyin on anybodys
doorstep Id hook her quickern a wink though Ive got plenty to home
the Lord knows And I wouldnt swap her off neither Spunky little
creeter too settin up in the wagon lookin bouts big as a pint o
cider but keepin right after the goods I vow Im bout sick o my
job Never WITH the crowd allers JEST on the outside s if I want as
goods they be If it paid well mebbe I wouldnt mind but theyre so
thunderin stingy round here they dont leave anything decent out for
you to take from em yet youre reskin your liberty n reputation jest
the same Countin the poor pickins n the time I lose in jail I
might mosts well be done with it n work out by the day as the folks
want me to Id make bouts much n I dont knows it would be any
harder

He could see Rebecca stepping down from the platform while his own
redheaded little girl stood up on her bench waving her hat with one
hand her handkerchief with the other and stamping with both feet

Now a man sitting beside the mayor rose from his chair and Abner heard
him call

Three cheers for the women who made the flag

HIP HIP HURRAH

Three cheers for the State of Maine

HIP HIP HURRAH

Three cheers for the girl that saved the flag from the hands of the
enemy

HIP HIP HURRAH HIP HIP HURRAH

It was the Edgewood minister whose full vibrant voice was of the sort
to move a crowd His words rang out into the clear air and were carried
from lip to lip Hands clapped feet stamped hats swung while the loud
huzzahs might almost have wakened the echoes on old Mount Ossipee

The tall loosejointed man sat down in the wagon suddenly and took up
the reins

Theyre gettin a little mite personal and I guess its bout time for
you to be goin Simpson

The tone was jocular but the red mustaches drooped and the
halfhearted cut he gave to start the white mare on her homeward journey
showed that he was not in his usual devilmaycare mood

Durn his skin he burst out in a vindictive undertone as the mare
swung into her long gait Its a lie I thought twas somebodys wash I
haint an enemy

While the crowd at the raising dispersed in happy family groups to their
picnics in the woods while the Goddess of Liberty Uncle Sam
Columbia and the proud States lunched grandly in the Grange hall with
distinguished guests and scarred veterans of two wars the lonely
man drove and drove and drove through silent woods and dull sleepy
villages never alighting to replenish his wardrobe or his stock of
swapping material

At dusk he reached a miserable tumbledown house on the edge of a pond

The faithful wife with the sad mouth and the habitual look of anxiety in
her faded eyes came to the door at the sound of wheels and went doggedly
to the horseshed to help him unharness

You didnt expect to see me back tonight did ye he asked
satirically leastwise not with this same horse Well Im here You
neednt be scairt to look under the wagon seat there haint nothin
there not even my supper so I hope youre suited for once No I guess
I haint goin to be an angel right away neither There want nothin
but flags layin roun loose down Riverboro way n whatever they say I
haint sech a hound as to steal a flag

It was natural that young Riverboro should have red white and blue
dreams on the night after the new flag was raised A stranger thing
perhaps is the fact that Abner Simpson should lie down on his hard bed
with the flutter of bunting before his eyes and a whirl of unaccustomed
words in his mind

For its your star my star all our stars together

Im sick of goin it alone he thought I guess Ill try the other
road for a spell and with that he fell asleep




Seventh Chronicle THE LITTLE PROPHET


I

I guess York County will never get red of that Simpson crew exclaimed
Miranda Sawyer to Jane I thought when the family moved to Acreville
wed seen the last of em but we aint The big crosseyed stutterin
boy has got a place at the mills in Maplewood thats near enough to
come over to Riverboro once in a while of a Sunday mornin and set in
the meetin house starin at Rebecca same as he used to do only its
reskier now both of em are older Then Mrs Fogg must go and bring back
the biggest girl to help her take care of her babyas if there want
plenty of help nearer home Now I hear say that the youngest twin has
come to stop the summer with the Cames up to Edgewood Lower Corner

I thought two twins were always the same age said Rebecca
reflectively as she came into the kitchen with the milk pail

So they be snapped Miranda flushing and correcting herself But
that pastyfaced Simpson twin looks younger and is smaller than the
other one Hes meek as Moses and the other one is as bold as a brass
kettle I dont see how they come to be twins they aint a mite alike

Elijah was always called the fighting twin at school said Rebecca
and Elishas other name was NimbiPamby but I think hes a nice little
boy and Im glad he has come back He wont like living with Mr Came
but hell be almost next door to the ministers and Mrs Baxter is sure
to let him play in her garden

I wonder why the boys stayin with Cassius Came said Jane To be
sure they havent got any of their own but the childs too young to be
much use

I know why remarked Rebecca promptly for I heard all about it over
to Watsons when I was getting the milk Mr Came traded something with
Mr Simpson two years ago and got the best of the bargain and Uncle
Jerry says hes the only man that ever did and he ought to have a
monument put up to him So Mr Came owes Mr Simpson money and wont
pay it and Mr Simpson said hed send over a child and board part of it
out and take the rest in stocka pig or a calf or something

Thats all stuff and nonsense exclaimed Miranda nothin in the
world but storetalk You git a clump o menfolks settin round
Watsons stove or out on the bench at the door an theyll make up
stories as fast as their tongues can wag The man dont live thats
smart enough to cheat Abner Simpson in a trade and who ever heard of
anybodys owin him money Taint supposable that a woman like Mrs Came
would allow her husband to be in debt to a man like Abner Simpson Its
a sight likelier that she heard that Mrs Simpson was ailin and sent
for the boy so as to help the family along She always had Mrs Simpson
to wash for her once a month if you remember Jane

There are some facts so shrouded in obscurity that the most skillful and
patient investigator cannot drag them into the light of day There are
also but only occasionally certain motives acts speeches lines of
conduct that can never be wholly and satisfactorily explained even in
a village postoffice or on the loafers bench outside the tavern door

Cassius Came was a close man close of mouth and close of purse and all
that Riverboro ever knew as to the three months visit of the Simpson
twin was that it actually occurred Elisha otherwise NimbiPamby came
NimbiPamby stayed and NimbiPamby when he finally rejoined his own
domestic circle did not go emptyhanded so to speak for he was
accompanied on his homeward travels by a large red bony somewhat
truculent cow who was tied on behind the wagon and who made the
journey a lively and eventful one by her total lack of desire to proceed
over the road from Edgewood to Acreville But that the cows tale
belongs to another time and place and the cowards tale must come
first for Elisha Simpson was held to be sadly lacking in the manly
quality of courage

It was the new ministers wife who called NimbiPamby the Little
Prophet His full name was Elisha Jeremiah Simpson but one seldom heard
it at full length since if he escaped the ignominy of NimbiPamby
Lishe was quite enough for an urchin just in his first trousers and
those assumed somewhat prematurely He was Lishe therefore to the
village but the Little Prophet to the young ministers wife

Rebecca could see the Cames brown farmhouse from Mrs Baxters
sittingroom window The littletraveled road with strips of tufted
green between the wheel tracks curled dustily up to the very doorstep
and inside the screen door of pink mosquito netting was a wonderful
drawnin rug shaped like a half pie with Welcome in saffron letters
on a green ground

Rebecca liked Mrs Cassius Came who was a friend of her Aunt Mirandas
and one of the few persons who exchanged calls with that somewhat
unsociable lady The Came farm was not a long walk from the brick house
for Rebecca could go across the fields when hayingtime was over and
her delight at being sent on an errand in that direction could not be
measured now that the new minister and his wife had grown to be such a
resource in her life She liked to see Mrs Came shake the Welcome rug
flinging the cheery word out into the summer sunshine like a bright
greeting to the day She liked to see her go to the screen door a dozen
times in a morning open it a crack and chase an imaginary fly from the
sacred precincts within She liked to see her come up the cellar steps
into the side garden appearing mysteriously as from the bowels of the
earth carrying a shining pan of milk in both hands and disappearing
through the beds of hollyhocks and sunflowers to the pigpen or the
henhouse

Rebecca was not fond of Mr Came and neither was Mrs Baxter nor
Elisha for that matter in fact Mr Came was rather a difficult person
to grow fond of with his fiery red beard his freckled skin and his
gruff way of speaking for there were no children in the brown house to
smooth the creases from his forehead or the roughness from his voice

II

The new ministers wife was sitting under the shade of her great maple
early one morning when she first saw the Little Prophet A tiny figure
came down the grassgrown road leading a cow by a rope If it had been a
small boy and a small cow a middlesized boy and an ordinary cow or a
grown man and a big cow she might not have noticed them but it was the
combination of an infinitesimal boy and a huge cow that attracted her
attention She could not guess the childs years she only knew that he
was small for his age whatever it was

The cow was a dark red beast with a crumpled horn a white star on her
forehead and a large surprised sort of eye She had of course two
eyes and both were surprised but the left one had an added hint of
amazement in it by virtue of a few white hairs lurking accidentally in
the centre of the eyebrow

The boy had a thin sensitive face and curtly brown hair short trousers
patched on both knees and a ragged straw hat on the back of his head
He pattered along behind the cow sometimes holding the rope with both
hands and getting over the ground in a jerky way as the animal left
him no time to think of a smooth path for bare feet

The Came pasture was a good halfmile distant and the cow seemed in no
hurry to reach it accordingly she forsook the road now and then
and rambled in the hollows where the grass was sweeter to her way of
thinking She started on one of these exploring expeditions just as she
passed the ministers great maple and gave Mrs Baxter time to call out
to the little fellow Is that your cow

Elisha blushed and smiled and tried to speak modestly but there was a
quiver of pride in his voice as he answered suggestively

Itsnearly my cow

How is that asked Mrs Baxter

Why Mr Came says when I drive her twentynine more times to pasture
thout her gettin her foot over the rope or thout my bein afraid shes
goin to be my truly cow Are you fraid of cows

Yeees Mrs Baxter confessed I am just a little You see I am
nothing but a woman and boys cant understand how we feel about cows

I can Theyre awful big things arent they

Perfectly enormous Ive always thought a cow coming towards you one of
the biggest things in the world

Yes me too Dont lets think about it Do they hook people so very
often

No indeed in fact one scarcely ever hears of such a case

If they stepped on your bare foot theyd scrunch it wouldnt they

Yes but you are the driver you mustnt let them do that you are a
freewill boy and they are nothing but cows

I know but praps there is freewill cows and if they just WOULD do
it you couldnt help being scrunched for you mustnt let go of the rope
nor run Mr Came says

No of course that would never do

Where you used to live did all the cows go down into the boggy places
when you drove em to pasture or did some walk in the road

There werent any cows or any pastures where I used to live thats
what makes me so foolish why does your cow need a rope

She dont like to go to pasture Mr Came says Sometimes shed druther
stay to home and so when she gets part way she turns round and comes
backwards

Dear me thought Mrs Baxter what becomes of this boymite if the
cow has a spell of going backwardsDo you like to drive her she
asked

Nno not erzackly but you see itll be my cow if I drive her
twentynine more times thout her gettin her foot over the rope and
thout my bein afraid and a beaming smile gave a transient brightness
to his harassed little face Will she feed in the ditch much longer
he asked Shall I say Hurrap Thats what Mr Came saysHURRAP like
that and it means to hurry up

It was rather a feeble warning that he sounded and the cow fed
on peacefully The little fellow looked up at the ministers wife
confidingly and then glanced back at the farm to see if Cassius Came
were watching the progress of events

What shall we do next he asked

Mrs Baxter delighted in that warm cosy little WE it took her into
the firm so pleasantly She was a weak prop indeed when it came to cows
but all the courage in her soul rose to arms when Elisha said What
shall WE do next She became alert ingenious strong on the instant

What is the cows name she asked sitting up straight in the
swingchair

Buttercup but she dont seem to know it very well She aint a mite
like a buttercup

Never mind you must shout Buttercup at the top of your voice and
twitch the rope HARD then Ill call Hurrap with all my might at
the same moment And if she starts quickly we mustnt run nor seem
frightened

They did this it worked to a charm and Mrs Baxter looked
affectionately after her Little Prophet as the cow pulled him down Tory
Hill

The lovely August days wore on Rebecca was often at the parsonage
and saw Elisha frequently but Buttercup was seldom present at their
interviews as the boy now drove her to the pasture very early in the
morning the journey thither being one of considerable length and her
method of reaching the goal being exceedingly roundabout

Mr Came had pointed out the necessity of getting her into the pasture
at least a few minutes before she had to be taken out again at night
and though Rebecca didnt like Mr Came she saw the common sense of
this remark Sometimes Mrs Baxter and Rebecca caught a glimpse of
the two at sundown as they returned from the pasture to the twilight
milking Buttercup chewing her peaceful cud her soft white bag of milk
hanging full her surprised eye rolling in its accustomed fine frenzy
The frenzied roll did not mean anything they used to assure Elisha but
if it didnt it was an awful pity she had to do it Rebecca thought
and Mrs Baxter agreed To have an expression of eye that meant murder
and yet to be a perfectly virtuous and wellmeaning animal this was a
calamity indeed

Mrs Baxter was looking at the sun one evening as it dropped like a ball
of red fire into Wilkinss woods when the Little Prophet passed

Its the twentyninth night he called joyously

I am so glad she answered for she had often feared some accident
might prevent his claiming the promised reward Then tomorrow Buttercup
will be your own cow

I guess so Thats what Mr Came said Hes off to Acreville now but
hell be home tonight and fathers going to send my new hat by him
When Buttercups my own cow I wish I could change her name and call her
Red Rover but praps her mother wouldnt like it When she blongs to
me mebbe I wont be so fraid of gettin hooked and scrunched because
shell know shes mine and shell go better I havent let her get
snarled up in the rope one single time and I dont show Im afraid do
I

I should never suspect it for an instant said Mrs Baxter
encouragingly Ive often envied you your bold brave look

Elisha appeared distinctly pleased I havent cried either when shes
dragged me over the pasture bars and peeled my legs Bill Petess little
brother Charlie says he aint afraid of anything not even bears He
says he would walk right up close and cuff em if they dared to yip
but I aint like that He aint scared of elephants or tigers or lions
either he says theyre all the same as frogs or chickens to him

Rebecca told her Aunt Miranda that evening that it was the Prophets
twentyninth night and that the big red cow was to be his on the
morrow

Well I hope itll turn out that way she said But I aint a mite
sure that Cassius Came will give up that cow when it comes to the point
It wont be the first time hes tried to crawl out of a bargain with
folks a good deal bigger than Lisha for hes terrible close Cassius
is To be sure hes stiff in his joints and hes glad enough to have
a boy to take the cow to the pasture in summer time but he always has
hired help when it comes harvestin So Lishall be no use from this
on and I dare say the cow is Abner Simpsons anyway If you want a walk
tonight I wish youd go up there and ask Mis Came if shell lend me
an your Aunt Jane half her yeastcake Tell her well pay it back when
we get ours a Saturday Dont you want to take Thirza Meserve with you
Shes alone as usual while Huldys entertainin beaux on the side porch
Dont stay too long at the parsonage

III

Rebecca was used to this sort of errand for the whole village of
Riverboro would sometimes be rocked to the very centre of its being by
simultaneous desire for a yeastcake As the nearest repository was a
mile and a half distant as the yeastcake was valued at two cents and
wouldnt keep as the demand was uncertain being dependent entirely on
a fluctuating desire for riz bread the storekeeper refused to order
more than three yeastcakes a day at his own risk Sometimes they
remained on his hands a dead loss sometimes eight or ten persons would
hitch up and drive from distant farms for the coveted article only to
be met with the flat No Im all out o yeastcake Mis Simmons
took the last mebbe you can borry half o hern she haint much of a
breadeater

So Rebecca climbed the hills to Mrs Cames knowing that her daily
bread depended on the successful issue of the call

Thirza was barefooted and tough as her little feet were the long walk
over the stubble fields tired her When they came within sight of the
Came barn she coaxed Rebecca to take a short cut through the turnips
growing in long beautifully weeded rows

You know Mr Came is awfully cross Thirza and cant bear anybody to
tread on his crops or touch a tree or a bush that belongs to him Im
kind of afraid but come along and mind you step softly in between the
rows and hold up your petticoat so you cant possibly touch the turnip
plants Ill do the same Skip along fast because then we wont leave
any deep footprints

The children passed safely and noiselessly along their pleasure a
trifle enhanced by the felt dangers of their progress Rebecca knew that
they were doing no harm but that did not prevent her hoping to escape
the gimlet eye of Mr Came

As they neared the outer edge of the turnip patch they paused suddenly
petticoats in air

A great clump of elderberry bushes hid them from the barn but from the
other side of the clump came the sound of conversation the timid voice
of the Little Prophet and the gruff tones of Cassius Came

Rebecca was afraid to interrupt and too honest to wish to overhear She
could only hope the man and the boy would pass on to the house as they
talked so she motioned to the paralyzed Thirza to take two more steps
and stand with her behind the elderberry bushes But no In a moment
they heard Mr Came drag a stool over beside the grindstone as he said

Well now Elisha Jeremiah well talk about the red cow You say youve
drove her a month do ye And the trade between us was that if you
could drive her a month without her getting the rope over her foot and
without bein afraid you was to have her Thats straight aint it

The Prophets face burned with excitement his gingham shirt rose and
fell as if he were breathing hard but he only nodded assent and said
nothing

Now continued Mr Came have you made out to keep the rope from
under her feet

She aint got tttangled up one ssingle time said Elisha
stuttering in his excitement but looking up with some courage from his
bare toes with which he was assiduously threading the grass

So far so good Now bout bein afraid As you seem so certain of
gettin the cow I suppose you haint been a speck scared hev you
Honor bright now

IInot but just a little mite I

Hold up a minute Of course you didnt SAY you was afraid and didnt
SHOW you was afraid and nobody knew you WAS afraid but that aint the
way we fixed it up You was to call the cow yourn if you could drive
her to the pasture for a month without BEIN afraid Own up square now
hev you ben afraid

A long pause then a faint Yes

Wheres your manners

I mean yes sir

How often If it haint ben too many times mebbe Ill let ye off
though youre a reglar girlboy andll be runnin away from the cat
bimeby Has it bentwice

Yes and the Little Prophets voice was very faint now and had a
decided tear in it

Yes what

Yes sir

Has it ben four times

Yes sir More heaving of the gingham shirt

Well you AIR a thunderin coward How many times Speak up now

More digging of the bare toes in the earth and one premonitory tear
drop stealing from under the downcast lids then

A little most every day and you can keep the cow wailed the
Prophet as he turned abruptly and fled behind the shed where he flung
himself into the green depths of a tansy bed and gave himself up to
unmanly sobs

Cassius Came gave a sort of shamefaced guffaw at the abrupt departure
of the boy and went on into the house while Rebecca and Thirza made
a stealthy circuit of the barn and a polite and circumspect entrance
through the parsonage front gate

Rebecca told the ministers wife what she could remember of the
interview between Cassius Came and Elisha Simpson and tenderhearted
Mrs Baxter longed to seek and comfort her Little Prophet sobbing in the
tansy bed the brand of coward on his forehead and what was much worse
the fear in his heart that he deserved it

Rebecca could hardly be prevented from bearding Mr Came and openly
espousing the cause of Elisha for she was an impetuous reckless
valiant creature when a weaker vessel was attacked or threatened
unjustly

Mrs Baxter acknowledged that Mr Came had been true in a way to his
word and bargain but she confessed that she had never heard of so cruel
and hard a bargain since the days of Shylock and it was all the worse
for being made with a child

Rebecca hurried home her visit quite spoiled and her errand quite
forgotten till she reached the brick house door where she told her
aunts with her customary picturesqueness of speech that she would
rather eat buttermilk bread till she died than partake of food mixed
with one of Mr Cames yeastcakes that it would choke her even in the
shape of good raised bread

Thats all very fine Rebecky said her Aunt Miranda who had a
pinprick for almost every bubble but dont forget theres two other
mouths to feed in this house and you might at least give your aunt and
me the privilege of chokin if we feel to want to

IV

Mrs Baxter finally heard from Mrs Came through whom all information
was sure to filter if you gave it time that her husband despised a
coward that he considered Elisha a regular mothersapronstring boy
and that he was learnin him to be brave

Bill Peters the hired man now drove Buttercup to pasture though
whenever Mr Came went to Moderation or Bonnie Eagle as he often did
Mrs Baxter noticed that Elisha took the hired mans place She often
joined him on these anxious expeditions and a like terror in both
their souls they attempted to train the red cow and give her some idea
of obedience

If she only wouldnt look at us that way we would get along real nicely
with her wouldnt we prattled the Prophet straggling along by her
side and she is a splendid cow she gives twentyone quarts a day and
Mr Came says its moren half cream

The ministers wife assented to all this thinking that if Buttercup
would give up her habit of turning completely round in the road to roll
her eyes and elevate her whitetipped eyebrow she might indeed be an
enjoyable companion but in her present state of development her society
was not agreeable even did she give sixtyone quarts of milk a day
Furthermore when Mrs Baxter discovered that she never did any of these
reprehensible things with Bill Peters she began to believe cows more
intelligent creatures than she had supposed them to be and she was
indignant to think Buttercup could count so confidently on the weakness
of a small boy and a timid woman

One evening when Buttercup was more than usually exasperating Mrs
Baxter said to the Prophet who was bracing himself to keep from being
pulled into a wayside brook where Buttercup loved to dabble Elisha do
you know anything about the superiority of mind over matter

No he didnt though it was not a fair time to ask the question for he
had sat down in the road to get a better purchase on the rope

Well it doesnt signify What I mean is that we can die but once and
it is a glorious thing to die for a great principle Give me that rope
I can pull like an ox in my present frame of mind You run down on the
opposite side of the brook take that big stick wade right inyou
are barefootedbrandish the stick and if necessary do more than
brandish I would go myself but it is better she should recognize you
as her master and I am in as much danger as you are anyway She may
try to hook you of course but you must keep waving the stickdie
brandishing Prophet thats the idea She may turn and run for me in
which case I shall run too but I shall die running and the minister
can bury us under our favorite sweetapple tree

The Prophets soul was fired by the lovely ladys eloquence Their
spirits mounted simultaneously and they were flushed with a splendid
courage in which death looked a mean and paltry thing compared with
vanquishing that cow She had already stepped into the pool but the
Prophet waded in towards her moving the alder branch menacingly She
looked up with the familiar roll of the eye that had done her such good
service all summer but she quailed beneath the stern justice and the
new valor of the Prophets gaze

In that moment perhaps she felt ashamed of the misery she had caused the
helpless mite At any rate actuated by fear surprise or remorse
she turned and walked back into the road without a sign of passion or
indignation leaving the boy and the lady rather disappointed at their
easy victory To be prepared for a violent death and receive not even a
scratch made them fear that they might possibly have overestimated the
danger

They were better friends than ever after that the young ministers wife
and the forlorn little boy from Acreville sent away from home he
knew not why unless it were that there was little to eat there and
considerably more at the Cash Cames as they were called in Edgewood
Cassius was familiarly known as Uncle Cash partly because there was a
disposition in Edgewood to abbreviate all Christian names and partly
because the old man paid cash and expected to be paid cash for
everything

The late summer grew into autumn and the ministers great maple flung
a flaming bough of scarlet over Mrs Baxters swingchair Uncle Cash
found Elisha very useful at picking up potatoes and apples but the boy
was going back to his family as soon as the harvesting was over

One Friday evening Mrs Baxter and Rebecca wrapped in shawls and
fascinators were sitting on Mrs Cames front steps enjoying the
sunset Rebecca was in a tremulous state of happiness for she had
come directly from the Seminary at Wareham to the parsonage and as the
minister was absent at a church conference she was to stay the night
with Mrs Baxter and go with her to Portland next day

They were to go to the Islands have ice cream for luncheon ride on
a horsecar and walk by the Longfellow house a programme that so
unsettled Rebeccas never very steady mind that she radiated flashes
and sparkles of joy making Mrs Baxter wonder if flesh could be
translucent enabling the spiritfires within to shine through

Buttercup was being milked on the grassy slope near the shed door As
she walked to the barn after giving up her pailfuls of yellow milk
she bent her neck and snatched a hasty bite from a pile of turnips lying
temptingly near In her haste she took more of a mouthful than would be
considered good manners even among cows and as she disappeared in the
barn door they could see a forest of green tops hanging from her mouth
while she painfully attempted to grind up the mass of stolen material
without allowing a single turnip to escape

It grew dark soon afterward and they went into the house to see Mrs
Cames new lamp lighted for the first time to examine her last drawnin
rug a wonderful achievement produced entirely from dyed flannel
petticoats and to hear the doctors wife play Oft in the Still
Night on the dulcimer

As they closed the sittingroom door opening on the piazza facing
the barn the women heard the cow coughing and said to one another
Buttercup was too greedy and now she has indigestion

Elisha always went to bed at sundown and Uncle Cash had gone to the
doctors to have his hand dressed for he had hurt it is some way in
the threshingmachine Bill Peters the hired man came in presently and
asked for him saying that the cow coughed more and more and it must
be that something was wrong but he could not get her to open her mouth
wide enough for him to see anything Shed up an die ruther n obleege
anybody that tarnal ugly cow would he said

When Uncle Cash had driven into the yard he came in for a lantern and
went directly out to the barn After a halfhour or so in which the
little party had forgotten the whole occurrence he came in again

Im blamed if we aint goin to lose that cow he said Come out
will ye Hannah and hold the lantern I cant do anything with my right
hand in a sling and Bill is the stupidest critter in the country

Everybody went out to the barn accordingly except the doctors wife
who ran over to her house to see if her brother Moses had come home from
Milltown and could come and take a hand in the exercises

Buttercup was in a bad way there was no doubt of it Something one
of the turnips presumably had lodged in her throat and would move
neither way despite her attempts to dislodge it Her breathing was
labored and her eyes bloodshot from straining and choking Once or
twice they succeeded in getting her mouth partly open but before they
could fairly discover the cause of trouble she had wrested her head
away

I can see a little tuft of green sticking straight up in the middle
said Uncle Cash while Bill Peters and Moses held a lantern on each side
of Buttercups head but land Its so far down and such a mite of a
thing I couldnt git it even if I could use my right hand Spose you
try Bill

Bill hemmed and hawed and confessed he didnt care to try Buttercups
grinders were of good size and excellent quality and he had no fancy
for leaving his hand within her jaws He said he was no good at that
kind of work but that he would help Uncle Cash hold the cows head
that was just as necessary and considerable safer

Moses was more inclined to the service of humanity and did his best
wrapping his wrist in a cloth and making desperate but ineffectual dabs
at the slippery green turniptops in the reluctantly opened throat But
the cow tossed her head and stamped her feet and switched her tail
and wriggled from under Bills hands so that it seemed altogether
impossible to reach the seat of the trouble

Uncle Cash was in despair fuming and fretting the more because of his
own crippled hand

Hitch up Bill he said and Hannah you drive over to Millikens
Mills for the horsedoctor I know we can git out that turnip if we can
hit on the right tools and somebody to manage em right but weve got to
be quick about it or the critterll choke to death sure Your hands so
clumsy Mose she thinks her times come when she feels it in her mouth
and your fingers are so big you cant ketch holt o that green stuff
thout its slippin

Mine aint big let me try said a timid voice and turning round
they saw little Elisha Simpson his trousers pulled on over his
nightshirt his curly hair ruffled his eyes vague with sleep

Uncle Cash gave a laugh of goodhumored derision Youthats afraid
to drive a cow to pasture No sir you haint got sand enough for this
job I guess

Buttercup just then gave a worse cough than ever and her eyes rolled in
her head as if she were giving up the ghost

Id rather do it than see her choke to death cried the boy in
despair

Then by ginger you can try it sonny said Uncle Cash Now this
time well tie her head up Take it slow and make a good job of it

Accordingly they pried poor Buttercups jaws open to put a wooden gag
between them tied her head up and kept her as still as they could
while the women held the lanterns

Now sonny strip up your sleeve and reach as fur downs you can Wind
your little fingers in among that green stuff stickin up there that
aint hardly big enough to call green stuff give it a twist and pull
for all youre worth Land What a skinny little pipe stem

The Little Prophet had stripped up his sleeve It was a slender thing
his arm but he had driven the red cow all summer borne her tantrums
protected her from the consequences of her own obstinacy taking as he
thought a future owners pride in her splendid flow of milkgrown fond
of her in a word and now she was choking to death A skinny little
pipe stem is capable of a deal at such a time and only a slender hand
and arm could have done the work

Elisha trembled with nervousness but he made a dexterous and dashing
entrance into the awful cavern of Buttercups mouth descended upon the
tiny clump of green spills or spikes wound his little fingers in among
them as firmly as he could and then gave a long steady determined
pull with all the strength in this body That was not so much in itself
to be sure but he borrowed a good deal more from some reserve quarter
the location of which nobody knows anything about but upon which
everybody draws in time of need

Such a valiant pull you would never have expected of the Little Prophet
Such a pull it was that to his own utter amazement he suddenly found
himself lying flat on his back on the barn floor with a very slippery
something in his hand and a fairsized but rather dilapidated turnip at
the end of it

Thats the business cried Moses

I could a done it as easy as nothin if my arm had been a leetle mite
smaller said Bill Peters

Youre a trump sonny exclaimed Uncle Cash as he helped Moses untie
Buttercups head and took the gag out

Youre a trump Lisha and by ginger the cows yourn only dont you
let your blessed pa drink none of her cream

The welcome air rushed into Buttercups lungs and cooled her parched
torn throat She was pretty nearly spent poor thing and bent her head
rather gently for her over the Little Prophets shoulder as he threw
his arms joyfully about her neck and whispered Youre my truly cow
now aint you Buttercup

Mrs Baxter dear said Rebecca as they walked home to the parsonage
together under the young harvest moon there are all sorts of cowards
arent there and dont you think Elisha is one of the best kind

I dont quite know what to think about cowards Rebecca Rowena said
the ministers wife hesitatingly The Little Prophet is the third
coward I have known in my short life who turned out to be a hero when
the real testing time came Meanwhile the heroes themselvesor the ones
that were taken for heroeswere always busy doing something or being
somewhere else




Eighth Chronicle ABNER SIMPSONS NEW LEAF


Rebecca had now cut the bonds that bound her to the Riverboro district
school and had been for a week a fullfledged pupil at the Wareham
Seminary towards which goal she had been speeding ever since the
memorable day when she rode into Riverboro on the top of Uncle Jerry
Cobbs stagecoach and told him that education was intended to be the
making of her

She went to and fro with Emma Jane and the other Riverboro boys and
girls on the morning and evening trains that ran between the academy
town and Millikens Mills

The six days had passed like a dreama dream in which she sat in
corners with her eyes cast down flushed whenever she was addressed
stammered whenever she answered a question and nearly died of heart
failure when subjected to an examination of any sort She delighted
the committee when reading at sight from King Lear but somewhat
discouraged them when she could not tell the capital of the United
States She admitted that her former teacher Miss Dearborn might have
mentioned it but if so she had not remembered it

In these first weeks among strangers she passed for nothing but an
interestinglooking timid innocent country child never revealing
even to the farseeing Emily Maxwell a hint of her originality
facility or power in any direction Rebecca was fourteen but so
slight and under the paralyzing new conditions so shy that she
would have been mistaken for twelve had it not been for her general
advancement in the school curriculum

Growing up in the solitude of a remote farm house transplanted to a
tiny village where she lived with two elderly spinsters she was still
the veriest child in all but the practical duties and responsibilities
of life in those she had long been a woman

It was Saturday afternoon her lessons for Monday were all learned and
she burst into the brick house sittingroom with the flushed face and
embarrassed mien that always foreshadowed a request Requests were more
commonly answered in the negative than in the affirmative at the brick
house a fact that accounted for the slight confusion in her demeanor

Aunt Miranda she began the fishman says that Clara Belle Simpson
wants to see me very much but Mrs Fogg cant spare her long at a time
you know on account of the baby being no better but Clara Belle could
walk a mile up and I a mile down the road and we could meet at the
pink house half way Then we could rest and talk an hour or so and both
be back in time for our suppers Ive fed the cat she had no appetite
as its only two oclock and she had her dinner at noon but shell go
back to her saucer and its off my mind I could go down cellar now
and bring up the cookies and the pie and doughnuts for supper before I
start Aunt Jane saw no objection but we thought Id better ask you so
as to run no risks

Miranda Sawyer who had been patiently waiting for the end of this
speech laid down her knitting and raised her eyes with a halfresigned
expression that meant Is there anything unusual in heaven or earth or
the waters under the earth that this child does not want to do Will she
ever settle down to plain comprehensible Sawyer ways or will she to
the end make these sudden and radical propositions suggesting at every
turn the irresponsible Randall ancestry

You know well enough Rebecca that I dont like you to be intimate
with Abner Simpsons young ones she said decisively They aint fit
company for anybody thats got Sawyer blood in their veins if its ever
so little I dont know Im sure how youre goin to turn out The
fish peddler seems to be your best friend without its Abijah Flagg
that youre everlastingly talkin to lately I should think youd
rather read some improvin book than to be chatterin with Squire Beans
choreboy

He isnt always going to be a choreboy explained Rebecca and
thats what were considering Its his career we talk about and he
hasnt got any father or mother to advise him Besides Clara Belle kind
of belongs to the village now that she lives with Mrs Fogg and she
was always the best behaved of all the girls either in school or
Sundayschool Children cant help having fathers

Everybody says Abner is turning over a new leaf and if so the
familyd ought to be encouraged every possible way said Miss Jane
entering the room with her mending basket in hand

If Abner Simpson is turnin over a leaf or anythin else in creation
its only to see whats on the under side remarked Miss Miranda
promptly Dont talk to me about new leaves You cant change that kind
of a man he is what he is and you cant make him no different

The grace of God can do considrable observed Jane piously

I aint sayin but it can if it sets out but it has to begin early and
stay late on a man like Simpson

Now Mirandy Abner aint moren forty I dont know what the average
age for repentance is in menfolks but when you think of what an awful
sight of em leaves it to their deathbeds forty seems real kind
of young Not that Ive heard Abner has experienced religion but
everybodys surprised at the good way hes conductin this fall

Theyll be surprised the other way round when they come to miss their
firewood and apples and potatoes again affirmed Miranda

Clara Belle dont seem to have inherited from her father Jane
ventured again timidly No wonder Mrs Fogg sets such store by the
girl If it hadnt been for her the baby would have been dead by now

Perhaps tryin to save it was interferin with the Lords will was
Mirandas retort

Folks cant stop to figure out just whats the Lords will when a child
has upset a kettle of scalding water on to himself and as she spoke
Jane darned more excitedly Mrs Fogg knows well enough she hadnt
ought to have left that baby alone in the kitchen with the stove even
if she did see Clara Belle comin across lots Shed ought to have
waited before drivin off but of course she was afraid of missing the
train and shes too good a woman to be held accountable

The ministers wife says Clara Belle is a realI cant think of the
word chimed in Rebecca Whats the female of hero Whatever it is
thats what Mrs Baxter called her

Clara Belles the female of Simpson thats what she is Miss Miranda
asserted but shes been brought up to use her wits and I aint sayin
but she used em

I should say she did exclaimed Miss Jane to put that screaming
suffering child in the babycarriage and run all the way to the doctors
when there wasnt a soul on hand to advise her Two or three more such
actions would make the Simpson name sound considrable sweeter in this
neighborhood

Simpson will always sound like Simpson to me vouchsafed the elder
sister but weve talked enough about em an to spare You can go
along Rebecca but remember that a child is known by the company she
keeps

All right Aunt Miranda thank you cried Rebecca leaping from the
chair on which she had been twisting nervously for five minutes And
how does this strike you Would you be in favor of my taking Clara Belle
a companytart

Dont Mrs Fogg feed the young one now shes taken her right into the
family

Oh yes Rebecca answered she has lovely things to eat and Mrs
Fogg wont even let her drink skim milk but I always feel that taking
a present lets the person know youve been thinking about them and are
extra glad to see them Besides unless we have company soon those
tarts will have to be eaten by the family and a new batch made you
remember the one I had when I was rewarding myself last week That was
queerbut nice she added hastily

Mebbe you could think of something of your own you could give away
without taking my tarts responded Miranda tersely the joints of her
armor having been pierced by the fatally keen tongue of her niece who
had insinuated that companytarts lasted a long time in the brick house
This was a fact indeed the companytart was so named not from any
idea that it would ever be eaten by guests but because it was too good
for everyday use

Rebeccas face crimsoned with shame that she had drifted into an
impolite and what was worse an apparently ungrateful speech

I didnt mean to say anything not nice Aunt Miranda she stammered
Truly the tart was splendid but not exactly like new thats all And
oh I know what I can take Clara Belle A few chocolate drops out of the
box Mr Ladd gave me on my birthday

You go down cellar and get that tart same as I told you commanded
Miranda and when you fill it dont uncover a new tumbler of jelly
theres some driedapple preserves open thatll do Wear your rubbers
and your thick jacket After runnin all the way down therefor your
legs never seem to be rigged for walkin like other girlsyoull set
down on some damp stone or other and ketch your death o cold an your
Aunt Jane n Ill be kep up nights nursin you and luggin your meals
upstairs to you on a waiter

 Here Miranda leaned her head against the back of her rocking
chair dropped her knitting and closed her eyes wearily for when the
immovable body is opposed by the irresistible force there is a certain
amount of jar and disturbance involved in the operation

Rebecca moved toward the side door shooting a questioning glance at
Aunt Jane as she passed The look was full of mysterious suggestion and
was accompanied by an almost imperceptible gesture Miss Jane knew that
certain articles were kept in the entry closet and by this time she had
become sufficiently expert in telegraphy to know that Rebeccas unspoken
query meant COULD YOU PERMIT THE HAT WITH THE RED WINGS IT BEING
SATURDAY FINE SETTLED WEATHER AND A PLEASURE EXCURSION

These confidential requests though fraught with embarrassment when
Miranda was in the room gave Jane much secret joy there was something
about them that stirred her spinster heartthey were so gay so
appealing so unSawyer unRiverborolike The longer Rebecca lived in
the brick house the more her Aunt Jane marveled at the child What made
her so different from everybody else Could it be that her graceless
popinjay of a father Lorenzo de Medici Randall had bequeathed her some
strange combination of gifts instead of fortune Her eyes her brows
the color of her lips the shape of her face as well as her ways and
words proclaimed her a changeling in the Sawyer tribe but what an
enchanting changeling bringing wit and nonsense and color and delight
into the gray monotony of the dragging years

There was frost in the air but a bright cheery sun as Rebecca walked
decorously out of the brick house yard Emma Jane Perkins was away over
Sunday on a visit to a cousin in Moderation Alice Robinson and Candace
Milliken were having measles and Riverboro was very quiet Still life
was seldom anything but a gay adventure to Rebecca and she started
afresh every morning to its conquest She was not exacting the Asmodean
feat of spinning a sand heap into twine was poetically speaking always
in her power so the mile walk to the pinkhouse gate and the tryst
with freckled redhaired Clara Belle Simpson whose face Miss Miranda
said looked like a raw pie in a brick oven these commonplace incidents
were sufficiently exhilarating to brighten her eye and quicken her step

As the great bare horsechestnut near the pinkhouse gate loomed into
view the red linseywoolsey speck going down the road spied the
blue linseywoolsey speck coming up and both specks flew over the
intervening distance and meeting embraced each other ardently
somewhat to the injury of the companytart

Didnt it come out splendidly exclaimed Rebecca I was so afraid
the fishman wouldnt tell you to start exactly at two or that one of us
would walk faster than the other but we met at the very spot It was a
very uncommon idea wasnt it Almost romantic

And what do you think asked Clara Belle proudly Look at this Mrs
Fogg lent me her watch to come home by

Oh Clara Belle how wonderful Mrs Fogg gets kinder and kinder to
you doesnt she Youre not homesick any more are you

Noo not really only when I remember theres only little Susan to
manage the twins though theyre getting on real well without me But I
kind of think Rebecca that Im going to be given away to the Foggs for
good

Do you mean adopted

Yes I think fathers going to sign papers You see we cant tell how
many years itll be before the poor baby outgrows its burns and Mrs
Foggll never be the same again and she must have somebody to help
her

Youll be their real daughter then wont you Clara Belle And
Mr Fogg is a deacon and a selectman and a road commissioner and
everything splendid

Yes Ill have board and clothes and school and be named Fogg and
here her voice sank to an awed whisper the upper farm if I should
ever get married Miss Dearborn told me that herself when she was
persuading me not to mind being given away

Clara Belle Simpson exclaimed Rebecca in a transport Whod have
thought youd be a female hero and an heiress besides Its just like
a book story and it happened in Riverboro Ill make Uncle Jerry Cobb
allow there CAN be Riverboro stories you see if I dont

Of course I know its all right Clara Belle replied soberly Ill
have a good home and father cant keep us all but its kind of dreadful
to be given away like a piano or a horse and carriage

Rebeccas hand went out sympathetically to Clara Belles freckled paw
Suddenly her own face clouded and she whispered

Im not sure Clara Belle but Im given away toodo you spose I
am Poor father left us in debt you see I thought I came away from
Sunnybrook to get an education and then help pay off the mortgage but
mother doesnt say anything about my coming back and our familys one
of those toobig ones you know just like yours

Did your mother sign papers to your aunts

If she did I never heard anything about it but theres something
pinned on to the mortgage that mother keeps in the drawer of the
bookcase

Youd know it if twas adoption papers I guess youre just lent Clara
Belle said cheeringly I dont believe anybodyd ever give YOU away
And oh Rebecca fathers getting on so well He works on Dalys farm
where they raise lots of horses and cattle too and he breaks all the
young colts and trains them and swaps off the poor ones and drives
all over the country Daly told Mr Fogg he was splendid with stock
and father says its just like play Hes sent home money three Saturday
nights

Im so glad exclaimed Rebecca sympathetically Now your motherll
have a good time and a black silk dress wont she

I dont know sighed Clara Belle and her voice was grave Ever since
I can remember shes just washed and cried and cried and washed Miss
Dearborn has been spending her vacation up to Acreville you know
and she came yesterday to board next door to Mrs Foggs I heard them
talking last night when I was getting the baby to sleepI couldnt
help it they were so closeand Miss Dearborn said mother doesnt like
Acreville she says nobody takes any notice of her and they dont give
her any more work Mrs Fogg said well they were dreadful stiff and
particular up that way and they liked women to have wedding rings

Hasnt your mother got a wedding ring asked Rebecca astonished
Why I thought everybody HAD to have them just as they do sofas and a
kitchen stove

I never noticed she didnt have one but when they spoke I remembered
mothers hands washing and wringing and she doesnt wear one I know
She hasnt got any jewelry not even a breastpin

Rebeccas tone was somewhat censorious your fathers been so poor
perhaps he couldnt afford breastpins but I should have thought hed
have given your mother a wedding ring when they were married thats the
time to do it right at the very first

They didnt have any real church dressup wedding explained Clara
Belle extenuatingly You see the first mother mine had the big boys
and me and then she died when we were little Then after a while this
mother came to housekeep and she stayed and by and by she was Mrs
Simpson and Susan and the twins and the baby are hers and she and
father didnt have time for a regular wedding in church They dont have
veils and bridesmaids and refreshments round here like Miss Dearborns
sister did

Do they cost a great dealwedding rings asked Rebecca thoughtfully
Theyre solid gold so I spose they do If they were cheap we might
buy one Ive got seventyfour cents saved up how much have you

Fiftythree Clara Belle responded in a depressing tone and anyway
there are no stores nearer than Milltown Wed have to buy it secretly
for I wouldnt make father angry or shame his pride now hes got
steady work and mother would know I had spent all my savings

Rebecca looked nonplussed I declare she said I think the Acreville
people must be perfectly horrid not to call on your mother only because
she hasnt got any jewelry You wouldnt dare tell your father what Miss
Dearborn heard so hed save up and buy the ring

No I certainly would not and Clara Belles lips closed tightly and
decisively

Rebecca sat quietly for a few moments then she exclaimed jubilantly
I know where we could get it From Mr Aladdin and then I neednt tell
him who its for Hes coming to stay over tomorrow with his aunt and
Ill ask him to buy a ring for us in Boston I wont explain anything
you know Ill just say I need a wedding ring

That would be perfectly lovely replied Clara Belle a look of hope
dawning in her eyes and we can think afterwards how to get it over to
mother Perhaps you could send it to father instead but I wouldnt dare
to do it myself You wont tell anybody Rebecca

Cross my heart Rebecca exclaimed dramatically and then with a
reproachful look you know I couldnt repeat a sacred secret like
that Shall we meet next Saturday afternoon and I tell you whats
happenedWhy Clara Belle isnt that Mr Ladd watering his horse at
the foot of the hill this very minute It is and hes driven up from
Milltown stead of coming on the train from Boston to Edgewood Hes all
alone and I can ride home with him and ask him about the ring right
away

Clara Belle kissed Rebecca fervently and started on her homeward
walk while Rebecca waited at the top of the long hill fluttering her
handkerchief as a signal

Mr Aladdin Mr Aladdin she cried as the horse and wagon came
nearer

Adam Ladd drew up quickly at the sound of the eager young voice

Well well here is Rebecca Rowena fluttering along the highroad like a
redwinged blackbird Are you going to fly home or drive with me

Rebecca clambered into the carriage laughing and blushing with delight
at his nonsense and with joy at seeing him again

Clara Belle and I were just talking about you this minute and Im so
glad you came this way for theres something very important to ask you
about she began rather breathlessly

No doubt laughed Adam Ladd who had become in the course of his
acquaintance with Rebecca a sort of high court of appeals I hope the
premium banquet lamp doesnt smoke as it grows older

Now Mr Aladdin you WILL not remember nicely Mr Simpson swapped off
the banquet lamp when he was moving the family to Acreville its not
the lamp at all but once when you were here last time you said youd
make up your mind what you were going to give me for Christmas

Well and I do remember that much quite nicely

Well is it bought

No I never buy Christmas presents before Thanksgiving

Then DEAR Mr Aladdin would you buy me something different something
that I want to give away and buy it a little sooner than Christmas

That depends I dont relish having my Christmas presents given away
I like to have them kept forever in little girls bureau drawers all
wrapped in pink tissue paper but explain the matter and perhaps Ill
change my mind What is it you want

I need a wedding ring dreadfully said Rebecca but its a sacred
secret

Adam Ladds eyes flashed with surprise and he smiled to himself with
pleasure Had he on his list of acquaintances he asked himself a
person of any age or sex so altogether irresistible and unique as this
child Then he turned to face her with the merry teasing look that made
him so delightful to young people

I thought it was perfectly understood between us he said that if
you could ever contrive to grow up and I were willing to wait that I
was to ride up to the brick house on my snow white

Coal black corrected Rebecca with a sparkling eye and a warning
finger

Coal black charger put a golden circlet on your lily white finger
draw you up behind me on my pillion

And Emma Jane too Rebecca interrupted

I think I didnt mention Emma Jane argued Mr Aladdin Three on a
pillion is very uncomfortable I think Emma Jane leaps on the back of a
prancing chestnut and we all go off to my castle in the forest

Emma Jane never leaps and shed be afraid of a prancing chestnut
objected Rebecca

Then she shall have a gentle creamcolored pony but now without any
explanation you ask me to buy you a wedding ring which shows
plainly that you are planning to ride off on a snow whiteI mean coal
blackcharger with somebody else

Rebecca dimpled and laughed with joy at the nonsense In her prosaic
world no one but Adam Ladd played the game and answered the fool
according to his folly Nobody else talked delicious fairystory twaddle
but Mr Aladdin

The ring isnt for ME she explained carefully You know very well
that Emma Jane nor I cant be married till were through Quackenboss
Grammar Greenleafs Arithmetic and big enough to wear long trails and
run a sewing machine The ring is for a friend

Why doesnt the groom give it to his bride himself

Because hes poor and kind of thoughtless and anyway she isnt a bride
any more she has three step and three other kind of children

Adam Ladd put the whip back in the socket thoughtfully and then stooped
to tuck in the rug over Rebeccas feet and his own When he raised his
head again he asked Why not tell me a little more Rebecca Im safe

Rebecca looked at him feeling his wisdom and strength and above all
his sympathy Then she said hesitatingly You remember I told you all
about the Simpsons that day on your aunts porch when you bought the
soap because I told you how the family were always in trouble and how
much they needed a banquet lamp Mr Simpson Clara Belles father has
always been very poor and not always very gooda little bit THIEVISH
you knowbut oh so pleasant and nice to talk to And now hes turning
over a new leaf And everybody in Riverboro liked Mrs Simpson when she
came here a stranger because they were sorry for her and she was so
patient and such a hard worker and so kind to the children But where
she lives now though they used to know her when she was a girl theyre
not polite to her and dont give her scrubbing and washing and Clara
belle heard our teacher say to Mrs Fogg that the Acreville people were
stiff and despised her because she didnt wear a wedding ring like all
the rest And Clara Belle and I thought if they were so mean as that
wed love to give her one and then shed be happier and have more
work and perhaps Mr Simpson if he gets along better will buy her a
breastpin and earrings and shell be fitted out like the others I
know Mrs Peter Meserve is looked up to by everybody in Edgewood on
account of her gold bracelets and moss agate necklace

Adam turned again to meet the luminous innocent eyes that glowed under
the delicate brows and long lashes feeling as he had more than once
felt before as if his worldlywise grownup thoughts had been bathed
in some purifying spring

How shall you send the ring to Mrs Simpson he asked with interest

We havent settled yet Clara Belles afraid to do it and thinks I
could manage better Will the ring cost much Because of course if it
does I must ask Aunt Jane first There are things I have to ask Aunt
Miranda and others that belong to Aunt Jane

It costs the merest trifle Ill buy one and bring it to you and well
consult about it but I think as youre great friends with Mr Simpson
youd better send it to him in a letter letters being your strong
point Its a present a man ought to give his own wife but its worth
trying Rebecca You and Clara Belle can manage it between you and Ill
stay in the background where nobody will see me




Ninth Chronicle THE GREEN ISLE

 Many a green isle needs must be
 In the deep sea of misery
 Or the mariner worn and wan
 Never thus could voyage on
 Day and night and night and day
 Drifting on his weary way

 Shelley


Meantime in these frosty autumn days life was crowded with events in the
lonely Simpson house at Acreville

The tumbledown dwelling stood on the edge of Plineys Pond so called
because old Colonel Richardson left his lands to be divided in five
equal parts each share to be chosen in turn by one of his five sons
Pliny the eldest having priority of choice

Pliny Richardson having little taste for farming and being ardently
fond of fishing rowing and swimming acted up to his reputation
of being a little mite odd and took his whole twenty acres in
waterhence Plinys Pond

The eldest Simpson boy had been working on a farm in Cumberland County
for two years Samuel generally dubbed seesaw had lately found a
humble place in a shingle mill and was partially selfsupporting Clara
Belle had been adopted by the Foggs thus there were only three mouths
to fill the capacious ones of Elijah and Elisha the twin boys and
of lisping nineyearold Susan the capable houseworker and
mothers assistant for the baby had died during the summer died of
discouragement at having been born into a family unprovided with food
or money or love or care or even with desire for or appreciation of
babies

There was no doubt that the erratic father of the house had turned over
a new leaf Exactly when he began or how or why or how long he would
continue the praiseworthy processin a word whether there would be
more leaves turned as the months went onMrs Simpson did not know
and it is doubtful if any authority lower than that of Mr Simpsons
Maker could have decided the matter He had stolen articles for swapping
purposes for a long time but had often avoided detection and always
escaped punishment until the last few years Three fines imposed for
small offenses were followed by several arrests and two imprisonments
for brief periods and he found himself wholly out of sympathy with
the wages of sin Sin itself he did not especially mind but the wages
thereof were decidedly unpleasant and irksome to him He also minded
very much the isolated position in the community which had lately become
his for he was a social being and would ALMOST rather not steal from a
neighbor than have him find it out and cease intercourse This feeling
was working in him and rendering him unaccountably irritable and
depressed when he took his daughter over to Riverboro at the time of the
great flagraising

There are seasons of refreshment as well as seasons of drought in the
spiritual as in the natural world and in some way or other dews
and rains of grace fell upon Abner Simpsons heart during that brief
journey Perhaps the giving away of a child that he could not support
had made the soil of his heart a little softer and readier for planting
than usual but when he stole the new flag off Mrs Peter Meserves
doorsteps under the impression that the cottoncovered bundle
contained freshly washed clothes he unconsciously set certain forces in
operation

It will be remembered that Rebecca saw an inch of red bunting peeping
from the back of his wagon and asked the pleasure of a drive with him
She was no daughter of the regiment but she proposed to follow the
flag When she diplomatically requested the return of the sacred
object which was to be the glory of the raising next day and he thus
discovered his mistake he was furious with himself for having slipped
into a disagreeable predicament and later when he unexpectedly faced
a detachment of Riverboro society at the crossroads and met not only
their wrath and scorn but the reproachful disappointed glance of
Rebeccas eyes he felt degraded as never before

The night at the Centre tavern did not help matters nor the jolly
patriotic meeting of the three villages at the flagraising next
morning He would have enjoyed being at the head and front of the
festive preparations but as he had cut himself off from all such
friendly gatherings he intended at any rate to sit in his wagon on the
very outskirts of the assembled crowd and see some of the gayety for
heaven knows he had little enough he who loved talk and song and
story and laughter and excitement

The flag was raised the crowd cheered the little girl to whom he had
lied the girl who was impersonating the State of Maine was on the
platform speaking her piece and he could just distinguish some of the
words she was saying

For its your star my star all the stars together That makes our
countrys flag so proud To float in the bright fall weather

Then suddenly there was a clarion voice cleaving the air and he saw
a tall man standing in the centre of the stage and heard him crying
THREE CHEERS FOR THE GIRL THAT SAVED THE FLAG FROM THE HANDS OF THE
ENEMY

He was sore and bitter enough already lonely isolated enough with
no lot nor share in the honest community life no hand to shake no
neighbors meal to share and this unexpected public arraignment smote
him between the eyes With resentment newly kindled pride wounded
vanity bleeding he flung a curse at the joyous throng and drove toward
home the home where he would find his ragged children and meet the
timid eyes of a woman who had been the loyal partner of his poverty and
disgraces

It is probable that even then his extremely light hand was already on
the new leaf The angels doubtless were not especially proud of the
matter and manner of his reformation but I dare say they were glad to
count him theirs on any terms so difficult is the reformation of this
blind and foolish world They must have been for they immediately
flung into his very lap a profitable and what is more to the point an
interesting and agreeable situation where money could be earned by doing
the very things his nature craved There were feats of daring to be
performed in sight of admiring and applauding stable boys the horses
he loved were his companions he was OBLIGED to swap for Daly his
employer counted on him to get rid of all undesirable stock power and
responsibility of a sort were given him freely for Daly was no Puritan
and felt himself amply capable of managing any number of Simpsons
so here were numberless advantages within the mans grasp and wages
besides

Abner positively felt no temptation to steal his soul expanded with
pride and the admiration and astonishment with which he regarded
his virtuous present was only equaled by the disgust with which he
contemplated his past not so much a vicious past in his own generous
estimation of it as a thunderin foolish one

Mrs Simpson took the same view of Abners new leaf as the angels
She was thankful for even a brief season of honesty coupled with the
Saturday night remittance and if she still washed and cried and cried
and washed as Clara Belle had always seen her it was either because of
some hidden sorrow or because her poor strength seemed all at once to
have deserted her

Just when employment and good fortune had come to the stepchildren and
her own were better fed and clothed than ever before the pain that had
always lurked constant but dull near her tired heart grew fierce
and triumphantly strong clutching her in its talons biting gnawing
worrying leaving her each week with slighter powers of resistance
Still hope was in the air and a greater content than had ever been hers
was in her eyes a content that came near to happiness when the doctor
ordered her to keep her bed and sent for Clara Belle She could not wash
any longer but there was the ever new miracle of the Saturday night
remittance for household expenses

Is your pain bad today mother asked Clara Belle who only lately
given away was merely borrowed from Mrs Fogg for what was thought to
be a brief emergency

Well there I cant hardly tell Clara Belle Mrs Simpson replied
with a faint smile I cant seem to remember the pain these days
without its extra bad The neighbors are so kind Mrs Little has sent
me canned mustard greens and Mrs Benson chocolate ice cream and mince
pie theres the doctors drops to make me sleep and these blankets
and that great box of eatables from Mr Ladd and you here to keep me
compny I declare Im kind o dazed with comforts I never expected to
see sherry wine in this house I aint never drawed the cork it does
me good enough jest to look at Mr Ladds bottle settin on the
mantelpiece with the fire shinin on the brown glass

Mr Simpson had come to see his wife and had met the doctor just as he
was leaving the house

She looks awful bad to me Is she goin to pull through all right same
as the last time he asked the doctor nervously

Shes going to pull right through into the other world the doctor
answered bluntly and as there dont seem to be anybody else to take
the bull by the horns Id advise you having made the womans life
about as hard and miserable as you could to try and help her to die
easy

Abner surprised and crushed by the weight of this verbal chastisement
sat down on the doorstep his head in his hands and thought a while
solemnly Thought was not an operation he was wont to indulge in and
when he opened the gate a few minutes later and walked slowly toward
the barn for his horse he looked pale and unnerved It is uncommonly
startling first to see yourself in another mans scornful eyes and
then clearly in your own

Two days later he came again and this time it was decreed that he
should find Parson Carll tying his piebald mare at the post

Clara Belles quick eye had observed the minister as he alighted from
his buggy and warning her mother she hastily smoothed the bedclothes
arranged the medicine bottles and swept the hearth

Oh Dont let him in wailed Mrs Simpson all of a flutter at the
prospect of such a visitor Oh dear They must think over to the
village that Im dreadful sick or the minister wouldnt never think
of callin Dont let him in Clara Belle Im afraid he will say hard
words to me or pray to me and I aint never been prayed to since I was
a child Is his wife with him

No hes alone but fathers just drove up and is hitching at the shed
door

Thats worse than all and Mrs Simpson raised herself feebly on her
pillows and clasped her hands in despair You mustnt let them two
meet Clara Belle and you must send Mr Carll away your father
wouldnt have a minister in the house nor speak to one for a thousand
dollars

Be quiet mother Lie down Itll be all right Youll only fret
yourself into a spell The ministers just a good man he wont say
anything to frighten you Fathers talking with him real pleasant and
pointing the way to the front door

The parson knocked and was admitted by the excited Clara Belle who
ushered him tremblingly into the sickroom and then betook herself to
the kitchen with the children as he gently requested her

Abner Simpson left alone in the shed fumbled in his vest pocket and
took out an envelope which held a sheet of paper and a tiny packet
wrapped in tissue paper The letter had been read once before and ran as
follows

Dear Mr Simpson

This is a secret letter I heard that the Acreville people werent nice
to Mrs Simpson because she didnt have any wedding ring like all the
others

I know youve always been poor dear Mr Simpson and troubled with a
large family like ours at the farm but you really ought to have given
Mrs Simpson a ring when you were married to her right at the very
first for then it would have been over and done with as they are solid
gold and last forever And probably she wouldnt feel like asking you
for one because ladies are just like girls only grown up and I know
Id be ashamed to beg for jewelry when just board and clothes cost
so much So I send you a nice new wedding ring to save your buying
thinking you might get Mrs Simpson a bracelet or eardrops for
Christmas It did not cost me anything as it was a secret present from
a friend

I hear Mrs Simpson is sick and it would be a great comfort to her
while she is in bed and has so much time to look at it When I had
the measles Emma Jane Perkins lent me her mothers garnet ring and it
helped me very much to put my wasted hand outside the bedclothes and see
the ring sparkling

Please dont be angry with me dear Mr Simpson because I like you
so much and am so glad you are happy with the horses and colts and I
believe now perhaps you DID think the flag was a bundle of washing
when you took it that day so no more from your Trusted friend Rebecca
Rowena Randall

Simpson tore the letter slowly and quietly into fragments and scattered
the bits on the woodpile took off his hat and smoothed his hair
pulled his mustaches thoughtfully straightened his shoulders and then
holding the tiny packet in the palm of his hand he went round to the
front door and having entered the house stood outside the sickroom for
an instant turned the knob and walked softly in

Then at last the angels might have enjoyed a moment of unmixed joy for
in that brief walk from shed to house Abner Simpsons conscience waked
to life and attained sufficient strength to prick and sting to provoke
remorse to incite penitence to do all sorts of divine and beautiful
things it was meant for but had never been allowed to do

Clara Belle went about the kitchen quietly making preparations for the
childrens supper She had left Riverboro in haste as the change for
the worse in Mrs Simpson had been very sudden but since she had come
she had thought more than once of the wedding ring She had wondered
whether Mr Ladd had bought it for Rebecca and whether Rebecca would
find means to send it to Acreville but her cares had been so many and
varied that the subject had now finally retired to the background of her
mind

The hands of the clock crept on and she kept hushing the strident tones
of Elijah and Elisha opening and shutting the oven door to look at
the corn bread advising Susan as to her dishes and marveling that the
minister stayed so long

At last she heard a door open and close and saw the old parson come
out wiping his spectacles and step into the buggy for his drive to the
village

Then there was another period of suspense during which the house was
as silent as the grave and presently her father came into the kitchen
greeted the twins and Susan and said to Clara Belle Dont go in there
yet jerking his thumb towards Mrs Simpsons room shes all beat out
and shes just droppin off to sleep Ill send some groceries up from
the store as I go along Is the doctor makin a second call tonight

Yes hell be here pretty soon now Clara Belle answered looking at
the clock

All right Ill be here again tomorrow soon as its light and if she
aint picked up any Ill send word back to Daly and stop here with you
for a spell till shes better

It was true Mrs Simpson was all beat out It had been a time of
excitement and stress and the poor fluttered creature was dropping off
into the strangest sleepa sleep made up of waking dreams The pain
that had encompassed her heart like a band of steel lessened its cruel
pressure and finally left her so completely that she seemed to see it
floating above her head only that it looked no longer like a band of
steel but a golden circle

The frail bark in which she had sailed her life voyage had been rocking
on a rough and tossing ocean and now it floated floated slowly into
smoother waters

As long as she could remember her boat had been flung about in storm
and tempest lashed by angry winds borne against rocks beaten torn
buffeted Now the waves had subsided the sky was clear the sea was
warm and tranquil the sunshine dried the tattered sails the air was
soft and balmy

And now for sleep plays strange tricks the bark disappeared from the
dream and it was she herself who was floating floating farther and
farther away whither she neither knew nor cared it was enough to be at
rest lulled by the lapping of the cool waves

Then there appeared a green isle rising from the sea an isle so radiant
and fairylike that her famished eyes could hardly believe its reality
but it was real for she sailed nearer and nearer to its shores and at
last her feet skimmed the shining sands and she floated through the
air as disembodied spirits float till she sank softly at the foot of a
spreading tree

Then she saw the green isle was a flowering isle Every shrub and bush
was blooming the trees were hung with rosy garlands and even the earth
was carpeted with tiny flowers The rare fragrances the bird songs
soft and musical the ravishment of color all bore down upon her
swimming senses at once taking them captive so completely that she
remembered no past was conscious of no present looked forward to no
future She seemed to leave the body and the sad heavy things of the
body The humming in her ears ceased the light faded the birds songs
grew fainter and more distant the golden circle of pain receded farther
and farther until it was lost to view even the flowering island gently
drifted away and all was peace and silence

It was time for the doctor now and Clara Belle too anxious to wait
longer softly turned the knob of her mothers door and entered the
room The glow of the open fire illumined the darkest side of the poor
chamber There were no trees near the house and a full November moon
streamed in at the unblinded uncurtained windows lighting up the bare
interiorthe unpainted floor the gray plastered walls and the white
counterpane

Her mother lay quite still her head turned and drooping a little on
the pillow Her left hand was folded softly up against her breast the
fingers of the right partly covering it as if protecting something
precious

Was it the moonlight that made the patient brow so white and where were
the lines of anxiety and pain The face of the mother who had washed
and cried and cried and washed was as radiant as if the closed eye were
beholding heavenly visions

Something must have cured her thought Clara Belle awed and almost
frightened by the whiteness and the silence

She tiptoed across the floor to look more closely at the still smiling
shape and bending over it saw under the shadow of the caressing right
hand a narrow gold band gleaming on the workstained finger

Oh the ring came after all she said in a glad whisper and perhaps
it was that that made her better

She put her hand on her mothers gently A terrified shiver a warning
shudder shook the girl from head to foot at the chilling touch A dread
presence she had never met before suddenly took shape It filled the
room stifled the cry on her lips froze her steps to the floor stopped
the beating of her heart

Just then the door opened

Oh doctor Come quick she sobbed stretching out her hand for
help and then covering her eyes Come close Look at mother Is she
betteror is she dead

The doctor put one hand on the shoulder of the shrinking child and
touched the woman with the other

She is better he said gently and she is dead




Tenth Chronicle REBECCAS REMINISCENCES


Rebecca was sitting by the window in her room at the Wareham Female
Seminary She was alone as her roommate Emma Jane Perkins was
reciting Latin down below in some academic vault of the old brick
building

A new and most ardent passion for the classics had been born in Emma
Janes hitherto unfertile brain for Abijah Flagg who was carrying off
all the prizes at Limerick Academy had written her a letter in Latin a
letter which she had been unable to translate for herself even with the
aid of a dictionary and which she had been apparently unwilling that
Rebecca her bosom friend confidant and roommate should render into
English

An oldfashioned Female Seminary with its allotment of one mediumsized
room to two medium sized young females gave small opportunities for
privacy by night or day for neither the double washstand nor the thus
far unimagined bathroom nor even indeed the humble and serviceable
screen had been realized in these dark ages of which I write
Accordingly like the irrational ostrich which defends itself by the
simple process of not looking at its pursuers Emma Jane had kept her
Latin letter in her closed hand in her pocket or in her open book
flattering herself that no one had noticed her pleased bewilderment at
its only halfimagined contents

All the fairies were not present at Rebeccas cradle A goodly number of
them telegraphed that they were previously engaged or unavoidably absent
from town The village of Temperance Maine where Rebecca first saw the
light was hardly a place on its own merits to attract large throngs of
fairies But one dear old personage who keeps her pocket full of Merry
Leaves from the Laughing Tree took a fancy to come to the little
birthday party and seeing so few of her sisterfairies present she
dowered the sleeping baby more richly than was her wont because of its
apparent lack of wealth in other directions So the child grew and the
Merry Leaves from the Laughing Tree rustled where they hung from the
hood of her cradle and being fairy leaves when the cradle was
given up they festooned themselves on the cribside and later on blew
themselves up to the ceilings at Sunnybook Farm and dangled there
making fun for everybody They never withered even at the brick house
in Riverboro where the air was particularly inimical to fairies
for Miss Miranda Sawyer would have scared any ordinary elf out of her
seventeen senses They followed Rebecca to Wareham and during Abijah
Flaggs Latin correspondence with Emma Jane they fluttered about that
young persons head in such a manner that Rebecca was almost afraid that
she would discover them herself although this is something as a matter
of fact that never does happen

A week had gone by since the Latin missive had been taken from
the postoffice by Emma Jane and now by means of much midnight
oilburning by much cautious questioning of Miss Maxwell by such
scrutiny of the moods and tenses of Latin verbs as wellnigh destroyed
her brain tissue she had mastered its romantic message If it was
conventional in style Emma Jane never suspected it If some of the
similes seemed to have been culled from the Latin poets and some of the
phrases built up from Latin exercises Emma Jane was neither scholar
nor critic the similes the phrases the sentiments when finally
translated and written down in blackandwhite English made in her
opinion the most convincing and heartmelting document ever sent
through the mails

Mea cara Emma

Cur audeo scribere ad te epistulam Es mihi dea Semper es in mea anima
Iterum et iterum es cum me in somnis Saepe video tuas capillos auri
tuos pulchros oculos similes caelo tuas genas quasi rubentes rosas
in nive Tua vox est dulcior quam cantus avium aut murmur rivuli in
montibus

Cur sum ego tam miser et pauper et indignus et tu tam dulcis et bona et
nobilis

Si cogitabis de me ero beatus Tu es sola puella quam amo et semper
eris Alias puellas non amavi Forte olim amabis me sed sum indignus
Sine te sum miser cum tu es prope mea vita omni est goddamn

Vale carissima carissima puella

De tuo fideli servo AF

My dear Emma

Why dare I write to you a letter You are to me a goddess Always you
are in my heart Again and again you are with me in dreams Often I see
your locks of gold your beautiful eyes like the sky your cheeks as
red roses in snow Your voice is sweeter than the singing of birds or
the murmur of the stream in the mountains

Why am I so wretched and poor and unworthy and you so sweet and good
and noble

If you will think of me I shall be happy You are the only girl that I
love and always will be Other girls I have not loved Perhaps sometime
you will love me but I am unworthy Without you I am wretched when
you are near my life is all joy

Farewell dearest dearest girl

From your faithful slave AF

Emma Jane knew the letter by heart in English She even knew it in
Latin only a few days before a dead language to her but now one filled
with life and meaning From beginning to end the epistle had the effect
upon her as of an intoxicating elixir Often at morning prayers or
while eating her rice pudding at the noon dinner or when sinking off
to sleep at night she heard a voice murmuring in her ear Vale
carissima carissima puella As to the effect on her modest
countrified little heart of the phrases in which Abijah stated she was
a goddess and he her faithful slave that quite baffles description for
it lifted her bodily out of the scenes in which she moved into a new
rosy ethereal atmosphere in which even Rebecca had no place

Rebecca did not know this fortunately she only suspected and waited
for the day when Emma Jane would pour out her confidences as she always
did and always would until the end of time At the present moment
she was busily employed in thinking about her own affairs A shabby
composition book with mottled board covers lay open on the table before
her and sometimes she wrote in it with feverish haste and absorption
and sometimes she rested her chin in the cup of her palm and with the
pencil poised in the other hand looked dreamily out on the village its
huddle of roofs and steeples all blurred into positive beauty by the
fastfalling snowflakes

It was the middle of December and the friendly sky was softly dropping
a great white mantle of peace and goodwill over the little town making
all ready within and without for the Feast o the Babe

The main street that in summer was made dignified by its splendid
avenue of shade trees now ran quiet and white between rows of stalwart
trunks whose leafless branches were all hanging heavy under their
dazzling burden

The path leading straight up the hill to the Academy was broken only by
the feet of the hurrying breathless boys and girls who ran up and down
carrying piles of books under their arms books which they remembered
so long as they were within the four walls of the recitation room and
which they eagerly forgot as soon as they met one another in the living
laughing world going up and down the hill

Its very becoming to the universe snow is thought Rebecca looking
out of the window dreamily Really theres little to choose between the
world and heaven when a snowstorm is going on I feel as if I ought to
look at it every minute I wish I could get over being greedy but it
still seems to me at sixteen as if there werent waking hours enough
in the day and as if somehow I were pressed for time and continually
losing something How well I remember mothers story about me when I
was four It was at early breakfast on the farm but I called all meals
dinner then and when I had finished I folded up my bib and sighed O
dear Only two more dinners play a while and go to bed This was at
six in the morninglamplight in the kitchen snowlight outside

 Powdery powdery powdery snow
 Making things lovely wherever you go
 Merciful merciful merciful snow
 Masking the ugliness hidden below

Herbert made me promise to do a poem for the January Pilot but I
mustnt take the snow as a subject there has been too great competition
among the older poets And with that she turned in her chair and began
writing again in the shabby book which was already three quarters
filled with childish scribblings sometimes in pencil and sometimes in
violet ink with carefully shaded capital letters

    

Squire Bean has had a sharp attack of rheumatism and Abijah Flagg came
back from Limerick for a few days to nurse him One morning the Burnham
sisters from North Riverboro came over to spend the day with Aunt
Miranda and Abijah went down to put up their horse Commodatin
Bijah was his pet name when we were all young

He scaled the ladder to the barn chamberthe dear old ladder that
used to be my safety valveand pitched down the last forkful of
grandfathers hay that will ever be eaten by any visiting horse They
WILL be delighted to hear that it is all gone they have grumbled at it
for years and years

What should Abijah find at the bottom of the heap but my Thought Book
hidden there two or three years ago and forgotten

When I think of what it was to me the place it filled in my life the
affection I lavished on it I wonder that I could forget it even in
all the excitement of coming to Wareham to school And that gives me
an uncommon thought as I used to say It is this that when we finish
building an air castle we seldom live in it after all we sometimes even
forget that we ever longed to Perhaps we have gone so far as to
begin another castle on a higher hilltop and this is so
beautifulespecially while we are building and before we live in
itthat the first one has quite vanished from sight and mind like the
outgrown shell of the nautilus that he casts off on the shore and never
looks at again At least I suppose he doesnt but perhaps he takes one
backward glance halfsmiling halfserious just as I am doing at my
old Thought Book and says WAS THAT MY SHELL GOODNESS GRACIOUS HOW
DID I EVER SQUEEZE MYSELF INTO IT

That bit about the nautilus sounds like an extract from a school theme
or a Pilot editorial or a fragment of one of dear Miss Maxwells
lectures but I think girls of sixteen are principally imitations of the
people and things they love and admire and between editing the Pilot
writing out Virgil translations searching for composition subjects and
studying rhetorical models there is very little of the original
Rebecca Rowena about me at the present moment I am just a member of
the graduating class in good and regular standing We do our hair alike
dress alike as much as possible eat and drink alike talk alikeI am
not even sure that we do not think alike and what will become of the
poor world when we are all let loose upon it on the same day of June
Will life real life bring our true selves back to us Will love and
duty and sorrow and trouble and work finally wear off the school stamp
that has been pressed upon all of us until we look like rows of shining
copper cents fresh from the mint

Yet there must be a little difference between us somewhere or why does
Abijah Flagg write Latin letters to Emma Jane instead of to me There
is one example on the other side of the argumentAbijah Flagg He
stands out from all the rest of the boys like the Rock of Gibraltar in
the geography pictures Is it because he never went to school until he
was sixteen He almost died of longing to go and the longing seemed to
teach him more than going He knew his letters and could read simple
things but it was I who taught him what books really meant when I was
eleven and he thirteen We studied while he was husking corn or cutting
potatoes for seed or shelling beans in the Squires barn His beloved
Emma Jane didnt teach him her father wold not have let her be friends
with a choreboy It was I who found him after milkingtime summer
nights suffering yes dying of Least Common Multiple and Greatest
Common Divisor I who struck the shackles from the slave and told him to
skip it all and go on to something easier like Fractions Percentage
and Compound Interest as I did myself Oh How he used to smell of the
cows when I was correcting his sums on warm evenings but I dont regret
it for he is now the joy of Limerick and the pride of Riverboro and I
suppose has forgotten the proper side on which to approach a cow if you
wish to milk her This now unserviceable knowledge is neatly inclosed in
the outgrown shell he threw off two or three years ago His gratitude
to me knows no bounds buthe writes Latin letters to Emma Jane But as
Mr Perkins said about drowning the kittens I now quote from myself at
thirteen It is the way of the world and how things have to be

Well I have read the Thought Book all through and when I want to
make Mr Aladdin laugh I shall show him my composition on the relative
values of punishment and reward as builders of character

I am not at all the same Rebecca today at sixteen that I was then
at twelve and thirteen I hope in getting rid of my failings that I
havent scrubbed and rubbed so hard that I have taken the gloss off the
poor little virtues that lay just alongside of the faults for as I read
the foolish doggerel and the funny funny Remerniscences I see on the
whole a nice wellmeaning trusting loving heedless little creature
that after all Id rather build on than outgrow altogether because she
is Me the Me that was made and born just a little different from all
the rest of the babies in my birthday year

One thing is alike in the child and the girl They both love to set
thoughts down in black and white to see how they look how they sound
and how they make one feel when one reads them over

They both love the sound of beautiful sentences and the tinkle of
rhyming words and in fact of the three great Rs of life they adore
Reading and Riting as much as they abhor Rithmetic

The little girl in the old book is always thinking of what she is going
to be

Uncle Jerry Cobb spoiled me a good deal in this direction I remember
he said to everybody when I wrote my verses for the flagraising Nary
rung on the ladder o fame but that childll climb if you give her
timepoor Uncle Jerry He will be so disappointed in me as time goes
on And still he would think I have already climbed two rungs on the
ladder although it is only a little Wareham ladder for I am one of
the Pilot editors the first girl editorand I have taken a fifty
dollar prize in composition and paid off the interest on a twelve
hundred dollar mortgage with it

 High is the rank we now possess
 But higher we shall rise
 Though what we shall hereafter be
 Is hid from mortal eyes

This hymn was sung in meeting the Sunday after my election and Mr
Aladdin was there that day and looked across the aisle and smiled at me
Then he sent me a sheet of paper from Boston the next morning with just
one verse in the middle of it

She made the cleverest people quite ashamed And evn the good with
inward envy groan Finding themselves so very much exceeded In their
own way by all the things that she did

Miss Maxwell says it is Byron and I wish I had thought of the last
rhyme before Byron did my rhymes are always so common

I am too busy doing nowadays to give very much thought to being
Mr Aladdin was teasing me one day about what he calls my castoff
careers

What makes you aim at any mark in particular Rebecca he asked
looking at Miss Maxwell and laughing Women never hit what they aim at
anyway but if they shut their eyes and shoot in the air they generally
find themselves in the bulls eye

I think one reason that I have always dreamed of what I should be when
I grew up was that even before father died mother worried about the
mortgage on the farm and what would become of us if it were foreclosed

It was hard on children to be brought up on a mortgage that way but
oh it was harder still on poor dear mother who had seven of us then
to think of and still has three at home to feed and clothe out of the
farm

Aunt Jane says I am young for my age Aunt Miranda is afraid that I will
never really grow up Mr Aladdin says that I dont know the world any
better than the pearl inside of the oyster They none of them know the
old old thoughts I have some of them going back years and years for
they are never ones that I can speak about

I remember how we children used to admire father he was so handsome and
graceful and amusing never cross like mother or too busy to play with
us He never did any work at home because he had to keep his hands nice
for playing the church melodeon or the violin or piano for dances

Mother used to say Hannah and Rebecca you must hull the strawberries
your father cannot help John you must milk next year for I havent
the time and it would spoil your fathers hands

All the other men in Temperance village wore calico or flannel shirts
except on Sundays but Father never wore any but white ones with
starched bosoms He was very particular about them and mother used to
stitch and stitch on the pleats and press and press the bosoms and
collar and cuffs sometimes late at night

Then she was tired and thin and gray with no time to sew on new dresses
for herself and no time to wear them because she was always taking
care of the babies and father was happy and well and handsome But
we children never thought much about it until once after father had
mortgaged the farm there was going to be a sociable in Temperance
village Mother could not go as Jenny had whoopingcough and Mark had
just broken his arm and when she was tying fathers necktie the last
thing before he started he said I wish Aurelia that you cared a
little about YOUR appearance and YOUR dress it goes a long way with a
man like me

Mother had finished the tie and her hands dropped suddenly I looked at
her eyes and mouth while she looked at father and in a minute I was ever
so old with a grownup ache in my heart It has always stayed there
although I admired my handsome father and was proud of him because he
was so talented but now that I am older and have thought about things
my love for mother is different from what it used to be Father was
always the favorite when we were little he was so interesting and
I wonder sometimes if we dont remember interesting people longer and
better than we do those who are just good and patient If so it seems
very cruel

As I look back I see that Miss Ross the artist who brought me my
pink parasol from Paris sowed the first seeds in me of ambition to do
something special Her life seemed so beautiful and so easy to a child
I had not been to school then or read George Macdonald so I did not
know that Ease is the lovely result of forgotten toil

Miss Ross sat out of doors and painted lovely things and everybody said
how wonderful they were and bought them straight away and she took
care of a blind father and two brothers and traveled wherever she
wished It comes back to me now that summer when I was ten and Miss
Ross painted me sitting by the millwheel while she talked to me of
foreign countries

The other day Miss Maxwell read something from Brownings poems to the
girls of her literature class It was about David the shepherd boy
who used to lie in his hollow watching one eagle wheeling slow as in
sleep He used to wonder about the wide world that the eagle beheld
the eagle that was stretching his wings so far up in the blue while he
the poor shepherd boy could see only the strip twixt the hill and the
sky for he lay in a hollow

I told Mr Baxter about it the next day which was the Saturday before
I joined the church I asked him if it was wicked to long to see as much
as the eagle saw

There was never anybody quite like Mr Baxter Rebecca dear he said
it may be that you need not always lie in a hollow as the shepherd boy
did but wherever you lie that little strip you see twixt the hill
and the sky is able to hold all of earth and all of heaven if only you
have the right sort of vision

I was a long long time about experiencing religion I remember Sunday
afternoons at the brick house the first winter after I went there when
I used to sit in the middle of the diningroom as I was bid silent and
still with the big family Bible on my knees Aunt Miranda had Baxters
Saints Rest but her seat was by the window and she at least could
give a glance into the street now and then without being positively
wicked

Aunt Jane used to read the Pilgrims Progress The fire burned low
the tall clock ticked ticked so slowly and steadily that the pictures
swam before my eyes and I almost fell asleep

They thought by shutting everything else out that I should see God
but I didnt not once I was so homesick for Sunnybook and John that
I could hardly learn my weekly hymns especially the sad long one
beginning

 My thoughts on awful subjects roll
 Damnation and the dead

It was brother John for whom I was chiefly homesick on Sunday
afternoons because at Sunnybrook Farm father was dead and mother was
always busy and Hannah never liked to talk

Then the next year the missionaries from Syria came to Riverboro and
at the meeting Mr Burch saw me playing the melodeon and thought I was
grown up and a church member and so he asked me to lead in prayer

I didnt dare to refuse and when I prayed which was just like thinking
out loud I found I could talk to God a great deal easier than to Aunt
Miranda or even to Uncle Jerry Cobb There were things I could say to
Him that I could never say to anybody else and saying them always made
me happy and contented

When Mr Baxter asked me last year about joining the church I told him
I was afraid I did not understand God quite well enough to be a real
member

So you dont quite understand God Rebecca he asked smiling
Well there is something else much more important which is that
He understands you He understands your feeble love your longings
desires hopes faults ambitions crosses and that after all is what
counts Of course you dont understand Him You are overshadowed by His
love His power His benignity His wisdom that is as it should be
Why Rebecca dear if you could stand erect and unabashed in Gods
presence as one who perfectly comprehended His nature or His purposes
it would be sacrilege Dont be puzzled out of your blessed inheritance
of faith my child accept God easily and naturally just as He accepts
you

God never puzzled me Mr Baxter it isnt that I said but the
doctrines do worry me dreadfully

Let them alone for the present Mr Baxter said Anyway Rebecca you
can never prove God you can only find Him

Then do you think I have really experienced religion Mr Baxter I
asked Am I the beginnings of a Christian

You are a dear child of the understanding God Mr Baxter said and I
say it over to myself night and morning so that I can never forget it

    

The year is nearly over and the next few months will be lived in the
rush and whirlwind of work that comes before graduation The bell for
philosophy class will ring in ten minutes and as I have been writing
for nearly two hours I must learn my lesson going up the Academy
hill It will not be the first time it is a grand hill for learning I
suppose after fifty years or so the very ground has become soaked with
knowledge and every particle of air in the vicinity is crammed with
useful information

I will put my book into my trunk having no blessed haymow hereabouts
and take it out againwhen shall I take it out again

After graduation perhaps I shall be too grown up and too busy to write
in a Thought Book but oh if only something would happen worth putting
down something strange something unusual something different from the
things that happen every day in Riverboro and Edgewood

Graduation will surely take me a little out of the hollowmake me
a little more like the soaring eagle gazing at the whole wide world
beneath him while he wheels slow as in sleep But whether or not
Ill try not to be a discontented shepherd but remember what Mr Baxter
said that the little strip that I see twixt the hill and the sky is
able to hold all of earth and all of heaven if only I have the eyes to
see it

Wareham Female Seminary December 187




Eleventh Chronicle ABIJAH THE BRAVE AND THE FAIR EMMAJANE


I

 A warrior so bold and a maiden so bright
 Conversed as they sat on the green
 They gazed at each other in tender delight
 Alonzo the brave was the name of the knight
 And the maid was the fair Imogene

 Alas said the youth since tomorrow I go
 To fight in a far distant land
 Your tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow
 Some other will court you and you will bestow
 On a wealthier suitor your hand

 Oh hush these suspicions Fair Imogene said
 So hurtful to love and to me
 For if you be living or if you be dead
 I swear by the Virgin that none in your stead
 Shall the husband of Imogene be

Ever since she was eight years old Rebecca had wished to be eighteen
but now that she was within a month of that aweinspiring and
longdesired age she wondered if after all it was destined to be a
turning point in her quiet existence Her eleventh year for instance
had been a real turningpoint since it was then that she had left
Sunnybrook Farm and come to her maiden aunts in Riverboro Aurelia
Randall may have been doubtful as to the effect upon her spinster
sisters of the irrepressible child but she was hopeful from the first
that the larger opportunities of Riverboro would be the making of
Rebecca herself

The next turningpoint was her fourteenth year when she left the
district school for the Wareham Female Seminary then in the heyday
of its local fame Graduation next to marriage perhaps the most
thrilling episode in the life of a little country girl happened at
seventeen and not long afterward her Aunt Mirandas death sudden and
unexpected changed not only all the outward activities and conditions
of her life but played its own part in her development

The brick house looked very homelike and pleasant on a June morning
nowadays with childrens faces smiling at the windows and youthful
footsteps sounding through the halls and the brass knocker on the
redpainted front door might have remembered Rebeccas prayer of a year
before when she leaned against its sunwarmed brightness and whispered
God bless Aunt Miranda God bless the brick house that was God bless
the brick house thats going to be

All the doors and blinds were open to the sun and air as they had never
been in Miss Miranda Sawyers time The hollyhock bed that had been her
chief pride was never neglected and Rebecca liked to hear the neighbors
say that there was no such row of beautiful plants and no such variety
of beautiful colors in Riverboro as those that climbed up and peeped in
at the kitchen windows where old Miss Miranda used to sit

Now that the place was her very own Rebecca felt a passion of pride in
its smoothly mown fields its carefully thinnedout woods its blooming
garden spots and its wellweeded vegetable patch felt too whenever
she looked at any part of it a passion of gratitude to the stern old
aunt who had looked upon her as the future head of the family as well
as a passion of desire to be worthy of that trust

It had been a very difficult year for a girl fresh from school the
death of her aunt the nursing of Miss Jane prematurely enfeebled by
the shock the removal of her own invalid mother and the rest of the
little family from Sunnybrook Farm But all had gone smoothly and when
once the Randall fortunes had taken an upward turn nothing seemed able
to stop their intrepid ascent

Aurelia Randall renewed her youth in the companionship of her sister
Jane and the comforts by which her children were surrounded the
mortgage was no longer a daily terror for Sunnybrook had been sold to
the new railroad Hannah now Mrs Will Melville was happily situated
John at last was studying medicine Mark the boisterous and unlucky
brother had broken no bones for several months while Jenny and Fanny
were doing well at the district school under Miss Libby Moses Miss
Dearborns successor

I dont feel very safe thought Rebecca remembering all these
unaccustomed mercies as she sat on the front doorsteps with her tatting
shuttle flying in and out of the fine cotton like a hummingbird Its
just like one of those too beautiful July days that winds up with a
thundershower before night Still when you remember that the Randalls
never had anything but thunder and lightning rain snow and hail in
their family history for twelve or fifteen years perhaps it is only
natural that they should enjoy a little spell of settled weather If it
really turns out to BE settled now that Aunt Jane and mother are strong
again I must be looking up one of what Mr Aladdin calls my castoff
careersThere comes Emma Jane Perkins through her front gate she
will be here in a minute and Ill tease her and Rebecca ran in the
door and seated herself at the old piano that stood between the open
windows in the parlor

Peeping from behind the muslin curtains she waited until Emma Jane
was on the very threshold and then began singing her version of an old
ballad made that morning while she was dressing The ballad was a great
favorite of hers and she counted on doing telling execution with it in
the present instance by the simple subterfuge of removing the original
hero and heroine Alonzo and Imogene and substituting Abijah the Brave
and the Fair Emmajane leaving the circumstances in the first three
verses unaltered because in truth they seemed to require no alteration

Her high clear voice quivering with merriment floated through the
windows into the still summer air

 A warrior so bold and a maiden so bright
 Conversed as they sat on the green
 They gazed at each other in tender delight
 Abijah the Brave was the name of the knight
 And the maid was the Fair Emmajane

Rebecca Randall stop Somebodyll hear you

No they wonttheyre making jelly in the kitchen miles away

 Alas said the youth since tomorrow I go
 To fight in a far distant land
 Your tears for my absence soon ceasing to flow
 Some other will court you and you will bestow
 On a wealthier suitor your hand

Rebecca you cant THINK how your voice carries I believe mother can
hear it over to my house

Then if she can I must sing the third verse just to clear your
reputation from the cloud cast upon it in the second laughed her
tormentor going on with the song

Oh hush these suspicions Fair Emmajane said So hurtful to love
and to me For if you be living or if you be dead I swear my Abijah
that none in your stead Shall the husband of Emmajane be

After ending the third verse Rebecca wheeled around on the piano
stool and confronted her friend who was carefully closing the parlor
windows

Emma Jane Perkins it is an ordinary Thursday afternoon at four oclock
and you have on your new blue barege although there is not even a
church sociable in prospect this evening What does this mean Is Abijah
the Brave coming at last

I dont know certainly but it will be some time this week

And of course youd rather be dressed up and not seen than seen when
not dressed up Right my Fair Emmajane so would I Not that it makes
any difference to poor me wearing my fourth best black and white calico
and expecting nobody

Oh well YOU Theres something inside of you that does instead of
pretty dresses cried Emma Jane whose adoration of her friend had
never altered nor lessened since they met at the age of eleven You
know you are as different from anybody else in Riverboro as a princess
in a fairy story Libby Moses says they would notice you in Lowell
Massachusetts

Would they I wonder speculated Rebecca rendered almost speechless
by this tribute to her charms Well if Lowell Massachusetts could
see me or if you could see me in my new lavender muslin with the
violet sash it would die of envy and so would you

If I had been going to be envious of you Rebecca I should have died
years ago Come lets go out on the steps where its shady and cool

And where we can see the Perkins front gate and the road running both
ways teased Rebecca and then softening her tone she said How
is it getting on Emmy Tell me whats happened since Ive been in
Brunswick

Nothing much confessed Emma Jane He writes to me but I dont write
to him you know I dont dare to till he comes to the house

Are his letters still in Latin asked Rebecca with a twinkling eye

Oh no Not now becausewell because there are things you cant seem
to write in Latin I saw him at the Masonic picnic in the grove but he
wont say anything REAL to me till he gets more pay and dares to speak
to mother and father He IS brave in all other ways but I aint sure
hell ever have the courage for that hes so afraid of them and always
has been Just remember whats in his mind all the time Rebecca that
my folks know all about what his mother was and how he was born on the
poorfarm Not that I care look how hes educated and worked himself
up I think hes perfectly elegant and I shouldnt mind if he had been
born in the bulrushes like Moses

Emma Janes everyday vocabulary was pretty much what it had been before
she went to the expensive Wareham Female Seminary She had acquired
a certain amount of information concerning the art of speech but in
moments of strong feeling she lapsed into the vernacular She grew
slowly in all directions did Emma Jane and to use Rebeccas favorite
nautilus figure she had left comparatively few outgrown shells on the
shores of lifes unresting sea

Moses wasnt born in the bulrushes Emmy dear corrected Rebecca
laughingly Pharaohs daughter found him there It wasnt quite as
romantic a sceneSquire Beans wife taking little Abijah Flagg from the
poorhouse when his girlmother died but oh I think Abijahs splendid
Mr Ladd says Riverboroll be proud of him yet and I shouldnt wonder
Emmy dear if you had a threestory house with a cupola on it some day
and sitting down at your mahogany desk inlaid with garnets you will
write notes stating that Mrs Abijah Flagg requests the pleasure of Miss
Rebecca Randalls company to tea and that the Hon Abijah Flagg MC
will call for her on his way from the station with a span of horses and
the turquoise carryall

Emma Jane laughed at the ridiculous prophecy and answered If I ever
write the invitation I shant be addressing it to Miss Randall Im sure
of that itll be to Mrs

Dont cried Rebecca impetuously changing color and putting her hand
over Emma Janes lips If you wont Ill stop teasing I couldnt bear
a name put to anything I couldnt Emmy dear I wouldnt tease you
either if it werent something weve both known ever so longsomething
that you have always consulted me about of your own accord and Abijah
too

Dont get excited replied Emma Jane I was only going to say you
were sure to be Mrs Somebody in course of time

Oh said Rebecca with a relieved sigh her color coming back if
thats all you meant just nonsense but I thought I thoughtI dont
really know just what I thought

I think you thought something you didnt want me to think you thought
said Emma Jane with unusual felicity

No its not that but somehow today I have been remembering things
Perhaps it was because at breakfast Aunt Jane and mother reminded me of
my coming birthday and said that Squire Bean would give me the deed of
the brick house That made me feel very old and responsible and when I
came out on the steps this afternoon it was just as if pictures of the
old years were moving up and down the road Everything is so beautiful
today Doesnt the sky look as if it had been dyed blue and the fields
painted pink and green and yellow this very minute

Its a perfectly elegant day responded Emma Jane with a sigh If
only my mind was at rest Thats the difference between being young and
grownup We never used to think and worry

Indeed we didnt Look Emmy theres the very spot where Uncle Jerry
Cobb stopped the stage and I stepped out with my pink parasol and my
bouquet of purple lilacs and you were watching me from your bedroom
window and wondering what I had in mothers little hair trunk strapped
on behind Poor Aunt Miranda didnt love me at first sight and oh how
cross she was the first two years But now every hard thought I ever had
comes back to me and cuts like a knife

She was dreadful hard to get along with and I used to hate her like
poison confessed Emma Jane but I am sorry now She was kinder toward
the last anyway and then you see children know so little We never
suspected she was sick or that she was worrying over that lost interest
money

Thats the trouble People seem hard and unreasonable and unjust
and we cant help being hurt at the time but if they die we forget
everything but our own angry speeches somehow we never remember theirs
And oh Emma Jane theres another such a sweet little picture out there
in the road The next day after I came to Riverboro do you remember I
stole out of the brick house crying and leaned against the front gate
You pushed your little fat pinkandwhite face through the pickets and
said Dont cry Ill kiss you if you will me

Lumps rose suddenly in Emma Janes throat and she put her arm around
Rebeccas waist as they sat together side by side

Oh I do remember she said in a choking voice And I can see the two
of us driving over to North Riverboro and selling soap to Mr Adam
Ladd and lighting up the premium banquet lamp at the Simpson party and
laying the daisies round Jacky Winslows mother when she was dead in
the cabin and trundling Jacky up and down the street in our old baby
carriage

And I remember you continued Rebecca being chased down the hill
by Jacob Moody when we were being Daughters of Zion and you had been
chosen to convert him

And I remember you getting the flag back from Mr Simpson and how you
looked when you spoke your verses at the flagraising

And have you forgotten the week I refused to speak to Abijah Flagg
because he fished my turban with the porcupine quills out of the river
when I hoped at last that I had lost it Oh Emma Jane we had dear good
times together in the little harbor

I always thought that was an elegant composition of yoursthat
farewell to the class said Emma Jane

The strong tide bears us on out of the little harbor of childhood into
the unknown seas recalled Rebecca It is bearing you almost out of
my sight Emmy these last days when you put on a new dress in the
afternoon and look out of the window instead of coming across the
street Abijah Flagg never used to be in the little harbor with the rest
of us when did he first sail in Emmy

Emma Jane grew a deeper pink and her buttonhole of a mouth quivered
with delicious excitement

It was last year at the seminary when he wrote me his first Latin
letter from Limerick Academy she said in a half whisper

I remember laughed Rebecca You suddenly began the study of the dead
languages and the Latin dictionary took the place of the crochet needle
in your affections It was cruel of you never to show me that letter
Emmy

I know every word of it by heart said the blushing Emma Jane and
I think I really ought to say it to you because its the only way you
will ever know how perfectly elegant Abijah is Look the other way
Rebecca Shall I have to translate it for you do you think because it
seems to me I could not bear to do that

It depends upon Abijahs Latin and your pronunciation teased Rebecca
Go on I will turn my eyes toward the orchard

The Fair Emmajane looking none too old still for the little harbor
but almost too young for the unknown seas gathered up her courage and
recited like a tremulous parrot the boyish love letter that had so fired
her youthful imagination

Vale carissima carissima puella repeated Rebecca in her musical
voice Oh how beautiful it sounds I dont wonder it altered your
feeling for Abijah Upon my word Emma Jane she cried with a sudden
change of tone if I had suspected for an instant that Abijah the Brave
had that Latin letter in him I should have tried to get him to write it
to me and then it would be I who would sit down at my mahogany desk and
ask Miss Perkins to come to tea with Mrs Flagg

Emma Jane paled and shuddered openly I speak as a church member
Rebecca she said when I tell you Ive always thanked the Lord that
you never looked at Abijah Flagg and he never looked at you If either
of you ever had there never would have been a chance for me and Ive
always known it

II

The romance alluded to in the foregoing chapter had been going on so
far as Abijah Flaggs part of it was concerned for many years his
affection dating back in his own mind to the first moment that he saw
Emma Jane Perkins at the age of nine

Emma Jane had shown no sign of reciprocating his attachment until the
last three years when the evolution of the choreboy into the
budding scholar and man of affairs had inflamed even her somewhat dull
imagination

Squire Beans wife had taken Abijah away from the poorhouse thinking
that she could make him of some little use in her home Abbie Flagg the
mother was neither wise nor beautiful it is to be feared that she
was not even good and her lack of all these desirable qualities
particularly the last one had been impressed upon the child ever since
he could remember People seemed to blame him for being in the world at
all this world that had not expected him nor desired him nor made any
provision for him The great battleaxe of poorhouse opinion was forever
leveled at the mere little atom of innocent transgression until he grew
sad and shy clumsy stiff and selfconscious He had an indomitable
craving for love in his heart and had never received a caress in his
life

He was more contented when he came to Squire Beans house The first
year he could only pick up chips carry pine wood into the kitchen go
to the postoffice run errands drive the cows and feed the hens but
every day he grew more and more useful

His only friend was little Jim Watson the storekeepers son and they
were inseparable companions whenever Abijah had time for play

One nevertobeforgotten July day a new family moved into the white
cottage between Squire Beans house and the Sawyers Mr Perkins had
sold his farm beyond North Riverboro and had established a blacksmiths
shop in the village at the Edgewood end of the bridge This fact was of
no special interest to the nineyearold Abijah but what really was of
importance was the appearance of a pretty little girl of seven in the
front yard a pretty little fat doll of a girl with bright fuzzy hair
pink cheeks blue eyes and a smile of almost bewildering continuity
Another might have criticised it as having the air of being glued on
but Abijah was already in the toils and never wished it to move

The next day being the glorious Fourth and a holiday Jimmy Watson came
over like David to visit his favorite Jonathan His Jonathan met him
at the top of the hill pleaded a pressing engagement curtly sent him
home and then went back to play with his new idol with whom he
had already scraped acquaintance her parents being exceedingly busy
settling the new house

After the noon dinner Jimmy again yearned to resume friendly relations
and forgetting his rebuff again toiled up the hill and appeared
unexpectedly at no great distance from the Perkins premises wearing the
broad and beaming smile of one who is confident of welcome

His morning call had been officious and unpleasant and unsolicited but
his afternoon visit could only be regarded as impudent audacious
and positively dangerous for Abijah and Emma Jane were cosily playing
house the game of all others in which it is particularly desirable to
have two and not three participants

At that moment the nature of Abijah changed at once and forever
Without a pang of conscience he flew over the intervening patch of
ground between himself and his dreaded rival and seizing small stones
and larger ones as haste and fury demanded flung them at Jimmy Watson
and flung and flung till the bewildered boy ran down the hill howling
Then he made a stickin door to the playhouse put the awed Emma Jane
inside and strode up and down in front of the edifice like an Indian
brave At such an early age does woman become a distracting and
disturbing influence in mans career

Time went on and so did the rivalry between the poorhouse boy and the
son of wealth but Abijahs chances of friendship with Emma Jane grew
fewer and fewer as they both grew older He did not go to school so
there was no meetingground there but sometimes when he saw the knot
of boys and girls returning in the afternoon he would invite Elijah and
Elisha the Simpson twins to visit him and take pains to be in Squire
Beans front yard doing something that might impress his inamorata as
she passed the premises

As Jimmy Watson was particularly small and fragile Abijah generally
chose feats of strength and skill for these prearranged performances

Sometimes he would throw his hat up into the elm trees as far as he
could and when it came down catch it on his head Sometimes he would
walk on his hands with his legs wriggling in the air or turn a double
somersault or jump incredible distances across the extended arms of
the Simpson twins and his bosom swelled with pride when the girls
exclaimed Isnt he splendid although he often heard his rival murmur
scornfully SMARTY ALECKa scathing allusion of unknown origin

Squire Bean although he did not send the boy to school thinking as
he was of no possible importance in the universe it was not worth
while bothering about his education finally became impressed with his
ability lent him books and gave him more time to study These were all
he needed books and time and when there was an especially hard knot to
untie Rebecca as the star scholar of the neighborhood helped him to
untie it

When he was sixteen he longed to go away from Riverboro and be something
better than a chore boy Squire Bean had been giving him small wages
for three or four years and when the time of parting came presented him
with a tendollar bill and a silver watch

Many a time had he discussed his future with Rebecca and asked her
opinion

This was not strange for there was nothing in human form that she could
not and did not converse with easily and delightedly She had ideas
on every conceivable subject and would have cheerfully advised the
minister if he had asked her The fishman consulted her when he couldnt
endure his motherinlaw another minute in the house Uncle Jerry
Cobb didnt part with his river field until he had talked it over with
Rebecca and as for Aunt Jane she couldnt decide whether to wear her
black merino or her gray thibet unless Rebecca cast the final vote

Abijah wanted to go far away from Riverboro as far as Limerick Academy
which was at least fifteen miles but although this seemed extreme
Rebecca agreed saying pensively There IS a kind of magicness about
going far away and then coming back all changed

This was precisely Abijahs unspoken thought Limerick knew nothing of
Abbie Flaggs worthlessness birth and training and the awful stigma
of his poorhouse birth so that he would start fair He could have gone
to Wareham and thus remained within daily sight of the beloved Emma
Jane but no he was not going to permit her to watch him in the process
of becoming but after he had become something He did not propose
to take any risks after all these years of silence and patience Not he
He proposed to disappear like the moon on a dark night and as he was
at present something that Mr Perkins would by no means have in the
family nor Mrs Perkins allow in the house he would neither return to
Riverboro nor ask any favors of them until he had something to offer
Yes sir He was going to be crammed to the eyebrows with learning for
one thinguseless kinds and allgoing to have good clothes and a
good income Everything that was in his power should be right because
there would always be lurking in the background the things he never
could helpthe mother and the poorhouse

So he went away and although at Squire Beans invitation he came back
the first year for two brief visits at Christmas and Easter he was
little seen in Riverboro for Mr Ladd finally found him a place where
he could make his vacations profitable and learn bookkeeping at the same
time

The visits in Riverboro were tantalizing rather than pleasant He
was invited to two parties but he was all the time conscious of his
shirtcollar and he was sure that his pants were not the proper
thing for by this time his ideals of dress had attained an almost
unrealizable height As for his shoes he felt that he walked on carpets
as if they were furrows and he were propelling a plow or a harrow before
him They played Drop the Handkerchief and Copenhagen at the parties
but he had not had the audacity to kiss Emma Jane which was bad enough
but Jimmy had and did which was infinitely worse The sight of James
Watsons unworthy and overambitious lips on Emma Janes pink cheek
almost destroyed his faith in an overruling Providence

After the parties were over he went back to his old room in Squire
Beans shed chamber As he lay in bed his thoughts fluttered about
Emma Jane as swallows circle around the eaves The terrible sickness of
hopeless handicapped love kept him awake Once he crawled out of bed in
the night lighted the lamp and looked for his mustache remembering
that he had seen a suspicion of down on his rivals upper lip He rose
again half an hour later again lighted the lamp put a few drops of oil
on his hair and brushed it violently for several minutes Then he went
back to bed and after making up his mind that he would buy a dulcimer
and learn to play on it so that he would be more attractive at parties
and outshine his rival in society as he had aforetime in athletics he
finally sank into a troubled slumber

Those days so full of hope and doubt and torture seemed mercifully
unreal now they lay so far back in the pastsix or eight years in
fact which is a lifetime to the lad of twentyand meantime he had
conquered many of the adverse circumstances that had threatened to cloud
his career

Abijah Flagg was a true child of his native State Something of the same
timber that Maine puts into her forests something of the same strength
and resisting power that she works into her rocks goes into her sons
and daughters and at twenty Abijah was going to take his fate in his
hand and ask Mr Perkins the rich blacksmith if after a suitable
period of probation during which he would further prepare himself for
his exalted destiny he might marry the fair Emma Jane sole heiress of
the Perkins house and fortunes

III

This was boy and girl love calf love perhaps though even that may
develop into something larger truer and finer but not so far away
were other and very different hearts growing and budding each in its
own way There was little Miss Dearborn the pretty school teacher
drifting into a foolish alliance because she did not agree with her
stepmother at home there was Herbert Dunn valedictorian of his class
dazzled by Huldah Meserve who like a glowworm shone afar off bright
but looked at near had neither heat nor light

There was sweet Emily Maxwell less than thirty still with most of her
heart bestowed in the wrong quarter She was toiling on at the Wareham
school living as unselfish a life as a nun in a convent lavishing the
mind and soul of her the heart and body of her on her chosen work
How many women give themselves thus consciously and unconsciously
and though they themselves miss the joys and compensations of mothering
their own little twos and threes God must be grateful to them for
their mothering of the hundreds which make them so precious in His
regenerating purposes

Then there was Adam Ladd waiting at thirtyfive for a girl to grow a
little older simply because he could not find one already grown who
suited his somewhat fastidious and exacting tastes

Ill not call Rebecca perfection he quoted once in a letter to Emily
MaxwellIll not call her perfection for thats a post afraid to
move But shes a dancing sprig of the tree next it

When first she appeared on his aunts piazza in North Riverboro and
insisted on selling him a large quantity of very inferior soap in order
that her friends the Simpsons might possess a premium in the shape of
a greatly needed banquet lamp she had riveted his attention He thought
all the time that he enjoyed talking with her more than with any woman
alive and he had never changed his opinion She always caught what
he said as if it were a ball tossed to her and sometimes her mind as
through it his thoughts came back to him seemed like a prism which had
dyed them with deeper colors

Adam Ladd always called Rebecca in his heart his little Spring His
boyhood had been lonely and unhappy That was the part of life he had
missed and although it was the full summer of success and prosperity
with him now he found his lost youth only in her

She was to himhow shall I describe it

Do you remember an early day in May with budding leaf warm earth
tremulous air and changing willful skyhow new it seemed How fresh
and joyous beyond all explaining

Have you lain with halfclosed eyes where the flickering of sunlight
through young leaves the song of birds and brook and the fragrance of
wild flowers combined to charm your senses and you felt the sweetness
and grace of nature as never before

Rebecca was springtide to Adams thirsty heart She was blithe youth
incarnate she was musican Aeolian harp that every passing breeze
woke to some whispering little tune she was a changing iridescent
joybubble she was the shadow of a leaf dancing across a dusty floor
No bough of his thought could be so bare but she somehow built a nest in
it and evoked life where none was before

And Rebecca herself

She had been quite unconscious of all this until very lately and even
now she was but half awakened searching among her childish instincts
and her girlish dreams for some Ariadne thread that should guide her
safely through the labyrinth of her new sensations

For the moment she was absorbed or thought she was in the little love
story of Abijah and Emma Jane but in reality had she realized it that
love story served chiefly as a basis of comparison for a possible one of
her own later on

She liked and respected Abijah Flagg and loving Emma Jane was a habit
contracted early in life but everything that they did or said or
thought or wrote or hoped or feared seemed so inadequate so painfully
short of what might be done or said or thought or written or hoped or
feared under easily conceivable circumstances that she almost felt a
disposition to smile gently at the fancy of the ignorant young couple
that they had caught a glimpse of the great vision

She was sitting under the sweet apple tree at twilight Supper was over
Marks restless feet were quiet Fanny and Jenny were tucked safely in
bed her aunt and her mother were stemming currants on the side porch

A blue spot at one of the Perkins windows showed that in one vestal
bosom hope was not dead yet although it was seven oclock

Suddenly there was the sound of a horses feet coming up the quiet road
plainly a steed hired from some metropolis like Milltown or Wareham
as Riverboro horses when through with their days work never disported
themselves so gayly

A little open vehicle came in sight and in it sat Abijah Flagg The
wagon was so freshly painted and so shiny that Rebecca thought that he
must have alighted at the bridge and given it a last polish The creases
in his trousers too had an air of having been pressed in only a few
minutes before The whip was new and had a yellow ribbon on it the
gray suit of clothes was new and the coat flourished a flower in its
buttonhole The hat was the latest thing in hats and the intrepid
swain wore a sealring on the little finger of his right hand As
Rebecca remembered that she had guided it in making capital Gs in his
copybook she felt positively maternal although she was two years
younger than Abijah the Brave

He drove up to the Perkins gate and was so long about hitching the horse
that Rebeccas heart beat tumultuously at the thought of Emma Janes
heart waiting under the blue barege Then he brushed an imaginary speck
off his sleeve then he drew on a pair of buff kid gloves then he went
up the path rapped at the knocker and went in

Not all the heroes go to the wars thought Rebecca Abijah has laid
the ghost of his father and redeemed the memory of his mother for no
one will dare say again that Abbie Flaggs son could never amount to
anything

The minutes went by and more minutes and more The tranquil dusk
settled down over the little village street and the young moon came out
just behind the top of the Perkins pine tree

The Perkins front door opened and Abijah the Brave came out hand in hand
with his Fair Emma Jane

They walked through the orchard the eyes of the old couple following
them from the window and just as they disappeared down the green slope
that led to the riverside the gray coat sleeve encircled the blue barege
waist

Rebecca quivering with instant sympathy and comprehension hid her face
in her hands

Emmy has sailed away and I am all alone in the little harbor she
thought

It was as if childhood like a thing real and visible were slipping
down the grassy river banks after Abijah and Emma Jane and
disappearing like them into the moonlit shadows of the summer night

I am all alone in the little harbor she repeated and oh I wonder
I wonder shall I be afraid to leave it if anybody ever comes to carry
me out to sea
