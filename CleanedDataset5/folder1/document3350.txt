THE WANDERING JEW

By Eugene Sue



A NOTE ON THE AUTHOR OF THE WANDERING JEW EUGENE SUE

18041857

Time and again physicians and seamen have made noteworthy reputations as
novelists But it is rare in the annals of literature that a man trained
in both professions should have gained his greatest fame as a writer of
novels Eugene Sue began his career as a physician and surgeon and then
spent six years in the French Navy In 1830 when he returned to
France he inherited his fathers rich estate and was free to follow
his inclination to write His first novel Plick et Plock met with
an unexpected success and he at once foreswore the arts of healing and
navigation for the precarious life of a man of letters With varying
success he produced books from his inexhaustible store of personal
experiences as a doctor and sailor In 1837 he wrote an authoritative
work on the French Navy Histoire de la marine Francaise

More and more the novel appealed to his imagination and suited his
gifts His themes ranged from the fabulous to the strictly historical
and he became popular as a writer of romance and fictionized fact
His plays however were persistent failures When he published The
Mysteries of Paris his national fame was assured and with the writing
of The Wandering Jew he achieved worldwide renown Then at the
height of his literary career Eugene Sue was driven into exile after
Louis Napoleon overthrew the Constitutional Government in a coup detat
and had himself officially proclaimed Emperor Napoleon III The author
of The Wandering Jew died in banishment five years later

Prologue




The Lands End of Two Worlds

The Arctic Ocean encircles with a belt of eternal ice the desert
confines of Siberia and North Americathe uttermost limits of the Old
and New worlds separated by the narrow channel known as Behrings
Straits

The last days of September have arrived

The equinox has brought with it darkness and Northern storms and night
will quickly close the short and dismal polar day The sky of a dull
and leaden blue is faintly lighted by a sun without warmth whose
white disk scarcely seen above the horizon pales before the dazzling
brilliancy of the snow that covers as far as the eyes can reach the
boundless steppes

To the North this desert is bounded by a ragged coast bristling with
huge black rocks

At the base of this Titanic mass lied enchained the petrified ocean
whose spellbound waves appear fired as vast ranges of ice mountains
their blue peaks fading away in the faroff frost smoke or snow vapor

Between the twinpeaks of Cape East the termination of Siberia the
sullen sea is seen to drive tall icebergs across a streak of dead green
There lies Behrings Straits

Opposite and towering over the channel rise the granite masses of Cape
Prince of Wales the headland of North America

These lonely latitudes do not belong to the habitable world for the
piercing cold shivers the stones splits the trees and causes the earth
to burst asunder which throwing forth showers of icy spangles seems
capable of enduring this solitude of frost and tempest of famine and
death

And yet strange to say footprints may be traced on the snow covering
these headlands on either side of Behrings Straits

On the American shore the footprints are small and light thus
betraying the passage of a woman

She has been hastening up the rocky peak whence the drifts of Siberia
are visible

On the latter ground footprints larger and deeper betoken the passing
of a man He also was on his way to the Straits

It would seem that this man and woman had arrived here from opposite
directions in hope of catching a glimpse of one another across the arm
of the sea dividing the two worldsthe Old and the New

More strange still the man and the woman have crossed the solitudes
during a terrific storm Black pines the growth of centuries pointing
their bent heads in different parts of the solitude like crosses in a
churchyard have been uprooted rent and hurled aside by the blasts

Yet the two travellers face this furious tempest which has plucked up
trees and pounded the frozen masses into splinters with the roar of
thunder

They face it without for one single instant deviating from the straight
line hitherto followed by them

Who then are these two beings who advance thus calmly amidst the storms
and convulsions of nature

Is it by chance or design or destiny that the seven nails in the sole
of the mans shoe form a crossthus

 
   
 
 
 

Everywhere he leaves this impress behind him

On the smooth and polished snow these footmarks seem imprinted by a
foot of brass on a marble floor

Night without twilight has soon succeeded daya night of foreboding
gloom

The brilliant reflection of the snow renders the white steppes still
visible beneath the azure darkness of the sky and the pale stars
glimmer on the obscure and frozen dome

Solemn silence reigns

But towards the Straits a faint light appears

At first a gentle bluish light such as precedes moonrise it
increases in brightness and assumes a ruddy hue

Darkness thickens in every other direction the white wilds of the
desert are now scarcely visible under the black vault of the firmament

Strange and confused noises are heard amidst this obscurity

They sound like the flight of large nightbirdsnow flapping
nowheavily skimming over the steppesnow descending

But no cry is heard

This silent terror heralds the approach of one of those imposing
phenomena that awe alike the most ferocious and the most harmless of
animated beings An Aurora Borealis magnificent sight common in the
polar regions suddenly beams forth

A half circle of dazzling whiteness becomes visible in the horizon
Immense columns of light stream forth from this dazzling centre rising
to a great height illuminating earth sea and sky Then a brilliant
reflection like the blaze of a conflagration steals over the snow of
the desert purples the summits of the mountains of ice and imparts a
dark red hue to the black rocks of both continents

After attaining this magnificent brilliancy the Northern Lights fade
away gradually and their vivid glow is lost in a luminous fog

Just then by a wondrous mirage an effect very common in high latitudes
the American Coast though separated from Siberia by a broad arm of the
sea loomed so close that a bridge might seemingly be thrown from one
world to other

Then human forms appeared in the transparent azure haze overspreading
both forelands

On the Siberian Cape a man on his knees stretched his arms towards
America with an expression of inconceivable despair

On the American promontory a young and handsome woman replied to the
mans despairing gesture by pointing to heaven

For some seconds these two tall figures stood out pale and shadowy in
the farewell gleams of the Aurora

But the fog thickens and all is lost in the darkness

Whence came the two beings who met thus amidst polar glaciers at the
extremities of the Old and New worlds

Who were the two creatures brought near for a moment by a deceitful
mirage but who seemed eternally separated




CHAPTER I MOROK

The month of October 1831 draws to its close

Though it is still day a brass lamp with four burners illumines the
cracked walls of a large loft whose solitary window is closed against
outer light A ladder with its top rungs coming up through an open trap
leads to it

Here and there at random on the floor lie iron chains spiked collars
sawtoothed snaffles muzzles bristling with nails and long iron rods
set in wooden handles In one corner stands a portable furnace such as
tinkers use to melt their spelter charcoal and dry chips fill it so
that a spark would suffice to kindle this furnace in a minute

Not far from this collection of ugly instruments putting one in mind
of a torturers kit of tools there are some articles of defence and
offence of a bygone age A coat of mail with links so flexible close
and light that it resembles steel tissue hangs from a box beside iron
cuishes and armpieces in good condition even to being properly fitted
with straps A mace and two long threecorneredheaded pikes with ash
handles strong and light at the same time spotted with latelyshed
blood complete the armory modernized somewhat by the presence of two
Tyrolese rifles loaded and primed

Along with this arsenal of murderous weapons and outofdate
instruments is strangely mingled a collection of very different
objects being small glasslidded boxes full of rosaries chaplets
medals AGNUS DEI holy water bottles framed pictures of saints etc
not to forget a goodly number of those chapbooks struck off in Friburg
on coarse bluish paper in which you can hear about miracles of our own
time or Jesus Christs Letter to a true believer containing awful
predictions as for the years 1831 and 32 about impious revolutionary
France

One of those canvas daubs with which strolling showmen adorn their
booths hangs from a rafter no doubt to prevent its being spoilt by too
long rolling up It bore the following legend

 THE DOWNRIGHT TRUE AND MOST MEMORABLE CONVERSION OF IGNATIUS MOROK
 KNOWN AS THE PROPHET HAPPENING IN FRIBURG 1828TH YEAR OF GRACE

This picture of a size larger than natural of gaudy color and in bad
taste is divided into three parts each presenting an important phase
in the life of the convert surnamed The Prophet In the first behold
a longbearded man the hair almost white with uncouth face and clad
in reindeer skin like the Siberian savage His black foreskin cap is
topped with a ravens head his features express terror Bent forward in
his sledge which halfadozen huge tawny dogs draw over the snow he
is fleeing from the pursuit of a pack of foxes wolves and big bears
whose gaping jaws and formidable teeth seem quite capable of devouring
man sledge and dogs a hundred times over Beneath this section
reads

 IN 1810 MOROK THE IDOLATER FLED FROM WILD BEASTS

In the second picture Morok decently clad in a catechumens white gown
kneels with clasped hands to a man who wears a white neckcloth and
flowing black robe In a corner a tall angel of repulsive aspect
holds a trumpet in one hand and flourishes a flaming sword with the
other while the words which follow flow out of his mouth in red
letters on a black ground

 MOROK THE IDOLATER FLED FROM WILD BEASTS BUT WILD BEASTS WILL FLEE
 FROM IGNATIUS MOROK CONVERTED AND BAPTIZED IN FRIBURG

Thus in the last compartment the new convert proudly boastfully and
triumphantly parades himself in a flowing robe of blue head up left
arm akimbo right hand outstretched he seems to scare the wits out of a
multitude of lions tigers hyenas and bears who with sheathed claws
and masked teeth crouch at his feet awestricken and submissive

Under this is the concluding moral

 IGNATIUS MOROK BEING CONVERTED WILD BEASTS CROUCH BEFORE HIM

Not far from this canvas are several parcels of halfpenny books
likewise from the Friburg press which relate by what an astounding
miracle Morok the Idolater acquired a supernatural power almost
divine the moment he was converteda power which the wildest animal
could not resist and which was testified to every day by the lion
tamers performances given less to display his courage than to show
his praise unto the Lord

Through the trapdoor which opens into the loft reek up puffs of a
rank sour penetrating odor From time to time are heard sonorous
growls and deep breathings followed by a dull sound as of great bodies
stretching themselves heavily along the floor

A man is alone in this loft It is Morok the tamer of wild beasts
surnamed the Prophet

He is forty years old of middle height with lank limbs and an
exceedingly spare frame he is wrapped in a long bloodred pelisse
lined with black fur his complexion fair by nature is bronzed by the
wandering life he has led from childhood his hair of that dead yellow
peculiar to certain races of the Polar countries falls straight
and stiff down his shoulders and his thin sharp hooked nose and
prominent cheekbones surmount a long beard bleached almost to
whiteness Peculiarly marking the physiognomy of this man is the wide
open eye with its tawny pupil ever encircled by a rim of white
This fixed extraordinary look exercises a real fascination over
animalswhich however does not prevent the Prophet from also
employing to tame them the terrible arsenal around him

Seated at a table he has just opened the false bottom of a box filled
with chaplets and other toys for the use of the devout Beneath this
false bottom secured by a secret lock are several sealed envelopes
with no other address than a number combined with a letter of the
alphabet The Prophet takes one of these packets conceals it in the
pocket of his pelisse and closing the secret fastening of the false
bottom replaces the box upon a shelf

This scene occurs about four oclock in the afternoon in the White
Falcon the only hostelry in the little village of Mockern situated
near Leipsic as you come from the north towards France

After a few moments the loft is shaken by a hoarse roaring from below

Judas be quiet exclaims the Prophet in a menacing tone as he turns
his head towards the trap door

Another deep growl is heard formidable as distant thunder

Lie down Cain cries Morok starting from his seat

A third roar of inexpressible ferocity bursts suddenly on the ear

Death Will you have done cries the Prophet rushing towards the trap
door and addressing a third invisible animal which bears this ghastly
name

Notwithstanding the habitual authority of his voicenotwithstanding
his reiterated threatsthe brutetamer cannot obtain silence on the
contrary the barking of several dogs is soon added to the roaring of
the wild beasts Morok seizes a pike and approaches the ladder he is
about to descend when he sees some one issuing from the aperture

The newcomer has a brown sunburnt face he wears a gray hat bell
crowned and broadbrimmed with a short jacket and wide trousers of
green cloth his dusty leathern gaiters show that he has walked some
distance a gamebag is fastened by straps to his back

The devil take the brutes cried he as he set foot on the floor
one would think theyd forgotten me in three days Judas thrust his paw
through the bars of his cage and Death danced like a fury They dont
know me any more it seems

This was said in German Morok answered in the same language but with a
slightly foreign accent

Good or bad news Karl he inquired with some uneasiness

Good news

Youve met them

Yesterday two leagues from Wittenberg

Heaven be praised cried Morok clasping his hands with intense
satisfaction

Oh of course tis the direct road from Russia to France twas a
thousand to one that we should find them somewhere between Wittenberg
and Leipsic

And the description

Very close two young girls in mourning horse white the old man has
long moustache blue foragecap gray topcoat and a Siberian dog at his
heels

And where did you leave them

A league hence They will be here within the hour

And in this innsince it is the only one in the village said Morok
with a pensive air

And night drawing on added Karl

Did you get the old man to talk

Himyou dont suppose it

Why not

Go and try yourself

And for what reason

Impossible

Impossiblewhy

You shall know all about it Yesterday as if I had fallen in with
them by chance I followed them to the place where they stopped for the
night I spoke in German to the tall old man accosting him as is usual
with wayfarers Goodday and a pleasant journey comrade But for an
answer he looked askant at me and pointed with the end of his stick
to the other side of the road

He is a Frenchman and perhaps does not understand German

He speaks it at least as well as you for at the inn I heard him ask
the host for whatever he and the young girls wanted

And did you not again attempt to engage him in conversation

Once only but I met with such a rough reception that for fear of
making mischief I did not try again Besides between ourselves I can
tell you this man has a devilish ugly look believe me in spite of his
gray moustache he looks so vigorous and resolute though with no more
flesh on him than a carcass that I dont know whether he or my mate
Giant Goliath would have the best of it in a struggle I know not your
plans only take care mastertake care

My black panther of Java was also very vigorous and very vicious said
Morok with a grim disdainful smile

What Death Yes in truth and she is vigorous and vicious as ever
Only to you she is almost mild

And thus I will break this tall old man notwithstanding his strength
and surliness

Humph humph be on your guard master You are clever you are as
brave as any one but believe me you will never make a lamb out of the
old wolf that will be here presently

Does not my lion Caindoes not my tiger Judas crouch in terror
before me

Yes I believe you therebecause you have means

Because I have faith that is alland it is all said Morok
imperiously interrupting Karl and accompanying these words with such a
look that the other hung his head and was silent

Why should not he whom the Lord upholds in his struggle with wild
beasts be also upheld in his struggle with men when those men are
perverse and impious added the Prophet with a triumphant inspired
air

Whether from belief in his masters conviction or from inability to
engage in a controversy with him on so delicate a subject Karl answered
the Prophet humbly you are wiser than I am master what you do must
be well done

Did you follow this old man and these two young girls all day long
resumed the Prophet after a moments silence

Yes but at a distance As I know the country well I sometimes cut
across a valley sometimes over a hill keeping my eye upon the road
where they were always to be seen The last time I saw them I was hid
behind the watermill by the potteries As they were on the highway for
this place and night was drawing on I quickened my pace to get here
before them and be the bearer of what you call good news

Very goodyesvery good and you shall be rewarded for if these
people had escaped me

The Prophet started and did not conclude the sentence The expression
of his face and the tones of his voice indicated the importance of the
intelligence which had just been brought him

In truth rejoined Karl it may be worth attending to for that
Russian courier all plastered with lace who came without slacking
bridle from St Petersburg to Leipsic only to see you rode so fast
perhaps for the purpose

Morok abruptly interrupted Karl and said

Who told you that the arrival of the courier had anything to do with
these travellers You are mistaken you should only know what I choose
to tell you

Well master forgive me and lets say no more about it So I will
get rid of my gamebag and go help Goliath to feed the brutes for
their supper time draws near if it is not already past Does our big
giant grow lazy master

Goliath is gone out he must not know that you are returned above all
the tall old man and the maidens must not see you hereit would make
them suspect something

Where do you wish me to go then

Into the loft at the end of the stable and wait my orders you may
this night have to set out for Leipsic

As you please I have some provisions left in my pouch and can sup in
the loft whilst I rest myself

Go

Master remember what I told you Beware of that old fellow with
the gray moustache I think hes devilish tough Im up to these
thingshes an ugly customerbe on your guard

Be quite easy I am always on my guard said Morok

Then good luck to you masterand Karl having reached the ladder
suddenly disappeared

After making a friendly farewell gesture to his servant the Prophet
walked up and down for some time with an air of deep meditation then
approaching the box which contained the papers he took out a pretty
long letter and read it over and over with profound attention From
time to time he rose and went to the closed window which looked upon
the inner court of the inn and appealed to listen anxiously for he
waited with impatience the arrival of the three persons whose approach
had just been announced to him




CHAPTER II THE TRAVELLERS

While the above scene was passing in the White Falcon at Mockern the
three persons whose arrival Morok was so anxiously expecting travelled
on leisurely in the midst of smiling meadows bounded on one side by
a river the current of which turned a mill and on the other by the
highway leading to the village which was situated on an eminence at
about a leagues distance

The sky was beautifully serene the bubbling of the river beaten by the
millwheel and sparkling with foam alone broke upon the silence of an
evening profoundly calm Thick willows bending over the river covered
it with their green transparent shadow whilst further on the stream
reflected so splendidly the blue heavens and the glowing tints of the
west that but for the hills which rose between it and the sky the
gold and azure of the water would have mingled in one dazzling sheet
with the gold and azure of the firmament The tall reeds on the bank
bent their black velvet heads beneath the light breath of the breeze
that rises at the close of dayfor the sun was gradually sinking behind
a broad streak of purple clouds fringed with fire The tinkling bells
of a flock of sheep sounded from afar in the clear and sonorous air

Along a path trodden in the grass of the meadow two girls almost
childrenfor they had but just completed their fifteenth yearwere
riding on a white horse of medium size seated upon a large saddle with
a back to it which easily took them both in for their figures were
slight and delicate

A man of tall stature with a sunburnt face and long gray moustache
was leading the horse by the bridle and ever and anon turned towards
the girls with an air of solicitude at once respectful and paternal He
leaned upon a long staff his still robust shoulders carried a soldiers
knapsack his dusty shoes and step that began to drag a little showed
that he had walked a long way

One of those dogs which the tribes of Northern Siberia harness to their
sledgesa sturdy animal nearly of the size form and hairy coat of
the wolffollowed closely in the steps of the leader of this little
caravan never quitting as it is commonly said the heels of his
master

Nothing could be more charming than the group formed by the girls One
held with her left hand the flowing reins and with her right encircled
the waist of her sleeping sister whose head reposed on her shoulder
Each step of the horse gave a graceful swaying to these pliant forms
and swung their little feet which rested on a wooden ledge in lieu of a
stirrup

These twin sisters by a sweet maternal caprice had been called Rose
and Blanche they were now orphans as might be seen by their sad
mourning vestments already much worn Extremely like in feature and
of the same size it was necessary to be in the constant habit of seeing
them to distinguish one from the other The portrait of her who slept
not might serve them for both of them the only difference at the
moment being that Rose was awake and discharging for that day the
duties of elder sisterduties thus divided between then according to
the fancy of their guide who being an old soldier of the empire and a
martinet had judged fit thus to alternate obedience and command between
the orphans

Greuze would have been inspired by the sight of those sweet faces
coifed in close caps of black velvet from beneath which strayed a
profusion of thick ringlets of a light chestnut color floating down
their necks and shoulders and setting as in a frame their round
firm rosy satin like cheeks A carnation bathed in dew is of no
richer softness than their blooming lips the wood violets tender blue
would appear dark beside the limpid azure of their large eyes in which
are depicted the sweetness of their characters and the innocence of
their age a pure and white forehead small nose dimpled chin complete
these graceful countenances which present a delightful blending of
candor and gentleness

You should have seen them too when on the threatening of rain or
storm the old soldier carefully wrapped them both in a large pelisse
of reindeer fur and pulled over their heads the ample hood of this
impervious garment then nothing could be more lovely than those fresh
and smiling little faces sheltered beneath the darkcolored cowl

But now the evening was fine and calm the heavy cloak hung in folds
about the knees of the sisters and the hood rested on the back of their
saddle

Rose still encircling with her right arm the waist of her sleeping
sister contemplated her with an expression of ineffable tenderness
akin to maternal for Rose was the eldest for the day and an elder
sister is almost a mother

Not only did the orphans idolize each other but by a psychological
phenomenon frequent with twins they were almost always simultaneously
affected the emotion of one was reflected instantly in the countenance
of the other the same cause would make both of them start or blush so
closely did their young hearts beat in unison all ingenuous joys all
bitter griefs were mutually felt and shared in a moment between them

In their infancy simultaneously attacked by a severe illness like two
flowers on the same steam they had drooped grown pale and languished
together but together also had they again found the pure fresh hues of
health

Need it be said that those mysterious indissoluble links which united
the twins could not have been broken without striking a mortal blow at
the existence of the poor children

Thus the sweet birds called lovebirds only living in pairs as if
endowed with a common life pine despond and die when parted by a
barbarous hand

The guide of the orphans a man of about fiftyfive distinguished by
his military air and gait preserved the immortal type of the warriors
of the republic and the empiresome heroic of the people who became
in one campaign the first soldiers in the worldto prove what the
people can do have done and will renew when the rulers of their
choice place in them confidence strength and their hope

This soldier guide of the sisters and formerly a horsegrenadier
of the Imperial Guard had been nicknamed Dagobert His grave stern
countenance was strongly marked his long gray and thick moustache
completely concealed his upper lip and united with a large imperial
which almost covered his chin his meagre cheeks brickcolored and
tanned as parchment were carefully shaven thick eyebrows still black
overhung and shaded his light blue eyes gold earrings reached down to
his whiteedged military stock his topcoat of coarse gray cloth was
confined at the waist by a leathern belt and a blue foraging cap with
a red tuft falling on his left shoulder covered his bald head

Once endowed with the strength of Hercules and having still the
heart of a lionkind and patient because he was courageous and
strongDagobert notwithstanding his rough exterior evinced for his
orphan charges an exquisite solicitude a watchful kindness and a
tenderness almost maternal Yes motherly for the heroism of affection
dwells alike in the mothers heart and the soldiers

Stoically calm and repressing all emotion the unchangeable coolness of
Dagobert never failed him and though few were less given to drollery
he was now and then highly comic by reason of the imperturbable gravity
with which he did everything

From time to time as they journeyed on Dagobert would turn to bestow
a caress or friendly word on the good white home upon which the orphans
were mounted Its furrowed sides and long teeth betrayed a venerable
age Two deep scars one on the flank and the other on the chest proved
that his horse had been present in hot battles nor was it without an
act of pride that he sometimes shook his old military bridle the brass
stud of which was still adorned with an embossed eagle His pace was
regular careful and steady his coat sleek and his bulk moderate the
abundant foam which covered his bit bore witness to that health which
horses acquire by the constant but not excessive labor of a long
journey performed by short stages Although he had been more than six
months on the road this excellent animal carried the orphans with a
tolerably heavy portmanteau fastened to the saddle as freely as on the
day they started

If we have spoken of the excessive length of the horses teeththe
unquestionable evidence of great ageit is chiefly because he often
displayed them for the sole purpose of acting up to his name he was
called Jovial by playing a mischievous trick of which the dog was the
victim

This latter who doubtless for the sake of contrast was called
Spoilsport Rabatjoie being always at his masters heels found
himself within the reach of Jovial who from time to time nipped him
delicately by the nape of the neck lifted him from the ground and
carried him thus for a moment The dog protected by his thick coat
and no doubt long accustomed to the practical jokes of his companion
submitted to all this with stoical complacency save that when he
thought the jest had lasted long enough he would turn his head and
growl Jovial understood him at the first hint and hastened to set him
down again At other times just to avoid monotony Jovial would gently
bite the knapsack of the soldier who seemed as well as the dog to be
perfectly accustomed to his pleasantries

These details will give a notion of the excellent understanding that
existed between the twin sisters the old soldier the horse and the
dog

The little caravan proceeded on its ways anxious to reach before night
the village of Mockern which was now visible on the summit of a hill
Ever and anon Dagobert looked around him and seemed to be gathering up
old recollections by degrees his countenance became clouded and
when he was at a little distance from the mill the noise of which had
arrested his attention he stopped and drew his long moustache several
times between his finger and thumb the only sign which revealed in him
any strong and concentrated feeling

Jovial having stopped short behind his master Blanche awakened
suddenly by the shock raised her head her first look sought her
sister on whom she smiled sweetly then both exchanged glances of
surprise on seeing Dagobert motionless with his hands clasped and
resting on his long staff apparently affected by some painful and deep
emotion

The orphans just chanced to be at the foot of a little mound the summit
of which was buried in the thick foliage of a huge oak planted half
way down the slope Perceiving that Dagobert continued motionless and
absorbed in thought Rose leaned over her saddle and placing her
little white hand on the shoulder of their guide whose back was turned
towards her said to him in a soft voice Whatever is the matter with
you Dagobert

The veteran turned to the great astonishment of the sisters they
perceived a large tear which traced its humid furrow down his tanned
cheek and lost itself in his thick moustache

You weepingyou cried Rose and Blanche together deeply moved Tell
us we beseech what is the matter

After a moments hesitation the soldier brushed his horny hand across
his eyes and said to the orphans in a faltering voice whilst he
pointed to the old oak beside them I shall make you sad my poor
children and yet what Im going to tell you has something sacred in it
Well eighteen years ago on the eve of the great battle of Leipsic
I carried your father to this very tree He had two sabrecuts on the
head a musket ball in his shoulder and it was here that he and Iwho
had got two thrust of a lance for my sharewere taken prisoners and by
whom worse luckwhy a renegado By a Frenchmanan emigrant marquis
then colonel in the service of Russiaand who afterwardsbut one day
you shall know all

The veteran paused then pointing with his staff to the village of
Mockern he added Yes yes I can recognize the spot Yonder are the
heights where your brave fatherwho commanded us and the Poles of
the Guardoverthrew the Russian Cuirassiers after having carried
the battery Ah my children continued the soldier with the utmost
simplicity I wish you had seen your brave father at the head of our
brigade of horse rushing on in a desperate charge in the thick of a
shower of shellsThere was nothing like itnot a soul so grand as
he

Whilst Dagobert thus expressed in his own way his regrets and
recollections the two orphansby a spontaneous movement glided gently
from the horse and holding each other by the hand went together to
kneel at the foot of the old oak And there closely pressed in each
others arms they began to weep whilst the soldier standing behind
them with his hands crossed on his long staff rested his bald front
upon it

Come come you must not fret said he softly when after a pause of
a few minutes he saw tears run down the blooming cheeks of Rose and
Blanche still on their knees Perhaps we may find General Simon in
Paris added he I will explain all that to you this evening at the
inn I purposely waited for this day to tell you many things about
your father it was an idea of mine because this day is a sort of
anniversary

We weep because we think also of our mother said Rose

Of our mother whom we shall only see again in heaven added Blanche

The soldier raised the orphans took each by the hand and gazing from
one to the other with ineffable affection rendered still the more
touching by the contrast of his rude features You must not give way
thus my children said he it is true your mother was the best of
women When she lived in Poland they called her the Pearl of Warsawit
ought to have been the Pearl of the Whole Worldfor in the whole world
you could not have found her match Nono

The voice of Dagobert faltered he paused and drew his long gray
moustache between finger and thumb as was his habit Listen my
girls he resumed when he had mastered his emotion your mother could
give you none but the best advice eh

Yes Dagobert

Well what instructions did she give you before she died To think
often of her but without grieving

It is true she told us than our Father in heaven always good to poor
mothers whose children are left on earth would permit her to hear us
from above said Blanche

And that her eyes would be ever fixed upon us added Rose

And the two by a spontaneous impulse replete with the most touching
grace joined hands raised their innocent looks to heaven and
exclaimed with that beautiful faith natural to their age Is it not
so motherthou seest usthou hearest us

Since your mother sees and hears you said Dagobert much moved do
not grieve her by fretting She forbade you to do so

You are right Dagobert We will not cry any moreAnd the orphans
dried their eyes

Dagobert in the opinion of the devout would have passed for a very
heathen In Spain he had found pleasure in cutting down those monks of
all orders and colors who bearing crucifix in one hand and poniard
in the other fought not for libertythe Inquisition had strangled her
centuries agobut for their monstrous privileges Yet in forty years
Dagobert had witnessed so many sublime and awful sceneshe had been
so many times face to face with deaththat the instinct of natural
religion common to every simple honest heart had always remained
uppermost in his soul Therefore though he did not share in the
consoling faith of the two sisters he would have held as criminal any
attempt to weaken its influence

Seeing them this downcast he thus resumed Thats right my
pretty ones I prefer to hear you chat as you did this morning and
yesterdaylaughing at times and answering me when I speak instead of
being so much engrossed with your own talk Yes yes my little ladies
you seem to have had famous secrets together these last two daysso
much the better if it amuses you

The sisters colored and exchanged a subdued smile which contrasted
with the tears that yet filled their eyes and Rose said to the soldier
with a little embarrassment No I assure you Dagobert we talk of
nothing in particular

Well well I dont wish to know it Come rest yourselves a few
moments more and then we must start again for it grows late and we
have to reach Mockern before night so that we may be early on the road
tomorrow

Have we still a long long way to go asked Rose

What to reach Paris Yes my children some hundred days march We
dont travel quick but we get on and we travel cheap because we have
a light purse A closet for you a straw mattress and a blanket at your
door for me with Spoilsport on my feet and a clean litter for old
Jovial these are our whole traveling expenses I say nothing about
food because you two together dont eat more than a mouse and I have
learnt in Egypt and Spain to be hungry only when it suits

Not forgetting that to save still more you do all the cooking for us
and will not even let us assist

And to think good Dagobert that you wash almost every evening at our
restingplace As if it were not for us to

You said the soldier interrupting Blanche I allow you to chap
your pretty little hands in soapsuds Pooh dont a soldier on a
campaign always wash his own linen Clumsy as you see me I was the best
washerwoman in my squadronand what a hand at ironing Not to make a
brag of it

Yes yesyou can iron wellvery well

Only sometimes there will be a little singe said Rose smiling

Hah when the iron is too hot Zounds I may bring it as near my cheek
as I please my skin is so tough that I dont feel the heat said
Dagobert with imperturbable gravity

We are only jesting good Dagobert

Then children if you think that I know my trade as a washerwoman let
me continue to have your custom it is cheaper and on a journey poor
people like us should save where we can for we must at all events
keep enough to reach Paris Once there our papers and the medal you
wear will do the restI hope so at least

This medal is sacred to us mother gave it to us on her deathbed

Therefore take great care that you do not lose it see from time to
time that you have it safe

Here it is said Blanche as she drew from her bosom a small bronze
medal which she wore suspended from her neck by a chain of the same
material The medal bore on its faces the following inscriptions

 Victim
 of
 L C D J
 Pray for me
 
 Paris
 February the 13th 1682

 At Paris
 Rue Saint Francois No 3
 In a century and a half
 you will be
 February the 13th 1832
 
 PRAY FOR ME

What does it mean Dagobert resumed Blanche as she examined the
mournful inscriptions Mother was not able to tell us

We will discuss all that this evening at the place where we sleep
answered Dagobert It grows late let us be moving Put up the medal
carefully and awayWe have yet nearly an hours march to arrive at
quarters Come my poor pets once more look at the mound where your
brave father felland thento horse to horse

The orphans gave a last pious glance at the spot which had recalled to
their guide such painful recollections and with his aid remounted
Jovial

This venerable animal had not for one moment dreamed of moving but
with the consummate forethought of a veteran he had made the best use
of his time by taking from that foreign soil a large contribution of
green and tender grass before the somewhat envious eyes of Spoilsport
who had comfortably established himself in the meadow with his snout
protruding between his forepaws On the signal of departure the dog
resumed his post behind his master and Dagobert trying the ground with
the end of his long staff led the horse carefully along by the bridle
for the meadow was growing more and more marshy indeed after advancing
a few steps he was obliged to turn off to the left in order to regain
the highroad

On reaching Mockern Dagobert asked for the least expensive inn and was
told there was only one in the villagethe White Falcon

Let us go then to the White Falcon observed the soldier




CHAPTER III THE ARRIVAL

Already had Morok several times opened with impatience the window
shutters of the loft to look out upon the innyard watching for the
arrival of the orphans and the soldier Not seeing them he began once
more to walk slowly up and down with his head bent forward and his
arms folded on his bosom meditating on the best means to carry out
the plan he had conceived The ideas which possessed his mind were
doubtless of a painful character for his countenance grew even more
gloomy than usual

Notwithstanding his ferocious appearance he was by no means deficient
in intelligence The courage displayed in his taming exercises which
he gravely attributed to his recent conversion a solemn and mystical
style of speech and a hypocritical affectation of austerity had given
him a species of influence over the people he visited in his travels
Long before his conversion as may well be supposed Morok had been
familiar with the habits of wild beasts In fact born in the north of
Siberia he had been from his boyhood one of the boldest hunters of
bears and reindeer later in 1810 he had abandoned this profession to
serve as guide to a Russian engineer who was charged with an exploring
expedition to the Polar regions He afterwards followed him to St
Petersburg and there after some vicissitudes of fortune Morok became
one of the imperial couriersthese iron automata that the least
caprice of the despot hurls in a frail sledge through the immensity of
the empire from Persia to the Frozen Sea For these men who travel
night and day with the rapidity of lightning there are neither seasons
nor obstacles fatigues nor danger living projectiles they must either
be broken to pieces or reach the intended mark One may conceive the
boldness the vigor and the resignation of men accustomed to such a
life

It is useless to relate here by what series of singular circumstances
Morok was induced to exchange his rough pursuit for another profession
and at last to enter as catechumen a religious house at Friburg
after which being duly and properly converted he began his nomadic
excursions with his menagerie of unknown origin

Morok continued to walk up and down the loft Night had come The three
persons whose arrival he so impatiently expected had not yet made their
appearance His walk became more and more nervous and irregular

On a sudden he stopped abruptly leaned his head towards the window and
listened His ear was quick as a savages

They are here he exclaimed and his fox like eye shone with diabolic
joy He had caught the sound of footstepsa mans and a horses
Hastening to the windowshutter of the loft he opened it cautiously
and saw the two young girls on horseback and the old soldier who served
them as a guide enter the innyard together

The night had set in dark and cloudy a high wind made the lights
flicker in the lanterns which were used to receive the new guests But
the description given to Morok had been so exact that it was impossible
to mistake them Sure of his prey he closed the window Having remained
in meditation for another quarter of an hourfor the purpose no doubt
of thoroughly digesting his projectshe leaned over the aperture from
which projected the ladder and called Goliath

Master replied a hoarse voice

Come up to me

Here I amjust come from the slaughterhouse with the meat

The steps of the ladder creaked as an enormous head appeared on a level
with the floor The newcomer who was more than six feet high and
gifted with herculean proportions had been wellnamed Goliath He was
hideous His squinting eyes were deep set beneath a low and projecting
forehead his reddish hair and beard thick and coarse as horsehair
gave his features a stamp of bestial ferocity between his broad jaws
armed with teeth which resembled fangs he held by one corner a piece of
raw beef weighing ten or twelve pounds finding it no doubt easier to
carry in that fashion whilst he used his hands to ascend the ladder
which bent beneath his weight

At length the whole of this tall and huge body issued from the aperture
Judging by his bullneck the astonishing breadth of his chest and
shoulders and the vast bulk of his arms and legs this giant need not
have feared to wrestle singlehanded with a bear He wore an old pair
of blue trousers with red stripes faced with tanned sheepsskin and
a vest or rather cuirass of thick leather which was here and there
slashed by the sharp claws of the animals

When he was fairly on the floor Goliath unclasped his fangs opened his
mouth and let fall the great piece of beef licking his bloodstained
lips with greediness Like many other mountebanks this species of
monster had began by eating raw meat at the fairs for the amusement of
the public Thence having gradually acquired a taste for this barbarous
food and uniting pleasure with profit he engaged himself to perform
the prelude to the exercises of Morok by devouring in the presence of
the crowd several pounds of raw flesh

My share and Deaths are below stairs and here are those of Cain
and Judas said Goliath pointing to the chunk of beef Where is
the cleaver that I may cut it in twoNo preference herebeast or
manevery gullet must have its own

Then rolling up one of the sleeves of his vest he exhibited a forearm
hairy as skin of a wolf and knotted with veins as large as ones thumb

I say master wheres the cleaverHe again began as he cast round
his eyes in search of that instrument But instead of replying to this
inquiry the Prophet put many questions to his disciple

Were you below when just now some new travellers arrived at the inn

Yes master I was coming from the slaughterhouse

Who are these travellers

Two young lasses mounted on a white horse and an old fellow with a
big moustache But the cleavermy beasts are hungry and so am Ithe
cleaver

Do you know where they have lodged these travellers

The host took them to the far end of the courtyard

The building which overlooks the fields

Yes masterbut the cleaver

A burst of frightful roaring shook the loft and interrupted Goliath

Hark to them he exclaimed hunger has driven the beasts wild If I
could roar I should do as they do I have never seen Judas and Cain as
they are tonight they leap in their cages as if theyd knock all to
pieces As for Death her eyes shine more than usual like candlespoor
Death

So these girls are lodged in the building at the end of the
courtyard resumed Morok without attending to the observations of
Goliath

Yes yesbut in the devils name where is the cleaver Since Karl
went away I have to do all the work and that makes our meals very
late

Did the old man remain with the young girls asked Morok

Goliath amazed that notwithstanding his importunities his master
should still appear to neglect the animals supper regarded the Prophet
with an increase of stupid astonishment

Answer you brute

If I am a brute I have a brutes strength said Goliath in a surly
tone and brute against brute I have not always come the worst off

I ask if the old man remained with the girls repeated Morok

Well thenno returned the giant The old man after leading his
horse to the stable asked for a tub and some water took his stand
under the porchand thereby the light of a lanternhe is washing
out clothes A man with a gray moustachepaddling in soapsuds like
a washerwomanits as if I were to feed canaries added Goliath
shrugging his shoulders with disdain But now Ive answered you
master let me attend to the beasts supperand looking round for
something he added where is the cleaver

After a moment of thoughtful silence the Prophet said to Goliath You
will give no food to the beasts this evening

At first the giant could not understand these words the idea was so
incomprehensible to him

What is your pleasure master said he

I forbid you to give any food to the beasts this evening

Goliath did not answer but he opened wide his squinting eyes folded
his hands and drew back a couple of steps

Well dost hear me said Morok with impatience Is it plain enough

Not feed when our meat is there and supper is already three hours
after time cried Goliath with everincreasing amazement

Obey and hold your tongue

You must wish something bad to happen this evening Hunger makes the
beasts furiousand me also

So much the better

Itll drive em mad

So much the better

How so much the betterBut

It is enough

But devil take me I am as hungry as the beasts

Eat thenwho prevents it Your supper is ready as you devour it raw

I never eat without my beasts nor they without me

I tell you again that if you dare give any food to the beastsI will
turn you away

Goliath uttered a low growl as hoarse as a bears and looked at the
Prophet with a mixture of anger and stupefaction

Morok having given his orders walked up and down the loft appearing
to reflect Then addressing himself to Goliath who was still plunged
in deep perplexity he said to him

Do you remember the burgomasters where I went to get my passport
signedToday his wife bought some books and a chaplet

Yes answered the giant shortly

Go and ask his servant if I may be sure to find the burgomaster early
tomorrow morning

What for

I may perhaps have something important to communicate at all events
say that I beg him not to leave home without seeing me

Good but may I feed the beasts before I go to the burgomastersonly
the panther who is most hungry Come master only poor Death just a
little morsel to satisfy her Cain and I and Judas can wait

It is the panther above all that I forbid you to feed Yes her
above all the rest

By the horns of the devil cried Goliath what is the matter with you
today I can make nothing of it It is a pity that Karls not here he
being cunning would help me to understand why you prevent the beasts
from eating when they are hungry

You have no need to understand it

Will not Karl soon come back

He has already come back

Where is he then

Off again

What can be going on here There is something in the wind Karl goes
and returns and goes again and

We are not talking of Karl but of you though hungry as a wolf you
are cunning as a fox and when it suits you as cunning as Karl And
changing on the sudden his tone and manner Morok slapped the giant
cordially on the shoulder

What am I cunning

The proof is that there are ten florins to earn tonightand you will
be keen enough to earn them I am sure

Why on those terms yesI am awake said the giant smiling with a
stupid selfsatisfied air What must I do for ten florins

You shall see

Is it hard work

You shall see Begin by going to the burgomastersbut first light the
fire in that stove He pointed to it with his finger

Yes master said Goliath somewhat consoled for the delay of his
supper by the hope of gaining ten florins

Put that iron bar in the stove added the Prophet to make it
redhot

Yes master

You will leave it there go to the burgomasters and return here to
wait for me

Yes master

You will keep the fire up in the stove

Yes master

Morok took a step away but recollecting himself he resumed You say
the old man is busy washing under the porch

Yes master

Forget nothing the iron bar in the firethe burgomasterand return
here to wait my orders So saying Morok descended by the trapdoor and
disappeared




CHAPTER IV MOROK and DAGOBERT

Goliath had not been mistaken for Dagobert was washing with that
imperturbable gravity with which he did everything else

When we remember the habits of a soldier afield we need not be
astonished at this apparent eccentricity Dagobert only thought of
sparing the scanty purse of the orphans and of saving them all care and
trouble so every evening when they came to a halt he devoted himself
to all sorts of feminine occupations But he was not now serving his
apprenticeship in these matters many times during his campaigns he
had industriously repaired the damage and disorder which a day of battle
always brings to the garments of the soldier for it is not enough to
receive a sabrecutthe soldier has also to mend his uniform for the
stroke which grazes the skin makes likewise a corresponding fissure in
the cloth

Therefore in the evening or on the morrow of a hardfought engagement
you will see the best soldiers always distinguished by their fine
military appearance take from their cartridgebox or knapsack a
housewife furnished with needles thread scissors buttons and other
such gear and apply themselves to all kinds of mending and darning
with a zeal that the most industrious workwoman might envy

We could not find a better opportunity to explain the name of Dagobert
given to Francis Baudoin the guide of the orphans at a time when he
was considered one of the handsomest and bravest horsegrenadiers of the
Imperial Guard

They had been fighting hard all day without any decisive advantage In
the evening the company to which our hero belonged was sent as outliers
to occupy the ruins of a deserted village Videttes being posted half
the troopers remained in saddle whilst the others having picketed
their horses were able to take a little rest Our hero had charged
valiantly that day without receiving any woundfor he counted as a mere
memento the deep scratch on his thigh which a kaiserlitz had inflicted
in awkwardly attempting an upward thrust with the bayonet

You donkey my new breeches the grenadier had exclaimed when he
saw the wide yawning rent which he instantly avenged by running the
Austrian through with a thrust scientifically administered For if he
showed a stoical indifference on the subject of injury to his skin it
was not so with regard to the ripping up of his best parade uniform

He undertook therefore the same evening at the bivouac to repair
this accident Selecting his best needle and thread from the stores of
his housewife and arming his finger with a thimble he began to play
the tailor by the light of the watchfire having first drawn off his
cavalryboots and also if it must be confessed the injured garment
itself which he turned the wrong side out the better to conceal the
stitches

This partial undress was certainly a breach of discipline but the
captain as he went his round could not forbear laughing at the sight
of the veteran soldier who gravely seated in a squatting position
with his grenadier cap on his regimental coat on his back his boots
by his side and his galligaskins in his lap was sewing with all the
coolness of a tailor upon his own shopboard

Suddenly a musketshot is heard and the videttes fall back upon the
detachment calling to arms To horse cries the captain in a voice
of thunder

In a moment the troopers are in their saddles the unfortunate clothes
mender having to lead the first rank there is no time to turn the
unlucky garment so he slips it on as well as he can wrong side out
and leaps upon his horse without even stopping to put on his boots

A party of Cossacks profiting by the cover of a neighboring wood had
attempted to surprise the detachment the fight was bloody and our hero
foamed with rage for he set much value on his equipments and the day
had been fatal to him Thinking of his torn clothes and lost boots he
hacked away with more fury than ever a bright moon illumined the scene
of action and his comrades were able to appreciate the brilliant valor
of our grenadier who killed two Cossacks and took an officer prisoner
with his own hand

After this skirmish in which the detachment had maintained its
position the captain drew up his men to compliment them on their
success and ordered the clothesmender to advance from the ranks that
he might thank him publicly for his gallant behavior Our hero could
have dispensed with this ovation but he was not the less obliged to
obey

Judge of the surprise of both captain and troopers when they saw this
tall and sternlooking figure ride forward at a slow pace with his
naked feet in the stirrups and naked legs pressing the sides of his
charger

The captain drew near in astonishment but recalling the occupation of
the soldier at the moment when the alarm was given he understood the
whole mystery Ha my old comrade he exclaimed thou art like King
Dagobertwearing thy breeches inside out

In spite of discipline this joke of the captains was received with
peals of illrepressed laughter But our friend sitting upright in his
saddle with his left thumb pressing the well adjusted reins and his
swordhilt carried close to his right thigh made a halfwheel and
returned to his place in the ranks without changing countenance after
he had duly received the congratulations of his captain From that day
Francis Baudoin received and kept the nickname of Dagobert

Now Dagobert was under the porch of the inn occupied in washing to the
great amazement of sundry beerdrinkers who observed him with curious
eyes from the large common room in which they were assembled

In truth it was a curious spectacle Dagobert had laid aside his gray
topcoat and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt with a vigorous hand
and good supply of soap he was rubbing away at a wet handkerchief
spread out on the board the end of which rested in a tub full of
water Upon his right arm tattooed with warlike emblems in red and
blue colors two scars deep enough to admit the finger were distinctly
visible No wonder then that while smoking their pipes and emptying
their pots of beer the Germans should display some surprise at the
singular occupation of this tall moustached baldheaded old man with
the forbidding countenancefor the features of Dagobert assumed a harsh
and grim expression when he was no longer in presence of the two girls

The sustained attention of which he saw himself the object began
to put him out of patience for his employment appeared to him quite
natural At this moment the Prophet entered the porch and perceiving
the soldier eyed him attentively for several seconds then approaching
he said to him in French in a rather sly tone It would seem comrade
that you have not much confidence in the washerwomen of Mockern

Dagobert without discontinuing his work half turned his head with a
frown looked askant at the Prophet and made him no answer

Astonished at this silence Morok resumed If I do not deceive myself
you are French my fine fellow The words on your arm prove it and your
military air stamps you as an old soldier of the Empire Therefore I
find that for a hero you have taken rather late to wear petticoats

Dagobert remained mute but he gnawed his moustache and plied the soap
with which he was rubbing the linen in a most hurried not to say angry
style for the face and words of the beasttamer displeased him
more than he cared to show Far from being discouraged the Prophet
continued I am sure my fine fellow that you are neither deaf nor
dumb why then will you not answer me

Losing all patience Dagobert turned abruptly round looked Morok full
in the face and said to him in a rough voice I dont know you I
dont wish to know you Chain up your curb And he betook himself again
to his washing

But we may make acquaintance We can drink a glass of Rhinewine
together and talk of our campaigns I also have seen some service I
assure you and that perhaps will induce you to be more civil

The veins on the bald forehead of Dagobert swelled perceptibly he saw
in the look and accent of the man who thus obstinately addressed him
something designedly provoking still he contained himself

I ask you why should you not drink a glass of wine with mewe could
talk about France I lived there a long time it is a fine country and
when I meet Frenchmen abroad I feel sociableparticularly when they
know how to use the soap as well as you do If I had a housewife Id
send her to your school

The sarcastic meaning was no longer disguised impudence and bravado
were legible in the Prophets looks Thinking that with such an
adversary the dispute might become serious Dagobert who wished to
avoid a quarrel at any price carried off his tub to the other end of
the porch hoping thus to put an end to the scene which was a sore
trial of his temper A flash of joy lighted up the tawny eyes of the
brutetamer The white circle which surrounded the pupil seemed to
dilate He ran his crooked fingers two or three times through his yellow
beard in token of satisfaction then he advanced slowly towards the
soldier accompanied by several idlers from the commonroom

Notwithstanding his coolness Dagobert amazed and incensed at the
impudent pertinacity of the Prophet was at first disposed to break
the washingboard on his head but remembering the orphans he thought
better of it

Folding his arms upon his breast Morok said to him in a dry and
insolent tone It is very certain you are not civil my man of suds
Then turning to the spectators he continued in German I tell this
Frenchman with his long moustache that he is not civil We shall
see what answer hell make Perhaps it will be necessary to give him
a lesson Heaven preserve me from quarrels he added with mock
compunction but the Lord has enlightened meI am his creature and I
ought to make his work respected

The mystical effrontery of this peroration was quite to the taste of
the idlers the fame of the Prophet had reached Mockern and as a
performance was expected on the morrow this prelude much amused the
company On hearing the insults of his adversary Dagobert could not
help saying in the German language I know German Speak in Germanthe
rest will understand you

New spectators now arrived and joined the first comers the adventure
had become exciting and a ring was formed around the two persons most
concerned

The Prophet resumed in German I said that you were not civil and I
now say you are grossly rude What do you answer to that

Nothing said Dagobert coldly as he proceeded to rinse out another
piece of linen

Nothing returned Morok that is very little I will be less brief
and tell you that when an honest man offers a glass of wine civilly
to a stranger that stranger has no right to answer with insolence and
deserves to be taught manners if he does so

Great drops of sweat ran down Dagoberts forehead and cheeks his
large imperial was incessantly agitated by nervous tremblingbut he
restrained himself Taking by two of the corners the handkerchief
which he had just dipped in the water he shook it wrung it and began
to hum to himself the burden of the old camp ditty

 Out of Tirlemonts fleahaunted den
 We ride forth next day of the sen
 With sabre in hand ah
 Goodbye to Amanda etc

The silence to which Dagobert had condemned himself almost choked him
this song afforded him some relief

Morok turning towards the spectators said to them with an air of
hypocritical restraint We knew that the soldiers of Napoleon were
pagans who stabled their horses in churches and offended the Lord a
hundred times a day and who for their sins were justly drowned in the
Beresino like so many Pharaohs but we did not know that the Lord
to punish these miscreants had deprived them of couragetheir single
gift Here is a man who has insulted in me a creature favored by
divine grace and who affects not to understand that I require an
apology or else

What said Dagobert without looking at the Prophet

Or you must give me satisfactionI have already told you that I have
seen service We shall easily find somewhere a couple of swords and to
morrow morning at peep of day we can meet behind a wall and show the
color of our bloodthat is if you have any in your veins

This challenge began to frighten the spectators who were not prepared
for so tragical a conclusion

What fighta very fine idea said one To get yourself both
locked up in prison the laws against duelling are strict

Particularly with relation to strangers or nondescripts added
another If they were to find you with arms in your hands the
burgomaster would shut you up in jail and keep you there two or three
months before trial

Would you be so mean as to denounce us asked Morok

No certainly not cried several do as you like We are only giving
you a friendly piece of advice by which you may profit if you think
fit

What care I for prison exclaimed the Prophet Only give me a couple
of swords and you shall see tomorrow morning if I heed what the
burgomaster can do or say

What would you do with two swords asked Dagobert quietly

When you have one in your grasp and I one in mine youd see The Lord
commands us to have a care of his honor

Dagobert shrugged his shoulders made a bundle of his linen in his
handkerchief dried his soap and put it carefully into a little
oilsilk bagthen whistling his favorite air of Tirlemont moved to
depart

The Prophet frowned he began to fear that his challenge would not be
accepted He advanced a step or so to encounter Dagobert placed himself
before him as if to intercept his passage and folding his arms and
scanning him from head to foot with bitter insolence said to him
So an old soldier of that archrobber Napoleon is only fit for a
washerwoman and refuses to fight

Yes he refuses to fight answered Dagobert in a firm voice but
becoming fearfully pale Never perhaps had the soldier given to his
orphan charge such a proof of tenderness and devotion For a man of
his character to let himself be insulted with impunity and refuse to
fightthe sacrifice was immense

So you are a cowardyou are afraid of meand you confess it

At these words Dagobert made as it were a pull upon himselfas if a
sudden thought had restrained him the moment he was about to rush on
the Prophet Indeed he had remembered the two maidens and the fatal
hindrance which a duel whatever might be the result would occasion
to their journey But the impulse of anger though rapid had been so
significantthe expression of the stern pale face bathed in sweat
was so daunting that the Prophet and the spectators drew back a step

Profound silence reigned for some seconds and then by a sudden
reaction Dagobert seemed to have gained the general interest One of
the company said to those near him This man is clearly not a coward

Oh no certainly not

It sometimes requires more courage to refuse a challenge than to accept
one

After all the Prophet was wrong to pick a quarrel about nothingand
with a stranger too

Yes for a stranger if he fought and was taken up would have a good
long imprisonment

And then you see added another he travels with two young girls
In such a position ought a man to fight about trifles If he should be
killed or put in prison what would become of them poor children

Dagobert turned towards the person who had pronounced these last words
He saw a stout fellow with a frank and simple countenance the soldier
offered him his hand and said with emotion

Thank you sir

The German shook cordially the hand which Dagobert had proffered and
holding it still in his own he added Do one thing sirshare a bowl
of punch with us We will make that mischiefmaking Prophet acknowledge
that he has been too touchy and he shall drink to your health

Up to this moment the brutetamer enraged at the issue of this scene
for he had hoped that the soldier would accept his challenge looked on
with savage contempt at those who had thus sided against him But now
his features gradually relaxed and believing it useful to his projects
to hide his disappointment he walked up to the soldier and said to
him with a tolerably good grace Well I give way to these gentlemen
I own I was wrong Your frigid air had wounded me and I was not master
of myself I repeat that I was wrong he added with suppressed
vexation the Lord commands humilityandI beg your pardon

This proof of moderation and regret was highly appreciated and loudly
applauded by the spectators He asks your pardon you cannot expect
more my brave fellow said one of them addressing Dagobert Come
let us all drink together we make you this offer franklyaccept it in
the same spirit

Yes yes accept it we beg you in the name of your pretty little
girls said the stout man hoping to decide Dagobert by this argument

Many thanks gentlemen replied he touched by the hearty advances of
the Germans you are very worthy people But when one is treated he
must offer drink in return

Well we will accept itthats understood Each his turn and all
fair We will pay for the first bowl you for the second

Poverty is no crime answered Dagobert and I must tell you honestly
that I cannot afford to pay for drink We have still a long journey to
go and I must not incur any useless expenses

The soldier spoke these words with such firm but simple dignity that
the Germans did not venture to renew their offer feeling that a man of
Dagoberts character could not accept it without humiliation

Well so much the worse said the stout man I should have liked to
clink glasses with you Goodnight my brave trooperGoodnightfor
it grows late and mine host of the Falcon will soon turn us out of
doors

Goodnight gentlemen replied Dagobert as he directed his steps
towards the stable to give his horse a second allowance of provender

Morok approached him and said in a voice even more humble than before
I have acknowledged my error and asked your pardon You have not
answered me do you still bear malice

If ever I meet you said the veteran in a suppressed and hollow tone
when my children have no longer need of me I will just say two words
to you and they will not be long ones

Then he turned his back abruptly on the Prophet who walked slowly out
of the yard

The inn of the White Falcon formed a parallelogram At one end rose
the principal dwelling at the other was a range of buildings which
contained sundry chambers let at a low price to the poorer sort of
travellers a vaulted passage opened a way through this latter into
the country finally on either side of the courtyard were sheds and
stables with lofts and garrets erected over them

Dagobert entering one of these stables took from off a chest the
portion of oats destined for his horse and pouring it into a winnowing
basket shook it as he approached Jovial

To his great astonishment his old travelling companion did not respond
with a joyous neigh to the rustle of the oats rattling on the wicker
work Alarmed he called Jovial with a friendly voice but the animal
instead of turning towards his master a look of intelligence and
impatiently striking the ground with his forefeet remained perfectly
motionless

More and more surprised the soldier went up to him By the dubious
light of a stablelantern he saw the poor animal in an attitude which
implied terrorhis legs half bent his head stretched forward his ears
down his nostrils quivering he had drawn tight his halter as if
he wished to break it in order to get away from the partition that
supported his rack and manger abundant coldsweat had speckled his hide
with bluish stains and his coat altogether looked dull and bristling
instead of standing out sleek and glossy from the dark background of
the stable lastly from time to time his body shook with convulsive
starts

Why old Jovial said the soldier as he put down the basket in
order to soothe his horse with more freedom you are like thy
masterafraidYes he added with bitterness as he thought of the
offence he had himself endured you are afraidthough no coward in
general

Notwithstanding the caresses and the voice of his master the horse
continued to give signs of terror he pulled somewhat less violently
at his halter and approaching his nostrils to the hand of Dagobert
sniffed audibly as if he doubted it were he

You dont know me cried Dagobert Something extraordinary must be
passing here

The soldier looked around him with uneasiness It was a large stable
faintly lighted by the lantern suspended from the roof which was
covered with innumerable cobwebs at the further end separated from
Jovial by some stalls with bars between were the three strong black
horses of the brutetameras tranquil as Jovial was frightened

Dagobert struck with this singular contrast of which he was soon
to have the explanation again caressed his horse and the animal
gradually reassured by his masters presence licked his hands rubbed
his head against him uttered a low neigh and gave him his usual tokens
of affection

Come come this is how I like to see my old Jovial said Dagobert
as he took up the winnowingbasket and poured its contents into the
manger Now eat with a good appetite for we have a long days march
tomorrow and above all no more of these foolish fears about nothing
If thy comrade Spoilsport was here he would keep you in heart but
he is along with the children and takes care of them in my absence
Come eat Instead of staring at me in that way

But the horse having just touched the oats with his mouth as if in
obedience to his master returned to them no more and began to nibble
at the sleeve of Dagoberts coat

Come come my poor Jovial there is something the matter with you You
have generally such a good appetite and now you leave your corn Tis
the first time this has happened since our departure said the soldier
who was now growing seriously uneasy for the issue of his journey
greatly depended on the health and vigor of his horse

Just then a frightful roaring so near that it seemed to come from the
stable in which they were gave so violent a shock to Jovial that with
one effort he broke his halter leaped over the bar that marked his
place and rushing at the open door escaped into the courtyard

Dagobert had himself started at the suddenness of this wild and fearful
sound which at once explained to him the cause of his horses terror
The adjoining stable was occupied by the itinerant menagerie of the
brutetamer and was only separated by the partition which supported
the mangers The three horses of the Prophet accustomed to these
howlings had remained perfectly quiet

Good said the soldier recovering himself I understand it now
Jovial has heard another such roar before and he can scent the animals
of that insolent scoundrel It is enough to frighten him added he
as he carefully collected the oats from the manger once in another
stable and there must be others in this place he will no longer leave
his peck and we shall be able to start early tomorrow morning

The terrified horse after running and galloping about the yard
returned at the voice of the soldier who easily caught him by the
broken halter and a hostler whom Dagobert asked if there was another
vacant stable having pointed out one that was only intended for a
single animal Jovial was comfortably installed there

When delivered from his ferocious neighbors the horse became tranquil
as before and even amused himself much at the expense of Dagoberts
top coat which thanks to his tricks might have afforded immediate
occupation for his masters needle if the latter had not been fully
engaged in admiring the eagerness with which Jovial dispatched his
provender Completely reassured on his account the soldier shut the
door of the stable and proceeded to get his supper as quickly as
possible in order to rejoin the orphans whom he reproached himself
with having left so long




CHAPTER V ROSE AND BLANCHE

The orphans occupied a dilapidated chamber in one of the most remote
wings of the inn with a single window opening upon the country A bed
without curtains a table and two chairs composed the more than modest
furniture of this retreat which was now lighted by a lamp On the
table which stood near the window was deposited the knapsack of the
soldier

The great Siberian dog who was lying close to the door had already
twice uttered a deep growl and turned his head towards the windowbut
without giving any further affect to this hostile manifestation

The two sisters half recumbent in their bed were clad in long white
wrappers buttoned at the neck and wrists They wore no caps but their
beautiful chestnut hair was confined at the temples by a broad piece
of tape so that it might not get tangled during the night These white
garments and the white fillet that like a halo encircled their brows
gave to their fresh and blooming faces a still more candid expression

The orphans laughed and chatted for in spite of some early sorrows
they still retained the ingenuous gayety of their age The remembrance
of their mother would sometimes make them sad but this sorrow had in it
nothing bitter it was rather a sweet melancholy to be sought instead
of shunned For them this adored mother was not deadshe was only
absent

Almost as ignorant as Dagobert with regard to devotional exercises for
in the desert where they had lived there was neither church nor priest
their faith as was already said consisted in thisthat God just and
good had so much pity for the poor mothers whose children were left
on earth that he allowed them to look down upon them from highest
heavento see them always to hear them always and sometimes to
send fair guardian angels to protect therein Thanks to this guileless
illusion the orphans persuaded that their mother incessantly watched
over them felt that to do wrong would be to afflict her and to
forfeit the protection of the good angelsThis was the entire theology
of Rose and Blanchea creed sufficient for such pure and loving souls

Now on the evening in question the two sisters chatted together whilst
waiting for Dagobert Their theme interested them much for since
some days they had a secret a great secret which often quickened the
beatings of their innocent hearts often agitated their budding bosoms
changed to bright scarlet the roses on their cheeks and infused a
restless and dreamy langour into the soft blue of their large eyes

Rose this evening occupied the edge of the couch with her rounded
arms crossed behind her head which was half turned towards her sister
Blanche with her elbow resting on the bolster looked at her smilingly
and said Do you think he will come again tonight

Oh yes certainly He promised us yesterday

He is so good he would not break his promise

And so handsome with his long fair curls

And his namewhat a charming nameHow well it suits his face

And what a sweet smile and soft voice when he says to us taking us by
the hand My children bless God that he has given you one soul What
others seek elsewhere you will find in yourselves

Since your two hearts he added only make one

What pleasure to remember his words sister

We are so attentive When I see you listening to him it is as if I
saw myself my dear little mirror said Rose laughing and kissing her
sisters forehead Wellwhen he speaks youror rather our eyesare
wide wide open our lips moving as if we repeated every word after him
It is no wonder we forget nothing that he says

And what he says is so grand so noble and generous

Then my sister as he goes on talking what good thoughts rise within
us If we could but always keep them in mind

Do not be afraid they will remain in our hearts like little birds in
their mothers nests

And how lucky it is Rose that he loves us both at the same time

He could not do otherwise since we have but one heart between us

How could he love Rose without loving Blanche

What would have become of the poor neglected one

And then again he would have found it so difficult to choose

We are so much like one another

So to save himself that trouble said Rose laughing he has chosen
us both

And is it not the best way He is alone to love us we are two together
to think of him

Only he must not leave us till we reach Paris

And in Paris toowe must see him there also

Oh above all at Paris it will be good to have him with usand
Dagobert tooin that great city Only think Blanche how beautiful it
must be

Parisit must be like a city all of gold

A city where every one must be happy since it is so beautiful

But ought we poor orphans dare so much as to enter it How people
will look at us

Yesbut every one there is happy every one must be good also

They will love us

And besides we shall be with our friend with the fair hair and blue
eyes

He has yet told us nothing of Paris

He has not thought of it we must speak to him about it this very
night

If he is in the mood for talking Often you know he likes best to gaze
on us in silencehis eyes on our eyes

Yes In those moments his look recalls to me the gaze of our dear
mother

And as she sees it all how pleased she must be at what has happened
to us

Because when we are so much beloved we must I hope deserve it

See what a vain thing it is said Blanche smoothing with her slender
fingers the parting of the hair on her sisters forehead

After a moments reflection Rose said to her Dont you think we
should relate all this to Dagobert

If you think so let us do it

We tell him everything as we told everything to mother Why should we
conceal this from him

Especially as it is something which gives us so much pleasure

Do you not find that since we have known our friend our hearts beat
quicker and stronger

Yes they seem to be more full

The reason why is plain enough our friend fills up a good space in
them

Well we will do best to tell Dagobert what a lucky star ours is

You are right At this moment the dog gave another deep growl

Sister said Rose as she pressed closer to Blanche there is the dog
growling again What can be the matter with him

Spoilsport do not growl Come hither said Blanche striking with
her little hand on the side of the bed

The dog rose again growled deeply and came to lay his great
intelligent looking head on the counterpane still obstinately casting
a sidelong glance at the window the sisters bent over him to pat
his broad forehead in the centre of which was a remarkable bump the
certain sign of extreme purity of race

What makes you growl so Spoilsport said Blanche pulling him gently
by the earseh my good dog

Poor beast he is always so uneasy when Dagobert is away

It is true one would think he knows that he then has a double charge
over us

Sister it seems to me Dagobert is late in coming to say goodnight

No doubt he is attending to Jovial

That makes me think that we did not bid goodnight to dear old Jovial

I am sorry for it

Poor beast he seems so glad when he licks our hands One would think
that he thanked us for our visit

Luckily Dagobert will have wished him goodnight for us

Good Dagobert he is always thinking of us How he spoils us We remain
idle and he has all the trouble

How can we prevent it

What a pity that we are not rich to give him a little rest

We rich Alas my sister we shall never be anything but poor orphans

Oh theres the medal

Doubtless there is some hope attached to it else we should not have
made this long journey

Dagobert has promised to tell us all this evening

She was prevented from continuing for two of the windowpanes flew to
pieces with a loud crash

The orphans with a cry of terror threw themselves into each others
arms whilst the dog rushed towards the window barking furiously

Pale trembling motionless with affright clasping each other in a
close embrace the two sisters held their breath in their extreme fear
they durst not even cast their eyes in the direction of the window
The dog with his forepaws resting on the sill continued to bark with
violence

Alas what can it be murmured the orphans And Dagobert not here

Hark cried Rose suddenly seizing Blanche by the arm harksome
one coming up the stairs

Good heaven it does not sound like the tread of Dagobert Do you not
hear what heavy footsteps

Quick come Spoilsport and defend us cried the two sisters at
once in an agony of alarm

The boards of the wooden staircase really creaked beneath the weight
of unusually heavy footsteps and a singular kind of rustling was
heard along the thin partition that divided the chamber from the
landingplace Then a ponderous mass falling against the door of the
room shook it violently and the girls at the very height of terror
looked at each other without the power of speech

The door opened It was Dagobert

At the sight of him Rose and Blanche joyfully exchanged a kiss as if
they had just escaped from a great danger

What is the matter why are you afraid asked the soldier in surprise

Oh if you only knew said Rose panting as she spoke for both her
own heart and her sisters beat with violence

If you knew what has just happened We did not recognize your
footstepsthey seemed so heavyand then that noise behind the
partition

Little frightened doves that you are I could not run up the stairs
like a boy of fifteen seeing that I carried my bed upon my backa
straw mattress that I have just flung down before your door to sleep
there as usual

Bless me how foolish we must be sister not to have thought of
that said Rose looking at Blanche And their pretty faces which had
together grown pale together resumed their natural color

During this scene the dog still resting against the window did not
cease barking a moment

What makes Spoilsport bark in that direction my children said the
soldier

We do not know Two of our windowpanes have just been broken That is
what first frightened us so much

Without answering a word Dagobert flew to the window opened it quickly
pushed back the shutter and leaned out

He saw nothing it was a dark night He listened but heard only the
moaning of the wind

Spoilsport said he to his dog pointing to the open window leap
out old fellow and search The faithful animal took one mighty spring
and disappeared by the window raised only about eight feet above the
ground

Dagobert still leaning over encouraged his dog with voice and gesture
Search old fellow search If there is any one there pin himyour
fangs are strongand hold him fast till I come

But Spoilsport found no one They heard him go backwards and forwards
snuffing on every side and now and then uttering a low cry like a hound
at fault

There is no one my good dog thats clear or you would have had him
by the throat ere this Then turning to the maidens who listened to
his words and watched his movements with uneasiness My girls said
he how were these panes broken Did you not remark

No Dagobert we were talking together when we heard a great crash and
then the glass fell into the room

It seemed to me added Rose as if a shutter had struck suddenly
against the window

Dagobert examined the shutter and observed a long movable hook
designed to fasten it on the inside

It blows hard said he the wind must have swung round the shutter
and this hook broke the window Yes yes that is it What interest
could anybody have to play such a sorry trick Then speaking to Spoil
sport he asked Well my good fellow is there no one

The dog answered by a bark which the soldier no doubt understood as a
negative for he continued Well then come back Make the roundyou
will find some door openyou are never at a loss

The animal followed this advice After growling for a few seconds
beneath the window he set off at a gallop to make the circuit of the
buildings and come back by the courtyard

Be quite easy my children said the soldier as he again drew near
the orphans it was only the wind

We were a good deal frightened said Rose

I believe you But now I think of it this draught is likely to give
you cold And seeking to remedy this inconvenience he took from a
chair the reindeer pelisse and suspended it from the springcatch
of the curtainless window using the skirts to stop up as closely as
possible the two openings made by the breaking of the panes

Thanks Dagobert how good you are We were very uneasy at not seeing
you

Yes you were absent longer than usual But what is the matter with
you added Rose only just then perceiving that his countenance was
disturbed and pallid for he was still under the painful influence of
the brawl with Morok how pale you are

Me my petsOh nothing

Yes I assure you your countenance is quite changed Rose is right

I tell you there is nothing the matter answered the soldier not
without some embarrassment for he was little used to deceive till
finding an excellent excuse for his emotion he added If I do look at
all uncomfortable it is your fright that has made me so for indeed it
was my fault

Your fault

Yes for if I had not lost so much time at supper I should have been
here when the window was broken and have spared you the fright

Anyhow you are here now and we think no more of it

Why dont you sit down

I will my children for we have to talk together said Dagobert as
he drew a chair close to the head of the bed

Now tell me are you quite awake he added trying to smile in order
to reassure them Are those large eyes properly open

Look Dagobert cried the two girls smiling in their turn and
opening their blue eyes to the utmost extent

Well well said the soldier they are yet far enough from shutting
besides it is only nine oclock

We also have something to tell Dagobert resumed Rose after
exchanging glances with her sister

Indeed

A secret to tell you

A secret

Yes to be sure

Ah and a very great secret added Rose quite seriously

A secret which concerns us both resumed Blanche

Faith I should think so What concerns the one always concerns the
other Are you not always as the saying goes two faces under one
hood

Truly how can it be otherwise when you put our heads under the great
hood of your pelisse said Rose laughing

There they are again mockingbirds One never has the last word with
them Come ladies your secret since a secret there is

Speak sister said Rose

No miss it is for you to speak You are today on duty as eldest
and such an important thing as telling a secret like that you talk of
belongs of right to the elder sister Come I am listening to you
added the soldier as he forced a smile the better to conceal from
the maidens how much he still felt the unpunished affronts of the brute
tamer

It was Rose who as Dagobert said was doing duty as eldest that spoke
for herself and for her sister




CHAPTER VI THE SECRET

First of all good Dagobert said Rose in a gracefully caressing
manner as we are going to tell our secretyou must promise not to
scold us

You will not scold your darlings will you added Blanche in a no
less coaxing voice

Granted replied Dagobert gravely particularly as I should not well
know how to set about itbut why should I scold you

Because we ought perhaps to have told you sooner what we are going to
tell you

Listen my children said Dagobert sententiously after reflecting a
moment on this case of conscience one of two things must be Either
you were right or else you were wrong to hide this from me If you
were right very well if you were wrong it is done so lets say no
more about it Go onI am all attention

Completely reassured by this luminous decision Rose resumed while she
exchanged a smile with her sister

Only think Dagobert for two successive nights we have had a visitor

A visitor cried the soldier drawing himself up suddenly in his
chair

Yes a charming visitorhe is so very fair

Fairthe devil cried Dagobert with a start

Yes fairand with blue eyes added Blanche

Blue eyesblue devils and Dagobert again bounded on his seat

Yes blue eyesas long as that resumed Rose placing the tip of one
forefinger about the middle of the other

Zounds they might be as long as that said the veteran indicating
the whole length of his term from the elbow they might be as long as
that and it would have nothing to do with it Fair and with blue eyes
Pray what may this mean young ladies and Dagobert rose from his seat
with a severe and painfully unquiet look

There now Dagobert you have begun to scold us already

Just at the very commencement added Blanche

Commencementwhat is there to be a sequel a finish

A finish we hope not said Rose laughing like mad

All we ask is that it should last forever added Blanche sharing in
the hilarity of her sister

Dagobert looked gravely from one to the other of the two maidens as if
trying to guess this enigma but when he saw their sweet innocent faces
gracefully animated by a frank ingenuous laugh he reflected that they
would not be so gay if they had any serious matter for selfreproach
and he felt pleased at seeing them so merry in the midst of their
precarious position

Laugh on my children he said I like so much to see you laugh

Then thinking that was not precisely the way in which he ought to treat
the singular confession of the young girls he added in a gruff voice
Yes I like to see you laughbut not when you receive fair visitors
with blue eyes young ladiesCome acknowledge that Im an old fool to
listen to such nonsenseyou are only making game of me

Nay what we tell you is quite true

You know we never tell stories added Rose

They are rightthey never fib said the soldier in renewed
perplexity

But how the devil is such a visit possible I sleep before your
doorSpoilsport sleeps under your windowand all the blue eyes and
fair locks in the world must come in by one of those two waysand if
they had tried it the dog and I who have both of us quick ears would
have received their visits after our fashion But come children pray
speak to the purpose Explain yourselves

The two sisters who saw by the expression of Dagoberts countenance
that he felt really uneasy determined no longer to trifle with his
kindness They exchanged a glance and Rose taking in her little hand
the coarse broad palm of the veteran said to him Come do not plague
yourself We will tell you all about the visits of our friend Gabriel

There you are againHe has a name then

Certainly he has a name It is Gabriel

Is it not a pretty name Dagobert Oh you will see and love as we do
our beautiful Gabriel

Ill love your beautiful Gabriel will I said the veteran shaking
his headLove your beautiful Gabrielthats as it may be I must
first know Then interrupting himself he added It is queer That
reminds me of something

Of what Dagobert

Fifteen years ago in the last letter that your father on his return
from France brought me from my wife she told me that poor as she was
and with our little growing Agricola on her hands she had taken in
a poor deserted child with the face of a cherub and the name of
Gabrieland only a short time since I heard of him again

And from whom then

You shall know that by and by

Well thensince you have a Gabriel of your ownthere is the more
reason that you should love ours

Yours but who is yours I am on thorns till you tell me

You know Dagobert resumed Rose that Blanche and I are accustomed
to fall asleep holding each other by the hand

Yes yes I have often seen you in your cradle I was never tired of
looking at you it was so pretty

Well thentwo nights ago we had just fallen asleep when we
beheld

Oh it was in a dream cried Dagobert Since you were asleep it was
in a dream

Certainly in a dreamhow else would you have it

Pray let my sister go on with her tale

All well and good said the soldier with a sigh of satisfaction
well and good To be sure I was tranquil enough in any
casebecausebut stillI like it better to be a dream Continue my
little Rose

Once asleep we both dreamt the same thing

What both the same

Yes Dagobert for the next morning when we awoke we related our two
dreams to each other

And they were exactly alike

Thats odd enough my children and what was this dream all about

In our dream Blanche and I were seated together when we saw enter a
beautiful angel with a long white robe fair locks blue eyes and so
handsome and benign a countenance that we elapsed our hands as if
to pray to him Then he told us in a soft voice that he was called
Gabriel that our mother had sent him to be our guardian angel and that
he would never abandon us

And then added Blanche he took us each by the hand and bending
his fair face over us looked at us for a long time in silence with
so much goodnesswith so much goodness that we could not withdraw our
eyes from his

Yes resumed Rose and his look seemed by turns to attract us or
to go to our hearts At length to our great sorrow Gabriel quitted us
having told us that we should see him again the following night

And did he make his appearance

Certainly Judge with what impatience we waited the moment of sleep to
see if our friend would return and visit us in our slumbers

Humph said Dagobert scratching his forehead this reminds me young
ladies that you kept on rubbing your eyes last evening and pretending
to be half asleep I wager it was all to send me away the sooner and
to get to your dream as fast as possible

Yes Dagobert

The reason being you could not say to me as you would to Spoilsport
Lie down Dagobert Wellso your friend Gabriel came back

Yes and this time he talked to us a great deal and gave us in the
name of our mother such touching such noble counsels that the next
day Rose and I spent our whole time in recalling every word of our
guardian angeland his face and his look

This reminds me again young ladies that you were whispering all along
the road this morning and that when I spoke of white you answered
black

Yes Dagobert we were thinking of Gabriel

And ever since we love him as well as he loves us

But he is only one between both of you

Was not our mother one between us

And you Dagobertare you not also one for us both

True true And yet do you know I shall finish by being jealous of
that Gabriel

You are our friend by dayhe is our friend by night

Lets understand it clearly If you talk of him all day and dream of
him all night what will there remain for me

There will remain for you your two orphans whom you love so much
said Rose

And who have only you left upon earth added Blanche in a caressing
tongue

Humph humph thats right coax the old man over Nay believe me my
children added the soldier tenderly I am quite satisfied with my
lot I can afford to let you have your Gabriel I felt sure that Spoil
sport and myself could take our rest in quiet After all there is
nothing so astonishing in what you tell me your first dream struck your
fancy and you talked so much about it that you had a second nor should
I be surprised if you were to see this fine fellow a third time

Oh Dagobert do not make a jest of it They are only dreams but
we think our mother sends them to us Did she not tell us that orphan
children were watched over by guardian angels Well Gabriel is our
guardian angel he will protect us and he will protect you also

Very kind of him to think of me but you see my dear children for the
matter of defence I prefer the dog he is less fair than your angel
but he has better teeth and that is more to be depended on

How provoking you are Dagobertalways jesting

It is true you can laugh at everything

Yes I am astonishingly gay I laugh with my teeth shut in the style
of old Jovial Come children dont scold me I know I am wrong The
remembrance of your dear mother is mixed with this dream and you do
well to speak of it seriously Besides added he with a grave air
dreams will sometimes come true In Spain two of the Empresss
dragoons comrades of mine dreamt the night before their death that
they would be poisoned by the monksand so it happened If you continue
to dream of this fair angel Gabriel it isit iswhy it is because
you are amused by it and as you have none too many pleasures in the
daytime you may as well get an agreeable sleep at night But now my
children I have also much to tell you it will concern your mother
promise me not to be sad

Be satisfied when we think of her we are not sad though serious

That is well For fear of grieving you I have always delayed the
moment of telling what your poor mother would have confided to you as
soon as you were no longer children But she died before she had time to
do so and that which I have to tell broke her heartas it nearly
did mine I put off this communication as long as I could taking for
pretext that I would say nothing till we came to the field of battle
where your father was made prisoner That gave me time but the moment
is now come I can shuffle it off no longer

We listen Dagobert responded the two maidens with an attentive and
melancholy air

After a moments silence during which he appeared to reflect the
veteran thus addressed the young girls

Your father General Simon was the son of a workman who remained a
workman for notwithstanding all that the general could say or do the
old man was obstinate in not quitting his trade He had a heart of gold
and a head of iron just like his son You may suppose my children
that when your father who had enlisted as a private soldier became a
general and a count of the empire it was not without toil or without
glory

A count of the Empire what is that Dagobert

Flummerya title which the Emperor gave over and above the promotion
just for the sake of saying to the people whom he loved because he was
one of them Here children You wish to play at nobility You shall be
nobles You wish to play at royalty You shall be kings Take what you
likenothing is too good for youenjoy yourselves

Kings said the two girls joining their hands in admiration

Kings of the first water Oh he was no niggard of his crowns our
Emperor I had a bedfellow of mine a brave soldier who was afterwards
promoted to be king This flattered us for if it was not one it was
the other And so at this game your father became count but count or
not he was one of the best and bravest generals of the army

He was handsome was he not Dagobertmother always said so

Oh yes indeed he wasbut quite another thing from your fair guardian
angel Picture to yourself a fine dark man who looked splendid in his
full uniform and could put fire into the soldiers hearts With him to
lead we would have charged up into Heaven itselfthat is if Heaven
had permitted it added Dagobert not wishing to wound in any way the
religious beliefs of the orphans

And father was as good as he was brave Dagobert

Good my children Yes I should say soHe could bend a horseshoe in
his hand as you would bend a card and the day he was taken prisoner
he had cut down the Prussian artillerymen on their very cannon With
strength and courage like that how could he be otherwise than good It
is then about nineteen years ago not far from this placeon the spot
I showed you before we arrived at the villagethat the general
dangerously wounded fell from his horse I was following him at
the time and ran to his assistance Five minutes after we were made
prisonersand by whom think youby a Frenchman

A Frenchman

Yes an emigrant marquis a colonel in the service of Russia answered
Dagobert with bitterness And so when this marquis advanced towards
us and said to the general Surrender sir to a countrymanA
Frenchman who fights against France replied the general is no
longer my countryman he is a traitor and Id never surrender to a
traitor And wounded though he was he dragged himself up to a Russian
grenadier and delivered him his sabre saying I surrender to you my
brave fellow The marquis became pale with rage at it

The orphans looked at each other with pride and a rich crimson mantled
their cheeks as they exclaimed Oh our brave father

Ah those children said Dagobert as he proudly twirled his
moustache One sees they have soldiers blood in their veins Well
he continued we were now prisoners The generals last horse had been
killed under him and to perform the journey he mounted Jovial who
had not been wounded that day We arrived at Warsaw and there it was
that the general first saw your mother She was called the Pearl of
Warsaw that is saying everything Now he who admired all that is good
and beautiful fell in love with her almost immediately and she loved
him in return but her parents had promised her to anotherand that
other was the same

Dagobert was unable to proceed Rose uttered a piercing cry and pointed
in terror to the window




CHAPTER VII THE TRAVELER

Upon the cry of the young girl Dagobert rose abruptly

What is the matter Rose

Therethere she said pointing to the window I thought I saw a
hand move the pelisse

She had not concluded these words before Dagobert rushed to the window
and opened it tearing down the mantle which had been suspended from
the fastening

It was still dark night and the wind was blowing hard The soldier
listened but could hear nothing

Returning to fetch the lamp from the table he shaded the flame with
his hand and strove to throw the light outside Still he saw nothing
Persuaded that a gust of wind had disturbed and shaken the pelisse and
that Rose had been deceived by her own fears he again shut the window

Be satisfied children The wind is very high it is that which lifted
the corner of the pelisse

Yet methought I saw plainly the fingers which had hold of it said
Rose still trembling

I was looking at Dagobert said Blanche and I saw nothing

There was nothing to see my children the thing is clear enough The
window is at least eight feet above the ground none but a giant could
reach it without a ladder Now had any one used a ladder there would
not have been time to remove it for as soon as Rose cried out I ran
to the window and when I held out the light I could see nothing

I must have been deceived said Rose

You may be sure sister it was only the wind added Blanche

Then I beg pardon for having disturbed you my good Dagobert

Never mind replied the soldier musingly I am only sorry that Spoil
sport is not come back He would have watched the window and that would
have quite tranquillized you But he no doubt scented the stable of his
comrade Jovial and will have called in to bid him goodnight on the
road I have half a mind to go and fetch him

Oh no Dagobert do not leave us alone cried the maidens we are
too much afraid

Well the dog is not likely to remain away much longer and I am sure
we shall soon hear him scratching at the door so we will continue our
story said Dagobert as he again seated himself near the head of the
bed but this time with his face towards the window

Now the general was prisoner at Warsaw continued he and in love
with your mother whom they wished to marry to another In 1814 we
learned the finish of the war the banishment of the Emperor to the Isle
of Elba and the return of the Bourbons In concert with the Prussians
and Russians who had brought them back they had exiled the Emperor
Learning all this your mother said to the general The war is
finished you are free but your Emperor is in trouble You owe
everything to him go and join him in his misfortunes I know not when
we shall meet again but I shall never marry any one but you I am yours
till deathBefore he set out the general called me to him and said
Dagobert remain here Mademoiselle Eva may have need of you to
fly from her family if they should press too hard upon her our
correspondence will have to pass through your hands at Paris I shall
see your wife and son I will comfort them and tell them you are my
friend

Always the same said Rose with emotion as she looked affectionately
at Dagobert

As faithful to the father and mother as to their children added
Blanche

To love one was to love them all replied the soldier Well the
general joined the Emperor at Elba I remained at Warsaw concealed in
the neighborhood of your mothers house I received the letters and
conveyed them to her clandestinely In one of those lettersI feel
proud to tell you of it my childrenthe general informed me that the
Emperor himself had remembered me

What did he know you

A little I flatter myselfOh Dagobert said he to your father
who was talking to him about me a horsegrenadier of my old guarda
soldier of Egypt and Italy battered with woundsan old daredevil
whom I decorated with my own hand at WagramI have not forgotten
himI vow children when your mother read that to me I cried like a
fool

The Emperorwhat a fine golden face he has on the silver cross with
the red ribbon that you would sometimes show us when we behaved well

That crossgiven by himis my relic It is there in my knapsack with
whatever we have of valueour little purse and papers But to return
to your mother it was a great consolation to her when I took her
letters from the general or talked with her about himfor she suffered
muchoh so much In vain her parents tormented and persecuted her
she always answered I will never marry any one but General Simon A
spirited woman I can tell youresigned but wonderfully courageous
One day she received a letter from the general he had left the Isle of
Elba with the Emperor the war had again broken out a short campaign
but as fierce as ever and heightened by soldiers devotion In that
campaign of France my children especially at Montmirail your father
fought like a lion and his division followed his example it was no
longer valorit was frenzy He told me that in Champagne the peasants
killed so many of those Prussians that their fields were manured with
them for years Men women children all rushed upon them Pitchforks
stones mattocks all served for the slaughter It was a true wolf
hunt

The veins swelled on the soldiers forehead and his cheeks flushed as
he spoke for this popular heroism recalled to his memory the sublime
enthusiasm of the wars of the republicthose armed risings of a whole
people from which dated the first steps of his military career as the
triumphs of the Empire were the last days of his service

The orphans too daughters of a soldier and a brave woman did not
shrink from the rough energy of these words but felt their cheeks glow
and their hearts beat tumultuously

How happy we are to be the children of so brave a father cried
Blanche

It is a happiness and an honor too my childrenfor the evening of the
battle of Montmirail the Emperor to the joy of the whole army made
your father Duke of Ligny and Marshal of France

Marshal of France said Rose in astonishment without understanding
the exact meaning of the words

Duke of Ligny added Blanche with equal surprise

Yes Peter Simon the son of a workman became duke and marshalthere
is nothing higher except a king resumed Dagobert proudly Thats how
the Emperor treated the sons of the people and therefore the people
were devoted to him It was all very fine to tell them Your Emperor
makes you food for cannon Stuff replied the people who are no
fools another would make us food for misery We prefer the cannon
with the chance of becoming captain or colonel marshal kingor
invalid thats better than to perish with hunger cold and age on
straw in a garret after toiling forty years for others

Even in Franceeven in Paris that beautiful citydo you mean to say
there are poor people who die of hunger and misery Dagobert

Even in Paris Yes my children therefore I come back to the point
the cannon is better With it one has the chance of becoming like your
father duke and marshal when I say duke and marshal I am partly right
and partly wrong for the title and the rank were not recognized in
the end because after Montmirail came a day of gloom a day of great
mourning when as the general has told me old soldiers like myself
weptyes wepton the evening of a battle That day my children was
Waterloo

There was in these simple words of Dagobert an expression of such deep
sorrow that it thrilled the hearts of the orphans

Alas resumed the soldier with a sigh there are days which seem
to have a curse on them That same day at Waterloo the general fell
covered with wounds at the head of a division of the Guards When he
was nearly cured which was not for a long time he solicited permission
to go to St Helenaanother island at the far end of the world to
which the English had carried the Emperor to torture him at their
leisure for if he was very fortunate in the first instance he had to
go through a deal of hard rubs at last my poor children

If you talk in that way you will make us cry Dagobert

There is cause enough for itthe Emperor suffered so much He bled
cruelly at the heart believe me Unfortunately the general was not with
him at St Helena he would have been one more to console him but
they would not allow him to go Then exasperated like so many others
against the Bourbons the general engaged in a conspiracy to recall the
son of the Emperor He relied especially on one regiment nearly all
composed of his old soldiers and he went down to a place in Picardy
where they were then in garrison but the conspiracy had already been
divulged Arrested the moment of his arrival the general was taken
before the colonel of the regiment And this colonel said the soldier
after a brief pause who do you think it was again Bah it would be
too long to tell you all and would only make you more sad but it was
a man whom your father had many reasons to hate When he found himself
face to face with him he said if you are not a coward you will give
me one hours liberty and we will fight to the death I hate you for
this I despise you for thatand so on The colonel accepted the
challenge and gave your father his liberty till the morrow The duel
was a desperate one the colonel was left for dead on the spot

Merciful heaven

The general was yet wiping his sword when a faithful friend came to
him and told him he had only just time to save himself In fact he
happily succeeded in leaving Franceyes happilyfor a fortnight
after he was condemned to death as a conspirator

What misfortunes good heaven

There was some luck however in the midst of his troubles Your mother
had kept her promise bravely and was still waiting for him She had
written to him The Emperor first and me next both unable to do
anything more for the Emperor nor even for his son the general
banished from France set out for Warsaw Your mother had lost her
parents and was now free they were marriedand I am one of the
witnesses to the marriage

You are right Dagobert that was great happiness in the midst of great
misfortunes

Yes they were very happy but as it happened with all good hearts
the happier they were themselves the more they felt for the sorrows
of othersand there was quite enough to grieve them at Warsaw The
Russians had again begun to treat the Poles as their slaves your brave
mother though of French origin was a Pole in heart and soul she spoke
out boldly what others did not dare speak in a whisper and all the
unfortunate called her their protecting angel That was enough to
excite the suspicions of the Russian governor One day a friend of the
generals formerly a colonel in the lancers a brave and worthy man
was condemned to be exiled to Siberia for a military plot against the
Russians He took refuge in your fathers house and lay hid there but
his retreat was discovered During the next night a party of Cossacks
commanded by an officer and followed by a travellingcarriage arrive
at our door they rouse the general from his sleep and take him away
with them

Oh heaven what did they mean to do with him

Conduct him out of the Russian dominions with a charge never to
return on pain of perpetual imprisonment His last words were
Dagobert I entrust to thee my wife and childfor it wanted yet some
months of the time when you were to be born Well notwithstanding that
they exiled your mother to Siberia it was an opportunity to get rid of
her she did too much good at Warsaw and they feared her accordingly
Not content with banishing her they confiscated all her property the
only favor she could obtain was that I should accompany her and had
it not been for Jovial whom the general had given to me she would have
had to make the journey on foot It was thus with her on horseback
and I leading her as I lead you my children that we arrived at the
povertystricken village where three months after you poor little
things were born

And our father

It was impossible for him to return to Russia impossible for your
mother to think of flight with two children impossible for the general
to write to her as he knew not where she was

So since that time you have had no news of him

Yes my childrenonce we had news

And by whom

After a moments silence Dagobert resumed with a singular expression of
countenance By whomby one who is not like other men Yesthat
you may understand me better I will relate to you an extraordinary
adventure which happened to your father during his last French
campaign He had been ordered by the Emperor to carry a battery which
was playing heavily on our army after several unsuccessful efforts
the general put himself at the head of a regiment of cuirassiers and
charged the battery intending as was his custom to cut down the men
at their guns He was on horseback just before the mouth of a cannon
where all the artillerymen had been either killed or wounded when one
of them still found strength to raise himself upon one knee and to
apply the lighted match to the touchholeand that when your father was
about ten paces in front of the loaded piece

Oh what a peril for our father

Never he told me had he run such imminent danger for he saw the
artilleryman apply the match and the gun go offbut at the very nick
a man of tall stature dressed as a peasant and whom he had not before
remarked threw himself in front of the cannon

Unfortunate creature what a horrible death

Yes said Dagobert thoughtfully it should have been so He ought by
rights to have been blown into a thousand pieces But nonothing of the
kind

What do you tell us

What the general told me At the moment when the gun went off as he
often repeated to me I shut my eyes by an involuntary movement that
I might not see the mutilated body of the poor wretch who had sacrificed
himself in my place When I again opened them the first thing I saw in
the midst of the smoke was the tall figure of this man standing
erect and calm on the same spot and casting a sad mild look on the
artilleryman who with one knee on the ground and his body thrown
backward gazed on him in as much terror as if he had been the devil
Afterwards I lost sight of this man in the tumult added your father

Bless me Dagobert how can this be possible

That is just what I said to the general He answered me that he had
never been able to explain to himself this event which seemed as
incredible as it was true Moreover your father must have been greatly
struck with the countenance of this man who appeared he said about
thirty years of agefor he remarked that his extremely black eyebrows
were joined together and formed as it were one line from temple to
temple so that he seemed to have a black streak across his forehead
Remember this my children you will soon see why

Oh Dagobert we shall not forget it said the orphans growing more
and more astonished as he proceeded

Is it not strangethis man with a black seam on his forehead

Well you shall hear The general had as I told you been left for
dead at Waterloo During the night which he passed on the field of
battle in a sort of delirium brought on by the fever of his wounds he
saw or fancied he saw this same man bending over him with a look
of great mildness and deep melancholy stanching his wounds and using
every effort to revive him But as your father whose senses were still
wandering repulsed his kindness saying that after such a defeat it
only remained to dieit appeared as if this man replied to him You
must live for Eva meaning your mother whom the general had left at
Warsaw to join the Emperor and make this campaign of France

How strange DagobertAnd since then did our father never see this
man

Yes he saw himfor it was he who brought news of the general to your
poor mother

When was that We never heard of it

You remember that on the day your mother died you went to the pine
forest with old Fedora

Yes answered Rose mournfully to fetch some heath of which our
mother was so fond

Poor mother added Blanche she appeared so well that morning that
we could not dream of the calamity which awaited us before night

True my children I sang and worked that morning in the garden
expecting no more than you did what was to happen Well as I was
singing at my work on a sudden I heard a voice ask me in French
Is this the village of MiloskI turned round and saw before me a
stranger I looked at him attentively and instead of replying fell
back two steps quite stupefied

Ah why

He was of tall stature very pale with a high and open forehead but
his eyebrows met and seemed to form one black streak across it

Then it was the same man who had twice been with our father in battle

Yesit was he

But Dagobert said Rose thoughtfully is it not a long time since
these battles

About sixteen years

And of what age was this stranger

Hardly more than thirty

Then how can it be the same man who sixteen years before had been
with our father in the wars

You are right said Dagobert after a moments silence and shrugging
his shoulders I may have been deceived by a chance likenessand
yet

Or if it were the same he could not have got older all that while

But did you ask him if he had not formerly relieved our father

At first I was so surprised that I did not think of it and afterwards
he remained so short a time that I had no opportunity Well he asked
me for the village of Milosk You are there sir said I but how
do you know that I am a Frenchman I heard you singing as I passed
replied he could you tell me the house of Madame Simon the generals
wife She lives here sir Then looking at me for some seconds in
silence he took me by the hand and said You are the friend of General
Simonhis best friend Judge of my astonishment as I answered But
sir how do you know He has often spoken of you with gratitude You
have seen the general then Yes some time ago in India I am also
his friend I bring news of him to his wife whom I knew to be exiled
in Siberia At Tobolsk whence I come I learned that she inhabits this
village Conduct me to her

The good travellerI love him already said Rose

Yes being fathers friend

I begged him to wait an instant whilst I went to inform your mother
so that the surprise might not do her harm five minutes after he was
beside her

And what kind of man was this traveller Dagobert

He was very tall he wore a dark pelisse and a fur cap and had long
black hair

Was he handsome

Yes my childrenvery handsome but with so mild and melancholy an
air that it pained my heart to see him

Poor man he had doubtless known some great sorrow

Your mother had been closeted with him for some minutes when she
called me to her and said that she had just received good news of the
general She was in tears and had before her a large packet of papers
it was a kind of journal which your father had written every evening to
console himself not being able to speak to her he told the paper all
that he would have told her

Oh where are these papers Dagobert

There in the knapsack with my cross and our purse One day I will
give them to you but I have picked out a few leaves here and there for
you to read presently You will see why

Had our father been long in India

I gathered from the few words which your mother said that the general
had gone to that country after fighting for the Greeks against the
Turksfor he always liked to side with the weak against the strong
In India he made fierce war against the English they had murdered our
prisoners in pontoons and tortured the Emperor at St Helena and the
war was a doubly good one for in harming them he served a just cause

What cause did he serve then

That of one of the poor native princes whose territories the English
lay waste till the day when they can take possession of them against
law and right You see my children it was once more the weak against
the strong and your father did not miss this opportunity In a few
months he had so welltrained and disciplined the twelve or fifteen
thousand men of the prince that in two encounters they cut to pieces
the English sent against them and who no doubt had in their reckoning
left out your brave father my children But come you shall read some
pages of his journal which will tell you more and better than I
can Moreover you will find in them a name which you ought always to
remember thats why I chose this passage

Oh what happiness To read the pages written by our father is almost
to hear him speak said Rose

It is as if he were close beside us added Blanche

And the girls stretched out their hands with eagerness to catch hold
of the leaves that Dagobert had taken from his pocket Then by a
simultaneous movement full of touching grace they pressed the writing
of their father in silence to their lips

You will see also my children at the end of this letter why I
was surprised that your guardian angel as you say should be called
Gabriel Read read added the soldier observing the puzzled air of
the orphans Only I ought to tell you that when he wrote this
the general had not yet fallen in with the traveller who brought the
papers

Rose sitting up in her bed took the leaves and began to read in a
soft and trembling voice Blanche with her head resting on her sisters
shoulder followed attentively every word One could even see by
the slight motion of her lips that she too was reading but only to
herself




CHAPTER VIII EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL SIMONS DIARY

Bivouac on the Mountains of Avers February the 20th 1830

Each time I add some pages to this journal written now in the heart
of India where the fortune of my wandering and proscribed existence has
thrown mea journal which alas my beloved Eva you may never readI
experience a sweet yet painful emotion for although to converse thus
with you is a consolation it brings back the bitter thought that I am
unable to see or speak to you

Still if these pages should ever meet your eyes your generous heart
will throb at the name of the intrepid being to whom I am this day
indebted for my life and to whom I may thus perhaps owe the happiness
of seeing you againyou and my childfor of course our child lives
Yes it must befor else poor wife what an existence would be yours
amid the horrors of exile Dear soul he must now be fourteen Whom
does he resemble Is he like you Has he your large and beautiful blue
eyesMadman that I am how many times in this long daybook have
I already asked the same idle question to which you can return no
answerHow many times shall I continue to ask itBut you will teach
our child to speak and love the somewhat savage name of Djalma

Djalma said Rose as with moist eyes she left off reading

Djalma repeated Blanche who shared the emotion of her sister Oh
we shall never forget that name

And you will do well my children for it seems to be the name of a
famous soldier though a very young one But go on my little Rose

I have told you in the preceding pages my dear Eva of the two
glorious days we had this month The troops of my old friend the
prince which daily make fresh advances in European discipline have
performed wonders We have beaten the English and obliged them to
abandon a portion of this unhappy country which they had invaded in
contempt of all the rights of justice and which they continue to
ravage without mercy for in these parts warfare is another name for
treachery pillage and massacre This morning after a toilsome march
through a rocky and mountainous district we received information from
our scouts that the enemy had been reinforced and was preparing to act
on the offensive and as we were separated from them by a distance of
a few leagues only an engagement became inevitable My old friend
the prince the father of my deliverer was impatient to march to the
attack The action began about three oclock it was very bloody
and furious Seeing that our men wavered for a moment for they were
inferior in number and the English reinforcements consisted of fresh
troops I charged at the head of our weak reserve of cavalry The old
prince was in the centre fighting as he always fights intrepidly his
son Djalma scarcely eighteen as brave as his father did not leave my
side In the hottest part of the engagement my horse was killed under
me and rolling over into a ravine along the edge of which I was
riding I found myself so awkwardly entangled beneath him that for an
instant I thought my thigh was broken

Poor father said Blanche

This time happily nothing more dangerous ensued thanks to Djalma
You see Dagobert added Rose that I remember the name And she
continued to read

The English thoughtand a very flattering opinion it wasthat if
they could kill me they would make short work of the princes army
So a Sepoy officer with five or six irregularscowardly ferocious
plunderersseeing me roll down the ravine threw themselves into it
to despatch me Surrounded by fire and smoke and carried away by their
ardor our mountaineers had not seen me fall but Djalma never left me
He leaped into the ravine to my assistance and his cool intrepidity
saved my life He had held the fire of his doublebarrelled carbine
with one load he killed the officer on the spot with the other he
broke the arm of an irregular who had already pierced my left hand
with his bayonet But do not be alarmed dear Eva it is nothingonly a
scratch

Woundedagain woundedalas cried Blanche clasping her hands
together and interrupting her sister

Take courage said Dagobert I dare say it was only a scratch as
the general calls it Formerly he used to call wounds which did not
disable a man from fighting blank wounds There was no one like him for
such sayings

Djalma seeing me wounded resumed Rose wiping her eyes made use
of his heavy carbine as a club and drove back the soldiers At that
instant I perceived a new assailant who sheltered behind a clump of
bamboos which commanded the ravine slowly lowered his long gun placed
the barrel between two branches and took deliberate aim at Djalma
Before my shouts could apprise him of his danger the brave youth
had received a ball in his breast Feeling himself hit he fell bark
involuntarily two paces and dropped upon one knee but he still
remained firm endeavoring to cover me with his body You may conceive
my rage and despair whilst all my efforts to disengage myself were
paralyzed by the excruciating pain in my thigh Powerless and disarmed
I witnessed for some moments this unequal struggle

Djalma was losing blood rapidly his strength of arm began to fail him
already one of the irregulars inciting his comrades with his voice
drew from his belt a huge heavy kind of billhook when a dozen of
our mountaineers made their appearance borne towards the spot by the
irresistible current of the battle Djalma was rescued in his turn I
was released and in a quarter of an hour I was able to mount a horse
The fortune of the day is ours though with severe loss but the fires
of the English camp are still visible and tomorrow the conflict will
be decisive Thus my beloved Eva I owe my life to this youth Happily
his wound occasions us no uneasiness the ball only glanced along the
ribs in a slanting direction

The brave boy might have said A blank wound like the general
observed Dagobert

Now my dear Eva continued Rose you must become acquainted by
means of this narrative at least with the intrepid Djalma He is but
just eighteen With one word I will paint for you his noble and valiant
nature it is a custom of this country to give surnames and when only
fifteen he was called The Generousby which was of course meant
generous in heart and mind By another custom no less touching than
whimsical this name was reverted to his parent who is called The
Father of the Generous and who might with equal propriety be called
The Just for this old Indian is a rare example of chivalrous honor
and proud independence He might like so many other poor princes of
this country have humbled himself before the execrable despotism of
the English bargained for the relinquishment of sovereign power
and submitted to brute forcebut it was not in his nature My whole
rights or a grave in my native mountainssuch is his motto And this
is no empty boast it springs from the conviction of what is right and
just But you will be crushed in the struggle I have said to himMy
friend he answered what if to force you to a disgraceful act you
were told to yield or dieFrom that day I understood him and have
devoted myself mind and body to the ever sacred cause of the weak
against the strong You see my Eva that Djalma shows himself worthy of
such a father This young Indian is so proud so heroic in his bravery
that like a young Greek of Leonidas age he fights with his breast
bare while other warriors of his country who indeed usually have
arms breast and shoulders uncovered wear in time of battle a thick
impenetrable vest The rash daring of this youth reminds me of Murat
King of Naples who I have so often told you I have seen a hundred
times leading the most desperate charges with nothing but a ridingwhip
in his hand

Thats another of those kings I was telling you of whom the Emperor
set up for his amusement said Dagobert I once saw a Prussian officer
prisoner whose face had been cut across by that madcap King of Naples
ridingwhip the mark was there a black and blue stripe The
Prussian swore he was dishonored and that a sabrecut would have been
preferable I should rather think so That devil of a king he only
had one idea Forward on to the cannon As soon as they began to
cannonade one would have thought the guns were calling him with all
their might for he was soon up to them with his Here I am If I
speak to you about him my children its because he was fond of
repeatingNo one can break through a square of infantry if General
Simon or I cant do it

Rose continued

I have observed with pain that notwithstanding his youth Djalma
is often subject to fits of deep melancholy At times I have seen
him exchange with his father looks of singular import In spite of our
mutual attachment I believe that both conceal from me some sad family
secret in so far as I can judge from expressions which have dropped
from them by chance

It relates to some strange event which their vivid imaginations have
invested with a supernatural character

And yet my love you and I have no longer the right to smile at the
credulity of others I since the French campaign when I met with
that extraordinary adventure which to this day I am quite unable to
understand

This refers to the man who threw himself before the mouth of the
cannon said Dagobert

And you continued the maiden still reading you my dear Eva
since the visits of that young and beautiful woman whom as your mother
asserted she had seen at her mothers house forty years before

The orphans in amazement looked at the soldier

Your mother never spoke to me of that nor the general either my
children this is as strange to me as it is to you

With increasing excitement and curiosity Rose continued

After all my dear Eva things which appear very extraordinary may
often be explained by a chance resemblance or a freak of nature Marvels
being always the result of optical illusion or heated fancy a time must
come when that which appeared to be superhuman or supernatural will
prove to be the most simple and natural event in the world I doubt not
therefore that the things which we denominate our prodigies will one
day receive this commonplace solution

You see my childrenthings appear marvelous which at bottom are
quite simplethough for a long time we understand nothing about them

As our father relates this we must believe it and not be
astonishedeh sister

Yes trulysince it will all be explained one day

For example said Dagobert after a moments reflection you two
are so much alike that any one who was not in the habit of seeing you
daily might easily take one for the other Well if they did not know
that you are so to speakdoubles they might think an imp was at work
instead of such good little angels as you are

You are right Dagobert in this way many things may be explained even
as our father says And Rose continued to read

Not without pride my gentle Eva have I learned that Djalma has French
blood in his veins His father married some years ago a young girl
whose family of French origin had long been settled at Batavia in the
island of Java This similarity of circumstances between my old friend
and myselffor your family also my Eva is of French origin and long
settled in a foreign landhas only served to augment my sympathy for
him Unfortunately he has long had to mourn the loss of the wife whom
he adored

See my beloved Eva my hand trembles as I write these words I am
weakI am foolishbut alas my heart sinks within me If such a
misfortune were to happen to meOh my Godwhat would become of our
child without theewithout his fatherin that barbarous country
But no the very fear is madness and yet what a horrible torture is
uncertainty Where may you now be What are you doing What has become
of you Pardon these black thoughts which are sometimes too much for
me They are the cause of my worst momentsfor when free from them
I can at least say to myself I am proscribed I am every way
unfortunatebut at the other end of the world two hearts still beat
for me with affectionyours my Eva and our childs

Rose could hardly finish this passage for some seconds her voice was
broken by sobs There was indeed a fatal coincidence between the fears
of General Simon and the sad reality and what could be more touching
than these outpourings of the heart written by the light of a watch
fire on the eve of battle by a soldier who thus sought to soothe the
pangs of a separation which he felt bitterly but knew not would be
eternal

Poor general he is unaware of our misfortune said Dagobert after
a moments silence but neither has he heard that he has two children
instead of one That will be at least some consolation But come
Blanche do go on reading I fear that this dwelling on grief fatigues
your sister and she is too much affected by it Besides after all it
is only just that you should take your share of its pleasure and its
sorrow

Blanche took the letter and Rose having dried her eyes laid in her
turn her sweet head on the shoulder of her sister who thus continued

I am calmer now my dear Eva I left off writing for a moment
and strove to banish those black presentiments Let us resume our
conversation After discoursing so long about India I will talk to
you a little of Europe Yesterday evening one of our people a trusty
fellow rejoined our outposts He brought me a letter which had arrived
from France at Calcutta at length I have news of my father and am no
longer anxious on his account This letter is dated in August of last
year I see by its contents that several other letters to which he
alludes have either been delayed or lost for I had not received
any for two years before and was extremely uneasy about him But my
excellent father is the same as ever Age has not weakened him his
character is as energetic his health as robust as in times paststill
a workman still proud of his order still faithful to his austere
republican ideas still hoping much

For he says to me the time is at hand and he underlines those
words He gives me also as you will see good news of the family of old
Dagobert our friendfor in truth my dear Eva it soothes my grief
to think that this excellent man is with you that he will have
accompanied you in your exilefor I know hima kernel of gold beneath
the rude rind of a soldier How he must love our child

Here Dagobert coughed two or three times stooped down and appeared
to be seeking on the ground the little red and blue checkhandkerchief
spread over his knees He remained thus bent for some seconds and when
he raised himself he drew his hand across his moustache

How well father knows you

How rightly has he guessed that you would love us

Well well children pass over thatLets come to the part where the
general speaks of my little Agricola and of Gabriel my wifes adopted
child Poor woman when I think that in three months perhapsbut
come child read read added the old soldier wishing to conceal his
emotion

I still hope against hope my dear Eva that these pages will one
day reach you and therefore I wish to insert in them all that can be
interesting to Dagobert It will be a consolation to him to have some
news of his family My father who is still foreman at Mr Hardys
tells me that worthy man has also taken into his house the son of old
Dagobert Agricola works under my father who is enchanted with him
He is he tells me a tall and vigorous lad who wields the heavy
forge hammer as if it were a feather and is lightspirited as he is
intelligent and laborious He is the best workman on the establishment
and this does not prevent him in the evening after his hard days work
when he returns home to his mother whom he truly loves from making
songs and writing excellent patriotic verses His poetry is full of fire
and energy his fellowworkmen sing nothing else and his lays have the
power to warm the coldest and the most timid hearts

How proud you must be of your son Dagobert said Rose in admiration
he writes songs

Certainly it is all very finebut what pleases me best is that he is
good to his mother and that he handles the hammer with a will As
for the songs before he makes a Rising of the People or a
Marseillaise he will have had to beat a good deal of iron but where
can this rascally sweet Agricola have learned to make songs at allNo
doubt it was at school where he went as you will see with his
adopted brother Gabriel

At this name of Gabriel which reminded them of the imaginary being whom
they called their guardian angel the curiosity of the young girls was
greatly excited With redoubled attention Blanche continued in these
words

The adopted brother of Agricola the poor deserted child whom the wife
of our good Dagobert so generously took in forms my father tells me a
great contrast with Agricola not in heart for they have both excellent
hearts but Gabriel is as thoughtful and melancholy as Agricola is
lively joyous and active Moreover adds my father each of them so
to speak has the aspect which belongs to his character Agricola
is dark tall and strong with a gay and bold air Gabriel on
the contrary is weak fair timid as a girl and his face wears an
expression of angelic mildness

The orphans looked at each other in surprise then as they turned
towards the soldier their ingenuous countenances Rose said to him
Have you heard Dagobert Father says that your Gabriel is fair and
has the face of an angel Why tis exactly like ours

Yes yes I heard very well it is that which surprised me in your
dream

I should like to know if he has also blue eyes said Rose

As for that my children though the general says nothing about it I
will answer for it your fair boys have always blue eyes But blue or
black he will not use them to stare at young ladies go on and you
will see why

Blanche resumed

His face wears an expression of angelic mildness One of the Brothers
of the Christian Schools where he went with Agricola and other children
of his quarter struck with his intelligence and good disposition spoke
of him to a person of consequence who becoming interested in the lad
placed him in a seminary for the clergy and since the last two years
Gabriel is a priest He intends devoting himself to foreign missions
and will soon set out for America

Your Gabriel is a priest it appears said Rose looking at Dagobert

While ours is an angel added Blanche

Which only proves that yours is a step higher than mine Well every
one to his taste there are good people in all trades but I prefer that
it should be Gabriel who has chosen the black gown Id rather see my
boy with arms bare hammer in hand and a leathern apron round him
neither more nor less than your old grandfather my childrenthe father
of Marshal Simon Duke of Lignyfor after all marshal and duke he is
by the grace of the Emperor Now finish your letter

Soon alas yes said Blanche there are only a few lines left And
she proceeded

Thus my dear loving Eva if this journal should ever reach its
destination you will be able to satisfy Dagobert as to the position of
his wife and son whom he left for our sakes How can we ever repay such
a sacrifice But I feel sure that your good and generous heart will
have found some means of compensation

AdieuAgain adieu for today my beloved Eva I left off writing
for a moment to visit the tent of Djalma He slept peacefully and
his father watched beside him with a smile he banished my fears This
intrepid young man is no longer in any danger May he still be spared in
the combat of tomorrow Adieu my gentle Eva the night is silent
and calm the fires of the bivouac are slowly dying out and our poor
mountaineers repose after this bloody day I can hear from hour to
hour the distant alls well of our sentinels Those foreign words
bring back my grief they remind me of what I sometimes forget in
writingthat I am faraway separated from you and from my child Poor
beloved beings what will be your destiny Ah if I could only send you
in time that medal which by a fatal accident I carried away with
me from Warsaw you might perhaps obtain leave to visit France or
at least to send our child there with Dagobert for you know of what
importanceBut why add this sorrow to all the rest Unfortunately the
years are passing away the fatal day will arrive and this last hope
in which I live for you will also be taken from me but I will not
close the evening by so sad a thought Adieu my beloved Eva Clasp our
child to your bosom and cover it with all the kisses which I send to
both of you from the depths of exile

Till tomorrowafter the battle

The reading of this touching letter was followed by long silence The
tears of Rose and Blanche flowed together Dagobert with his head
resting on his hand was absorbed in painful reflections

Without doors the wind had now augmented in violence a heavy rain
began to beat on the sounding panes the most profound silence reigned
in the interior of the inn But whilst the daughters of General Simon
were reading with such deep emotion these fragments of their fathers
journal a strange and mysterious scene transpired in the menagerie of
the brutetamer




CHAPTER IX THE CAGES

Morok had prepared himself Over his deerskin vest he had drawn
the coat of mailthat steel tissue as pliable as cloth as hard as
diamonds next clothing his arms and legs in their proper armor
and his feet in ironbound buskins and concealing all this defensive
equipment under loose trousers and an ample pelisse carefully buttoned
he took in his hand a long bar of iron whitehot set in a wooden
handle

Though long ago daunted by the skill and energy of the Prophet his
tiger Cain his lion Judas and his black panther Death had sometimes
attempted in a moment of rebellion to try their fangs and claws on
his person but thanks to the armor concealed beneath his pelisse they
blunted their claws upon a skin of steel and notched their fangs upon
arms or legs of iron whilst a slight touch of their masters metallic
wand left a deep furrow in their smoking shrivelled flesh

Finding the inutility of their efforts and endowed with strong memory
the beasts soon learned that their teeth and claws were powerless
when directed against this invulnerable being Hence their terrified
submission reached to such a point that in his public representations
their master could make them crouch and cower at his feet by the least
movement of a little wand covered with flamecolored paper

The Prophet thus armed with care and holding in his hand the iron made
hot by Goliath descended by the trapdoor of the loft into the large
shed beneath in which were deposited the cages of his animals A mere
wooden partition separated this shed from the stable that contained his
horses

A lantern with a reflector threw a vivid light on the cages They were
four in number A wide iron grating formed their sides turning at one
end upon hinges like a door so as to give ingress to the animal the
bottom of each den rested on two axletrees and four small iron castors
so that they could easily be removed to the large covered wagon in which
they were placed during a journey One of them was empty the other
three contained as already intimated a panther a tiger and a lion

The panther originally from Java seemed to merit the gloomy name
of Death by her grim ferocious aspect Completely black she lay
crouching and rolled up in the bottom of her cage and her dark hues
mingling with the obscurity which surrounded her nothing was distinctly
visible but fixed and glaring eyesyellow balls of phosphoric light
which only kindled as it were in the nighttime for it is the nature
of all the animals of the feline species to enjoy entire clearness of
vision but in darkness

The Prophet entered the stable in silence the dark red of his long
pelisse contrasted with the pale yellow of his straight hair and beard
the lantern placed at some height above the ground threw its rays full
upon this man and the strong light opposed to the deep shadows around
it gave effect to the sharp proportions of his bony and savage looking
figure

He approached the cage slowly The white rim which encircled his
eyeball appeared to dilate and his look rivaled in motionless
brilliancy the steadily sparkling gaze of the panther Still crouching
in the shade she felt already the fascination of that glance two
or three times she dropped her eyelids with a low angry howl then
reopening her eyes as if in spite of herself she kept them fastened
immovably on those of the Prophet And now her rounded ears clung to
her skull which was flattened like a vipers the skin of her forehead
became convulsively wrinkled she drew in her bristling but silky
muzzle and twice silently opened her jaws garnished with formidable
fangs From that moment a kind of magnetic connection seemed to be
established between the man and the beast

The Prophet extended his glowing bar towards the cage and said in a
sharp imperious tone Death come here

The panther rose but so dragged herself along that her belly and the
bend of her legs touched the ground She was three feet high and nearly
five in length her elastic and fleshy spine the sinews of her thighs
as well developed as those of a racehorse her deep chest her enormous
jutting shoulders the nerve and muscle in her short thick pawsall
announced that this terrible animal united vigor with suppleness and
strength with agility

Morok with his iron wand still extended in the direction of the cage
made a step towards the panther The panther made a stride towards the
Prophet Morok stopped Death stopped also

At this moment the tiger Judas to whom Moroks back was turned
bounded violently in his cage as if jealous of the attention which his
master paid to the panther He growled hoarsely and raising his head
showed the underpart of his redoubtable triangular jaw and his broad
chest of a dirty white with which blended the copper color streaked
with black of his sides his tail like a huge red serpent with rings
of ebony now clung to his flanks now lashed them with a slow and
continuous movement his eyes of a transparent brilliant green were
fixed upon the Prophet

Such was the influence of this man over his animals that Judas almost
immediately ceased growling as if frightened at his own temerity but
his respiration continued loud and deep Morok turned his face towards
him and examined him very attentively during some seconds The panther
no longer subject to the influence of her masters look slunk back to
crouch in the shade

A sharp cracking in sudden breaks like that which great animals make
in gnawing hard substances was now heard from the cage of the lion
It drew the attention of the Prophet who leaving the tiger advanced
towards the other den

Nothing could be seen of the lion but his monstrous croup of a reddish
yellow His thighs were gathered under him and his thick mane served
entirely to conceal his head But by the tension and movement of the
muscles of his loins and the curving of his backbone it was easy to
perceive that he was making violent efforts with his throat and his
forepaws The Prophet approached the cage with same uneasiness fearing
that notwithstanding his orders Goliath had given the lion some bones
to gnaw To assure himself of it he said in a quick and firm voice
Cain

The lion did not change his position

Cain come here repeated Morok in a louder tone The appeal was
useless the lion did not move and the noise continued

Cain come here said the Prophet a third time but as he pronounced
these words he applied the end of the glowing bar to the haunch of the
lion

Scarcely did the light track of smoke appear on the reddish hide of
Cain when with a spring of incredible agility he turned and
threw himself against the grating not crouching but at a single
boundupright superb terrifying The Prophet being at the angle of
the cage Cain in his fury had raised himself sideways to face his
master and leaning his huge flank against the bars thrust between
them his enormous fore leg which with his swollen muscles was as
large as Goliaths thigh

Cain down said the Prophet approaching briskly

The lion did not obey immediately His lips curling with rage
displayed fangs as long as large and as pointed as the tusks of a wild
boar But Morok touched those lips with the end of the burning metal
and as he felt the smart followed by an unexpected summons of his
master the lion not daring to roar uttered a hollow growl and his
great body sank down at once in an attitude of submission and fear

The Prophet took down the lantern to see what Cain had been gnawing It
was one of the planks from the floor of his den which he had succeeded
in tearing up and was crunching between his teeth in the extremity of
his hunger For a few moments the most profound silence reigned in the
menagerie The Prophet with his hands behind his back went from one
cage to the other observing the animals with a restless contemplative
look as if he hesitated to make between them an important and difficult
choice

From time to time he listened at the great door of the shed which
opened on the courtyard of the inn At length this door turned on its
hinges and Goliath appeared his clothes dripping with water

Well is it done said the Prophet

Not without trouble Luckily the night is dark it blows hard and it
pours with rain

Then there is no suspicion

None master Your information was good The door of the cellar opens
on the fields just under the window of the lasses When you whistled to
let me know it was time I crept out with a stool I had provided I put
it up against the wall and mounted upon it with my six feet that made
nine and I could lean my elbows on the windowledge I took the shutter
in one hand and the haft of my knife in the other and whilst I broke
two of the panes I pushed the shutter with all my might

And they thought it was the wind

Yes they thought it was the wind You see the brute is not such a
brute after all That done I crept back into my cellar carrying my
stool with me In a little time I heard the voice of the old man it
was well I had made haste

Yes when I whistled to you he had just entered the supperroom I
thought he would have been longer

That mans not built to remain long at supper said the giant
contemptuously Some moments after the panes had been broken the old
man opened the window and called his dog saying Jump outI went
and hid myself at the further end of the cellar or that infernal dog
would have scented me through the door

The dog is now shut up in the stable with the old mans horse

Go on

When I heard them close shutter and window I came out of my cellar
replaced my stool and again mounted upon it Unfastening the shutter
I opened it without noise but the two broken panes were stopped up with
the skirts of a pelisse I heard talking but I could see nothing so I
moved the pelisse a little and then I could see the two lasses in bed
opposite to me and the old man sitting down with his back to where I
stood

But the knapsackthe knapsackThat is the most important

The knapsack was near the window on a table by the side of a lamp I
could have reached it by stretching out my arm

What did you hear said

As you told me to think only of the knapsack I can only remember what
concerns the knapsack The old man said he had some papers in itthe
letter of a generalhis moneyhis cross

Goodwhat next

As it was difficult for me to keep the pelisse away from the hole it
slipped through my fingers In trying to get hold of it again I put
my hand too much forward One of the lasses saw it and screamed out
pointing to the window

Dolt exclaimed the Prophet becoming pale with rage you have ruined
all

Stop a bit there is nothing broken yet When I heard the scream I
jumped down from my stool and got back into the cellar as the dog was
no longer about I left the door ajar so that I could hear them open
the window and see by the light that the old man was looking out with
the lamp but he could find no ladder and the window was too high for
any man of common size to reach it

He will have thought like the first time that it was the wind You
are less awkward than I imagined

The wolf has become a fox as you said Knowing where the knapsack was
to be found with the money and the papers and not being able to do more
for the moment I came awayand here I am

Go upstairs and fetch me the longest pike

Yes master

And the red blanket

Yes master

Go

Goliath began to mount the ladder halfway up he stopped Master
said he may I not bring down a bit of meat for Deathyou will see
that shell bear me malice she puts it all down to my account she
never forgets and on the first occasion

The pike and the cloth repeated the Prophet in an imperious tone
And whilst Goliath swearing to himself proceeded to execute his
instructions Morok opened the great door of the shed looked out into
the yard and listened

Heres the pike and the cloth said the giant as he descended the
ladder with the articles Now what must I do next

Return to the cellar mount once more by the window and when the old
man leaves the room

Who will make him leave the room

Never mind he will leave it

What next

You say the lamp is near the window

Quite nearon the table next to the knapsack

Well then as soon as the old man leaves the room push open the
window throw down the lamp and if you accomplish cleverly what remains
to dothe ten florins are yoursyou remember it all

Yes yes

The girls will be so frightened by the noise and darkness that they
will remain dumb with terror

Make yourself easy The wolf turned into a fox why not a serpent

There is yet something

Well what now

The roof of this shed is not very high the window of the loft is easy
of access the night is darkinstead of returning by the door

I will come in at the window

Ay and without noise

Like a regular snake and the giant departed

Yes said the Prophet to himself after a long silence these means
are sure It was not for me to hesitate A blind and obscure instrument
I know not the motives of the orders I have received but from the
recommendations which accompany thembut from the position of him who
sends themimmense interests must be involvedinterests connected with
all that is highest and greatest upon earthAnd yet how can these
two girls almost beggars how can this wretched soldier represent such
interestsNo matter added he with humility I am the arm which
actsit is for the head which thinks and orders to answer for its
work

Soon after the Prophet left the shed carrying with him the red cloth
and directed his steps towards the little stable that contained Jovial
The crazy door imperfectly secured by a latch was easily opened At
sight of a stranger Spoilsport threw himself upon him but his teeth
encountered the iron leggings of the Prophet who in spite of the
efforts of the dog took Jovial by his halter threw the blanket over
his head to prevent his either seeing or smelling and led him from the
stable into the interior of the menagerie of which he closed the door




CHAPTER X THE SURPRISE

The orphans after reading the journal of their father remained for
some moments silent sad and pensive contemplating the leaves yellowed
by time Dagobert also plunged in a reverie thought of his wife and
son from whom he had been so long separated and hoped soon to see
again

The soldier was the first to break the silence which had lasted for
several minutes Taking the leaves from the hand of Blanche he folded
them carefully put them into his pocket and thus addressed the
orphans

Courage my children you see what a brave father you have Think only
of the pleasure of greeting him and remember always the name of the
gallant youth to whom you will owe that pleasurefor without him your
father would have been killed in India

Djalma we shall never forget him said Rose

And if our guardian angel Gabriel should return added Blanche we
will ask him to watch over Djalma as over ourselves

Very well my children I am sure that you will forget nothing that
concerns good feeling But to return to the traveller who came to visit
your poor mother in Siberia he had seen the general a month after the
events of which you have read and at a moment when he was about to
enter on a new campaign against the English It was then that your
father entrusted him with the papers and medal

But of what use will this medal be to us Dagobert

And what is the meaning of these words engraved upon it added Rose
as she drew it from her bosom

Why it means my children that on the 13th of February 1832 we must
be at No 3 Rue Saint Francois Paris

But what are we to do there

Your poor mother was seized so quickly with her last illness that she
was unable to tell me All I know is that this medal came to her from
her parents and that it had been a relic preserved in her family for
more than a century

And how did our father get it

Among the articles which had been hastily thrown into the coach
when he was removed by force from Warsaw was a dressingcase of your
mothers in which was contained this medal Since that time the general
had been unable to send it back having no means of communicating with
us and not even knowing where we were

This medal is then of great importance to us

Unquestionably for never during fifteen years had I seen your mother
so happy as on the day the traveller brought it back to her Now
said she to me in the presence of the stranger and with tears of joy
in her eyes now may my childrens future be brilliant as their life
has hitherto been miserable I will entreat of the governor of Siberia
permission to go to France with my daughters it will perhaps be thought
I have been sufficiently punished by fifteen years of exile and the
confiscation of my property Should they refuse I will remain here but
they will at least allow me to send my children to France and you must
accompany them Dagobert You shall set out immediately for much time
has been already lost and if you were not to arrive before the 13th
of next February this cruel separation and toilsome journey would have
been all in vain

Suppose we were one day after

Your mother told me that if we arrived the 14th instead of the 13th it
would be too late She also gave me a thick letter to put into the
post for France in the first town we should pass throughwhich I have
done

And do you think we shall be at Paris in time

I hope so still if you are strong enough we must sometimes make
forced marchesfor if we only travel our five leagues a day and that
without accident we shall scarcely reach Paris until the beginning of
February and it is better to be a little beforehand

But as father is inIndia and condemned to death if he return to
France when shall we see him

And where shall we see him

Poor children there are so many things you have yet to learn When the
traveller quitted him the general could not return to France but now
he can do so

And why is that

Because the Bourbons who had banished him were themselves turned out
last year The news must reach India and your father will certainly
come to meet you at Paris because he expects that you and your mother
will be there on the 13th of next February

Ah now I understand how we may hope to see him said Rose with a
sigh

Do you know the name of this traveller Dagobert

No my children but whether called Jack or John he is a good sort
When he left your mother she thanked him with tears for all his
kindness and devotion to the general herself and the children but he
pressed her hands in his and said to her in so gentle a voice that
I could not help being touched by it Why do you thank me Did He not
SayLOVE YE ONE ANOTHER

Who is that Dagobert

Yes of whom did the traveller speak

I know nothing about it only the manner in which he pronounced those
words struck me and they were the last he spoke

Love one another repeated Rose thoughtfully

How beautiful are those words added Blanche

And whither was the traveller going

Far very far into the North as he told your mother When she saw
him depart she said to me His mild sad talk has affected me even to
tears whilst I listened to him I seemed to be growing betterI
seemed to love my husband and my children moreand yet to judge by the
expression of his countenance one would think that this stranger had
never either smiled or wept She and I watched him from the door as
long as we could follow him with our eyes he carried his head down and
his walk was slow calm and firm one might fancy that he counted his
steps And talking of steps I remarked yet another thing

What was it Dagobert

You know that the road which led to our house way always damp because
of the overflowing of the little spring

Yes

Well then the mark of the travellers footsteps remained in the clay
and I saw that he had nails under his shoe in the form of a cross

How in the form of a cross

Look said Dagobert placing the tip of his finger seven times on the
coverlet of the bed they were arrange thus beneath his heel

 
   
 
 
 

You see it forms a cross

What could it mean Dagobert

Chance perhapsyes chanceand yet in spite of myself this
confounded cross left behind him struck me as a bad omen for hardly was
he gone when misfortune after misfortune fell upon us

Alas the death of our mother

Yesbut before that another piece of illluck You had not yet
returned and she was writing her petition to ask leave to go to France
or to send you there when I heard the gallop of a horse It was a
courier from the governor general of Siberia He brought us orders to
change our residence within three days we were to join other condemned
persons and be removed with them four hundred leagues further north
Thus after fifteen years of exile they redoubled in cruelty towards
your mother

Why did they thus torment her

One would think that some evil genius was at work against her A few
days later the traveller would no longer have found us at Milosk and
if he had joined us further on it would have been too far for the medal
and papers to be of usesince having set out almost immediately we
shall hardly arrive in time at Paris If they had some interest to
prevent me and my children from going to France said your mother
they would act just as they have done To banish us four hundred
leagues further is to render impossible this journey of which the term
is fixed And the idea overwhelmed her with grief

Perhaps it was this unexpected sorrow that was the cause of her sudden
illness

Alas no my children it was that infernal cholera who arrives
without giving you noticefor he too is a great travellerand strikes
you down like a thunderbolt Three hours after the traveller had left
us when you returned quite pleased and gay from the forest with your
large bunches of wildflowers for your mother she was already in the
last agony and hardly to be recognized The cholera had broken out in
the village and that evening five persons died of it Your mother had
only time to hang the medal about your neck my dear little Rose
to recommend you both to my care and to beg that we should set out
immediately When she was gone the new order of exile could not apply
to you and I obtained permission from the governor to take my departure
with you for France according to the last wishes

The soldier could not finish the sentence he covered his eyes with his
hand whilst the orphans embraced him sobbing

Oh but resumed Dagobert with pride after a moment of painful
silence it was then that you showed yourselves the brave daughters of
the general Notwithstanding the danger it was impossible to tear
you from your mothers bedside you remained with her to the last you
closed her eyes you watched there all night and you would not leave
the village till you had seen me plant the little wooden cross over the
grave I had dug for her

Dagobert paused abruptly A strange wild neighing mingled with
ferocious roarings made the soldier start from his seat He grew pale
and cried It is Jovial my horse What are they doing to my horse
With that opening the door he rushed down the stairs precipitately

The two sisters clung together so terrified at the sudden departure of
the soldier that they saw not an enormous hand pass through the broken
panes unfasten the catch of the window push it violently open
and throw down the lamp placed on the little table on which was the
soldierss knapsack The orphans thus found themselves plunged into
complete darkness




CHAPTER XI JOVIAL and DEATH

Morok had led Jovial into the middle of the menagerie and then removed
the cloth which prevented him from seeing and smelling Scarcely had
the tiger lion and panther caught a glimpse of him than they threw
themselves half famished against the bars of their dens

The horse struck with stupor his neck stretched out his eye fixed and
trembling through all his limbs appeared as if nailed to the ground
an abundant icy sweat rolled suddenly down his flanks The lion and the
tiger uttered fearful roarings and struggled violently in their dens
The panther did not roar but her mute rage was terrific

With a tremendous bound at the risk of breaking her skull she sprang
from the back of the cage against the bars then still mute still
furious she crawled back to the extreme corner of the den and with a
new spring as impetuous as it was blind she again strove to force
out the iron grating Three times had she thus boundedsilent
appallingwhen the horse passing from the immobility of stupor to the
wild agony of fear neighed long and loud and rushed in desperation at
the door by which he had entered Finding it closed he hung his head
bent his knees a little and rubbed his nostrils against the opening
left between the ground and the bottom of the door as if he wished
to inhale the air from the outside then more and more affrighted he
began to neigh with redoubled force and struck out violently with his
forefeet

At the moment when Death was about once more to make her spring the
Prophet approached her cage The heavy bolt which secured the grating
was pushed from its staple by the pike of the brutetamer and in
another second Morok was half way up the ladder that communicated with
the loft

The roaring of the lion and tiger mingled with the neighing of Jovial
now resounded through all parts of the inn The panther had again
thrown herself furiously on the grating and this time yielding with one
spring she was in the middle of the shed

The light of the lantern was reflected from the glossy ebon of her
hide spotted with stains of a duller black For an instant she remained
motionless crouching upon her thickset limbs with her head close to
the floor as if calculating the distance of the leap by which she was
to reach the horse then suddenly she darted upon him

On seeing her break from her cage Jovial had thrown himself violently
against the door which was made to open inwards and leaned against
it with all his might as though he would force it down Then at
the moment when Death took her leap he reared up in almost an erect
position but she rapid as lightning had fastened upon his throat and
hung there whilst at the same time she buried the sharp claws of her
forefeet in his chest The jugular vein of the horse opened a torrent
of bright red blood spouted forth beneath the tooth of the panther who
now supporting herself on her hind legs squeezed her victim up against
the door whilst she dug into his flank with her claws and laid bare
the palpitating flesh Then his halfstrangled neighing became awful

Suddenly these words resounded Courage JovialI am at hand
Courage

It was the voice of Dagobert who was exhausting himself in desperate
exertions to force open the door that concealed this sanguinary
struggle Jovial cried the soldier I am here Help Help

At the sound of that friendly and wellknown voice the poor animal
almost at its last gasp strove to turn its head in the direction whence
came the accents of his master answered him with a plaintive neigh
and sinking beneath the efforts of the panther fell prostrate first
on its knees then upon its flank so that its backbone lay right
across the door and still prevented its being opened And now all was
finished The panther squatting down upon the horse crushed him with
all her paws and in spite of some last faint kicks buried her bloody
snout in his body

Help help my horse cried Dagobert as he vainly shook the door
And no arms he added with rage no arms

Take care exclaimed the brutetamer who appeared at the window
of the loft do not attempt to enter it might cost you your life My
panther is furious

But my horse my horse cried Dagobert in a voice of agony

He must have strayed from his stable during the night and pushed open
the door of the shed At sight of him the panther must have broken out
of her cage and seized him You are answerable for all the mischief that
may ensue added the brutetamer with a menacing air for I shall
have to run the greatest danger to make Death return to her den

But my horse only save my horse cried Dagobert in a tone of
hopeless supplication

The Prophet disappeared from the window

The roaring of the animals and the shouts of Dagobert had roused from
sleep every one in the White Falcon Here and there lights were seen
moving and windows were thrown open hurriedly The servants of the
inn soon appeared in the yard with lanterns and surrounding Dagobert
inquired of him what had happened

My horse is there cried the soldier continuing to shake the door
and one of that scoundrels animals has escaped from its cage

At these words the people of the inn already terrified by the frightful
roaring fled from the spot and ran to inform the host The soldiers
anguish may be conceived as pale breathless with his ear close to
the chink of the door he stood listening By degrees the roaring had
ceased and nothing was heard but low growls accompanied by the stern
voice of the Prophet repeating in harsh abrupt accents Death come
here Death

The night was profoundly dark and Dagobert did not perceive Goliath
who crawling carefully along the tiled roof entered the loft by the
attic window

And now the gate of the courtyard was again opened and the landlord of
the inn appeared followed by a number of men Armed with a carbine he
advanced with precaution his people carried staves and pitchforks

What is the row here said he as he approached Dagobert What a
hubbub in my house The devil take wild beast showmen and negligent
fellows who dont know how to tie a horse to the manger If your beast
is hurt so much the worse for you you should have taken more care of
it

Instead of replying to these reproaches the soldier who still listened
attentively to what was going on in the shed made a sign to entreat
silence Suddenly a ferocious roar was heard followed by a loud scream
from the Prophet and almost immediately after the panther howled
piteously

You are no doubt the cause of some great accident said the frightened
host to the soldier did you not hear that cry Morok is perhaps
dangerously wounded

Dagobert was about to answer when the door opened and Goliath appeared
on the threshold

You may enter now said he the danger is over

The interior of the menagerie presented a singular spectacle The
Prophet pale and scarcely able to conceal his agitation beneath an
apparent air of calmness was kneeling some paces from the cage of the
panther in the attitude of one absorbed in himself the motion of his
lips indicating that he was praying At sight of the host and the people
of the inn he rose and said in a solemn voice I thank thee my
Preserver that I have been able to conquer by the strength which Thou
hast given me

Then folding his arms with haughty brow and imperious glance he seemed
to enjoy the triumph he had achieved over Death who stretched on the
bottom of her den continued to utter plaintive howlings The spectators
of this scene ignorant that the pelisse of the brutetamer covered a
complete suit of armor and attributing the cries of the panther solely
to fear were struck with astonishment and admiration at the intrepidity
and almost supernatural power of this man A few steps behind him stood
Goliath leaning upon the ashen pikestaff Finally not far from the
cage in the midst of a pool of blood lay the dead body of Jovial

At sight of the bloodstained and torn remains Dagobert stood
motionless and his rough countenance assumed an expression of the
deepest grief then throwing himself on his knees he lifted the head
of Jovial and when he saw those dull glassy and halfclosed eyes
once so bright and intelligent as they turned towards a muchloved
master the soldier could not suppress an exclamation of bitter anguish
Forgetting his anger forgetting the deplorable consequences of this
accident so fatal to the interests of the two maidens who would thus
be prevented from continuing their journeyhe thought only of the
horrible death of his poor old horse the ancient companion of his
fatigues and wars the faithful animal twice wounded like himself and
from whom for so many years he had never been separated This poignant
emotion was so cruelly so affectingly visible in the soldiers
countenance that the landlord and his people felt themselves for a
moment touched with pity as they gazed on the tall veteran kneeling
beside his dead horse

But when following the course of his regrets he thought how Jovial had
also been the companion of his exile how the mother of the orphans had
formerly like her daughters undertaken a toilsome journey with the aid
of this unfortunate animal the fatal consequences of his loss presented
themselves on a sudden to his mind Then fury succeeding to grief
he rose with anger flashing from his eyes and threw himself on the
Prophet with one hand he seized him by the throat and with the other
administered five or six heavy blows which fell harmlessly on the coat
of mail

Rascal you shall answer to me for my horses death said the soldier
as he continued his correction Morok light and sinewy could not
struggle with advantage against Dagobert who aided by his tall
stature still displayed extraordinary vigor It needed the intervention
of Goliath and the landlord to rescue the Prophet from the hands of the
old grenadier After some moments they succeeded in separating the two
champions Morok was white with rage It needed new efforts to prevent
his seizing the pike to attack Dagobert

It is abominable cried the host addressing the soldier who pressed
his clinched fists in despair against his bald forehead You expose
this good man to be devoured by his beasts and then you wish to beat
him into the bargain Is this fitting conduct for a graybeard Shall
we have to fetch the police You showed yourself more reasonable in the
early part of the evening

These words recalled the soldier to himself He regretted his
impetuosity the more as the fact of his being a stranger might augment
the difficulty of his position It was necessary above all to obtain
the price of his horse so as to be enabled to continue his journey the
success of which might be compromised by a single days delay With a
violent effort therefore he succeeded in restraining his wrath

You are rightI was too hasty said he to the host in an agitated
voice which he tried to make as calm as possible I had not the same
patience as before But ought not this man be responsible for the loss
of my horse I make you judge in the matter

Well then as judge I am not of your opinion All this has been your
own fault You tied up your horse badly and he strayed by chance into
this shed of which no doubt the door was halfopen said the host
evidently taking the part of the brutetamer

It was just as you say answered Goliath I can remember it I left
the door ajar that the beasts might have some air in the night The
cages were well shut and there was no danger

Very true said one of the standersby

It was only the sight of the horse added another that made the
panther furious so as to break out of its cage

It is the Prophet who has the most right to complain observed a
third

No matter what this or that person says returned Dagobert whose
patience was beginning to fail him I say that I must have either
money or a horse on the instantyes on the instantfor I wish to quit
this unlucky house

And I say it is you that must indemnify me cried Morok who had kept
this stagetrick for the last and who now exhibited his left hand all
bloody having hitherto concealed it beneath the sleeve of his pelisse
I shall perhaps be disabled for life he added see what a wound the
panther has made here

Without having the serious character that the Prophet ascribed to it
the wound was a pretty deep one This last argument gained for him the
general sympathy Reckoning no doubt upon this incident to secure the
winning of a cause that he now regarded as his own the host said to the
hostler There is only one way to make a finish It is to call up the
burgomaster and beg him to step here He will decide who is right or
wrong

I was just going to propose it to you said the soldier for after
all I cannot take the law into my own hands

Fritz run to the burgomastersand the hustler started in all
haste His master fearing to be compromised by the examination of the
soldier whose papers he had neglected to ask for on his arrival said
to him The burgomaster will be in a very bad humor to be disturbed so
late I have no wish to suffer by it and I must therefore beg you to
go and fetch me your papers to see if they are in rule I ought to have
made you show them when you arrived here in the evening

They are upstairs in my knapsack you shall have them answered the
soldierand turning away his head and putting his hand before his
eyes as he passed the dead body of Jovial he went out to rejoin the
sisters

The Prophet followed him with a glance of triumph and said to himself
There he goeswithout horse without money without papers I could
not do morefor I was forbidden to do moreI was to act with as much
cunning as possible and preserve appearances Now every one will think
this soldier in the wrong I can at least answer for it that he will
not continue his journey for some dayssince such great interests
appear to depend on his arrest and that of the young girls

A quarter of an hour after this reflection of the brutetamer Karl
Goliaths comrade left the hidingplace where his master had concealed
him during the evening and set out for Leipsic with a letter which
Morok had written in haste and which Karl on his arrival was to put
immediately into the post

The address of this letter was as follows

A Monsieur Rodin Rue du MilieudesUrsins No 11 A Paris France




CHAPTER XII THE BURGOMASTER

Dagoberts anxiety increased every moment Certain that his horse had
not entered the shed of its own accord he attributed the event which
had taken place to the spite of the brutetamer but he sought in vain
for the motive of this wretchs animosity and he reflected with dismay
that his cause however just would depend on the good or bad humor of
a judge dragged from his slumbers and who might be ready to condemn upon
fallacious appearances

Fully determined to conceal as long as possible from the orphans the
fresh misfortunes which had befallen them he was proceeding to open
the door of their chamber when he stumbled over Spoilsportfor the
dog had run back to his post after vainly trying to prevent the Prophet
from leading away Jovial Luckily the dog has returned the poor little
things have been well guarded said the soldier as he opened the door
To his great surprise the room was in utter darkness

My children cried he why are you without a light There was no
answer In terror he groped his way to the bed and took the hand of one
of the sisters the hand was cold as ice

Rose my children cried he Blanche Give me some answer you
frighten me Still the same silence continued the hand which he held
remained cold and powerless and yielded passively to his touch

Just then the moon emerged from the black clouds that surrounded her
and threw sufficient light into the little room and upon the bed
which faced the window for the soldier to see that the two sisters
had fainted The bluish light of the moon added to the paleness of the
orphans they held each other in a half embrace and Rose had buried her
head on Blanches bosom

They must have fainted through fear exclaimed Dagobert running to
fetch his gourd Poor things after a day of so much excitement it is
not surprising And moistening the corner of a handkerchief with a few
drops of brandy the soldier knelt beside the bed gently chafed the
temples of the two sisters and held the linen wet with the spirituous
liquor to their little pink nostrils

Still on his knees and bending his dark anxious face over the orphans
he waited some moments before again resorting to the only restorative in
his power A slight shiver of Rose gave him renewed hope the young girl
turned her head on the pillow with a sigh then she started and
opened her eyes with an expression of astonishment and alarm but not
immediately recognizing Dagobert she exclaimed Oh sister and threw
herself into the arms of Blanche

The latter also was beginning to experience the effect of the soldiers
care The exclamation of Rose completely roused her from her lethargy
and she clung to her sister again sharing the fright without knowing
its cause

Theyve come tothats the chief point said Dagobert now we shall
soon get rid of these foolish fears Then softening his voice he
added Well my children courage You are better It is I who am
hereme Dagobert

The orphans made a hasty movement and turning towards the soldier
their sweet faces which were still full of dismay and agitation they
both by a graceful impulse extended their arms to him and cried It
is you Dagobertthen we are safe

Yes my children it is I said the veteran taking their hands in
his and pressing them joyfully So you have been much frightened
during my absence

Oh frightened to death

If you knewoh goodness if you knew

But the lamp is extinguishedwhy is that

We did not do it

Comerecover yourselves poor children and tell me all about it I
have no good opinion of this inn but luckily we shall soon leave it
It was an ill wind that blew me hitherthough to be sure there was no
other in the village But what has happened

You were hardly gone when the window flew open violently and the lamp
and table fell together with a loud crash

Then our courage failedwe screamed and clasped each other for we
thought we could hear some one moving in the room

And we were so frightened that we fainted away

Unfortunately persuaded that it was the violence of the wind which had
already broken the glass and shaken the window Dagobert attributed
this second accident to the same cause as the first thinking that he
had not properly secured the fastening and that the orphans had been
deceived by a false alarm Well wellit is over now said he to
them Calm yourselves and dont think of it any more

But why did you leave us so hastily Dagobert

Yes now I rememberdid we not hear a great noise sister and see
Dagobert run to the staircase crying My horse what are they doing to
my horse

It was then Jovial who neighed

These questions renewed the anguish of the soldier he feared to answer
them and said with a confused air YesJovial neighedbut it was
nothing By the by we must have a light here Do you know where I put
my flint and steel last evening Well I have lost my senses it is here
in my pocket Luckily too we have a candle which I am going to light
I want to look in my knapsack for some papers I require

Dagobert struck a few sparks obtained a light and saw that the window
was indeed open the table thrown down and the lamp lying by the side
of the knapsack He shut the window set the little table on its feet
again placed the knapsack upon it and began to unbuckle this last in
order to take out his portfolio which had been deposited along with his
cross and purse in a kind of pocket between the outside and the lining
The straps had been readjusted with so much care that there was no
appearance of the knapsack having been disturbed but when the soldier
plunged his hand into the pocket abovementioned he found it empty
Struck with consternation he grew pale and retreated a step crying
How is thisNothing

What is the matter said Blanche He made her no answer Motionless
he leaned against the table with his hand still buried in the pocket
Then yielding to a vague hopefor so cruel a reality did not appear
possiblehe hastily emptied the contents of the knapsack on the
tablehis poor halfworn clotheshis old uniformcoat of the
horsegrenadiers of the Imperial Guard a sacred relic for the
soldiersbut turn and return them as he would he found neither his
purse nor the portfolio that contained his papers the letters of
General Simon and his cross

In vain with that serious childishness which always accompanies a
hopeless search he took the knapsack by the two ends and shook it
vigorously nothing came out The orphans looked on with uneasiness not
understanding his silence or his movements for his back was turned
to them Blanche ventured to say to him in a timid voice What ails
youyou dont answer usWhat is it you are looking for in your
knapsack

Still mute Dagobert searched his own person turned out all his
pocketsnothingFor the first time in his life perhaps his two
children as he called them had spoken to him without receiving a
reply Blanche and Rose felt the big tears start into their eyes
thinking that the soldier was angry they darst not again address him

No no it is impossibleno said the veteran pressing his hand to
his forehead and seeking in his memory where he might have put those
precious objects the loss of which he could not yet bring himself to
believe A sudden beam of joy flashed from his eyes He ran to a chair
and took from it the portmanteau of the orphans it contained a little
linen two black dresses and a small box of white wood in which were
a silk handkerchief that had belonged to their mother two locks of her
hair and a black ribbon she had worn round her neck The little she
possessed had been seized by the Russian government in pursuance of
the confiscation Dagobert searched and researched every articlepeeped
into all the corners of the portmanteaustill nothing

This time completely worn out leaning against the table the strong
energetic man felt himself giving way His face was burning yet bathed
in a cold sweat his knees trembled under him It is a common saying
that drowning men will catch at straws and so it is with the
despair that still clings to some shred of hope Catching at a last
chanceabsurd insane impossiblehe turned abruptly towards the
orphans and said to them without considering the alteration in
his voice and features I did not give them to youto keep for
mespeak

Instead of answering Rose and Blanche terrified at his paleness and
the expression of his countenance uttered a cry Good heavens what is
the matter with you murmured Rose

Have you got themyes or no cried in a voice of thunder the
unfortunate distracted man If you have notIll take the first knife
I meet with and stick it into my body

Alas You are so good pardon us if we have done anything to afflict
you You love us so much you would not do us any harm The orphans
began to weep as they stretched forth their hands in supplication
towards the soldier

He looked at them with haggard eye without even seeing them till as
the delusion passed away the reality presented itself to his mind with
all its terrible consequences Then he clasped his hands together fell
on his knees before the bed of the orphans leaned his forehead upon
it and amid his convulsive sobsfor the man of iron sobbed like a
childthese broken words were audible Forgive meforgiveI do not
know how it can beOh what a misfortunewhat a misfortuneForgive
me

At this outbreak of grief the cause of which they understood not but
which in such a man was heartrending the two sisters wound their arms
about his old gray head and exclaimed amid their tears Look at us
Only tell us what is the matter with youIs it our fault

At this instant the noise of footsteps resounded from the stairs
mingled with the barking of Spoilsport who had remained outside the
door The nearer the steps approached the more furious became the
barking it was no doubt accompanied with hostile demonstrations for
the host was heard to cry out in an angry tone Hollo you there Call
off your dog or speak to him It is Mr Burgomaster who is coming up

Dagobertdo you hearit is the burgomaster said Rose

They are coming upstairsa number of people resumed Blanche

The word burgomaster recalled whatever had happened to the mind of
Dagobert and completed so to express it the picture of his terrible
position His horse was dead he had neither papers nor money and
a day a single days detention might defeat the last hope of the
sisters and render useless this long and toilsome journey

Men of strong minds and the veteran was of the number prefer great
perils positions of danger accurately defined to the vague anxieties
which precede a settled misfortune Guided by his good sense and
admirable devotion Dagobert understood at once that his only resource
was now in the justice of the burgomaster and that all his efforts
should tend to conciliate the favor of that magistrate He therefore
dried his eyes with the sheet rose from the ground erect calm and
resolute and said to the orphans Fear nothing my children it is our
deliverer who is at hand

Will you call off your dog or no cried the host still detained on
the stairs by Spoilsport who as a vigilant sentinel continued to
dispute the passage Is the animal mad I say Why dont you tie him
up Have you not caused trouble enough in my house I tell you that Mr
Burgomaster is waiting to examine you in your turn for he has finished
with Morok

Dagobert drew his fingers through his gray locks and across his
moustache clasped the collar of his topcoat and brushed the sleeves
with his hand in order to give himself the best appearance possible
for he felt that the fate of the orphans must depend on his interview
with the magistrate It was not without a violent beating of the heart
that he laid his hand upon the doorknob saying to the young girls who
were growing more and more frightened by such a succession of events
Hide yourselves in your bed my children if any one must needs enter
it shall be the burgomaster alone

Thereupon opening the door the soldier stepped out on the landing
place and said Down SpoilsportHere

The dog obeyed but with manifest repugnance His master had to speak
twice before he would abstain from all hostile movements towards the
host This latter with a lantern in one hand and his cap in the other
respectfully preceded the burgomaster whose magisterial proportions
were lost in the half shadows of the staircase Behind the judge and
a few steps lower the inquisitive faces of the people belonging to the
inn were dimly visible by the light of another lantern

Dagobert having turned the dog into the room shut the door after him
and advanced two steps on the landingplace which was sufficiently
spacious to hold several persons and had in one corner a wooden bench
with a back to it The burgomaster as he ascended the last stair was
surprised to see Dagobert close the door of the chamber as though he
wished to forbid his entrance Why do you shut that door asked he in
an abrupt tone

First because two girls whom I have the charge of are in bed in
that room secondly because your examination would alarm them replied
Dagobert Sit down upon this bench Mr Burgomaster and examine me
here it will not make any difference I should think

And by what right asked the judge with a displeased air do you
pretend to dictate to me the place of your examination

Oh I have no such pretension Mr Burgomaster said the soldier
hastily fearing above all things to prejudice the judge against him
only as the girls are in bed and already much frightened it would be
a proof of your good heart to examine me where I am

Humph said the magistrate with illhumor a pretty state of things
trulyIt was much worth while to disturb me in the middle of the
night But come so be it I will examine you here Then turning to
the landlord he added Put your lantern upon this bench and leave
us

The innkeeper obeyed and went down followed by his people as
dissatisfied as they were at being excluded from the examination The
veteran was left alone with the magistrate




CHAPTER XIII THE JUDGEMENT

The worthy burgomaster of Mockern wore a cloth cap and was enveloped in
a cloak He sat down heavily on the bench He was a corpulent man about
sixty with an arrogant morose countenance and he frequently rubbed
with his red fat fist eyes that were still swollen and blood shot
from his having been suddenly roused from sleep

Dagobert stood bareheaded before him with a submissive respectful air
holding his old foraging cap in his hands and trying to read in the
sullen physiognomy of his judge what chance there might be to interest
him in his favorthat is in favor of the orphans

In this critical juncture the poor soldier summoned to his aid all his
presence of mind reason eloquence and resolution He who had twenty
times braved death with the utmost coolnesswho calm and serene
because sincere and tried had never quailed before the eagleglance
of the Emperor his hero and idolnow felt himself disconcerted and
trembling before the illhumored face of a village burgomaster Even
so a few hours before he had submitted impassive and resigned to the
insults of the Prophetthat he might not compromise the sacred mission
with which a dying mother had entrusted himthus showing to what a
height of heroic abnegation it is possible for a simple and honest heart
to attain

What have you to say in your justification Come be quick said the
judge roughly with a yawn of impatience

I have not got to justify myselfI have to make a complaint Mr
Burgomaster replied Dagobert in a firm voice

Do you think you are to teach me in what terms I am to put my
questions exclaimed the magistrate in so sharp a tone that the
soldier reproached himself with having begun the interview so badly
Wishing to pacify his judge he made haste to answer with submission

Pardon me Mr Burgomaster I have illexplained my meaning I only
wished to say that I was not wrong in this affair

The Prophet says the contrary

The Prophet repeated the soldier with an air of doubt

The Prophet is a pious and honest man resumed the judge incapable
of falsehood

I cannot say anything upon that subject but you are too just and have
too good a heart Mr Burgomaster to condemn without hearing me It is
not a man like you that would do an injustice oh one can see that at a
glance

In resigning himself thus to play the part of a courtier Dagobert
softened as much as possible his gruff voice and strove to give to his
austere countenance a smiling agreeable and flattering expression
A man like you he added with redoubled suavity of manner a
respectable judge like you never shuts his ears to one side or the
other

Ears are not in question but eyes and though mine smart as if I had
rubbed them with nettles I have seen the hand of the brutetamer with
a frightful wound on it

Yes Mr Burgomaster it is very true but consider if he had shut his
cages and his door all this would not have happened

Not so it is your fault You should have fastened your horse securely
to the manger

You are right Mr Burgomaster certainly you are right said the
soldier in a still more affable and conciliating voice It is not for
a poor devil like me to contradict you But supposing my horse was
let loose out of pure malice in order that he might stray into the
menagerieyou will then acknowledge that it was not my fault That is
you will acknowledge it if you think fit hastily added the soldier I
have no right to dictate to you in anything

And why the devil should any one do you this illturn

I do not know Mr Burgomasterbut

You do not knowwell nor I either said the burgomaster impatiently
Zounds what a many words about the carcass of an old horse

The countenance of the soldier losing on a sudden its expression of
forced suavity became once more severe he answered in a grave voice
full of emotion My horse is deadhe is no more than a carcassthat
is true but an hour ago though very old he was full of life and
intelligence He neighed joyously at my voiceand every evening he
licked the hands of the two poor children whom he had carried all the
dayas formerly he had carried their mother Now he will never
carry any one again they will throw him to the dogs and all will
be finished You need not have reminded me harshly of it Mr
Burgomasterfor I loved my horse

By these words pronounced with noble and touching simplicity the
burgomaster was moved in spite of himself and regretted his hasty
speech It is natural that you should be sorry for your horse
said he in a less impatient tone but what is to be doneIt is a
misfortune

A misfortuneYes Mr Burgomaster a very great misfortune The
girls who accompany me were too weak to undertake a long journey on
foot too poor to travel in a carriageand yet we have to arrive in
Paris before the month of February When their mother died I promised
her to take them to France for these children have only me to take care
of them

You are then their

I am their faithful servant Mr Burgomaster and now that my horse
has been killed what can I do for them Come you are good you have
perhaps children of your own if one day they should find themselves
in the position of my two little orphanswith no wealth no resources
in the world but an old soldier who loves them and an old horse
to carry them alongif after being very unfortunate from their
birthyes very unfortunate for my orphans are the daughters of
exilesthey should see happiness before them at the end of a
journey and then by the death of their horse that journey become
impossibletell me Mr Burgomaster if this would not touch your
heart Would you not find as I do that the loss of my horse is
irreparable

Certainly answered the burgomaster who was not ill natured at
bottom and who could not help taking part in Dagoberts emotion I now
understand the importance of the loss you have suffered And then your
orphans interest me how old are they

Fifteen years and two months They are twins

Fifteen years and two monthsthat is about the age of my Frederica

You have a young lady of that age cried Dagobert once more awaking
to hope ah Mr Burgomaster I am really no longer uneasy about my
poor children You will do us justice

To do justice is my duty After all in this affair the faults are
about equal on both sides You tied up your horse badly and the brute
tamer left his door open He says I am wounded in the hand You
answer My horse has been killedand for a thousand reasons the loss
of my horse is irreparable

You make me speak better than I could ever speak on my own account Mr
Burgomaster said the soldier with a humble insinuating smile but
tis what I meant to expressand as you say yourself Mr Burgomaster
my horse being my whole fortune it is only fair

Exactly so resumed the magistrate interrupting the soldier your
reasons are excellent The Prophetwho is a good and pious man with all
has related the facts to me in his own way and then you see he is an
old acquaintance We are nearly all zealous Catholics here and he sells
to our wives such cheap and edifying little books with chaplets and
amulets of the best manufacture at less than the prime cost All this
you will say has nothing to do with the affair and you will be right
in saying so still I must needs confess that I came here with the
intention

Of deciding against me eh Mr Burgomaster said Dagobert gaining
more and more confidence You see you were not quite awake and your
justice had only one eye open

Really master soldier answered the judge with good humor it is not
unlikely for I did not conceal from Morok that I gave it in his favor
Then he said to me very generously by the way Since you condemn
my adversary I will not aggravate his position by telling you certain
things

What against me

Apparently so but like a generous enemy when I told him that I
should most likely condemn you to pay him damages he said no more about
it For I will not hide from you that before I heard your reasons
I fully intended that you should make compensation for the Prophets
wound

See Mr Burgomaster how the most just and able persons are subject
to be deceived said Dagobert becoming once more the courtier then
trying to assume a prodigiously knowing look he added But such
persons find out the truth at last and are not to be made dupes of
whatever prophets may say

This poor attempt at a jestthe first and only one perhaps that
Dagobert had ever been guilty ofwill show the extremity to which he
was reduced and the desperate efforts of all kinds he was making to
conciliate the good graces of his judge The burgomaster did not at
first see the pleasantry he was only led to perceive it by the self
satisfied mien of Dagobert and by his inquiring glance which seemed to
say Is it not good ehI am astonished at it myself

The magistrate began therefore to smile with a patronizing air and
nodding his head replied in the same jocular spirit Ha Ha Ha You
are right the Prophet is out in his prophecy You shall not pay him any
damages The faults on both sides are equal and the injuries balance
one another He has been wounded your horse has been killed so you may
cry quits and have done with it

But how much then do you think he owes me asked the soldier with
singular simplicity

How much

Yes Mr Burgomaster what sum will he have to pay me Yesbut before
you decide I must tell you one thing Mr Burgomaster I think I shall
be entitled to spend only part of the money in buying a horse I am
sure that in the environs of Leipsic I could get a beast very cheap
from some of the peasants and between ourselves I will own to you
that if I could meet with only a nice little donkeyI should not be
over particularI should even like it just as well for after my poor
Jovial the company of another horse would be painful to me I must also
tell you

Heyday cried the burgomaster interrupting Dagobert of what money
what donkey and what other horse are you talking I tell you that you
owe nothing to the Prophet and that he owes you nothing

He owes me nothing

You are very dull of comprehension my good man I repeat that if the
Prophets animals have killed your horse the Prophet himself has
been badly wounded so you may cry quits In other words you owe him
nothing and he owes you nothing Now do you understand

Dagobert confounded remained for some moments without answering
whilst he looked at the burgomaster with an expression of deep anguish
He saw that his judgment would again destroy all his hopes

But Mr Burgomaster resumed he in an agitated voice you are too
just not to pay attention to one thing the wound of the brutetamer
does not prevent him from continuing his trade the death of my horse
prevents me from continuing my journey therefore he ought to indemnify
me

The judge considered he had already done a good deal for Dagobert in
not making him responsible for the wound of the Prophet who as we have
already said exercised a certain influence over the Catholics of the
country by the sale of his devotional treasures and also from its being
known that he was supported by some persons of eminence The soldiers
pertinacity therefore offended the magistrate who reassuming his
lofty air replied in a chilling tone You will make me repent my
impartiality How is this Instead of thanking me you ask for more

But Mr Burgomaster I ask only for what is just I wish I were
wounded in the hand like the Prophet so that I could but continue my
journey

We are not talking of what you wish I have pronounced sentencethere
is no more to say

But Mr Burgomaster

Enough enough Let us go to the next subject Your papers

Yes we will speak about my papers but I beg of you Mr Burgomaster
to have pity on those two children Let us have the means to continue
our journey and

I have done all I could for youperhaps more than I ought Once
again your papers

I must first explain to you

No No explanationyour papersOr would you like me to have you
arrested as a vagabond

Mearrested

I tell you that if you refuse to show me your papers it will be as if
you had none Now those people who have no papers we take into custody
till the authorities can dispose of them Let me see your papers and
make hasteI am in a hurry to get home

Dagoberts position was the more distressing as for a moment he had
indulged in sanguine hope The last blow was now added to all the
veteran had suffered since the commencement of this scene which was a
cruel as well as dangerous trial for a man of his characterupright
but obstinatefaithful but rough and absolutea man who for a long
time a soldier and a victorious one had acquired a certain despotic
mariner of treating with civilians

At these wordsyour papers Dagobert became very pale but he tried
to conceal his anguish beneath an air of assurance which he thought
best calculated to gain the magistrates good opinion I will tell you
all about it Mr Burgomaster said he Nothing can be clearer Such
a thing might happen to any one I do not look like a beggar and a
vagabond do I And yetyou will understand that an honest man who
travels with two young girls

No more words Your papers

At this juncture two powerful auxiliaries arrived to the soldiers aid
The orphans growing more and more uneasy and hearing Dagobert still
talking upon the landingplace had risen and dressed themselves so
that just at the instant when the magistrate said in a rough voiceNo
more words Your papersRose and Blanche holding each other by the
hand came forth from the chamber

At sight of those charming faces which their poor mourning vestments
only rendered more interesting the burgomaster rose from his seat
struck with surprise and admiration By a spontaneous movement each
sister took a hand of Dagobert and pressed close to him whilst they
regarded the magistrate with looks of mingled anxiety and candor

It was so touching a picture this of the old soldier presenting as
it were to his judge the graceful children with countenances full of
innocence and beauty that the burgomaster by a sudden reaction found
himself once more disposed to sentiments of pity Dagobert perceived it
and still holding the orphans by the hand he advanced towards him and
said in a feeling voice Look at these poor children Mr Burgomaster
Could I show you a better passport And overcome by so many
painful sensationsrestrained yet following each other in quick
successionDagobert felt in spite of himself that the tears were
starting to his eyes

Though naturally rough and rendered still more testy by the
interruption of his sleep the burgomaster was not quite deficient in
sense of feeling He perceived at once that a man thus accompanied
ought not to inspire any great distrust Poor dear children said he
as he examined them with growing interest orphans so young and they
come from far

From the heart of Siberia Mr Burgomaster where their mother was an
exile before their birth It is now more than five months that we have
been travelling on by short stageshard enough you will say for
children of their age It is for them that I ask your favor and support
for them against whom everything seems to combine today for only just
now when I went to look for my papers I could not find in my knapsack
the portfolio in which they were along with my purse and crossfor you
must know Mr Burgomasterpardon me if I say ittis not from vain
glorybut I was decorated by the hand of the Emperor and a man whom
he decorated with his own hand you see could not be so bad a fellow
though he may have had the misfortune to lose his papersand his
purse Thats what has happened to me and made me so pressing about the
damages

How and where did you suffer this loss

I do not know Mr Burgomaster I am sure that the evening before
last at bedtime I took a little money out of the purse and saw the
portfolio in its place yesterday I had small change sufficient and did
not undo the knapsack

And where then has the knapsack been kept

In the room occupied by the children but this night

Dagobert was here interrupted by the tread of some one mounting the
stairs it was the Prophet Concealed in the shadow of the staircase he
had listened to this conversation and he dreaded lest the weakness of
the burgomaster should mar the complete success of his projects




CHAPTER XIV THE DECISION

Morok who wore his left arm in a sling having slowly ascended the
staircase saluted the burgomaster respectfully At sight of the
repulsive countenance of the liontamer Rose and Blanche affrighted
drew back a step nearer to the soldier The brow of the latter grew
dark for he felt his blood boil against Morok the cause of all
his difficultiesthough he was yet ignorant that Goliath at the
instigation of the Prophet had stolen his portfolio and papers

What did you want Morok said the burgomaster with an air half
friendly and half displeased I told the landlord that I did not wish
to be interrupted

I have come to render you a service Mr Burgomaster

A service

Yes a great service or I should not have ventured to disturb you My
conscience reproaches me

Your conscience

Yes Mr Burgomaster it reproaches me for not having told you all that
I had to tell about this man a false pity led me astray

Yell but what have you to tell

Morok approached the judge and spoke to him for sometime in a low
voice

At first apparently much astonished the burgomaster became by degrees
deeply attentive and anxious every now and then be allowed some
exclamation of surprise or doubt to escape him whilst he glanced
covertly at the group formed by Dagobert and the two young girls By
the expression of his countenance which grew every moment more unquiet
severe and searching it was easy to perceive that the interest
which the magistrate had felt for the orphans and for the soldier was
gradually changed by the secret communications of the Prophet into a
sentiment of distrust and hostility

Dagobert saw this sudden revolution and his fears which had been
appeased for an instant returned with redoubled force Rose and
Blanche confused and not understanding the object of this mute scene
looked at the soldier with increased perplexity

The devil said the burgomaster rising abruptly all of this never
occurred to me What could I have been thinking ofBut you see Morok
when one is roused up in the middle of the night one has not always
presence of mind You said well it is a great service you came to
render me

I assert nothing positively but

No matter tis a thousand to one that you are right

It is only a suspicion founded upon divers circumstances but even a
suspicion

May give you scent of the truth And here was I going like a gull into
the snareOnce more what could I have been thinking of

It is so difficult to be on guard against certain appearances

You need not tell me so my dear Morok you need not tell me so

During this mysterious conversation Dagobert was on thorns he saw
vaguely that a violent storm was about to burst He thought only of how
he should still keep his anger within bounds

Morok again approached the judge and glancing at the orphans
recommenced speaking in a low voice Oh cried the burgomaster with
indignation you go too far now

I affirm nothing said Morok hastily it is a mere supposition
founded on and he again brought his lips close to the ear of the
judge

After all why not resumed the magistrate lifting up his hands
such people are capable of anything He says that he brings them from
the heart of Siberia why may not all this prove to be a tissue of
impudent falsehoodsBut I am not to be made a dupe twice cried
the burgomaster in an angry tone for like all persons of a weak
and shifting character he was without pity for those whom he thought
capable of having beguiled his compassion

Do not be in a hurry to decidedont give to my words more weight
than they deserve resumed Morok with a hypocritical affectation of
humility I am unhappily placed in so false a position with regard to
this manpointing to Dagoberthat I might be thought to have acted
from private resentment for the injury he has done me perhaps I may so
act without knowing it while I fancy that I am only influenced by love
of justice horror of falsehood and respect for our holy religion
Wellwho lives long enough will knowand may heaven forgive me if I
am deceivedIn any case the law will pronounce upon it and if they
should prove innocent they will be released in a month or two

And for that reason I need not hesitate It is a mere measure of
precaution they will not die of it Besides the more I think of it
the more it seems probable Yes this man is doubtless a French spy
or agitator especially when I compare these suspicions with the late
demonstration of the students at Frankfort

And upon that theory nothing is better fitted to excite and stir
up those hotheaded youths than He glanced significantly at the two
sisters then after a pause he added with a sigh Satan does not care
by what means he works out his ends

Certainly it would be odious but welldevised

And then Mr Burgomaster look at him attentively you will see that
this man has a dangerous face You will see

In continuing thus to speak in a low tone Morok had evidently pointed
to Dagobert The latter notwithstanding his selfcommand felt that the
restraint he had imposed upon himself since his arrival at this unlucky
inn and above all wince the commencement of the conversation between
Morok and the burgomaster was becoming no longer bearable besides he
saw clearly that all his efforts to conciliate the favor of the judge
were rendered completely null by the fatal influence of the brutetamer
so losing patience he advanced towards him with his arms folded on his
breast and said to him in a subdued voice Was it of me that you were
whispering to Mr Burgomaster

Yes said Morok looking fixedly at him

Why did you not speak out loud Having said this the almost
convulsive movement of his thick moustache as he stood looping Morok
full in the face gave evidence of a severe internal conflict Seeing
that his adversary preserved a contemptuous silence he repeated in
a sterner voice I ask you why you did not speak out loud to Mr
Burgomaster when you were talking of me

Because there are some things so shameful that one would blush to
utter them aloud answered Morok insolently

Till then Dagobert had kept his arms folded he now extended them
violently clenching his fists This sudden movement was so expressive
that the two sisters uttered a cry of terror and drew closer to him

Hark ye Mr Burgomaster said the soldier grinding his teeth with
rage bid that man go down or I will not answer for myself

What said the burgomaster haughtily do you dare to give orders to
me

I tell you to make that man go down resumed Dagobert quite beside
himself or there will be mischief

Dagobertgood heavenbe calm cried the children grasping his
hands

It becomes you certainlymiserable vagabond that you arenot to say
worse returned the burgomaster in a rage it becomes you to give
orders to meOh you think to impose upon me by telling me you have
lost your papersIt will not serve your turn for which you carry
about with you these two girls who in spite of their innocent looks
are perhaps after all

Wretch cried Dagobert with so terrible a voice and gesture that the
official did not dare to finish Taking the children by the arm before
they could speak a word the soldier pushed them back into the chamber
then locking the door and putting the key into his pocket he returned
precipitately towards the burgomaster who frightened at the menacing
air and attitude of the veteran retreated a couple of steps and held
by one hand to the rail of the staircase

Listen to me said the soldier seizing the judge by the arm Just
now that scoundrel insulted meI bore with itfor it only concerned
myself I have heard patiently all your idle talk because you seemed
for a moment to interest yourself in those poor children But since you
have neither soul nor pity nor justiceI tell you that burgomaster
though you areI will spurn you as I would spurn that dog pointing
again to the Prophet if you have the misfortune to mention those
two young girls in any other way than you would speak of your own
childNow do you mark me

Whatyou dare to say cried the burgomaster stammering with rage
that if I happen to mention two adventuresses

Hats offwhen you speak of the daughters of the Duke of Ligny cried
the soldier snatching the cap of the burgomaster and flinging it on
the ground On this act of aggression Morok could not restrain his joy
Exasperated and losing all hope Dagobert had at length yielded to the
violence of his anger after struggling so painfully against it for some
hours

When the burgomaster saw his cap at his feet he looked at the brute
tamer with an air of stupefaction as if he hesitated to believe so
great an enormity Dagobert regretting his violence and feeling that
no means of conciliation note remained threw a rapid glance around
him and retreating several paces gained the topmost steps of the
staircase The burgomaster stood near the bench in a corner of the
landingplace whilst Morok with his arm in the sling to give the more
serious appearance to his wound was close beside him So cried the
magistrate deceived by the backward movement of Dagobert you think to
escape after daring to lift hand against meOld villain

Forgive me Mr Burgomaster It was a burst of rashness that I was not
able to control I am sorry for it said Dagobert in a repentant voice
and hanging his head humbly

No pity for thee rascal You would begin again to smooth me over with
your coaxing ways but I have penetrated your secret designs You are
not what you appear to be and there is perhaps an affair of state at
the bottom of all this added the magistrate in a very diplomatic
tone All means are alike to those who wish to set Europe in flames

I am only a poor devil Mr Burgomaster you that have a good heart
will show me some mercy

What when you have pulled off my cap

And you added the soldier turning towards Morok you that
have been the cause of all thishave same pity upon medo not bear
maliceYou a holy man speak a word in my favor to Mr Burgomaster

I have spoken to him what I was bound to speak answered the Prophet
ironically

Oho you can look foolish enough now you old vagabond Did you think
to impose on me with lamentations resumed the burgomaster advancing
towards Dagobert Thanks be I am no longer your dupeYou shall see
that we have good dungeons at Leipsic for French agitators and female
vagrants for your damsels are no better than you are Come added he
puffing out his cheeks with an important air go down before meand as
for you Morok

The burgomaster was unable to finish For some minutes Dagobert had only
sought to gain time and had cast many a sideglance at a halfopen
door on the landingplace just opposite to the chamber occupied by the
orphans finding the moment favorable he now rushed quick as lightning
on the burgomaster seized him by the throat and dashed him with such
violence against the door in question that the magistrate stupefied
by this sudden attack and unable to speak a word or utter a cry rolled
over to the further end of the room which was completely dark Then
turning towards Morok who with his arm encumbered by the sling made
a rush for the staircase the soldier caught him by his long streaming
hair pulled him back clasped him with hands of iron clapped his hand
over his mouth to stifle his outcries and notwithstanding his desperate
resistance dragged him into the chamber on the floor of which the
burgomaster lay bruised and stunned

Having doublelocked the door and put the key in his pocket Dagobert
descended the stairs at two bounds and found himself in a passage that
opened on the courtyard The gate of the inn was shut and there was no
possibility of escape on that side The rain fell in torrents He could
see through the window of a parlor in which a fire was burning the
host and his people waiting for the decision of the burgomaster To bolt
the door of the passage and thus intercept all communication with the
yard was for the soldier the affair of an instant and he hastened
upstairs again to rejoin the orphans

Morok recovering from his surprise was calling for help with all his
might but even if the distance had permitted him to be heard the
noise of the wind and rain would have drowned his outcries Dagobert
had about an hour before him for it would require some time to elapse
before the length of his interview with the magistrate would excite
astonishment and suspicion or fear once awakened it would be
necessary to break open two doorsthat which separated the passage from
the courtyard and that of the room in which the burgomaster and the
Prophet were confined

My children it is now time to prove that you have a soldiers blood
in your veins said Dagobert as he entered abruptly the chamber of the
young girls who were terrified at the racket they had heard for some
minutes

Good heaven Dagobert what has happened cried Blanche

What do you wish us to do added Rose

Without answering the soldier ran to the bed tore off the sheets tied
them strongly together made a knot at one end passed it over the top
of the left half of the casement and so shut it in Thus made fast by
the size of the knot which could not slip through the sheets floating
on the outside touched the ground The second half of the window was
left open to afford a passage to the fugitives

The veteran next took his knapsack the childrens portmanteau and the
reindeer pelisse and threw them all out of the window making a sign to
Spoilsport to follow to watch over them The dog did not hesitate but
disappeared at a single bound Rose and Blanche looked at Dagobert in
amazement without uttering a word

Now children said he to them the doors of the inn are shut and it
is by this way pointing to the window that we must passif we
would not be arrested put in prisonyou in one place and I in the
otherand have our journey altogether knocked on the head

Arrested put in prison cried Rose

Separated from you exclaimed Blanche

Yes my poor childrenThey have killed Jovialwe must make our
escape on foot and try to reach Leipsicwhen you are tired I will
carry you and though I have to beg my way we will go through with it
But a quarter of an hour later and all will be lost Come children
have trust in meshow that the daughters of General Simon are no
cowardsand there is yet hope

By a sympathetic movement the sisters joined hands as though they
would meet the danger united Their sweet faces pale from the effect of
so many painful emotions were now expressive of simple resolve founded
on the blind faith they reposed in the devotion of the soldier

Be satisfied Dagobert well not be frightened said Rose in a firm
voice

We will do what must be done added Blanche in a no less resolute
tone

I was sure of it cried Dagobert good blood is ever thicker than
water Come you are light as feathers the sheet is strong it is
hardly eight feet to the ground and the pup is waiting for you

It is for me to go firstI am the eldest for today cried Rose when
she had tenderly embraced Blanche and she ran to the window in order
if there were any danger to expose herself to it before her sister

Dagobert easily guessed the cause of this eagerness Dear children
said he I understand you But fear nothing for one anotherthere is
no danger I have myself fastened the sheet Quick my little Rose

As light as a bird the young girl mounted the ledge of the window
and assisted by Dagobert took hold of the sheet and slid gently down
according to the recommendation of the soldier who leaning out his
whole body encouraged her with his voice

Dont be afraid sister said she as soon as she touched the ground
it is very easy to come down this way And Spoilsport is here licking
my hands Blanche did not long keep her waiting as courageous as her
sister she descended with the same success

Dear little creatures what have they done to be so
unfortunateThousand thunders there must be a curse upon the family
cried Dagobert as with heavy heart he saw the pale sweet face of
the young girl disappear amid the gloom of the dark night which violent
squalls of wind and torrents of rain rendered still more dismal

Dagobert we are waiting for you come quickly said the orphans in
a low voice from beneath the window Thanks to his tall stature the
soldier rather leaped than glided to the ground

Dagobert and the two young girls had not fled from the inn of the White
Falcon more than a quarter of an hour when a long crash resounded
through the house The door had yielded to the efforts of the
burgomaster and Morok who had made use of a heavy table as a battering
ram Guided by the light they ran to the chamber of the orphans now
deserted Morok saw the sheets floating from the casement and cried
Mr Burgomaster they have escaped by the windowthey are on footin
this dark and stormy night they cannot be far

No doubt we shall catch them the miserable tramps Oh I will be
revenged Quick Morok your honor is concerned as well as mine

My honorMuch more is concerned than that Mr Burgomaster answered
the Prophet in a tone of great irritation Then rapidly descending the
stairs he opened the door of the courtyard and shouted in a voice of
thunder

Goliath unchain the dogsand landlord bring us lanterns
torchesarm your peopleopen the doorsWe must pursue the fugitives
they cannot escape us we must have themalive or dead




CHAPTER XV THE DESPATCHES

When we read in the rules of the order of the Jesuits under the title
De formula scribendi Institut 2 11 p 125 129 the development
of the 8th part of the constitutions we are appalled by the number of
letters narratives registers and writings of all kinds preserved in
the archives of the society

It is a police infinitely more exact and better informed than has ever
been that of any state Even the government of Venice found itself
surpassed by the Jesuits when it drove them out in 1606 it seized
all their papers and reproached them for their great and laborious
curiosity This police this secret inquisition carried to such
a degree of perfection may give some idea of the strength of a
government so wellinformed so persevering in its projects so powerful
by its unity and as the constitutions have it by the union of its
members It is not hard to understand what immense force must belong to
the heads of this society and how the general of the Jesuits could say
to the Duke de Brissac From this room your grace I govern not only
Paris but Chinanot only China but the whole worldand all without
any one knowing how it is done Constitution of the Jesuits edited by
Paulin Paris 1843

Morok the liontamer seeing Dagobert deprived of his horse and
stripped of his money and papers and thinking it was thus out of his
power to continue his journey had previous to the arrival of the
burgomaster despatched Karl to Leipsic as the bearer of a letter which
he was to put immediately into the post The address of this letter was
as follows A Monsieur Rodin Rue du Milieu des Ursins Paris

About the middle of this obscure and solitary street situate below the
level of the Quai Napoleon which it joins not far from the Rue Saint
Landry there stood a house of unpretentious appearance at the bottom
of a dark and narrow courtyard separated from the street by a low
building in front with arched doorway and two windows protected by
thick iron bars Nothing could be more simple than the interior of this
quiet dwelling as was sufficiently shown by the furniture of a pretty
large room on the ground floor The walls of this apartment were lined
with old gray wainscot the tiled floor was painted red and carefully
polished curtains of white calico shaded the windows

A sphere of about four feet in diameter raised on a pedestal of massive
oak stood at one end of the room opposite to the fireplace Upon this
globe which was painted on a large scale a host of little red crosses
appeared scattered over all parts of the worldfrom the North to the
South from the rising to the setting sun from the most barbarous
countries from the most distant isles to the centres of civilization
to France itself There was not a single country which did not present
some spots marked with these red crosses evidently indicative of
stations or serving as points of reference

Before a table of black wood loaded with papers and resting against
the wall near the chimney a chair stood empty Further on between the
two windows was a large walnutwood desk surmounted by shelves full of
pasteboard boxes

At the end of the month of October 1831 about eight oclock in
the morning a man sat writing at this desk This was M Rodin the
correspondent of Morok the brutetamer

About fifty years of age he wore an old shabby olive greatcoat with
a greasy collar a snuffpowdered cotton handkerchief for a cravat and
waistcoat and trousers of threadbare black cloth His feet buried in
loose varnished shoes rested on a petty piece of green baize upon
the red polished floor His gray hair lay flat on his temples and
encircled his bald forehead his eyebrows were scarcely marked his
upper eyelid flabby and overhanging like the membrane which shades the
eyes of reptiles half concealed his small sharp black eye His thin
lips absolutely colorless were hardly distinguishable from the wan hue
of his lean visage with its pointed nose and chin and this livid mask
deprived as it were of lips appeared only the more singular from
its maintaining a deathlike immobility Had it not been for the rapid
movement of his fingers as bending over the desk he scratched along
with his pen M Rodin might have been mistaken for a corpse

By the aid of a cipher or secret alphabet placed before him he was
copying certain passages from a long sheet full of writing in a manner
quite unintelligible to those who did not possess the key to the system
Whilst the darkness of the day increased the gloom of the large cold
nakedlooking apartment there was something awful in the chilling
aspect of this man tracing his mysterious characters in the midst of
profound silence

The clock struck eight The dull sound of the knocker at the outer door
was heard then a bell tinkled twice several doors opened and shut and
a new personage entered the chamber On seeing him M Rodin rose
from the desk stuck his pen between his teeth bowed with a deeply
submissive air and sat down again to his work without uttering a word

The two formed a striking contrast to one another The newcomer though
really older than he seemed would have passed for thirtysix or thirty
eight years of age at most His figure was tall and shapely and few
could have encountered the brightness of his large gray eye brilliant
as polished steel His nose broad at the commencement formed a
wellcut square at its termination his chin was prominent and the
bluish tints of his closeshaved beard were contrasted with the bright
carnation of his lips and the whiteness of his fine teeth When he took
off his hat to change it for a black velvet cap which he found on the
small table he displayed a quantity of light chestnut hair not yet
silvered by time He was dressed in a long frockcoat buttoned up to
the neck in military fashion

The piercing glance and broad forehead of this man revealed a powerful
intellect even as the development of his chest and shoulders announced
a vigorous physical organization whilst his gentlemanly appearance the
perfection of his gloves and boots the light perfume which hung about
his hair and person the grace and ease of his least movements betrayed
what is called the man of the world and left the impression that he
had sought or might still seek every kind of success from the most
frivolous to the most serious This rare combination of strength of
mind strength of body and extreme elegance of manners was in this
instance rendered still more striking by the circumstance that whatever
there might be of haughtiness or command in the upper part of that
energetic countenance was softened down and tempered by a constant
but not uniform smilefor as occasion served this smile became
either kind or sly cordial or gay discreet or prepossessing and thus
augmented the insinuating charm of this man who once seen was never
again forgotten But in yielding to this involuntary sympathy the
doubt occurred if the influence was for goodor for evil

M Rodin the secretary of the newcomer continued to write

Are there any letters from Dunkirk Rodin inquired his master

Post not yet in

Without being positively uneasy as to my mothers health since she
was already convalescent resumed the other I shall only be quite
reassured by a letter from my excellent friend the Princess de Saint
Dizier I shall have good news this morning I hope

It is to be desired said the secretary as humble and submissive as
he was laconic and impassible

Certainly it is to be desired resumed his master for one of
the brightest days of my life was when the Princess de SaintDizier
announced to me that this sudden and dangerous illness had yielded to
the care and attention with which she surrounds my mother Had it not
been for that I must have gone down to her instantly though my presence
here is very necessary

Then approaching the desk he added Is the summary of the foreign
correspondence complete

Here is the analysis

The letters are still sent under envelope to the places named and are
then brought here as I directed

Always

Read to me the notes of this correspondence if there are any letters
for me to answer I will tell you And Rodins master began to walk
up and down the room with his hands crossed behind his back dictating
observations of which Rodin took careful note

The secretary turned to a pretty large pile of papers and thus began

Don Raymond Olivarez acknowledges from Cadiz receipt of letter No19
he will conform to it and deny all share in the abduction

Very well file it

Count Romanoff of Riga finds himself in a position of pecuniary
embarrassment

Let Duplessis send him fifty louis I formerly served as captain in his
regiment and he has since given us good information

They have received at Philadelphia the last cargo of Histories of
France expurgated for the use of the faithful they require some more of
the same sort

Take note of it and write to Duplessis Go on

M Spindler sends from Namur the secret report on M Ardouin

To be examined

M Ardouin sends from the same town the secret report on M Spindler

To be examined

Doctor Van Ostadt of the same town sends a confidential note on the
subject of Messrs Spindler and Ardouin

To be compared Go on

Count Malipierri of Turin announces that the donation of 300000
francs is signed

Inform Duplessis What next

Don Stanislaus has just quitted the waters of Baden with Queen Marie
Ernestine He informs us that her majesty will receive with gratitude
the promised advices and will answer them with her own hand

Make a note of it I will myself write to the queen

Whilst Rodin was inscribing a few remarks on the margin of the paper
his master continuing to walk up and down the room found himself
opposite to the globe marked with little red crosses and stood
contemplating it for a moment with a pensive air

Rodin continued In consequence of the state of the public mind in
certain parts of Italy where sundry agitators have turned their eyes in
the direction of France Father Arsenio writes from Milan that it would
be of importance to distribute profusely in that country some little
book in which the French would be represented as impious and debauched
rapacious and bloody

The idea is excellent We might turn to good account the excesses
committed by our troops in Italy during the wars of the Republic You
must employ Jacques Dumoulin to write it He is full of gall spite
and venom the pamphlet will be scorching Besides I may furnish a
few notes but you must not pay Dumoulin till after delivery of the
manuscript

That is well understood for if we were to pay him beforehand he
would be drunk for a week in some low den It was thus we had to pay
him twice over for his virulent attack on the pantheistic tendencies of
Professor Martins philosophy

Take note of itand go on

The merchant announces that the clerk is about to send the banker to
give in his accounts You understand added Rodin after pronouncing
these words with a marked emphasis

Perfectly said the other with a start they are but the expressions
agreed on What next

But the clerk continued the secretary is restrained by a last
scruple

After a moments silence during which the features of Rodins master
worked strongly he thus resumed They must continue to act on the
clerks mind by silence and solitude then let him read once more the
list of cases in which regicide is authorized and absolved Go on

The woman Sydney writes from Dresden that she waits for instructions
Violent scenes of jealousy on her account have again taken place between
the father and son but neither from these new bursts of mutual hatred
nor from the confidential communications which each has made to her
against his rival has she yet been able to glean the information
required Hitherto she has avoided giving the preference to one or the
other but should this situation be prolonged she fears it may rouse
their suspicion Which ought she then to choosethe father or the son

The sonfor jealous resentment will be much more violent and cruel in
the old man and to revenge himself for the preference bestowed upon
his son he will perhaps tell what they have both such an interest to
conceal The next

Within the last three years two maidservants of Ambrosius whom
we placed in that little parish in the mountains of the Valais have
disappeared without any one knowing what has become of them A third
has just met with the same fate The Protestants of the country are
rousedtalk of murder with frightful attendant circumstances

Until there is proof positive and complete of the fact Ambrosius must
be defended against these infamous calumnies the work of a party that
never shrinks from monstrous inventions Go on

Thompson of Liverpool has at length succeeded in procuring for Justin
the place of agent or manager to Lord Stewart a rich Irish Catholic
whose head grows daily weaker

Let the fact be once verified and Thompson shall have a premium of
fifty louis Make a note of it for Duplessis Proceed

Frantz Dichstein of Vienna resumed Rodin announces that his father
has just died of the cholera in a little village at some leagues from
that city for the epidemic continues to advance slowly coming from the
north of Russia by way of Poland

It is true said Rodins master interrupting him may its terrible
march be stayed and France be spared

Frantz Dichstein resumed Rodin says that his two brothers are
determined to contest the donation made by his father but that he is of
an opposite opinion

Consult the two persons that are charged with all matters of
litigation What next

The Cardinal Prince dAmalfi will conform to the three first points of
the proposal he demands to make a reservation upon the fourth point

No reserveEither full and absolute acceptanceor else warand
mark me well war without mercyon him and his creatures Go on

Fra Paolo announces that the Prince Boccari chief of a redoubtable
secret society in despair at seeing his friends accuse him of
treachery in consequence of suspicions excited in their minds by Fra
Paolo himself has committed suicide

Boccari is it possible cried Rodins master Boccari the patriot
Boccari so dangerous a person

The patriot Boccari repeated the impassible secretary

Tell Duplessis to send an order for fiveandtwenty louis to Fra Paolo
Make a note of it

Hausman informs us that the French dancer Albertine Ducornet is the
mistress of the reigning prince she has the most complete influence
over him and it would be easy through her means to arrive at the end
proposed but that she is herself governed by her lover condemned in
France as a forger and that she does nothing without consulting him

Let Hausman get hold of this manif his claims are reasonable accede
to themand learn if the girl has any relations in Paris

The Duke dOrbano announces that the king his master will authorize
the new establishment but on the conditions previously stated

No conditioneither a frank adhesion or a positive refusal Let
us know our friends from our enemies The more unfavorable the
circumstances the more we must show firmness and overbear opposition
by confidence in ourselves

The same also announces that the whole of the corps diplomatique
continues to support the claims of the father of that young Protestant
girl who refuses to quit the convent where she has taken refuge unless
it be to marry her lover against her fathers will

Ah the corps diplomatique continues to remonstrate in the fathers
name

Yes

Then continue to answer that the spiritual power has nothing to do
with the temporal

At this moment the bell of the outer door again sounded twice See who
it is said Rodins master and the secretary rose and left the room
The other continued to walk thoughtfully up and down till coming near
to the huge globe he stopped short before it

For some time he contemplated in profound silence the innumerable
little red crosses which appeared to cover as with an immense net all
the countries of the earth Reflecting doubtless on the invisible action
of his power which seemed to extend over the whole world the features
of this man became animated his large gray eye sparkled his nostrils
swelled and his manly countenance assumed an indescribable expression
of pride energy and daring With haughty brow and scornful lip he
drew still nearer to the globe and leaned his strong hand upon the
pole

This powerful pressure an imperious movement as of one taking
possession seemed to indicate that he felt sure of governing this
globe on which he looked down from the height of his tall figure
and on which he rested his hand with so lofty and audacious an air of
sovereignty

But now he no longer smiled His eye threatened and his large forehead
was clad with a formidable scowl The artist who had wished to
paint the demon of craft and pride the infernal genius of insatiable
domination could not have chosen a more suitable model

When Rodin returned the face of his master had recovered its ordinary
expression It is the postman said Rodin showing the letters which
he held in his hand there is nothing from Dunkirk

Nothing cried his masterand his painful emotion formed a
strange contrast to his late haughty and implacable expression of
countenancenothing no news of my motherThirtysix hours more
then of anxiety

It seems to me that if the princess had bad news to give she would
have written Probably the improvement goes on

You are doubtless right Rodinbut no matterI am far from easy If
tomorrow the news should not be completely satisfactory I set out for
the estate of the princess Why would my mother pass the autumn in that
part of the country The environs of Dunkirk do not I fear agree with
her

After a few moments silence he added as he continued to walk
Wellthese letterswhence are they

Rodin looked at the postmarks and replied Out of the four there are
three relative to the great and important affairs of the medals

Thank heavenprovided the news be favorable cried his master
with an expression of uneasiness which showed how much importance he
attached to this affair

One is from Charlestown and no doubt relative to Gabriel the
missionary answered Rodin this other from Batavia and no doubt
concerns the Indian Djalma The third is from Leipsic and will
probably confirm that received yesterday in which the liontamer
Morok informed us that in accordance with his orders and without his
being compromised in any way the daughters of General Simon would not
be able to continue their journey

At the name of General Simon a cloud passed over the features of
Rodins master




CHAPTER XVI THE ORDERS

The principal houses correspond with that in Paris they are also
in direct communication with the General who resides at Rome The
correspondence of the Jesuits so active various and organized in so
wonderful a manner has for its object to supply the heads with all the
information they can require Every day the General receives a host
of reports which serve to check one another In the central house at
Rome are immense registers in which are inscribed the names of all
the Jesuits of their adherents and of all the considerable persons
whether friends or enemies with whom they have any connection In these
registers are reported without alteration hatred or passion the
facts relating to the life of each individual It is the most gigantic
biographical collection that has ever been formed The frailties of a
woman the secret errors of a statesman are chronicled in this book
with the same cold impartiality Drawn up for the purpose of being
useful these biographies are necessarily exact When the Jesuits wish
to influence an individual they have but to turn to this book and they
know immediately his life his character his parts his faults his
projects his family his friends his most sacred ties Conceive
what a superior facility of action this immense policeregister which
includes the whole world must give to any one society It is not
lightly that I speak of these registers I have my facts from a person
who has seen this collection and who is perfectly well acquainted with
the Jesuits Here then is matter to reflect on for all those families
who admit freely into their houses the members of a community that
carries its biographical researches to such a point Libri Member of
the Institute Letters on the Clergy

When he had conquered the involuntary emotion which the name or
remembrance of General Simon had occasioned Rodins master said to the
secretary Do not yet open the letters from Leipsic Charlestown and
Batavia the information they contain will doubtless find its place
presently It will save our going over the same ground twice

The secretary looked inquiringly at his master

The latter continuedHave you finished the note relating to the
medals

Here it is replied the secretary I was just finishing my
interpretation of the cipher

Read it to me in the order of the facts You can append to it the news
contained in those three letters

True said Rodin in that way the letters will find their right
place

I wish to see rejoined the other whether this note is clear and
fully explanatory you did not forget that the person it is intended for
ought not to know all

I bore it in mind and drew up the paper accordingly

Read said the master

M Rodin read as follows slowly and deliberately

A hundred and fifty years ago a French Protestant family foreseeing
the speedyrevocation of the edict of Nantes went into voluntary
exile in order to avoid the just and rigorous decrees already issued
against the members of the reformed churchthose indomitable foes of
our holy religion

Some members of this family sought refuge in Holland and afterwards
in the Dutch colonies others in Poland others in Germany some in
England and some in America

It is supposed that only seven descendants remain of this family
which underwent strange vicissitudes since its present representatives
are found in all ranks of society from the sovereign to the mechanic

These descendants direct or indirect are

On the mothers side

Rose and Blanche Simonminors

General Simon married at Warsaw a descendant of the said family

Francois Hardy manufacturer at Plessis near Paris

Prince Djalma son of Kadjasing King of Mondi

Kadjasing married in 1802 a descendant of the said family then
settled at Batavia in the Island of Java a Dutch colony

On the fathers sideJacques Rennepont surnamed Sleepinbuff
mechanic

Adrienne de Cardoville daughter of the Count of Rennepont Duke of
Cardoville

Gabriel Rennepont priest of the foreign missions

All the members of this family possess or should possess a bronze
medal bearing the following inscriptions

 Victim
 of
 L C D J
 Pray for me
 Paris
 February the 13th 1682

 At Paris
 Rue Saint Francois No 3
 In a century and a half
 you will be
 February the 13th 1832
 Pray For Me

These words and dates show that all of them have a great interest to
be at Paris on the 13th of February 1832 and that not by proxy but
in person whether they are minors married or single

But other persons have an immense interest that none of the
descendants of this family be at Paris on the 13th February except
Gabriel Rennepont priest of the foreign missions

At all hazards therefore Gabriel must be the only person present at
the appointment made with the descendants of this family a century and
a half ago

To prevent the other six persons from reaching Paris on the said day
or to render their presence of no effect much has been already done
but much remains to be done to ensure the success of this affair
which is considered as the most vital and most important of the age on
account of its probable results

Tis but too true observed Rodins master interrupting him and
shaking his head pensively And moreover that the consequences of
success are incalculable and there is no forseeing what may follow
failure In a word it almost involves a question of existence or non
existence during several years To succeed therefore all possible
means must be employed Nothing must be shunned except however that
appearances must be skillfully maintained

I have written it said Rodin having added the words his master had
just dictated who then said

Continue

Rodin read on

To forward or secure the affair in question it is necessary to give
some private and secret particulars respecting the seven persons who
represent this family

The truth of these particulars may be relied on In case of need
they might be completed in the most minute degree for contradictory
information having been given very lengthened evidence has been
obtained The order in which the names of the persons stand will be
observed and events that have happened up to the present time will only
be mentioned

NOTE No I Rose and Blanche Simon twin sisters about fifteen
years of age very pretty so much alike one might be taken for the
other mild and timid disposition but capable of enthusiasm Brought
up in Siberia by their mother a woman of strong mind and deistical
sentiments they are wholly ignorant of our holy religion

General Simon separated from his wife before they were born is not
aware even now that he has two daughters

It was hoped that their presence in Paris on the 13th of February
would be prevented by sending their mother to a place of exile much
more distant than the one first allotted her but their mother dying
the Governor of Siberia who is wholly ours supposing by a deplorable
mistake that the measure only affected the wife of General Simon
personally unfortunately allowed the girls to return to France under
the guidance of an old soldier

This man is enterprising faithful and determined He is noted down
as dangerous

The Simon girls are inoffensive It is hoped on fair grounds that
they are now detained in the neighborhood of Leipsic

Rodins master interrupted him saying

Now read the letter just received from Leipsic it may complete the
information

Rodin read it and exclaimed

Excellent news The maidens and their guide had succeeded in escaping
during the night from the White Falcon Tavern but all three were
overtaken and seized about a league from Mockern They have been
transferred to Leipsic where they are imprisoned as vagabonds
their guide the soldier is accused and condemned of resisting the
authorities and using violence to a magistrate

It is almost certain then considering the tedious mode of proceeding
in Germany otherwise we would see to it that the girls will not be
able to be here on the 13th February added Rodins master Append
this to the note on the back

The secretary obeyed and endorsed An abstract of Moroks letter

It is written he then added

Go on resumed his master

Rodin continued reading

NOTE No II Francois Hardy manufacturer at Plessis near
Paris forty years old a steady rich intelligent active honest
wellinformed man idolized by his workmenthanks to numberless
innovations to promote their welfare Never attending to the duties of
our holy religion Noted down as a very dangerous man but the hatred
and envy he excites among other manufacturers especially in M le Baron
Tripeaud his competitor may easily be turned against him If other
means of action on his account and against him are necessary the
evidence may be consulted it is very voluminous This man has been
marked and watched for a long time

He has been so effectually misguided with respect to the medal that
he is completely deceived as to the interests it represents He
is however constantly watched surrounded and governed without
suspecting it one of his dearest friends deceives him and through his
means we know his secret thoughts

NOTE No III Prince Djalma eighteen energetic and generous
haughty independent and wild favorite of General Simon who commanded
the troops of his father Kadjasing in the struggle maintained by the
latter against the English in India Djalma is mentioned only by way of
reminder for his mother died young while her parents were living They
resided at Batavia On the death of the latter neither Djalma nor
the king his father claimed their little property It is therefore
certain that they are ignorant of the grave interests connected with the
possession of the medal in question which formed part of the property
of Djalmas mother

Rodins master interrupted him

Now read the letter from Batavia and complete the information
respecting Djalma

Rodin read and then observed

Good news again Joshua Van Dael merchant at Batavia he was educated
in our Pondicherry establishment learns from his correspondent at
Calcutta that the old Indian king was killed in the last battle with
the English His son Djalma deprived of the paternal throne is
provisionally detained as a prisoner of state in an Indian fortress

We are at the end of October said Rodins master If Prince Djalma
were to leave India now he could scarcely reach Paris by the month of
February

Van Dael continued Rodin regrets that he has not been able to prove
his zeal in this case Supposing Prince Djalma set at liberty or having
effected his escape it is certain he would come to Batavia to claim his
inheritance from his mother since he has nothing else left him in the
world In that case you may rely on Van Daels devotedness In return
he solicits very precise information by the next post respecting the
fortune of M le Baron Tripeaud banker and manufacturer with whom he
has business transactions

Answer that point evasively Van Dael as yet has only shown zeal
complete the information respecting Djalma from these new tidings

Rodin wrote

But in a few minutes his master said to him with a singular expression

Does not Van Dael mention General Simon in connection with Djalmas
imprisonment and his fathers death

He does not allude to him said the secretary continuing his task

Rodins master was silent and paced the room

In a few moments Rodin said to him I have done it

Go on then

NOTE No IV Jacques Rennepont surnamed Sleepinbuff ie Lie
naked workman in Baron Tripeauds factory This artisan is drunken
idle noisy and prodigal he is not without sense but idleness and
debauch have ruined him A clever agent on whom we rely has become
acquainted with his mistress Cephyse Soliveau nicknamed the Bacchanal
Queen Through her means the agent has formed such ties with him that
he may even now be considered beyond the reach of the interests that
ought to insure his presence in Paris on the 13th of February

NOTE No V Gabriel Rennepont priest of foreign missions distant
relation of the above but he is alike ignorant of the existence of his
relative and the relationship An orphan foundling he was adopted by
Frances Baudoin the wife of a soldier going by the name Dagobert

Should this soldier contrary to expectation reach Paris his wife
would be a powerful means of influencing him She is an excellent
creature ignorant and credulous of exemplary piety over whom we have
long had unlimited control She prevailed on Gabriel to take orders
notwithstanding his repugnance

Gabriel is fiveandtwenty disposition as angelic as his countenance
rare and solid virtues unfortunately he was brought up with his
adopted brother Agricola Dagoberts son This Agricola is a poet
and workmanbut an excellent workman he is employed by M Hardy
has imbibed the most detestable doctrines fond of his mother honest
laborious but without religious feeling Marked as very dangerous This
causes his intimacy with Gabriel to be feared

The latter notwithstanding his excellent qualities sometimes causes
uneasiness We have even delayed confiding in him fully A false step
might make him too one of the most dangerous Much precaution must be
used then especially till the 13th of February since we repeat it
on him on his presence in Paris at that time depend immense hopes and
equally important interests

Among other precautions we have consented to his taking part in the
American mission for he unites with angelic sweetness of character a
calm intrepidity and adventurous spirit which could only be satisfied
by allowing him to engage in the perilous existence of the missionaries
Luckily his superiors at Charlestown have received the strictest orders
not to endanger on any account so precious a life They are to send
him to Paris at least a month or two before February 13th

Rodins master again interrupted him and said Read the letter
from Charlestown and see what it tells you in order to complete the
information upon this point also

When he had read the letter Rodin went on Gabriel is expected every
day from the Rocky Mountains whither he had absolutely insisted on
going alone upon a mission

What imprudence

He has no doubt escaped all danger as he himself announces his speedy
return to Charlestown As soon as he arrives which cannot they write
be later than the middle of this month he will be shipped off for
France

Add this to the note which concerns him said Rodins master

It is written replied the secretary a few moments later

Proceed then said his master Rodin continued

NOTE No VI ADRIENNE RENNEPONT DE CARDOVILLE

Distantly related without knowing it to Jacques Rennepont alias
Sleepinbuff and Gabriel Rennepont missionary priest She will soon
be twentyone years of age the most attractive person in the
worldextraordinary beauty though redhaireda mind remarkable
for its originalityimmense fortuneall the animal instincts The
incredible independence of her character makes one tremble for the
future fate of this young person Happily her appointed guardian Baron
Tripeaud a baron of 1829 creation formerly agent to the late Count of
Rennepont Duke of Cardoville is quite in the interest and almost in
the dependence of the young ladys aunt We count with reason upon
this worthy and respectable relative and on the Baron Tripeaud to
oppose and repress the singular unheardof designs which this young
person as resolute as independent does not fear to avowand which
unfortunately cannot be turned to account in the interest of the affair
in questionfor

Rodin was here interrupted by two discreet taps at the door The
secretary rose went to see who knocked remained a moment without and
then returned with two letters in his hand saying The princess has
profited by the departure of a courier to

Give me the letter cried his master without leaving him time to
finish At length he added I shall have news of my mother

He had scarcely read the first few lines of the letter when he grew
deadly pale and his features took an expression of painful astonishment
and poignant grief My mother he cried oh heavens my mother

What misfortune has happened asked Rodin with a look of alarm as he
rose at the exclamation of his master

The symptoms of improvement were fallacious replied the other
dejectedly she has now relapsed into a nearly hopeless state And
yet the doctor thinks my presence might save her for she calls for me
without ceasing She wishes to see me for the last time that she
may die in peace Oh that wish is sacred Not to grant it would be
matricide If I can but arrive in time Travelling day and night it
will take nearly two days

Alas what a misfortune said Rodin wringing his hands and raising
his eyes to heaven

His master rang the bell violently and said to the old servant that
opened the door Just put what is indispensable into the portmanteau
of my travellingcarriage Let the porter take a cab and go for
post horses instantly Within an hour I must be on the road Mother
mother cried he as the servant departed in haste Not to see her
againoh it would be frightful And sinking upon a chair overwhelmed
with sorrow he covered his face with his hands

This great grief was sincerehe loved tenderly his mother that divine
sentiment had accompanied him unalterable and pure through all the
phases of a too often guilty life

After a few minutes Rodin ventured to say to his master as he showed
him the second letter This also has just been brought from M
Duplessis It is very importantvery pressing

See what it is and answer it I have no head for business

The letter is confidential said Rodin presenting it to his master
I dare not open it as you may see by the mark on the cover

At sight of this mark the countenance of Rodins master assumed an
indefinable expression of respect and fear With a trembling hand he
broke the seal The note contained only the following words Leave all
business and without losing a minute set out and come M Duplessis
will replace you He has orders

Great God cried this man in despair Set out before I have seen my
mother It is frightful impossibleit would perhaps kill heryes it
would be matricide

Whilst he uttered these words his eyes rested on the huge globe marked
with red crosses A sudden revolution seemed to take place within him
he appeared to repent of the violence of his regrets his face though
still sad became once more calm and grave He handed the fatal letter
to his secretary and said to him whilst he stifled a sigh To be
classed under its proper number

Rodin took the letter wrote a number upon it and placed it in a
particular box After a moments silence his master resumed You will
take orders from M Duplessis and work with him You will deliver to
him the note on the affair of the medals he knows to whom to address
it You will write to Batavia Leipsic and Charlestown in the sense
agreed Prevent at any price the daughters of General Simon from
quitting Leipsic hasten the arrival of Gabriel in Paris and should
Prince Djalma come to Batavia tell M Joshua Van Dael that we count on
his zeal and obedience to keep him there

And this man who while his dying mother called to him in vain could
thus preserve his presence of mind entered his own apartments whilst
Rodin busied himself with the answers he had been ordered to write and
transcribed them in cipher

In about three quarters of an hour the bells of the posthorses were
heard jingling without The old servant again entered after discreetly
knocking at the door and said

The carriage is ready

Rodin nodded and the servant withdrew The secretary in his turn went
to knock at the door of the inner room His master appeared still grave
and cold but fearfully pale and holding a letter in his hand

This for my mother said he to Rodin you will send a courier on the
instant

On the instant replied the secretary

Let the three letters for Leipsic Batavia and Charlestown leave
today by the ordinary channel They are of the last importance You
know it

Those were his last words Executing merciless orders with a merciless
obedience he departed without even attempting to see his mother His
secretary accompanied him respectfully to his carriage

What road sir asked the postilion turning round on his saddle

The road to ITALY answered Rodins master with so deep a sigh that
it almost resembled a sob

As the horses started at full gallop Rodin made a low bow then he
returned to the large cold bare apartment The attitude countenance
and gait of this personage seemed to have undergone a sudden change He
appeared to have increased in dimensions He was no longer an automaton
moved by the mechanism of humble obedience His features till now
impassible his glance hitherto subdued became suddenly animated with
an expression of diabolical craft a sardonic smile curled his thin
pale lips and a look of grim satisfaction relaxed his cadaverous face

In turn he stopped before the huge globe In turn he contemplated
it in silence even as his master had done Then bending over it and
embracing it as it were in his arms he gloated with his reptileeye
on it for some moments drew his coarse finger along its polished
surface and tapped his flat dirty nail on three of the places dotted
with red crosses And whilst he thus pointed to three towns in very
different parts of the world he named them aloud with a sneer

LeipsicCharlestownBatavia

In each of these three places he added distant as they are from one
another there exist persons who little think that here in this
obscure street from the recesses of this chamber wakeful eyes are
upon themthat all their movements are followed all their actions
knownand that hence will issue new instructions which deeply concern
them and which will be inexorably executed for an interest is at
stake which may have a powerful influence on Europeon the world
Luckily we have friends at Leipsic Charlestown and Batavia

This funny old sordid illdressed man with his livid and deathlike
countenance thus crawling over the sphere before him appeared still
more awful than his master when the latter erect and haughty had
imperiously laid his hand upon that globe which he seemed desirous of
subjecting by the strength of his pride and courage The one resembled
the eagle that hovers above his preythe other the reptile that
envelops its victim in its inextricable folds

After some minutes Rodin approached his desk rubbing his hands briskly
together and wrote the following epistle in a cipher unknown even to
his master

Paris 34 past 9 AM

He is gonebut he hesitated

When he received the order his dying mother had just summoned him
to her He might they told him save her by his presence and he
exclaimed Not to go to my mother would be matricide

Still he is gonebut he hesitated I keep my eye upon him
continually These lines will reach Rome at the same time as himself

PSTell the CardinalPrince that he may rely on me but I hope for
his active aid in return

When he had folded and sealed this letter Rodin put it into his pocket
The clock struck ten M Rodins hour for breakfast He arranged and
locked up his papers in a drawer of which he carried away the key
brushed his old greasy hat with his sleeve took a patched umbrella in
his hand and went out 1

Whilst these two men in the depths of their obscure retreat were thus
framing a plot which was to involve the seven descendants of a race
formerly proscribeda strange mysterious defender was planning how to
protect this family which was also his own

1 Having cited the excellent courageous letters of M Libri and the
curious work edited by M Paulin it is our duty likewise to mention
many bold and conscientious writings on the subject of the Society of
Jesus recently published by the elder Dupin Michelet Quinet Genin
and the Count de Saint Priestworks of high and impartial intellects
in which the fatal theories of the order are admirably exposed and
condemned We esteem ourselves happy if we can bring one stone towards
the erection of the strong and we hope durable embankment which these
generous hearts and noble minds are raising against the encroachments of
an impure and always menacing floodE S

INTERVAL

THE WANDERING JEWS SENTENCE

The site is wild and rugged It is a lofty eminence covered with huge
boulders of sandstone between which rise birch trees and oaks their
foliage already yellowed by autumn These tall trees stand out from the
background of red light which the sun has left in the west resembling
the reflection of a great fire

From this eminence the eye looks down into a deep valley shady
fertile and halfveiled in light vapor by the evening mist The rich
meadows the tufts of bushy trees the fields from which the ripe corn
has been gathered in all blend together in one dark uniform tint
which contrasts with the limpid azure of the heavens Steeples of gray
stone or slate lift their pointed spires at intervals from the midst
of this valley for many villages are spread about it bordering a
highroad which leads from the north to the west

It is the hour of reposethe hour when for the most part every
cottage window brightens to the joyous crackling of the rustic hearth
and shines afar through shade and foliage whilst clouds of smoke issue
from the chimneys and curl up slowly towards the sky But now strange
to say every hearth in the country seems cold and deserted Stranger
and more fatal still every steeple rings out a funeral knell Whatever
there is of activity movement or life appears concentrated in that
lugubrious and farsounding vibration

Lights begin to show themselves in the dark villages but they rise not
from the cheerful and pleasant rustic hearth They are as red as the
fires of the herdsmen seen at night through the midst of the fog And
then these lights do not remain motionless They creep slowly towards
the churchyard of every village Louder sounds the deathknell the air
trembles beneath the strokes of so many bells and at rare intervals
the funeral chant rises faintly to the summit of the hill

Why so many interments What valley of desolation is this where the
peaceful songs which follow the hard labors of the day are replaced by
the death dirge where the repose of evening is exchanged for the repose
of eternity What is this valley of the shadow where every village
mourns for its many dead and buries them at the same hour of the same
night

Alas the deaths are so sudden and numerous and frightful that there is
hardly time to bury the dead During day the survivors are chained to
the earth by hard but necessary toil and only in the evening when they
return from the fields are they able though sinking with fatigue to
dig those other furrows in which their brethren are to lie heaped like
grains of corn

And this valley is not the only one that has seen the desolation During
a series of fatal years many villages many towns many cities many
great countries have seen like this valley their hearths deserted and
coldhave seen like this valley mourning take the place of joy and
the deathknell substituted for the noise of festivalhave wept in
the same day for their many dead and buried them at night by the lurid
glare of torches

For during those fatal years an awful wayfarer had slowly journeyed
over the earth from one pole to the otherfrom the depths of India and
Asia to the ice of Siberiafrom the ice of Siberia to the borders of
the seas of France

This traveller mysterious as death slow as eternity implacable as
fate terrible as the hand of heaven was the CHOLERA

The tolling of bells and the funeral chants still rose from the depths
of the valley to the summit of the hill like the complaining of a
mighty voice the glare of the funeral torches was still seen afar
through the mist of evening it was the hour of twilightthat strange
hour which gives to the most solid forms a vague indefinite fantastic
appearancewhen the sound of firm and regular footsteps was heard on
the stony soil of the rising ground and between the black trunks of
the trees a man passed slowly onward

His figure was tall his head was bowed upon his breast his countenance
was noble gentle and sad his eyebrows uniting in the midst extended
from one temple to the other like a fatal mark on his forehead

This man did not seem to hear the distant tolling of so many funeral
bellsand yet a few days before repose and happiness health and joy
had reigned in those villages through which he had slowly passed and
which he now left behind him mourning and desolate But the traveller
continued on his way absorbed in his own reflections

The 13th of February approaches thought he the day approaches in
which the descendants of my beloved sister the last scions of our race
should meet in Paris Alas it is now a hundred and fifty years since
for the third time persecution scattered this family over all the
earththis family that I have watched over with tenderness for
eighteen centuries through all its migrations and exiles its changes
of religion fortune and name

Oh for this family descended from the sister of the poor
shoemaker2 what grandeur and what abasement what obscurity and what
splendor what misery and what glory By how many crimes has it been
sullied by how many virtues honored The history of this single family
is the history of the human race

Passing in the course of so many generations through the veins of the
poor and the rich of the sovereign and the bandit of the wise man and
the fool of the coward and the brave of the saint and the atheist the
blood of my sister has transmitted itself to this hour

What scions of this family are now remaining Seven only

Two orphans the daughters of proscribed parentsa dethroned princea
poor missionary priesta man of the middle classa young girl of a
great name and large fortunea mechanic

Together they comprise in themselves the virtues the courage the
degradation the splendor the miseries of our species

SiberiaIndiaAmericaFrancebehold the divers places where fate
has thrown them

My instinct teaches me when one of them is in peril Then from the
North to the South from the East to the West I go to seek them
Yesterday amid the polar froststoday in the temperate zonetomorrow
beneath the fires of the tropicsbut often alas at the moment when
my presence might save them the invisible hand impels me the whirlwind
carries me away and the voice speaks in my ear GO ON GO ON

Oh that I might only finish my taskGO ONA single houronly
a single hour of reposeGO ONAlas I leave those I love on the
brink of the abyssGO ON GO ON

Such is my punishment If it is great my crime was greater still An
artisan devoted to privations and misery my misfortunes had made me
cruel

Oh cursed cursed be the day when as I bent over my work sullen
with hate and despair because in spite of my incessant labor I and
mine wanted for everything the Saviour passed before my door

Reviled insulted covered with blows hardly able to sustain the
weight of his heavy cross He asked me to let Him rest a moment on my
stone bench The sweat poured from His forehead His feet were bleeding
He was wellnigh sinking with fatigue and He said to me in a mild
heart piercing voice I suffer And I too suffer I replied as with
harsh anger I pushed Him from the place I suffer and no one comes to
help me I find no pity and will give none Go on go on Then with
a deep sigh of pain He answered and spake this sentence Verily
thou shalt go on till the day of thy redemption for so wills the Father
which art in heaven

And so my punishment began Too late I opened these eyes to the light
too late I learned repentance and charity too late I understood those
divine words of Him I had outraged words which should be the law of the
whole human race LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER

In vain through successive ages gathering strength and eloquence from
those celestial words have I labored to earn my pardon by filling
with commiseration and love hearts that were overflowing with envy and
bitterness by inspiring many a soul with a sacred horror of oppression
and injustice For me the day of mercy has not yet dawned

And even as the first man by his fall devoted his posterity to
misfortune it would seem as if I the workman had consigned the whole
race of artisans to endless sorrows and as if they were expiating my
crime for they alone during these eighteen centuries have not yet
been delivered

For eighteen centuries the powerful and the happy of this world have
said to the toiling people what I said to the imploring and suffering
Saviour Go on go on And the people sinking with fatigue bearing
their heavy cross have answered in the bitterness of their grief
Oh for pitys sake a few moments of repose we are worn out with
toilGo onAnd if we perish in our pain what will become of
our little children and our aged mothersGo on go on And for
eighteen centuries they and I have continued to struggle forward and to
suffer and no charitable voice has yet pronounced the word Enough

Alas such is my punishment It is immense it is twofold I suffer
in the name of humanity when I see these wretched multitudes consigned
without respite to profitless and oppressive toil I suffer in the name
of my family when poor and wandering I am unable to bring aid to
the descendants of my dear sister But when the sorrow is above my
strength when I foresee some danger from which I cannot preserve my
own then my thoughts travelling over the world go in search of that
woman like me accursed that daughter of a queen who like me the
son of a laborer wanders and will wander on till the day of her
redemption3

Once in a century as two planets draw nigh to each other in their
revolutions I am permitted to meet this woman during the dread week of
the Passion And after this interview filled with terrible remembrances
and boundless griefs wandering stars of eternity we pursue our
infinite course

And this woman the only one upon earth who like me sees the end of
every century and exclaims What another this woman responds to my
thought from the furthest extremity of the world She who alone shares
my terrible destiny has chosen to share also the only interest that has
consoled me for so many ages Those descendants of my dear sister she
too loves she too protects them For them she journeys likewise from
East to West and from North to South

But alas the invisible hand impels her the whirlwind carries her
away and the voice speaks in her ear Go onOh that I might finish
my sentence repeats she alsoGo onA single houronly a single
hour of reposeGo onI leave those I love on the brink of the
abyssGo on Go on

Whilst this man thus went over the hill absorbed in his thoughts the
light evening breeze increased almost to a gale a vivid flash streamed
across the sky and long deep whistlings announced the coming of a
tempest

On a sudden this doomed man who could no longer weep or smile started
with a shudder No physical pain could reach him and yet he pressed his
hand hastily to his heart as though he had experienced a cruel pang
Oh cried he I feel it This hour many of those whom I lovethe
descendants of my dear sistersuffer and are in great peril Some in
the centre of Indiasome in Americasome here in Germany The struggle
recommences the detestable passions are again awake Oh thou that
hearest methou like myself wandering and accursedHerodias help
me to protect them May my invocation reach thee in those American
solitudes where thou now lingerestand may we arrive in time

Thereon an extraordinary event happened Night was come The man made
a movement precipitately to retrace his stepsbut an invisible force
prevented him and carried him forward in the opposite direction

At this moment the storm burst forth in its murky majesty One of those
whirlwinds which tear up trees by the roots and shake the foundations
of the rocks rushed over the hill rapid and loud as thunder

In the midst of the roaring of the hurricane by the glare of the fiery
flashes the man with the black mark on his brow was seen descending the
hill stalking with huge strides among the rocks and between trees bent
beneath the efforts of the storm

The tread of this man was no longer slow firm and steadybut
painfully irregular like that of one impelled by an irresistible power
or carried along by the whirl of a frightful wind In vain he extended
his supplicating hands to heaven Soon he disappeared in the shades of
night and amid the roar of the tempest

2 It is known that according to the legend the Wandering Jew was a
shoemaker at Jerusalem The Saviour carrying his cross passed before
the house of the artisan and asked him to be allowed to rest an instant
on the stone bench at his door Go on go on said the Jew harshly
pushing him away Thou shalt go on till the end of time answered the
Saviour in a stern though sorrowful tone For further details see
the eloquent and learned notice by Charles Magnin appended to the
magnificent poem Ahasuerus by Ed QuinetE S

3 According to a legend very little known for we are indebted to
the kindness of M Maury the learned sublibrarian of the Institute
Herodias was condemned to wander till the day of judgement for having
asked for the death of John the BaptistE S




CHAPTER XVII THE AJOUPA

While Rodin despatched his cosmopolite correspondence from his retreat
in the Rue du Milieu des Ursins in Pariswhile the daughters of
General Simon after quitting as fugitives the White Falcon were
detained prisoners at Leipsic along with Dagobertother scenes deeply
interesting to these different personages were passing almost as it
were at the same moment at the other extremity of the world in the
furthermost parts of Asiathat is to say in the island of Java not
far from the city of Batavia the residence of M Joshua Van Dael one
of the correspondents of Rodin

Java magnificent and fatal country where the most admirable flowers
conceal hideous reptiles where the brightest fruits contain subtle
poisons where grow splendid trees whose very shadow is deathwhere
the gigantic vampire bat sucks the blood of its victims whilst it
prolongs their sleep by surrounding them with a fresh and balmy air no
fan moving so rapidly as the great perfumed wings of this monster

The month of October 1831 draws near its close It is noonan hour
well nigh mortal to him who encounters the fiery heat of the sun which
spreads a sheet of dazzling light over the deep blue enamel of the sky

An ajoupa or hut made of cane mats suspended from long bamboos which
are driven far into the ground rises in the midst of the bluish shadows
cast by a tuft of trees whose glittering verdure resembles green
porcelain These quaintly formed trees rounded into arches pointing
like spires overspreading like parasols are so thick in foliage so
entangled one with the other that their dome is impenetrable to the
rain

The soil ever marshy notwithstanding the insupportable heat
disappears beneath an inextricable mass of creepers ferns and tufted
reeds of a freshness and vigor of vegetation almost incredible
reaching nearly to the top of the ajoupa which lies hid like a nest
among the grass

Nothing can be more suffocating than the atmosphere heavily laden with
moist exhalations like the steam of hot water and impregnated with
the strongest and sharpest scents for the cinnamontree gingerplant
stephanotis and Cape jasmine mixed with these trees and creepers
spread around in puffs their penetrating odors A roof formed of large
Indian figleaves covers the cabin at one end is a square opening
which serves for a window shut in with a fine latticework of vegetable
fibres so as to prevent the reptiles and venomous insects from creeping
into the ajoupa The huge trunk of a dead tree still standing but much
bent and with its summit reaching to the roof of the ajoupa rises from
the midst of the brushwood From every crevice in its black rugged
mossy bark springs a strange almost fantastic flower the wing of a
butterfly is not of a finer tissue of a more brilliant purple of a
more glossy black those unknown birds we see in our dreams have no
more grotesque forms than these specimens of the orchiswinged flowers
that seem always ready to fly from their frail and leafless stalks The
long flexible stems of the cactus which might be taken for reptiles
encircle also this trunk and clothe it with their bunches of silvery
white shaded inside with bright orange These flowers emit a strong
scent of vanilla

A serpent of a brickred about the thickness of a large quill and
five or six inches long half protrudes its flat head from one of those
enormous perfumed calyces in which it lies closely curled up

Within the ajoupa a young man is extended on a mat in a profound sleep
His complexion of a clear golden yellow gives him the appearance of a
statue of pale bronze on which a ray of sun is playing His attitude
is simple and graceful his right arm sustains his head a little raised
and turned on one side his ample robe of white muslin with hanging
sleeves leaves uncovered his chest and arms worthy of the Antoinous
Marble is not more firm more polished than his skin the golden hue of
which contracts strongly with the whiteness of his garments Upon his
broad manly chest a deep scar is visiblethe mark of the musketball he
received in defending the life of General Simon the father of Rose and
Blanche

Suspended from his neck he wears a medal similar to that in the
possession of the two sisters This Indian is Djalma

His features are at once very noble and very beautiful His hair of a
blue black parted upon his forehead falls waving but not curled over
his shoulders whilst his eyebrows boldly and yet delicately defined
are of as deep a jet as the long eyelashes that cast their shadow upon
his beardless cheek His bright red lips are slightly apart and he
breathes uneasily his sleep is heavy and troubled for the heat becomes
every moment more and more suffocating

Without the silence is profound Not a breath of air is stirring
Yet now the tall ferns which cover the soil begin to move almost
imperceptibly as though their stems were shaken by the slow progress
of some crawling body From time to time this trifling oscillation
suddenly ceases and all is again motionless But after several of
these alternations of rustling and deep silence a human head appears
in the midst of the jungle a little distance from the trunk of the dead
tree

The man to whom it belonged was possessed of a grim countenance with a
complexion the color of greenish bronze long black hair bound about his
temples eyes brilliant with savage fire and an expression remarkable
for its intelligence and ferocity Holding his breath he remained quite
still for a moment then advancing upon his hands and knees pushing
aside the leaves so gently that not the slightest noise could be heard
he arrived cautiously and slowly at the trunk of the dead tree the
summit of which nearly touched the roof of the ajoupa

This man of Malay origin belonging to the sect of the Lughardars
Stranglers after having again listened rose almost entirely from
amongst the brushwood With the exception of white cotton drawers
fastened around his middle by a particolored sash he was completely
naked His bronze supple and nervous limbs were overlaid with a
thick coat of oil Stretching himself along the huge trunk on the side
furthest from the cabin and thus sheltered by the whole breadth of the
tree with its surrounding creepers he began to climb silently with
as much patience as caution In the undulations of his form in the
flexibility of his movements in the restrained vigor which fully
put forth would have been alarming there was some resemblance to the
stealthy and treacherous advance of the tiger upon its prey

Having reached completely unperceived the inclined portion of the
tree which almost touched the roof of the cabin he was only separated
from the window by a distance of about a foot Cautiously advancing his
head he looked down into the interior to see how he might best find an
entrance

At sight of Djalma in his deep sleep the Thugs bright eyes glittered
with increased brilliancy a nervous contraction or rather a mute
ferocious laugh curling the corners of his mouth drew them up towards
the cheekbones and exposed rows of teeth filed sharp like the points
of a saw and dyed of a shining black

Djalma was lying in such a manner and so near the door of the ajoupa
which opened inwards that were it moved in the least he must be
instantly awakened The Strangler with his body still sheltered by the
tree wishing to examine more attentively the interior of the cabin
leaned very forward and in order to maintain his balance lightly
rested his hand on the ledge of the opening that served for a window
This movement shook the large cactusflowers within which the little
serpent lay curled and darting forth it twisted itself rapidly round
the wrist of the Strangler Whether from pain or surprise the man
uttered a low cry and as he drew back swiftly still holding by the
trunk of the tree he perceived that Djalma had moved

The young Indian though retaining his supine posture had half opened
his eyes and turned his head towards the window whilst his breast
heaved with a deepdrawn sigh for beneath that thick dome of moist
verdure the concentrated heat was intolerable

Hardly had he moved when from behind the tree was heard the shrill
brief sonorous note which the bird of paradise titters when it takes
its flighta cry which resembles that of the pheasant This note was
soon repeated but more faintly as though the brilliant bird were
already at a distance Djalma thinking he had discovered the cause of
the noise which had aroused him for an instant stretched out the arm
upon which his head had rested and went to sleep again with scarcely
any change of position

For some minutes the most profound silence once more reigned in this
solitude and everything remained motionless

The Strangler by his skillful imitation of the bird had repaired the
imprudence of that exclamation of surprise and pain which the reptile
bite had forced from him When he thought all was safe he again
advanced his head and saw the young Indian once more plunged in sleep
Then he descended the tree with the same precautions though his left
hand was somewhat swollen from the sting of the serpent and disappeared
in the jungle

At that instant a song of monotonous and melancholy cadence was heard
in the distance The Strangler raised himself and listened attentively
and his face took an expression of surprise and deadly anger The song
came nearer and nearer to the cabin and in a few seconds an Indian
passing through an open space in the jungle approached the spot where
the Thug lay concealed

The latter unwound from his waist a long thin cord to one of the ends
of which was attached a leaden ball of the form and size of an egg
having fastened the other end of this cord to his right wrist the
Strangler again listened and then disappeared crawling through the
tall grass in the direction of the Indian who still advanced slowly
without interrupting his soft and plaintive song

He was a young fellow scarcely twenty with a bronzed complexion the
slave of Djalma his vest of blue cotton was confined at the waist by a
particolored sash he wore a red turban and silver rings in his ears
and about his wrists He was bringing a message to his master who
during the great heat of the day was reposing in the ajoupa which stood
at some distance from the house he inhabited

Arriving at a place where two paths separated the slave without
hesitation took that which led to the cabin from which he was now
scarce forty paces distant

One of those enormous Java butterflies whose wings extend six or eight
inches in length and offer to the eye two streaks of gold on a ground
of ultramarine fluttering from leaf to leaf alighted on a bush of Cape
jasmine within the reach of the young Indian The slave stopped in his
song stood still advanced first a foot then a hand and seized the
butterfly

Suddenly he sees a dark figure rise before him he hears a whizzing
noise like that of a sling he feels a cord thrown with as much
rapidity as force encircle his neck with a triple band and almost in
the same instant the leaden ball strikes violently against the back of
his head

This attack was so abrupt and unforseen that Djalmas servant could not
even utter a single cry a single groan He totteredthe Strangler gave
a vigorous pull at the cordthe bronzed countenance of the slave became
purple and he fell upon his knees convulsively moving his arms Then
the Strangler threw him quite down and pulled the cord so violently
that the blood spurted from the skin The victim struggled for a
momentand all was over

During his short but intense agony the murderer kneeling before his
victim and watching with ardent eye his least convulsions seemed
plunged into an ecstasy of ferocious joy His nostrils dilated the
veins of his neck and temples were swollen and the same savage laugh
which had curled his lips at the aspect of the sleeping Djalma again
displayed his pointed black teeth which a nervous trembling of the jaws
made to chatter But soon he crossed his arms upon his heaving breast
bowed his forehead and murmured some mysterious words which sounded
like an invocation or a prayer Immediately after he returned to the
contemplation of the dead body The hyena and the tigercat who before
devouring crouch beside the prey that they have surprised or hunted
down have not a wilder or more sanguinary look than this man

But remembering that his task was not yet accomplished tearing himself
unwillingly from the hideous spectacle he unbound the cord from the
neck of his victim fastened it round his own body dragged the corpse
out of the path and without attempting to rob it of its silver rings
concealed it in a thick part of the jungle

Then the Strangler again began to creep on his knees and belly till he
arrived at the cabin of Djalmathat cabin constructed of mats suspended
from bamboos After listening attentively he drew from his girdle a
knife the sharppointed blade of which was wrapped in a figleaf and
made in the matting an incision of three feet in length This was done
with such quickness and with so fine a blade that the light touch of
the diamond cutting glass would have made more noise Seeing by means
of this opening which was to serve him for a passage that Djalma was
still fast asleep the Thug with incredible temerity glided into the
cabin




CHAPTER XVIII THE TATTOOING

The heavens which had been till now of transparent blue became
gradually of a greenish tint and the sun was veiled in red lurid
vapor This strange light gave to every object a weird appearance of
which one might form an idea by looking at a landscape through a piece
of copper colored glass In those climates this phenomenon when united
with an increase of burning heat always announces the approach of a
storm

From time to time there was a passing odor of sulphur then the leaves
slightly shaken by electric currents would tremble upon their stalks
till again all would return to the former motionless silence The weight
of the burning atmosphere saturated with sharp perfumes became almost
intolerable Large drops of sweat stood in pearls on the forehead of
Djalma still plunged in enervating sleepfor it no longer resembled
rest but a painful stupor

The Strangler glided like a reptile along the sides of the ajoupa and
crawling on his belly arrived at the sleepingmat of Djalma beside
which he squatted himself so as to occupy as little space as possible
Then began a fearful scene by reason of the mystery and silence which
surrounded it

Djalmas life was at the mercy of the Strangler The latter resting
upon his hands and knees with his neck stretched forward his eye fixed
and dilated continued motionless as a wild beast about to spring Only
a slight nervous trembling of the jaws agitated that mask of bronze

But soon his hideous features revealed a violent struggle that was
passing within hima struggle between the thirst the craving for the
enjoyment of murder which the recent assassination of the slave had
made still more active and the orders he had received not to attempt
the life of Djalma though the design which brought him to the ajoupa
might perhaps be as fatal to the young Indian as death itself Twice did
the Strangler with look of flame resting only on his left hand seize
with his right the ropes end and twice his hand fellthe instinct of
murder yielding to a powerful will of which the Malay acknowledged the
irresistible empire

In him the homicidal craving must have amounted to madness for in
these hesitations he lost much precious time at any moment Djalma
whose vigor skill and courage were known and feared might awake from
his sleep and though unarmed he would prove a terrible adversary At
length the Thug made up his mind with a suppressed sigh of regret he
set about accomplishing his task

This task would have appeared impossible to any one else The reader may
judge

Djalma with his face turned towards the left leaned his head upon his
curved arm It was first necessary without waking him to oblige him to
turn his face towards the right that is towards the door so that in
case of his being halfroused his first glance might not fall upon the
Strangler The latter to accomplish his projects would have to remain
many minutes in the cabin

The heavens became darker the heat arrived at its last degree of
intensity everything combined to increase the torpor of the sleeper
and so favor the Stranglers designs Kneeling down close to Djalma he
began with the tips of his supple welloiled fingers to stroke the
brow temples and eyelids of the young Indian but with such extreme
lightness that the contact of the two skins was hardly sensible When
this kind of magnetic incantation had lasted for some seconds the
sweat which bathed the forehead of Djalma became more abundant
he heaved a smothered sigh and the muscles of his face gave several
twitches for the strokings although too light to rouse him yet caused
in him a feeling of indefinable uneasiness

Watching him with his restless and burning eye the Strangler continued
his maneuvers with so much patience that Djalma still sleeping but
no longer able to bear this vague annoying sensation raised his right
hand mechanically to his face as if he would have brushed away an
importunate insect But he had not strength to do it almost immediately
after his hand inert and heavy fell back upon his chest The
Strangler saw by this symptom that he was attaining his object and
continued to stroke with the same address the eyelids brow and
temples

Whereupon Djalma more and more oppressed by heavy sleep and having
neither strength nor will to raise his hand to his face mechanically
turned round his head which fell languidly upon his right shoulder
seeking by this change of attitude to escape from the disagreeable
sensation which pursued him The first point gained the Strangler could
act more freely

To render as profound as possible the sleep he had half interrupted he
now strove to imitate the vampire and feigning the action of a fan
he rapidly moved his extended hands about the burning face of the young
Indian Alive to a feeling of such sudden and delicious coolness in the
height of suffocating heat the countenance of Djalma brightened his
bosom heaved his halfopened lips drank in the grateful air and he
fell into a sleep only the more invincible because it had been at first
disturbed and was now yielded to under the influence of a pleasing
sensation

A sudden flash of lightning illumined the shady dome that sheltered the
ajoupa fearing that the first clap of thunder might rouse the young
Indian the Strangler hastened to complete his Task Djalma lay on his
back with his head resting on his right shoulder and his left arm
extended the Thug crouching at his left side ceased by degrees the
process of fanning then with incredible dexterity he succeeded in
rolling up above the elbow the long wide sleeve of white muslin that
covered the left arm of the sleeper

He next drew from the pocket of his drawers a copper box from which he
took a very fine sharppointed needle and a piece of a blacklooking
root He pricked this root several times with the needle and on each
occasion there issued from it a white glutinous liquid

When the Strangler thought the needle sufficiently impregnated with this
juice he bent down and began to blow gently over the inner surface of
Djalmas arm so as to cause a fresh sensation of coolness then with
the point of his needle he traced almost imperceptibly on the skin of
the sleeping youth some mysterious and symbolical signs All this was
performed so cleverly and the point of the needle was so fine and keen
that Djalma did not feel the action of the acid upon the skin

The signs which the Strangler had traced soon appeared on the surface
at first in characters of a pale rosecolor as fine as a hair but
such was the slowly corrosive power of the juice that as it worked and
spread beneath the skin they would become in a few hours of a violet
red and as apparent as they were now almost invisible

The Strangler having so perfectly succeeded in his project threw a
last look of ferocious longing on the slumbering Indian and creeping
away from the mat regained the opening by which he had entered the
cabin next closely uniting the edges of the incision so as to obviate
all suspicion he disappeared just as the thunder began to rumble
hoarsely in the distance4

4 We read in the letters of the late Victor Jacquemont upon India
with regard to the incredible dexterity of these men They crawl on the
ground ditches in the furrows of fields imitate a hundred different
voices and dissipate the effect of any accidental noise by raising the
yelp of the jackal or note of some birdthen are silent and another
imitates the call of the same animal in the distance They can molest a
sleeper by all sorts of noises and slight touches and make his body
and limbs take any position which suits their purpose Count Edward
de Warren in his excellent work on English India which we shall have
again occasion to quote expresses himself in the same manner as to the
inconceivable address of the Indians They have the art says he to
rob you without interrupting your sleep of the very sheet in which
you are enveloped This is not a travellers tale but a fact The
movements of the bheel are those of the serpent If you sleep in your
tent with a servant lying across each entrance the bheel will come
and crouch on the outside in some shady corner where he can hear the
breathing of those within As soon as the European sleeps he feels
sure of success for the Asiatic will not long resist the attraction of
repose At the proper moment he makes a vertical incision in the cloth
of the tent on the spot where he happens to be and just large enough
to admit him He glides through like a phantom without making the least
grain of sand creak beneath his tread He is perfectly naked and all
his body is rubbed over with oil a twoedged knife is suspended from
his neck He will squat down close to your couch and with incredible
coolness and dexterity will gather up the sheet in very little folds
so as to occupy the least surface possible then passing to the other
side he will lightly tickle the sleeper whom he seems to magnetize
till the latter shrinks back involuntarily and ends by turning round
and leaving the sheet folded behind him Should he awake and strive to
seize the robber he catches at a slippery form which slides through
his hands like an eel should he even succeed in seizing him it would
be fatalthe dagger strikes him to the heart he falls bathed in his
blood and the assassin disappearsE S




CHAPTER XIX THE SMUGGLER

The tempest of the morning has long been over The sun is verging
towards the horizon Some hours have elapsed since the Strangler
introduced himself into Djalmas cabin and tattooed him with a
mysterious sign during his sleep

A horseman advances rapidly down a long avenue of spreading trees
Sheltered by the thick and verdant arch a thousand birds salute the
splendid evening with songs and circlings red and green parrots climb
by help of their hooked beaks to the top of pinkblossomed acacias
large Morea birds of the finest and richest blue whose throats and
long tails change in the light to a golden brown are chasing the prince
oriels clothed in their glossy feathers of black and orange Kolo
doves of a changeable violet hue are gently cooing by the side of the
birds of paradise in whose brilliant plumage are mingled the prismatic
colors of the emerald and ruby the topaz and sapphire

This avenue a little raised commanded a view of a small pond which
reflected at intervals the green shade of tamarind trees In the calm
limpid waters many fish were visible some with silver scales and
purple fins others gleaming with azure and vermilion so still were
they that they looked as if set in a mass of bluish crystal and as
they dwelt motionless near the surface of the pool on which played a
dazzling ray of the sun they revelled in the enjoyment of the light
and heat A thousand insectsliving gems with wings of flameglided
fluttered and buzzed over the transparent wave in which at an
extraordinary depth were mirrored the variegated tints of the aquatic
plants on the bank

It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the exuberant nature of
this scene luxuriant in the sunlight colors and perfumes which
served so to speak as a frame to the young and brilliant rider who
was advancing along the avenue It was Djalma He had not yet perceived
the indelible marks which the Strangler had traced upon his left arm

His Japanese mare of slender make full of fire and vigor is black
as night A narrow red cloth serves instead of saddle To moderate the
impetuous bounds of the animal Djalma uses a small steel bit with
headstall and reins of twisted scarlet silk fine as a thread

Not one of those admirable riders sculptured so masterly on the frieze
of the Parthenon sits his horse more gracefully and proudly than this
young Indian whose fine face illumined by the setting sun is radiant
with serene happiness his eyes sparkle with joy and his dilated
nostrils and unclosed lips inhale with delight the balmy breeze that
brings to him the perfume of flowers and the scent of fresh leaves for
the trees are still moist from the abundant rain that fell after the
storm

A red cap similar to that worn by the Greeks surmounting the
black locks of Djalma sets off to advantage the golden tint of his
complexion his throat is bare he is clad in his robe of white muslin
with large sleeves confined at the waist by a scarlet sash very full
drawers in white cotton stuff leave half uncovered his tawny and
polished legs their classic curve stands out from the dark sides of the
horse which he presses tightly between his muscular calves He has no
stirrups his foot small and narrow is shod with a sandal of morocco
leather

The rush of his thoughts by turns impetuous and restrained was
expressed in some degree by the pace he imparted to his horsenow bold
and precipitate like the flight of unbridled imaginationnow calm and
measured like the reflection which succeeds an idle dream But in
all this fantastic course his least movements were distinguished by a
proud independent and somewhat savage grace

Dispossessed of his paternal territory by the English and at first
detained by them as a stateprisoner after the death of his fatherwho
as M Joshua Van Dael had written to M Rodin had fallen sword in
handDjalma had at length been restored to liberty Abandoning the
continent of India and still accompanied by General Simon who had
lingered hard by the prison of his old friends son the young Indian
came next to Batavia the birthplace of his mother to collect the
modest inheritance of his maternal ancestors And amongst this property
so long despised or forgotten by his father he found some important
papers and a medal exactly similar to that worn by Rose and Blanche

General Simon was not more surprised than pleased at this discovery
which not only established a tie of kindred between his wife and
Djalmas mother but which also seemed to promise great advantages for
the future Leaving Djalma at Batavia to terminate some business there
he had gone to the neighboring island of Sumatra in the hope of finding
a vessel that would make the passage to Europe directly and rapidly
for it was now necessary that cost what it might the young Indian also
should be at Paris on the 13th February 1832 Should General Simon
find a vessel ready to sail for Europe he was to return immediately to
fetch Djalma and the latter expecting him daily was now going to the
pier of Batavia hoping to see the father of Rose and Blanche arrive by
the mail boat from Sumatra

A few words are here necessary on the early life of the son of Kadja
sing

Having lost his mother very young and brought up with rude simplicity
he had accompanied his father whilst yet a child to the great tiger
hunts as dangerous as battles and in the first dawn of youth he had
followed him to the stern bloody war which he waged in defence of his
country Thus living from the time of his mothers death in the
midst of forests and mountains and continual combats his vigorous and
ingenuous nature had preserved itself pure and he well merited the name
of The Generous bestowed on him Born a prince he waswhich by no
means followsa prince indeed During the period of his captivity
the silent dignity of his bearing had overawed his jailers Never a
reproach never a complainta proud and melancholy calm was all that
he opposed to a treatment as unjust as it was barbarous until he was
restored to freedom

Having thus been always accustomed to a patriarchal life or to a war of
mountaineers which he had only quitted to pass a few months in prison
Djalma knew nothing so to speak of civilized society Without its
exactly amounting to a defect he certainly carried his good qualities
to their extreme limits Obstinately faithful to his pledged word
devoted to the death confiding to blindness good almost to a complete
forgetfulness of himself he was inflexible towards ingratitude
falsehood or perfidy He would have felt no compunction to sacrifice
a traitor because could he himself have committed a treason he would
have thought it only just to expiate it with his life

He was in a word the man of natural feelings absolute and entire
Such a man brought into contact with the temperaments calculations
falsehoods deceptions tricks restrictions and hollowness of a
refined society such as Paris for example would without doubt
form a very curious subject for speculation We raise this hypothesis
because since his journey to France had been determined on Djalma had
one fixed ardent desireto be in Paris

In Paristhat enchanted cityof which even in Asia the land of
enchantment so many marvelous tales were told

What chiefly inflamed the fresh vivid imagination of the young Indian
was the thought of French womenthose attractive Parisian beauties
miracles of elegance and grace who eclipsed he was informed even the
magnificence of the capitals of the civilized world And at this very
moment in the brightness of that warm and splendid evening surrounded
by the intoxication of flowers and perfumes which accelerated the
pulses of his young fiery heart Djalma was dreaming of those exquisite
creatures whom his fancy loved to clothe in the most ideal garbs

It seemed to him as if at the end of the avenue in the midst of that
sheet of golden light which the trees encompassed with their full
green arch he could see pass and repass white and sylphlike a host
of adorable and voluptuous phantoms that threw him kisses from the tips
of their rosy fingers Unable to restrain his burning emotions carried
away by a strange enthusiasm Djalma uttered exclamations of joy deep
manly and sonorous and made his vigorous courser bound under him in
the excitement of a mad delight Just then a sunbeam piercing the dark
vault of the avenue shone full upon him

For several minutes a man had been advancing rapidly along a path
which at its termination intersected the avenue diagonally He stopped
a moment in the shade looking at Djalma with astonishment It was
indeed a charming sight to behold in the midst of a blaze of dazzling
lustre this youth so handsome joyous and ardent clad in his white
and flowing vestments gayly and lightly seated on his proud black mare
who covered her red bridle with her foam and whose long tail and thick
mane floated on the evening breeze

But with that reaction which takes place in all human desires Djalma
soon felt stealing over him a sentiment of soft undefinable melancholy
He raised his hand to his eyes now dimmed with moisture and allowed
the reins to fall on the mane of his docile steed which instantly
stopping stretched out its long neck and turned its head in the
direction of the personage whom it could see approaching through the
coppice

This man Mahal the Smuggler was dressed nearly like European sailors
He wore jacket and trousers of white duck a broad red sash and a
very lowcrowned straw hat His face was brown with stronglymarked
features and though forty years of age he was quite beardless

In another moment Mahal was close to the young Indian You are Prince
Djalma said he in not very good French raising his hand respectfully
to his hat

What would you said the Indian

You are the son of Kadjasing

Once again what would you

The friend of General Simon

General Simon cried Djalma

You are going to meet him as you have gone every evening since you
expect his return from Sumatra

Yes but how do you know all this said the Indian looking at the
Smuggler with as much surprise as curiosity

Is he not to land at Batavia today or tomorrow

Are you sent by him

Perhaps said Mahal with a distrustful air But are you really the
son of Kadjasing

Yes I tell youbut where have you seen General Simon

If you are the son of Kadjasing resumed Mahal continuing to regard
Djalma with a suspicious eye what is your surname

My sire was called the Father of the Generous answered the young
Indian as a shade of sorrow passed over his fine countenance

These words appeared in part to convince Mahal of the identity of
Djalma but wishing doubtless to be still more certain he resumed
You must have received two days ago a letter from General Simon
written from Sumatra

Yes but why so many questions

To assure myself that you are really the son of Kadjasing and to
execute the orders I have received

From whom

From General Simon

But where is he

When I have proof that you are Prince Djalma I will tell you I was
informed that you would be mounted on a black mare with a red bridle
But

By the soul of my mother speak what you have to say

I will tell you allif you can tell me what was the printed paper
contained in the last letter that General Simon wrote you from Sumatra

It was a cutting from a French newspaper

Did it announce good or bad news for the general

Good newsfor it related that during his absence they had
acknowledged the last rank and title bestowed on him by the Emperor as
they had done for others of his brothers in arms exiled like him

You are indeed Prince Djalma said the Smuggler after a moments
reflection I may speak General Simon landed last night in Java but
on a desert part of the coast

On a desert part

Because he has to hide himself

Hide himself exclaimed Djalma in amazement why

That I dont know

But where is he asked Djalma growing pale with alarm

He is three leagues hencenear the seashorein the ruins of
Tchandi

Obliged to hide himself repeated Djalma and his countenance
expressed increasing surprise and anxiety

Without being certain I think it is because of a duel he fought in
Sumatra said the Smuggler mysteriously

A duelwith whom

I dont knowI am not at all certain on the subject But do you know
the ruins of Tchandi

Yes

The general expects you there that is what he ordered me to tell you

So you came with him from Sumatra

I was pilot of the little smuggling coaster that landed him in the
night on a lonely beach He knew that you went every day to the mole
to wait for him I was almost sure that I should meet you He gave me
details about the letter you received from him as a proof that he had
sent me If he could have found the means of writing he would have
written

But he did not tell you why he was obliged to hide himself

He told me nothing Certain words made me suspect what I told youa
duel

Knowing the mettle of General Simon Djalma thought the suspicions of
the Smuggler not unfounded After a moments silence he said to him
Can you undertake to lead home my horse My dwelling is without the
townthere in the midst of those treesby the side of the new mosque
In ascending the mountain of Tchandi my horse would be in my way I
shall go much faster on foot

I know where you live General Simon told me I should have gone there
if I had not met you Give me your horse

Djalma sprang lightly to the ground threw the bridle to Mahal unrolled
one end of his sash took out a silk purse and gave it to the Smuggler
saying You have been faithful and obedient Hereit is a triflebut
I have no more

Kadjasing was rightly called the Father of the Generous said
the Smuggler bowing with respect and gratitude He took the road to
Batavia leading Djalmas horse The young Indian on the contrary
plunged into the coppice and walking with great strides he directed
his course towards the mountain on which were the ruins of Tchandi
where he could not arrive before night




CHAPTER XX M JOSHUA VAN DAEL

M Joshua Van Dael a Dutch merchant and correspondent of M Rodin was
born at Batavia the capital of the island of Java his parents had sent
him to be educated at Pondicherry in a celebrated religious house long
established in that place and belonging to the Society of Jesus
It was there that he was initiated into the order as professor of the
three vows or lay member commonly called temporal coadjutor

Joshua was a man of probity that passed for stainless of strict
accuracy in business cold careful reserved and remarkably skillful
and sagacious his financial operations were almost always successful
for a protecting power gave him ever in time knowledge of events
which might advantageously influence his commercial transactions The
religious house of Pondicherry was interested in his affairs having
charged him with the exportation and exchange of the produce of its
large possessions in this colony

Speaking little hearing much never disputing polite in the
extremegiving seldom but with choice and purposeJoshua without
inspiring sympathy commanded generally that cold respect which is
always paid to the rigid moralist for instead of yielding to the
influence of lax and dissolute colonial manners he appeared to live
with great regularity and his exterior had something of austerity about
it which tended to overawe

The following scene took place at Batavia while Djalma was on his way
to the ruins of Tchandi in the hope of meeting General Simon

M Joshua had just retired into his cabinet in which were many shelves
filled with paper boxes and huge ledgers and cash boxes lying open upon
desks The only window of this apartment which was on the ground floor
looked out upon a narrow empty court and was protected externally by
strong iron bars instead of glass it was fitted with a Venetian blind
because of the extreme heat of the climate

M Joshua having placed upon his desk a taper in a glass globe looked
at the clock Halfpast nine said he Mahal ought soon to be here

Saying this he went out passing through an antechamber opened a
second thick door studded with nailheads in the Dutch fashion
cautiously entered the court so as not to be heard by the people in
the house and drew back the secret bolt of a gate six feet high
formidably garnished with iron spikes Leaving this gate unfastened he
regained his cabinet after he had successively and carefully closed the
two other doors behind him

M Joshua next seated himself at his desk and took from a drawer a long
letter or rather statement commenced some time before and continued
day by day It is superfluous to observe that the letter already
mentioned as addressed to M Rodin was anterior to the liberation of
Djalma and his arrival at Batavia

The present statement was also addressed to M Rodin and Van Dael thus
went on with it

Fearing the return of General Simon of which I had been informed by
intercepting his lettersI have already told you that I had succeeded
in being employed by him as his agent here having then read his
letters and sent them on as if untouched to Djalma I felt myself
obliged from the pressure of the circumstances to have recourse
to extreme measurestaking care always to preserve appearances and
rendering at the same time a signal service to humanity which last
reason chiefly decided me

A new danger imperiously commanded these measures The steamship
Ruyter came in yesterday and sails tomorrow in the course of the day
She is to make the voyage to Europe via the Arabian Gulf her passengers
will disembark at Suez cross the Isthmus and go on board another
vessel at Alexandria which will bring them to France This voyage as
rapid as it is direct will not take more than seven or eight weeks We
are now at the end of October Prince Djalma might then be in France
by the commencement of the month of January and according to your
instructions of which I know not the motive but which I execute with
zeal and submission his departure must be prevented at all hazards
because you tell me some of the gravest interests of the Society would
be compromised by the arrival of this young Indian in Paris before the
13th of February Now if I succeed as I hope in making him miss this
opportunity of the Ruyter it will be materially impossible for him to
arrive in France before the month of April for the Ruyter is the only
vessel which makes the direct passage the others taking at least four
or five months to reach Europe

Before telling you the means which I have thought right to employ
to detain Prince Djalmaof the success of which means I am yet
uncertainit is well that you should be acquainted with the following
facts

They have just discovered in British India a community whose members
call themselves Brothers of the Good Work or Phansegars which
signifies simply Thugs or Stranglers these murderers do not shed
blood but strangle their victims less for the purpose of robbing
them than in obedience to a homicidal vocation and to the laws of an
infernal divinity named by them Bowanee

I cannot better give you an idea of this horrible sect than by
transcribing here some lines from the introduction of a report
by Colonel Sleeman who has hunted out this dark association with
indefatigable zeal The report in question was published about two
months ago Here is the extract it is the colonel who speaks

From 1822 to 1824 when I was charged with the magistracy and civil
administration of the district of Nersingpore not a murder not the
least robbery was committed by an ordinary criminal without my being
immediately informed of it but if any one had come and told me at this
period that a band of hereditary assassins by profession lived in the
village of Kundelie within about four hundred yards of my court of
justicethat the beautiful groves of the village of Mundesoor within
a days march of my residence formed one of the most frightful marts of
assassination in all Indiathat numerous bands of Brothers of the Good
Work coming from Hindostan and the Deccan met annually beneath these
shades as at a solemn festival to exercise their dreadful vocation
upon all the roads which cross each other in this localityI should
have taken such a person for a madman or one who had been imposed upon
by idle tales And yet nothing could be truer hundreds of travellers
had been buried every year in the groves of Mundesoor a whole tribe
of assassins lived close to my door at the very time I was supreme
magistrate of the province and extended their devastations to the
cities of Poonah and Hyderabad I shall never forget when to convince
me of the fact one of the chiefs of the Stranglers who had turned
informer against them caused thirteen bodies to be dug up from the
ground beneath my tent and offered to produce any number from the soil
in the immediate vicinity5

These few words of Colonel Sleeman will give some idea of this dread
society which has its laws duties customs opposed to all other
laws human and divine Devoted to each other even to heroism
blindly obedient to their chiefs who profess themselves the immediate
representatives of their dark divinity regarding as enemies all who do
not belong to them gaining recruits everywhere by a frightful system of
proselytisingthese apostles of a religion of murder go preaching their
abominable doctrines in the shade and spreading their immense net over
the whole of India

Three of their principal chiefs and one of their adepts flying from
the determined pursuit of the English governorgeneral having succeeded
in making their escape had arrived at the Straits of Malacca at no
great distance from our island a smuggler who is also something of a
pirate attached to their association and by name Mahal took them on
board his coasting vessel and brought them hither where they think
themselves for some time in safetyas following the advice of the
smuggler they lie concealed in a thick forest in which are many ruined
temples and numerous subterranean retreats

Amongst these chiefs all three remarkably intelligent there is one
in particular named Faringhea whose extraordinary energy and eminent
qualities make him every way redoubtable He is of the mixed race
half white and Hindoo has long inhabited towns in which are European
factories and speaks English and French very well The other two chiefs
are a Negro and a Hindoo the adept is a Malay

The smuggler Mahal considering that he could obtain a large reward
by giving up these three chiefs and their adept came to me knowing as
all the world knows my intimate relations with a person who has great
influence with our governor Two days ago he offered me on certain
conditions to deliver up the Negro the halfcaste the Hindoo and
the Malay These conditions area considerable sum of money and a free
passage on board a vessel sailing for Europe or America in order to
escape the implacable vengeance of the Thugs

I joyfully seized the occasion to hand over three such murderers to
human justice and I promised Mahal to arrange matters for him with the
governor but also on certain conditions innocent in themselves and
which concerned Djalma Should my project succeed I will explain myself
more at length I shall soon know the result for I expect Mahal every
minute

But before I close these despatches which are to go tomorrow by the
Ruyterin which vessel I have also engaged a passage for Mahal the
Smuggler in the event of the success of my plansI must include in
parentheses a subject of some importance

In my last letter in which I announced to you the death of Djalmas
father and his own imprisonment by the English I asked for
some information as to the solvency of Baron Tripeaud banker and
manufacturer at Paris who has also an agency at Calcutta This
information will now be useless if what I have just learned should
unfortunately turn out to be correct and it will be for you to act
according to circumstances

This house at Calcutta owes considerable sums both to me and our
colleague at Pondicherry and it is said that M Tripeaud has involved
himself to a dangerous extent in attempting to ruin by opposition a
very flourishing establishment founded some time ago by M Francois
Hardy an eminent manufacturer I am assured that M Tripeaud has
already sunk and lost a large capital in this enterprise he has no
doubt done a great deal of harm to M Francois Hardy but he has also
they say seriously compromised his own fortuneand were he to fail
the effects of his disaster would be very fatal to us seeing that he
owes a large sum of money to me and to us

In this state of things it would be very desirable if by the
employment of the powerful means of every kind at our disposal we could
completely discredit and break down the house of M Francois Hardy
already shaken by M Tripeauds violent opposition In that case the
latter would soon regain all he has lost the ruin of his rival would
insure his prosperity and our demands would be securely covered

Doubtless it is painful it is sad to be obliged to have recourse to
these extreme measures only to get back our own but in these days
are we not surely justified in sometimes using the arms that are
incessantly turned against us If we are reduced to such steps by the
injustice and wickedness of men we may console ourselves with the
reflection that we only seek to preserve our worldly possessions in
order to devote them to the greater glory of God whilst in the hands
of our enemies those very goods are the dangerous instruments of
perdition and scandal

After all it is merely a humble proposition that I submit to you Were
it in my power to take an active part in the matter I should do nothing
of myself My will is not my own It belongs with all I possess to
those whom I have sworn absolute obedience

Here a slight noise interrupted M Joshua and drew his attention from
his work He rose abruptly and went straight to the window Three
gentle taps were given on the outside of one of the slats of the blind

Is it you Mahal asked M Joshua in a low voice

It is I was answered from without also in a low tone

And the Malay

He has succeeded

Really cried M Joshua with an expression of great satisfaction
are you sure of it

Quite sure there is no devil more clever and intrepid

And Djalma

The parts of the letter which I quoted convinced him that I came from
General Simon and that he would find him at the ruins of Tchandi

Therefore at this moment

Djalma goes to the ruins where he will encounter the black the half
blood and the Indian It is there they have appointed to meet the
Malay who tattooed the prince during his sleep

Have you been to examine the subterraneous passage

I went there yesterday One of the stones of the pedestal of the statue
turns upon itself the stairs are large it will do

And the three chiefs have no suspicion

NoneI saw them in the morningand this evening the Malay came to
tell me all before he went to join them at the ruins of Tchandifor
he had remained hidden amongst the bushes not daring to go there in the
daytime

Mahalif you have told the truth and if all succeedyour pardon and
ample reward are assured to you Your berth has been taken on board the
Ruyter you will sail tomorrow you will thus be safe from the malice
of the Stranglers who would follow you hither to revenge the death of
their chiefs Providence having chosen you to deliver those three great
criminals to justice Heaven will bless youGo and wait for me at the
door of the governors house I will introduce you The matter is so
important that I do not hesitate to disturb him thus late in the night
Go quicklyI will follow on my side

The steps of Mahal were distinctly audible as he withdrew
precipitately and then silence reigned once more in the house Joshua
returned to his desk and hastily added these words to the despatch
which he had before commenced

Whatever may now happen it will be impossible for Djalma to leave
Batavia at present You may rest quite satisfied he will not be at
Paris by the 13th of next February As I foresaw I shall have to be up
all nightI am just going to the governors Tomorrow I will add
a few lines to this long statement which the steamship Ruyter will
convey to Europe

Having locked up his papers Joshua rang the bell loudly and to the
great astonishment of his servants not accustomed to see him leave home
in the middle of the night went in all haste to the residence of the
governor of the island

We now conduct the reader to the ruins of Tchandi

work British India in 1831E S




CHAPTER XXI THE RUINS OF TCHANDI To the storm in the middle of the
day the approach of which so well served the Stranglers designs upon
Djalma has succeeded a calm and serene night The disk of the moon
rises slowly behind a mass of lofty ruins situated on a hill in the
midst of a thick wood about three leagues from Batavia

Long ranges of stone high walls of brick fretted away by time
porticoes covered with parasitical vegetation stand out boldly from the
sheet of silver light which blends the horizon with the limpid blue of
the heavens Some rays of the moon gliding through the opening on one
of these porticoes fall upon two colossal statues at the foot of
an immense staircase the loose stones of which are almost entirely
concealed by grass moss and brambles

The fragments of one of these statues broken in the middle lie
strewed upon the ground the other which remains whole and standing is
frightful to behold It represents a man of gigantic proportions with
a head three feet high the expression of the countenance is ferocious
eyes of brilliant slaty black are set beneath gray brows the large
deep mouth gapes immoderately and reptiles have made their nest between
the lips of stone by the light of the moon a hideous swarm is
there dimly visible A broad girdle adorned with symbolic ornaments
encircles the body of this statue and fastens a long sword to its right
side The giant has four extended arms and in his great hands he
bears an elephants head a twisted serpent a human skull and a bird
resembling a heron The moon shedding her light on the profile of this
statue serves to augment the weirdness of its aspect

Here and there enclosed in the halfcrumbling walls of brick are
fragments of stone basreliefs very boldly cut one of those in the
best preservation represents a man with the head of an elephant and the
wings of a bat devouring a child Nothing can be more gloomy than these
ruins buried among thick trees of a dark green covered with frightful
emblems and seen by the moonlight in the midst of the deep silence of
night

Against one of the walls of this ancient temple dedicated to some
mysterious and bloody Javanese divinity leans a kind of hut rudely
constructed of fragments of brick and stone the door made of woven
rushes is open and a red light streams from it which throws its rays
on the tall grass that covers the ground Three men are assembled in
this hovel around a claylamp with a wick of cocoanut fibre steeped in
palmoil

The first of these three about forty years of age is poorly clad in
the European fashion his pale almost white complexion announces
that he belongs to the mixed race being offspring of a white father and
Indian mother

The second is a robust African negro with thick lips vigorous
shoulders and lank legs his woolly hair is beginning to turn gray
he is covered with rags and stands close beside the Indian The third
personage is asleep and stretched on a mat in the corner of the hovel

These three men are the three Thuggee chiefs who obliged to fly from
the continent of India have taken refuge in Java under the guidance of
Mahal the Smuggler

The Malay does not return said the halfblood named Faringhea the
most redoubtable chief of this homicidal sect in executing our orders
he has perhaps been killed by Djalma

The storm of this morning brought every reptile out of the earth said
the negro the Malay must have been bitten and his body ere now a nest
of serpents

To serve the good work proceeded Faringhea with a gloomy air one
must know how to brave death

And to inflict it added the negro

A stifled cry followed by some inarticulate words here drew the
attention of these two men who hastily turned their heads in the
direction of the sleeper This latter was thirty years old at most His
beardless face of a bright copper color his robe of coarse stuff his
turban striped brown and yellow showed that he belonged to the pure
Hindoo race His sleep appeared agitated by some painful vision an
abundant sweat streamed over his countenance contracted by terror he
spoke in his dream but his words were brief and broken and accompanied
with convulsive starts

Again that dream said Faringhea to the negro Always the remembrance
of that man

What man

Do you not remember how five years ago that savage Colonel Kennedy
butcher of the Indians came to the banks of the Ganges to hunt the
tiger with twenty horses four elephants and fifty servants

Yes yes said the negro and we three hunters of men made a better
days sport than he did Kennedy his horses his elephants and his
numerous servants did not get their tigerbut we got ours he added
with grim irony Yes Kennedy that tiger with a human face fell into
our ambush and the brothers of the good work offered up their fine prey
to our goddess Bowanee

If you remember it was just at the moment when we gave the last tug to
the cord round Kennedys neck that we perceived on a sudden a traveller
close at hand He had seen us and it was necessary to make away with
him Now since that time added Faringhea the remembrance of the
murder of that man pursues our brother in his dreams and he pointed to
the sleeping Indian

And even when he is awake said the negro looking at Faringhea with a
significant air

Listen said the other again pointing to the Indian who in the
agitation of his dream recommenced talking in abrupt sentences
listen he is repeating the answers of the traveller when we told
him he must die or serve with us on Thuggee His mind is still
impresseddeeply impressedwith those words

And in fact the Indian repeated aloud in his sleep a sort of
mysterious dialogue of which he himself supplied both questions and
answers

Traveller said he in a voice broken by sudden pauses why that
black mark on your forehead stretching from one temple to the other It
is a mark of doom and your look is sad as death Have you been a victim
Come with us Kallee will avenge you You have sufferedYes I
have greatly sufferedFor a long timeYes for a very long
timeYou suffer even nowYes even nowWhat do you reserve
for those who injure youMy pityWill you not render blow for
blowI will return love for hateWho are you then that render
good for evilI am one who loves and suffers and forgives

Brother do you hear said the negro to Faringhea he has not
forgotten the words of the traveller before his death

The vision follows him Listen he will speak again How pale he is
Still under the influence of his dream the Indian continued

Traveller we are three we are brave we have your life in our
handsyou have seen us sacrifice to the good work Be one of us or
diediedie Oh that look Not thusdo not look at me thus As he
uttered these last words the Indian made a sudden movement as if to
keep off some approaching object and awoke with a start Then passing
his hand over his moist forehead he looked round him with a bewildered
eye

What again this dream brother said Faringhea For a bold hunter of
men you have a weak head Luckily you have a strong heart and arm

The other remained a moment silent his face buried in his hands then
he replied It is long since I last dreamed of that traveller

Is he not dead said Faringhea shrugging his shoulders Did you not
yourself throw the cord around his neck

Yes replied the Indian shuddering

Did we not dig his grave by the side of Colonel Kennedys Did we not
bury him with the English butcher under the sand and the rushes said
the negro

Yes we dug his grave said the Indian trembling and yet only a
year ago I was seated one evening at the gate of Bombay waiting for
one of our brothersthe sun was setting behind the pagoda to the right
of the little hillthe scene is all before me nowI was seated under a
figtreewhen I heard a slow firm even step and as I turned round my
headI saw himcoming out of the town

A vision said the negro always the same vision

A vision added Faringhea or a vague resemblance

I knew him by the black mark on his forehead it was none but he
I remained motionless with fear gazing at him with eyes aghast He
stopped bending upon me his calm sad look In spite of myself I
could not help exclaiming It is heYes he replied in his gentle
voice it is I Since all whom thou killest must needs live again and
he pointed to heaven as he spoke why shouldst thou killHear me I
have just come from Java I am going to the other end of the world to a
country of nevermelting snow but here or there on plains of fire or
plains of ice I shall still be the same Even so is it with the souls
of those who fall beneath thy kalleepra in this world or up above in
this garb or in another the soul must still be a soul thou canst not
smite it Why then killand shaking his head sorrowfully he went on
his way walking slowly with downcast eyes he ascended the hill of
the pagoda I watched him as he went without being able to move at the
moment the sun set he was standing on the summit of the hill his tall
figure thrown out against the skyand so he disappeared Oh it was
he added the Indian with a shudder after a long pause it was none
but he

In this story the Indian had never varied though he had often
entertained his companions with the same mysterious adventure This
persistency on his part had the effect of shaking their incredulity or
at least of inducing them to seek some natural cause for this apparently
superhuman event

Perhaps said Faringhea after a moments reflection the knot round
the travellers neck got jammed and some breath was left him the air
may have penetrated the rushes with which we covered his grave and so
life have returned to him

No no said the Indian shaking his head this man is not of our
race

Explain

Now I know it

What do you know

Listen said the Indian in a solemn voice the number of victims
that the children of Bowanee have sacrificed since the commencement of
ages is nothing compared to the immense heap of dead and dying whom
this terrible traveller leaves behind him in his murderous march

He cried the negro and Faringhea

Yes he repeated the Hindoo with a convinced accent that made its
impression upon his companions Hear me and trembleWhen I met this
traveller at the gates of Bombay he came from Java and was going
towards the north he said The very next day the town was a prey to
the cholera and we learned sometime after that this plague had first
broken out here in Java

That is true said the negro

Hear me still further resumed the other I am going towards the
north to a country of eternal snow said the traveller to me
The cholera also went towards the north passing through
MuscatIspahanTaurisTiflistill it overwhelmed Siberia

True said Faringhea becoming thoughtful

And the cholera resumed the Indian only travelled its five or six
leagues a daya mans trampnever appeared in two places at oncebut
swept on slowly steadilyeven as a man proceeds

At the mention of this strange coincidence the Hindoos companions
looked at each other in amazement After a silence of some minutes
the awestruck negro said to the last speaker So you think that this
man

I think that this man whom we killed restored to life by some
infernal divinity has been commissioned to bear this terrible scourge
over the earth and to scatter round his steps that death from which he
is himself secure Remember added the Indian with gloomy enthusiasm
this awful wayfarer passed through Javathe cholera wasted Java He
passed through Bombaythe cholera wasted Bombay He went towards the
norththe cholera wasted the north

So saying the Indian fell into a profound reverie The negro and
Faringhea were seized with gloomy astonishment

The Indian spoke the truth as to the mysterious march still
unexplained of that fearful malady which has never been known to
travel more than five or six leagues a day or to appear simultaneously
in two spots Nothing can be more curious than to trace out on the
maps prepared at the period in question the slow progressive course of
this travelling pestilence which offers to the astonished eye all the
capricious incidents of a tourists journey Passing this way rather
than thatselecting provinces in a countrytowns in a provinceone
quarter in a townone street in a quarterone house in a
streethaving its place of residence and repose and then continuing
its slow mysterious fear inspiring march

The words of the Hindoo by drawing attention to these dreadful
eccentricities made a strong impression upon the minds of the negro and
Faringheawild natures brought by horrible doctrines to the monomania
of murder

Yesfor this also is an established factthere have been in India
members of an abominable community who killed without motive without
passionkilled for the sake of killingfor the pleasure of murderto
substitute death for lifeto make of a living man a corpse as they
have themselves declared in one of their examinations

The mind loses itself in the attempt to penetrate the causes of these
monstrous phenomena By what incredible series of events have men been
induced to devote themselves to this priesthood of destruction Without
doubt such a religion could only flourish in countries given up like
India to the most atrocious slavery and to the most merciless iniquity
of man to man

Such a creedis it not the hate of exasperated humanity wound up to
its highest pitch by oppressionMay not this homicidal sect whose
origin is lost in the night of ages have been perpetuated in these
regions as the only possible protest of slavery against despotism May
not an inscrutable wisdom have here made Phansegars even as are made
tigers and serpents

What is most remarkable in this awful sect is the mysterious bond
which uniting its members amongst themselves separates them from all
other men They have laws and customs of their own they support and
help each other but for them there is neither country nor family they
owe no allegiance save to a dark invisible power whose decrees they
obey with blind submission and in whose name they spread themselves
abroad to make corpses according to their own savage expression6

For some moments the three Stranglers had maintained a profound silence

Outside the hut the moon continued to throw great masses of white
radiance and tall bluish shadows over the imposing fabric of the
ruins the stars sparkled in the heavens from time to time a faint
breeze rustled through the thick and varnished leaves of the bananas and
the palms

The pedestal of the gigantic statue which still entire stood on the
left side of the portico rested upon large flagstones half hidden with
brambles Suddenly one of these stones appeared to fall in and from
the aperture which thus formed itself without noise a man dressed
in uniform half protruded his body looked carefully around him and
listened

Seeing the rays of the lamp which lighted the interior of the hovel
tremble upon the tall grass he turned round to make a signal and
soon accompanied by two other soldiers he ascended with the greatest
silence and precaution the last steps of the subterranean staircase
and went gliding amongst the ruins For a few moments their moving
shadows were thrown upon the moonlit ground then they disappeared
behind some fragments of broken wall

At the instant when the large stone resumed its place and level the
heads of many other soldiers might have been seen lying close in the
excavation The halfcaste the Indian and the negro still seated
thoughtfully in the hut did not perceive what was passing

6 The following are some passages from the Count de Warrens very
curious book British India in 1831 Besides the robbers who kill
for the sake of the booty they hope to find upon travellers there is a
class of assassins forming an organized society with chiefs of their
own a slanglanguage a science a freemasonry and even a religion
which has its fanaticism and its devotion its agents emissaries
allies its militant forces and its passive adherents who contribute
their money to the good work This is the community of the Thugs or
Phansegars deceivers or stranglers from thugna to deceive and
phansna to strangle a religious and economical society which
speculates with the human race by exterminating men its origin is lost
in the night of ages

Until 1810 their existence was unknown not only to the European
conquerors but even to the native governments Between the years 1816
and 1830 several of their bands were taken in the act and punished
but until this last epoch all the revelations made on the subject by
officers of great experience had appeared too monstrous to obtain the
attention or belief of the public they had been rejected and despised
as the dreams of a heated imagination And yet for many years at the
very least for half a century this social wound had been frightfully
on the increase devouring the population from the Himalayas to Cape
Comorin and from Cutch to Assam

It was in the year 1830 that the revelations of a celebrated chief
whose life was spared on condition of his denouncing his accomplices
laid bare the whole system The basis of the Thuggee Society is a
religious beliefthe worship of Bowanee a gloomy divinity who is only
pleased with carnage and detests above all things the human race Her
most agreeable sacrifices are human victims and the more of these
her disciple may have offered up in this world the more he will be
recompensed in the next by all the delights of soul and sense by women
always beautiful and joys eternally renewed If the assassin meets the
scaffold in his career he dies with the enthusiasm of a martyr because
he expects his reward To obey his divine mistress he murders without
anger and without remorse the old man woman and child whilst to his
fellowreligionists he may be charitable humane generous devoted
and may share all in common with them because like himself they are
the ministers and adopted children of Bowanee The destruction of his
fellowcreatures not belonging to his communitythe diminution of the
human racethat is the primary object of his pursuit it is not as a
means of gain for though plunder may be a frequent and doubtless an
agreeable accessory it is only secondary in his estimation Destruction
is his end his celestial mission his calling it is also a delicious
passion the most captivating of all sportsthis hunting of menYou
find great pleasure said one of those that were condemned in
tracking the wild beast to his den in attacking the boar the tiger
because there is danger to brave energy and courage to display Think
how this attraction must be redoubled when the contest is with man
when it is man that is to be destroyed Instead of the single faculty
of courage all must be called into actioncourage cunning foresight
eloquence intrigue What springs to put in motion what plans to
develop To sport with all the passions to touch the chords of love
and friendship and so draw the prey into ones netthat is a glorious
chaseit is a delight a rapture I tell you

Whoever was in India in the years 1831 and 1832 must remember the
stupor and affright which the discovery of this vast infernal machine
spread through all classes of society A great number of magistrates and
administrators of provinces refused to believe in it and could not be
brought to comprehend that such a system had so long preyed on the body
politic under their eyes as it were silently and without betraying
itselfSee British India in 183 by Count Edward de Warren 2 vols

CHAPTER XXII THE AMBUSCADE

The halfblood Faringhea wishing doubtless to escape from the dark
thoughts which the words of the Indian on the mysterious course of
the Cholera had raised within him abruptly changed the subject of
conversation His eye shone with lurid fire and his countenance took an
expression of savage enthusiasm as he cried Bowanee will always watch
over us intrepid hunters of men Courage brothers courage The world
is large our prey is everywhere The English may force us to quit
India three chiefs of the good workbut what matter We leave there
our brethren secret numerous and terrible as black scorpions whose
presence is only known by their mortal sting Exiles will widen our
domains Brother you shall have America said he to the Hindoo with
an inspired air Brother you shall have Africa said he to the negro
Brothers I will take Europe Wherever men are to be found there must
be oppressors and victimswherever there are victims there must be
hearts swollen with hateit is for us to inflame that hate with all the
ardor of vengeance It is for us servants of Bowanee to draw towards
us by seducing wiles all whose zeal courage and audacity may be
useful to the cause Let us rival each other in devotion and sacrifices
let us lend each other strength help support That all who are not
with us may be our prey let us stand alone in the midst of all against
all and in spite of all For us there must be neither country nor
family Our family is composed of our brethren our country is the
world

This kind of savage eloquence made a deep impression on the negro
and the Indian over whom Faringhea generally exercised considerable
influence his intellectual powers being very superior to theirs though
they were themselves two of the most eminent chiefs of this bloody
association Yes you are right brother cried the Indian sharing
the enthusiasm of Faringhea the world is ours Even here in Java let
us leave some trace of our passage Before we depart let us establish
the good work in this island it will increase quickly for here also
is great misery and the Dutch are rapacious as the English Brother
I have seen in the marshy ricefields of this island always fatal to
those who cultivate them men whom absolute want forced to the deadly
taskthey were livid as corpsessome of them worn out with sickness
fatigue and hunger fellnever to rise again Brothers the good work
will prosper in this country

The other evening said the halfcaste I was on the banks of the
lake behind a rock a young woman came therea few rags hardly covered
her lean and sunscorched bodyin her arms she held a little child
which she pressed weeping to her milkless breast She kissed it three
times and said to it You at least shall not be so unhappy as
your fatherand she threw it into the lake It uttered one wail and
disappeared On this cry the alligators hidden amongst the reeds
leaped joyfully into the water There are mothers here who kill their
children out of pityBrothers the good work will prosper in this
country

This morning said the negro whilst they tore the flesh of one of
his black slaves with whips a withered old merchant of Batavia left
his countryhouse to come to the town Lolling in his palanquin he
received with languid indolence the sad caresses of two of those
girls whom he had bought to people his harem from parents too poor to
give them food The palanquin which held this little old man and the
girls was carried by twelve young and robust men There are here you
see mothers who in their misery sell their own daughtersslaves
that are scourgedmen that carry other men like beasts of
burdenBrothers the good work will prosper in this country

Yes in this countryand in every land of oppression distress
corruption and slavery

Could we but induce Djalma to join us as Mahal the Smuggler advised
said the Indian our voyage to Java would doubly profit us for we
should then number among our band this brave and enterprising youth who
has so many motives to hate mankind

He will soon be here let us envenom his resentments

Remind him of his fathers death

Of the massacre of his people

His own captivity

Only let hatred inflame his heart and he will be ours

The negro who had remained for some time lost in thought said
suddenly Brothers suppose Mahal the Smuggler were to betray us

He cried the Hindoo almost with indignation he gave us an asylum on
board his bark he secured our flight from the Continent he is again
to take us with him to Bombay where we shall find vessels for America
Europe Africa

What interest would Mahal have to betray us said Faringhea Nothing
could save him from the vengeance of the sons of Bowanee and that he
knows

Well said the black he promised to get Djalma to come hither this
evening and once amongst us he must needs be our own

Was it not the Smuggler who told us to order the Malay to enter the
ajoupa of Djalma to surprise him during his sleep and instead of
killing him as he might have done to trace the name of Bowanee upon his
arm Djalma will thus learn to judge of the resolution the cunning and
obedience of our brethren and he will understand what he has to hope or
fear from such men Be it through admiration or through terror he must
become one of us

But if he refuses to join us notwithstanding the reasons he has to
hate mankind

ThenBowanee will decide his fate said Faringhea with a gloomy
look I have my plan

But will the Malay succeed in surprising Djalma during his sleep said
the negro

There is none nobler more agile more dexterous than the Malay
said Faringhea He once had the daring to surprise in her den a black
panther as she suckled her cub He killed the dam and took away the
young one which he afterwards sold to some European ships captain

The Malay has succeeded exclaimed the Indian listening to a singular
kind of hoot which sounded through the profound silence of the night
and of the woods

Yes it is the scream of the vulture seizing its prey said the negro
listening in his turn it is also the signal of our brethren after
they have seized their prey

In a few minutes the Malay appeared at the door of the hut He had
wound around him a broad length of cotton adorned with bright colored
stripes

Well said the negro anxiously have you succeeded

Djalma must bear all his life the mark of the good work said the
Malay proudly To reach him I was forced to offer up to Bowanee a man
who crossed my pathI have left his body under the brambles near the
ajoupa But Djalma is marked with the sign Mahal the Smuggler was the
first to know it

And Djalma did not awake said the Indian confounded by the Malays
adroitness

Had he awoke replied the other calmly I should have been a dead
manas I was charged to spare his life

Because his life may be more useful to us than his death said the
halfcaste Then addressing the Malay he added Brother in risking
life for the good work you have done today what we did yesterday
what we may do again tomorrow This time you obey another you will
command

We all belong to Bowanee answered the Malay What is there yet to
doI am ready Whilst he thus spoke his face was turned towards the
door of the hut on a sudden he said in a low voice Here is Djalma
He approaches the cabin Mahal has not deceived us

He must not see me yet said Faringhea retiring to an obscure corner
of the cabin and hiding himself under a mat try to persuade him If
he resistsI have my project

Hardly had Faringhea disappeared saying these words when Djalma
arrived at the door of the hovel At sight of those three personages
with their forbidding aspect Djalma started in surprise But ignorant
that these men belonged to the Phansegars and knowing that in a
country where there are no inns travellers often pass the night under
a tent or beneath the shelter of some ruins he continued to advance
towards them After the first moment he perceived by the complexion and
the dress of one of these men that he was an Indian and he accosted
him in the Hindoo language I thought to have found here a Europeana
Frenchman

The Frenchman is not yet come replied the Indian but he will not be
long

Guessing by Djalmas question the means which Mahal had employed to
draw him into the snare the Indian hoped to gain time by prolonging his
error

You knew this Frenchman asked Djalma of the Phansegar

He appointed us to meet here as he did you answered the Indian

For what inquired Djalma more and more astonished

You will know when he arrives

General Simon told you to be at this place

Yes General Simon replied the Indian

There was a moments pause during which Djalma sought in vain to
explain to himself this mysterious adventure And who are you asked
he with a look of suspicion for the gloomy silence of the Phansegars
two companions who stared fixedly at each other began to give him some
uneasiness

We are yours if you will be ours answered the Indian

I have no need of younor you of me

Who knows

I know it

You are deceived The English killed your father a king made you a
captive proscribed you you have lost all your possessions

At this cruel reminder the countenance of Djalma darkened He started
and a bitter smile curled his lip The Phansegar continued

Your father was just and bravebeloved by his subjectsthey called
him Father of the Generous and he was well named Will you leave his
death unavenged Will the hate which gnaws at your heart be without
fruit

My father died with arms in his hand I revenged his death on the
English whom I killed in war He who has since been a father to me and
who fought also in the same cause told me that it would now be madness
to attempt to recover my territory from the English When they gave me
my liberty I swore never again to set foot in Indiaand I keep the
oaths I make

Those who despoiled you who took you captive who killed your
fatherwere men Are there not other men on whom you can avenge
yourself Let your hate fall upon them

You who speak thus of men are not a man

I and those who resemble me are more than men We are to the rest of
the human race what the bold hunter is to the wild beasts which they
run down in the forest Will you be like us more than a man Will you
glut surely largely safelythe hate which devours your heart for all
the evil done you

Your words become more and more obscure I have no hatred in my heart
said Djalma When an enemy is worthy of me I fight with him when he
is unworthy I despise him So that I have no hateeither for brave men
or cowards

Treachery cried the negro on a sudden pointing with rapid gesture to
the door for Djalma and the Indian had now withdrawn a little from it
and were standing in one corner of the hovel

At the shout of the negro Faringhea who had not been perceived by
Djalma threw off abruptly the mat which covered him drew his crease
started up like a tiger and with one bound was out of the cabin Then
seeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle he dealt one
of them a mortal stroke threw down two others and disappeared in
the midst of the ruins All this passed so instantaneously that when
Djalma turned round to ascertain the cause of the negros cry of alarm
Faringhea had already disappeared

The muskets of several soldiers crowding to the door were immediately
pointed at Djalma and the three Stranglers whilst others went in
pursuit of Faringhea The negro the Malay and the Indian seeing the
impossibility of resistance exchanged a few rapid words and offered
their hands to the cords with which some of the soldiers had provided
themselves

The Dutch captain who commanded the squad entered the cabin at this
moment And this other one said he pointing out Djalma to the
soldiers who were occupied in binding the three Phansegars

Each in his turn captain said an old sergeant We come to him
next

Djalma had remained petrified with surprise not understanding what
was passing round him but when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers
approach with ropes to bind him he repulsed them with violent
indignation and rushed towards the door where stood the officer The
soldiers who had supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the
same impassibility as his companions were astounded by this resistance
and recoiled some paces being struck in spite of themselves with the
noble and dignified air of the son of Kadjasing

Why would you bind me like these men cried Djalma addressing himself
in Hindostanee to the officer who understood that language from his
long service in the Dutch colonies

Why would we bind you wretchbecause you form part of this band of
assassins What added the officer in Dutch speaking to the soldiers
are you afraid of himTie the cord tight about his wrists there will
soon be another about his neck

You are mistaken said Djalma with a dignity and calmness which
astonished the officer I have hardly been in this place a quarter of
an hourI do not know these men I came here to meet a Frenchman

Not a Phansegar like themWho will believe the falsehood

Them cried Djalma with so natural a movement and expression of
horror that with a sign the officer stopped the soldiers who were
again advancing to bind the son of Kadjasing these men form part
of that horrible band of murderers and you accuse me of being their
accompliceOh in this case sir I am perfectly at ease said the
young man with a smile of disdain

It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil replied the
officer thanks to their confessions we now know by what mysterious
signs to recognize the Thugs

I repeat sir that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror and
that I came here

The negro interrupting Djalma said to the officer with a ferocious
joy You have hit it the sons of the good work do know each other by
marks tattooed on their skin For us the hour has comewe give our
necks to the cord Often enough have we twined it round the necks of
those who served not with us the good work Now look at our arms and
look at the arms of this youth

The officer misinterpreting the words of the negro said to Djalma It
is quite clear that if as this negro tells us you do not bear on
your arm the mysterious symbolwe are going to assure ourselves of
the fact and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory
manner you may be at liberty within two hours

You do not understand me said the negro to the officer Prince
Djalma is one of us for he bears on his left arm the name of Bowanee

Yes he is like us a son of Kale added the Malay

He is like us a Phansegar said the Indian

The three men irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on
learning that they were Phansegars took a savage pride in making
it believed that the son of Kadjasing belonged to their frightful
association

What have you to answer said the officer to Djalma The latter again
gave a look of disdainful pity raised with his right hand his long
wide left sleeve and displayed his naked arm

What audacity cried the officer for on the inner part of the fore
arm a little below the bend the name of the Bowanee in bright red
Hindoo characters was distinctly visible The officer ran to the Malay
and uncovered his arm he saw the same word the same signs Not
yet satisfied he assured himself that the negro and the Indian were
likewise so marked

Wretch cried he turning furiously towards Djalma you inspire even
more horror than your accomplices Bind him like a cowardly assassin
added he to the soldiers like a cowardly assassin who lies upon the
brink of the grave for his execution will not be long delayed

Struck with stupor Djalma who for some moments had kept his eye
riveted on the fatal mark was unable to pronounce a word or make the
least movement his powers of thought seemed to fail him in presence of
this incomprehensible fact

Would you dare deny this sign said the officer to him with
indignation

I cannot deny what I seewhat is said Djalma quite overcome

It is lucky that you confess at last replied the officer Soldiers
keep watch over him and his accomplicesyou answer for them

Almost believing himself the sport of some wild dream Djalma offered no
resistance but allowed himself to be bound and removed with mechanical
passiveness The officer with part of his soldiers hoped still to
discover Faringhea amongst the ruins but his search was vain and
after spending an hour in fruitless endeavors he set out for Batavia
where the escort of the prisoners had arrived before him

Some hours after these events M Joshua van Dael thus finished his long
despatch addressed to M Rodin of Paris

Circumstances were such that I could not act otherwise and taking
all into consideration it is a very small evil for a great good Three
murderers are delivered over to justice and the temporary arrest of
Djalma will only serve to make his innocence shine forth with redoubled
luster

Already this morning I went to the governor to protest in favor of our
young prince As it was through me I said that those three great
criminals fell into the hands of the authorities let them at least
show me some gratitude by doing everything to render clear as day the
innocence of Prince Djalma so interesting by reason of his misfortunes
and noble qualities Most certainly I added when I came yesterday to
inform the governor that the Phansegars would be found assembled in
the ruins of Tchandi I was far from anticipating that any one would
confound with those wretches the adopted son of General Simon an
excellent man with whom I have had for some time the most honorable
relations We must then at any cost discover the inconceivable
mystery that has placed Djalma in this dangerous position and I
continued so convinced am I of his innocence that for his own sake
I would not ask for any favor on his behalf He will have sufficient
courage and dignity to wait patiently in prison for the day of justice
In all this you see I spoke nothing but the truth and had not to
reproach myself with the least deception for nobody in the world is
more convinced than I am of Djalmas innocence

The governor answered me as I expected that morally he felt as certain
as I did of the innocence of the young prince and would treat him with
all possible consideration but that it was necessary for justice to
have its course because it would be the only way of demonstrating
the falsehood of the accusation and discovering by what unaccountable
fatality that mysterious sign was tattooed upon Djalmas arm

Mahal the Smuggler who alone could enlighten justice on this subject
will in another hour have quitted Batavia to go on board the Ruyter
which will take him to Egypt for he has a note from me to the captain
to certify that he is the person for whom I engaged and paid the
passage At the same time he will be the bearer of this long despatch
for the Ruyter is to sail in an hour and the last letterbag for
Europe was made up yesterday evening But I wished to see the governor
this morning before closing the present

Thus then is Prince Djalma enforced detained for a month and this
opportunity of the Ruyter once lost it is materially impossible that
the young Indian can be in France by the 13th of next February You see
therefore that even as you ordered so have I acted according to the
means at my disposalconsidering only the end which justifies themfor
you tell me a great interest of the society is concerned

In your hands I have been what we all ought to be in the hands of our
superiorsa mere instrument since for the greater glory of God we
become corpses with regard to the will7 Men may deny our unity
and power and the times appear opposed to us but circumstances only
change we are ever the same

Obedience and courage secrecy and patience craft and audacity union
and devotionthese become us who have the world for our country our
brethren for family Rome for our Queen

 J V

About ten oclock in the morning Mahal the Smuggler set out with this
despatch sealed in his possession to board the Ruyter An hour
later the dead body of this same Mahal strangled by Thuggee lay
concealed beneath some reeds on the edge of a desert strand whither he
had gone to take boat to join the vessel

When at a subsequent period after the departure of the steamship
they found the corpse of the smuggler M Joshua sought in vain for the
voluminous packet which he had entrusted to his care Neither was there
any trace of the note which Mahal was to have delivered to the captain
of the Ruyter in order to be received as passenger

Finally the searches and bushwhacking ordered throughout the country
for the purpose of discovering Faringhea were of no avail The
dangerous chief of the Stranglers was never seen again in Java

the mainspring of the Society of Jesus is summed up in those terrible
words of the dying Loyola Every member of the Order shall be in the
hands of his superiors even as a corpse Perinde ac CadaverE S




CHAPTER XXIII M RODIN

Three months have elapsed since Djalma was thrown into Batavia Prison
accused of belonging to the murderous gang of Megpunnas The following
scene takes place in France at the commencement of the month of
February 1832 in Cardoville Manor House an old feudal habitation
standing upon the tall cliffs of Picardy not far from Saint Valery
a dangerous coast on which almost every year many ships are totally
wrecked being driven on shore by the northwesters which render the
navigation of the Channel so perilous

From the interior of the Castle is heard the howling of a violent
tempest which has arisen during the night a frequent formidable
noise like the discharge of artillery thunders in the distance and
is repeated by the echoes of the shore it is the sea breaking with fury
against the high rocks which are overlooked by the ancient Manor House

It is about seven oclock in the morning Daylight is not yet visible
through the windows of a large room situated on the groundfloor In
this apartment in which a lamp is burning a woman of about sixty years
of age with a simple and honest countenance dressed as a rich
farmers wife of Picardy is already occupied with her needlework
notwithstanding the early hour Close by the husband of this woman
about the same age as herself is seated at a large table sorting and
putting up in bags divers samples of wheat and oats The face of this
whitehaired man is intelligent and open announcing good sense
and honesty enlivened by a touch of rustic humor he wears a
shootingjacket of green cloth and long gaiters of tancolored leather
which half conceal his black velveteen breeches

The terrible storm which rages without renders still more agreeable
the picture of this peaceful interior A rousing fire burns in a broad
chimneyplace faced with white marble and throws its joyous light on
the carefully polished floor nothing can be more cheerful than the old
fashioned chintz hangings and curtains with red Chinese figures upon a
white ground and the panels over the door painted with pastoral scenes
in the style of Watteau A clock of Sevres china and rosewood furniture
inlaid with greenquaint and portly furniture twisted into all sorts
of grotesque shapescomplete the decorations of this apartment

Outdoors the gale continued to howl furiously and sometimes a gust
of wind would rush down the chimney or shake the fastenings of the
windows The man who was occupied in sorting the samples of grain was M
Dupont bailiff of Cardoville manor

Holy Virgin said his wife what dreadful weather my dear This
M Rodin who is to come here this morning as the Princess de Saint
Diziers steward announced to us picked out a very bad day for it

Why in truth I have rarely heard such a hurricane If M Rodin has
never seen the sea in its fury he may feast his eyes today with the
sight

What can it be that brings this M Rodin my dear

Faith I know nothing about it The steward tells me in his letter to
show M Rodin the greatest attention and to obey him as if he were my
master It will be for him to explain himself and for me to execute his
orders since he comes on the part of the princess

By rights he should come from Mademoiselle Adrienne as the land
belongs to her since the death of the duke her father

Yes but the princess being aunt to the young lady her steward manages
Mademoiselle Adriennes affairsso whether one or the other it amounts
to the same thing

May be M Rodin means to buy the estate Though to be sure that
stout lady who came from Paris last week on purpose to see the chateau
appeared to have a great wish for it

At these words the bailiff began to laugh with a sly look

What is there to laugh at Dupont asked his wife a very good
creature but not famous for intelligence or penetration

I laugh answered Dupont to think of the face and figure of that
enormous woman with such a look who the devil would call themselves
Madame de la SainteColombeMrs Holy Dove A pretty saint and a
pretty dove truly She is round as a hogshead with the voice of a
towncrier has gray moustachios like an old grenadier and without
her knowing it I heard her say to her servant Stir your stumps my
heartyand yet she calls herself SainteColombe

How hard on her you are Dupont a body dont choose ones name And
if she has a beard it is not the ladys fault

Nobut it is her fault to call herself SainteColombe Do you imagine
it her true name Ah my poor Catherine you are yet very green in some
things

While you my poor Dupont are well read in slander This lady seems
very respectable The first thing she asked for on arriving was the
chapel of the Castle of which she had heard speak She even said that
she would make some embellishments in it and when I told her we had
no church in this little place she appeared quite vexed not to have a
curate in the village

Oh to be sure thats the first thought of your upstartsto play the
great lady of the parish like your titled people

Madame de la SainteColombe need not play the great lady because she
is one

She a great lady Oh lor

Yesonly see how she was dressed in scarlet gown and violet gloves
like a bishops and when she took off her bonnet she had a diamond
band round her headdress of false light hair and diamond eardrops
as large as my thumb and diamond rings on every finger None of your
tuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the day

You are a pretty judge

That is not all

Do you mean to say theres more

She talked of nothing but dukes and marquises and counts and very
rich gentlemen who visit at her house and are her most intimate
friends and then when she saw the summer house in the park halfburnt
by the Prussians which our late master never rebuilt she asked What
are those ruins there and I answered Madame it was in the time of
the Allies that the pavilion was burntOh my clear cried she
our allies good dear allies they and the Restoration began my
fortune So you see Dupont I said to myself directly She was no
doubt one of the noble women who fled abroad

Madame de la SainteColombe cried the bailiff laughing heartily
Oh my poor poor wife

Oh it is all very well but because you have been three years at
Paris dont think yourself a conjurer

Catherine lets drop it you will make me say some folly and there
are certain things which dear good creatures like you need never know

I cannot tell what you are driving at only try to be less
slanderousfor after all should Madame de la SainteColombe buy the
estate will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff eh

Not Ifor we are getting old my good Catherine we have lived here
twenty years and we have been too honest to provide for our old days
by pilferingand truly at our age it would be hard to seek another
place which perhaps we should not find What I regret is that
Mademoiselle Adrienne should not keep the land it seems that she wished
to sell it against the will of the princess

Good gracious Dupont is it not very extraordinary that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so early in
life

Faith simple enough Our young lady having no father or mother is
mistress of her property besides having a famous little will of her
own Dost remember ten years ago when the count brought her down here
one summerwhat an imp of mischief and then what eyes ehhow they
sparkled even then

It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her lookan expressiona
very uncommon expression for her age

If she has kept what her witching luring face promised she must be
very pretty by this time notwithstanding the peculiar color of her
hairfor between ourselves if she had been a tradesmans daughter
instead of a young lady of high birth they would have called it red

There again more slander

What against Mademoiselle Adrienne Heaven forbidI always thought
that she would be as good as pretty and it is not speaking ill of her
to say she has red hair On the contrary it always appears to me so
fine so bright so sunny and to suit so well her snowy complexion and
black eyes that in truth I would not have had it other than it was
and I am sure that now this very color of her hair which would be
a blemish in any one else must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle
Adriennes face She must have such a sweet vixen look

Oh to be candid she really was a vixenalways running about the
park aggravating her governess climbing the treesin fact playing
all manner of naughty tricks

I grant you Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block but
then what wit what engaging ways and above all what a good heart

Yesthat she certainly had Once I remember she gave her shawl and
her new merino frock to a poor little beggar girl and came back to the
house in her petticoat and bare arms

Oh an excellent heartbut headstrongterribly headstrong

Yesthat she was and tis likely to finish badly for it seems that
she does things at Parisoh such things

What things

Oh my dear I can hardly venture

Fell but what are they

Why said the worthy dame with a sort of embarrassment and confusion
which showed how much she was shocked by such enormities they say
that Mademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church but lives in a
kind of heathen temple in her aunts garden where she has masked women
to dress her up like a goddess and scratches them very often because
she gets tipsywithout mentioning that every night she plays on a
hunting horn of massive goldall which causes the utmost grief and
despair to her poor aunt the princess

Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter which interrupted his
wife

Now tell me said he when this first access of hilarity was over
where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle Adrienne

From Renes wife who went to Paris to look for a child to nurse she
called at SaintDizier House to see Madame Grivois her godmotherNow
Madame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the princessand she it
was who told her all thisand surely she ought to know being in the
house

Yes a fine piece of goods that Grivois once she was a regular bad
un but now she professes to be as overnice as her mistress like
master like man they say The princess herself who is now so stiff and
starched knew how to carry on a lively game in her time Fifteen years
ago she was no such prude do you remember that handsome colonel of
hussars who was in garrison at Abbeville an exiled noble who had
served in Russia whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration

Yes yesI remember him but you are really too backbiting

Not a bitI only speak the truth The colonel spent his whole time
here and every one said he was very warm with this same princess who
is now such a saint Oh those were the jolly times Every evening some
new entertainment at the chateau What a fellow that colonel was to set
things going how well he could act a playI remember

The bailiff was unable to proceed A stout maidservant wearing the
costume and cap of Picardy entered in haste and thus addressed her
mistress Madame there is a person here that wants to speak to master
he has come in the postmasters calash from SaintValery and he says
that he is M Rodin

M Rodin said the bailiff rising Show him in directly

A moment after M Rodin made his appearance According to his custom
he was dressed even more than plainly With an air of great humility
he saluted the bailiff and his wife and at a sign from her husband
the latter withdrew The cadaverous countenance of M Rodin his almost
invisible lips his little reptile eyes half concealed by their flabby
lids and the sordid style of his dress rendered his general aspect
far from prepossessing yet this man knew how when it was necessary
to affect with diabolical art so much sincerity and goodnaturehis
words were so affectionate and subtly penetratingthat the disagreeable
feeling of repugnance which the first sight of him generally inspired
wore off little by little and he almost always finished by involving
his dupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as pliant
as it was honeyed and perfidious for ugliness and evil have their
fascination as well as what is good and fair

The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise when he thought
of the pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint
Dizier he had expected to see quite another sort of personage and
hardly able to dissemble his astonishment he said to him Is it to M
Rodin that I have the honor to speak

Yes sir and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess
de SaintDizier

Pray sir draw near the fire whilst I just see what is in this
letter The weather is so bad continued the bailiff obligingly may
I not offer you some refreshment

A thousand thanks my dear sir I am off again in an hour

Whilst M Dupont read M Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
chamber like a man of skill and experience he had frequently drawn
just and useful inductions from those little appearances which
revealing a taste or habit give at the same time some notion of a
character on this occasion however his curiosity was at fault

Very good sir said the bailiff when he had finished reading the
steward renews his recommendation and tells me to attend implicitly to
your commands

Well sir they will amount to very little and I shall not trouble you
long

It will be no trouble but an honor

Nay I know how much your time must be occupied for as soon as one
enters this chateau one is struck with the good order and perfect
keeping of everything in itwhich proves my dear sir what excellent
care you take of it

Oh sir you flatter me

Flatter youa poor old man like myself has something else to think
of But to come to business there is a room here which is called the
Green Chamber

Yes sir the room which the late CountDuke de Cardoville used for a
study

You will have the goodness to take me there

Unfortunately it is not in my power to do so After the death of the
CountDuke and when the seals were removed a number of papers were
shut up in a cabinet in that room and the lawyers took the keys with
them to Paris

Here are those keys said M Rodin showing to the bailiff a large and
a small key tied together

Oh sir that is different You come to look for papers

Yesfor certain papersand also far a small mahogany casket with
silver claspsdo you happen to know it

Yes sir I have often seen it on the counts writingtable It must be
in the large lacquered cabinet of which you have the key

You will conduct me to this chamber as authorized by the Princess de
SaintDizier

Yes sir the princess continues in good health

Perfectly so She lives altogether above worldly things

And Mademoiselle Adrienne

Alas my dear sir said M Rodin with a sigh of deep contrition and
grief

Good heaven sir has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne

In what sense do you mean it

Is she ill

No noshe is unfortunately as well as she is beautiful

Unfortunately cried the bailiff in surprise

Alas yes for when beauty youth and health are joined to an evil
spirit of revolt and perversityto a character which certainly has not
its equal upon earthit would be far better to be deprived of those
dangerous advantages which only become so many causes of perdition But
I conjure you my dear sir let us talk of something else this subject
is too painful said M Rodin with a voice of deep emotion lifting
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye as if to
stop a rising tear

The bailiff did not see the tear but he saw the gesture and he was
struck with the change in M Rodins voice He answered him therefore
with much sympathy Pardon my indiscretion sir I really did not
know

It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feelingtears are so rare with old menbut if you had seen as I have
the despair of that excellent princess whose only fault has been too
much kindness too much weakness with regard to her nieceby which she
has encouraged herbut once more let us talk of something else my
dear sir

After a moments pause during which M Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion he said to Dupont One part of my mission my dear sirthat
which relates to the Green ChamberI have now told you but there
is yet another Before coming to it however I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgottennamely that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago the Marquis dAigrigny then colonel of the hussars
in garrison at Abbeville spent some time in this house

Oh sir what a dashing officer was there It was only just now that
I was talking about him to my wife He was the life of the househow
well he could perform playsparticularly the character of a scapegrace
In the Two Edmonds for instance he would make you die with laughing
in that part of a drunken soldierand then with what a charming voice
he sang Joconde sirbetter than they could sing it at Paris

Rodin having listened complacently to the bailiff said to him
You doubtless know that after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist one General Simon the Marquis dAigrigny whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be left the world for the church

No sir is it possible That fine officer

That fine officerbrave noble rich esteemed and
flatteredabandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown and
notwithstanding his name position high connections his reputation as
a great preacher he is still what he was fourteen years agoa plain
abbewhilst so many who have neither his merit nor his virtues are
archbishops and cardinals

M Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness with such an air of
conviction and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable
that M Dupont could not help exclaiming Well sir that is splendid
conduct

Splendid Oh no said M Rodin with an inimitable expression of
simplicity it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like
M dAigrignys But amongst all his good qualities he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy peoplepeople of integrity honor
conscienceand therefore my dear M Dupont he has not forgotten you

What the most noble marquis deigns to remember

Three days ago I received a letter from him in which he mentions your
name

Is he then at Paris

He will be there soon if not there now He went to Italy about three
months ago and during his absence he received a very sad piece of
newsthe death of his mother who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de SaintDizier

Oh indeed I was not aware of it

Yes it was a cruel grief to him but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence

And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name

I am going to tell you First of all you must know that this house
is sold The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris

Oh sir that renews all my uneasiness

Pray why

I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff

Now see what a lucky chance It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you

Is it possible

Certainly Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place and I will do all
in my power to serve you if

Ah sir cried Dupont interrupting Rodin what gratitude do I not
owe you It is Heaven that sends you to me

Now my dear sir you flatter me in your turn but I ought to tell you
that Im obliged to annex a small condition to my support

Oh by all means Only name it sirname it

The person who is about to inhabit this mansion is an old lady in
every way worthy of veneration Madame de la SainteColombe is the name
of this respectable

What sir said the bailiff interrupting Rodin Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out

Do you know her

Yes sir she came last week to see the estate My wife persists that
she is a great lady butbetween ourselvesjudging by certain words
that I heard her speak

You are full of penetration my dear M Dupont Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner under one of the wooden porticoes of the
Palais Royal You see that I deal openly with you

And she boasted of all the noblemen French and foreign who used to
visit her

No doubt they came to buy bonnets for their wives However the fact
is that having gained a large fortune and after being in youth and
middle ageindifferentalas more than indifferent to the salvation
of her soulMadame de la SainteColombe is now in a likely way
to experience gracewhich renders her as I told you worthy
of veneration because nothing is so respectable as a sincere
repentancealways providing it to be lasting Now to make the good work
sure and effectual we shall need your assistance my dear M Dupont

Mine sir what can I do in it

A great deal and I will explain to you how There is no church in this
village which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes
Madame de la SainteColombe wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont who have long
lived in these parts for information respecting them

Oh in that case the choice will soon be made The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men

Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe

How so

You must on the contrary much praise without ceasing the curate
of Roiville the other parish so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care

And why sir to him rather than to the other

Whybecause if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la SainteColombe to make the choice I wish you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff I give you my word of it and what I promise I
perform

I do not doubt sir that you have this power said Dupont convinced
by Rodins manner and the authority of his words but I should like to
know

One word more said Rodin interrupting him I will deal openly with
you and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue It is only for the purpose of doing a good action The
curate of Roiville for whom I ask your influence is a man for whom M
dAigrigny feels a deep interest Though very poor he has to support
an aged mother Now if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe he would do more good than any one else because he is full
of zeal and patience and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages by which his old mother might profitthere you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friends parish I wrote about
it to the marquis and he remembering you desired me to ask you
to render him this small service which as you see will not remain
without a recompense For I tell you once more and I will prove it
that I have the power to keep you in your place as bailiff

Well sir replied Dupont after a moments reflection you are so
frank and obliging that I will imitate your sincerity In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country the curate of Roiville whom you wish me to prefer to him is
dreaded for his intoleranceand moreover

Well and what more

Why then they say

Come what do they say

They sayhe is a Jesuit

Upon these words M Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazementfor the countenance of M Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed A Jesuit he repeated
with redoubled hilarity a JesuitNow really my dear M Dupont for
a man of sense experience and intelligence how can you believe such
idle storiesA Jesuitare there such people as Jesuitsin our time
above all can you believe such romance of the Jacobins hobgoblins of
the old freedom loversCome come I wager you have read about them
in the Constitutionnel

And yet sir they say

Good heavens what will they not sayBut wise men prudent men like
you do not meddle with what is saidthey manage their own little
matters without doing injury to any one and they never sacrifice for
the sake of nonsense a good place which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days I tell you frankly however much I
may regret it that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man you will not remain bailiff here

But sir said poor Dupont it will not be my fault if this lady
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate should prefer him to
your friend

Ah but if on the other hand persons who have long lived in the
neighborhoodpersons worthy of confidence whom she will see every
daytell Madame de la SainteColombe a great deal of good of my friend
and a great deal of harm of the other curate she will prefer the
former and you will continue bailiff

But sirthat would be calumny cried Dupont

Pshaw my dear M Dupont said Rodin with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counselI was only making a supposition You wish to remain bailiff
on this estate I offer you the certainty of doing soit is for you to
consider and decide

But sir

One word moreor rather one more conditionas important as the other
Unfortunately we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others I believe our protege incapable of any such basenessbut in
order to discharge my responsibilityand yours also as you will have
contributed to his appointmentI must request that you will write to me
twice a week giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character habits connections pursuits of Madame de la Sainte
Colombefor the influence of a confessor you see reveals itself in
the whole conduct of life and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend without his being aware of itor if anything
blameable were to strike you I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence

But sirthat would be to act as a spy exclaimed the unfortunate
bailiff

Now my dear M Dupont how can you thus brand the sweetest most
wholesome of human desiresmutual confidenceI ask of you nothing
elseI ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here On these two conditions inseparable one from the other
you remain bailiff otherwise I shall be forced with grief and regret
to recommend some one else to Madame de la SainteColombe

I beg you sir said Dupont with emotion Be generous without any
conditionsI and my wife have only this place to give us bread and we
are too old to find another Do not expose our probity of forty
years standing to be tempted by the fear of want which is so bad a
counsellor

My dear M Dupont you are really a great child you must reflect upon
this and give me your answer in the course of a week

Oh sir I implore you The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs What is that said M Rodin Hardly had he spoken when
the same noise was again heard more distinctly than before

It is the sound of cannon cried Dupont rising no doubt a ship in
distress or signaling for a pilot

My dear said the bailiffs wife entering abruptly from the terrace
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismastedthey are
drifting right upon the shorethe ship is firing minute gullsit will
be lost

Oh it is terrible cried the bailiff taking his hat and preparing to
go out to look on at a shipwreck and be able to do nothing

Can no help be given to these vessels asked M Rodin

If they are driven upon the reefs no human power can save them since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast

Lost with all on boardOh very frightful said M Rodin

In such a storm there is but little chance for the crew no matter
said the bailiff addressing his wife I will run down to the rocks
with the people of the farm and try to save some of them poor
creaturesLight large fires in several roomsget ready linen
clothes cordialsI scarcely dare hope to save any but we must do our
best Will you come with me M Rodin

I should think it a duty if I could be at all useful but I am too
old and feeble to be of any service said M Rodin who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber and when I have found the articles I require
I will set out immediately for Paris for I am in great haste

Very well sir Catherine will show you Ring the big bell said the
bailiff to his servant let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff with ropes and levers

Yes my dear replied Catherine but do not expose yourself

Kiss meit will bring me luck said the bailiff and he started at a
full run crying Quick quick by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels

My dear madam said Rodin always impassible will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber

Please to follow me sir answered Catherine drying her tearsfor
she trembled on account of her husband whose courage she well knew




CHAPTER XXIV THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging Mountainous waves of dark green marbled with white
foam stand out in high deep undulations from the broad streak of red
light which extends along the horizon Above are piled heavy masses
of black and sulphurous vapor whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray driven by the violence of the wind rush across the murky sky

The pale winter sun before he quite disappears in the great clouds
behind which he is slowly mounting casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves A band of snowwhite foam boils and rages as far
as the eye can reach along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast

Halfway up a rugged promontory which juts pretty far into the sea
rises Cardoville Castle a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors

A large disabled ship with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts drives dead upon the coast Now she rolls
her monstrous hull upon the wavesnow plunges into their trough A
flash is seen followed by a dull sound scarcely perceptible in
the midst of the roar of the tempest That gun is the last signal of
distress from this lost vessel which is fast forging on the breakers

At the same moment a steamer with its long plume of black smoke is
working her way from east to west making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore leaving the breakers on her left The dismasted
ship drifting towards the rocks at the mercy of the wind and tide
must some time pass right ahead of the steamer

Suddenly the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck in a second the chimney
was carried away the paddle box stove in one of the wheels rendered
useless A second whitecap following the first again struck the
vessel amidships and so increased the damage that no longer answering
to the helm she also drifted towards the shore in the same direction
as the ship But the latter though further from the breakers presented
a greater surface to the wind and sea and so gained upon the steamer
in swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminenta
new clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck

The ship was an English vessel the Black Eagle homeward bound from
Alexandria with passengers who arriving from India and Java via
the Red Sea had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez from on board
the steamship Ruyter The Black Eagle quitting the Straits of
Gibraltar had gone to touch at the Azores She headed thence for
Portsmouth when she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester
The steamer was the William Tell coming from Germany by way of the
Elbe and bound in the last place for Hamburg to Havre

These two vessels the sport of enormous rollers driven along by tide
and tempest were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed
The deck of each offered a terrible spectacle the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks at the foot of a perpendicular cliff

The captain of the Black Eagle standing on the poop holding by the
remnant of a spar issued his last orders in this fearful extremity
with courageous coolness The smaller boats had been carried away by
the waves it was in vain to think of launching the longboat the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a lifelinealmost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel

The deck was covered with passengers whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion Some struck with a kind of stupor and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility Others wrung their hands in despair or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations Here women knelt down to pray
there others hid their faces in their hands that they might not see
the awful approach of death A young mother pale as a specter holding
her child clasped tightly to her bosom went supplicating from sailor
to sailor and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son

These cries and tears and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes
waiting for the moment to make a last effort to dispute their lives
with the fury of the waves others renouncing all hope prepared to meet
death with stoical indifference

Here and there touching or awful episodes rose in relief if one may so
express it from this dark and gloomy background of despair

A young man of about eighteen or twenty with shiny black hair copper
colored complexion and perfectly regular and handsome features
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils wrapped in a
cloak he leaned his back against the bulwarks with his feet resting
against one of the bulkheads Suddenly the unhappy mother who with
her child in her arms and gold in her hand had in vain addressed
herself to several of the mariners to beg them to save her boy
perceiving the young man with the coppercolored complexion threw
herself on her knees before him and lifted her child towards him with
a burst of inexpressible agony The young man took it mournfully shook
his head and pointed to the furious wavesbut with a meaning gesture
he appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it Then the
young mother in a mad transport of hope seized the hand of the youth
and bathed it with her tears

Further on another passenger of the Black Eagle seemed animated
by sentiments of the most active pity One would hardly have given him
fiveandtwenty years of age His long fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance He wore a black cassock and
white neckband Applying himself to comfort the most desponding he
went from one to the other and spoke to them pious words of hope and
resignation to hear him console some and encourage others in language
full of unction tenderness and ineffable charity one would have
supposed him unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared

On his fine mild features was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought from time to
time he raised to heaven his large blue eyes beaming with gratitude
love and serenity as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren and if not able to rescue them at all
at least die with them pointing to the sky One might almost have
taken him for an angel sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate

Strange contrast not far from this young mans angelic beauty there
was another being who resembled an evil spirit

Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck A grim wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow that tint peculiar to those who spring
from the union of the white race with the East He wore only a shirt and
linen drawers from his neck was suspended by a cord a cylindrical tin
box similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence

The more the danger augmented the nearer the ship came to the
breakers or to a collision with the steamer which she was now rapidly
approachinga terrible collision which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocksthe more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports He
seemed to long with ferocious impatience for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony the terror and the despair of those around
him one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities who in barbarous countries preside over murder and carnage

By this time the Black Eagle driven by the wind and waves came so
near the William Tell that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the firstnamed vessel

These passengers were no longer numerous The heavy sea which stove
in the paddlebox and broke one of the paddles had also carried away
nearly the whole of the bulwarks on that side the waves entering
every instant by this large opening swept the decks with irresistible
violence and every time bore away with them some fresh victims

Amongst the passengers who seemed only to have escaped this danger
to be hurled against the rocks or crushed in the encounter of the two
vessels one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful
interest Taking refuge abaft a tall old man with bald forehead and
gray moustache had lashed himself to a stanchion by winding a piece of
rope round his body whilst he clasped in his arms and held fast to his
breast two girls of fifteen or sixteen half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeerskin A large fallow Siberian dog dripping with water and
barking furiously at the waves stood close to their feet

These girls clasped in the arms of the old man also pressed close to
each other but far from being lost in terror they raised their
eyes to heaven full of confidence and ingenuous hope as though they
expected to be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power

A frightful shriek of horror and despair raised by the passengers of
both vessels was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest At the
moment when plunging deeply between two waves the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship the latter lifted to
a prodigious height on a mountain of water remained as it were
suspended over the William Tell during the second which preceded the
shock of the two vessels

There are sights of so sublime a horror that it is impossible to
describe them Yet in the midst of these catastrophes swift as
thought one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture rapid
and fleeting as if illumined by a flash of lightning

Thus when the Black Eagle poised aloft by the flood was about
to crash down upon the William Tell the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair waving locks bent over the prow of the ship ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim Suddenly he perceived
on board the steamer on which he looked down from the summit of
the immense wave the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication They appeared to recognize him and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage

For a second in spite of the horrors of the tempest in spite of the
approaching shipwreck the looks of those three beings met The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer seemed to invoke him as
their expected Saviour The old man struck down by the fall of a plank
lay helpless on the deck Soon all disappeared together

A fearful mass of water dashed the Black Eagle down upon the William
Tell in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam To the dreadful crash
of the two great bodies of wood and iron which splintering against one
another instantly foundered one loud cry was addeda cry of agony and
deaththe cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves

And thennothing more was visible

A few moments after the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea and on the caps of the waveswith here and there
the contracted arms the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy
wretches striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore at
the risk of being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers




CHAPTER XXV THE SHIPWRECK

While the bailiff was gone to the seashore to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck M
Rodin conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber had there found the
articles that he was to take with him to Paris

After passing two hours in this apartment very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons which alone absorbed the attention of
the inhabitants of the Castle Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff a room which opened upon a long gallery When
he entered it he found nobody there Under his arm he held a casket
with silver fastenings almost black from age whilst one end of a
large red morocco portfolio projected from the breastpocket of his half
buttoned great coat

Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe dAigrignys secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile his
features would have been radiant with delight for just then he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts Having placed
the casket upon a table it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself

All goes well It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know Fortunately the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her Her fate will be a cruel one it
must be so Those proud independent characters are at all times our
natural enemiesthey are so by their very essencehow much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous As for La Sainte
Colombe the bailiff is sure to act for us between what the fool
calls his conscience and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood he will not hesitate I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrowminded woman
Once in the hands of our man at Roiville I will answer for the result
The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand
in their youth they serve the devil in riper years they make others
serve him in their old age they are horribly afraid of him and this
fear must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville
which from its isolated position will make us an excellent college
All then goes well As for the affair of the medals the 13th of
February approaches without news from Joshuaevidently Prince Djalma
is still kept prisoner by the English in the heart of India or I must
have received letters from Batavia The daughters of General Simon will
be detained at Leipsic for at least a month longer All our foreign
relations are in the best condition As for our internal affairs

 Here M Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need

Now said she to the servant light a fire in the next room put this
warm wine there your master may be in every minute

Well my dear madam said Rodin to her do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures

Alas I do not know sir My husband has been gone nearly two hours I
am terribly uneasy on his account He is so courageous so imprudent if
once he thinks he can be of any service

Courageous even to imprudence said Rodin to himself impatiently I
do not like that

Well resumed Catherine I have here at hand my hot linen my
cordialsheaven grant it may all be of use

We may at least hope so my dear madam I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions
and to wish him joy if successfulfor I am unfortunately compelled to
depart my moments are precious I shall be much obliged if you will
have the carriage got ready

Yes Sir I will see about it directly

One word my dear good Madame Dupont You are a woman of sense and
excellent judgment Now I have put your husband in the way to keep if
he will his situation as bailiff of the estate

Is it possible What gratitude do we not owe you Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life

I have only saddled my promise with two conditionsmere trifleshe
will explain all that to you

Ah sir we shall regard you as our deliverer

You are too good Only on two little conditions

If there were a hundred sir we should gladly accept them Think what
we should be without this placepennilessabsolutely penniless

I reckon upon you then for the interest of your husband you will try
to persuade him

Missus I say missus heres master come back cried a servant
rushing into the chamber

Has he many with him

No missus he is alone

Alone alone

Quite alone missus

A few moments after M Dupont entered the room his clothes were
streaming with water to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat which was knotted
under his chin his gaiters were covered with chalky stains

There I have thee my dear love cried his wife tenderly embracing
him I have been so uneasy

Up to the present momentTHREE SAVED

God be praised my dear M Dupont said Rodin at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain

Three only three said Catherine Gracious heaven

I only speak of those I saw myself near the little creek of Goelands
Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast

Yes indeed happily the shore is not equally steep in all parts

And where are these interesting sufferers my dear sir asked Rodin
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer

They are mounting the cliffs supported by our people As they cannot
walk very fast I ran on before to console my wife and to take the
necessary measures for their reception First of all my dear you must
get ready some womens clothes

There is then a woman amongst the persons saved

There are two girlsfifteen or sixteen years of age at the mostmere
childrenand so pretty

Poor little things said Rodin with an affectation of interest

The person to whom they owe their lives is with them He is a real
hero

A hero

Yes only fancy

You can tell me all this by and by Just slip on this dry warm
dressinggown and take some of this hot wine You are wet through

Ill not refuse for I am almost frozen to death I was telling you
that the person who saved these young girls was a hero and certainly
his courage was beyond anything one could have imagined When I left
here with the men of the farm we descended the little winding path
and arrived at the foot of the cliffnear the little creek of Goelands
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea Well what should we find
there Why the two young girls I spoke of in a swoon with their feet
still in the water and their bodies resting against a rock as though
they had been placed there by some one after being withdrawn from the
sea

Dear children it is quite touching said M Rodin raising as usual
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye as though
to dry a tear which was very seldom visible

What struck me was their great resemblance to each other resumed
the bailiff only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference

Twinsisters no doubt said Madame Dupont

One of the poor things continued the bailiff held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal which was suspended from her neck
by a chain of the same material

Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture but at these last
words of the bailiff he drew himself up suddenly whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks In any other person these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence but in Rodin accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions they announced
no ordinary excitement Approaching the bailiff he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice but still with an air of indifference It was
doubtless a pious relic Did you see what was inscribed on this medal

No sir I did not think of it

And the two young girls were like one anothervery much like you
say

So like that one would hardly know which was which Probably they are
orphans for they are dressed in mourning

Oh dressed in mourning said M Rodin with another start

Alas orphans so young said Madame Dupont wiping her eyes

As they had fainted away we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry While we were busy about this we saw the head
of a man appear from behind one of the rocks which he was trying to
climb clinging to it by one hand we ran to him and luckily in the
nick of time for he was clean worn out and fell exhausted into the
arms of our men It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero for not
content with having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage
he had attempted to rescue a third person and had actually gone back
amongst the rocks and breakersbut his strength failed him and
without the aid of our men he would certainly have been washed away
from the ridge to which he clung

He must indeed be a fine fellow said Catherine

Rodin with his head bowed upon his breast seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation The dismay and stupor in which he had been plunged
only increased upon reflection The two girls who had just been saved
were fifteen years of age were dressed in mourning were so like that
one might be taken for the other one of them wore round her neck a
chain with a bronze medal he could scarcely doubt that they were the
daughters of General Simon But how could those sisters be amongst the
number of shipwrecked passengers How could they have escaped from the
prison at Leipsic How did it happen that he had not been informed of
it Could they have fled or had they been set at liberty How was
it possible that he should not be apprise of such an event But these
secondary thoughts which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of
M Rodin were swallowed up in the one fact the daughters of General
Simon are hereHis plan so laboriously laid was thus entirely
destroyed

When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls resumed the
bailiff addressing his wife and without remarking M Rodins absence
of mind you are expecting no doubt to see a Herculeswell he is
altogether the reverse He is almost a boy in look with fair sweet
face and light curling locks I left him a cloak to cover him for he
had nothing on but his shirt black kneebreeches and a pair of black
worsted stockingswhich struck me as singular

Why it was certainly not a sailors dress

Besides though the ship was English I believe my hero is a Frenchman
for he speaks our language as well as we do What brought the tears to
my eyes was to see the young girls when they came to themselves As
soon as they saw him they threw themselves at his feet and seemed to
look up to him and thank him as one would pray Then they cast their
eyes around them as if in search of some other person and having
exchanged a few words they fell sobbing into each others arms

What a dreadful thing it is How many poor creatures must have
perished

When we quitted the rocks the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies besides fragments of the wrecks and packages I spoke to some
of the coastguard and they will remain all day on the lookout and
if as I hope any more should escape with life they are to be
brought here But surely that is the sound of voicesyes it is our
shipwrecked guests

The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the roomthat door which
opened on the long gallerywhilst Rodin biting convulsively his flat
nails awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view

From the end of the dark some gallery only lighted on one side by
several windows three persons conducted by a peasant advanced slowly
This group consisted of the two maidens and the intrepid young man
to whom they owed their lives Rose and Blanche were on either side of
their deliverer who walking with great difficulty supported himself
lightly on their arms

Though he was full twentyfive years of age the juvenile countenance
of this man made him appear younger His long fair hair parted on
the forehead streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown
cloak with which he had been covered It would be difficult to describe
the adorable expression of goodness in his pale mild face as pure as
the most ideal creations of Raphaels pencilfor that divine artist
alone could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite
features the serenity of that celestial look from eyes limpid and blue
as those of an archangel or of a martyr ascended to the skies

Yes of a martyr for a bloodred halo already encircled that beauteous
head Piteous sight to see just above his light eyebrows and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold a narrow cicatrix from
a wound inflicted many months before appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band and still more sad his hands had
been cruelly pierced by a crucifixionhis feet had suffered the same
injuryand if he now walked with so much difficulty it was that his
wounds had reopened as he struggled over the sharp rocks

This young man was Gabriel the priest attached to the foreign mission
the adopted son of Dagoberts wife He was a priest and martyrfor in
our days there are still martyrs as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus

Yes in our days the children of the peoplefor it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
foundthe children of the people led by an honorable conviction
because it is courageous and sincere go to all parts of the world to
try and propagate their faith and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor

How many of them victims of some barbarous tribe have perished
obscure and unknown in the midst of the solitudes of the two
worldsAnd for these humble soldiers of the cross who have nothing
but their faith and their intrepidity there is never reserved on their
return and they seldom do return the rich and sumptuous dignities of
the church Never does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred
brows and mutilated limbs like the great majority of other soldiers
they die forgotten8

In their ingenuous gratitude the daughters of General Simon as soon
as they recovered their senses after the shipwreck and felt themselves
able to ascend the cliffs would not leave to any other person the
care of sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from
certain death

The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water their faces
were deadly pale and expressive of deep grief the marks of recent
tears were on their cheeks and with sad downcast eyes they trembled
both from agitation and cold as the agonizing thought recurred to them
that they should never again see Dagobert their friend and guide for
it was to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand to assist
him to climb the rocks Unfortunately the strength of both had failed
and the soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave

The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin who had retired on
one side in order to observe all but this surprise was of so pleasant
a nature and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril that the painful impression caused by the view
of General Simons daughters was a little softened It must not
be forgotten that the presence of Gabriel in Paris on the 13th of
February was essential to the success of Rodins projects

The bailiff and his wife who were greatly moved at sight of the
orphans approached them with eagerness Just then a farmboy entered
the room crying Sir sir good newstwo more saved from the wreck

Blessing and praise to God for it said the missionary

Where are they asked the bailiff hastening towards the door

There is one who can walk and is following behind me with Justin
the other was wounded against the rocks and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches

I will run and have him placed in the room below said the bailiff as
he went out Catherine you can look to the young ladies

And the shipwrecked man who can walkwhere is he asked the bailiffs
wife

Here he is said the peasant pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery when he heard that the two young ladies were safe
in the chateauthough he is old and wounded in the head he took such
great strides that it was all I could do to get here before him

Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words when Rose and Blanche
springing up by a common impulse flew to the door They arrived there
at the same moment as Dagobert

The soldier unable to utter a syllable fell on his knees at the
threshold and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon
while Spoilsport running to them licked their hands

But the emotion was too much for Dagobert and when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms his head fell backward and he would have sunk
down altogether but for the care of the peasants In spite of the
observations of the bailiffs wife on their state of weakness and
agitation the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert who
was carried fainting into an adjoining apartment

At sight of the soldier Rodins face was again violently contracted
for he had till then believed that the guide of General Simons
daughters was dead The missionary worn out with fatigue was leaning
upon a chair and had not yet perceived Rodin

A new personage a man with a dead yellow complexion now entered the
room accompanied by another peasant who pointed out Gabriel to him
This man who had just borrowed a smockfrock and a pair of trousers
approached the missionary and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent Prince Djalma has just been brought in here His first word was
to ask for you

What does that man say cried Rodin in a voice of thunder for at
the name of Djalma he had sprung with one bound to Gabriels side

M Rodin exclaimed the missionary falling back in surprise

M Rodin cried the other shipwrecked person and from that moment he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M Van Dael

You here sir said Gabriel approaching Rodin with an air of
deference not unmixed with fear

What did that man say to you repeated Rodin in an excited tone Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma

Yes sir Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship which came from Alexandria and in which we have just been
wrecked This vessel touched at the Azores where I then was the ship
that brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there
and being likely to remain for some time on account of serious damage
I embarked on board the Black Eagle where I met Prince Djalma We
were bound to Portsmouth and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France

Rodin did not care to interrupt Gabriel This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts At length like a man who catches at a last
hope which he knows beforehand to be vain he said to Gabriel Can you
tell me who this Prince Djalma is

A young man as good as bravethe son of an East Indian king
dispossessed of his territory by the English

Then turning towards the other shipwrecked man the missionary said
to him with anxious interest How is the Prince are his wounds
dangerous

They are serious contusions but they will not be mortal answered the
other

Heaven be praised said the missionary addressing Rodin here you
see is another saved

So much the better observed Rodin in a quick imperious tone

I will go see him said Gabriel submissively You have no orders to
give me

Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours
notwithstanding your fatigue

If it be necessaryyes

It is necessary You will go with me

Gabriel only bowed in reply and Rodin sank confounded into a chair
while the missionary went out with the peasant The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room unperceived by Rodin

This man was Faringhea the halfcaste one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins
of Tchandi he had killed Mahal the Smuggler and robbed him of the
despatches written by M Joshua Van Dael to Rodin as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board
the Ruyter When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi
he had not been seen by Djalma and the latter when he met him on
shipboard after his escape which we shall explain by and by not
knowing that he belonged to the sect of Phansegars treated him during
the voyage as a fellowcountryman

Rodin with his eye fixed and haggard his countenance of a livid hue
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage did not perceive the half
caste who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder said to him Your name is Rodin

What now asked the other starting and raising his head abruptly

Your name is Rodin repeated Faringhea

Yes What do you want

You live in the Rue du MilieudesUrsins Paris

Yes But once more what do you want

Nothing now brother hereafter much

And Faringhea retiring with slow steps left Rodin alarmed at what
had passed for this man who scarcely trembled at anything had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler

8 We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written two or
three years ago by one of these young and valiant missionaries the son
of poor parents in Beauce He was writing to his mother from the heart
of Japan and thus concluded his letter Adieu my dear mother they
say there is much danger where I am now sent to Pray for me and tell
all our good neighbors that I think of them very often These few
words addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of
France are only the more touching from their very simplicityE S




CHAPTER XXVI THE DEPARTURE FOR PARIS

The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House The
tempest has lulled by degrees and nothing is heard from afar but the
hoarse murmur of the waves as they wash heavily the shore

Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the firstfloor of the chateau Djalma too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs has remained in a room below At the moment of
the shipwreck a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms He
had failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death but his generous devotion had hampered his movements and when
thrown upon the rocks he was almost dashed to pieces Faringhea who
has been able to convince him of his affection remains to watch over
him

Gabriel after administering consolation to Djalma has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him faithful to the promise he made to Rodin to be
ready to set out in two hours he has not gone to bed but having dried
his clothes he has fallen asleep in a large highbacked armchair
placed in front of a bright coalfire His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters

Spoilsport probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling
has quitted the door of Rose and Blanches chamber to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth by the side of which the missionary is sleeping
There with his nose resting on his outstretched paws he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose after so many perils by land and
sea We will not venture to affirm that he thinks habitually of poor
old Jovial unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part
his irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met
with ever since the death of his venerable companion though before he
was the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color

Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened and the two sisters
entered timidly Awake for some minutes they had risen and dressed
themselves feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert
though the bailiffs wife after showing them to their room had
returned again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing
serious in the hurt of the old soldier still they hoped to meet some
one belonging to the chateau of whom they could make further inquiries
about him

The high back of the oldfashioned armchair in which Gabriel was
sleeping completely screened him from view but the orphans seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet thought it was Dagobert
reposing there and hastened towards him on tiptoe To their great
astonishment they saw Gabriel fast asleep and stood still in
confusion not daring to advance or recede for fear of waking him

The long light hair of the missionary was no longer wet and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking from the contrast afforded by the deep purple
of the damask covering of the armchair His beautiful countenance
expressed a profound melancholy either caused by the influence of some
painful dream or else that he was in the habit of keeping down when
awake some sad regrets which revealed themselves without his knowledge
when he was sleeping Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief
his features preserved their character of angelic sweetness and seemed
endowed with an inexpressible charm for nothing is more touching than
suffering goodness The two young girls cast down their eyes blushed
simultaneously and exchanged anxious glances as if to point out to
each other the slumbering missionary

He sleeps sister said Rose in a low voice

So much the better replied Blanche also in a whisper making a sign
of caution we shall now be able to observe him well

Yes for we durst not do so in coming from the sea hither

Look what a sweet countenance

He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams

When he promised he would protect us

And he has not failed us

But here at least he is visible

Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic during that dark night

And sohe has again rescued us

Without him we should have perished this morning

And yet sister it seems to me that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light

Yes you know it dazzled us to look at him

And then he had not so sad a mien

That was because he came then from heaven now he is upon earth

But sister had he then that bright red scar round his forehead

Oh no we should have certainly perceived it

And these other marks on his hands

If he has been wounded how can he be an archangel

Why not sister If he received those wounds in preventing evil or in
helping the unfortunate who like us were about to perish

You are right If he did not run any danger for those he protects it
would be less noble

What a pity that he does not open his eye

Their expression is so good so tender

Why did he not speak of our mother by the way

We were not alone with him he did not like to do so

But now we are alone

If we were to pray to him to speak to us

The orphans looked doubtingly at each other with charming simplicity a
bright glow suffused their cheeks and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses

You are right Let us kneel down to him

Oh sister our hearts beat so said Blanche believing rightly that
Rose felt exactly as she did And yet it seems to do us good It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us

The sisters having approached the armchair on tiptoe knelt down
with clasped hands one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest It was a charming picture Turning their lovely faces towards
him they said in a low whisper with a soft sweet voice well suited
to their youthful appearance Gabriel speak to us of our mother

On this appeal the missionary gave a slight start halfopened his
eyes and still in a state of semiconsciousness between sleep and
waking beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him and heard
two gentle voices repeat his name

Who calls me said he rousing himself and raising his head

It is Blanche and Rose

It was now Gabriels turn to blush for he recognized the young girls he
had saved Rise my sisters said he to them you should kneel only
unto God

The orphans obeyed and were soon beside him holding each other by the
hand You know my name it seems said the missionary with a smile

Oh we have not forgotten it

Who told it you

Yourself I

Yeswhen you came from our mother

I my sisters said the missionary unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans You are mistaken I saw you today for the first time

But in our dreams

Yesdo you not rememberin our dreams

In Germanythree months ago for the first time Look at us well

Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche
who expected him to remember a dream of theirs growing more and more
perplexed he repeated In your dreams

Certainly when you gave us such good advice

And when we were so sorrowful in prison your words which we
remembered consoled us and gave us courage

Was it not you who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic in that
dark night when we were not able to see you

I

What other but you would thus have come to our help and to that of our
old friend

We told him that you would love him because he loved us although he
would not believe in angels

And this morning during the tempest we had hardly any fear

Because we expected you

This morningyes my sistersit pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance I was coming from America but I have never been in
Leipsic I could not therefore have let you out of prison Tell me my
sisters added he with a benevolent smile for whom do you take me

For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams sent by our
mother from heaven to protect us

My dear sisters I am only a poor priest It is by mere chance no
doubt that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams and whom you could not see in any other mannerfor angels are
not visible to mortal eye

Angels are not visible said the orphans looking sorrowfully at each
other

No matter my dear sisters said Gabriel taking them affectionately
by the hand dreams like everything else come from above Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream it is twice
blessed

At this moment a door opened and Dagobert made his appearance Up to
this time the orphans in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagoberts wife
had adopted a forsaken child who was called Gabriel and who was now a
priest and missionary

The soldier though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound to use a term of General Simons had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village and now wore a black
bandage which concealed one half of his forehead and added to the
natural grimness of his features On entering the room he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own This surprise was natural for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans and had
attempted to save his also

In the midst of the storm tossed about by the waves and vainly
striving to cling to the rocks the soldier had only seen Gabriel
very imperfectly at the moment when having snatched the sisters from
certain death the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to
his aid And when after the shipwreck Dagobert had found the orphans
in safety beneath the roof of the Manor House he fell as we have
already stated into a swoon caused by fatigue emotion and the
effects of his woundso that he had again no opportunity of observing
the features of the missionary

The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick
gray brows at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche
but the sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms and to cover him
with filial caresses His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection though he continued from time to time to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary who had risen from his seat but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish

How is your wound asked Rose anxiously They told us it was not
dangerous

Does it still pain added Blanche

No children the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts I could not have
more wrappings They will take me for an old milksop it is only a blank
wound and I have a good mind to And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage

Will you leave that alone cried Rose catching his arm How can you
be so unreasonableat your age

Well well dont scold I will do what you wish and keep it on
Then drawing the sisters to one end of the room he said to them in a
low voice whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his
eye Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in
He has very much the look of a curate You see my children you must be
on your guard because

He cried both sisters at once turning towards Gabriel Without him
we should not now be here to kiss you

Whats that cried the soldier suddenly drawing up his tall figure
and gazing full at the missionary

It is our guardian angel resumed Blanche

Without him said Rose we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck

Ah it is he who Dagobert could say no more With swelling heart
and tears in his eyes he ran to the missionary offered him both his
hands and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe
Sir I owe you the lives of these two children I feel what a debt
that service lays upon me I will not say morebecause it includes
everything

Then as if struck with a sudden recollection he cried Stop when
I was trying to cling to a rock so as not to be carried away by the
waves was it not you that held out your hand to me Yesthat light
hairthat youthful countenanceyesit was certainly younow I am
sure of it

Unhappily sir my strength failed me and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea

I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said answered Dagobert with touching simplicity in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life
But what heart and courage added the soldier with admiration and so
young with such a girlish look

And so cried Blanche joyfully our Gabriel came to your aid also

Gabriel said Dagobert interrupting Blanche and addressing himself to
the priest Is your name Gabriel

Yes sir

Gabriel repeated the soldier more and more surprised And a
priest added he

A priest of the foreign missions

Whowho brought you up asked the soldier with increasing
astonishment

An excellent and generous woman whom I revere as the best of mothers
for she had pity on me a deserted infant and treated me ever as her
son

Frances Baudoinwas it not said the soldier with deep emotion

It was sir answered Gabriel astonished in his turn But how do you
know this

The wife of a soldier eh continued Dagobert

Yes of a brave soldierwho from the most admirable devotion is even
now passing his life in exilefar from his wifefar from his son my
dear brotherfor I am proud to call him by that name

My Agricolamy wifewhen did you leave them

What is it possible You the father of AgricolaOh I knew not
until now cried Gabriel clasping his hands together I knew not all
the gratitude that I owed to heaven

And my wife my child resumed Dagobert in a trembling voice how
are they have you news of them

The accounts I received three months ago were excellent

No it is too much cried Dagobert it is too much The veteran
was unable to proceed his feelings stifled his words and fell back
exhausted in a chair

And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their fathers
letter which related to the child named Gabriel whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy

Our Gabriel is the same as yourswhat happiness cried Rose

Yes my children he belongs to you as well as to me We have all
our part in him Then addressing Gabriel the soldier added with
affectionate warmth Your hand my brave boy give me your hand

Oh sir you are too good to me

Yesthats itthank meafter all thou has done for us

Does my adopted mother know of your return asked Gabriel anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier

I wrote to her five months since but said that I should come alone
there was a reason for it which I will explain by and by Does she
still live in the Rue BriseMiche It was there Agricola was born

She still lives there

In that case she must have received my letter I wished to write to
her from the prison at Leipsic but it was impossible

From prison Have you just come out of prison

Yes I come straight from Germany by the Elbe and Hamburg and I
should be still at Leipsic but for an event which the Devil must have
had a hand ina good sort of devil though

What do you mean Pray explain to me

That would be difficult for I cannot explain it to myself These
little ladies he added pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche
pretended to know more about it than I did and were continually
repeating It was the angel that came to our assistance Dagobertthe
good angel we told thee ofthough you said you would rather have Spoil
sport to defend us

Gabriel I am waiting for you said a stern voice which made the
missionary start They all turned round instantly whilst the dog
uttered a deep growl

It was Rodin He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor His
features were calm and impassive but he darted a rapid piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters

Who is that man said Dagobert very little prepossessed in favor
of Rodin whose countenance he found singularly repulsive What the
mischief does he want

I must go with him answered Gabriel in a tone of sorrowful
constraint Then turning to Rodin he added A thousand pardons I
shall be ready in a moment

What cried Dagobert stupefied with amazement going the very
instant we have just met No by my faith you shall not go I have
too much to tell you and to ask in return We will make the journey
together It will be a real treat for me

It is impossible He is my superior and I must obey him

Your superiorwhy hes in citizens dress

He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb

Rubbish since he is not in uniform and there is no provostmarshal in
your troop send him to the

Believe me I would not hesitate a minute if it were possible to
remain

I was right in disliking the phi of that man muttered Dagobert
between his teeth Then he added with an air of impatience and
vexation Shall I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off
by himself

I beg you not to do so said Gabriel it would be useless I know
my duty and have no will but my superiors As soon as you arrive in
Paris I will come and see you as also my adopted mother and my dear
brother Agricola

Wellif it must be I have been a soldier and know what subordination
is said Dagobert much annoyed One must put a good face on bad
fortune So the day after tomorrow in the Rue BriseMiche my boy
for they tell me I can be in Paris by tomorrow evening and we set out
almost immediately But I saythere seems to be a strict discipline
with you fellows

Yes it is strict and severe answered Gabriel with a shudder and a
stifled sigh

Come shake handsand lets say farewell for the present After all
twentyfour hours will soon pass away

Adieu adieu replied the missionary much moved whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veterans hand

Adieu Gabriel added the orphans sighing also and with tears in
their eyes

Adieu my sisters said Gabrieland he left the room with Rodin who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene

Two hours after Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville being still
too much injured to proceed on his journey The halfcaste Faringhea
remained with the young prince not wishing he said to desert a fellow
countryman

We now conduct the reader to the Rue BriseMiche the residence of
Dagoberts wife




CHAPTER XXVII DAGOBERTS WIFE

The following scenes occur in Paris on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House

Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue BriseMiche one
end of which leads into the Rue SaintMerry and the other into the
little square of the Cloister near the church At this end the street
or rather alleyfor it is not more than eight feet wideis shut in
between immense black muddy dilapidated walls the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light hardly during the longest days
of the year is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams
whilst during the cold damps of winter a chilling fog which seems to
penetrate everything hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this
species of oblong well

It was about eight oclock in the evening by the faint reddish light
of the street lamp hardly visible through the haze two men stopping
at the angle of one of those enormous walls exchanged a few words
together

So said one you understand all about it You are to watch in the
street till you see them enter No 5

All right answered the other

And when you see em enter so as to make quite sure of the game go up
to Frances Baudoins room

Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
livesthe sister of that gay girl the Queen of the Bacchanals

Yesand you must try and find out her address alsofrom her
humpbacked sister if possiblefor it is very important Women of her
feather change their nests like birds and we have lost track of her

Make yourself easy I will do my best with Hump to learn where her
sister hangs out

And to give you steam Ill wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister and well have a go of hot wine on your return

Ill not refuse for the night is deucedly cold

Dont mention it This morning the water friz on my sprinklingbrush
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the churchdoor Ah my
boy a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses

Luckily you have the pickings

Well wellgood luck to you Dont forget the Fiver the little
passage next to the dyers shop

Yes yesall right and the two men separated

One proceeded to the Cloister Square the other towards the further end
of the street where it led into the Rue SaintMerry This latter
soon found the number of the house he soughta tall narrow building
having like all the other houses in the street a poor and wretched
appearance When he saw he was right the man commenced walking
backwards and forwards in front of the door of No 5

If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described The house No 5 was in a special
degree dirty and dilapidated The water which oozed from the wall
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase On the second floor a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landingplace for wiping the feet
on but this straw being now quite rotten only served to augment the
sickening odor which arose from want of air from damp and from
the putrid exhalations of the drains The few openings cut at rare
intervals in the walls of the staircase could hardly admit more than
some faint rays of glimmering light

In this quarter one of the most populous in Paris such houses as
these poor cheerless and unhealthy are generally inhabited by
the working classes The house in question was of the number A dyer
occupied the ground floor the deleterious vapors arising from his vats
added to the stench of the whole building On the upper stories several
artisans lodged with their families or carried on their different
trades Up four flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin
wife of Dagobert It consisted of one room with a closet adjoining and
was now lighted by a single candle Agricola occupied a garret in the
roof

Old grayish paper broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall against which rested the bed scanty curtains running upon an
iron rod concealed the windows the brick floor not polished but
often washed had preserved its natural color At one end of this room
was a round iron stove with a large pot for culinary purposes On the
wooden table painted yellow marbled with brown stood a miniature
house made of irona masterpiece of patience and skill the work of
Agricola Baudoin Dagoberts son

A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall surrounded by several
branches of consecrated boxtree and various images of saints very
coarsely colored bore witness to the habits of the soldiers wife
Between the windows stood one of those old walnutwood presses
curiously fashioned and almost black with time an old armchair
covered with green cotton velvet Agricolas first present to his
mother a few rush bottomed chairs and a worktable on which lay
several bags of coarse brown cloth completed the furniture of this
room badly secured by a wormeaten door The adjoining closet contained
a few kitchen and household utensils

Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear it would not seem
so to the greater number of artisans for the bed was supplied with
two mattresses clean sheets and a warm counterpane the oldfashioned
press contained linen and moreover Dagoberts wife occupied all to
herself a room as large as those in which numerous families belonging
to honest and laborious workmen often live and sleep huddled
togetheronly too happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds
or if the sheets and blankets are not pledged at the pawnbrokers

Frances Baudoin seated beside the small stove which in the cold and
damp weather yielded but little warmth was busied in preparing her son
Agricolas evening meal

Dagoberts wife was about fifty years of age she wore a close jacket
of blue cotton with white flowers on it and a stuff petticoat a white
handkerchief was tied round her head and fastened under the chin Her
countenance was pale and meagre the features regular and expressive of
resignation and great kindness It would have been difficult to find a
better a more courageous mother With no resource but her labor she
had succeeded by unwearied energy in bringing up not only her own
son Agricola but also Gabriel the poor deserted child of whom with
admirable devotion she had ventured to take charge

In her youth she had as it were anticipated the strength of later
life by twelve years of incessant toil rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal Then for it was a time of splendid wages compared to the
present by sleepless nights and constant labor she contrived to earn
about two shillings fifty sous a day and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child

At the end of these twelve years her health was ruined and her
strength nearly exhausted but at all events her boys had wanted for
nothing and had received such an education as children of the people
can obtain About this time M Francois Hardy took Agricola as an
apprentice and Gabriel prepared to enter the priests seminary
under the active patronage of M Rodin whose communications with the
confessor of Frances Baudoin had become very frequent about the year
1820

This woman whose piety had always been excessive was one of those
simple natures endowed with extreme goodness whose selfdenial
approaches to heroism and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdompure and heavenly minds in whom the instincts of the
heart supply the place of the intellect

The only defect or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor to whose influence she
had now for many years been accustomed to submit She regarded this
influence as most venerable and sacred no mortal power no human
consideration could have prevented her from obeying it Did any dispute
arise on the subject nothing could move her on this point she opposed
to every argument a resistance entirely free from passionmild as her
disposition calm as her consciencebut like the latter not to
be shaken In a word Frances Baudoin was one of those pure but
uninstructed and credulous beings who may sometimes in skillful and
dangerous hands become without knowing it the instruments of much
evil

For some time past the bad state of her health and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight had condemned her to a forced repose
unable to work more than two or three hours a day she consumed the rest
of her time at church

Frances rose from her seat pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her sons supper with maternal care and solicitude She took from
the press a small leathern bag containing an old silver cup very much
battered and a fork and spoon so worn and thin that the latter cut
like a knife These her only plate the wedding present of Dagobert
she rubbed and polished as well as she was able and laid by the side of
her sons plate They were the most precious of her possessions not so
much for what little intrinsic value might attach to them as for the
associations they recalled and she had often shed bitter tears when
under the pressure of illness or want of employment she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbrokers

Frances next took from the lower shelf of the press a bottle of water
and one of wine about threequarters full which she also placed near
her sons plate she then returned to the stove to watch the cooking of
the supper

Though Agricola was not much later than usual the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief one might have seen by the
redness of her eyes that she had been weeping a good deal After
long and painful uncertainty the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight which had been growing weaker and weaker
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors

Originally an excellent hand at her needle she had been obliged as
her eyesight gradually failed her to abandon the finer for the
coarser sorts of work and her earnings had necessarily diminished in
proportion she had at length been reduced to the necessity of making
those coarse bags for the army which took about four yards of sewing
and were paid at the rate of two sous each she having to find her own
thread This work being very hard she could at most complete three
such bags in a day and her gains thus amounted to threepence six
sous

It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations old age or
sickness that all the labor of which they are capable hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion

Happily Frances had an efficient support in her son A firstrate
workman profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M Hardy his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a daymore than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing he could easily maintain
both her and himself

But the poor woman so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy since she had adopted the habit
of visiting daily the parish church Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung or tapers burnt either for Dagobert from whom she had
been so long separated or for the salvation of her son Agricola whom
she considered on the highroad to perdition Agricola had so excellent
a heart so loved and revered his mother and considered her actions
in this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his weeks wages which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday disappear in pious forms

Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances with as much respect
as tenderness that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses But what answer could he make to this excellent mother when
she replied with tears My child tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too

To dispute the efficacy of masses would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola through respect for his mothers religious
faith never discussed He contented himself therefore with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed

A discreet tap was heard at the door Come in said Frances The
person came in




CHAPTER XXVIII THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN

The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen short and very
much deformed Though not exactly a hunchback her spine was curved her
breast was sunken and her head deeply set in the shoulders Her face
was regular but long thin very pale and pitted with the small pox
yet it expressed great sweetness and melancholy Her blue eyes beamed
with kindness and intelligence By a strange freak of nature the
handsomest woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted
in a coarse net at the back of her head She held an old basket in her
hand Though miserably clad the care and neatness of her dress revealed
a powerful struggle with her poverty Notwithstanding the cold she
wore a scanty frock made of print of an indefinable color spotted with
white but it had been so often washed that its primitive design and
color had long since disappeared In her resigned yet suffering face
might be read a long familiarity with every form of suffering every
description of taunting From her birth ridicule had ever pursued her
We have said that she was very deformed and she was vulgarly called
Mother Bunch Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name
which every moment reminded her of her infirmity that Frances and
Agricola though they felt as much compassion as other people showed
contempt for her never called her however by any other name

Mother Bunch as we shall therefore call her in future was born in the
house in which Dagoberts wife had resided for more than twenty years
and she had as it were been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel

There are wretches fatally doomed to misery Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister on whom Perrine Soliveau their common mother the widow
of a ruined tradesman had concentrated all her affection while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness The latter
would often come weeping to Frances on this account who tried to
console her and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read
and sew Accustomed to pity her by their mothers example instead of
imitating other children who always taunted and sometimes even beat
her Agricola and Gabriel liked her and used to protect and defend her

She was about fifteen and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen
when their mother died leaving them both in utter poverty Cephyse was
intelligent active clever but different to her sister she had the
lively alert hoydenish character which requires air exercise and
pleasuresa good girl enough but foolishly spoiled by her mother
Cephyse listening at first to Francess good advice resigned herself
to her lot and having learnt to sew worked like her sister for
about a year But unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings notwithstanding her incessant toil exposed
her toprivations which often bordered on starvationCephyse young
pretty of warm temperament and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductionsbrilliant indeed for her since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger shelter from the cold and decent raiment without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovelCephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyers clerk who
forsook her soon after She formed a connection with another clerk whom
she instructed by the examples set her forsook in turn for a bagman
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites In a word what with
changing and being forsaken Cephyse in the course of one or two years
was the idol of a set of grisettes students and clerks and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris by her
decision of character original turn of mind and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures and especially her wild noisy gayety that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty

From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals She still mourned for her and continued to toil hard to
gain her threeandsix a week The unfortunate girl having been taught
sewing by Frances made coarse shirts for the common people and the
army For these she received halfacrown a dozen They had to be
hemmed stitched provided with collars and wristbands buttons and
button holes and at the most when at work twelve and fifteen hours a
day she rarely succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen
shirts a weekan excessive amount of toil that brought her in about
three shillings and fourpence a week And the case of this poor girl
was neither accidental nor uncommon And this because the remuneration
given for womens work is an example of revolting injustice and savage
barbarism They are paid not half as much as men who are employed at the
needle such as tailors and makers of gloves or waistcoats etcno
doubt because women can work as well as menbecause they are more weak
and delicateand because their need may be twofold as great when they
become mothers

Well Mother Bunch fagged on with threeandfour a week That is to
say toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day she succeeded
in keeping herself alive in spite of exposure to hunger cold and
povertyso numerous were her privations Privations No The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives namely wholesome
air and shelter sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing
Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital which a justly organized state of society
oughtyesought necessarily to bestow on every active honest
workman and workwoman since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right and left them no other patrimony than their hands

The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization but he has at
least the beasts of the field the fowls of the air the fish of the
sea and the fruits of the earth to feed him and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel The civilized man disinherited of these gifts
considering the rights of property as sacred may in return for his
hard daily labor which enriches his country demand wages that will
enable him to live in the enjoyment of health nothing more and
nothing less For is it living to drag along on the extreme edge which
separates life from the grave and even there continually struggle
against cold hunger and disease And to show how far the mortification
which society imposes thus inexorably on its millions of honest
industrious laborers by its careless disregard of all the questions
which concern the just remuneration of labor may extend we will
describe how this poor girl contrived to live on three shillings and
sixpence a week

Society perhaps may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting with resignation the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity
Yes to live at such a price is virtue Yes society thus organized
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery loses all right to
blame the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery but
because they are cold and famishing This poor girl spent her wages as
follows

 Six pounds of bread second quality0 8 12
 Four pails of water0 2
 Lard or dripping butter being out of the question0 5
 Coarse salt0 0 34
 A bushel of charcoal0 4
 A quart of dried vegetables0 3
 Three quarts of potatoes0 2
 Dips0 3 14
 Thread and needles0 2 12
 ______
 2 7

To save charcoal Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story
On other days she ate it cold There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging By rare good fortune her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others Agricola that he
might not wound her delicacy had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper and hired a garret for her just large enough to hold a
small bed a chair and a table for which the sempstress had to pay
five shillings a year But Agricola in fulfilment of his agreement with
the porter paid the balance to make up the actual rent of the
garret which was twelve and sixpence The poor girl had thus about
eighteenpence a month left for her other expenses But many workwomen
whose position is less fortunate than hers since they have neither
home nor family buy a piece of bread and some other food to keep them
through the day and at night patronize the twopenny rope one with
another in a wretched room containing five or six beds some of which
are always engaged by men as male lodgers are by far the most abundant
Yes and in spite of the disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel
at this arrangement she must submit to it for a lodginghouse keeper
cannot have separate rooms for females To furnish a room however
meanly the poor workwoman must possess three or four shillings in ready
money But how save this sum out of weekly earnings of a couple of
florins which are scarcely sufficient to keep her from starving and
are still less sufficient to clothe her No no The poor wretch must
resign herself to this repugnant cohabitation and so gradually the
instinct of modesty becomes weakened the natural sentiment of chastity
that saved her from the gay life becomes extinct vice appears to be
the only means of improving her intolerable condition she yields
and the first man made of money who can afford a governess for his
children cries out against the depravity of the lower orders And
yet painful as the condition of the working woman is it is relatively
fortunate Should work fail her for one day two days what then Should
sickness comesickness almost always occasioned by unwholesome food
want of fresh air necessary attention and good rest sickness often
so enervating as to render work impossible though not so dangerous
as to procure the sufferer a bed in an hospitalwhat becomes of the
hapless wretches then The mind hesitates and shrinks from dwelling on
such gloomy pictures

This inadequacy of wages one terrible source only of so many evils and
often of so many vices is general especially among women and again
this is not private wretchedness but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch
It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a
week This poor workwoman then notwithstanding the advantages she
unknowingly enjoyed through Agricolas generosity lived very miserably
and her health already shattered was now wholly undermined by these
constant hardships Yet with extreme delicacy though ignorant of
the little sacrifice already made for her by Agricola Mother Bunch
pretended she earned more than she really did in order to avoid offers
of service which it would have pained her to accept because she knew
the limited means of Frances and her son and because it would have
wounded her natural delicacy rendered still more sensitive by so many
sorrows and humiliations

But singular as it may appear this deformed body contained a loving
and generous soula mind cultivated even to poetry and let us add
that this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin with whom she
had been brought up and who had naturally the gift This poor girl was
the first confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary
essays and when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found
in poetic reverie after a day of hard toil the workwoman gifted with
strong natural intelligence felt in her turn how great a resource
this would be to her in her lonely and despised condition

One day to Agricolas great surprise who had just read some verses to
her the sewinggirl with smiles and blushes timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony
perhaps but they were simple and affecting as a nonenvenomed
complaint entrusted to a friendly hearer From that day Agricola and she
held frequent consultations they gave each other mutual encouragement
but with this exception no one else knew anything of the girls
poetical essays whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of
weak intellect This soul must have been great and beautiful for in all
her unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her
hard lot her note was sad but gentledesponding but resigned it
was especially the language of deep tendernessof mournful sympathyof
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned like her to bear
the double burden of poverty and deformity Yet she often expressed
a sincere freespoken admiration of beauty free from all envy or
bitterness she admired beauty as she admired the sun But alas many
were the verses of hers that Agricola had never seen and which he was
never to see

The young mechanic though not strictly handsome had an open masculine
face was as courageous as kind possessed a noble glowing generous
heart a superior mind and a frank pleasing gayety of spirits The
young girl brought up with him loved him as an unfortunate creature
can love who dreading cruel ridicule is obliged to hide her affection
in the depths of her heart and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation
She did not seek to combat her love to what purpose should she do
so No one would ever know it Her well known sisterly affection for
Agricola explained the interest she took in all that concerned him so
that no one was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman
when in 1830 Agricola after fighting intrepidly for the peoples
flag was brought bleeding home to his mother Dagoberts son deceived
like others on this point had never suspected and was destined never
to suspect this love for him

Such was the poorlyclad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her sons supper

Is it you my poor love said she I have not seen you since morning
have you been ill Come and kiss me

The young girl kissed Agricolas mother and replied I was very busy
about some work mother I did not wish to lose a moment I have only
just finished it I am going down to fetch some charcoaldo you want
anything while Im out

No no my child thank you But I am very uneasy It is halfpast
eight and Agricola is not come home Then she added after a sigh He
kills himself with work for me Ah I am very unhappy my girl my sight
is quite going In a quarter of an hour after I begin working I cannot
see at allnot even to sew sacks The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted

Oh dont maam if Agricola heard you say that

I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me and that augments my
vexation Only I think that rather than leave me he gives up the
advantages that his fellowworkmen enjoy at Hardys his good and worthy
masterinstead of living in this dull garret where it is scarcely
light at noon he would enjoy like the other workmen at very little
expense a good light room warm in winter airy in summer with a view
of the garden And he is so fond of trees not to mention that this
place is so far from his work that it is quite a toil to him to get to
it

Oh when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue Mrs Baudoin said
Mother Bunch besides he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born M Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola in the
building put up for the workmen

Yes my child but then I must give up church I cant do that

Butbe easy I hear him said the hunchback blushing

A sonorous joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs

At least Ill not let him see that I have been crying said the good
mother drying her tears This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he hasI must not make it sad to him




CHAPTER XXIX AGRICOLA BAUDOIN

Our blacksmith poet a tall young man about fourandtwenty years of
age was alert and robust with ruddy complexion dark hair and eyes
and aquiline nose and an open expressive countenance His resemblance
to Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache
which he wore according to the fashion and a sharppointed imperial
covered his chin His cheeks however were shaven Olive color
velveteen trousers a blue blouse bronzed by the forge smoke a black
cravat tied carelessly round his muscular neck a cloth cap with
a narrow vizor composed his dress The only thing which contrasted
singularly with his working habiliments was a handsome purple flower
with silvery pistils which he held in his hand

Goodevening mother said he as he came to kiss Frances immediately

Then with a friendly nod he added Goodevening Mother Bunch

You are very late my child said Frances approaching the little
stove on which her sons simple meal was simmering I was getting very
anxious

Anxious about me or about my supper dear mother said Agricola
gayly The deuce you wont excuse me for keeping the nice little
supper waiting that you get ready for me for fear it should be spoilt
eh

So saying the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again

Have done you naughty boy youll make me upset the pan

That would be a pity mother for it smells delightfully Lets see
what it is

Wait half a moment

Ill swear now you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon Im so
fond of

Being Saturday of course said Frances in a tone of mild reproach

True rejoined Agricola exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch but talking of Saturday mother here are my wages

Thank ye child put the money in the cupboard

Yes mother

Oh dear cried the young sempstress just as Agricola was about
to put away the money what a handsome flower you have in your hand
Agricola I never saw a finer In winter too Do look at it Mrs
Baudoin

See there mother said Agricola taking the flower to her look
at it admire it and especially smell it You cant have a sweeter
perfume a blending of vanilla and orange blossom

Indeed it does smell nice child Goodness how handsome said
Frances admiringly where did you find it

Find it my good mother repeated Agricola smilingly do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
BriseMiche

How did you get it then inquired the sewing girl sharing in
Francess curiosity

Oh you would like to know Well Ill satisfy you and explain why
I came home so late for something else detained me It has been an
evening of adventures I promise you I was hurrying home when I heard
a low gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone it was just
about dusk and I could see a very pretty little dog scarce bigger than
my fist black and tan with long silky hair and ears that covered its
paws

Lost poor thing I warrant said Frances

Youve hit it I took up the poor thing and it began to lick my hands
Round its neck was a red satin ribbon tied in a large bow but as that
did not bear the masters name I looked beneath it and saw a small
collar made of a gold plate and small gold chains So I took a Lucifer
match from my baccobox and striking a light I read FRISKY belongs
to Hon Miss Adrienne de Cardoville No 7 Rue de Babylone

Why you were just in the street said Mother Bunch

Just so Taking the little animal under my arm I looked about me till
I came to a long garden wall which seemed to have no end and found a
small door of a summerhouse belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park for this garden looked just like a park So
looking up I saw No 7 newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide I rang and in a few minutes spent no doubt in observing me
through the bars for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through
the gate opened And now youll not believe a word I have to say

Why not my child

Because it seems like a fairy tale

A fairy tale said Mother Bunch as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history

For all the world it does I am quite astounded even now at my
adventure it is like the remembrance of a dream

Well let us have it said the worthy mother so deeply interested
that she did not perceive her sons supper was beginning to burn

First said the blacksmith smiling at the curiosity he had excited
a young lady opened the door to me but so lovely so beautifully
and gracefully dressed that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times Before I could say a word she exclaimed Ah
dear me sir you have brought back Frisky how happy Miss Adrienne
will be Come pray come in instantly she would so regret not having
an opportunity to thank you in person And without giving me time to
reply she beckoned me to follow her Oh dear mother it is quite out
of my power to tell you the magnificence I saw as I passed through
a small saloon partially lighted and full of perfume It would be
impossible The young woman walked too quickly A door openedOh such
a sight I was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of
gold and light crystal and flowers and amidst all this brilliancy
a young lady of extreme beautyideal beauty but she had red hair or
rather hair shining like gold Oh it was charming to look at I never
saw such hair before She had black eyes ruddy lips and her skin
seemed white as snow This is all I can recollect for as I said
before I was so dazzled I seemed to be looking through a veil
Madame said the young woman whom I never should have taken for
a ladysmaid she was dressed so elegantly here is Frisky This
gentleman found him and brought him back Oh sir said the young
lady with the golden hair in a sweet silvery voice what thanks I owe
you I am foolishly attached to Frisky Then no doubt concluding from
my dress that she ought to thank me in some other way than by words she
took up a silk purse and said to me though I must confess with some
hesitationNo doubt sir it gave you some trouble to bring my pet
back You have perhaps lost some valuable timeallow me She held
forth her purse

Oh Agricola said Mother Bunch sadly how people may be deceived

Hear the end and you will perhaps forgive the young lady Seeing by
my looks that the offer of the purse hurt me she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower and addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness that left me room to guess that she was
vexed at having wounded me she saidAt least sir you will accept
this flower

You are right Agricola said the girl smiling sadly an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way

Worthy young lady said Frances wiping her eyes how well she
understood my Agricola

Did she not mother But just as I was taking the flower without
daring to raise my eyes for notwithstanding the young ladys kind
manner there was something very imposing about her another handsome
girl tall and dark and dressed to the top of fashion came in and said
to the redhaired young lady He is here Madame She immediately rose
and said to me A thousand pardons sir I shall never forget that I
am indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure Pray remember on all
occasions my address and nameAdrienne de Cardoville Thereupon she
disappeared I could not find a word to say in reply The same young
woman showed me to the door and curtseyed to me very politely And
there I stood in the Rue de Babylone as dazzled and astonished as if I
had come out of an enchanted palace

Indeed my child it is like a fairy tale Is it not my poor girl

Yes maam said Mother Bunch in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe

What affected me most rejoined Agricola was that the young lady
on seeing her little dog did not forget me for it as many would
have done in her place and took no notice of it before me That shows
delicacy and feeling does it not Indeed I believe this young lady to
be so kind and generous that I should not hesitate to have recourse to
her in any important case

Yes you are right replied the sempstress more and more absent

The poor girl suffered extremely She felt no jealousy no hatred
towards this young stranger who from her beauty wealth and delicacy
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even
within the reach of a work girls vision but making an involuntary
comparison of this fortunate condition with her own the poor thing had
never felt more cruelly her deformity and poverty Yet such were the
humility and gentle resignation of this noble creature that the only
thing which made her feel illdisposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville
was the offer of the purse to Agricola but then the charming way in
which the young lady had atoned for her error affected the sempstress
deeply Yet her heart was ready to break She could not restrain her
tears as she contemplated the magnificent flowerso rich in color and
perfume which given by a charming hand was doubtless very precious to
Agricola

Now mother resumed the young man smilingly and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander you have had the cream of my
adventures first I have told you one of the causes of my delay and now
for the other Just now as I was coming in I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs his arms a beautiful peagreen Stopping me he said with
an air full of importance that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy Well what is that to you Daddy Loriot
said I are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green with which you are dyed up to the very elbows

But who could that man be Agricola said Frances

On my word mother I dont know and scarcely care I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot who chatters like a magpie to return to his cellar since
it could signify as little to him as to me whether a spy watched him
or not So saying Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack
containing his wages on a shelf in the cupboard

As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table Mother Bunch
recovering from her reverie filled a basin with water and taking
it to the blacksmith said to him in a gentle toneAgricolafor your
hands

Thank you little sister How kind you are Then with a most
unaffected gesture and tone he added There is my fine flower for your
trouble

Do you give it me cried the sempstress with emotion while a vivid
blush colored her pale and interesting face Do you give me this
handsome flower which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you And the poor thing repeated with growing astonishment Do
you give it to me

What the deuce should I do with it Wear it on my heart have it set as
a pin said Agricola smiling It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me I am delighted to
think I found her little dog and very happy to be able to give you this
flower since it pleases you You see the day has been a happy one

While Mother Bunch trembling with pleasure emotion and surprise took
the flower the young blacksmith washed his hands so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant Agricola
pointing out this change to the sempstress said to her in a whisper
laughingHeres cheap ink for us paperstainers I finished some
verses yesterday which I am rather satisfied with I will read them to
you

With this Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his
blouse while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers
and laid the flower against the side of it

Cant you ask for a towel said Frances shrugging her shoulders
instead of wiping your hands on your blouse

After being scorched all day long at the forge it will be all the
better for a little cooling tonight wont it Am I disobedient
mother Scold me then if you dare Come let us see you

Frances made no reply but placing her hands on either side of her
sons head so beautiful in its candor resolution and intelligence she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead

Come said she sit down you stand all day at your forge and it is
late

Soyour armchair again said AgricolaOur usual quarrel every
eveningtake it away I shall be quite as much at ease on another

No no You ought at least to rest after your hard toil

What tyranny said Agricola gayly sitting down Well I preach like
a good apostle but I am quite at ease in your armchair after all
Since I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries I have never had a
better seat

Frances Baudoin standing on one side of the table cut a slice of bread
for her son while Mother Bunch on the other filled his silver mug
There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures for him whom they loved so tenderly

Wont you sup with me said Agricola to the girl

Thank you Agricola replied the sempstress looking down I have
only just dined

Oh I only ask you for forms sakeyou have your whimswe can never
prevail on you to eat with usjust like mother she prefers dining all
alone and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it

Goodness child It is better for my health to dine early Well do you
find it nice

Nicecall it excellent Stockfish and parsnips Oh I am very fond of
stockfish I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman

This worthy lad on the contrary was but poorly refreshed after a hard
days toil with this paltry stewa little burnt as it had been too
during his story but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the
fast without complaining He affected to enjoy his meal and the good
woman accordingly observed with satisfaction

Oh I see you like it my dear boy Friday and Saturday next well have
some more

Thank you motheronly not two days together One gets tired
of luxuries you know And now let us talk of what we shall do
tomorrowSunday We must be very merry for the last few days you
seem very sad dear mother and I cant make it outI fancy you are not
satisfied with me

Oh my dear childyouthe pattern of

Well well Prove to me that you are happy then by taking a little
amusement Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us as you
did last time added Agricola bowing to Mother Bunch

The latter blushed and looked down her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief and she made no reply

I have the prayers to attend all day you know my dear child said
Frances to her son

Well in the evening then I dont propose the theatre but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing

I am obliged to you my son but that is a kind of theatre

Dear mother this is unreasonable

My dear child do I ever hinder others from doing what they like

True dear mother forgive me Well then if it should be fine we
will simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards It is
nearly three months since she went out with us and she never goes out
without us

No no go alone my child Enjoy your Sunday tis little enough

You know very well Agricola said the sempstress blushing up to the
eyes that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again

Why not madame May I ask without impropriety the cause of this
refusal said Agricola gayly

The poor girl smiled sadly and replied Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account Agricola

Forgive me said Agricola in a tone of sincere grief and he struck
his forehead vexedly

To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes but very rarely for she
observed punctilious discretion The girl had gone out with Agricola and
his mother Such occasions were indeed holidays for her Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl that
she might not do discredit to her friends The five or six days of
holidays thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret
formed the sum of her happy days

Taking their last walk a coarse vulgar man elbowed her so rudely
that the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror and the man
retorted it by sayingWhat are you rolling your hump in my way for
stoopid

Agricola like his father had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult Irritated at the vulgarity of this man Agricola
left his mothers arm to inflict on the brute who was of his own age
size and force two vigorous blows such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face The villain
attempted to return it and Agricola repeated the correction to the
amusement of the crowd and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again in order to save him any occasion of quarrel We may
conceive the blacksmiths regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstancemore painful alas for Mother Bunch
than Agricola could imagine for she loved him passionately and her
infirmity had been the cause of that quarrel Notwithstanding his
strength and resolution Agricola was childishly sensitive and
thinking how painful that thought must be to the poor girl a large tear
filled his eyes and holding out his hands he said in a brotherly
tone Forgive my heedlessness Come kiss me And he gave her thin
pale cheeks two hearty kisses

The poor girls lips turned pale at this cordial caress and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table

Come you forgive me do you not said Agricola

Yes yes she said trying to subdue her emotion but the
recollection of that quarrel pains meI was so alarmed on your account
if the crowd had sided with that man

Alas said Frances coming to the sewinggirls relief without
knowing it I was never so afraid in all my life

Oh mother rejoined Agricola trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard you have not much courage Oh my brave
father I cant believe he is really coming The very thought turns me
topsyturvy

Heaven grant he may come said Frances with a sigh

God grant it mother He will grant it I should think Lord knows you
have had masses enough said for his return

Agricola my child said Frances interrupting her son and shaking
her head sadly do not speak in that way Besides you are talking of
your father

Well Im in for it this evening Tis your turn now positively I am
growing stupid or going crazy Forgive me mother forgive Thats the
only word I can get out tonight You know that when I do let out on
certain subjects it is because I cant help it for I know well the
pain it gives you

You do not offend me my poor dear misguided boy

It comes to the same thing and there is nothing so bad as to offend
ones mother and with respect to what I said about fathers return I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it

But we have not heard from him for four months

You know mother in his letterthat is in the letter which he
dictated for you remember that with the candor of an old soldier
he told us that if he could read tolerably well he could not write
well in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him that
he expected to be in Paris about the end of January and would send us
word three or four days before by what road he expected to arrive
that I might go and meet him

True my child and February is come and no news yet

The greater reason why we should wait patiently But Ill tell you
more I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back
about the same time His last letter from America makes me hope so What
pleasure mother should all the family be together

Oh yes my child It would be a happy day for me

And that day will soon come trust me

Do you remember your father Agricola inquired Mother Bunch

To tell the truth I remember most his great grenadiers shako and
moustache which used to frighten me so that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor on the white facings of his uniform and the
shining handle of his sabre could pacify me could it mother But what
is the matter You are weeping

Alas poor Baudoin What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his agesixty and past Alas my child my heart breaks when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another

What do you mean

Alas I earn nothing now

Why whats become of me Isnt there a room here for you and for him
and a table for you too Only my good mother since we are talking of
domestic affairs added the blacksmith imparting increased tenderness
to his tone that he might not shock his mother when he and Gabriel
come home you wont want to have any more masses said and tapers
burned for them will you Well that saving will enable father to have
tobacco to smoke and his bottle of wine every day Then on Sundays we
will take a nice dinner at the eatinghouse

A knocking at the door disturbed Agricola

Come in said he Instead of doing so some one halfopened the
door and thrusting in an arm of a peagreen color made signs to the
blacksmith

Tis old Loriot the pattern of dyers said Agricola come in Daddy
no ceremony

Impossible my lad I am dripping with dye from head to foot I should
cover missuss floor with green

So much the better It will remind me of the fields I like so much

Without joking Agricola I must speak to you immediately

About the spy eh Oh be easy whats he to us

No I think hes gone at any rate the fog is so thick I cant see
him But thats not itcome come quickly It is very important said
the dyer with a mysterious look and only concerns you

Me only said Agricola with surprise What can it be

Go and see my child said Frances

Yes mother but the deuce take me if I can make it out

And the blacksmith left the room leaving his mother with Mother Bunch




CHAPTER XXX THE RETURN

In five minutes Agricola returned his face was pale and agitatedhis
eyes glistened with tears and his hands trembled but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion He stood at the door for
a moment as if too much affected to accost his mother

Francess sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her sons countenance had undergone

Well my childwhat is it she inquired

Before the blacksmith could reply Mother Bunch who had more
discernment exclaimed Goodness Agricolahow pale you are Whatever
is the matter

Mother said the artisan hastening to Frances without replying
to the sempstressmother expect news that will astonish you but
promise me you will be calm

What do you mean How you tremble Look at me Mother Bunch was
rightyou are quite pale

My kind mother and Agricola kneeling before Frances took both her
hands in hisyou mustyou do not knowbut

The blacksmith could not go on Tears of joy interrupted his speech

You weep my dear child Your tears alarm me What is the matteryou
terrify me

Oh no I would not terrify you on the contrary said Agricola
drying his eyesyou will be so happy But again you must try and
command your feelings for too much joy is as hurtful as too much
grief

What

Did I not say true when I said he would come

Father cried Frances She rose from her seat but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating and then she felt her strength fail Her son sustained her and
assisted her to sit down

Mother Bunch till now had stood discreetly apart witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother
But she now drew near timidly thinking she might be useful for Frances
changed color more and more

Come courage mother said the blacksmith now the shock is over
you have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father

My poor man after eighteen years absence Oh I cannot believe it
said Frances bursting into tears Is it true Is it indeed true

So true that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can I will
tell you when you may see him

Soonmay I not

Yes soon

But when will he arrive

He may arrive any minutetomorrowperhaps today

Today

Yes mother Well I must tell you allhe has arrived

Hehe is Frances could not articulate the word

He was downstairs just now Before coming up he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you

Oh heaven

And now cried the blacksmith in an accent of indescribable joyhe
is there waiting Oh mother for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myselfmy heart is bursting with joy And running
to the door he threw it open

Dagobert holding Rose and Blanche by the hand stood on the threshold
Instead of rushing to her husbands arms Frances fell on her knees
in prayer She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers and thus accepting her offerings During a second the actors
of this scene stood silent and motionless Agricola by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy which struggled violently with his affection
did not dare to fall on his fathers neck He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer

The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith they
understood each other The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affectiontheir veneration for that excellent woman
who in the fulness of her religious fervor forgot perhaps too much
the creature for the Creator

Rose and Blanche confused and affected looked with interest on the
kneeling woman while Mother Bunch shedding in silence tears of joy
at the thought of Agricolas happiness withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room feeling that she was a stranger and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting Frances rose and took a step towards
her husband who received her in his arms There was a moment of solemn
silence Dagobert and Frances said not a word Nothing could be heard
but a few sighs mingled with sighs of joy And when the aged couple
looked up their expression was calm radiant serene for the full and
complete enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a
feverish and violent agitation

My children said the soldier in tones of emotion presenting the
orphans to Frances who after her first agitation had surveyed them
with astonishment this is my good and worthy wife she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them

Then madame you will treat us as your children said Rose
approaching Frances with her sister

The daughters of General Simon cried Dagoberts wife more and more
astonished

Yes my dear Frances I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty but I will tell you that by and by

Poor little things One would take them for two angels exactly
alike said Frances contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration

Nowfor us cried Dagobert turning to his son

At last rejoined the latter

We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert
and his son and the crushing grip of their hands which Dagobert
interrupted only to look in Agricolas face while he rested his hands
on the young blacksmiths broad shoulders that he might see to more
advantage his frank masculine countenance and robust frame Then he
shook his hand again exclaiming Hes a fine fellowwell builtwhat
a goodhearted look he has

From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricolas happiness but
she feared that her presence till then unheeded would be an intrusion
She wished to withdraw unnoticed but could not do so Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche She had never seen anything
so winsome and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise Then their humble mourning revealing that they were poor
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them

Dear children They are cold their little hands are frozen and
unfortunately the fire is out said Frances She tried to warm the
orphans hands in hers while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection so long restrained

As soon as Frances said that the fire was out Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful as an excuse for her presence and going to the
cupboard where the charcoal and wood were kept she took some small
pieces and kneeling before the stove succeeded by the aid of a few
embers that remained in relighting the fire which soon began to draw
and blaze Filling a coffeepot with water she placed it on the stove
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noiseshe was naturally
so forgotten amidst the emotions of the scenethat Frances entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche only perceived the fire when she felt
its warmth diffusing round and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffeepot This phenomenonfire rekindling of itselfdid not astonish
Dagoberts wife then so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens for Dagobert as we have seen had not given her
notice of their arrival

Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door

Hallo theres Spoilsport said Dagobert letting in his dog he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too

The dog came in with a bound and in a second was quite at home After
having rubbed Dagoberts hand with his muzzle he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche and also Frances and Agricola but seeing that they
took but little notice of him he perceived Mother Bunch who stood
apart in an obscure corner of the room and carrying out the popular
saying the friends of our friends are our friends he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman who was just then forgotten by all By
a singular impulse this action affected the girl to tears she patted
her long thin white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog Then finding that she could be no longer useful for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her opened the door gently and went away
so discreetly that no one noticed her departure After this exchange
of mutual affection Dagobert his wife and son began to think of the
realities of life

Poor Frances said the soldier glancing at Rose and Blanche you did
not expect such a pretty surprise

I am only sorry my friend replied Frances that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room for
with Agricolas garret

It composes our mansion interrupted Dagobert there are handsomer
it must be confessed But be at ease these young ladies are drilled
into not being hard to suit on that score Tomorrow I and my boy will
go arm and arm and Ill answer for it he wont walk the more upright
and straight of the two and find out General Simons father at M
Hardys factory to talk about business

Tomorrow said Agricola to Dagobert you will not find at the
factory either M Hardy or Marshall Simons father

What is that you say my lad cried Dagobert hastily the Marshal

To be sure since 1830 General Simons friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny

Indeed cried Dagobert with emotion but that ought not to surprise
me for after all it is just and when the emperor said a thing the
least they can do is to let it abide But it goes all the same to my
heart it makes me jump again

Addressing the sisters he said Do you hear that my children You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France One
would hardly think it indeed to see you in this room my poor little
duchesses But patience all will go well Ah father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank eh my
lad

He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again for it was during the generals absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice But they expect Marshal Simon every
moment for the last letter from India announced his departure

At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other and their eyes
filled with tears

Heaven be praised These children rely on his return but why shall we
not find M Hardy and father Simon at the factory tomorrow

Ten days ago they went to examine and study an English mill
established in the south but we expect them back every day

The deuce thats vexing I relied on seeing the generals father to
talk over some important matters with him At any rate they know where
to write to him So tomorrow you will let him know my lad that his
granddaughters are arrived In the mean time children added the
soldier to Rose and Blanche my good wife will give you her bed and
you must put up with the chances of war Poor things they will not be
worse off here than they were on the journey

You know we shall always be well off with you and madame said Rose

Besides we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris
since here we are to find our father added Blanche

That hope gives you patience I know said Dagobert but no matter
After all you have heard about it you ought to be finely surprised my
children As yet you have not found it the golden city of your dreams
by any means But patience patience youll find Paris not so bad as
it looks

Besides said Agricola I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city

You are right Agricola said Rose with a smile you have indeed
guessed us

What do you know my name

Certainly Agricola we often talked about you with Dagobert and
latterly too with Gabriel added Blanche

Gabriel cried Agricola and his mother at the same time

Yes replied Dagobert making a sign of intelligence to the orphans
we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come and among other
things how we chanced to meet with Gabriel All I can now say is that
in his way he is quite as good as my boy I shall never be tired of
saying my boy and they ought to love each other like brothers Oh
my brave brave wife said Dagobert with emotion you did a good
thing poor as you were taking the unfortunate childand bringing him
up with your own

Dont talk so much about it my dear it was such a simple thing

You are right but Ill make you amends for it by and by Tis down to
your account in the mean time you will be sure to see him tomorrow
morning

My dear brother arrived too cried the blacksmith wholl say after
this that there are not days set apart for happiness How came you to
meet him father

Ill tell you all by and by about when and how we met Gabriel for
if you expect to sleep you are mistaken Youll give me half your room
and a fine chat well have Spoilsport will stay outside of this door
he is accustomed to sleep at the childrens door

Dear me love I think of nothing But at such a moment if you and
the young ladies wish to sup Agricola will fetch something from the
cookshop

What do you say children

No thank you Dagobert we are not hungry we are too happy

You will take a little wine and water sweetened nice and hot to warm
you a little my dear young ladies said Frances unfortunately I
have nothing else to offer you

You are right Frances the dear children are tired and want to go to
bed while they do so Ill go to my boys room and before Rose and
Blanche are awake I will come down and converse with you just to give
Agricola a respite

A knock was now heard at the door

It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her said Agricola

But I think she was here when my husband came in added Frances

Right mother and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder
she is so thoughtful But nonoit is not she who knocks so loud

Go and see who it is then Agricola

Before the blacksmith could reach the door a man decently dressed with
a respectable air entered the room and glanced rapidly round looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche

Allow me to observe sir said Agricola that after knocking you
might have waited till the door was opened before you entered Pray
what is your business

Pray excuse me sir said the man very politely and speaking slowly
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room I beg a thousand pardonsI
regret my intrusionI am ashamed

Well you ought to be sir said Agricola with impatience what do
you want

Pray sir does not Miss Soliveau a deformed needlewoman live here

No sir upstairs said Agricola

Really sir cried the polite man with low bows I am quite abroad
at my blunder I thought this was the room of that young person I
brought her proposals for work from a very respectable party

It is very late sir said Agricola with surprise But that young
person is as one of our family Call tomorrow you cannot see her to
night she is gone to bed

Then sir I again beg you to excuse

Enough sir said Agricola taking a step towards the door

I hope madame and the young ladies as well as this gent will be
assured that

If you go on much longer making excuses sir you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses and it is time this came to an end

Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola while Dagobert
rubbed his moustache with pride

What wit the boy has said he aside to his wife But that does not
astonish youyou are used to it

During this speech the ceremonious person withdrew having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters and to Agricola and
Dagobert

In a few minutes after Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret Just as the blacksmith
who preceded his father with a light passed before the door of Mother
Bunchs room the latter half concealed in the shade said to him
rapidly in a low tone

Agricola great danger threatens you I must speak to you

These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them but as Agricola stopped suddenly with a start the old
soldier said to him

Well boy what is it

Nothing father said the blacksmith turning round I feared I did
not light you well

Oh stand at ease about that I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night and the soldier not noticing his sons surprise went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night

On leaving the house after his inquiries about Mother Bunch the
over polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of BriseMiche Street He
advanced towards a hackneycoach drawn up on the Cloitre SaintMerry
Square

In this carriage lounged Rodin wrapped in a cloak

Well said he in an inquiring tone

The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoins by listening at the door I learnt that the sisters will
sleep with her in that room tonight the old man with gray moustache
will share the young blacksmiths room

Very well said Rodin

I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening
on the subject of the Bacchanal Queen I intend returning tomorrow to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by
the post about the young blacksmith

Do not fail And now you will call for me on Frances Baudoins
confessor late as it is you will tell him that I am waiting for him
at Rue du Milieu des Ursinshe must not lose a moment Do you come with
him Should I not be returned he will wait for me You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment

All shall be faithfully executed said the ceremonious man cringing
to Rodin as the coach drove quickly away




CHAPTER XXXI AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH

Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been
described the most profound silence reigned in the soldiers humble
dwelling A flickering light which played through two panes of glass
in a door betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep for
her gloomy recess without air or light was impenetrable to the rays
of day except by this door opening upon a narrow and obscure passage
connected with the roof A sorry bed a table an old portmanteau and a
chair so nearly filled this chilling abode that two persons could not
possibly be seated within it unless one of them sat upon the side of
the bed

The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water placed upon the table on a
linen cloth diffusing its sweet odor around and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet whose plastered walls gray and damp were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle The sempstress who
had taken off no part of her dress was seated upon her bedher looks
were downcast and her eyes full of tears She supported herself with
one hand resting on the bolster and inclining towards the door
listened with painful eagerness every instant hoping to hear the
footsteps of Agricola The heart of the young sempstress beat violently
her face usually very pale was now partially flushedso exciting was
the emotion by which she was agitated Sometimes she cast her eyes with
terror upon a letter which she held in her hand a letter that had
been delivered by post in the course of the evening and which had
been placed by the housekeeper the dyer upon the table while she
was rendering some trivial domestic services during the recognitions of
Dagobert and his family

After some seconds Mother Bunch heard a door very near her own softly
opened

There he is at last she exclaimed and Agricola immediately entered

I waited till my father went to sleep said the blacksmith in a low
voice his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness
But what is the matter my good sister How your countenance is
changed You weep What has happened About what danger would you speak
to me

Hush Read this said she her voice trembling with emotion while she
hastily presented to him the open letter Agricola held it towards the
light and read what follows

A person who has reasons for concealing himself but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin warns
you That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the
course of tomorrow

I exclaimed Agricola looking at Mother Bunch with an air of
stupefied amazement What is the meaning of all this

Read on quickly replied the sempstress clasping her hands

Agricola resumed reading scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyesThe song entitled Workingmen Freed has been declared
libellous Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy

Alas said the girl melting into tears now I see it all The man
who was lurking about below this evening who was observed by the dyer
was doubtless a spy lying in wait for you coming home

Nonsense exclaimed Agricola This accusation is quite ridiculous
Do not torment yourself I never trouble myself with politics My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy Am I to blame if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table

Read pray read said the other read on

If you wish it said Agricola I will no time is lost

He resumed the reading of the letter

A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit
in order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months
previous to trialan imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for
his mother whose sole support he is

A SINCERE FRIEND who is compelled to remain unknown

After a moments silence the blacksmith raised his head his
countenance resumed its serenity and laughing he said Reassure
yourself good Mother Bunch these jokers have made a mistake by trying
their games on me It is plainly an attempt at making an Aprilfool of
me before the time

Agricola for the love of heaven said the girl in a supplicating
tone treat not the warning thus lightly Believe in my forebodings
and listen to my advice

I tell you again my good girl replied Agricola that it is two
months since my song was published It is not in any way political
indeed if it were they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me

But said the other you forget that new events have arisen It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered in this very
neighborhood in the Rue des Prouvaires And continued she if the
verses though perhaps hitherto unnoticed have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot

Compromise me said Agricola my verses in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness To arrest me for that If so justice
would be but a blind noodle That she might grope her way it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrims staff to guide her
steps

Agricola resumed Mother Bunch overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment I conjure you to listen
to me No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor but
you do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers devoted as they are without hope to all the miseries of
life you recommend indeed only fraternity among men but your good
and noble heart vents its indignation at the same time against the
selfish and the wicked In fine you fervently hasten on with the ardor
of your wishes the emancipation of all the artisans who less fortunate
than you have not generous M Hardy for employer Say Agricola in
these times of trouble is there anything more necessary to compromise
you than that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession
of the persons who have been apprehended

Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of
an excellent creature who reasoned from her heart and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him

Perceiving that she had shaken him the sewinggirl went on to say And
then bear your fellowworkman Remi in recollection

Remi said Agricola anxiously

Yes resumed the sempstress a letter of his a letter in itself
quite insignificant was found in the house of a person arrested last
year for conspiracy and Remi in consequence remained a month in
prison

That is true but the injustice of his implication was easily shown
and he was set at liberty

Yes Agricola but not till he had lain a month in prison and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself
A month in prison Good heavens Agricola think of that and your
mother

These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola He took up the
letter and again read it attentively

And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house
proceeded she I constantly recall that circumstance which cannot be
naturally accounted for Alas what a blow it would be for your father
and poor mother who is incapable of earning anything Are you not
now their only resource Oh consider then what would become of them
without youwithout your labor

It would indeed be terrible said Agricola impatiently casting the
letter upon the table What you have said concerning Remi is too true
He was as innocent as I am yet an error of justice an involuntary
error though it be is not the less cruel But they dont commit a man
without hearing him

But they arrest him first and hear him afterwards said Mother Bunch
bitterly and then after a month or two they restore him his liberty
And if he have a wife and children whose only means of living is his
daily labor what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison They suffer hunger they endure cold and they weep

At these simple and pathetic words Agricola trembled

A month without work he said with a sad and thoughtful air And my
mother and father and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father Marshal Simon Oh you are
right That thought in spite of myself affrights me

Agricola exclaimed the girl impetuously suppose you apply to M
Hardy he is so good and his character is so much esteemed and honored
that if he offered bail for you perhaps they would give up their
persecution

Unfortunately replied Agricola M Hardy is absent he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon

After a silence of some time Agricola striving to surmount his fear
added But no I cannot give credence to this letter After all I had
rather await what may come Ill at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination for indeed my good sister whether
it be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself my working
for my family will be equally prevented

Alas that is true said the poor girl what is to be done Oh what
is to be done

My brave father said Agricola to himself if this misfortune happen
tomorrow what an awakening it will be for him who came here to sleep
so joyously The blacksmith buried his face in his hands

Unhappily Mother Bunchs fears were too wellfounded for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832 before and after the
Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy a very great number of arrests had been
made among the working classes in consequence of a violent reaction
against democratical ideas

Suddenly the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds A blush colored her features which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint grief and hope

Agricola you are saved

What say you he asked

The young lady so beautiful so good who gave you this flower she
showed it to the blacksmith who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer cannot but have a
generous heart You must apply to her

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself great tears rolled down her cheeks For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom
she idolized while she herself poor creature was powerless and
wretched

Do you think so exclaimed Agricola surprised But what could be done
with this young lady

Did she not say to you answered Mother Bunch Remember my name and
in all circumstances address yourself to me

She did indeed replied Agricola

This young lady in her exalted position ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you Go to her to
morrow morning tell her frankly what has happened and request her
support

But tell me my good sister what it is you wish me to do

Listen I remember that in former times my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison by becoming surety
for him It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence that she will be induced to become surety and after that
you will have nothing more to fear

My poor child said Agricola to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard

Believe me Agricola said the other sadly I would never counsel
what could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one and above alldo
you understandabove all in the eyes of this young lady I do not
propose that you should ask money from her but only that she should
give surety for you in order that you may have the liberty of
continuing at your employment so that the family may not be without
resources Believe me Agricola that such a request is in no respect
inconsistent with what is noble and becoming upon your part The heart
of the young lady is generous She will comprehend your position The
required surety will be as nothing to her while to you it will be
everything and will even be the very life to those who depend upon
you

You are right my good sister said Agricola with sadness and
dejection It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step If the
young lady consent to render me this service and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison I shall be prepared for every event But
no no added he rising Id never dare to make the request to her
What right have I to do so What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her when compared with that which I should solicit from her

Do you imagine then Agricola that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered by those previously received Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart I am it is
true but a lowly creature and ought not to compare myself with any
other person I am nothing and I can do nothing Nevertheless I am
sureyes Agricola I am surethat this young lady who is so very far
above me will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair
yes like me she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one and she will do with joy with happiness with thankfulness that
which I would do if alas I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets

In spite of herself she pronounced the last words with an expression
so heartbreakingthere was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature obscure and disdained infirm and miserable
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville the very type of
resplendent youth beauty and opulencethat Agricola was moved even to
tears and holding out one of his hands to the speaker he said to her
tenderly How very good you are how full of nobleness good feeling
and delicacy

Unhappily said the weeping girl I can do nothing more than advise

And your counsels shall be followed out my sister dear They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known Yes you have won me over
into making this experiment by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own

At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions If some poor creatures fatally
devoted to sufferings experience griefs of which the world knows
naught they sometimes too are cheered by humble and timid joys of
which the world is equally ignorant The least word of true tenderness
and affection which elevates them in their own estimation is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings habitually consigned not only to
hardships and to disdain but even to desolating doubts and distrust of
themselves

Then it is agreed that you will go tomorrow morning to this young
ladys house exclaimed Mother Bunch trembling with a newborn hope
And she quickly added at break of day Ill go down to watch at the
streetdoor to see if there be anything suspicious and to apprise you
of what I perceive

Good excellent girl exclaimed Agricola with increasing emotion

It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of
your father said the hunchback The quarter in which the young lady
dwells is so deserted that the mere going there will almost serve for
your present concealment

I think I hear the voice of my father said Agricola suddenly

In truth the little apartment was so near Agricolas garret that he
and the sempstress listening heard Dagobert say in the dark

Agricola is it thus that you sleep my boy Why my first sleep is
over and my tongue itches deucedly

Go quick Agricola said Mother Bunch your absence would disquiet
him On no account go out tomorrow morning before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious

Why Agricola you are not here resumed Dagobert in a louder voice

Here I am father said the smith while going out of the sempstresss
apartment and entering the garret to his father

I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated
lest its noise should disturb you

Thanks my boy but it is not noise that wakes me said Dagobert
gayly it is an appetite quite furious for a chat with you Oh my
dear boy it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father who has
not seen his son for eighteen years

Shall I light a candle father

No no that would be luxurious let us chat in the dark It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you tomorrow morning at daybreak It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice The door of Agricolas garret
being now closed Mother Bunch heard nothing more

The poor girl without undressing threw herself upon the bed and
closed not an eye during the night painfully awaiting the appearance of
day in order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola However
in spite of her vivid anxieties for the morrow she sometimes allowed
herself to sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy She compared
the conversation she had just had in the silence of night with the man
whom she secretly adored with what that conversation might have been
had she possessed some share of charms and beautyhad she been loved as
she loved with a chaste and devoted flame But soon sinking into belief
that she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion she
found consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola At the dawn
of day she rose softly and descended the staircase with little noise
in order to see if anything menaced Agricola from without




CHAPTER XXXII THE AWAKENING

The weather damp and foggy during a portion of the night became clear
and cold towards morning Through the glazed skylight of Agricolas
garret where he lay with his father a corner of the blue sky could be
seen

The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewinggirls For its sole ornament over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Berangerthat immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people and to sing their glories and their
reverses

Although the day had only begun to dawn Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude for renewed reflection had again increased his fears

The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests and the discovery of numerous copies
of Agricolas song in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot was in truth calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith His father however as we have already mentioned
suspected not his secret anguish Seated by the side of his son upon
the edge of their mean little bed the old soldier by break of day
had dressed and shaved with military care he now held between his hands
both those of Agricola his countenance radiant with joy and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy

You will laugh at me my dear boy said Dagobert to his son but I
wished the night to the devil in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day as I now see you But all in good time I have lost nothing
Here is another silliness of mine it delights me to see you wear
moustaches What a splendid horsegrenadier you would have made Tell
me have you never had a wish to be a soldier

I thought of mother

Thats right said Dagobert and besides I believe after all look
ye that the time of the sword has gone by We old fellows are now good
for nothing but to be put in a corner of the chimney Like rusty old
carbines we have had our day

Yes your days of heroism and of glory said Agricola with excitement
and then he added with a voice profoundly softened and agitated it is
something good and cheering to be your son

As to the good I know nothing of that replied Dagobert but as for
the cheering it ought to be so for I love you proudly And I think
this is but the beginning What say you Agricola I am like the
famished wretches who have been some days without food It is but by
little and little that they recover themselves and can eat Now you
may expect to be tasted my boy morning and evening and devoured
during the day No I wish not to think thatnot all the dayno that
thought dazzles and perplexes me and I am no longer myself

These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola He
believed that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with
which he was menaced

Well continued Dagobert you are quite happy M Hardy is always
good to you

Oh replied Agricola there is none in the world better or more
equitable and generous If you knew what wonders he has brought about
in his factory Compared to all others it is a paradise beside the
stithies of Lucifer

Indeed said Dagobert

You shall see resumed Agricola what welfare what joy what
affection are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs
who work with an ardent pleasure

This M Hardy of yours must be an outandout magician said Dagobert

He is father a very great magician He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive As for the pleasure over and above good wages
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work And that
is not all he has caused large handsome buildings to be erected in
which all his workpeople find at less expense than elsewhere cheerful
and salubrious lodgings in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association But you shall seeI repeatyou shall see

They have good reason to say that Paris is the region of wonders
observed Dagobert

Well behold me here again at last never more to quit you nor good
mother

No father we will never separate again said Agricola stifling a
sigh My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you
have suffered

Suffered exclaimed Dagobert who the deuce has suffered Look me
well in the face and see if I have a look of suffering Bombs and
bayonets Since I have put my foot here I feel myself quite a young man
again You shall see me march soon I bet that I tire you out You must
rig yourself up something extra Lord how they will stare at us I
wager that in beholding your black moustache and my gray one folks will
say behold father and son But let us settle what we are to do with the
day You will write to the father of Marshal Simon informing him the
his granddaughters have arrived and that it is necessary that he
should hasten his return to Paris for he has charged himself with
matters which are of great importance for them While you are writing
I will go down to say goodmorning to my wife and to the dear little
ones We will then eat a morsel Your mother will go to mass for I
perceive that she likes to be regular at that the good soul no great
harm if it amuse her and during her absence we will make a raid
together

Father said Agricola with embarrassment this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you

How out of your power said Dagobert recollect this is Monday

Yes father said Agricola hesitatingly but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop to finish a job that is required
in a hurry If I fail to do so I shall inflict some injury upon M
Hardy But Ill soon be at liberty

That alters the case said Dagobert with a sigh of regret I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning but it must
be deferred in favor of your work It is sacred since it is that which
sustains your mother Nevertheless it is vexatious devilish vexatious
And yet noI am unjust See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness I growl like a true grumbler at a walk being put
off for a few hours I do this I who during eighteen years have only
hoped to see you once more without daring to reckon very much upon
it Oh I am but a silly old fool Vive lamour et cogniI meanmy
Agricola And to console himself the old soldier gayly slapped his
sons shoulder

This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized
Now that I have recovered myself said Dagobert laughing let
us speak of business Know you where I find the addresses of all the
notaries in Paris

I dont know but nothing is more easy than to discover it

My reason is resumed Dagobert that I sent from Russia by post and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here
some important papers to a Parisian notary As it was my duty to see
this notary immediately upon my arrival I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio of which however I have been robbed during my
journey and as I have forgotten his devil of a name it seems to me
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries I might recollect
it

Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension

His father who at the sound of the knocking turned round his head had
not perceived his emotion and said with a loud voice Come in The
door opened It was Gabriel He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat

To recognize his brother by adoption and to throw himself into his
arms were two movements performed at once by Agricolaas quick as
thoughtMy brother exclaimed Agricola

Agricola cried Gabriel

Gabriel responded the blacksmith

After so long an absence said the one

To behold you again rejoined the other

Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary
while they were locked in a close embrace

Dagobert moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments felt his
eyes become moist There was something truly touching in the affection
of the young menin their hearts so much alike and yet of characters
and aspects so very differentfor the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of
Gabriel

I was forewarned by my father of your arrival said the blacksmith at
length I have been expecting to see you and my happiness has been
a hundred times the greater because I have had all the pleasures of
hoping for it

And my good mother asked Gabriel in affectionately grasping the
hands of Dagobert I trust that you have found her in good health

Yes my brave boy replied Dagobert and her health will have become
a hundred times better now that we are all together Nothing is so
healthful as joy Then addressing himself to Agricola who forgetting
his fear of being arrested regarded the missionary with an expression
of ineffable affection Dagobert added

Let it be remembered that with the soft cheek of a young girl
Gabriel has the courage of a lion I have already told with what
intrepidity he saved the lives of Marshal Simons daughters and tried
to save mine also

But Gabriel what has happened to your forehead suddenly exclaimed
Agricola who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary

Gabriel having thrown aside his hat on entering was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet pale countenance and the round scar
which extended from one eyebrow to the other was therefore distinctly
visible

In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion and of the
exciting events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky
coast near Cardoville House Dagobert during the short interview he
then had with Gabriel had not perceived the scar which seamed the
forehead of the young missionary Now partaking however of the
surprise of his son Dagobert said

Aye indeed how came this scar upon your brow

And on his hands too see dear father exclaimed the blacksmith
with renewed surprise while he seized one of the hands which the young
priest held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears

Gabriel my brave boy explain this to us added Dagobert who
has wounded you thus and in his turn taking the other hand of the
missionary he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds and then added In Spain one of my comrades was found and
taken down alive from a cross erected at the junction of several roads
upon which the monks had crucified and left him to die of hunger
thirst and agony Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands exactly
similar to this upon your hand

My father is right exclaimed Agricola It is evident that your
hands have been pierced through My poor brother and Agricola became
grievously agitated

Do not think about it said Gabriel reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the
Rocky Mountains they crucified me and they had begun to scalp me when
Providence snatched me from their hands

Unfortunate youth said Dagobert without arms then You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection

It is not for such as me to carry arms said Gabriel sweetly smiling
and we are never accompanied by any escort

Well but your companions those who were along with you how came it
that they did not defend you impetuously asked Agricola

I was alone my dear brother

Alone

Yes alone without even a guide

You alone unarmed in a barbarous country exclaimed Dagobert
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing

It was sublime said the young blacksmith and poet

The Christian faith said Gabriel with mild simplicity cannot be
implanted by force or violence It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages

But when persuasions fail said Agricola

Why then dear brother one has but to die for the belief that is
in him pitying those who have rejected it and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind

There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos

Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a
heroism thus calm and resigned and the old soldier as well as his
son now contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled
admiration and respect

Gabriel entirely free from the affection of false modesty seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends and he therefore said to Dagobert What ails you

What ails me exclaimed the brave old soldier with great emotion
After having been for thirty years in the wars I had imagined myself
to be about as courageous as any man And now I find I have a master
And that master is yourself

I said Gabriel what do you mean What have I done

Thunder dont you know that the brave wounds there the veteran
took with transport both of Gabriels hands that these wounds are
as gloriousare more glorious than ourthan all ours as warriors by
profession

Yes yes my father speaks truth exclaimed Agricola and he added
with enthusiasm Oh for such priests How I love them How I
venerate them How I am elevated by their charity their courage their
resignation

I entreat you not to extol me thus said Gabriel with embarrassment

Not extol you replied Dagobert Hanged if I shouldnt When I have
gone into the heat of action did I rush into it alone Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer Were not my comrades there along
with me In default of true courage had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle the smell of the gunpowder the flourishes
of the trumpets the thundering of the cannon the ardor of my horse
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present with his eye upon every
onethe emperor who in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon as plaster for the wound
Thanks to all these causes I passed for game Fair enough But are
you not a thousand times more game than I my brave boy going alone
unarmed to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attackedwe who fought in whole squadrons supported by
artillery bombshells and caseshot

Excellent father cried Agricola how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice

Oh dear brother said Gabriel his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple

Natural said the veteran soldier yes natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper but that temper is rare

Oh yes very rare said Agricola for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all Most bravely did you seek almost certain death
alone bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood They seized you tortured you and you await
death and partly endure it without complaint without remonstrance
without hatred without anger without a wish for vengeance forgiveness
issuing from your mouth and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips
and this in the depths of forests where no one could witness your
magnanimitynone could behold youand without other desire after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe My father is right by Jove can you still contend that you are
not as brave as he

And besides too resumed Dagobert the dear boy did all that for
a thankless paymaster for it is true Agricola that his wounds will
never change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a
bishop

I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be said Gabriel to
Dagobert smiling meekly If I am deemed worthy a great recompense
awaits me on high

As to all that my boy said Dagobert I do not understand it and I
will not argue about it I maintain it that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform

But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel said Agricola and if you did know dear father how
much virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the
priesthood insolently call the inferior clergythe unseen merit and
the blind devotedness to be found amongst worthy but obscure country
curates who are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by
the lordly lawnsleeves Like us those poor priests are worthy laborers
in their vocation and for them also all generous hearts ought to
demand enfranchisement Sons of common people like ourselves and
useful as we are justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us
Do I say right Gabriel You will not contradict it for you have told
me that your ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy
because you understand the good that you could work within it

My desire is still the same said Gabriel sadly but unfortunately
and then as if he wished to escape from a painful thought and to
change the conversation he addressing himself to Dagobert added
Believe me be more just than to undervalue your own courage by
exalting mine Your courage must be very greatvery great for after
a battle the spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a
generous and feeling heart We at least though we may be killed do
not kill

At these words of the missionary the soldier drew himself up erect
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment and said This is most
surprising

What is inquired Agricola

What Gabriel has just told us replied Dagobert brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years Listen my children more than once on the
night after a general engagement I have been mounted as a
videttealoneby nightamid the moonlight on the field of battle
which remained in our possession and upon which lay the bodies of
seven or eight thousand of the slain amongst whom were mingled the
slaughtered remains of some of my old comrades and then this sad scene
when the profound silence has restored me to my senses from the thirst
for bloodshed and the delirious whirling of my sword intoxicated
like the rest I have said to myself for what have these men been
killedFOR WHATFOR WHAT But this feeling well understood as it
was hindered me not on the following morning when the trumpets again
sounded the charge from rushing once more to the slaughter But the
same thought always recurred when my arm became weary with carnage and
after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my horse I have said to myself
I have killedkilledkilled and FOR WHAT

The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past

Alas said Gabriel to him all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments when the intoxication of glory has subsided and
man is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom

And that should prove my brave boy rejoined Dagobert that you are
greatly better than I for those noble instincts as you call them have
never abandoned you     But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you

At this question of Dagobert Gabriel started and reddened so visibly
that the soldier said to him If you ought not or cannot answer my
request let us say no more about it

I have nothing to conceal either from you or from my brother replied
the missionary with altered voice Only it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself

How is that asked Agricola with surprise

Surely said Gabriel reddening more deeply I must have been
deceived by a fallacy of my senses during that abstracted moment in
which I awaited death with resignation My enfeebled mind in spite of
me must have been cheated by an illusion or that which to the present
hour has remained inexplicable would have been more slowly developed
and I should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange
woman

Dagobert while listening to the missionary was perfectly amazed for
he also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic

Of what woman do you speak asked Agricola

Of her who saved me was the reply

A woman saved you from the hands of the savages said Dagobert

Yes replied Gabriel though absorbed in his reflections a woman
young and beautiful

And who was this woman asked Agricola

I know not When I asked her she replied I am the sister of the
distressed

And whence came she Whither went she asked Dagobert singularly
interested

I go wheresoever there is suffering she replied answered
the missionary and she departed going towards the north of
Americatowards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow
where the nights are without end

As in Siberia said Dagobert who had become very thoughtful

But resumed Agricola addressing himself to Gabriel who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance

The missionary was about to reply to the last question when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment which renewed
the fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother Agricola said a sweet voice outside the door I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible

The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunchs voice and opened the door
But the young sempstress instead of entering drew back into the dark
passage and said with a voice of anxiety Agricola it is an hour
since broad day and you have not yet departed How imprudent I have
been watching below in the street until now and have seen nothing
alarming but they may come any instant to arrest you Hasten I conjure
you your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville Not a minute
should be lost

Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel I should have been gone
But I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with
him

Gabriel here said Mother Bunch with sweet surprise for as has been
stated she had been brought up with him and Agricola

Yes answered Agricola for half an hour he has been with my father
and me

What happiness I shall have in seeing him again said the sewinggirl
He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep Your
mother has requested me to give you this letter for your father She has
just received it

Thanks

Well resumed Mother Bunch now that you have seen Gabriel do not
delay long Think what a blow it would be for your father if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu

You are right said Agricola it is indispensable that I should
departwhile near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety my fears were
forgotten

Go quickly then and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return quite at ease both as to
yourself and us

True a very few minutes more and Ill come down

I return to watch at the door If I perceive anything Ill come up
again to apprise you But pray do not delay

Be easy good sister Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase
to resume her watch at the street door and Agricola reentered his
garret Dear father he said to Dagobert my mother has just received
this letter and she requests you to read it

Very well read it for me my boy And Agricola read as follows

MADAMEI understand that your husband has been charged by General
Simon with an affair of very great importance Will you as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moments delay I am instructed to deliver to himself and
to no other person some documents indispensable to the interests of
General Simon

 DURAND Notary at Chartres

Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment and said to him Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris

Perhaps father said Agricola this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers and whose address you have lost

But his name was not Durand and I distinctly recollect that his
address was Paris not Chartres And besides said the soldier
thoughtfully if he has some important documents why didnt he
transmit them to me

It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible said Agricola secretly rejoiced that this circumstance
would withdraw his father for about two days during which time his
Agricolas fate would be decided in one way or other

Your counsel is good replied his father

This thwarts your intentions in some degree asked Gabriel

Rather my lads for I counted upon passing the day with you However
duty before everything Having come happily from Siberia to Paris
it is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres when it is
required on an affair of importance In twice twentyfour hours I shall
be back again But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres today Luckily I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife
and Gabriel their angel as they call him will be here to keep them
company

That is unfortunately impossible said the missionary sadly This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit

A farewell visit Now exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once

Alas yes

You start already on another mission said Dagobert surely it is not
possible

I must answer no question upon this subject said Gabriel suppressing
a sigh but from now for some time I cannot and ought not come
again into this house

Why my brave boy resumed Dagobert with emotion there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint of oppression I know
something of men He you call superior whom I saw for some moments
after the shipwreck at Cardoville Castle has a bad look and I am sorry
to see you enrolled under such a commander

At Cardoville Castle exclaimed Agricola struck with the identity
of the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck

Yes my boy why does that astonish you asked Dagobert

Nothing father but were the owners of the castle there at the time

No for the steward when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris

What a singular coincidence thought Agricola if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name

This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had
made to Mother Bunch he said to Dagobert Dear father excuse me but
it is already late and I ought to be in the workshop by eight oclock

That is too true my boy Let us go This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres Embrace me once more and take care of yourself

Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel the
latter had continued pensive At the moment when Agricola approached
him to shake hands and to bid him adieu the missionary said to him
solemnly with a grave voice and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier My dear brother one word more I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you and of you also my father permit me so to call
you added Gabriel with emotion as he turned round to Dagobert

How you speak thus to us exclaimed Agricola what is the matter

Yes replied Gabriel I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honorof two men of resolutionand I can reckon upon you twocan I
not At any hour on whatever day it may be upon a word from me will
you come

Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence astonished at the
accents of the missionary Agricola felt an oppression of the heart If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance
what could be done

At every hour by night or by day my brave boy you may depend upon
us said Dagobert as much surprised as interestedYou have a father
and a brother make your own use of them

Thanks thanks said Gabriel you set me quite at ease

Ill tell you what resumed the soldier were it not for your
priests robe I should believe from the manner in which you have
spoken to us that you are about to be engaged in a duelin a mortal
combat

In a duel said Gabriel starting Yes it may be a dueluncommon
and fearfulat which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as
youA FATHER and A BROTHER

Some instants afterwards Agricola whose anxiety was continually
increasing set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville to which we now beg leave to take the reader




CHAPTER XXXIII THE PAVILION

Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone
in Paris Nothing could be more severe more imposing or more
depressing than the aspect of this old mansion Several immense windows
filled with small squares of glass painted a grayish white increased
the sombre effect of the massive layers of huge stones blackened by
time of which the fabric was composed

This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century It was
surmounted in front by a pediment it had an elevated ground floor
which was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone
steps One of the fronts looked on an immense courtyard on each side
of which an arcade led to the vast interior departments The other front
overlooked the garden or rather park of twelve or fifteen roods and
on this side wings approaching the principal part of the structure
formed a couple of lateral galleries Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion

This extension was a Pompadour summerhouse built in the form of a
rotunda with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection It presented in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut a profusion of endives knots of ribbons garlands
of flowers and chubby cupids This pavilion inhabited by Adrienne
de Cardoville was composed of a ground floor which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps A small vestibule led to a circular hall
lighted from the roof Four principal apartments met here and ranges of
smaller rooms concealed in the upper story served for minor purposes

These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused or
transformed into irregular conservatories but by an uncommon exception
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed and
the entire structure repaired The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble and its renovated coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other
extremity of an extensive lawn on which were planted here and there
gigantic clumps of verdant trees

The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert with the daughters of Marshal Simon in
the Rue BriseMiche The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summerhouse The door in the vestibule opened and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature or rather upon
two charming creatures for the second one though filling a modest
place in the scale of creation was not less distinguished by beauty of
its own which was very striking In plain terms two individuals one of
them a young girl and the other a tiny English dog of great beauty
of that breed of spaniels called King Charless made their appearance
under the peristyle of the rotunda The name of the young girl was
Georgette the beautiful little spaniels was Frisky Georgette was in
her eighteenth year Never had Florine or Manton never had a ladys
maid of Marivaux a more mischievous face an eye more quick a smile
more roguish teeth more white cheeks more roseate figure more
coquettish feet smaller or form smarter attractive and enticing
Though it was yet very early Georgette was carefully and tastefully
dressed A tiny Valenciennes cap with flaps and flapband of half
peasant fashion decked with rosecolored ribbons and stuck a little
backward upon bands of beautiful fair hair surrounded her fresh and
piquant face a robe of gray levantine and a cambric neckkerchief
fastened to her bosom by a large tuft of rosecolored ribbons displayed
her figure elegantly rounded a hollands apron white as snow trimmed
below by three large hems surmounted by a Vandykerow encircled her
waist which was as round and flexible as a reed her short plain
sleeves edged with bone lace allowed her plump arms to be seen which
her long Swedish gloves reaching to the elbow defended from the rigor
of the cold When Georgette raised the bottom of her dress in order to
descend more quickly the steps she exhibited to Friskys indifferent
eyes a beautiful ankle and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine
leg encased in white silk and a charming little foot in a laced
halfboot of Turkish satin When a blonde like Georgette sets herself
to be ensnaring when vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet
tender blue when a joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin
she is more resistless for the conquest of everything before her than a
brunette

This bewitching and nimble ladysmaid who on the previous evening
had introduced Agricola to the pavilion was first waiting woman to
the Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier

Frisky so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith uttered
weak but joyful barks and bounded ran and frolicked upon the turf
She was not much bigger than ones fist her curled hair of lustrous
black shone like ebony under the broad red satin ribbon which
encircled her neck her paws fringed with long silken fur were of
a bright and fiery tan as well as her muzzle the nose of which was
inconceivably pug her large eyes were full of intelligence and her
curly ears so long that they trailed upon the ground Georgette seemed
to be as brisk and petulant as Frisky and shared her sportivenessnow
scampering after the happy little spaniel and now retreating in order
to be pursued upon the greensward in her turn All at once at the sight
of a second person who advanced with deliberate gravity Georgette
and Frisky were suddenly stopped in their diversion The little King
Charles some steps in advance of Georgette faithful to her name
and bold as the devil held herself firmly upon her nervous paws and
fiercely awaited the coming up of the enemy displaying at the same time
rows of little teeth which though of ivory were none the less pointed
and sharp The enemy consisted of a woman of mature age accompanied by
a very fat dog of the color of coffee and milk his tail was twisted
like a corkscrew he was potbellied his skin was sleek his neck was
turned little to one side he walked with his legs inordinately spread
out and stepped with the air of a doctor His black muzzle quarrelsome
and scowling showed two fangs sallying forth and turning up from the
left side of the mouth and altogether he had an expression singularly
forbidding and vindictive This disagreeable animal a perfect type of
what might be called a churchgoers pug answered to the name of My
Lord His mistress a woman of about fifty years of age corpulent and
of middle size was dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of
Georgette was gay and showy It consisted of a brown robe a black silk
mantle and a hat of the same dye The features of this woman might
have been agreeable in her youth and her florid cheeks her correct
eyebrows her black eyes which were still very lively scarcely
accorded with the peevish and austere physiognomy which she tried to
assume This matron of slow and discreet gait was Madame Augustine
Grivois first woman to the Princess SaintDizier Not only did the age
the face and the dress of these two women present a striking contrast
but the contrast extended itself even to the animals which attended
them There were similar differences between Frisky and My Lord as
between Georgette and Mrs Grivois When the latter perceived the
little King Charles she could not restrain a movement of surprise
and repugnance which escaped not the notice of the young ladys maid
Frisky who had not retreated one inch since the apparition of My
Lord regarded him valiantly with a look of defiance and even advanced
towards him with an air so decidedly hostile that the cur though
thrice as big as the little King Charles uttered a howl of distress
and terror and sought refuge behind Mrs Grivois who bitterly said to
Georgette

It seems to me miss that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus and setting him upon mine

It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but
ugly animal from similar alarms that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday by driving her into the street through the little garden
gate But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de
Babylone and brought her back to my mistress However continued
Georgette to what madame do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this
morning

I am commanded by the Princess replied Mrs Grivois unable to
conceal a smile of triumphant satisfaction immediately to see Miss
Adrienne It regards a very important affair which I am to communicate
only to herself

At these words Georgette became purple and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude which happily escaped Grivois who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect and Georgette having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion firmly answered Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day

That is very possible but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt you will do well if you please miss to
awaken your mistress immediately

My mistress is subject to no ones orders in her own house and I will
not disturb her till midday in pursuance of her commands replied
Georgette

Then I shall go myself said Mrs Grivois

Florine and Hebe will not admit you Indeed here is the key of the
saloon and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered

How do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess

Yes I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress

Ah such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece said the matron with affected grief Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunts orders and she is surrounded by young harebrained
persons who from the first dawn of morning dress themselves out as if
for ballgoing

Oh madame how came you to revile dress who were formerly the
greatest coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the
Princesss women At least that is what is still spoken of you in the
hotel as having been handed down from time out of mind by generation
to generation even unto ours

How from generation to generation do you mean to insinuate that I am
a hundred years old Miss Impertinence

I speak of the generations of waitingwomen for except you it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princesss house who
has too many tempers for the poor girls

I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees

However said Georgette if one wished to speak ill of

Do you dare

No longer ago than last night at half past eleven oclock

Last night

A fourwheeler continued Georgette stopped at a few paces from the
house A mysterious personage wrapped up in a cloak alighted from it
and directly tapped not at the door but on the glass of the porters
lodge window and at one oclock in the morning the cab was still
stationed in the street waiting for the mysterious personage in
the cloak who doubtless during all that time was as you say
pronouncing the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees

Whether Mrs Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess SaintDizier by Rodin for he was the man in the cloak in the
middle of the night after he had become certain of the arrival in
Paris of General Simons daughters or whether Mrs Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit she replied shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully I know not what you mean madame I have
not come here to listen to your impertinent stuff Once again I ask
youwill you or will you not introduce me to the presence of Miss
Adrienne

I repeat madame that my mistress sleeps and that she has forbidden
me to enter her bedchamber before midday

This conversation took place at some distance from the summerhouse
at a spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand
avenue terminating in trees arranged in form of a V All at once
Mrs Grivois extending her hand in that direction exclaimed Great
heavens is it possible what have I seen

What have you seen said Georgette turning round

What have I seen repeated Mrs Grivois with amazement

Yes what was it

Miss Adrienne

Where asked Georgette

I saw her run up the porch steps I perfectly recognized her by her
gait by her hat and by her mantle To come home at eight oclock in
the morning cried Mrs Grivois it is perfectly incredible

See my lady Why you came to see her and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter and then said Oh I understand you wish to outdo
my story of the fourwheeler last night It is very neat of you

I repeat said Mrs Grivois that I have this moment seen

Oh adone Mrs Grivois if you speak seriously you are mad

I am mad am I because I have a pair of good eyes The little gate
that opens on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion
It is by that door doubtless that mademoiselle has reentered
Oh what shameful conduct what will the Princess say to it Ah
her presentiments have not yet been mistaken See to what her weak
indulgence of her nieces caprices has led her It is monstrousso
monstrous that though I have seen her with my own eyes still I can
scarcely believe it

Since youve gone so far maam I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady in order that you may convince yourself by
your own senses that your eyes have deceived you

Oh you are very cunning my dear but not more cunning than I You
propose my going now Yes yes I believe you you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment

But madame I assure you

All that I can say to you is this that neither you nor Florine nor
Hebe shall remain here twentyfour hours The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal for I shall immediately inform her of what
has passed To go out in the night Reenter at eight oclock in the
morning Why I am all in a whirl Certainly if I had not seen it with
my own eyes I could not have believed it Still it is only what was to
be expected It will astonish nobody Assuredly not All those to whom I
am going to relate it will say I am quite sure that it is not at all
astonishing Oh what a blow to our respectable Princess What a blow
for her

Mrs Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion followed by her
fat pug who appeared to be as embittered as herself

Georgette active and light ran on her part towards the pavilion in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs Grivois had seen her or
fancied she had seen her furtively enter by the little garden gate




CHAPTER XXXIV ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET

About an hour had elapsed since Mrs Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville reenter in the morning the extension
of SaintDizier House

It is for the purpose not of excusing but of rendering intelligible
the following scenes that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of
Miss de Cardoville

This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed and to
an insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form feel not more than
Adrienne did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty
always excites in the chosen favorites of nature

And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady
loved to gratify the harmonious modulations of song the melody of
instruments the cadences of poetry afforded her infinite pleasures
while a harsh voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful
impression or one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily
experienced from the sight of a hideous object Passionately fond of
flowers too and of their sweet scents there are some perfumes which
she enjoyed equally with the delights of music or those of plastic
beauty It is necessary alas to acknowledge one enormity Adrienne was
dainty in her food She valued more than any one else the fresh pulp
of handsome fruit the delicate savor of a golden pheasant cooked to a
turn and the odorous cluster of a generous vine

But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them a fault from which indeed she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste

The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others

Her devotion to grace elegance and physical beauty had led her also
to the adoration of moral beauty for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances those which
are in themselves the most ugly are ennobled on the contrary by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments

In a word Adrienne was the most complete the most ideal
personification of SENSUALITYnot of vulgar ignorant non intelligent
mistaken sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit
or by the necessity for gross and illregulated enjoyments but that
exquisite sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the
soul

The independence of this young ladys character was extreme Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position
above all things were revolting to her and she had the hardihood
to resolve to withdraw herself from them She was a woman the most
womanish that it is possible to imaginea woman in her timidity as well
as in her audacitya woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of
men as well as in her intense disposition to selfdevoting herself
madly even and blindly to him who should merit such a devotion from
hera woman whose piquant wit was occasionally paradoxicala superior
woman in brief who entertained a wellgrounded disdain and contempt
for certain men either placed very high or greatly adulated whom she
had from time to time met in the drawingroom of her aunt the Princess
SaintDizier when she resided with her

These indispensable explanations being given we usher the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville who had just come out of the
bath

It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century in some palace of Florence or Bologna than in
Paris in the Faubourg SaintGermain in the month of February 1832

Adriennes dressingroom was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty in gratitude to the
Maker who has lavished so many charms upon woman not to be neglected by
her or to cover and conceal them with ashes or to destroy them by
the contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth but in order
that with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is
endowed she may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and
all the splendors of apparel so as to glorify the divine work of her
own perfections in the eyes of all Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment through one of those double windows contrived
for the preservation of heat so happily imported from Germany The
walls of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness the
depth of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great That of
Adriennes dressingroom was closed on the outside by a sash containing
a single large pane of plate glass and within by another large plate
of ground glass In the interval or space of about three feet left
between these two transparent enclosures there was a case or box filled
with furze mould whence sprung forth climbing plants which directed
round the ground glass formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers A
garnet damask tapestry rich with harmoniously blended arabesques in
the purest style covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color
was extended over the floor and this sombre ground presented by the
floor and walls marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious
ornaments and decorations of the chamber

Under the window opposite to the south was placed Adriennes dressing
case a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith Upon a large
tablet of lapislazuli there were scattered boxes of jewels their
lids precisely enamelled several scent boxes of rock crystal and other
implements and utensils of the toilet some formed of shells some of
motherofpearl and others of ivory covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste Two large figures modelled in silver with antique
purity supported an oval swing mirror which had for its rim in place
of a frame curiously carved a fresh garland of natural flowers renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball

Two enormous Japanese vases of purple and gold three feet each in
diameter were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet and
filled with camellias ibiscures and cape jasmine in full flower
formed a sort of grove diversified with the most brilliant colors At
the farther end of the apartment opposite the casement was to be seen
surrounded by another mass of flowers a reduction in white marble of
the enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe the more chaste ideal of
graceful modesty and youthful beauty

Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures A coffer of frosted silver set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones and supported on four
feet of gilt bronze contained various necessaries for the toilette
two frosted Psyches decorated with diamond earrings some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian painted by Adrienne herself
consisting of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty
several consoles of oriental jasper supporting ewers and basins of
silver and of silver gilt richly chased and filled with scented waters
a voluptuously rich divan some seats and an illuminated gilt fable
completed the furniture of this chamber the atmosphere of which was
impregnated with the sweetest perfumes

Adrienne whom her attendants had just helped from the bath was seated
before her toilette her three women surrounding her By a caprice or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul filled as it
was with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things Adrienne had
wished the young women who served her to be very pretty and be dressed
with attention and with a charming originality We have already seen
Georgette a piquante blonde attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing ladys maid of Marivaux and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility

One of them named Florine a tall delicately slender and elegant
girl with the air and form of Diana Huntress was of a pale brown
complexion Her thick black hair was turned up behind where it was
fastened with a long golden pin Like the two other girls her arms were
uncovered to facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the
person of her charming mistress She wore a dress of that gay green so
familiar to the Venetian painters Her petticoat was very ample Her
slender waist curved in from under the plaits of a tucker of white
cambric plaited in five minute folds and fastened by five gold
buttons The third of Adriennes women had a face so fresh and
ingenuous a waist so delicate so pleasing and so finished that her
mistress had given her the name of Hebe Her dress of a delicate rose
color and Grecian cut displayed her charming neck and her beautiful
arms up to the very shoulders The physiognomy of these three young
women was laughter loving and happy On their features there was no
expression of that bitter sullenness willing and hated obedience or
offensive familiarity or base and degraded deference which are the
ordinary results of a state of servitude In the zealous eagerness of
the cares and attentions which they lavished upon Adrienne there seemed
to be at least as much of affection as of deference and respect They
appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from the services which they
rendered to their lovely mistress One would have thought that they
attached to the dressing and embellishment of her person all the merits
and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a work of art in the
accomplishing of which fruitful of delights they were stimulated by
the passions of love of pride and of joy

The sun beamed brightly upon the toiletcase placed in front of the
window Adrienne was seated on a chair its back elevated a little
more than usual She was enveloped in a long morninggown of blue silk
embroidered with a leaf of the same color which was fitted close to her
waist as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years by a girdle with floating tags Her neck delicately slender
and flexible as a birds was uncovered as were also her shoulders and
arms and all were of incomparable beauty Despite the vulgarity of
the comparison the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin of a texture so fresh and so firm
that some drops of water collected and still remaining about the
roots of her hair from the bath rolled in serpentine lines over her
shoulders like pearls or beads of crystal over white marble

And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation known but to
auburnheaded beauties was the deep purple of her humid lipsthe
roseate transparency of her small ears of her dilated nostrils and
her nails as bright and glossy as if they had been varnished In every
spot indeed where her pure arterial blood full of animation and
heat could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth Her eyes were very large and of a velvet softness Now
they glanced sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence
and wit and now they widened and extended themselves languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes of as
deep a black as her finelydrawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows for
by a delightful freak of nature she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair Her forehead small like those
of ancient Grecian statues formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval Her nose delicately curved was slightly aquiline the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them and her vermeil
mouth voluptuously sensual seemed to call for sweet kisses and the
gay smiles and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure It is
impossible to behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer more
noble or more elegant than hers thanks to the great distance which
separated the neck and the ear from their attachment to her outspread
and dimpled shoulders We have already said that Adrienne was
redhaired but it was the redness of many of the admirable portraits
of women by Titian and Leonardo da Vincithat is to say molten gold
presents not reflections more delightfully agreeable or more glittering
than the naturally undulating mass of her very long hair as soft and
fine as silk so long that when let loose it reached the floor in
it she could wholly envelop herself like another Venus arising from
the sea At the present moment Adriennes tresses were ravishing to
behold Georgette her arms bare stood behind her mistress and had
carefully collected into one of her small white hands those splendid
threads whose naturally ardent brightness was doubled in the sunshine
When the pretty ladysmaid pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of
the undulating and golden waves of that enormously magnificent skein of
silk one might have said that a thousand sparks of fire darted forth
and coruscated away from it in all directions The sunshine too
reflected not less golden and fiery rays from numerous clusters of
spiral ringlets which divided upon Adriennes forehead fell over her
cheeks and in their elastic flexibility caressed the risings of her
snowy bosom to whose charming undulations they adapted and applied
themselves Whilst Georgette standing combed the beautiful locks of
her mistress Hebe with one knee upon the floor and having upon
the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville busied herself in
fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin and crossed its
slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh color which
imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world Florine a little
farther back presented to her mistress in a jeweled box a perfumed
paste with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling hands
and outspread fingers which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities Let us not forget Frisky who couched in the lap of
her mistress opened her great eyes with all her might and seemed to
observe the different operations of Adriennes toilette with grave and
reflective attention A silver bell being sounded from without Florine
at a sign from her mistress went out and presently returned bearing
a letter upon a small silvergilt salve Adrienne while her women
continued fitting on her shoes dressing her hair and arranging her in
her habiliments took the letter which was written by the steward of
the estate of Cardoville and read aloud as follows

HONORED MADAME

Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity I venture to address you
with respectful confidence During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville your noble father I believe I may truly say
with probity and zeal The castle is now sold so that I and my wife in
our old age behold ourselves about to be dismissed and left destitute
of all resources which alas is very hard at our time of life

Poor creature said Adrienne interrupting herself in reading my
father certainly always prided himself upon their devotion to him and
their probity She continued

There does indeed remain to us a means of retaining our place
here but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness and be the
consequences to us what they may neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price

Good very good said Adrienne always the samedignity even in
povertyit is the sweet perfume of a flower not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow

In order to explain to you honored madame the unworthy task exacted
from us it is necessary to inform you in the first place that M
Rodin came here from Paris two days ago

Ah M Rodin said Mademoiselle de Cardoville interrupting herself
anew the secretary of Abbe dAigrigny I am not at all surprised at
him being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue But let us see

M Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold
and that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our
place if we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character
upon the new proprietress as her future confessor and if the better
to attain this end we would consent to calumniate another priest
a deserving and excellent man much loved and much respected in the
country Even that is not all I was required to write twice or thrice
a week to M Rodin and to relate to him everything that should occur in
the house I ought to acknowledge honored madame that these infamous
proposals were as much as possible disguised and dissimulated under
sufficiently specious pretexts but notwithstanding the aspect which
with more or less skill it was attempted to give to the affair it was
precisely and substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to
you

Corruption calumny and false and treacherous impeachment said
Adrienne with disgust I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black
venomous and vile reptiles of aspects most hideous indeed How much
more do I love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and
his wife Adrienne proceeded

Believe me we hesitated not an instant We quit Cardoville which
has been our home for the last twenty yearsbut we shall quit it like
honest people and with the consciousness of our integrity And now
honored madame if in the brilliant circle in which you moveyou
who are so benevolent and amiablecould find a place for us by your
recommendation then with endless gratitude to you we shall escape
from a position of most cruel embarrassment

Surely surely said Adrienne they shall not in vain appeal to me
To wrest excellent persons from the grip of M Rodin is not only a
duty but a pleasure for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous
enterprise and dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors Adrienne
again went on reading

After having thus spoken to you of ourselves honored madame permit
us to implore your protection for other unfortunates for it would be
wicked to think only of ones self Three days ago two shipwrecks took
place upon our ironbound coast A few passengers only were saved and
were conducted hither where I and my wife gave them all necessary
attentions All these passengers have departed for Paris except one
who still remains his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving
the house and indeed they will constrain him to remain for some days
to come He is a young East Indian prince of about twenty years of age
and he appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome which is
not a little to say though he has a tawny skin like the rest of his
countrymen as I understand

An Indian prince twenty years of age young amiable and handsome
exclaimed Adrienne gayly this is quite delightful and not at all
of an ordinary or vulgar nature Oh this Indian prince has already
awakened all my sympathies But what can I do with this Adonis from
the banks of the Ganges who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy
coast

Adriennes three women looked at her with much astonishment though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character

Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles
Florine the tall and beautiful pale brown girl also smiled like her
pretty companions but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress who though powerfully
interested by the situation of the Adonis from Ganges banks as she
had called him continued to read Duponts letter

One of the countrymen of the Indian prince who has also remained to
attend upon him has given me to understand that the youthful prince
has lost in the shipwreck all he possessed and knows not how to get to
Paris where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the
very greatest importance It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information no he appears to be too dignified and
proud to proclaim of his fate but his countryman more communicative
confidentially told me what I have stated adding that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities and that his
father who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom has been killed by
the English who have also dispossessed his son of his crown

This is very singular said Adrienne thoughtfully These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch and that
General Simon whom they have created a marshal had entered into his
service Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile she added
Gracious this affair will be quite odd and fantastical Such things
happen to nobody but me and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature But it seems to me that it is not I but Providence which in
truth sometimes shows itself very eccentric But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince

We trust honored madame that you will pardon our boldness but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish if while stating to you our
own griefs we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress In fine lady trust
to me I am old and I have had much experience of men and it was
only necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness
of countenance of this young Indian to enable me to judge that he is
worthy of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his
behalf It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money
for the purchase of some European clothing for he has lost all his
Indian vestments in the shipwreck

Good heavens European clothing exclaimed Adrienne gayly Poor
young prince Heaven preserve him from that and me also Chance has
sent hither from the heart of India a mortal so far favored as never
to have worn the abominable European costumethose hideous habits and
frightful hats which render the men so ridiculous so ugly that in
truth there is not a single good quality to be discovered in them nor
one spark of what can either captivate or attract There comes to me at
last a handsome young prince from the East where the men are clothed
in silk and cashmere Most assuredly Ill not miss this rare and
unique opportunity of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable
temptation No no not a European dress for me though poor Dupont
requests it But the namethe name of this dear prince Once more what
a singular event is this If it should turn out to be that cousin from
beyond the Ganges During my childhood I have heard so much in praise
of his royal father Oh I shall be quite ravished to give his son the
kind reception which he merits And then she read on

If besides this small sum honored madame you are so kind as to
give him and also his companion the means of reaching Paris you
will confer a very great service upon this poor young prince who is at
present so unfortunate

To conclude I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress in which case I beg that you will be
pleased to command me and you may rely upon my discretion If on the
contrary you wish to address it directly to himself his name is as it
has been written for me by his countrymen Prince Djalma son of Radja
sing King of Mundi

Djalma said Adrienne quickly and appearing to call up her
recollections Radjasing Yesthat is it These are the very names
that my father so often repeated while telling me that there was
nothing more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king our
relation by marriage and the son has not derogated it would seem from
that character Yes Djalma Radjasingonce more that is itsuch
names are not so common she added smiling that one should either
forget or confound them with others This Djalma is my cousin Brave
and goodyoung and charming above all he has never worn the
horrid European dress And destitute of every resource This is quite
ravishing It is too much happiness at once Quick quick let us
improvise a pretty fairy tale of which the handsome and beloved prince
shall be the hero The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has
wandered into our dismal climate but he will find here at least
something to remind him of his native region of sunshine and perfumes
Then addressing one of her women she said Georgette take paper and
write my child The young girl went to the gilt illuminated table
which contained materials for writing and having seated herself she
said to her mistress I await orders

Adrienne de Cardoville whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy proceeded to dictate the following letter
to a meritorious old painter who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing in which arts she excelled as indeed she did in
all others

MY DEAR TITIAN MY GOOD VERONESE MY WORTHY RAPHAEL

You can render me a very great serviceand you will do it I am
sure with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished

It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young manyes
sirfor a young manand according to what I imagine of him I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous or rather
from the Indian Bacchus yesthat will be more likely

It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety
and correctness magnificently rich and of the greatest elegance You
will choose the most beautiful stuffs possible and endeavor above all
things that they be or resemble tissues of Indian manufacture and
you will add to them for turbans and sashes six splendid long cashmere
shawls two of them white two red and two orange as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors

This done and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House which
you know so well The steward the excellent Dupont one of your old
friends will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince named
Djalma and you will tell that most potent grave and reverend signior
of another quarter of the globe that you have come on the part of an
unknown friend who taking upon himself the duty of a brother sends
him what is necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions
of Europe You will add that his friend expects him with so much
impatience that he conjures him to come to Paris immediately If he
objects that he is suffering you will tell him that my carriage is an
excellent bedcloset and you will cause the bedding etc which it
contains to be fitted up till he finds it quite commodious Remember
to make very humble excuses for the unknown friend not sending to the
prince either rich palanquins or even modestly a single elephant
for alas palanquins are only to be seen at the opera and there are
no elephants but those in the menageriethough this must make us seem
strangely barbarous in his eyes

As soon as you shall have decided on your departure perform the
journey as rapidly as possible and bring here into my house in the
Rue de Babylone what predestination that I should dwell in the street
of BABYLONa name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Orientalyou will bring hither I say this dear prince who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers diamonds and sun

Above all you will have the kindness my old and worthy friend not
to be at all astonished at this new freak and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures Seriously the choice which I have made of you
in this affairof you whom I esteem and most sincerely honoris
because it is sufficient to say to you that at the bottom of all this
there is something more than a seeming act of folly

In uttering these last words the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose But she quickly
resumed more gayly dictating to Georgette

Adieu my old friend I am something like that commander of ancient
days whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment
of battle yes for within an hour I shall give battle a pitched
battleto my dear pewdwelling aunt Fortunately audacity and courage
never failed me and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my
austere princess

A kiss and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife
If I speak of her here who is so justly respected you will please to
understand it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with for my sake a charming young princefor it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed

Once more adieu

Then addressing Georgette said she Have you done writing chit

Yes madame

Oh add this postscript

PSI send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses Spare
nothing You know I am quite a grand seigneur I must use this masculine
expression since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
tyrants as you are a term so significant as it is of noble
generosity

Now Georgette said Adrienne bring me an envelope and the letter
that I may sign it Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her signed the letter and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker which was expressed thus

Please pay M Norval on demand without grace the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account

 ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE

During all this scene while Georgette wrote Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistresss
toilette who had put off her morning gown and was now in full dress
in order to wait upon the princess her aunt From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adriennes
dictating to Georgette her letter to M Norval it might easily have
been seen that as was her habit indeed she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress

Now chit said Adrienne to Hebe send this letter immediately to M
Norval

The same silver bell was again rung from without Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressingroom to go and inquire what it was and also
to execute the order of her mistress as to the letter But Florine
precipitated herself so to speak before her and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment and said to Adrienne

Will it please my lady for me to send this letter I have occasion to
go to the mansion

Go Florine then said Adrienne seeing that you wish it Georgette
seal the letter

At the end of a second or two during which Georgette had sealed the
letter Hebe returned

Madame said she reentering the workingman who brought back
Frisky yesterday entreats you to admit him for an instant He is very
pale and he appears quite sad

Would that he may already have need of me I should be too happy said
Adrienne gayly Show the excellent young man into the little saloon
And Florine despatch this letter immediately

Florine went out Miss de Cardoville followed by Frisky entered the
little receptionroom where Agricola awaited her




CHAPTER XXXV THE INTERVIEW

When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity A robe of
deep blue perfectly fitted to her shape embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk according to the then fashion outlined
her nymphlike figure and her rounded bosom A French cambric collar
fastened by a large Scotch pebble set as a brooch served her for a
necklace Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses which reached nearly to her waist

Agricola in order to save explanations with his father and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M Hardy had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress he had put on a new
blouse though and the collar of his shirt of stout linen very white
fell over upon a black cravat negligently tied his gray trousers
allowed his well polished boots to be seen and he held between his
muscular hands a cap of fine woolen cloth quite new To sum up his
blue blouse embroidered with red showing off the nervous chest of the
young blacksmith and indicating his robust shoulders falling down
in graceful folds put not the least constraint upon his free and easy
gait and became him much better than either frockcoat or dresscoat
would have done While awaiting Miss de Cardoville Agricola
mechanically examined a magnificent silver vase admirably graven A
small tablet of the same metal fitted into a cavity of its antique
stand bore the wordsChased by JEAN MARIE working chaser 1831

Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon only
separated from another apartment by the doors that Agricola had not
perceived the young ladys entrance He started and turned quickly
round upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to himThat is a
beautiful vase is it not sir

Very beautiful madame answered Agricola greatly embarrassed

You may see from it that I like what is equitable added Miss de
Cardoville pointing with her finger to the little silver tabletan
artist puts his name upon his painting an author publishes his on the
titlepage of his book and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship

Oh madame so this name

Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece at the order
of a rich goldsmith When the latter sold me the vase he was amazed at
my eccentricity he would have almost said at my injustice when after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production
I ordered his name to be inscribed upon it instead of that of the
goldsmith which had already been affixed to the stand In the absence
of the rich profits let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill Is it
not just sir

It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously so that the blacksmith already beginning to feel a
little more at ease answered

Being a mechanic myself madame I cannot but be doubly affected by
such a proof of your sense of equity and justice

Since you are a mechanic sir resumed Adrienne I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer But please to be
seated

With a gesture full of affability she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold sitting down herself upon a teteatete of
the same materials

Seeing Agricolas hesitation who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment Adrienne to encourage him showed him Frisky and
said to him gayly This poor little animal to which I am very much
attached will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging
complaisance sir And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury
I know not what good presentiment whispers to me that perhaps I shall
have the pleasure of being useful to you in some affair

Madame said Agricola resolutely my name is Baudoin a blacksmith
in the employment of M Hardy at Pressy near the city Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it today I have come to request
of you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously
proposed I have said thus much all at once madame because it causes
me the greatest effort The words blistered my lips but now I shall be
more at ease

I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples sir said Adrienne but
if you knew me you would address me without fear How much do you
require

I do not know madame answered Agricola

I beg your pardon You dont know what sum

No madame and I come to you to request not only the sum necessary to
me but also information as to what that sum is

Let us see sir said Adrienne smiling explain this to me In spite
of my good will you feel that I cannot divine all at once what it is
that is required

Madame in two words I can state the truth I have a food old mother
who in her youth broke her health by excessive labor to enable her to
bring me up and not only me but a poor abandoned child whom she
had picked up It is my turn now to maintain her and that I have the
happiness of doing But in order to do so I have only my labor If I am
dragged from my employment my mother will be without support

Your mother cannot want for anything now sir since I interest myself
for her

You will interest yourself for her madame said Agricola

Certainly replied Adrienne

But you dont know her exclaimed the blacksmith

Now I do yes

Oh madame said Agricola with emotion after a moments silence
I understand you But indeed you have a noble heart Mother Bunch was
right

Mother Bunch said Adrienne looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air for what he said to her was an enigma

The blacksmith who blushed not for his friends replied frankly

Madame permit me to explain to you Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman with whom I have been brought up She
is deformed which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch But
though on the one hand she is sunk as low as you are highly elevated
on the other yet as regards the heartas to delicacyoh lady I am
certain that your heart is of equal worth with hers That was at once
her own thought after I had related to her in what manner yesterday
you had presented me with that beautiful flower

I can assure you sir said Adrienne sincerely touched that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to mea heart that remains good and delicate in spite of cruel
misfortunes is so rare a treasure while it is very easy to be good
when we have youth and beauty and to be delicate and generous when
we are rich I accept then your comparison but on condition that
you will quickly put me in a situation to deserve it Pray go on
therefore

In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly though profound respect which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment

If my mother alone madame were exposed to the rigor which I dread
I should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment Among poor people the poor help one
another and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house
our excellent neighbors who would willingly succor her But they
themselves are far from being well off and as they would incur
privations by assisting her their little benefit would still be more
painful to my mother than the endurance even of misery by herself And
besides it is not only for my mother that my exertions are required
but for my father whom we have not seen for eighteen years and who has
just arrived from Siberia where he remained during all that time from
zealous devotion to his former general now Marshal Simon

Marshal Simon said Adrienne quickly with an expression of much
surprise

Do you know the marshal madame

I do not personally know him but he married a lady of our family

What joy exclaimed the blacksmith then the two young ladies his
daughters whom my father has brought from Russia are your relations

Has Marshal Simon two daughters asked Adrienne more and more
astonished and interested

Yes madame two little angels of fifteen or sixteen and so pretty
so sweet they are twins so very much alike as to be mistaken for one
another Their mother died in exile and the little she possessed having
been confiscated they have come hither with my father from the depths
of Siberia travelling very wretchedly but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness
My excellent father you will not believe madame that with the
courage of a lion he has all the love and tenderness of a mother

And where are the dear children sir asked Adrienne

At our home madame It is that which renders my position so very hard
that which has given me courage to come to you it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household even thus augmented
but that I am about to be arrested

About to be arrested For what

Pray madame have the goodness to read this letter which has been
sent by some one to Mother Bunch

Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman

After having read the letter Adrienne said to the blacksmith with
surprise It appears sir you are a poet

I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one madame Only
when I return to my mother after a days toil and often even while
forging my iron in order to divert and relax my attention I amuse
myself with rhymes sometimes composing an ode sometimes a song

And your song of the Freed Workman which is mentioned in this letter
is therefore very disaffectedvery dangerous

Oh no madame quite the contrary For myself I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M Hardy who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse and I had limited myself to attempt in favor of the great
mass of the working classes an equitable sincere warm and earnest
claimnothing more But you are aware perhaps Madame that in
times of conspiracy and commotion people are often incriminated and
imprisoned on very slight grounds Should such a misfortune befall me
what will become of my mother my father and the two orphans whom we
are bound to regard as part of our family until the return of their
father Marshal Simon It is on this account madame that if I remain
I run the risk of being arrested I have come to you to request you to
provide surety for me so that I should not be compelled to exchange
the workshop for the prison in which case I can answer for it that the
fruits of my labor will suffice for all

Thank the stars said Adrienne gayly this affair will arrange
itself quite easily Henceforth Mr Poet you shall draw your
inspirations in the midst of good fortune instead of adversity Sad
muse But first of all bonds shall be given for you

Oh madame you have saved us

To continue said Adrienne the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister understand that as you like
said she smiling you will not deceive yourself much The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him on account of his
health the sweets and repose of private life to the very eve of the
day on which his portfolio was taken from him Keep yourself then
perfectly at ease If the surety be insufficient we shall be able to
devise some other means

Madame said Agricola with great emotion I am indebted to you for
the repose perhaps for the life of my mother Believe that I shall ever
be grateful

That is all quite simple Now for another thing It is proper that
those who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of
those who have too little Marshal Simons daughters are members of my
family and they will reside here with me which will be more suitable
You will apprise your worthy mother of this and in the evening besides
going to thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young
relations I shall fetch them home

At this moment Georgette throwing open the door which separated the
room from an adjacent apartment hurriedly entered with an affrighted
look exclaiming

Oh madame something extraordinary is going on in the street

How so Explain yourself said Adrienne

I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little gardengate said
Georgette where I saw some illlooking men attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little outbuilding belonging to the pavilion
as if they wished to spy out some one

Madame said Agricola with chagrin I have not been deceived They
are after me

What say you

I thought I was followed from the moment when I left the Rue St
Merry and now it is beyond doubt They must have seen me enter your
house and are on the watch to arrest me Well now that your interest
has been acquired for my mothernow that I have no farther uneasiness
for Marshal Simons daughtersrather than hazard your exposure to
anything the least unpleasant I run to deliver myself up

Beware of that sir said Adrienne quickly Liberty is too precious
to be voluntarily sacrificed Besides Georgette may have been mistaken
But in any case I entreat you not to surrender yourself Take
my advice and escape being arrested That I think will greatly
facilitate my measures for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great
desire to keep possession of those upon whom she has once pounced

Madame said Hebe now also entering with a terrified look a man
knocked at the little door and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here He added that the person whom he seeks is
named Agricola Baudoin and that he has something to tell him of great
importance

Thats my name said Agricola but the important information is a
trick to draw me out

Evidently said Adrienne and therefore we must play off trick for
trick What did you answer child added she addressing herself to
Hebe

I answered that I didnt know what he was talking about

Quite right said Adrienne and the man who put the question

He went away madame

Without doubt to come back again soon said Agricola

That is very probable said Adrienne and therefore sir it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess SaintDizier my
aunt for an important interview which can no longer be delayed and
is rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon Remain here then sir since if you go out
you will certainly be arrested

Madame pardon my refusal but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer

Why

They have tried to draw me out in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out they will come
in and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother what signifies prison

And the grief that your mother will feel her uneasiness and her
fearsnothing Think of your father and that poor workwoman who
loves you as a brother and whom I value as a sistersay sir do you
forget them also Believe me it is better to spare those torments to
your family Remain here and before the evening I am certain either
by giving surety or some other means of delivering you from these
annoyances

But madame supposing that I do accept your generous offer they will
come and find me here

Not at all There is in this pavilion which was formerly the abode of
a noblemans lefthanded wifeyou see sir said Adrienne smiling
that live in a very profane placethere is here a secret place
of concealment so wonderfully wellcontrived that it can defy all
searches Georgette will conduct you to it You will be very well
accommodated You will even be able to write some verses for me if the
place inspire you

Oh madame how great is your goodness how have I merited it

Oh sir I will tell you Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interestadmitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon my relationsdo you
forget Frisky sir asked Adrienne laughingFrisky there whom
you have restored to my fondles Seriously if I laugh continued this
singular and extravagant creature it is because I know that you
are entirely out of danger and that I feel an increase of happiness
Therefore sir write for me quickly your address and your mothers in
this pocketbook follow Georgette and spin me some pretty verses if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly

While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hidingplace Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather
for Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess SaintDizier

A quarter of an hour after this scene Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs Grivois the first woman of the princess

Well demanded Mrs Grivois of the young woman

Here are the notes which I have taken this morning said Florine
putting a paper into the duennas hand Happily I have a good memory

At what time exactly did she return home this morning asked the
duenna quickly

Who madame

Miss Adrienne

She did not go out madame We put her in the bath at nine oclock

But before nine oclock she came home after having passed the night
out of her house Eight oclock was the time at which she returned
however

Florine looked at Mrs Grivois with profound astonishment and saidI
do not understand you madame

Whats that Madame did not come home this morning at eight oclock
Dare you lie

I was ill yesterday and did not come down till nine this morning in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath I
know nothing of what passed previously I swear to you madame

That alters the case You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions They dont distrust you and will tell you all

Yes madame

What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her

Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M Norval I requested
permission to send it off as a pretext for going out and for writing
down all I recollected

Very well And this letter

Jerome had to go out and I gave it him to put in the postoffice

Idiot exclaimed Mrs Grivois couldnt you bring it to me

But as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette as is her custom I knew
the contents of the letter and I have written it in my notes

Thats not the same thing It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter the princess will be very much displeased

I thought I did right madame

I know that it is not good will that fails you For these six months
I have been satisfied with you But this time you have committed a very
great mistake

Be indulgent madame what I do is sufficiently painful The girl
stifled a sigh

Mrs Grivois looked fixedly at her and said in a sardonic tone

Very well my dear do not continue it If you have scruples you are
free Go your way

You well know that I am not free madame said Florine reddening
and with tears in her eyes she added I am dependent upon M Rodin who
placed me here

Wherefore these regrets then

In spite of ones self one feels remorse Madame is so good and so
confiding

She is all perfection certainly But you are not here to sing her
praises What occurred afterwards

The workingman who yesterday found and brought back Frisky came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady

And is this workingman still in her house

I dont know He came in when I was going out with the letter

You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about

Yes madame

Has your mistress seemed preoccupied uneasy or afraid of the
interview which she is to have today with the princess She conceals so
little of what she thinks that you ought to know

She has been as gay as usual She has even jested about the interview

Oh jested has she said the tirewoman muttering between her teeth
without Florine being able to hear her They laugh most who laugh
last In spite of her audacious and diabolical character she would
tremble and would pray for mercy if she knew what awaits her this
day Then addressing Florine she continuedReturn and keep yourself
I advise you from those fine scruples which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn Do not forget

I cannot forget that I belong not to myself madame

Anyway let it be so Farewell

Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess SaintDizier

CHAPTER XXXVI A FEMALE JESUIT

During the preceding scenes which occurred in the Pompadour rotunda
occupied by Miss de Cardoville other events took place in the residence
of the Princess SaintDizier The elegance and sumptuousness of the
former dwelling presented a strong contrast to the gloomy interior of
the latter the first floor of which was inhabited by the princess for
the plan of the ground floor rendered it only fit for giving parties
and for a long time past Madame de SaintDizier had renounced all
worldly splendors The gravity of her domestics all aged and dressed in
black the profound silence which reigned in her abode where everything
was spoken if it could be called speaking in an undertone and
the almost monastic regularity and order of this immense mansion
communicated to everything around the princess a sad and chilling
character A man of the world who joined great courage to rare
independence of spirit speaking of the princess to whom Adrienne
de Cardoville went according to her expression to fight a pitched
battle said of her as follows In order to avoid having Madame de
SaintDizier for an enemy I who am neither bashful nor cowardly have
for the first time in my life been both a noodle and a coward This
man spoke sincerely But Madame de SaintDizier had not all at once
arrived at this high degree of importance

Some words are necessary for the purpose of exhibiting distinctly some
phases in the life of this dangerous and implacable woman who by
her affiliation with the Order of Jesuits had acquired an occult and
formidable power For there is something even more menacing than a
Jesuit it is a Jesuits and when one has seen certain circles it
becomes evident that there exist unhappily many of those affiliated
who more or less uniformly dress for the lay members of the Order
call themselves Jesuits of the short robe

Madame de SaintDizier once very beautiful had been during the last
years of the Empire and the early years of the Restoration one of the
most fashionable women of Paris of a stirring active adventurous
and commanding spirit of cold heart but lively imagination She was
greatly given to amorous adventures not from tenderness of heart but
from a passion for intrigue which she loved as men love playfor the
sake of the emotions it excites Unhappily such had always been the
blindness or the carelessness of her husband the Prince of SaintDizier
eldest brother of the Count of Rennepont and Duke of Cardoville father
of Adrienne that during his life he had never said one word that could
make it be thought that he suspected the actions of his wife Attaching
herself to Napoleon to dig a mine under the feet of the Colossus that
design at least afforded emotions sufficient to gratify the humor of
the most insatiable During some time all went well The princess was
beautiful and spirited dexterous and false perfidious and seductive
She was surrounded by fanatical adorers upon whom she played off a
kind of ferocious coquetry to induce them to run their heads into grave
conspiracies They hoped to resuscitate the Fonder party and carried
on a very active secret correspondence with some influential personages
abroad well known for their hatred against the emperor and France
Hence arose her first epistolary relations with the Marquis dAigrigny
then colonel in the Russian service and aidedecamp to General Moreau
But one day all these petty intrigues were discovered Many knights
of Madame de SaintDizier were sent to Vincennes but the emperor who
might have punished her terribly contented himself with exiling the
princess to one of her estates near Dunkirk

Upon the Restoration the persecutions which Madame de SaintDizier had
suffered for the Good Cause were entered to her credit and she acquired
even then very considerable influence in spite of the lightness of her
behavior The Marquis dAigrigny having entered the military service of
France remained there He was handsome and of fashionable manners and
address He had corresponded and conspired with the princess without
knowing her and these circumstances necessarily led to a close
connection between them

Excessive selflove a taste for exciting pleasures aspirations
of hatred pride and lordliness a species of evil sympathy the
perfidious attraction of which brings together perverse natures without
mingling them had made of the princess and the Marquis accomplices
rather than lovers This connection based upon selfish and bitter
feelings and upon the support which two characters of this dangerous
temper could lend to each other against a world in which their spirit of
intrigue of gallantry and of contempt had made them many enemies this
connection endured till the moment when after his duel with General
Simon the Marquis entered a religious house without any one
understanding the cause of his unexpected and sudden resolution

The princess having not yet heard the hour of her conversion strike
continued to whirl round the vortex of the world with a greedy jealous
and hateful ardor for she saw that the last years of her beauty were
dying out

An estimate of the character of this woman may be formed from the
following fact

Still very agreeable she wished to close her worldly and volatile
career with some brilliant and final triumph as a great actress knows
the proper time to withdraw from the stage so as to leave regrets
behind Desirous of offering up this final incense to her own vanity
the princess skillfully selected her victims She spied out in the world
a young couple who idolized each other and by dint of cunning and
address she succeeded in taking away the lover from his mistress a
charming woman of eighteen by whom he was adored This triumph being
achieved Madame SaintDizier retired from the fashionable world in the
full blaze of her exploit After many long conversations with the Abbe
Marquis dAigrigny who had become a renowned preacher she departed
suddenly from Paris and spent two years upon her estate near Dunkirk
to which she took only one of her female attendants viz Mrs Grivois

When the princess afterwards returned to Paris it was impossible
to recognize the frivolous intriguing and dissipated woman she had
formerly been The metamorphosis was as complete as it was extraordinary
and even startling SaintDizier House heretofore open to the banquets
and festivals of every kind of pleasure became gloomily silent and
austere Instead of the world of elegance and fashion the princess now
received in her mansion only women of ostentatious piety and men of
consequence who were remarkably exemplary by the extravagant rigor of
their religious and monarchial principles Above all she drew around
her several noted members of the higher orders of the clergy She was
appointed patroness of a body of religious females She had her own
confessor chaplin almoner and even spiritual director but this
last performed his functions in partibus The MarquisAbbe dAigrigny
continued in reality to be her spiritual guide and it is almost
unnecessary to say that for a long time past their mutual relations as
to flirting had entirely ceased

This sudden and complete conversion of a gay and distinguished woman
especially as it was loudly trumpeted forth struck the greater number
of persons with wonder and respect Others more discerning only
smiled

A single anecdote from amongst a thousand will suffice to show the
alarming influence and power which the princess had acquired since her
affiliation with the Jesuits This anecdote will also exhibit the deep
vindictive and pitiless character of this woman whom Adrienne de
Cardoville had so imprudently made herself ready to brave

Amongst the persons who smiled more or less at the conversion of Madame
de SaintDizier were the young and charming couple whom she had so
cruelly disunited before she quitted forever the scenes of revelry
in which she had lived The young couple became more impassioned and
devoted to each other than ever they were reconciled and married after
the passing storm which had hurled them asunder and they indulged in
no other vengeance against the author of their temporary infelicity than
that of mildly jesting at the pious conversion of the woman who had done
them so much injury

Some time after a terrible fatality overtook the loving pair The
husband until then blindly unsuspicious was suddenly inflamed by
anonymous communications A dreadful rupture ensued and the young wife
perished

As for the husband certain vague rumors far from distinct yet
pregnant with secret meanings perfidiously contrived and a thousand
times more detestable than formal accusations which can at least be
met and destroyed were strewn about him with so much perseverance with
a skill so diabolical and by means and ways so very various that his
best friends by little and little withdrew themselves from him
thus yielding to the slow irresistible influence of that incessant
whispering and buzzing confused as indistinct amounting to some such
results as thisWell you know says one

No replies another

People say very vile things about him

Do they really What then

I dont know Bad reports Rumors grievously affecting his honor

The deuce Thats very serious It accounts for the coldness with which
he is now everywhere received

I shall avoid him in future

So will I etc

Such is the world that very often nothing more than groundless surmises
are necessary to brand a man whose very happiness may have incurred
envy So it was with the gentleman of whom we speak The unfortunate
man seeing the void around him extending itselffeeling so to speak
the earth crumbling from beneath his feet knew not where to find or
grasp the impalpable enemy whose blows he felt for not once had the
idea occurred to him of suspecting the princess whom he had not seen
since his adventure with her Anxiously desiring to learn why he was so
much shunned and despised he at length sought an explanation from
an old friend but he received only a disdainfully evasive answer
at which being exasperated he demanded satisfaction His adversary
repliedIf you can find two persons of our acquaintance I will fight
you The unhappy man could not find one

Finally forsaken by all without having ever obtained an explanation of
the reason for forsaking himsuffering keenly for the fate of the
wife whom he had lost he became mad with grief rage and despair and
killed himself

On the day of his death Madame de SaintDizier remarked that it was
fit and necessary that one who had lived so shamefully should come to
an equally shameful end and that he who had so long jested at all laws
human and divine could not seemly otherwise terminate his wretched life
than by perpetrating a last crimesuicide And the friends of Madame de
SaintDizier hawked about and everywhere repeated these terrible words
with a contrite air as if beatified and convinced But this was not
all Along with chastisements there were rewards

Observant people remarked that the favorites of the religious clan of
Madame de SaintDizier rose to high distinction with singular rapidity
The virtuous young men such as were religiously attentive to tiresome
sermons were married to rich orphans of the Sacred Heart Convents who
were held in reserve for the purpose poor young girls who learning
too late what it is to have a pious husband selected and imposed upon
them by a set of devotees often expiated by very bitter tears the
deceitful favor of thus being admitted into a world of hypocrisy and
falsehood in which they found themselves strangers without support
crushed by it if they dared to complain of the marriages to which they
had been condemned

In the parlor of Madame de SaintDizier were appointed prefects
colonels treasurers deputies academicians bishops and peers of
the realm from whom nothing more was required in return for the
allpowerful support bestowed upon them but to wear a pious gloss
sometimes publicly take the communion swear furious war against
everything impious or revolutionaryand above all correspond
confidentially upon different subjects of his choosing with the Abbe
dAigrignyan amusement moreover which was very agreeable for the
abbe was the most amiable man in the world the most witty and above
all the most obliging The following is an historical fact which
requires the bitter and vengeful irony of Moliere or Pascal to do it
justice

During the last year of the Restoration there was one of the mighty
dignitaries of the court a firm and independent man who did not
make profession as the holy fathers call it that is who did
not communicate at the altar The splendor amid which he moved was
calculated to give the weight of a very injurious example to his
indifference The AbbeMarquis dAigrigny was therefore despatched to
him and he knowing the honorable and elevated character of the non
communicant thought that if he could only bring him to profess by
any means whatever the means might be the effect would be what was
desired Like a man of intellect the abbe prized the dogma but cheaply
himself He only spoke of the suitableness of the step and of the
highly salutary example which the resolution to adopt it would afford to
the public

M Abbe replied the person sought to be influenced I have a greater
respect for religion than you have I should consider it an infamous
mockery to go to the communion table without feeling the proper
conviction

Nonsense you inflexible man you frowning Alcestes said the Marquis
Abbe smiling slyly Your profits and your scruples will go together
believe me by listening to me In short we shall manage to make it a
BLANK COMMUNION for you for after all what is it that we askonly
the APPEARANCE

Now a BLANK COMMUNION means breaking an unconsecrated wafer

The AbbeMarquis retired with his offers which were rejected with
indignationbut then the refractory man was dismissed from his place
at court This was but a single isolated fact Woe to all who found
themselves opposed to the interest and principles of Madame de Saint
Dizier or her friends Sooner or later directly or indirectly they
felt themselves cruelly stabbed generally immediatelysome in their
dearest connections others in their credit some in their honor
others in their official functions and all by secret action noiseless
continuous and latent in time becoming a terrible and mysterious
dissolvent which invisibly undermined reputations fortunes positions
the most solidly established until the moment when all sunk forever
into the abyss amid the surprise and terror of the beholders

It will now be conceived how under the Restoration the Princess de Saint
Dizier had become singularly influential and formidable At the time of
the Revolution of July 1830 she had rallied and strangely enough
by preserving some relation of family and of society with persons
faithful to the worship of decayed monarchy people still attributed to
the princess much influence and power Let us mention at last that
the Prince of SaintDizier having died many years since his very large
personal fortune had descended to his younger brother the father of
Adrienne de Cardoville and he having died eighteen months ago that
young lady found herself to be the last and only representative of that
branch of the family of the Renneponts

The Princess of SaintDizier awaited her niece in a very large room
rendered dismal by its gloomy green damask The chairs etc covered
with similar stuff were of carved ebony Paintings of scriptural
and other religious subjects and an ivory crucifix thrown up from
a background of black velvet contributed to give the apartment a
lugubrious and austere aspect

Madame de SaintDizier seated before a large desk has just finished
putting the seals on numerous letters for she had a very extensive and
very diversified correspondence Though then aged about fortyfive she
was still fair Advancing years had somewhat thickened her shape which
formerly of distinguished elegance was still sufficiently handsome to
be seen to advantage under the straight folds of her black dress Her
headdress very simple decorated with gray ribbons allowed her fair
sleek hair to be seen arranged in broad bands At first look people
were struck with her dignified though unassuming appearance and would
have vainly tried to discover in her physiognomy now marked with
repentant calmness any trace of the agitations of her past life So
naturally grave and reserved was she that people could not believe her
the heroine of so many intrigues and adventures and gallantry
Moreover if by chance she ever heard any lightness of conversation her
countenance since she had come to believe herself a kind of mother
in the Church immediately expressed candid but grieved astonishment
which soon changed into an air of offended chastity and disdainful pity

For the rest her smile when requisite was still full of grace and
even of the seducing and resistless sweetness of seeming goodnature
Her large blue eyes on fit occasions became affectionate and
caressing But if any one dared to wound or ruffle her pride gainsay
her orders or harm her interests her countenance usually placid and
serene betrayed a cold but implacable malignity Mrs Grivois entered
the cabinet holding in her hand Florines report of the manner in which
Adrienne de Cardoville had spent the morning

Mrs Grivois had been about twenty years in the service of Madame de
SaintDizier She knew everything that a ladysmaid could or ought to
have known of her mistress in the days of her sowing of wild being a
lady flowers Was it from choice that the princess had still retained
about her person this sowellinformed witness of the numerous follies
of her youth The world was kept in ignorance of the motive but one
thing was evident viz that Mrs Grivois enjoyed great privileges
under the princess and was treated by her rather as a companion than as
a tiring woman

Here are Florines notes madame said Mrs Grivois giving the paper
to the princess

I will examine them presently said the princess but tell me is my
niece coming Pending the conference at which she is to be present you
will conduct into her house a person who will soon be here to inquire
for you by my desire

Well madame

This man will make an exact inventory of everything contained in
Adriennes residence You will take care that nothing is omitted for
that is of very great importance

Yes madame But should Georgette or Hebe make any opposition

There is no fear the man charged with taking the inventory is of such
a stamp that when they know him they will not dare to oppose either
his making the inventory or his other steps It will be necessary
not to fail as you go along with him to be careful to obtain certain
peculiarities destined to confirm the reports which you have spread for
some time past

Do not have the slightest doubt madame The reports have all the
consistency of truth

Very soon then this Adrienne so insolent and so haughty will be
crushed and compelled to pray for pardon and from me

An old footman opened both of the folding doors and announced the
MarquisAbbe dAigrigny

If Miss de Cardoville present herself said the princess to Mrs
Grivois you will request her to wait an instant

Yes madame said the duenna going out with the servant

Madame de SaintDizier and DAigrigny remained alone




CHAPTER XXXVII THE PLOT

The AbbeMarquis dAigrigny as the reader has easily divined was
the person already seen in the Rue du MilieudesUrsins whence he had
departed from Rome in which city he had remained about three months
The marquis was dressed in deep mourning but with his usual elegance
His was not a priestly robe his black coat and his waistcoat tightly
gathered in at the waist set off to great advantage the elegance of
his figure his black cassimere pantaloons disguised his feet exactly
fitted with lace boots brilliantly polished And all traces of his
tonsure disappeared in the midst of the slight baldness which whitened
slightly the back part of his head There was nothing in his entire
costume or aspect that revealed the priest except perhaps
the entire absence of beard the more remarkable upon so manly a
countenance His chin newly shaved rested on a large and elevated
black cravat tied with a military ostentation which reminded the
beholder that this abbemarquis this celebrated preachernow one of
the most active and influential chiefs of his order had commanded a
regiment of hussars upon the Restoration and had fought in aid of the
Russians against France

Returned to Paris only this morning the marquis had not seen the
princess since his mother the Dowager Marchioness dAigrigny had died
near Dunkirk upon an estate belonging to Madame de SaintDizier while
vainly calling for her son to alleviate her last moments but the order
to which M dAigrigny had thought fit to sacrifice the most sacred
feeling and duties of nature having been suddenly transmitted to him
from Rome he had immediately set out for that city though not without
hesitation which was remarked and denounced by Rodin for the love of
M dAigrigny for his mother had been the only pure feeling that had
invariably distinguished his life

When the servant had discreetly withdrawn with Mrs Grivois the marquis
quickly approached the princess held out his hand to her and said with
a voice of emotion

Herminia have you not concealed something in your letters In her last
moments did not my mother curse me

No no Frederick compose yourself She had anxiously desired your
presence Her ideas soon became confused But in her delirium it was
still for you that she called

Yes said the marquis bitterly her maternal instinct doubtless
assured her that my presence could have saved her life

I entreat you to banish these sad recollections said the princess
this misfortune is irreparable

Tell me for the last time truly did not my absence cruelly affect
my mother Had she no suspicion that a more imperious duty called me
elsewhere

No no I assure you Even when her reason was shaken she believed
that you had not yet had time to come to her All the sad details which
I wrote to you upon this painful subject are strictly true Again I beg
of you to compose yourself

Yes my conscience ought to be easy for I have fulfilled my duty in
sacrificing my mother Yet I have never been able to arrive at that
complete detachment from natural affection which is commanded to us
by those awful words He who hates not his father and his mother even
with the soul cannot be my disciple9

Doubtless Frederick said the princess these renunciations are
painful But in return what influence what power

It is true said the marquis after a moments silence What ought
not to be sacrificed in order to reign in secret over the allpowerful
of the earth who lord it in full day This journey to Rome from which
I have just returned has given me a new idea of our formidable power
For Herminia it is Rome which is the culminating point overlooking
the fairest and broadest quarters of the globe made so by custom by
tradition or by faith Thence can our workings be embraced in their
full extent It is an uncommon view to see from its height the myriad
tools whose personality is continually absorbed into the immovable
personality of our Order What a might we possess Verily I am always
swayed with admiration aye almost frightened that man once thinks
wishes believes and acts as he alone lists until soon ours he
becomes but a human shell its kernel of intelligence mind reason
conscience and free will shrivelled within him dry and withered by
the habit of mutely fearingly bowing under mysterious tasks which
shatter and slay everything spontaneous in the human soul Then do we
infuse in such spiritless clay speechless cold and motionless as
corpses the breath of our Order and lo the dry bones stand up and
walk acting and executing though only within the limits which are
circled round them evermore Thus do they become mere limbs of the
gigantic trunk whose impulses they mechanically carry out while
ignorant of the design like the stonecutter who shapes out a stone
unaware if it be for cathedral or bagnio

In so speaking the marquiss features wore an incredible air of proud
and domineering haughtiness

Oh yes this power is great most great observed the princess and
the more formidable because it moves in a mysterious way over minds and
consciences

Aye Herminia said the marquis I have had under my command a
magnificent regiment Very often have I experienced the energetic and
exquisite enjoyment of command At my word my squadrons put themselves
in action bugles blared my officers glittering in golden embroidery
galloped everywhere to repeat my orders all my brave soldiers burning
with courage and cicatrized by battles obeyed my signal and I felt
proud and strong holding as I did so to speak in my hands the force
and valor of each and all combined into one being of resistless strength
and invincible intrepidityof all of which I was as much the
master as I mastered the rage and fire of my warhorse Aye that was
greatness But now in spite of the misfortunes which have befallen
our Order I feel myself a thousand times more ready for action more
authoritative more strong and more daring at the head of our mute
and blackrobed militia who only think and wish or move and obey
mechanically according to my will On a sign they scatter over the
surface of the globe gliding stealthily into households under the guise
of confessing the wife or teaching the children into family affairs
by hearing the dying avowalsup to the throne through the quaking
conscience of a credulous crowned cowardaye even to the chair of
the Pope himself living manifesto of the Godhead though he is by the
services rendered him or imposed by him Is not this secret rule made
to kindle or glut the wildest ambition as it reaches from the cradle to
the grave from the laborers hovel to the royal palace from palace
to the papal chair What career in all the world presents such splendid
openings what unutterable scorn ought I not feel for the bright
butterfly life of early days when we made so many envy us Dont you
remember Herminia he added with a bitter smile

You are right perfectly right Frederick replied the princess
quickly How little soever we may reflect with what contempt do we not
think upon the past I like you often compare it with the present
and then what satisfaction I feel at having followed your counsels For
indeed without you I should have played the miserable and ridiculous
part which a woman always plays in her decline from having been
beautiful and surrounded by admirers What could I have done at this
hour I should have vainly striven to retain around me a selfish and
ungrateful world of gross and shameful men who court women only
that they may turn them to the service of their passions or to the
gratification of their vanity It is true that there would have remained
to me the resource of what is called keeping an agreeable house for all
othersyes in order to entertain them be visited by a crowd of
the indifferent to afford opportunities of meeting to amorous young
couples who following each other from parlor to parlor come not
to your house but for the purpose of being together a very pretty
pleasure truly that of harboring those blooming laughing amorous
youths who look upon the luxury and brilliancy with which one surrounds
them as if they were their due upon bonds to minister to their
pleasure and to their impudent amours

Her words were so stinging and such hateful envy sat upon her face
that she betrayed the intense bitterness of her regrets in spite of
herself

NO no thanks to you Frederick she continued After a last and
brilliant triumph I broke forever with the world which would soon have
abandoned me though I was so long its idol and its queen And I have
only changed my queendom Instead of the dissipated men whom I ruled
with a frivolity superior to their own I now find myself surrounded by
men of high consideration of redoubtable character and allpowerful
many of whom have governed the state to them I have devoted myself as
they have devoted themselves to me It is now only that I really enjoy
that happiness of which I ever dreamt I have taken an active part and
have exercised a powerful influence over the greatest interests of the
world I have been initiated into the most important secrets I have
been able to strike surely whosoever scoffed at or hated me and I
have been able to elevate beyond their hopes those who have served or
respected and obeyed me

There are some madmen and some so blind that they imagine that we
are struck down because we ourselves have had to struggle against some
misfortunes said M dAigrigny disdainfully as if we were not
above all others securely founded organized for every struggle and
drew not from our very struggles a new and more vigorous activity
Doubtless the times are bad But they will become better and as you
know it is nearly certain that in a few days the 13th of February we
shall have at our disposal a means of action sufficiently powerful for
re establishing our influence which has been temporarily shaken

Yes doubtless this affair of the medals is most important said the
princess

I should not have made so much haste to return hither resumed the
abbe were it not to act in what will be perhaps for us a very great
event

But you are aware of the fatality which has once again overthrown
projects the most laboriously conceived and matured

Yes immediately on arriving I saw Rodin

And he told you

The inconceivable arrival of the Indian and of General Simons
daughters at Cardoville Castle after a double shipwreck which threw
them upon the coast of Picardy though it was deemed certain that the
young girls were at Leipsic and the Indian in Java Precautions were
so well taken indeed added the marquis in vexation that one would
think an invisible power protects this family

Happily Rodin is a man of resources and activity resumed the
princess He came here last night and we had a long conversation

And the result of your consultation is excellent added the marquis
the old soldier is to be kept out of the way for two days and his
wifes confessor has been posted the rest will proceed of itself To
morrow the girls need no longer be feared and the Indian remains at
Cardoville wounded dangerously We have plenty of time for action

But that is not all continued the princess there are still without
reckoning my niece two persons who for our interests ought not to be
found in Paris on the 13th of February

Yes M Hardy but his most dear and intimate friend has betrayed him
for by means of that friend we have drawn M Hardy into the South
whence it is impossible for him to return before a month As for that
miserable vagabond workman surnamed Sleepinbuff

Fie exclaimed the princess with an expression of outraged modesty

That man resumed the marquis is no longer an object of inquietude
Lastly Gabriel upon whom our vast and certain hope reposes will not
be left by himself for a single minute until the great day Everything
seems you see to promise success indeed more so than ever and it is
necessary to obtain this success at any price It is for us a question
of life or death for in returning I stopped at Forli and there
saw the Duke dOrbano His influence over the mind of the king is all
powerfulindeed absolute and he has completely prepossessed the royal
mind It is with the duke alone then that it is possible to treat

Well

DOrbano has gained strength and he can I know it assure to us a
legal existence highly protected in the dominions of his master with
full charge of popular education Thanks to such advantages after two
or three years in that country we shall become so deeply rooted that
this very Duke dOrbano in his turn will have to solicit support and
protection from us But at present he has everything in his power and
he puts an absolute condition upon his services

What is the condition

Five millions down and an annual pension of a hundred thousand
francs

It is very much

Nay but little if it be considered that our foot once planted in that
country we shall promptly repossess ourselves of that sum which after
all is scarcely an eighth part of what the affair of the medals if
happily brought to an issue ought to assure to the Order

Yes nearly forty millions said the princess thoughtfully

And again these five millions that Orbano demands will be but an
advance They will be returned to us in voluntary gifts by reason even
of the increase of influence that we shall acquire from the education
of children through whom we have their families And yet the fools
hesitate those who govern see not that in doing our own business we
do theirs alsothat in abandoning education to us which is what we
wish for above all things we mold the people into that mute and quiet
obedience that servile and brutal submission which assures the repose
of states by the immobility of the mind They dont reflect that most
of the upper and middle classes fear and hate us dont understand that
when we have persuaded the mass that their wretchedness is an eternal
law that sufferers must give up hope of relief that it is a crime to
sigh for welfare in this world since the crown of glory on high is the
only reward for misery here then the stupefied people will resignedly
wallow in the mire all their impatient aspirations for better days
smothered and the volcanoblasts blown aside which made the future of
rulers so horrid and so dark They see not in truth that this blind
and passive faith which we demand from the mass furnishes their rulers
with a bridle with which both to conduct and curb them whilst we ask
from the happy of the world only some appearances which ought if they
had only the knowledge of their own corruption to give an increased
stimulant to their pleasures

It signifies not resumed the princess since as you say a great
day is at hand bringing nearly forty millions of which the Order can
become possessed by the happy success of the affair of the medals We
certainly can attempt very great things Like a lever in your hands
such a means of action would be of incalculable power in times during
which all men buy and sell one another

And then resumed M dAigrigny with a thoughtful air here the
reaction continues the example of France is everything In Austria and
Holland we can rarely maintain ourselves while the resources of the
Order diminish from day to day We have arrived at a crisis but it can
be made to prolong itself Thus thanks to the immense resource of the
affair of the medals we can not only brave all eventualities but we
can again powerfully establish ourselves thanks to the offer of the
Duke dOrbano which we accept and then from that inassailable centre
our radiations will be incalculable Ah the 13th of February added M
dAigrigny after a moment of silence and shaking his head the 13th
of February a date perhaps fortunate and famous for our power as that
of the council which gave to us so to say a new life

And nothing must be spared resumed the princess in order to succeed
at any price Of the six persons whom we have to fear five are or will
be out of any condition to hurt us There remains then only my niece
and you know that I have waited but for your arrival in order to take
my last resolution All my preparations are completed and this very
morning we will begin to act

Have your suspicions increased since your last letter

Yes I am certain that she is more instructed than she wishes to
appear and if so we shall not have a more dangerous enemy

Such has always been my opinion Thus it is six month since I advised
you to take in all cases the measures which you have adopted in order
to provoke on her part that demand of emancipation the consequences
of which now render quite easy that which would have been impossible
without it

At last said the princess with an expression of joy hateful and
bitter this indomitable spirit will be broken I am at length about to
be avenged of the many insolent sarcasms which I have been compelled to
swallow lest I should awaken her suspicions I I to have borne so much
till now for this Adrienne has made it her business imprudent as she
is to irritate me against herself

Whosoever offends you offends me you know it said DAigrigny my
hatreds are yours

And you yourself said the princess how many times have you been the
butt of her poignant irony

My instincts seldom deceive me I am certain that this young girl
may become a dangerous enemy for us said the marquis with a voice
painfully broken into short monosyllables

And therefore it is necessary that she may be rendered incapable
of exciting further fear responded Madame de SaintDizier fixedly
regarding the marquis

Have you seen Dr Baleinier and the subguardian M Tripeaud asked
he

They will be here this morning I have informed them of everything

Did you find them well disposed to act against her

Perfectly soand the best is Adrienne does not at all suspect the
doctor who has known how up to a certain point to preserve her
confidence Moreover a circumstance which appears to me inexplicable
has come to our aid

What do you allude to

This morning Mrs Grivois went according to my orders to remind
Adrienne that I expected her at noon upon important business As she
approached the pavilion Mrs Grivois saw or thought she saw Adrienne
come in by the little gardengate

What do you tell me Is it possible Is there any positive proof of
it cried the marquis

Till now there is no other proof than the spontaneous declaration of
Mrs Grivois but whilst I think of it said the Princess taking up a
paper that lay before her here is the report which every day one of
Adriennes women makes to me

The one that Rodin succeeded in introducing into your nieces service

The same as this creature is entirely in Rodins hands she has
hitherto answered our purpose very well In this report we shall
perhaps find the confirmation of what Mrs Grivois affirms she saw

Hardly had the Princess glanced at the note than she exclaimed almost
in terror What do I see Why Adrienne is a very demon

What now

The bailiff at Cardoville having written to my niece to ask her
recommendation informed her at the same time of the stay of the Indian
prince at the castle She knows that he is her relation and has just
written to her old drawingmaster Norval to set out post with Eastern
dresses and bring Prince Djalma hitherthe man that must be kept away
from Paris at any cost

The marquis grew pale and said to Mme de SaintDizier If this be not
merely one of her whims the eagerness she displays in sending for this
relation hither proves that she knows more than you even suspected She
is posted on the affair of the medals Have a careshe may ruin all

In that case said the princess resolutely there is no room to
hesitate We must carry things further than we thought and make an end
this very morning

Yes though it is almost impossible

Nay all is possible The doctor and M Tripeaud are ours said the
princess hastily

Though I am as sure as you are of the doctor or of M Tripeaud
under present circumstances we must not touch on the question of
actingwhich will be sure to frighten them at firstuntil after
our interview with your niece It will be easy notwithstanding her
cleverness to find out her armors defect If our suspicions should be
realizedif she is really informed of what it would be so dangerous for
her to knowthen we must have no scruples and above all no delay This
very day must see all set at rest The time for wavering is past

Have you been able to send for the person agreed on asked the
princess after a moments silence

He was to be here at noon He cannot be long

I thought this room would do very well for our purpose It is separated
from the smaller parlor by a curtain only behind which your man may be
stationed

Capital

Is he a man to be depended on

Quite sowe have often employed him in similar matters He is as
skillful as discreet

At this moment a low knock was heard at the door

Come in said the princess

Dr Baleinier wishes to know if her Highness the Princess can receive
him asked the valetdechambre

Certainly Beg him to walk in

There is also a gentleman that M lAbbe appointed to be here at noon
by whose orders I have left him waiting in the oratory

Tis the person in question said the marquis to the princess We
must have him in first Twould be useless for Dr Baleinier to see him
at present

Show this person in first said the princess next when I ring
the bell you will beg Dr Baleinier to walk this way and if Baron
Tripeaud should call you will bring him here also After that I am at
home to no one except Mdlle Adrienne The servant went out

CHAPTER XXXVIII ADRIENNES ENEMIES

The Princess de SaintDiziers valet soon returned showing in a little
pale man dressed in black and wearing spectacles He carried under his
left arm a long black morocco writingcase

The princess said to this man M lAbbe I suppose has already
informed you of what is to be done

Yes your highness said the man in a faint shrill piping voice
making at the same time a low bow

Shall you be conveniently placed in this room asked the princess
conducting him to the adjoining apartment which was only separated from
the other by a curtain hung before a doorway

I shall do nicely here your highness answered the man in spectacles
with a second and still lower bow

In that case sir please to step in here I will let you know when it
is time

I shall wait your highnesss order

And pray remember my instructions added the marquis as he unfastened
the loops of the curtain

You may be perfectly tranquil M lAbbe The heavy drapery as it
fell completely concealed the man in spectacles

The princess touched the bell some moments after the door opened and
the servant announced a very important personage in this work

Dr Baleinier was about fifty years of age middling size rather plump
with a full shining ruddy countenance His gray hair very smooth and
rather long parted by a straight line in the middle fell flat over
his temples He had retained the fashion of wearing short black silk
breeches perhaps because he had a wellformed leg his garters were
fastened with small golden buckles as were his shoes of polished
morocco leather his coat waistcoat and cravat were black which gave
him rather a clerical appearance his sleek white hand was half hidden
beneath a cambric ruffle very closely plaited on the whole the
gravity of his costume did not seem to exclude a shade of foppery

His face was acute and smiling his small gray eye announced rare
penetration and sagacity A man of the world and a man of pleasure
a delicate epicure witty in conversation polite to obsequiousness
supple adroit insinuating Baleinier was one of the oldest favorites
of the congregational set of the Princess de SaintDizier Thanks to
this powerful support its cause unknown the doctor who had been
long neglected in spite of real skill and incontestable merit found
himself under the Restoration suddenly provided with two medical
sinecures most valuable and soon after with numerous patients We must
add that once under the patronage of the princess the doctor began
scrupulously to observe his religious duties he communicated once a
week with great publicity at the high mass in Saint Thomas Aquinas
Church

At the years end a certain class of patients led by the example and
enthusiasm of Madame de SaintDiziers followers would have no other
physician than Doctor Baleinier and his practice was now increased to
an extraordinary degree It may be conceived how important it was for
the order to have amongst its plain clothes members one of the most
popular practitioners of Paris

A doctor has in some sort a priesthood of his own Admitted at all hours
to the most secret intimacy of families he knows guesses and is able
to effect much Like the priest in short he has the ear of the sick
and the dying Now when he who cares for the health of the body and he
who takes charge of the health of the soul understands each other and
render mutual aid for the advancement of a common interest there is
nothing with certain exceptions which they may not extract from the
weakness and fears of a sick man at the last gaspnot for themselves
the laws forbid itbut for third parties belonging more or less
to the very convenient class of men of straw Doctor Baleinier was
therefore one of the most active and valuable assistant members of the
Paris Jesuits

When he entered the room he hastened to kiss the princesss hand with
the most finished gallantry

Always punctual my dear M Baleinier

Always eager and happy to attend to your highnesss orders Then
turning towards the marquis whose hand he pressed cordially he added
Here we have you then at last Do you know that three months absence
appears very long to your friends

The time is as long to the absent as to those who remain my dear
doctor Well here is the great day Mdlle de Cardoville is coming

I am not quite easy said the princess suppose she had any
suspicion

Thats impossible said M Baleinier we are the best friends in the
world You know that Mdlle Adrienne has always had great confidence in
me The day before yesterday we laughed a good deal and as I made some
observations to her as usual on her eccentric mode of life and on the
singular state of excitement in which I sometimes found her

M Baleinier never fails to insist on these circumstances in
appearance so insignificant said Madame de SaintDizier to the marquis
with a meaning look

They are indeed very essential replied the other

Mdlle Adrienne answered my observations resumed the doctor by
laughing at me in the gayest and most witty manner for I must confess
that this young lady has one of the aptest and most accomplished minds I
know

Doctor doctor said Madame de SaintDizier no weakness

Instead of answering immediately M Baleinier drew his gold snuffbox
from his waistcoat pocket opened it and took slowly a pinch of snuff
looking all the time at the princess with so significant an air that
she appeared quite reassured Weakness madame observed he at last
brushing some grains of snuff from his shirtfront with his plump white
hand did I not have the honor of volunteering to extricate you from
this embarrassment

And you are the only person in the world that could render us this
important service said DAigrigny

Your highness sees therefore resumed the doctor that I am not
likely to show any weakness I perfectly understand the responsibility
of what I undertake but such immense interests you told me were at
stake

Yes said DAigrigny interests of the first consequence

Therefore I did not hesitate proceeded M Baleinier and you need
not be at all uneasy As a man of taste accustomed to good society
allow me to render homage to the charming qualities of Mdlle Adrienne
when the time for action comes you will find me quite as willing to do
my work

Perhaps that moment may be nearer than we thought said Madame de
SaintDizier exchanging a glance with DAigrigny

I am and will be always ready said the doctor I answer for
everything that concerns myself I wish I could be as tranquil on every
other point

Is not your asylum still as fashionableas an asylum can well be
asked Madame de SaintDizier with a half smile

On the contrary I might almost complain of having too many boarders
It is not that But whilst we are waiting for Mdlle Adrienne I will
mention another subject which only relates to her indirectly for
it concerns the person who bought Cardoville Manor one Madame de la
SainteColombe who has taken me for a doctor thanks to Rodins able
management

True said DAigrigny Rodin wrote to me on the subjectbut without
entering into details

These are the facts resumed the doctor This Madame de la Sainte
Colombe who was at first considered easy enough to lead has shown
herself very refractory on the head of her conversion Two spiritual
directors have already renounced the task of saving her soul In
despair Rodin unslipped little Philippon on her He is adroit
tenacious and above all patient in the extremethe very man that was
wanted When I got Madame de la SainteColombe for a patient Philippon
asked my aid which he was naturally entitled to We agreed upon our
plan I was not to appear to know him the least in the world and he
was to keep me informed of the variations in the moral state of his
penitent so that I might be able by the use of very inoffensive
medicinesfor there was nothing dangerous in the illnessto keep my
patient in alternate states of improvement or the reverse according as
her director had reason to be satisfied or displeasedso that he might
say to her You see madame you are in the good way Spiritual grace
acts upon your bodily health and you are already better If on the
contrary you fall back into evil courses you feel immediately some
physical ail which is a certain proof of the powerful influence of
faith not only on the soul but on the body also

It is doubtless painful said DAigrigny with perfect coolness to
be obliged to have recourse to such means to rescue perverse souls
from perditionbut we must needs proportion our modes of action to the
intelligence and the character of the individual

Bythebye the princess knows resumed the doctor that I have often
pursued this plan at St Marys Convent to the great advantage of
the souls peace and health of some of our patients being extremely
innocent These alternations never exceed the difference between pretty
well and not quite so well Yet small as are the variations they
act most efficaciously on certain minds It was thus with Madame de la
SainteColombe She was in such a fair way of recovery both moral
and physical that Rodin thought he might get Philippon to advise
the country for his penitent fearing that Paris air might occasion a
relapse This advice added to the desire the woman had to play lady of
the parish induced her to buy Cardoville Manor a good investment in
any respect But yesterday unfortunate Philippon came to tell me that
Madame de la SainteColombe was about to have an awful relapsemoral
of coursefor her physical health is now desperately good The said
relapse appears to have been occasioned by an interview she has had with
one Jacques Dumoulin whom they tell me you know my dear abbe he has
introduced himself to her nobody can guess how

This Jacques Dumoulin said the marquis with disgust is one of
those men that we employ while we despise He is a writer full of gall
envy and hate qualities that give him a certain unmercifully cutting
eloquence We pay him largely to attack our enemies though it is often
painful to see principles we respect defended by such a pen For this
wretch lives like a vagabondis constantly in tavernsalmost always
intoxicatedbut I must own his power of abuse is inexhaustible and
he is well versed in the most abstruse theological controversies so
that he is sometimes very useful to us

Well though Madame de la SainteColombe is hard upon sixty it appears
that Dumoulin has matrimonial views on her large fortune You will do
well to inform Rodin so that he may be on his guard against the dark
designs of this rascal I really beg a thousand pardons for having so
long occupied you with such a paltry affairbut talking of St Marys
Convent added the doctor addressing the princess may I take the
liberty of asking if your highness has been there lately

The princess exchanged a rapid glance with DAigrigny and answered
Oh let me see Yes I was there about a week ago

You will find great changes then The wall that was next to my asylum
has been taken down for they are going to build anew wing and a chapel
the old one being too small I must say in praise of Mdlle Adrienne
continued the doctor with a singular smile aside that she promised me
a copy of one of Raphaels Madonnas for this chapel

Really very appropriate said the princess But here it is almost
noon and M Tripeaud has not come

He is the deputyguardian of Mdlle de Cardoville whose property he
has managed as former agent of the countduke said the marquis with
evident anxiety and his presence here is absolutely indispensable It
is greatly to be desired that his coming should precede that of Mdlle
de Cardoville who may be here at any moment

It is unlucky that his portrait will not do as well said the doctor
smiling maliciously and drawing a small pamphlet from his pocket

What is that doctor asked the princess

One of those anonymous sheets which are published from time to time
It is called the Scourge and Baron Tripeauds portrait is drawn with
such faithfulness that it ceases to be satire It is really quite life
like you have only to listen The sketch is entitled TYPE OF THE LYNX
SPECIES

The Baron TripeaudThis man who is as basely humble towards his
social superiors as he is insolent and coarse to those who depend upon
himis the living frightful incarnation of the worst pardon of
the moneyed and commercial aristocracyone of the rich and cynical
speculators without heart faith or conscience who would speculate for
a rise or fall on the death of his mother if the death of his mother
could influence the price of stocks

Such persons have all the odious vices of men suddenly elevated not
like those whom honest and patient labor has nobly enriched but like
those who owe their wealth to some blind caprice of fortune or some
lucky cast of the net in the miry waters of stockjobbing

Once up in the world they hate the peoplebecause the people remind
them of a mushroom origin of which they are ashamed Without pity for
the dreadful misery of the masses they ascribe it wholly to idleness
or debauchery because this calumny forms an excuse for their barbarous
selfishness

And this is not all On the strength of his wellfilled safe mounted
on his right of the candidate Baron Tripeaud insults the poverty and
political disfranchisementof the officer who after forty years of
wars and hard service is just able to live on a scanty pensionOf the
magistrate who has consumed his strength in the discharge of stern and
sad duties and who is not better remunerated in his litter daysOf the
learned man who has made his country illustrious by useful labors
or the professor who has initiated entire generations in the various
branches of human knowledgeOf the modest and virtuous country curate
the pure representative of the gospel in its charitable fraternal and
democratic tendencies etc

In such a state of things how should our shoddy baron of industry
not feel the most sovereign contempt for all that stupid mob of honest
folk who having given to their country their youth their mature age
their blood their intelligence their learning see themselves deprived
of the rights which he enjoys because he has gained a million by unfair
and illegal transactions

It is true that your optimists say to these pariahs of civilization
whose proud and noble poverty cannot be too much revered and honored
Buy an estate and you too may be electors and candidates

But to come to the biography of our worthy baronAndrew Tripeaud the
son of an ostler at a roadside inn

At this instant the foldingdoors were thrown open and the valet
announced The Baron Tripeaud

Dr Baleinier put his pamphlet into his pocket made the most cordial
bow to the financier and even rose to give him his hand The baron
entered the room overwhelming every one with salutations I have the
honor to attend the orders of your highness the princess She knows that
she may always count upon me

I do indeed rely upon you M Tripeaud and particularly under present
circumstances

If the intentions of your highness the princess are still the same with
regard to Mdlle de Cardoville

They are still the same M Tripeaud and we meet today on that
subject

Your highness may be assured of my concurrence as indeed I have
already promised I think that the greatest severity must at length be
employed and that even if it were necessary

That is also our opinion said the marquis hastily making a sign to
the princess and glancing at the place where the man in spectacles was
hidden we are all perfectly in harmony Still we must not leave any
point doubtful for the sake of the young lady herself whose interests
alone guides us in this affair We must draw out her sincerity by every
possible means

Mademoiselle has just arrived from the summerhouse and wishes to see
your highness said the valet again entering after having knocked at
the door

Say that I wait for her answered the princess and now I am at home
to no onewithout exception You understand me absolutely to no one

Thereupon approaching the curtain behind which the man was concealed
Mme de SaintDizier gave him the cueafter which she returned to her
seat

It is singular but during the short space which preceded Adriennes
arrival the different actors in this scene appeared uneasy and
embarrassed as if they had a vague fear of her coming In about a
minute Mdlle de Cardoville entered the presence of her aunt




CHAPTER XXXIX THE SKIRMISH

On entering Mdlle de Cardoville threw down upon a chair the gray
beaver hat she had worn to cross the garden and displayed her fine
golden hair falling on either side of her face in long light ringlets
and twisted in a broad knot behind her head She presented herself
without boldness but with perfect ease her countenance was gay and
smiling her large black eyes appeared even more brilliant than usual
When she perceived Abbe dAigrigny she started in surprise and her
rosy lips were just touched with a mocking smile

After nodding graciously to the doctor she passed Baron Tripeaud by
without looking at him and saluted the princess with stately obeisance
in the most fashionable style

Though the walk and bearing of Mdlle de Cardoville were extremely
elegant and full of propriety and truly feminine grace there was about
her an air of resolution and independence by no means common in women
and particularly in girls of her age Her movements without being
abrupt bore no traces of restraint stiffness or formality They were
frank and free as her character full of life youth and freshness and
one could easily divine that so buoyant straightforward and decided a
nature had never been able to conform itself to the rules of an affected
rigor

Strangely enough though he was a man of the world a man of great
talent a churchman distinguished for his eloquence and above all
a person of influence and authority Marquis dAigrigny experienced
an involuntary incredible almost painful uneasiness in presence of
Adrienne de Cardoville Hegenerally so much the master of himself so
accustomed to exercise great powerwho in the name of his Order
had often treated with crowned heads on the footing of an equal felt
himself abashed and lowered in the presence of this girl as remarkable
for her frankness as for her biting irony Now as men who are
accustomed to impose their will upon others generally hate those who
far from submitting to their influence hamper it and make sport of
them it was no great degree of affection that the marquis bore towards
the Princess de SaintDiziers niece

For a long time past contrary to his usual habit he had ceased to try
upon Adrienne that fascinating address to which he had often owed an
irresistible charm towards her he had become dry curt serious taking
refuge in that icy sphere of haughty dignity and rigid austerity which
completely hid all those amiable qualities with which he was endowed
and of which in general he made such efficient use Adrienne was much
amused at all this and thereby showed her imprudencefor the most
vulgar motives often engender the most implacable hatreds

From these preliminary observations the reader will understand the
divers sentiments and interests which animated the different actors in
the following scene

Madame de SaintDizier was seated in a large armchair by one side
of the hearth Marquis dAigrigny was standing before the fire Dr
Baleinier seated near a bureau was again turning over the leaves
of Baron Tripeauds biography whilst the baron appeared to be very
attentively examining one of the pictures of sacred subjects suspended
from the wall

You sent for me aunt to talk upon matters of importance said
Adrienne breaking the silence which had reigned in the receptionroom
since her entrance

Yes madame answered the princess with a cold and severe mien upon
matters of the gravest importance

I am at your service aunt Perhaps we had better walk into your
library

It is not necessary We can talk here Then addressing the marquis
the doctor and the baron she said to them Pray be seated
gentlemen and they all took their places round the table

How can the subject of our interview interest these gentlemen aunt
asked Mdlle de Cardoville with surprise

These gentlemen are old family friends all that concerns you must
interest them and their advice ought to be heard and accepted by you
with respect

I have no doubt aunt of the bosom friendship of M dAigrigny for our
family I have still less of the profound and disinterested devotion
of M Tripeaud M Baleinier is one of my old friends still before
accepting these gentlemen as spectators or if you will as confidants
of our interview I wish to know what we are going to talk of before
them

I thought that among your many singular pretensions you had at least
those of frankness and courage

Really aunt said Adrienne smiling with mock humility I have no
more pretensions to frankness and courage than you have to sincerity and
goodness Let us admit once for all that we are what we arewithout
pretension

Be it so said Madame de SaintDizier in a dry tone I have long
been accustomed to the freaks of your independent spirit I suppose
then that courageous and frank as you say you are you will not be
afraid to speak before such grave and respectable persons as these
gentlemen what you would speak to me alone

Is it a formal examination that I am to submit to if so upon what
subject

It is not an examination but as I have a right to watch over you and
as you take advantage of my weak compliance with your caprices I mean
to put an end to what has lasted too long and tell you my irrevocable
resolutions for the future in presence of friends of the family And
first you have hitherto had a very false and imperfect notion of my
power over you

I assure you aunt that I have never had any notion true or false on
the subjectfor I have never even dreamt about it

That is my own fault for instead of yielding to your fancies I
should have made you sooner feel my authority but the moment has come
to submit yourself the severe censures of my friends have enlightened
me in time Your character is selfwilled independent stubborn it
must changeeither by fair means or by force understand me it shall
change

At these words pronounced harshly before strangers with a severity
which did not seem at all justified by circumstances Adrienne tossed
her head proudly but restraining herself she answered with a smile
You say aunt that I shall change I should not be astonished at it
We hear of such odd conversions

The princess bit her lips

A sincere conversion can never be called odd as you term it madame
said Abbe dAigrigny coldly It is on the contrary meritorious and
forms an excellent example

Excellent answered Adrienne that depends For instance what if one
converts defects into vices

What do you mean madame cried the princess

I am speaking of myself aunt you reproach me of being independent and
resolutesuppose I were to become hypocritical and wicked In truth
I prefer keeping my dear little faults which I love like spoiled
children I know what I am I do not know what I might be

But you must acknowledge Mdlle Adrienne said Baron Tripeaud with a
selfconceited and sententious air that a conversion

I believe said Adrienne disdainfully that M Tripeaud is well
versed in the conversion of all sorts of property into all sorts of
profit by all sorts of meansbut he knows nothing of this matter

But madame resumed the financier gathering courage from a glance
of the princess you forget that I have the honor to be your deputy
guardian and that

It is true that M Tripeaud has that honor said Adrienne with still
more haughtiness and not even looking at the baron I could never tell
exactly why But as it is not now the time to guess enigmas I wish to
know aunt the object and the end of this meeting

You shall be satisfied madame I will explain myself in a very clear
and precise manner You shall know the plan of conduct that you will
have henceforth to pursue and if you refuse to submit thereto with the
obedience and respect that is due to my orders I shall at once see what
course to take

It is impossible to give an idea of the imperious tone and stern look
of the princess as she pronounced these words which were calculated to
startle a girl until now accustomed to live in a great measure as she
pleased yet contrary perhaps to the expectation of Madame de Saint
Dizier instead of answering impetuously Adrienne looked her full in
the face and said laughing This is a perfect declaration of war
Its becoming very amusing

We are not talking of declarations of war said the Abbe dAigrigny
harshly as if offended by the expressions of Mdlle de Cardoville

Now M lAbbe returned Adrienne for an old colonel you are really
too severe upon a jestyou are so much indebted to war which gave
you a French regiment after fighting so long against Francein order to
learn of course the strength and the weakness of her enemies

On these words which recalled painful remembrances the marquis
colored he was going to answer but the princess exclaimed Really
madame your behavior is quite intolerable

Well aunt I acknowledge I was wrong I ought not to have said this
is very amusingfor it is not so at all but it is at least very
curiousand perhaps added the young girl after a moments silence
perhaps very audacious and audacity pleases me As we are upon this
subject and you talk of a plan of conduct to which I must conform
myself under pain of interrupting herselfunder pain of what I
should like to know aunt

You shall know Proceed

I will in the presence of these gentlemen also declare in a very
plain and precise manner the determination that I have come to As it
required some time to prepare for its execution I have not spoken of it
sooner for you know I am not in the habit of saying I will do so and
so but I do it

Certainly and it is just this habit of culpable independence of which
you must break yourself

Well I had intended only to inform you of my determination at a later
period but I cannot resist the pleasure of doing so today you seem so
well disposed to hear and receive it Still I would beg of you to speak
first it may just so happen that our views are precisely the same

I like better to see you thus said the princess I acknowledge at
least the courage of your pride and your defiance of all authority You
speak of audacityyours is indeed great

I am at least decided to do that which others in their weakness dare
notbut which I dare This I hope is clear and precise

Very clear very precise said the princess exchanging a glance of
satisfaction with the other actors in this scene The positions being
thus established matters will be much simplified I have only to
give you notice in your own interest that this is a very serious
affairmuch more so than you imagineand that the only way to dispose
me to indulgence is to substitute for the habitual arrogance and irony
of your language the modesty and respect becoming a young lady

Adrienne smiled but made no reply Some moments of silence and some
rapid glances exchanged between the princess and her three friends
showed that these encounters more or less brilliant in themselves were
to be followed by a serious combat

Mdlle de Cardoville had too much penetration and sagacity not
to remark that the Princess de SaintDizier attached the greatest
importance to this decisive interview But she could not understand how
her aunt could hope to impose her absolute will upon her the threat of
coercive measures appearing with reason a mere ridiculous menace Yet
knowing the vindictive character of her aunt the secret power at
her disposal and the terrible vengeance she had sometimes
exactedreflecting moreover that men in the position of the marquis
and the doctor would not have come to attend this interview without some
weighty motivethe young lady paused for a moment before she plunged
into the strife

But soon the very presentiment of some vague danger far from weakening
her gave her new courage to brave the worst to exaggerate if that
were possible the independence of her ideas and uphold come what
might the determination that she was about to signify to the Princess
de Saint Dizier




CHAPTER XL THE REVOLT

Madame said the princess to Adrienne de Cardoville in a cold
severe tone I owe it to myself as well as to these gentlemen to
recapitulate in a few words the events that have taken place for some
time past Six months ago at the end of the mourning for your father
you being eighteen years old asked for the management of your fortune
and for emancipation from control Unfortunately I had the weakness
to consent You quitted the house and established yourself in
the extension far from all superintendence Then began a train of
expenditures each one more extravagant than the last Instead of being
satisfied with one or two waitingwomen taken from that class
from which they are generally selected you chose governesses for
ladycompanions whom you dressed in the most ridiculous and costly
fashion It is true that in the solitude of your pavilion you
yourself chose to wear one after another costumes of different ages
Your foolish fancies and unreasonable whims have been without end and
without limit not only have you never fulfilled your religious duties
but you have actually had the audacity to profane one of your rooms
by rearing in the centre of it a species of pagan altar on which is a
group in marble representing a youth and a girlthe princess uttered
these words as if they would burn her lipsa work of art if you will
but a work in the highest degree unsuitable to a person of your age You
pass whole days entirely secluded in your pavilion refusing to see any
one and Dr Baleinier the only one of my friends in whom you seem to
have retained some confidence having succeeded by much persuasion in
gaining admittance has frequently found you in so very excited a state
that he has felt seriously uneasy with regard to your health You have
always insisted on going out alone without rendering any account of
your actions to any one You have taken delight in opposing in every
possible way your will to my authority Is all this true

The picture of my past is not much flattered said Adrienne smiling
but it is not altogether unlike

So you admit madame said Abbe dAigrigny laying stress on his
words that all the facts stated by your aunt are scrupulously true

Every eye was turned towards Adrienne as if her answer would be of
extreme importance

Yes M lAbbe said she I live openly enough to render this
question superfluous

These facts are therefore admitted said Abbe dAigrigny turning
towards the doctor and the baron

These facts are completely established said M Tripeaud in a pompous
voice

Will you tell me aunt asked Adrienne what is the good of this long
preamble

This long preamble madame resumed the princess with dignity
exposes the past in order to justify the future

Really aunt such mysterious proceedings are a little in the style
of the answers of the Cumaean Sybil They must be intended to cover
something formidable

Perhaps mademoisellefor to certain characters nothing is so
formidable as duty and obedience Your character is one of those
inclined to revolt

I freely acknowledge it auntand it will always be so until duty and
obedience come to me in a shape that I can respect and love

Whether you respect and love my orders or not madame said the
princess in a curt harsh voice you will from today from this
moment learn to submit blindly and absolutely to my will In one word
you will do nothing without my permission it is necessary I insist
upon it and so I am determined it shall be

Adrienne looked at her aunt for a second and then burst into so free
and sonorous a laugh that it rang for quite a time through the vast
apartment DAigrigny and Baron Tripeaud started in indignation The
princess looked angrily at her niece The doctor raised his eyes to
heaven and clasped his hands over his waistcoat with a sanctimonious
sigh

Madame said Abbe dAigrigny such fits of laughter are highly
unbecoming Your aunts words are serious and deserve a different
reception

Oh sir said Adrienne recovering herself it is not my fault if
I laugh How can I maintain my gravity when I hear my aunt talking
of blind submission to her orders Is the swallow accustomed to
fly upwards and enjoy the sunshine fledged to live with the mole in
darkness

At this answer DAigrigny affected to stare at the other members of
this kind of family council with blank astonishment

A swallow what does she mean asked the abbe of the baron making a
sign which the latter understood

I do not know answered Tripeaud staring in his turn at the doctor
She spoke too of a mole It is quite unheardofincomprehensible

And so madame said the princess appearing to share in the surprise
of the others this is the reply that you make to me

Certainly answered Adrienne astonished herself that they should
pretend not to understand the simile of which she had made use
accustomed as she was to speak in figurative language

Come come madame said Dr Baleinier smiling goodhumoredly we
must be indulgent My dear Mdlle Adrienne has naturally so uncommon and
excitable a nature She is really the most charming mad woman I know I
have told her so a hundred times in my position of an old friend which
allows such freedom

I can conceive that your attachment makes you indulgentbut it is
not the less true doctor said DAigrigny as if reproaching him for
taking the part of Mdlle de Cardoville that such answers to serious
questions are most extravagant

The evil is that mademoiselle does not seem to comprehend the serious
nature of this conference said the princess harshly She will
perhaps understand it better when I have given her my orders

Let us hear these orders aunt replied Adrienne as seated on the
other side of the table opposite to the princess she leaned her small
dimpled chin in the hollow of her pretty hand with an air of graceful
mockery charming to behold

From tomorrow forward resumed the princess you will quit the
summerhouse which you at present inhabit you will discharge your
women and come and occupy two rooms in this house to which there will
be no access except through my apartment You will never go out alone
You will accompany me to the services of the church Your emancipation
terminates in consequence of your prodigality duly proven I will take
charge of all your expenses even to the ordering of your clothes
so that you may be properly and modestly dressed Until your majority
which will be indefinitely postponed by means of the intervention of a
familycouncil you will have no money at your own disposal Such is my
resolution

And certainly your resolution can only be applauded madame said
Baron Tripeaud we can but encourage you to show the greatest firmness
for such disorders must have an end

It is more than time to put a stop to such scandal added the abbe

Eccentricity and exaltation of temperamentmay excuse many things
ventured to observe the smoothtongued doctor

No doubt replied the princess dryly to Baleinier who played his part
to perfection but then doctor the requisite measures must be taken
with such characters

Madame de SaintDizier had expressed herself in a firm and precise
manner she appeared convinced of the possibility of putting her threats
into execution M Tripeaud and DAigrigny had just now given their full
consent to the words of the princess Adrienne began to perceive that
something very serious was in contemplation and her gayety was at once
replaced by an air of bitter irony and offended independence

She rose abruptly and colored a little her rosy nostrils dilated her
eyes flashed fire and as she raised her head she gently shook the
fine wavy golden hair with a movement of pride that was natural to
her After a moments silence she said to her aunt in a cutting tone
You have spoken of the past madame I also will speak a few words
concerning it since you force me to do so though I may regret the
necessity I quitted your dwelling because it was impossible for me to
live longer in this atmosphere of dark hypocrisy and black treachery

Madame said DAigrigny such words are as violent as they are
unreasonable

Since you interrupt me sir said Adrienne hastily as she fixed her
eyes on the abbe tell me what examples did I meet with in my aunts
house

Excellent examples madame

Excellent sir Was it because I saw there every day her conversion
keep pace with your own

Madame you forget yourself cried the princess becoming pale with
rage

Madame I do not forgetI remember like other people that is all I
had no relation of whom I could ask an asylum I wished to live alone
I wished to enjoy my revenuesbecause I chose rather to spend them
myself than to see them wasted by M Tripeaud

Madame cried the baron I cannot imagine how you can presume

Sir said Adrienne reducing him to silence by a gesture of
overwhelming lordliness I speak of younot to you I wished to spend
my income she continued according to my own tastes I embellished
the retreat that I had chosen Instead of ugly illtaught servants I
selected girls pretty and well brought up though poor Their education
forbade their being subjected to any humiliating servitude though I
have endeavored to make their situation easy and agreeable They do
not serve me but render me serviceI pay them but I am obliged to
themnice distinctions that your highness will not understand I know
Instead of seeing them badly or ungracefully dressed I have given them
clothes that suit their charming faces well because I like whatever is
young and fair Whether I dress myself one way or the other concerns
only my lookingglass I go out alone because I like to follow my
fancy I do not go to massbut if I had still a mother I would
explain to her my devotions and she would kiss me none the less
tenderly It is true that I have raised a pagan altar to youth and
beauty because I adore God in all that He has made fair and good noble
and grandbecause morn and evening my heart repeats the fervent and
sincere prayer Thanks my Creator thanksYour highness says that
M Baleinier has often found me in my solitude a prey to a strange
excitement yes it is true for it is then that escaping in thought
from all that renders the present odious and painful to me I find
refuge in the futureit is then that magical horizons spread far before
meit is then that such splendid visions appear to me as make me
feel myself rapt in a sublime and heavenly ecstasy as if I no longer
appertained to earth

As Adrienne pronounced these last words with enthusiasm her countenance
appeared transfigured so resplendent did it become In that moment she
had lost sight of all that surrounded her

It is then she resumed with spirit soaring higher and higher that
I breathe a pure air reviving and freeyes freeabove all freeand
so salubrious so grateful to the soulYes instead of seeing my
sisters painfully submit to a selfish humiliating brutal dominion
which entails upon them the seductive vices of slavery the graceful
fraud the enchanting perfidy the caressing falsehood the contemptuous
resignation the hateful obedienceI behold them my noble sisters
worthy and sincere because they are free faithful and devoted because
they have liberty to chooseneither imperious not base because they
have no master to govern or to flattercherished and respected because
they can withdraw from a disloyal hand their hand loyally bestowed
Oh my sisters my sisters I feel it These are not merely consoling
visionsthey are sacred hopes

Carried away in spite of herself by the excitement of her feelings
Adrienne paused for a moment in order to return to earth she did not
perceive that the other actors in this scene were looking at each other
with an air of delight

What she says there is excellent murmured the doctor in the
princesss ear next to whom he was seated were she in league with us
she would not speak differently

It is only by excessive harshness added DAigrigny that we shall
bring her to the desired point

But it seemed as if the vexed emotion of Adrienne had been dissipated by
the contact of the generous sentiments she had just uttered Addressing
Baleinier with a smile she said I must own doctor that there
is nothing more ridiculous than to yield to the current of certain
thoughts in the presence of persons incapable of understanding them
This would give you a fine opportunity to make game of that exaltation
of mind for which you sometimes reproach me To let myself be carried
away by transports at so serious a momentfor verily the matter in
hand seems to be serious But you see good M Baleinier when an idea
comes into my head I can no more help following it out than I could
refrain from running after butterflies when I was a little girl

And heaven only knows whither these brilliant butterflies of all
colors said M Baleinier smiling with an air of paternal indulgence
that are passing through your brain are likely to lead you Oh
madcap when will she be as reasonable as she is charming

This very instant my good doctor replied Adrienne I am about
to cast off my reveries for realities and speak plain and positive
language as you shall hear

Upon which addressing her aunt she continued You have imparted to
me your resolution madame I will now tell you mine Within a week
I shall quit the pavilion that I inhabit for a house which I have
arranged to my taste where I shall live after my own fashion I have
neither father nor mother and I owe no account of my actions to any but
myself

Upon my word mademoiselle said the princess shrugging her
shoulders you talk nonsense You forget that society has inalienable
moral rights which we are bound to enforce And we shall not neglect
them depend upon it

So madame it is you and M dAigrigny and M Tripeaud that
represent the morality of society This appears to me very fine Is it
because M Tripeaud has considered I must acknowledge it my fortune as
his own Is it because

Now really madame began Tripeaud

In good time madame said Adrienne to her aunt without noticing the
baron as the occasion offers I shall have to ask you for explanations
with regard to certain interests which have hitherto I think been
concealed from me

These words of Adrienne made DAigrigny and the princess start and then
rapidly exchange a glance of uneasiness and anxiety Adrienne did
not seem to perceive it but thus continued To have done with your
demands madame here is my final resolve I shall live where and how I
please I think that if I were a man no one would impose on me at my
age the harsh and humiliating guardianship you have in view for living
as I have lived till nowhonestly freely and generously in the sight
of all

This idea is absurd is madness cried the princess To wish to
live thus alone is to carry immorality and immodesty to their utmost
limits

If so madame said Adrienne what opinion must you entertain of so
many poor girls orphans like myself who live alone and free as I
wish to live They have not received as I have a refined education
calculated to raise the soul and purify the heart They have not
wealth as I have to protect them from the evil temptations of misery
and yet they live honestly and proudly in their distress

Vice and virtue do not exist for such tagrag vermin cried Baron
Tripeaud with an expression of anger and hideous disdain

Madame you would turn away a lackey that would venture to speak thus
before you said Adrienne to her aunt unable to conceal her disgust
and yet you oblige me to listen to such speeches

The Marquis dAigrigny touched M Tripeaud with his knee under the
table to remind him that he must not express himself in the princesss
parlors in the same manner as he would in the lobbies of the Exchange
To repair the barons coarseness the abbe thus continued There is no
comparison mademoiselle between people of the class you name and a
young lady of your rank

For a Catholic priest M lAbbe that distinction is not very
Christian replied Adrienne

I know the purport of my words madame answered the abbe dryly
besides the independent life that you wish to lead in opposition to
all reason may tend to very serious consequences for you Your family
may one day wish to see you married

I will spare my family that trouble sir if I marry at all I will
choose for myself which also appears to me reasonable enough But in
truth I am very little tempted by that heavy chain which selfishness
and brutality rivet for ever about our necks

It is indecent madame said the princess to speak so lightly of
such an institution

Before you especially madame I beg pardon for having shocked your
highness You fear that my independent planner of living will frighten
away all wooers but that is another reason for persisting in my
independence for I detest wooers I only hope that they may have the
very worst opinion of me and there is no better means of effecting that
object than to appear to live as they live themselves I rely upon my
whims my follies my sweet faults to preserve me from the annoyance of
any matrimonial hunting

You will be quite satisfied on that head resumed Madame de Saint
Dizier if unfortunately the report should gain credit that you have
carried the forgetfulness of all duty and decency to such a height as
to return home at eight oclock in the morning So I am told is the case
but I cannot bring myself to believe such an enormity

You are wrong madame for it is quite true

So you confess it cried the princess

I confess all that I do madame I came home this morning at eight
oclock

You hear Gentlemen ejaculated the princess

Oh said M dAigrigny in a bass voice

Ah said the baron in a treble key

Oh muttered the doctor with a deep sigh

On hearing these lamentable exclamations Adrienne seemed about to
speak perhaps to justify herself but her lip speedily assumed a
curl of contempt which showed that she disdained to stoop to any
explanation

So it is true said the princess Oh wretched girl you had
accustomed me to be astonished at nothing but nevertheless I doubted
the possibility of such conduct It required your impudent and audacious
reply to convince the of the fact

Madame lying has always appeared to be more impudent than to speak the
truth

And where had you been madame and for what

Madame said Adrienne interrupting her aunt I never speak
falsebut neither do I speak more than I choose and then again it
were cowardice to defend myself from a revolting accusation Let us say
no more about it your importunities on this head will be altogether
vain To resume you wish to impose upon me a harsh and humiliating
restraint I wish to quit the house I inhabit to go and live where I
please at my own fancy Which of us two will yield remains to be seen
Now for another matter this mansion belongs to me As I am about to
leave it I am indifferent whether you continue to live here or not
but the ground floor is uninhabited It contains besides the
receptionrooms two complete sets of apartments I have let them for
some time

Indeed said the princess looking at DAigrigny with intense
surprise And to whom she added ironically have you disposed of
them

To three members of my family

What does all this mean said Mme de SaintDizier more and more
astonished

It means madame that I wish to offer a generous hospitality to a
young Indian prince my kinsman on my mothers side He will arrive in
two or three days and I wish to have the rooms ready to receive him

You hear gentlemen said DAigrigny to the doctor and Tripeaud with
an affectation of profound stupor

It surpasses all one could imagine exclaimed the baron

Alas observed the doctor benignantly the impulse is generous in
itselfbut the mad little head crops out

Excellent said the princes I cannot prevent you madame from
announcing the most extravagant designs but it is presumable that you
will not stop short in so fair a path Is that all

Not quite your highness I learned this morning that two of my female
relations also on my mothers sidepoor children of fifteenorphan
daughters of Marshal Simon arrived yesterday from a long journey and
are now with the wife of the brave soldier who brought them to France
from the depths of Siberia

At these words from Adrienne DAigrigny and the princess could not help
starting suddenly and staring at each other with affright so far were
they from expecting that Mdlle de Cardoville was informed of the coming
of Marshal Simons daughters This discovery was like a thunderclap to
them

You are no doubt astonished at seeing me so well informed said
Adrienne fortunately before I have done I hope to astonish you still
more But to return to these daughters of Marshal Simon your highness
will understand that it is impossible for me to leave them in charge of
the good people who have afforded them a temporary asylum Though this
family is honest and hardworking it is not the place for them I
shall go and fetch them hither and lodge them in apartments on the
groundfloor along with the soldiers wife who will do very well to
take care of them

Upon these words DAigrigny and the baron looked at each other and the
baron exclaimed Decidedly shes out of her head

Without a word to Tripeaud Adrienne continued Marshal Simon cannot
fail to arrive at Paris shortly Your highness perceives how pleasant it
will he to be able to present his daughters to him and prove that they
have been treated as they deserve Tomorrow morning I shall send for
milliners and mantua makers so that they may want for nothing I desire
their surprised father on his return to find them every way beautiful
They are pretty I am told as angelsbut I will endeavor to make
little Cupids of them

At last madame you must have finished said the princess in a
sardonic and deeply irritated tone whilst DAigrigny calm and cold in
appearance could hardly dissemble his mental anguish

Try again continued the princess addressing Adrienne Are there no
more relations that you wish to add to this interesting familygroup
Really a queen could not act with more magnificence

Right I wish to give my family a royal receptionsuch as is due to
the son of a king and the daughters of the Duke de Ligny It is well to
unite other luxuries of life with the luxury of the hospitable heart

The maxim is assuredly generous said the princess becoming more and
more agitated it is only a pity that you do not possess the mines of
El Dorado to make it practicable

It was on the subject of a mine said to be a rich one that I also
wished to speak to your highness Could I find a better opportunity
Though my fortune is already considerable it is nothing to what may
come to our family at any moment You will perhaps excuse therefore
what you are pleased to call my royal prodigalities

DAigrignys dilemma became momentarily more and more thorny The affair
of the medals was so important that he had concealed it even from
Dr Baleinier though he had called in his services to forward immense
interests Neither had Tripeaud been informed of it for the princess
believed that she had destroyed every vestige of those papers of
Adriennes father which might have put him on the scent of this
discovery The abbe therefore was not only greatly alarmed that Mdlle
de Cardoville might be informed of this secret but he trembled lest she
should divulge it

The princess sharing the alarms of DAigrigny interrupted her niece by
exclaiming Madame there are certain family affairs which ought to be
kept secret and without exactly understanding to what you allude I
must request you to change the subject

What madame are we not here a family party Is that not sufficiently
evident by the somewhat ungracious things that have been here said

No matter madame when affairs of interest are concerned which
are more or less disputable it is perfectly useless to speak of them
without the documents laid before every one

And of what have we been speaking this hour madame if not of
affairs of interest I really do not understand your surprise and
embarrassment

I am neither surprised nor embarrassed madame but for the last two
hours you have obliged me to listen to so many new and extravagant
things that a little amaze is very permissible

I beg your highnesss pardon but you are very much embarrassed said
Adrienne looking fixedly at her aunt and M dAigrigny alsowhich
confirms certain suspicions that I have not had the time to clear up
Have I then guessed rightly she added after a pause We will see

Madame I command you to be silent cried the princess no longer
mistress of herself

Oh madame said Adrienne for a person who has in general so much
command of her feelings you compromise yourself strangely

Providence as some will have it came to the aid of the princess and
the Abbe dAigrigny at this critical juncture A valet entered the
room his countenance bore such marks of fright and agitation that the
princess exclaimed as soon as she saw him Why Dubois what is the
matter

I have to beg pardon your highness for interrupting you against
your express orders but a police inspector demands to speak with you
instantly He is below stairs and the yard is full of policemen and
soldiers

Notwithstanding the profound surprise which this new incident occasioned
her the princess determining to profit by the opportunity thus
afforded to concert prompt measures with DAigrigny on the subject of
Adriennes threatened revelations rose and said to the abbe Will you
be so obliging as to accompany me M dAigrigny for I do not know what
the presence of this commissary of police may signify

DAigrigny followed the speaker into the next room




CHAPTER XLI TREACHERY

The Princess de SaintDizier accompanied by DAigrigny and followed
by the servants stopped short in the next room to that in which had
remained Adrienne Tripeaud and the doctor

Where is the commissary asked the princess of the servant who had
just before announced to her the arrival of that magistrate

In the blue saloon madame

My compliments and beg him to wait for me a few moments

The man bowed and withdrew As soon as he was gone Madame de Saint
Dizier approached hastily M dAigrigny whose countenance usually firm
and haughty was now pale and agitated

You see cried the princess in a hurried voice Adrienne knows all
What shall we dowhat

I cannot tell said the abbe with a fixed and absent look This
disclosure is a terrible blow to us

Is all then lost

There is only one means of safety said M dAigrignythe doctor

But how cried the princess So sudden this very day

Two hours hence it will be too late ere then this infernal girl will
have seen Marshal Simons daughters

ButFrederickit is impossible M Baleinier will never consent I
ought to have been prepared before hand as we intended after todays
examination

No matter replied the abbe quickly the doctor must try at any
hazard

But under what pretext

I will try and find one

Suppose you were to find a pretext Frederick and we could act
immediatelynothing would be ready down there

Be satisfied they are always ready there by habitual foresight

How instruct the doctor on the instant resumed the princess

To send for him would be to rouse the suspicions of your niece said
M dAigrigny thoughtfully and we must avoid that before everything

Of course answered the princess her confidence in the doctor is one
of our greatest resources

There is a way said the abbe quickly I will write a few words in
haste to Baleinier one of your people can take the note to him as if
it came from withoutfrom a patient dangerously ill

An excellent idea cried the princess You are right Hereupon this
tablethere is everything necessary for writing Quick quickBut will
the doctor succeed

In truth I scarcely dare to hope it said the marquis sitting down
at the table with repressed rage Thanks to this examination going
beyond our hopes which our man hidden behind the curtain has
faithfully taken down in shorthandthanks to the violent scenes which
would necessarily have occurred tomorrow and the day afterthe doctor
by fencing himself round with all sorts of clever precautions would
have been able to act with the most complete certainty But to ask this
of him today on the instantHerminiait is folly to think ofThe
marquis threw down the pen which he held in his hand then he added
in a tone of bitter and profound irritation At the very moment of
successto see all our hopes destroyedOh the consequences of all
this are incalculable Your niece will be the cause of the greatest
mischiefoh the greatest injury to us

It is impossible to describe the expression of deep rage and implacable
hatred with which DAigrigny uttered these last words

Frederick cried the princess with anxiety as she clasped her hands
strongly around the abbes I conjure you do not despairThe doctor
is fertile in resources and he is so devoted to us Let us at least
make the attempt

Wellit is at least a chance said the abbe taking up the pen again

Should it come to the worst said the princess and Adrienne go this
evening to fetch General Simons daughters she may perhaps no longer
find them

We cannot hope for that It is impossible that Rodins orders should
have been so quickly executed We should have been informed of it

It is true Write then to the doctor I will send you Dubois to carry
your letter Courage Frederick we shall yet be too much for that
ungovernable girl Madame de SaintDizier added with concentrated
rage Oh Adrienne Adrienne you shall pay dearly for your insolent
sarcasms and the anxiety you have caused us

As she went out the princess turned towards M dAigrigny and said to
him Wait for me here I will tell you the meaning of this visit of the
police and we will go in together

The princess disappeared DAigrigny dashed off a few words with a
trembling hand




CHAPTER XLII THE SNARE

After the departure of Madame de SaintDizier and the marquis Adrienne
had remained in her aunts apartment with M Baleinier and Baron
Tripeaud

On hearing of the commissarys arrival Mdlle de Cardoville had felt
considerable uneasiness for there could be no doubt that as Agricola
had apprehended this magistrate was come to search the hotel and
extension in order to find the smith whom he believed to be concealed
there

Though she looked upon Agricolas hidingplace as a very safe one
Adrienne was not quite tranquil on his account so in the event of any
unfortunate accident she thought it a good opportunity to recommend the
refugee to the doctor an intimate friend as we have said of one
of the most influential ministers of the day So drawing near to the
physician who was conversing in a low voice with the baron she said
to him in her softest and most coaxing manner My good M Baleinier I
wish to speak a few words with you She pointed to the deep recess of
one of the windows

I am at your orders madame answered the doctor as he rose to follow
Adrienne to the recess

M Tripeaud who no longer sustained by the abbes presence dreaded
the young lady as he did fire was not sorry for this diversion To keep
up appearances he stationed himself before one of the sacred pictures
and began again to contemplate it as if there were no bounds to his
admiration

When Mdlle de Cardoville was far enough from the baron not to be
overheard by him she said to the physician who all smiles and
benevolence waited for her to explain My good doctor you are
my friend as you were my fathers Just now notwithstanding the
difficulty of your position you had the courage to show yourself my
only partisan

Not at all madame do not go and say such things cried the doctor
affecting a pleasant kind of anger Plague ont you would get me
into a pretty scrape so pray be silent on that subject Vade retro
Satanaswhich means Get thee behind me charming little demon that
you are

Do not be afraid answered Adrienne with a smile I will not
compromise you Only allow me to remind you that you have often made me
offers of service and spoken to me of your devotion

Put me to the testand you will see if I do not keep my promises

Well then give me a proof on the instant said Adrienne quickly

Capital this is how I like to be taken at my word What can I do for
you

Are you still very intimate with your friend the minister

Yes I am just treating him for a loss of voice which he always has
the day they put questions to him in the house He likes it better

I want you to obtain from him something very important for me

For you pray what is it

At this instant the valet entered the room delivered a letter to M
Baleinier and said to him A footman has just brought this letter for
you sir it is very pressing

The physician took the letter and the servant went out

This is one of the inconveniences of merit said Adrienne smiling
they do not leave you a moments rest my poor doctor

Do not speak of it madame said the physician who could not conceal
a start of amazement as he recognized the writing of DAigrigny these
patients think we are made of iron and have monopolized the health
which they so much need They have really no mercy With your
permission madame added M Baleinier looking at Adrienne before he
unsealed the letter

Mdlle de Cardoville answered by a graceful nod Marquis dAigrignys
letter was not long the doctor read it at a single glance and
notwithstanding his habitual prudence he shrugged his shoulders and
said hastily Today why its impossible He is mad

You speak no doubt of some poor patient who has placed all his hopes
in youwho waits and calls for you at this moment Come my dear M
Baleinier do not reject his prayer It is so sweet to justify the
confidence we inspire

There was at once so much analogy and such contradiction between the
object of this letter written just before by Adriennes most implacable
enemy and these words of commiseration which she spoke in a touching
voice that Dr Baleinier himself could not help being struck with it
He looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with an almost embarrassed air as he
replied I am indeed speaking of one of my patients who counts much
upon mea great deal too muchfor he asks me to do an impossibility
But why do you feel so interested in an unknown person

If he is unfortunate I know enough to interest me The person for whom
I ask your assistance with the minister was quite as little known to
me and now I take the deepest interest in him I must tell you that he
is the son of the worthy soldier who brought Marshal Simons daughters
from the heart of Siberia

What he is

An honest workman the support of his family but I must tell you all
about itthis is how the affair took place

The confidential communication which Adrienne was going to make to
the doctor was cut short by Madame SaintDizier who followed by M
dAigrigny opened abruptly the door An expression of infernal joy
hardly concealed beneath a semblance of extreme indignation was visible
in her countenance

M dAigrigny threw rapidly as he entered the apartment an inquiring
and anxious glance at M Baleinier The doctor answered by a shake of
the head The abbe bit his lips with silent rage he had built his last
hopes upon the doctor and his projects seemed now forever annihilated
notwithstanding the new blow which the princess had in reserve for
Adrienne

Gentlemen said Madame de SaintDizier in a sharp hurried voice for
she was nearly choking with wicked pleasure gentlemen pray be seated
I have some new and curious things to tell you on the subject of this
young lady She pointed to her niece with a look of ineffable hatred
and disdain

My poor child what is the matter now said M Baleinier in a soft
wheedling tone before he left the window where he was standing with
Adrienne Whatever happens count upon meAnd the physician went to
seat himself between M dAigrigny and M Tripeaud

At her aunts insolent address Mdlle de Cardoville had proudly lined
her head The blood rushed to her face and irritated at the new attacks
with which she was menaced she advanced to the table where the princess
was seated and said in an agitated voice to M Baleinier I shall
expect you to call on me as soon as possible my dear doctor You know
that I wish particularly to speak with you

Adrienne made one step towards the armchair on which she had left her
hat The princess rose abruptly and exclaimed What are you doing
madame

I am about to retire Your highness has expressed to me your will and
I have told you mine It is enough

She took her hat Madame de SaintDizier seeing her prey about to
escape hastened towards her niece and in defiance of all propriety
seized her violently by the arm with a convulsive grasp and bade her
Remain

Fie madame exclaimed Adrienne with an accent of painful contempt
have we sunk so low

You wish to escapeyou are afraid resumed Madame de SaintDizier
looking at her disdainfully from head to foot

With these words you are afraid you could have made Adrienne de
Cardoville walk into a fiery furnace Disengaging her arm from her
aunts grasp with a gesture full of nobleness and pride she threw down
the hat upon the chair and returning to the table said imperiously to
the princess There is something even stronger than the disgust with
which all this inspires methe fear of being accused of cowardice Go
on madame I am listening

With her head raised her color somewhat heightened her glance half
veiled by a tear of indignation her arms folded over her bosom which
heaved in spite of herself with deep emotion and her little foot
beating convulsively on the carpet Adrienne looked steadily at her
aunt The princess wished to infuse drop by drop the poison with
which she was swelling and make her victim suffer as long as possible
feeling certain that she could not escape Gentlemen said Madame de
SaintDizier in a forced voice this has occurred I was told that
the commissary of police wished to speak with me I went to receive this
magistrate he excused himself with a troubled air for the nature of
the duty he had to perform A man against whom a warrant was out had
been seen to enter the gardenhouse

Adrienne started there could be no doubt that Agricola was meant But
she recovered her tranquillity when she thought of the security of the
hidingplace she had given him

The magistrate continued the princess asked my consent to search
the hotel and extension to discover this man It was his right I
begged him to commence with the gardenhouse and accompanied him
Notwithstanding the improper conduct of Mademoiselle it never I
confess entered my head for a moment that she was in any way mixed up
with this police business I was deceived

What do you mean madame cried Adrienne

You shall know all madame said the princess with a triumphant air
in good time You were in rather too great a hurry just now to show
yourself so proud and satirical Well I accompanied the commissary
in his search we came to the summerhouse I leave you to imagine the
stupor and astonishment of the magistrate on seeing three creatures
dressed up like actresses At my request the fact was noted in the
official report for it is well to reveal such extravagances to all whom
it may concern

The princess acted very wisely said Tripeaud bowing it is well
that the authorities should be informed of such matters

Adrienne too much interested in the fate of the workman to think of
answering Tripeaud or the princess listened in silence and strove to
conceal her uneasiness

The magistrate resumed Madame de SaintDizier began by a severe
examination of these young girls to learn if any man had with their
knowledge been introduced into the house with incredible effrontery
they answered that they had seen nobody enter

The truehearted honest girls thought Mademoiselle de Cardoville
full of joy the poor workman is safe the protection of Dr Baleinier
will do the rest

Fortunately continued the princess one of my women Mrs Grivois
had accompanied me This excellent person remembering to have seen
Mademoiselle return home at eight oclock in the morning remarked with
much simplicity to the magistrate that the man whom they sought
might probably have entered by the little garden gate left open
accidentally by Mademoiselle

It would have been well madame said Tripeaud to have caused to be
noted also in the report that Mademoiselle had returned home at eight
oclock in the morning

I do not see the necessity for this said the doctor faithful to his
part it would have been quite foreign to the search carried on by the
commissary

But doctor said Tripeaud

But baron resumed M Baleinier in a firm voice that is my
opinion

It was not mine doctor said the princess like M Tripeaud I
considered it important to establish the fact by an entry in the report
and I saw by the confused and troubled countenance of the magistrate
how painful it was to register the scandalous conduct of a young person
placed in so high a position in society

Certainly madame said Adrienne losing patience I believe your
modesty to be about equal to that of this candid commissary of police
but it seems to me that your mutual innocence was alarmed a little too
soon You might and ought to have reflected that there was nothing
extraordinary in my coming home at eight oclock if I had gone out at
six

The excuse though somewhat tardy is at least cunning said the
princess spitefully

I do not excuse myself madame said Adrienne but as M Baleinier
has been kind enough to speak a word in my favor I give the possible
interpretation of a fact which it would not become me to explain in
your presence

The fact will stand however in the report said Tripeaud until the
explanation is given

Abbe dAigrigny his forehead resting on his hand remained as if a
stranger to this scene he was too much occupied with his fears at the
consequences of the approaching interview between Mdlle de Cardoville
and Marshal Simons daughtersfor there seemed no possibility of using
force to prevent Adrienne from going out that evening

Madame de SaintDizier went on The fact which so greatly scandalized
the commissary is nothing compared to what I yet have to tell you
gentlemen We had searched all parts of the pavilion without finding any
one and were just about to quit the bedchamber for we had taken
this room the last when Mrs Grivois pointed out to us that one of the
golden mouldings of a panel did not appear to come quite home to the
wall We drew the attention of the magistrate to this circumstance his
men examined touched feltthe panel flew openand thencan you
guess what we discovered But no it is too odious too revolting I
dare not even

Then I dare madame said Adrienne resolutely though she saw with
the utmost grief the retreat of Agricola was discovered I will spare
your highnesss candor the recital of this new scandal and yet what I
am about to say is in nowise intended as a justification

It requires one however said Madame de SaintDizier with a
disdainful smile a man concealed by you in your own bedroom

A man concealed in her bedroom cried the Marquis dAigrigny raising
his head with apparent indignation which only covered a cruel joy

A man in the bedroom of Mademoiselle added Baron Tripeaud I hope
this also was inserted in the report

Yes yes baron said the princess with a triumphant air

But this man said the doctor in a hypocritical tone must have
been a robber Any other supposition would be in the highest degree
improbable This explains itself

Your indulgence deceives you M Baleinier answered the princess
dryly

We knew the sort of thieves said Tripeaud they are generally young
men handsome and very rich

You are wrong sir resumed Madame de SaintDizier Mademoiselle does
not raise her views so high She proves that a dereliction from duty
may be ignoble as well as criminal I am no longer astonished at the
sympathy which was just now professed for the lower orders It is the
more touching and affecting as the man concealed by her was dressed in
a blouse

A blouse cried the baron with an air of extreme disgust then he is
one of the common people It really makes ones hair stand on end

The man is a working smithhe confessed it said the princess but
not to be unjusthe is really a goodlooking fellow It was doubtless
that singular worship which Mademoiselle pays to the beautiful

Enough madame enough said Adrienne suddenly for hitherto
disdaining to answer she had listened to her aunt with growing and
painful indignation I was just now on the point of defending myself
against one of your odious insinuationsbut I will not a second time
descend to any such weakness One word only madame has this honest and
worthy artisan been arrested

To be sure he has been arrested and taken to prison under a strong
escort Does not that pierce your heart sneered the princess with a
triumphant air Your tender pity for this interesting smith must indeed
be very great since it deprives you of your sarcastic assurance

Yes madame for I have something better to do than to satirize that
which is utterly odious and ridiculous replied Adrienne whose eyes
grew dim with tears at the thought of the cruel hurt to Agricolas
family Then putting her hat on and tying the strings she said to the
doctor M Baleinier I asked you just now for your interest with the
minister

Yes madame and it will give me great pleasure to act on your behalf

Is your carriage below

Yes madame said the doctor much surprised

You will be good enough to accompany me immediately to the ministers
Introduced by you he will not refuse me the favor or rather the act of
justice that I have to solicit

What mademoiselle said the princess do you dare take such a
course without my orders after what has just passed It is really
quite unheardof

It confounds one added Tripeaud but we must not be surprised at
anything

The moment Adrienne asked the doctor if his carriage was below
DAigrigny started A look of intense satisfaction flashed across his
countenance and he could hardly repress the violence of his delight
when darting a rapid and significant glance at the doctor he saw
the latter respond to it by trace closing his eyelids in token of
comprehension and assent

When therefore the princess resumed in an angry tone
addressing herself to Adrienne Madame I forbid you leaving the
houseDAigrigny said to the speaker with a peculiar inflection
of the voice I think your highness we may trust the lady to the
doctors care

The marquis pronounced these words in so significant a manner that
the princess having looked by turns at the physician and DAigrigny
understood it all and her countenance grew radiant with joy

Not only did this pass with extreme rapidity but the night was already
almost come so that Adrienne absorbed in painful thoughts with regard
to Agricola did not perceive the different signals exchanged between
the princess the doctor and the abbe Even had she done so they would
have been incomprehensible to her

Not wishing to have the appearance of yielding too readily to the
suggestion of the marquis Madame de SaintDizier resumed Though the
doctor seems to me to be far too indulgent to mademoiselle I might not
see any great objection to trusting her with him but that I do not wish
to establish such a precedent for hence forward she must have no will
but mine

Madame said the physician gravely feigning to be somewhat shocked by
the words of the Princess de SaintDizier I do not think I have been
too indulgent to mademoisellebut only just I am at her orders
to take her to the minister if she wishes it I do not know what
she intends to solicit but I believe her incapable of abusing the
confidence I repose in her or making me support a recommendation
undeserved

Adrienne much moved extended her hand cordially to the doctor and
said to him Rest assured my excellent friend that you will thank me
for the step I am taking for you will assist in a noble action

Tripeaud who was not in the secret of the new plans of the doctor and
the abbe in a low voice faltered to the latter with a stupefied air
What will you let her go

Yes yes answered DAigrigny abruptly making a sign that he should
listen to the princess who was about to speak Advancing towards her
niece she said to her in a slow and measured tone laying a peculiar
emphasis on every word One moment more mademoiselleone last word
in presence of these gentlemen Answer me Notwithstanding the heavy
charges impending over you are you still determined to resist my formal
commands

Yes madame

Notwithstanding the scandalous exposure which has just taken place you
still persist in withdrawing yourself from my authority

Yes madame

You refuse positively to submit to the regular and decent mode of life
which I would impose upon you

I have already told you madame that I am about to quit this dwelling
in order to live alone and after my own fashion

Is that your final decision

It is my last word

Reflect the matter is serious Beware

I have given your highness my last word and I never speak it twice

Gentlemen you hear all this resumed the princess I have tried in
vain all that was possible to conciliate Mademoiselle will have only
herself to thank for the measures to which this audacious revolt will
oblige me to have recourse

Be it so madame replied Adrienne Then addressing M Baleinier she
said quickly to him Come my dear doctor I am dying with impatience
Let us set out immediately Every minute lost may occasion bitter tears
to an honest family

So saying Adrienne left the room precipitately with the physician
One of the servants called for M Baleiniers carriage Assisted by
the doctor Adrienne mounted the step without perceiving that he said
something in a low whisper to the footman that opened the coachdoor

When however he was seated by the side of Mdlle de Cardoville and
the door was closed upon them he waited for about a second and
then called out in a loud voice to the coachman To the house of the
minister by the private entrance The horses started at a gallop




CHAPTER XLIII A FALSE FRIEND

Night had set in dark and cold The sky which had been clear till the
sun went down was now covered with gray and lurid clouds a strong wind
raised here and there in circling eddies the snow that was beginning
to fall thick and fast

The lamps threw a dubious light into the interior of Dr Baleiniers
carriage in which he was seated alone with Adrienne de Cardoville
The charming countenance of the latter faintly illumined by the lamps
beneath the shade of her little gray hat looked doubly white and pure
in contrast with the dark lining of the carriage which was now filled
with that sweet delicious and almost voluptuous perfume which hangs
about the garments of young women of taste The attitude of the girl
seated next to the doctor was full of grace Her slight and elegant
figure imprisoned in her highnecked dress of blue cloth imprinted its
wavy outline on the soft cushion against which she leaned her little
feet crossed one upon the other and stretched rather forward rested
upon a thick bearskin which carpeted the bottom of the carriage
In her hand which was ungloved and dazzlingly white she held a
magnificently embroidered handkerchief with which to the great
astonishment of M Baleinier she dried her eyes now filled with tears

Yes Adrienne wept for she now felt the reaction from the painful
scenes through which she had passed at SaintDizier House to the
feverish and nervous excitement which had till then sustained her had
succeeded a sorrowful dejection Resolute in her independence proud
in her disdain implacable in her irony audacious in her resistance
to unjust oppression Adrienne was yet endowed with the most acute
sensibility which she always dissembled however in the presence of
her aunt and those who surrounded her

Notwithstanding her courage no one could have been less masculine less
of a virago than Mdlle Cardoville She was essentially womanly but as
a woman she knew how to exercise great empire over herself the moment
that the least mark of weakness on her part would have rejoiced or
emboldened her enemies

The carriage had rolled onwards for some minutes but Adrienne drying
her tears in silence to the doctors great astonishment had not yet
uttered a word

What my dear Mdlle Adrienne said M Baleinier truly surprised at
her emotion what you that were just now so courageous weeping

Yes answered Adrienne in an agitated voice I weep in presence of a
friend but before my auntoh never

And yet in that long interview your stinging replies

Ah me do you think that I resigned myself with pleasure to that war
of sarcasm Nothing is more painful to me than such combats of bitter
irony to which I am forced by the necessity of defending myself
from this woman and her friends You speak of my courage it does not
consist I assure you in the display of wicked feelingsbut in the
power to repress and hide all that I suffer when I hear myself
treated so grosslyin the presence too of people that I hate and
despisewhen after all I have never done them any harm and have only
asked to be allowed to live alone freely and quietly and see those
about me happy

Thats where it is they envy your happiness and that which you bestow
upon others

And it is my aunt cried Adrienne with indignation my aunt whose
whole life has been one long scandal that accuses me in this revolting
manneras if she did not know me proud and honest enough never to
make a choice of which I should be ashamed Oh if I ever love I shall
proclaim it I shall be proud of it for love as I understand it is
the most glorious feeling in the world But alas continued Adrienne
with redoubled bitterness of what use are truth and honor if they do
not secure you from suspicions which are as absurd as they are odious
So saying she again pressed her handkerchief to her eyes

Come my dear Mdlle Adrienne said M Baleinier in a voice full
of the softest unction becalmit is all over now You have in me a
devoted friend As he pronounced these last words he blushed in spite
of his diabolical craft

I know you are my friend said Adrienne I shall never forget that
by taking my part today you exposed yourself to the resentment of my
auntfor I am not ignorant of her power which is very great alas for
evil

As for that said the doctor affecting a profound indifference we
medical men are pretty safe from personal enmities

Nay my dear M Baleinier Mme de SaintDizier and her friends
never forgive said the young girl with a shudder It needed all my
invincible aversion my innate horror for all that is base cowardly
and perfidious to induce me to break so openly with her But if death
itself were the penalty I could not hesitate and yet she added with
one of those graceful smiles which gave such a charm to her beautiful
countenance yet I am fond of life if I have to reproach myself
with anything it is that I would have it too bright too fair too
harmonious but then you know I am resigned to my faults

Well come I am more tranquil said the doctor gayly for you
smilethat is a good sign

It is often the wisest course and yet ought I smile after the
threats that my aunt has held out to me Still what can she do what is
the meaning of this kind of family council Did she seriously think that
the advice of a M DAigrigny or a M Tripeaud could have influenced me
And then she talked of rigorous measures What measures can she take do
you know

I think between ourselves that the princess only wished to frighten
you and hopes to succeed by persuasion She has the misfortune to fancy
herself a mother of the Church and dreams of your conversion said the
doctor maliciously for he now wished to tranquillize Adrienne at any
cost but let us think no more about it Your fire eyes must shine with
all their lustre to fascinate the minister that we are going to see

You are right dear doctor we ought always avoid grief for it has the
disadvantage of making us forget the sorrows of others But here am
I availing myself of your kindness without even telling you what I
require

Luckily we shall have plenty of time to talk over it for our
statesman lives at some distance

In two words heres the mystery answered Adrienne I told you what
reasons I had to interest myself in that honest workman This morning he
came to me in great grief to inform me that he was compromised by some
songs he had written for he is a poet and that though innocent
he was threatened with an arrest and if they put him into prison his
family whose sole support he is would die of hunger Therefore he came
to beg me to procure bail for him so that he might be left at liberty
to work I promised immediately thinking of your interest with the
minister for as they were already in pursuit of the poor lad I chose
to conceal him in my residence and you know how my aunt has twisted
that action Now tell me do you think that by means of your
recommendation the minister will grant me the freedom of this workman
bail being given for the same

No doubt of it There will not be the shadow of a
difficultyespecially when you have explained the facts to him with
that eloquence of the heart which you possess in perfection

Do you know my dear Dr Baleinier why I have taken the resolution
which is perhaps a strange one to ask you to accompany me to the
ministers

Why doubtless to recommend your friend in a more effective manner

Yesbut also to put an end by a decisive step to the calumnies which
my aunt will be sure to spread with regard to me and which she has
already you know had inserted in the report of the commissary of
police I have preferred to address myself at once frankly and openly
to a man placed in a high social position I will explain all to him
who will believe me because truth has an accent of its own

All this my dear Mdlle Adrienne is wisely planned You will as the
saw says kill two birds with one stoneor rather you will obtain by
one act of kindness two acts of justice you will destroy a dangerous
calumny and restore a worthy youth to liberty

Come said Adrienne laughing thanks to this pleasing prospect my
light heart has returned

How true that in life said the doctor philosophically everything
depends on the point of view

Adrienne was so completely ignorant of the forms of a constitutional
government and had so blind a confidence in the doctor that she did
not doubt for an instant what he told her She therefore resumed with
joy What happiness it will be when I go to fetch the daughters of
Marshal Simon to be able to console this workmans mother who is now
perhaps in a state of cruel anxiety at not seeing her son return home

Yes you will have this pleasure said M Baleinier with a smile
for we will solicit and intrigue to such purpose that the good mother
may learn from you the release of her son before she even knows that he
has been arrested

How kind how obliging you are said Adrienne Really if the motive
were not so serious I should be ashamed of making you lose so much
precious time my dear M Baleinier But I know your heart

I have no other wish than to prove to you my profound devotion my
sincere attachment said the doctor inhaling a pinch of snuff But
at the same time he cast an uneasy glance through the window for the
carriage was just crossing the Place de lOdeon and in spite of
the snow he could see the front of the Odeon theatre brilliantly
illuminated Now Adrienne who had just turned her head towards that
side might perhaps be astonished at the singular road they were taking

In order to draw off her attention by a skillful diversion the doctor
exclaimed suddenly Bless me I had almost forgotten

What is the matter M Baleinier said Adrienne turning hastily
towards him

I had forgotten a thing of the highest importance in regard to the
success of our petition

What is it please asked the young girl anxiously

M Baleinier gave a cunning smile Every man said he has his
weaknessministers even more than others The one we are going to visit
has the folly to attach the utmost importance to his title and the
first impression would be unfavorable if you did not lay great stress
on the Minister

Is that all my dear M Baleinier said Adrienne smiling in her turn
I will even go so far as Your Excellency which is I believe one of
his adopted titles

Not nowbut that is no matter if you could even slide in a My Lord or
two our business would be done at once

Be satisfied since there are upstart ministers as well as Cityturned
gentlemen I will remember Molieres M Jourdain and feed full the
gluttonous vanity of your friend

I give him up to you for I know he will be in good hands replied the
physician who rejoiced to see that the carriage had now entered those
dark streets which lead from the Place de lOdeon to the Pantheon
district I do not wish to find fault with the minister for being
proud since his pride may be of service to us on this occasion

These petty devices are innocent enough said Mdlle de Cardoville
and I confess that I do not scruple to have recourse to them Then
leaning towards the doorsash she added Gracious how sad and dark
are these streets What wind what snow In which quarter are we

What are you so ungrateful that you do not recognize by the absence
of shops your dear quarter of the Faubourg Saint Germain

I imagine we had quitted it long ago

I thought so too said the physician leaning forward as if to
ascertain where they were but we are still there My poor coachman
blinded by the snow which is beating against his face must have gone
wrong just nowbut we are all right again Yes I perceive we are in
the Rue Saint Guillaumenot the gayest of streets by the waybut in
ten minutes we shall arrive at the ministers private entrance for
intimate friends like myself enjoy the privilege of escaping the honors
of a grand reception

Mdlle de Cardoville like most carriagepeople was so little
acquainted with certain streets of Paris as well as with the customs
of men in office that she did not doubt for a moment the statements of
Baleinier in whom she reposed the utmost confidence

When they left the SaintDizier House the doctor had upon his lips a
question which he hesitated to put for fear of endangering himself in
the eyes of Adrienne The latter had spoken of important interests the
existence of which had been concealed from her The doctor who was
an acute and skillful observer had quite clearly remarked the
embarrassment and anxiety of the princess and DAigrigny He no longer
doubted that the plot directed against Adrienneone in which he was
the blind agent in submission to the will of the Orderrelated to
interests which had been concealed from him and which for that very
reason he burned to discover for every member of the dark conspiracy
to which he belonged had necessarily acquired the odious vices inherent
to spies and informersenvy suspicion and jealous curiosity

It is easy to understand therefore that Dr Baleinier though quite
determined to serve the projects of DAigrigny was yet very anxious
to learn what had been kept from him Conquering his irresolution and
finding the opportunity favorable and no time to be lost he said to
Adrienne after a moments silence I am going perhaps to ask you a
very indiscreet question If you think it such pray do not answer

Naygo on I entreat you

Just nowa few minutes before the arrival of the commissary of police
was announced to your auntyou spoke I think of some great interests
which had hitherto been concealed from you

Yes I did so

These words continued M Baleinier speaking slowly and emphatically
appeared to make a deep impression on the princess

An impression so deep said Adrienne that sundry suspicions of mine
were changed to certainty

I need not tell you my charming friend resumed M Baleinier in a
bland tone that if I remind you of this circumstance it is only to
offer you my services in case they should be required If notand
there is the shadow of impropriety in letting me know moreforget that
I have said a word

Adrienne became serious and pensive and after a silence of some
moments she thus answered Dr Baleinier On this subject there are
some things that I do not knowothers that I may tell youothers again
that I must keep from you but you are so kind today that I am happy
to be able to give you a new mark of confidence

Then I wish to know nothing said the doctor with an air of humble
deprecation for I should have the appearance of accepting a kind of
reward whilst I am paid a thousand times over by the pleasure I feel
in serving you

Listen said Adrienne without attending to the delicate scruples of
Dr Baleinier I have powerful reasons for believing that an immense
inheritance must at no very distant period be divided between
the members of my family all of whom I do not knowfor after the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes those from whom we are descended
were dispersed in foreign countries and experienced a great variety of
fortunes

Really cried the doctor becoming extremely interested Where is
this inheritance in whose hands

I do not know

Now how will you assert your rights

That I shall learn soon

Who will inform you of it

That I may not tell you

But how did you find out the existence of this inheritance

That also I may not tell you returned Adrienne in a soft and
melancholy tone which remarkably contrasted with the habitual vivacity
of her conversation It is a secreta strange secretand in those
moments of excitement in which you have sometimes surprised me I have
been thinking of extraordinary circumstances connected with this secret
which awakened within me lofty and magnificent ideas

Adrienne paused and was silent absorbed in her own reflections
Baleinier did not seek to disturb her In the first place Mdlle
de Cardoville did not perceive the direction the coach was taking
secondly the doctor was not sorry to ponder over what he had just
heard With his usual perspicuity he saw that the Abbe dAigrigny
was concerned in this inheritance and he resolved instantly to make a
secret report on the subject either M dAigrigny was acting under the
instructions of the Order or by his own impulse in the one event the
report of the doctor would confirm a fact in the other it would reveal
one

For some time therefore the lady and Dr Baleinier remained perfectly
silent no longer even disturbed by the noise of the wheels for the
carriage now rolled over a thick carpet of snow and the streets had
become more and more deserted Notwithstanding his crafty treachery
notwithstanding his audacity and the blindness of his dupe the doctor
was not quite tranquil as to the result of his machinations The
critical moment approached and the least suspicion roused in the
mind of Adrienne by any inadvertence on his part might ruin all his
projects

Adrienne already fatigued by the painful emotions of the day shuddered
from time to time as the cold became more and more piercing in her
haste to accompany Dr Baleinier she had neglected to take either shawl
or mantle

For some minutes the coach had followed the line of a very high wall
which seen through the snow looked white against a black sky The
silence was deep and mournful Suddenly the carriage stopped and
the footman went to knock at a large gateway he first gave two rapid
knocks and then one other at a long interval Adrienne did not notice
the circumstance for the noise was not loud and the doctor had
immediately begun to speak to drown with his voice this species of
signal

Here we are at last said he gayly to Adrienne you must be very
winningthat is you must be yourself

Be sure I will do my best replied Adrienne with a smile then she
added shivering in spite of herself How dreadfully cold it is I must
confess my dear Dr Baleinier that when I have been to fetch my poor
little relations from the house of our workmans mother I shall be
truly glad to find myself once more in the warmth and light of my own
cheerful rooms for you know my aversion to cold and darkness

It is quite natural said the doctor gallantly the most charming
flowers require the most light and heat

Whilst the doctor and Mdlle de Cardoville exchanged these few words
a heavy gate had turned creaking upon its hinges and the carriage had
entered a courtyard The physician got down first to offer his arm to
Adrienne




CHAPTER XLIV THE MINISTERS CABINET

The carriage had stopped before some steps covered with snow which led
to a vestibule lighted by a lamp The better to ascend the steps which
were somewhat slippery Adrienne leaned upon the doctors arm

Dear me how you tremble said he

Yes replied she shuddering I feel deadly cold In my haste I
came out without a shawl But how gloomy this house appears she added
pointing to the entrance

It is what you call the ministers private house the sanctum
sanctorum whither our statesman retires far from the sound of the
profane said Dr Baleinier with a smile Pray come in and he
pushed open the door of a large hall completely empty

They are right in saying resumed Dr Baleinier who covered his
secret agitation with an appearance of gayety that a ministers house
is like nobody elses Not a footmannot a page I should sayto be
found in the antechamber Luckily added he opening the door of a room
which communicated with the vestibule

In this seraglio reared I know the secret ways

Mdlle de Cardoville was now introduced into an apartment hung with
green embossed paper and very simply furnished with mahogany chairs
covered with yellow velvet the floor was carefully polished and
a globe lamp which gave at most a third of its proper light was
suspended at a much greater height than usual from the ceiling
Finding the appearance of this habitation singularly plain for the
dwelling of a minister Adrienne though she had no suspicion could not
suppress a movement of surprise and paused a moment on the threshold of
the door M Baleinier by whose arm she held guessed the cause of her
astonishment and said to her with a smile

This place appears to you very paltry for his excellency does it
not If you knew what a thing constitutional economy isMoreover
you will see a my lord who has almost as little pretension as his
furniture But please to wait for me an instant I will go and inform
the minister you are here and return immediately

Gently disengaging himself from the grasp of Adrienne who had
involuntarily pressed close to him the physician opened a small side
door by which he instantly disappeared Adrienne de Cardoville was left
alone

Though she could not have explained the cause of her impression there
was something aweinspiring to the young lady in this large cold
naked curtainless room and as by degrees she noticed certain
peculiarities in the furniture which she had not at first perceived
she was seized with an indefinable feeling of uneasiness

Approaching the cheerless hearth she perceived with surprise that an
iron grating completely enclosed the opening of the chimney and that
the tongs and shovel were fastened with iron chains Already astonished
by this singularity she was about mechanically to draw towards her
an armchair placed against the wall when she found that it remained
motionless She then discovered that the back of this piece of
furniture as well as that of all the other chairs was fastened to the
wainscoting by iron clamps Unable to repress a smile she exclaimed
Have they so little confidence in the statesman in whose house I am
that they are obliged to fasten the furniture to the walls

Adrienne had recourse to this somewhat forced pleasantry as a kind of
effort to resist the painful feeling of apprehension that was gradually
creeping over her for the most profound and mournful silence reigned in
this habitation where nothing indicated the life the movement and the
activity which usually surround a great centre of business Only
from time to time the young lady heard the violent gusts of wind from
without

More than a quarter of an hour had elapsed and M Baleinier did not
return In her impatient anxiety Adrienne wished to call some one to
inquire about the doctor and the minister She raised her eyes to look
for a bellrope by the side of the chimneyglass she found none but
she perceived that what she had hitherto taken for a glass thanks to
the half obscurity of the room was in reality a large sheet of
shining tin Drawing nearer to it she accidentally touched a bronzed
candlestick and this as well as a clock was fixed to the marble of
the chimneypiece

In certain dispositions of mind the most insignificant circumstances
often assume terrific proportions This immovable candlestick this
furniture fastened to the wainscot this glass replaced by a tin sheet
this profound silence and the prolonged absence of M Baleinier had
such an effect upon Adrienne that she was struck with a vague terror
Yet such was her implicit confidence in the doctor that she reproached
herself with her own fears persuading herself that the causes of them
were after all of no real importance and that it was unreasonable to
feel uneasy at such trifles

Still though she thus strove to regain courage her anxiety induced her
to do what otherwise she would never have attempted She approached the
little door by which the doctor had disappeared and applied her ear to
it She held her breath and listened but heard nothing

Suddenly a dull heavy sound like that of a falling body was audible
just above her head she thought she could even distinguish a stifled
moaning Raising her eyes hastily she saw some particles of the
plaster fall from the ceiling loosened no doubt by the shaking of the
floor above

No longer able to resist the feeling of terror Adrienne ran to the door
by which she had entered with the doctor in order to call some one To
her great surprise she found it was fastened on the outside Yet since
her arrival she had heard no sound of a key turning in the lock

More and more alarmed the young girl flew to the little door by which
the physician had disappeared and at which she had just been listening
This door also was fastened on the outside

Still wishing to struggle with the terror which was gaining invincibly
upon her Adrienne called to her aid all the firmness of her character
and tried to argue away her fears

I must have been deceived she said it was only a fall that I heard
The moaning had no existence except in my imagination There are a
thousand reasons for believing that it was not a person who fell down
But then these locked doors They perhaps do not know that I am
here they may have thought that there was nobody in this room

As she uttered these words Adrienne looked round with anxiety then
she added in a firm voice No weakness it is useless to try to blind
myself to my real situation On the contrary I must look it well in the
face It is evident that I am not here at a ministers house no end of
reasons prove it beyond a doubt M Baleinier has therefore deceived me
But for what end Why has he brought me hither Where am I

The last two questions appeared to Adrienne both equally insoluble It
only remained clear that she was the victim of M Baleiniers perfidy
But this certainly seemed so horrible to the young girls truthful
and generous soul that she still tried to combat the idea by the
recollection of the confiding friendship which she had always shown this
man She said to herself with bitterness See how weakness and fear
may lead one to unjust and odious suspicions Yes for until the
last extremity it is not justifiable to believe in so infernal a
deceptionand then only upon the clearest evidence I will call some
one it is the only way of completely satisfying these doubts Then
remembering that there was no bell she added No matter I will knock
and some one will doubtless answer With her little delicate hand
Adrienne struck the door several times

The dull heavy sound which came from the door showed that it was very
thick No answer was returned to the young girl She ran to the other
door There was the same appeal on her part the same profound silence
withoutonly interrupted from time to time by the howling of the wind

I am not more timid than other people said Adrienne shuddering
I do not know if it is the excessive cold but I tremble in spite of
myself I endeavor to guard against all weakness yet I think that any
one in my position would find all this very strange and frightful

At this instant loud cries or rather savage and dreadful howls burst
furiously from the room just above and soon after a sort of stamping
of feet like the noise of a violent struggle shook the ceiling of the
apartment Struck with consternation Adrienne uttered a loud cry of
terror became deadly pale stood for a moment motionless with affright
and then rushed to one of the windows and abruptly threw it open

A violent gust of wind mixed with melted snow beat against Adriennes
face swept roughly into the room and soon extinguished the flickering
and smoky light of the lamp Thus plunged in profound darkness with
her hands clinging to the bars that were placed across the window
Mdlle de Cardoville yielded at length to the full influence of her
fears so long restrained and was about to call aloud for help when an
unexpected apparition rendered her for some minutes absolutely mute with
terror

Another wing of the building opposite to that in which she was stood
at no great distance Through the midst of the black darkness which
filled the space between one large lighted window was distinctly
visible Through the curtainless panes Adrienne perceived a white
figure gaunt and ghastly dragging after it a sort of shroud and
passing and repassing continually before the window with an abrupt and
restless motion Her eyes fixed upon this window shining through the
darkness Adrienne remained as if fascinated by that fatal vision and
as the spectacle filled up the measure of her fears she called for help
with all her might without quitting the bars of the window to which
she clung After a few seconds whilst she was thus crying out two tall
women entered the room in silence unperceived by Mdlle de Cardoville
who was still clinging to the window

These women of about forty to fifty years of age robust and masculine
were negligently and shabbily dressed like chambermaids of the lower
sort over their clothes they wore large aprons of blue cotton cut
sloping from their necks and reaching down to their feet One of them
who held a lamp in her hand had a broad red shining face a large
pimpled nose small green eyes and tow hair which straggled rough and
shaggy from beneath her dirty white cap The other sallow withered
and bony wore a mourningcap over a parchment visage pitted with
the smallpox and rendered still more repulsive by the thick black
eyebrows and some long gray hairs that overshadowed the upper lip This
woman carried half unfolded in her hand a garment of strange form
made of thick gray stuff

They both entered silently by the little door at the moment when
Adrienne in the excess of her terror was grasping the bars of the
window and crying out Help help

Pointing out the young lady to each other one of them went to place the
lamp on the chimneypiece whilst the other she who wore the mourning
cap approached the window and laid her great bony hand upon Mdlle de
Cardovilles shoulder

Turning round Adrienne uttered a new cry of terror at the sight of this
grim figure Then the first moment of stupor over she began to feel
less afraid hideous as was this woman it was at least some one to
speak to she exclaimed therefore in an agitated voice Where is M
Baleinier

The two women looked at each other exchanged a leer of mutual
intelligence but did not answer

I ask you madame resumed Adrienne where is M Baleinier who
brought me hither I wish to see him instantly

He is gone said the big woman

Gone cried Adrienne gone without meGracious heaven what can
be the meaning of all this Then after a moments reflection she
resumed Please to fetch me a coach

The two women looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders I
entreat you madame continued Adrienne with forced calmness in her
voice to fetch me a coach since M Baleinier is gone without me I
wish to leave this place

Come come madame said the tall woman who was called Tomboy
without appearing to listen to what Adrienne asked it is time for you
to go to bed

To go to bed cried Mdlle Cardoville in alarm This is really
enough to drive one mad Then addressing the two women she added
What is this house where am I answer

You are in a house said Tomboy in a rough voice where you must not
make a row from the window as you did just now

And where you must not put out the lamp as you have done added the
other woman who was called Gervaise or else we shall have a crow to
pick with you

Adrienne unable to utter a word and trembling with fear looked in a
kind of stupor from one to the other of these horrible women her reason
strove in vain to comprehend what was passing around her Suddenly she
thought she had guessed it and exclaimed I see there is a mistake
here I do not understand how but there is a mistake You take me for
some one else Do you know who I am My name is Adrienne de Cardoville
You see therefore that I am at liberty to leave this house no one in
the world has the right to detain me I command you then to fetch me
a coach immediately If there are none in this quarter let me have some
one to accompany me home to the Rue de Babylone SaintDizier House I
will reward such a person liberally and you also

Well have you finished said Tomboy What is the use of telling us
all this rubbish

Take care resumed Adrienne who wished to try every means if you
detain me here by force it will be very serious You do not know to
what you expose yourselves

Will you come to bed yes or no said Gervaise in a tone of harsh
impatience

Listen to me madame resumed Adrienne precipitately let me out
this place and I will give each of you two thousand francs It is not
enough I will give you tentwentywhatever you ask I am richonly
let me out for heavens sake let me outI cannot remain hereI
am afraid As she said this the tone of the poor girls voice was
heartrending

Twenty thousand francsthats the usual figure aint it Tomboy

Let be Gervaise they all sing the same song

Well then since reasons prayers and menaces are all in vain said
Adrienne gathering energy from her desperate position I declare to
you that I will go out and that instantly We will see if you are bold
enough to employ force against me

So saying Adrienne advanced resolutely towards the door But at this
moment the wild hoarse cries which had preceded the noise of the
struggle that had so frightened her again resounded only this time
they were not accompanied by the movement of feet

Oh what screams said Adrienne stopping short and in her terror
drawing nigh to the two women Do you not hear those cries What then
is this house in which one hears such things And over there too
added she almost beside herself as she pointed to the other wing where
the lighted windows shone through the darkness and the white figure
continued to pass and repass before it over there do you see What is
it

Oh that un said Tomboy one of the folks who like you have not
behaved well

What do you say cried Mdlle de Cardoville clasping her hands in
terror Heavens what is this house What do they do to them

What will be done to you if you are naughty and refuse to come to
bed answered Gervaise

They put this on them said Tomboy showing the garment that she had
held under her arm they clap em into the straitwaistcoast

Oh cried Adrienne hiding her face in her hands with horror A
terrible discovery had flashed suddenly upon her She understood it all

Capping the violent emotions of the day the effect of this last blow
was dreadful The young girl felt her strength give way Her hands fell
powerless her face became fearfully pale all her limbs trembled and
sinking upon her knees and casting a terrified glance at the strait
waistcoat she was just able to falter in a feeble voice Oh nonot
thatfor pitys sake madame I will dowhatever you wish And her
strength quite failing she would have fallen upon the ground if the
two women had not run towards her and received her fainting into their
arms

A fainting fit said Tomboy thats not dangerous Let us carry her
to bed We can undress her and this will be all nothing

Carry her then said Gervaise I will take the lamp

The tall and robust Tomboy took up Mdlle de Cardoville as if she
had been a sleeping child carried her in her arms and followed her
companion into the chamber through which M Baleinier had made his exit

This chamber though perfectly clean was cold and bare A greenish
paper covered the walls and a low little iron bedstead the head of
which formed a kind of shelf stood in one corner a stove fixed in the
chimneyplace was surrounded by an iron grating which forbade a near
approach a table fastened to the wall a chair placed before this
table and also clamped to the floor a mahogany chest of drawers and
a rush bottomed armchair completed the scanty furniture The curtainless
window was furnished on the inside with an iron grating which served to
protect the panes from being broken

It was into this gloomy retreat which formed so painful a contrast with
the charming little summerhouse in the Rue de Babylone that Adrienne
was carried by Tomboy who with the assistance of Gervaise placed the
inanimate form on the bed The lamp was deposited on the shelf at the
head of the couch Whilst one of the nurses held her up the other
unfastened and took off the cloth dress of the young girl whose head
drooped languidly on her bosom Though in a swoon large tears trickled
slowly from her closed eyes whose long black lashes threw their shadows
on the transparent whiteness of her cheeks Over her neck and breast of
ivory flowed the golden waves of her magnificent hair which had come
down at the time of her fall When as they unlaced her satin corset
less soft less fresh less white than the virgin form beneath which
lay like a statue of alabaster in its covering of lace and lawn one of
the horrible hags felt the arms and shoulders of the young girl with
her large red horny and chapped hands Though she did not completely
recover the use of her senses she started involuntarily from the rude
and brutal touch

Hasnt she little feet said the nurse who kneeling down was
employed in drawing off Adriennes stockings I could hold them both
in the hollow of my hand In fact a small rosy foot smooth as a
childs here and there veined with azure was soon exposed to view as
was also a leg with pink knee and ankle of as pure and exquisite a form
as that of Diana Huntress

And what hair said Tomboy so long and softShe might almost walk
upon it Twould be a pity to cut it off to put ice upon her skull As
she spoke she gathered up Adriennes magnificent hair and twisted it
as well as she could behind her head Alas it was no longer the fair
light hand of Georgette Florine or Hebe that arranged the beauteous
locks of their mistress with so much love and pride

And as she again felt the rude touch of the nurses hand the young
girl was once more seized with the same nervous trembling only more
frequently and strongly than before And soon whether by a sort of
instinctive repulsion magnetically excited during her swoon or from
the effect of the cold night air Adrienne again started and slowly came
to herself

It is impossible to describe her alarm horror and chaste indignation
as thrusting aside with both her hands the numerous curls that covered
her face bathed in tears she saw herself halfnaked between these
filthy hags At first she uttered a cry of shame and terror then to
escape from the looks of the women by a movement rapid as thought she
drew down the lamp placed on the shelf at the head of her bed so that
it was extinguished and broken to pieces on the floor After which in
the midst of the darkness the unfortunate girl covering herself with
the bedclothes burst into passionate sobs

The nurses attributed Adriennes cry and violent actions to a fit of
furious madness Oh you begin again to break the lampsthats your
partickler fancy is it cried Tomboy angrily as she felt her way
in the dark Well I gave you fair warning You shall have the strait
waistcoat on this very night like the mad gal upstairs

Thats it said the other hold her fast Tommy while I go and fetch
a light Between us well soon master her

Make haste for in spite of her soft look she must be a regular fury
We shall have to sit up all night with her I suppose

Sad and painful contrast That morning Adrienne had risen free
smiling happy in the midst of all the wonders of luxury and art and
surrounded by the delicate attentions of the three charming girls whom
she had chosen to serve her In her generous and fantastic mood she
had prepared a magnificent and fairylike surprise for the young Indian
prince her relation she had also taken a noble resolution with regard
to the two orphans brought home by Dagobert in her interview with Mme
de SaintDizier she had shown herself by turns proud and sensitive
melancholy and gay ironical and serious loyal and courageous finally
she had come to this accursed house to plead in favor of an honest and
laborious artisan

And now in the evening delivered over by an atrocious piece of
treachery to the ignoble hands of two coarseminded muses in a
madhouseMdlle de Cardoville felt her delicate limbs imprisoned in
that abominable garment which is called a straitwaistcoat

Mdlle de Cardoville passed a horrible night in company with the two
hags The next morning at nine oclock what was the young ladys
stupor to see Dr Baleinier enter the room still smiling with an air at
once benevolent and paternal

Well my dear child said he in a bland affectionate voice how
have we spent the night




CHAPTER XLV THE VISIT

The keepers yielding to Mdlle de Cardovilles prayers and above all
to her promises of good behavior had only left on the canvas jacket a
portion of the time Towards morning they had allowed her to rise and
dress herself without interfering

Adrienne was seated on the edge of her bed The alteration in her
features her dreadful paleness the lurid fire of fever shining in
her eyes the convulsive trembling which ever and anon shook her
frame showed already the fatal effects of this terrible night upon a
susceptible and highstrung organization At sight of Dr Baleinier
who with a sign made Gervaise and her mate leave the room Adrienne
remained petrified

She felt a kind of giddiness at the thought of the audacity of the man
who dared to present himself to her But when the physician repeated
in the softest tone of affectionate interest Well my poor child how
have we spent the night she pressed her hands to her burning forehead
as if in doubt whether she was awake or sleeping Then staring at the
doctor she half opened her lips but they trembled so much that it was
impossible for her to utter a word Anger indignation contempt and
above all the bitter and acutely painful feeling of a generous heart
whose confidence has been basely betrayed so overpowered Adrienne that
she was unable to break the silence

Come come I see how it is said the doctor shaking his head
sorrowfully you are very much displeased with meis it not so Well
I expected it my dear child

These words pronounced with the most hypocritical effrontery made
Adrienne start up Her pale cheek flushed her large eyes sparkled she
lifted proudly her beautiful head whilst her upper lip curled slightly
with a smile of disdainful bitterness then passing in angry silence
before M Baleinier who retained his seat she directed her swift and
firm steps towards the door This door in which was a little wicket
was fastened on the outside Adrienne turned towards the doctor and
said to him with an imperious gesture Open that door for me

Come my dear Mdlle Adrienne said the physician be calm Let us
talk like good friendsfor you know I am your friend And he inhaled
slowly a pinch of snuff

It appears sir said Adrienne in a voice trembling with indignation
I am not to leave this place today

Alas no In such a state of excitementif you knew how inflamed your
face is and your eyes so feverish your pulse must be at least eighty
to the minuteI conjure you my dear child not to aggravate your
symptoms by this fatal agitation

After looking fixedly at the doctor Adrienne returned with a slow step
and again took her seat on the edge of the bed That is right resumed
M Baleinier only be reasonable and as I said before let us talk
together like good friends

You say well sir replied Adrienne in a collected and perfectly calm
voice let us talk like friends You wish to make me pass for madis
it not so

I wish my dear child that one day you may feel towards me as much
gratitude as you now do aversion The latter I had fully foreseenbut
however painful may be the performance of certain duties we must resign
ourselves to it

M Baleinier sighed as he said this with such a natural air of
conviction that for a moment Adrienne could not repress a movement of
surprise then while her lip curled with a bitter laugh she answered
Oh its very clear you have done all this for my good

Really my dear young ladyhave I ever had any other design than to be
useful to you

I do not know sir if your impudence be not still more odious than
your cowardly treachery

Treachery said M Baleinier shrugging his shoulders with a grieved
air treachery indeed Only reflect my poor childdo you think if
I were not acting with good faith conscientiously in your interest
I should return this morning to meet your indignation for which I was
fully prepared I am the head physician of this asylum which belongs
to mebut I have two of my pupils here doctors like myselfand might
have left them to take care of you but noI could not consent to itI
knew your character your nature your previous history and leaving
out of the question the interest I feel for you I can treat your case
better than any one

Adrienne had heard M Baleinier without interrupting him she now looked
at him fixedly and said Pray sir how much do they pay you to make
me pass for mad

Madame cried M Baleinier who felt stung in spite of himself

You know I am rich continued Adrienne with overwhelming disdain
I will double the sum that they give you Come sirin the name of
friendship as you call it let me have the pleasure of outbidding
them

Your keepers said M Baleinier recovering all his coolness have
informed me in their report of the nights proceedings that you made
similar propositions to them

Pardon me sir I offered them what might be acceptable to poor women
without education whom misfortune has forced to undertake a painful
employmentbut to you sir a man of the world a man of science a man
of great abilitiesthat is quite differentthe pay must be a great
deal higher There is treachery at all prices so do not found your
refusal on the smallness of my offer to those wretched women Tell
mehow much do you want

Your keepers in their report of the night have also spoken of
threats resumed M Baleinier with the same coolness have you any
of those likewise to address me Believe me my poor child you will
do well to exhaust at once your attempts at corruption and your vain
threats of vengeance We shall then come to the true state of the case

So you deem my threats vain cried Mdlle de Cardoville at length
giving way to the full tide of her indignation till then restrained
Do you think sir that when I leave this placefor this outrage must
have an endthat I will not proclaim aloud your infamous treachery Do
you think chat I will not denounce to the contempt and horror of all
your base conspiracy with Madame de SaintDizier Oh do you think that
I will conceal the frightful treatment I have received But mad as
I may be I know that there are laws in this country by which I
will demand a full reparation for myself and shame disgrace and
punishment for you and for those who have employed you Henceforth
between you and me will be hate and war to the death and all my
strength all my intelligence

Permit me to interrupt you my dear Mdlle Adrienne said the doctor
still perfectly calm and affectionate nothing can be more unfavorable
to your cure than to cherish idle hopes they will only tend to keep
up a state of deplorable excitement it is best to put the facts fairly
before you that you may understand clearly your position

1 It is impossible for you to leave this house 2 You can have no
communication with any one beyond its walls 3 No one enters here that
I cannot perfectly depend upon 4 I am completely indifferent to your
threats of vengeance because law and reason are both in my favor

What have you the right to shut me up here

We should never have come to that determination without a number of
reasons of the most serious kind

Oh there are reasons for it it seems

Unfortunately too many

You will perhaps inform me of them

Alas they are only too conclusive and if you should ever apply to
the protection of the laws as you threatened me just now we should be
obliged to state them The fantastical eccentricity of your manner of
living your whimsical mode of dressing up your maids your extravagant
expenditure the story of the Indian prince to whom you offered a royal
hospitality your unprecedented resolution of going to live by yourself
like a young bachelor the adventure of the man found concealed in your
bedchamber finally the report of your yesterdays conversation which
was faithfully taken down in shorthand by a person employed for that
purpose

Yesterday cried Adrienne with as much indignation as surprise

Oh yes to be prepared for every event in case you should
misinterpret the interest we take in you we had all your answers
reported by a man who was concealed behind a curtain in the next room
and really one day in a calmer state of mind when you come to read
over quietly the particulars of what took place you will no longer be
astonished at the resolution we have been forced to adopt

Go on sir said Adrienne with contempt

The facts I have cited being thus confirmed and acknowledged you will
understand my dear Mdlle Adrienne that your friends are perfectly
free from responsibility It was their duty to endeavor to cure this
derangement of mind which at present only shows itself in idle whims
but which were it to increase might seriously compromise the happiness
of your future life Now in my opinion we may hope to see a radical
cure by means of a treatment at once physical and moral but the first
condition of this attempt was to remove you from the scenes which so
dangerously excited your imagination whilst a calm retreat the repose
of a simple and solitary life combined with my anxious I may say
paternal care will gradually bring about a complete recovery

So sir said Adrienne with a bitter laugh the love of a noble
independence generosity the worship of the beautiful detestation of
what is base and odious such are the maladies of which you wish to cure
me I fear that my case is desperate for my aunt has long ago tried to
effect that benevolent purpose

Well we may perhaps not succeed but at least we will attempt it You
see then there is a mass of serious facts quite enough to justify the
determination come to by the familycouncil which puts me completely at
my ease with regard to your menaces It is to that I wish to return a
man of my age and condition never acts lightlyin such circumstances
and you can readily understand what I was saying to you just now In a
word do not hope to leave this place before your complete recovery
and rest assured that I am and shall ever be safe from your resentment
This being once admitted let us talk of your actual state with all the
interest that you naturally inspire

I think sir that considering I am mad you speak to me very
reasonably

Mad no thank heaven my poor child you are not mad yetand I hope
that by my care you will never be so It is to prevent your becoming
mad that one must take it in time and believe me it is full time You
look at me with such an air of surprisenow tell me what interest can
I have in talking to you thus Is it the hatred of your aunt that I wish
to favor To what end I would ask What can she do for me or against
me I think of her at this moment neither more nor less than I thought
yesterday Is it a new language that I hold to yourself Did I not speak
to you yesterday many times of the dangerous excitement of mind in
which you were and of your singular whims and fancies It is true
I made use of stratagem to bring you hither No doubt I did so I
hastened to avail myself of the opportunity which you yourself offered
my poor dear child for you would never have come hither with your own
good will One day or the other we must have found some pretext to get
you here and I said to myself Her interest before all Do your duty
let whatever will betide

Whilst M Baleinier was speaking Adriennes countenance which had
hitherto expressed alternately indignation and disdain assumed an
indefinable look of anguish and horror On hearing this man talk in such
a natural manner and with such an appearance of sincerity justice and
reason she felt herself more alarmed than ever An atrocious deception
clothed in such forms frightened her a hundred times more than the
avowed hatred of Madame de SaintDizier This audacious hypocrisy seemed
to her so monstrous that she believed it almost impossible

Adrienne had so little the art of hiding her emotions that the
doctor a skillful and profound physiognomist instantly perceived the
impression he had produced Come said he to himself that is a great
step Fright has succeeded to disdain and anger Doubt will come next
I shall not leave this place till she has said to me Return soon my
good M Baleinier With a voice of sorrowful emotion which seemed to
come from the very depths of his heart the doctor thus continued I
see you are still suspicious of me All I can say to you is falsehood
fraud hypocrisy hateis it not soHate you why in heavens name
should I hate you What have you done to me or ratheryou will perhaps
attach more value to this reason from a man of my sort added M
Baleinier bitterly or rather what interest have I to hate youYou
that have only been reduced to the state in which you are by an over
abundance of the most generous instinctsyou that are suffering as
it were from an excess of good qualitiesyou can bring yourself coolly
and deliberately to accuse an honest man who has never given you any
but marks of affection of the basest the blackest the most abominable
crime of which a human being could be guilty Yes I call it a crime
because the audacious deception of which you accuse me would not deserve
any other name Really my poor child it is hardvery hardand I now
see that an independent spirit may sometimes exhibit as much injustice
and intolerance as the most narrow mind It does not incense menoit
only pains me yes I assure youit pains me cruelly And the doctor
drew his hand across his moist eyes

It is impossible to give the accent the look the gesture of M
Baleinier as he thus expressed himself The most able and practiced
lawyer or the greatest actor in the world could not have played this
scene with more effect than the doctoror rather no one could have
played it so wellM Baleinier carried away by the influence of the
situations was himself half convinced of what he said

In few words he felt all the horror of his own perfidy but he felt also
that Adrienne could not believe it for there are combinations of
such nefarious character that pure and upright minds are unable to
comprehend them as possible If a lofty spirit looks down into the abyss
of evil beyond a certain depth it is seized with giddiness and no
longer able to distinguish one object from the other

And then the most perverse of men have a day an hour a moment in
which the good instincts planted in the heart of every creature appear
in spite of themselves Adrienne was too interesting was in too cruel a
position for the doctor mot to feel some pity for her in his heart the
tone of sympathy which for some time past he had been obliged to assume
towards her and the sweet confidence of the young girl in return had
become for this man habitual and necessary ratifications But sympathy
and habit were now to yield to implacable necessity

Thus the Marquis dAigrigny had idolized his mother dying she called
him to herand he turned away from the last prayer of a parent in the
agony of death After such an example how could M Baleinier hesitate
to sacrifice Adrienne The members of the Order of which he formed a
part were bound to himbut he was perhaps still more strongly bound to
them for a long partnership in evil creates terrible and indissoluble
ties

The moment M Baleinier finished his fervid address to Mdlle de
Cardoville the slide of the wicket in the door was softly pushed back
and a pair of eyes peered attentively into the chamber unperceived by
the doctor

Adrienne could not withdraw her gaze from the physicians which seemed
to fascinate her Mute overpowered seized with a vague terror unable
to penetrate the dark depths of this mans soul moved in spite of
herself by the accent of sorrow half feigned and half realthe young
lady had a momentary feeling of doubt For the first time it came into
her mind that M Baleinier might perhaps be committing a frightful
errorcommitting it in good faith

Besides the anguish of the past night the dangers of her position
her feverish agitation all concurred to fill her mind with trouble and
indecision She looked at the physician with ever increasing surprise
and making a violent effort not to yield to a weakness of which she
partly foresaw the dreadful consequences she exclaimed No no sir
I will not I cannot believe it You have too much skill too much
experience to commit such an error

An error said M Baleinier in a grave and sorrowful tone Let me
speak to you in the name of that skill and experience which you are
pleased to ascribe to me Hear me but for a moment my dear child and
then I will appeal to yourself

To me replied the young girl in a kind of stupor you wish to
persuade me that Then interrupting herself she added with a
convulsive laugh This only is wanting to your triumphto bring me to
confess that I am madthat my proper place is herethat I owe you

Gratitude Yes you do owe it me even as I told you at the
commencement of this conversation Listen to me then my words may be
cruel but there are wounds which can only be cured with steel and fire
I conjure you my dear childreflectthrow back one impartial glance
at your past lifeweigh your own thoughtsand you will be afraid of
yourself Remember those moments of strange excitement during which
as you have told me you seemed to soar above the earthand above all
while it is yet timewhile you preserve enough clearness of mind to
compare and judgecompare I entreat your manner of living with that
of other ladies of your age Is there a single one who acts as you
act who thinks as you think unless indeed you imagine yourself so
superior to other women that in virtue of that supremacy you can
justify a life and habits that have no parallel in the world

I have never had such stupid pride you know it well said Adrienne
looking at the doctor with growing terror

Then my dear child to what are we to attribute your strange and
inexplicable mode of life Can you even persuade yourself that it is
founded on reason Oh my child take careAs yet you only indulge
in charming originalities of conduct poetical eccentricities sweet
and vague reveriesbut the tendency is fatal the downward course
irresistible Take care take carethe healthful graceful spiritual
portion of your intelligence has yet the upper hand and imprints its
stamp upon all your extravagances but you do not know believe me with
what frightful force the insane portion of the mind at a given moment
develops itself and strangles up the rest Then we have no longer
graceful eccentricities like yours but ridiculous sordid hideous
delusions

Oh you frighten me said the unfortunate girl as she passed her
trembling hands across her burning brow

Then continued M Baleinier in an agitated voice then the last
rays of intelligence are extinguished then madnessfor we must
pronounce the dreaded wordgets the upper hand and displays itself in
furious and savage transports

Like the woman upstairs murmured Adrienne as with fixed and eager
look she raised her finger towards the ceiling

Sometimes continued the doctor alarmed himself at the terrible
consequences of his own words but yielding to the inexorable fatality
of his situation sometimes madness takes a stupid and brutal form the
unfortunate creature who is attacked by it preserves nothing human
but the shapehas only the instincts of the lower animalseats with
voracity and moves ever backwards and forwards in the cell in which
such a being is obliged to be confined That is all its lifeall

Like the woman yonder cried Adrienne with a still wilder look as
she slowly raised her arm towards the window that was visible on the
other side of the building

Whyyes said M Baleinier Like you unhappy child those women
were young fair and sensible but like you alas they had in them the
fatal germ of insanity which not having been destroyed in time grew
and grew larger and ever larger until it overspread and destroyed
their reason

Oh mercy cried Mdlle de Cardoville whose head was getting confused
with terror mercy do not tell me such thingsI am afraid Take
me from this placeoh take me from this place she added with a
heartrending accent for if I remain here I shall end by going mad
No added she struggling with the terrible agony which assailed her
no do not hope it I shall not become mad I have all my reason I
am not blind enough to believe what you tell me Doubtless I live
differently from others think differently from others am shocked by
things that do not offend others but what does all this prove Only
that I am different from others Have I a bad heart Am I envious or
selfish My ideas are singular I knewyes I confess itbut then
M Baleinier is not their tendency good generous nobleOh cried
Adriennes supplicating voice while her tears flowed abundantly I
have never in my life done one malicious action my worst errors have
arisen from excess of generosity Is it madness to wish to see everybody
about one too happy And again if you are mad you must feel it
yourselfand I do not feel itand yetI scarcely knowyou tell me
such terrible things of those two women You ought to know these things
better than I But then added Mdlle de Cardoville with an accent
of the deepest despair something ought to have been done Why if you
felt an interest for me did you wait so long Why did you not take pity
on me sooner But the most frightful fact is that I do not know whether
I ought to believe youfor all this may be a snarebut no no
you weepit is true thenyou weep She looked anxiously at M
Baleinier who notwithstanding his cynical philosophy could not
restrain his tears at the sight of these nameless tortures

You weep over me she continued so it is true But good heaven
must there not be something done I will do all that you wishallso
that I may not be like those women But if it should be too late no it
is not too latesay it is not too late my good M Baleinier Oh now
I ask your pardon for what I said when you came inbut then I did not
know you seeI did not know

To these few broken words interrupted by sobs and rushing forth in a
sort of feverish excitement succeeded a silence of some minutes during
which the deeply affected physician dried his tears His resolution
had almost failed him Adrienne hid her face in her hands Suddenly she
again lifted her head her countenance was calmer than before though
agitated by a nervous trembling

M Baleinier she resumed with touching dignity I hardly know what
I said to you just now Terror I think made me wander I have again
collected myself Hear me I know that I am in your power I know that
nothing can deliver me from it Are you an implacable enemy or are you
a friend I am not able to determine Do you really apprehend as
you assure me that what is now eccentricity will hereafter become
madnessor are you rather the accomplice in some infernal machination
You alone can answer In spite of my boasted courage I confess myself
conquered Whatever is required of meyou understand whatever it may
be I will subscribe to I give you my word and you know that I hold it
sacredyou have therefore no longer any interest to keep me here If
on the contrary you really think my reason in dangerand I own that
you have awakened in my mind vague but frightful doubtstell it me
and I will believe you I am alone at your mercy without friends
without counsel I trust myself blindly to you I know not whether I
address myself to a deliverer or a destroyerbut I say to youhere is
my happinesshere is my lifetake itI have no strength to dispute it
with you

These touching words full of mournful resignation and almost hopeless
reliance gave the finishing stroke to the indecision of M Baleinier
Already deeply moved by this scene and without reflecting on the
consequences of what he was about to do he determined at all events
to dissipate the terrible and unjust fears with which he had inspired
Adrienne Sentiments of remorse and pity which now animated the
physician were visible in his countenance

Alas they were too visible The moment he approached to take the hand
of Mdlle de Cardoville a low but sharp voice exclaimed from behind the
wicket M Baleinier

Rodin muttered the startled doctor to himself hes been spying on
me

Who calls you asked the lady of the physician

A person that I promised to meet here this morning replied he with
the utmost depression to go with him to St Marys Convent which is
close at hand

And what answer have you to give me said Adrienne with mortal
anguish

After a moments solemn silence during which he turned his face towards
the wicket the doctor replied in a voice of deep emotion I amwhat
I have always beena friend incapable of deceiving you

Adrienne became deadly pale Then extending her hand to M Baleinier
she said to him in a voice that she endeavored to render calm Thank
youI will have couragebut will it be very long

Perhaps a month Solitude reflection a proper regimen my attentive
care may do much You will be allowed everything that is compatible
with your situation Every attention will be paid you If this room
displeases you I will see you have another

Nothis or anotherit is of little consequence answered Adrienne
with an air of the deepest dejection

Come come be of good courage There is no reason to despair

Perhaps you flatter me said Adrienne with the shadow of a smile
Return soon she added my dear M Baleinier my only hope rests in
you now

Her head fell upon her bosom her hands upon her knees and she remained
sitting on the edge of the bed pale motionless overwhelmed with woe

Mad she said when M Baleinier had disappeared Perhaps mad

We have enlarged upon this episode much less romantic than it may
appear Many times have motives of interest or vengeance or perfidious
machination led to the abuse of the imprudent facility with which
inmates are received in certain private lunatic asylums from the hands
of their families or friends

We shall subsequently explain our views as to the establishment of a
system of inspection by the crown or the civil magistrates for
the periodical survey of these institutions and others of no less
importance at present placed beyond the reach of all superintendence
These latter are the nunneries of which we will presently have an
example




CHAPTER XLVI PRESENTIMENTS

Whilst the preceding events took place in Dr Baleiniers asylum other
scenes were passing about the same hour at Frances Baudoins in the
Rue BriseMiche

Seven oclock in the morning had just struck at St Mary church the day
was dark and gloomy and the sleet rattled against the windows of the
joyless chamber of Dagoberts wife

As yet ignorant of her sons arrest Frances had waited for him the
whole of the preceding evening and a good part of the night with the
most anxious uneasiness yielding at length to fatigue and sleep about
three oclock in the morning she had thrown herself on a mattress
beside the bed of Rose and Blanche But she rose with the first dawn
of day to ascend to Agricolas garret in the very faint hope that he
might have returned home some hours before

Rose and Blanche had just risen and dressed themselves They were alone
in the sad chilly apartment Spoilsport whom Dagobert had left in
Paris was stretched at full length near the cold stove with his long
muzzle resting on his forepaws he kept his eye fixed on the sisters

Having slept but little during the night they had perceived the
agitation and anguish of Dagoberts wife They had seen her walk up and
down now talking to herself now listening to the least noise that came
up the staircase and now kneeling before the crucifix placed at one
extremity of the room The orphans were not aware that whilst she
brayed with fervor on behalf of her son this excellent woman was
praying for them also For the state of their souls filled her with
anxiety and alarm

The day before when Dagobert had set out for Chartres Frances having
assisted Rose and Blanche to rise had invited them to say their morning
prayer they answered with the utmost simplicity that they did not know
any and that they never more than addressed their mother who was in
heaven When Frances struck with painful surprise spoke to them of
catechism confirmation communion the sisters opened widely their
large eyes with astonishment understanding nothing of such talk

According to her simple faith terrified at the ignorance of the young
girls in matters of religion Dagoberts wife believed their souls to
be in the greatest peril the more so as having asked them if they had
ever been baptized at the same time explaining to them the nature of
that sacrament the orphans answered they did not think they had since
there was neither church nor priest in the village where they were born
during their mothers exile in Siberia

Placing ones self in the position of Frances you understand how much
she was grieved and alarmed for in her eyes these young girls
whom she already loved tenderly so charmed was she with their sweet
disposition were nothing but poor heathens innocently doomed to
eternal damnation So unable to restrain her tears or conceal her
horrors she had clasped them in her arms promising immediately to
attend to their salvation and regretting that Dagobert had not thought
of having them baptized by the way Now it must be confessed that this
notion had never once occurred to the exgrenadier

When she went to her usual Sunday devotions Frances had not dared to
take Rose and Blanche with her as their complete ignorance of sacred
things would have rendered their presence at church if not useless
scandalous but in her own fervent prayers she implored celestial mercy
for these orphans who did not themselves know the desperate position of
their souls

Rose and Blanche were now left alone in the absence of Dagoberts wife
They were still dressed in mourning their charming faces seeming
even more pensive than usual Though they were accustomed to a life of
misfortune they had been struck since their arrival in the Rue Brise
Miche with the painful contrast between the poor dwelling which they
had come to inhabit and the wonders which their young imagination had
conceived of Paris that golden city of their dreams But soon this
natural astonishment was replaced by thoughts of singular gravity for
their age The contemplation of such honest and laborious poverty made
the orphans have reflections no longer those of children but of young
women Assisted by their admirable spirit of justice and of sympathy for
all that is good by their noble heart by a character at once delicate
and courageous they had observed and meditated much during the last
twentyfour hours

Sister said Rose to Blanche when Frances had quitted the room
Dagoberts poor wife is very uneasy Did you remark in the night how
agitated she was how she wept and prayed

I was grieved to see it sister and wondered what could be the cause

I am almost afraid to guess Perhaps we may be the cause of her
uneasiness

Why so sister Because we cannot say prayers nor tell if we have ever
been baptized

That seemed to give her a good deal of pain it is true I was quite
touched by it for it proves that she loves us tenderly But I could not
understand how we ran such terrible danger as she said we did

Nor I either sister We have always tried not to displease our mother
who sees and hears us

We love those who love us we are resigned to whatever may happen to
us So who can reproach us with any harm

No one But perhaps we may do some without meaning it

We

Yes and therefore I thought We may perhaps be the cause of her
uneasiness

How so

Listen sister yesterday Madame Baudoin tried to work at those sacks
of coarse cloth there on the table

Yes but in about an halfhour she told us sorrowfully that she could
not go on because her eyes failed her and she could not see clearly

So that she is not able to earn her living

Nobut her son M Agricola works for her He looks so good so gay
so frank and so happy to devote himself for his mother Oh indeed he
is the worthy brother of our angel Gabriel

You will see my reason for speaking of this Our good old Dagobert told
us that when we arrived here he had only a few pieces of money left

That is true

Now both he and his wife are unable to earn their living what can a
poor old soldier like him do

You are right he only knows how to love us and take care of us like
his children

It must then be M Agricola who will have to support his father for
Gabriel is a poor priest who possesses nothing and can render no
assistance to those who have brought him up So M Agricola will have to
support the whole family by himself

Doubtlesshe owes it to father and motherit is his duty and he will
do it with a good will

Yes sisterbut he owes us nothing

What do you say Blanche

He is obliged to work for us also as we possess nothing in the world

I had not thought of that True

It is all very well sister for our father to be Duke and Marshal of
France as Dagobert tells us it is all very well for us to hope great
things from this medal but as long as father is not here and our hopes
are not realized we shall be merely poor orphans obliged to remain a
burden to this honest family to whom we already owe so much and who
find it so hard to live that

Why do you pause sister

What I am about to say would make other people laugh but you will
understand it Yesterday when Dagoberts wife saw poor Spoilsport at
his dinner she said sorrowfully Alas he eats as much as a manso
that I could almost have cried to hear her They must be very poor and
yet we have come to increase their poverty

The sisters looked sadly at each other while Spoilsport pretended not
to know they were talking of his voracity

Sister I understand said Rose after a moments silence Well we
must not be at the charge of any one We are young and have courage
Till our fate is decided let us fancy ourselves daughters of
workmen After all is not our grandfather a workman Let us find some
employment and earn our own living It must be so proud and happy to
earn ones living

Good little sister said Blanche kissing Rose What happiness You
have forestalled my thought kiss me

How so

Your project is mine exactly Yesterday when I heard Dagoberts wife
complain so sadly that she had lost her sight I looked into your large
eyes which reminded me of my own and said to myself Well this poor
old woman may have lost her sight but Rose and Blanche Simon can see
pretty clearlywhich is a compensation added Blanche with a smile

And after all resumed Rose smiling in her turn the young ladies
in question are not so very awkward as not to be able to sew up great
sacks of coarse cloththough it may chafe their fingers a little

So we had both the same thought as usual only I wished to surprise
you and waited till we were alone to tell you my plan

Yes but there is something teases me

What is that

First of all Dagobert and his wife will be sure to say to us Young
ladies you are not fitted for such work What daughters of a Marshal
of France sewing up great ugly bags And then if we insist upon it
they will add Well we have no work to give you If you want any you
must hunt for it What would Misses Simon do then

The fact is that when Dagobert has made up his mind to anything

Oh even then if we coax him well

Yes in certain things but in others he is immovable It is just as
when upon the journey we wished to prevent his doing so much for us

Sister an idea strikes me cried Rose an excellent idea

What is it quick

You know the young woman they call Mother Bunch who appears to be so
serviceable and persevering

Oh yes and so timid and discreet She seems always to be afraid
of giving offence even if she looks at one Yesterday she did not
perceive that I saw her but her eyes were fixed on you with so good and
sweet an expression that tears came into mine at the very sight of it

Well we must ask her how she gets work for certainly she lives by her
labor

You are right She will tell us all about it and when we know
Dagobert may scold us or try to make great ladies of us but we will be
as obstinate as he is

That is it we must show some spirit We will prove to him as he says
himself that we have soldiers blood in our veins

We will say to him Suppose as you say we should one day be rich my
good Dagobert we shall only remember this time with the more pleasure

It is agreed then is it not Rose The first time we are alone
with Mother Bunch we must make her our confidant and ask her for
information She is so good a person that she will not refuse us

And when father comes home he will be pleased I am sure with our
courage

And will approve our wish to support ourselves as if we were alone in
the world

On these words of her sister Rose started A cloud of sadness almost
of alarm passed over her charming countenance as she exclaimed Oh
sister what a horrible idea

What is the matter your look frightens me

At the moment I heard you say that our father would approve our wish
to support ourselves as if we were alone in the worlda frightful
thought struck meI know not whybut feel how my heart beatsjust as
if some misfortune were about to happen us

It is true your poor heart beats violently But what was this thought
You alarm me

When we were prisoners they did not at least separate us and
besides the prison was a kind of shelter

A sad one though shared with you

But if when arrived here any accident had parted us from Dagobertif
we had been left alone without help in this great town

Oh sister do not speak of that It would indeed be terrible What
would become of us kind heaven

This cruel thought made the girls remain for a moment speechless with
emotion Their sweet faces which had just before glowed with a noble
hope grew pale and sad After a pretty long silence Rose uplifted
her eyes now filled with tears Why does this thought she said
trembling affect us so deeply sister My heart sinks within me as if
it were really to happen to us

I feel as frightened as you yourself Alas were we both to be lost in
this immense city what would become of us

Do not let us give way to such ideas Blanche Are we not here in
Dagoberts house in the midst of good people

And yet sister said Rose with a pensive air it is perhaps good
for us to have had this thought

Why so

Because we shall now find this poor lodging all the better as it
affords a shelter from all our fears And when thanks to our labor
we are no longer a burden to any one what more can we need until the
arrival of our father

We shall want for nothingthere you are rightbut still why did this
thought occur to us and why does it weigh so heavily on our minds

Yes indeedwhy Are we not here in the midst of friends that love us
How could we suppose that we should ever be left alone in Paris It is
impossible that such a misfortune should happen to usis it not my
dear sister

Impossible said Rose shuddering If the day before we reached that
village in Germany where poor Jovial was killed any one had said to
us Tomorrow you will be in prisonwe should have answered as now
It is impossible Is not Dagobert here to protect us what have we to
fear And yet sister the day after we were in prison at Leipsic

Oh do not speak thus my dear sister It frightens me

By a sympathetic impulse the orphans took one another by the hand
while they pressed close together and looked around with involuntary
fear The sensation they felt was in fact deep strange inexplicable
and yet loweringone of those dark presentiments which come over us
in spite of ourselvesthose fatal gleams of prescience which throw a
lurid light on the mysterious profundities of the future

Unaccountable glimpses of divination often no sooner perceived than
forgottenbut when justified by the event appearing with all the
attributes of an awful fatality

The daughters of Marshal Simon were still absorbed in the mournful
reverie which these singular thoughts had awakened when Dagoberts
wife returning from her sons chamber entered the room with a
painfully agitated countenance




CHAPTER XLVII THE LETTER

Frances agitation was so perceptible that Rose could not help
exclaiming Good gracious what is the matter

Alas my dear young ladies I can no longer conceal it from you said
Frances bursting into tears Since yesterday I have not seen him I
expected my son to supper as usual and he never came but I would not
let you see how much I suffered I continued to expect him minute after
minute for ten years he has never gone up to bed without coming to kiss
me so I spent a good part of the night close to the door listening if
I could hear his step But he did not come and at last about three
oclock in the morning I threw myself down upon the mattress I have
just been to see for I still had a faint hope if my son had come in
this morning

Well madame

There is no sign of him said the poor mother drying her eyes

Rose and Blanche looked at each other with emotion the same thought
filled the minds of both if Agricola should not return how would this
family live would they not in such an event become doubly burdensome

But perhaps madame said Blanche M Agricola remained too late at
his work to return home last night

Oh no no he would have returned in the middle of the night because
he knew what uneasiness he would cause me by stopping out Alas some
misfortune must have happened to him Perhaps he has been injured at the
forge he is so persevering at his work Oh my poor boy and as if I
did not feel enough anxiety about him I am also uneasy about the poor
young woman who lives upstairs

Why so madame

When I left my sons room I went into hers to tell her my grief for
she is almost a daughter to me but I did not find her in the little
closet where she lives and the bed had not even been slept in Where
can she have gone so earlyshe that never goes out

Rose and Blanche looked at each other with fresh uneasiness for they
counted much upon Mother Bunch to help them in the resolution they had
taken Fortunately both they and Frances were soon to be satisfied
on this head for they heard two low knocks at the door and the
sempstresss voice saying Can I come in Mrs Baudoin

By a spontaneous impulse Rose and Blanche ran to the door and opened
it to the young girl Sleet and snow had been falling incessantly since
the evening before the gingham dress of the young sempstress her
scanty cotton shawl and the black net cap which leaving uncovered
two thick bands of chestnut hair encircled her pale and interesting
countenance were all dripping wet the cold had given a livid
appearance to her thin white hands it was only in the fire of her blue
eyes generally so soft and timid that one perceived the extraordinary
energy which this frail and fearful creature had gathered from the
emergency of the occasion

Dear me where do you come from my good Mother Bunch said Frances
Just now in going to see if my son had returned I opened your door
and was quite astonished to find you gone out so early

I bring you news of Agricola

Of my son cried Frances trembling all over What has happened to
him Did you see himDid you speak to himWhere is he

I did not see him but I know where he is Then perceiving that
Frances grew very pale the girl added He is well he is in no
danger

Blessed be God who has pity on a poor sinnerwho yesterday restored
me my husband and today after a night of cruel anguish assures me of
the safety of my child So saying Frances knelt down upon the floor
and crossed herself with fervor

During the moment of silence caused by this pious action Rose and
Blanche approached Mother Bunch and said to her in a low voice with
an expression of touching interest How wet you are you must be very
cold Take care you do not get ill We did not venture to ask Madame
Frances to light the fire in the stove but now we will do so

Surprised and affected by the kindness of Marshal Simons daughters
the hunchback who was more sensible than others to the least mark of
kindness answered them with a look of ineffable gratitude I am much
obliged to you young ladies but I am accustomed to the cold and am
moreover so anxious that I do not feel it

And my son said Frances rising after she had remained some moments
on her knees why did he stay out all night And could you tell me
where to find him my good girl Will he soon come why is he so long

I assure you Agricola is well but I must inform you that for some
time

Well

You must have courage mother

Oh the blood runs cold in my veins What has happened why shall I not
see him

Alas he is arrested

Arrested cried Rose and Blanche with affright

Father Thy will be done said Frances but it is a great misfortune
Arrested for what He is so good and honest that there must be some
mistake

The day before yesterday resumed Mother Bunch I received an
anonymous letter by which I was informed that Agricola might be
arrested at any moment on account of his song We agreed together that
he should go to the rich young lady in the Rue de Babylone who had
offered him her services and ask her to procure bail for him to
prevent his going to prison Yesterday morning he set out to go to the
young ladys

And neither of you told me anything of all thiswhy did you hide it
from me

That we might not make you uneasy mother for counting on the
generosity of that young lady I expected Agricola back every moment
When he did not come yesterday evening I said to myself Perhaps the
necessary formalities with regard to the bail have detained him But
the time passed on and he did not make his appearance So I watched
all night expecting him

So you did not go to bed either my good girl

No I was too uneasy This morning not being able to conquer my fears
I went out before dawn I remembered the address of the young lady in
the Rue de Babylone and I ran thither

Oh well said Frances with anxiety you were in the right
According to what my son told us that young lady appeared very good and
generous

Mother Bunch shook her head sorrowfully a tear glittered in her eyes
as she continued It was still dark when I arrived at the Rue de
Babylone I waited till daylight was come

Poor child you who are so weak and timid said Frances with deep
feeling to go so far and in this dreadful weatherOh you have been
a real daughter to me

Has not Agricola been like a brother to me said Mother Bunch softly
with a slight blush

When it was daylight she resumed I ventured to ring at the door
of the little summerhouse a charming young girl but with a sad
pale countenance opened the door to me I come in the name of an
unfortunate mother in despair said I to her immediately for I was so
poorly dressed that I feared to be sent away as a beggar but seeing on
the contrary that the young girl listened to me with kindness I asked
her if the day before a young workman had not come to solicit a
great favor of her mistress Alas yes answered the young girl my
mistress was going to interest herself for him and hearing that he was
in danger of being arrested she concealed him here unfortunately his
retreat was discovered and yesterday afternoon at four oclock he was
arrested and taken to prison

Though the orphans took no part in this melancholy conversation the
sorrow and anxiety depicted in their countenances showed how much they
felt for the sufferings of Dagoberts wife

But the young lady cried Frances You should have tried to see her
my good Mother Bunch and begged her not to abandon my son She is so
rich that she must have influence and her protection might save us from
great calamities

Alas said Mother Bunch with bitter grief we must renounce this
last hope

Why said Frances If this young lady is so good she will have
pity upon us when she knows that my son is the only support of a whole
family and that for him to go to prison is worse than for another
because it will reduce us all to the greatest misery

But this young lady replied the girl according to what I learned
from her weeping maid was taken last evening to a lunatic asylum it
appears she is mad

Mad Oh it is horrible for her and for us alsofor now there is no
hope What will become of us without my son Oh merciful heaven The
unfortunate woman hid her face in her hands

A profound silence followed this heartrending outburst Rose and
Blanche exchanged mournful glances for they perceived that their
presence augmented the weighty embarrassments of this family Mother
Bunch worn out with fatigue a prey to painful emotions and trembling
with cold in her wet clothes sank exhausted on a chair and reflected
on their desperate position

That position was indeed a cruel one

Often in times of political disturbances or of agitation amongst the
laboring classes caused by want of work or by the unjust reduction of
wages the result of the powerful coalition of the capitalistsoften
are whole families reduced by a measure of preventive imprisonment to
as deplorable a position as that of Dagoberts household by Agricolas
arrestan arrest which as will afterwards appear was entirely owing
to Rodins arts

Now with regard to this precautionary imprisonment of which the
victims are almost always honest and industrious mechanics driven to
the necessity of combining together by the In organization of Labor and
the Insufficiency of Wages it is painful to see the law which ought to
be equal for all refuse to strikers what it grants to mastersbecause
the latter can dispose of a certain sum of money Thus under many
circumstances the rich man by giving bail can escape the annoyance
and inconveniences of a preventive incarceration he deposits a sum of
money pledges his word to appear on a certain day and goes back to
his pleasures his occupations and the sweet delights of his family
Nothing can be better an accused person is innocent till he is proved
guilty we cannot be too much impressed with that indulgent maxim It is
well for the rich man that he can avail himself of the mercy of the law
But how is it with the poor

Not only has he no bail to give for his whole capital consists of his
daily labor but it is upon him chiefly that the rigors of preventive
measures must fall with a terrible and fatal force

For the rich man imprisonment is merely the privation of ease
and comfort tedious hours and the pain of separation from his
familydistresses not unworthy of interest for all suffering deserves
pity and the tears of the rich man separated from his children are as
bitter as those of the poor But the absence of the rich man does not
condemn his family to hunger and cold and the incurable maladies caused
by exhaustion and misery

For the workman on the contrary imprisonment means want misery
sometimes death to those most dear to him Possessing nothing he is
unable to find bail and he goes to prison But if he have as it often
happens an old infirm father or mother a sick wife or children in
the cradle What will become of this unfortunate family They could
hardly manage to live from day to day upon the wages of this man wages
almost always insufficient and suddenly this only resource will be
wanting for three or four months together

What will this family do To whom will they have recourse

What will become of these infirm old men these sickly wives these
little children unable to gain their daily bread If they chance to
have a little linen and a few spare clothes these will be carried
to the pawnbrokers and thus they will exist for a week or sobut
afterwards

And if winter adds the rigors of the season to this frightful and
inevitable misery

Then will the imprisoned artisan see in his minds eyes during the long
and sleepless nights those who are dear to him wan gaunt haggard
exhausted stretched almost naked upon filthy straw or huddled close
together to warm their frozen limbs And should he afterwards be
acquitted it is ruin and desolation that he finds on his return to his
poor dwelling

And then after that long cessation from labor he will find it
difficult to return to his old employers How many days will be lost in
seeking for work and a day without employment is a day without bread

Let us repeat our opinion that if under various circumstances the law
did not afford to the rich the facility of giving bail we could only
lament over all such victims of individual and inevitable misfortune
But since the law does provide the means of setting provisionally at
liberty those who possess a certain sum of money why should it deprive
of this advantage those very persons for whom liberty is indeed
indispensable as it involves the existence of themselves and families

Is there any remedy for this deplorable state of things We believe
there is

The law has fixed the minimum of bail at five hundred francs Now five
hundred francs represent upon the average six months labor of an
industrious workman

If he have a wife and two children which is also about the average it
is evidently quite impossible for him to have saved any such sum

So to ask of such a man five hundred francs to enable him to continue
to support his family is in fact to put him beyond the pale of the law
though more than any one else he requires its protection because of
the disastrous consequences which his imprisonment entails upon others

Would it not be equitable and humane a noble and salutary example
to accept in every case where bail is allowed and where the good
character of the accused could be honorably established moral
guarantees in the absence of material ones from those who have no
capital but their labor and their integrityto accept the word of an
honest man to appear upon the day of trial Would it not be great and
moral in these days to raise the value of the lighted word and exalt
man in his own eyes by showing him that his promise was held to be
sufficient security

Will you so degrade the dignity of man as to treat this proposition as
an impossible and Utopian dream We ask how many prisoners of war have
ever broken their parole and if officers and soldiers are not brothers
of the workingman

Without exaggerating the virtue of promisekeeping in the honest and
laborious poor we feel certain that an engagement taken by the accused
to appear on the day of trial would be always fulfilled not only with
fidelity but with the warmest gratitudefor his family would not have
suffered by his absence thanks to the indulgence of the law

There is also another fact of which France may well be proud It is
that her magistrates although miserably paid as the army itself are
generally wise upright humane and independent they have the true
feeling of their own useful and sacred mission they know how to
appreciate the wants and distresses of the working classes with whom
they are so often brought in contact to them might be safely granted
the power of fixing those cases in which a moral security the only one
that can be given by the honest and necessitous man should be received
as sufficient10

Finally if those who make the laws have so low an opinion of the people
as to reject with disdain the suggestions we have ventured to throw
out let them at least so reduce the minimum of bail as to render it
available for those who have most need to escape the fruitless rigors of
imprisonment Let them take as their lowest limit the months wages of
an artisansay eighty francs

This sum would still be exorbitant but with the aid of friends the
pawnbrokers and some little advances eighty francs might perhaps be
foundnot always it is truebut still sometimesand at all events
many families would be rescued from frightful misery

Having made these observations let us return to Dagoberts family who
in consequence of the preventive arrest of Agricola were now reduced to
an almost hopeless state

The anguish of Dagoberts wife increased the more she reflected on her
situation for including the marshals daughters four persons were
left absolutely without resource It must be confessed however that
the excellent mother thought less of herself than of the grief which
her son must feel in thinking over her deplorable position

At this moment there was a knock at the door

Who is there said Frances

It is meFather Loriot

Come in said Dagoberts wife

The dyer who also performed the functions of a porter appeared at the
door of the room This time his arms were no longer of a bright apple
green but of a magnificent violet

Mrs Baudoin said Father Loriot here is a letter that the giver of
holy water at Saint Merelys has just brought from Abbe Dubois with
a request that I would bring it up to you immediately as it is very
pressing

A letter from my confessor said Frances in astonishment and as she
took it added Thank you Father Loriot

You do not want anything

No Father Loriot

My respects to the ladies and the dyer went out

Mother Bunch will you read this letter for me said Frances anxious
to learn the contents of the missive in question

Yes motherand the young girl read as follows

MY DEAR MADAME BAUDOINI am in the habit of hearing you Tuesday and
Saturday but I shall not be at liberty either tomorrow or the last day
of the week you must then come to me this morning unless you wish to
remain a whole week without approaching the tribunal of penance

Good heavens a week cried Dagoberts wife Alas I am only too
conscious of the necessity of going there today notwithstanding the
trouble and grief in which I am plunged

Then addressing herself to the orphans she continued Heaven has
heard the prayers that I made for you my dear young ladies this very
day I shall be able to consult a good and holy man with regard to the
great dangers to which you are exposed Poor dear souls that are so
innocent and yet so guilty without any fault of your own Heaven is my
witness that my heart bleeds for you as much as for my son

Rose and Blanche looked at each other in confusion they could not
understand the fears with which the state of their souls inspired
the wife of Dagobert The latter soon resumed addressing the young
sempstress

My good girl will you render me yet another service

Certainly

My husband took Agricolas weeks wages with him to pay his journey
to Chartres It was all the money I had in the house I am sure that my
poor child had none about him and in prison he will perhaps want some
Therefore take my silver cup fork and spoon the two pair of sheets
that remain over and my wadded silk shawl that Agricola gave me on my
birthday and carry them all to the pawnbrokers I will try and find
out in which prison my son is confined and will send him half of
the little sum we get upon the things the rest will serve us till my
husband comes home And then what shall we do What a blow for himand
only more misery in prospectsince my son is in prison and I have
lost my sight Almighty Father cried the unfortunate mother with an
expression of impatient and bitter grief why am I thus afflicted Have
I not done enough to deserve some pity if not for myself at least for
those belonging to me But immediately reproaching herself for this
outburst she added No no I ought to accept with thankfulness all
that Thou sandiest me Forgive me for these complaints or punish only
myself

Be of good courage mother said Mother Bunch Agricola is innocent
and will not remain long in prison

But now I think of it resumed Dagoberts wife to go to the
pawnbrokers will make you lose much time my poor girl

I can make up that in the night Madame Frances I could not sleep
knowing you in such trouble Work will amuse me

Yes but the candles

Never mind I am a little beforehand with my work said the poor girl
telling a falsehood

Kiss me at least said Frances with moist eyes for you are the
very best creature in the world So saying she hastened cut of the
room

Rose and Blanche were left alone with Mother Bunch at length had
arrived the moment for which they had waited with so much impatience
Dagoberts wife proceeded to St Merely Church where her confessor was
expecting to see her




CHAPTER XLVIII THE CONFESSIONAL

Nothing could be more gloomy than the appearance of St Merely Church
on this dark and snowy winters day Frances stopped a moment beneath
the porch to behold a lugubrious spectacle

While a priest was mumbling some words in a low voice two or three
dirty choristers in soiled surplices were charting the prayers for the
dead with an absent and sullen air round a plain deal coffin followed
only by a sobbing old man and a child miserably clad The beadle and
the sacristan very much displeased at being disturbed for so wretched
a funeral had not deigned to put on their liveries but yawning
with impatience waited for the end of the ceremony so useless to the
interests of the establishment At length a few drops of holy water
being sprinkled on the coffin the priest handed the brush to the
beadle and retired

Then took place one of those shameful scenes the necessary consequence
of an ignoble and sacrilegious traffic so frequent with regard to the
burials of the poor who cannot afford to pay for tapers high mass
or violinsfor now St Thomas Aquinas Church has violins even for the
dead

The old man stretched forth his hand to the sacristan to receive the
brush Come look sharp said that official blowing on his fingers

The emotion of the old man was profound and his weakness extreme he
remained for a moment without stirring while the brush was clasped
tightly in his trembling hand In that coffin was his daughter the
mother of the ragged child who wept by his sidehis heart was breaking
at the thought of that last farewell he stood motionless and his bosom
heaved with convulsive sobs

Now will you make haste said the brutal beadle Do you think we are
going to sleep here

The old man quickened his movements He made the sign of the cross over
the corpse and stooping down was about to place the brush in the hand
of his grandson when the sacristan thinking the affair had lasted long
enough snatched the sprinklingbrush from the child and made a sign to
the bearers to carry away the coffinwhich was immediately done

Wasnt that old beggar a slow coach said the beadle to his companion
as they went back to the sacristy We shall hardly have time to get
breakfast and to dress ourselves for the bangup funeral of this
morning That will be something like a dead man thats worth the
trouble I shall shoulder my halberd in style

And mount your colonels epaulets to throw dust in the eyes of the
women that let out the chairseh you old rascal said the other with
a sly look

What can I do Capillare When one has a fine figure it must be seen
answered the beadle with a triumphant air I cannot blind the women to
prevent their losing their hearts

Thus conversing the two men reached the sacristy The sight of the
funeral had only increased the gloom of Frances When she entered the
church seven or eight persons scattered about upon chairs alone
occupied the damp and icy building One of the distributors of holy
water an old fellow with a rubicund joyous winebibbing face seeing
Frances approach the little font said to her in a low voice Abbe
Dubois is not yet in his box Be quick and you will have the first wag
of his beard

Though shocked at this pleasantry Frances thanked the irreverent
speaker made devoutly the sign of the cross advanced some steps into
the church and knelt down upon the stones to repeat the prayer which
she always offered up before approaching the tribunal of penance Having
said this prayer she went towards a dark corner of the church in which
was an oaken confessional with a black curtain drawn across the grated
door The places on each side were vacant so Frances knelt down in that
upon the right hand and remained there for some time absorbed in bitter
reflections

In a few minutes a priest of tall stature with gray hair and a stern
countenance clad in a long black cassock stalked slowly along one of
the aisles of the church A short old misshapen man badly dressed
leaning upon an umbrella accompanied him and from time to time
whispered in his ear when the priest would stop to listen with a
profound and respectful deference

As they approached the confessional the short old man perceiving
Frances on her knees looked at the priest with an air of interrogation
It is she said the clergyman

Well in two or three hours they will expect the two girls at St
Marys Convent I count upon it said the old man

I hope so for the sake of their souls answered the priest and
bowing gravely he entered the confessional The short old man quitted
the church

This old man was Rodin It was on leaving Saint Merelys that he went to
the lunatic asylum to assure himself that Dr Baleinier had faithfully
executed his instructions with regard to Adrienne de Cardoville

Frances was still kneeling in the interior of the confessional One
of the slides opened and a voice began to speak It was that of
the priest who for the last twenty years had been the confessor of
Dagoberts wife and exercised over her an irresistible and allpowerful
influence

You received my letter said the voice

Yes father

Very wellI listen to you

Bless me fatherfor I have sinned said Frances

The voice pronounced the formula of the benediction Dagoberts wife
answered amen as was proper said her confider to It is my fault
gave an account of the manner in which she had performed her last
penance and then proceeded to the enumeration of the new sins
committed since she had received absolution

For this excellent woman a glorious martyr of industry and maternal
love always fancied herself sinning her conscience was incessantly
tormented by the fear that she had committed some incomprehensible
offence This mild and courageous creature who after a whole life
of devotion ought to have passed what time remained to her in calm
serenity of soul looked upon herself as a great sinner and lived in
continual anxiety doubting much her ultimate salvation

Father said Frances in a trembling voice I accuse myself of
omitting my evening prayer the day before yesterday My husband from
whom I had been separated for many years returned home The joy and the
agitation caused by his arrival made me commit this great sin

What next said the voice in a severe tone which redoubled the poor
womans uneasiness

Father I accuse myself of falling into the same sin yesterday evening
I was in a state of mortal anxiety for my son did not come home as
usual and I waited for him minute after minute till the hour had
passed over

What next said the voice

Father I accuse myself of having told a falsehood all this week to
my son by letting him think that on account of his reproaching me for
neglecting my health I had taken a little wine for my dinnerwhereas I
had left it for him who has more need of it because he works so much

Go on said the voice

Father I accuse myself of a momentary want of resignation this
morning when I learned that my poor son was arrested instead of
submitting with respect and gratitude to this new trial which the Lord
hath sent mealas I rebelled against it in my griefand of this I
accuse myself

A bad week said the priest in a tone of still greater severity a
bad weekfor you have always put the creature before the Creator But
proceed

Alas father resumed Frances much dejected I know that I am a
great sinner and I fear that I am on the road to sins of a still graver
kind

Speak

My husband brought with him from Siberia two young orphans daughters
of Marshal Simon Yesterday morning I asked them to say their prayers
and I learned from them with as much fright as sorrow that they know
none of the mysteries of our holy faith though they are fifteen years
old They have never received the sacrament nor are they even baptized
fathernot even baptized

They must be heathens cried the voice in a tone of angry surprise

That is what so much grieves me father for as I and my husband are
in the room of parents to these young orphans we should be guilty of
the sins which they might commitshould we not father

Certainlysince you take the place of those who ought to watch over
their souls The shepherd must answer for his flock said the voice

And if they should happen to be in mortal sin father I and my husband
would be in mortal sin

Yes said the voice you take the place of their parents and fathers
and mothers are guilty of all the sins which their children commit when
those sins arise from the want of a Christian education

Alas father what am I to do I address myself to you as I would to
heaven itself Every day every hour that these poor young girls remain
heathens may contribute to bring about their eternal damnation may it
not father said Frances in a tone of the deepest emotion

Yes answered the voice and the weight of this terrible
responsibility rests upon you and your husband you have the charge of
souls

Lord have mercy upon me said Frances weeping

You must not grieve yourself thus answered the voice in a softer
tone happily for these unfortunates they have met you upon the way
They will have in you and your husband good and pious examplesfor
I suppose that your husband though formerly an ungodly person now
practices his religious duties

We must pray for him father said Frances sorrowfully grace has
not yet touched his heart He is like my poor child who has also not
been called to holiness Ah father said Frances drying her tears
these thoughts are my heaviest cross

So neither your husband nor your son practises resumed the voice
in a tone of reflection this is seriousvery serious The religious
education of these two unfortunate girls has yet to begin In your
house they will have ever before them the most deplorable examples
Take care I have warned you You have the charge of soulsyour
responsibility is immense

Father it is that which makes me wretchedI am at a loss what to do
Help me and give me your counsels for twenty years your voice has been
to me as the voice of the Lord

Well you must agree with your husband to send these unfortunate girls
to some religious house where they may be instructed

We are too poor father to pay for their schooling and unfortunately
my son has just been put in prison for songs that he wrote

Behold the fruit of impiety said the voice severely look at
Gabriel he has followed my counsels and is now the model of every
Christian virtue

My son Agricola has had good qualities father he is so kind so
devoted

Without religion said the voice with redoubled severity what you
call good qualities are only vain appearances at the least breath of
the devil they will disappearfor the devil lurks in every soul that
has no religion

Oh my poor son said Frances weeping I pray for him every day
that faith may enlighten him

I have always told you resumed the voice that you have been too
weak with him God now punishes you for it You should have parted from
this irreligious son and not sanctioned his impiety by loving him
as you do If thy right hand offend thee cut it off saith the
Scripture

Alas father you know it is the only time I have disobeyed you but I
could not bring myself to part from my son

Therefore is your salvation uncertainbut God is merciful Do not fall
into the same fault with regard to these young girls whom Providence
has sent you that you might save them from eternal damnation Do not
plunge them into it by your own culpable indifference

Oh father I have wept and prayed for them

That is not sufficient These unfortunate children cannot have any
notion of good or evil Their souls must be an abyss of scandal and
impuritybrought up as they have been by an impious mother and a
soldier devoid of religion

As for that father said Frances with simplicity they are gentle
as angels and my husband who has not quitted them since their birth
declares they have the best hearts in the world

Your husband has dwelt all his life in mortal sin said the voice
harshly how can he judge of the state of souls I repeat to you that
as you represent the parents of these unfortunates it is not tomorrow
but it is today and on the instant that you must labor for their
salvation if you would not incur a terrible responsibility

It is trueI know it well fatherand I suffer as much from this fear
as from grief at my sons arrest But what is to be done I could not
instruct these young girls at homefor I have not the knowledgeI have
only faithand then my poor husband in his blindness makes game of
sacred things which my son at least respects in my presence out of
regard for me Then once more father come to my aid I conjure you
Advise me what is to be done

We cannot abandon these two young souls to frightful perdition said
the voice after a moments silence there are not two ways of saving
them there is only one and that is to place them in a religious house
where they may be surrounded by good and pious examples

Oh father if we were not so poor or if I could still work I would
try to gain sufficient to pay for their board and do for them as I did
for Gabriel Unfortunately I have quite lost my sight but you father
know some charitable souls and if you could get any of them to interest
them selves for these poor orphans

Where is their father

He was in India but my husband tells me he will soon be in France
That however is uncertain Besides it would make my heart bleed
to see those poor children share our miserywhich will soon be
extremefor we only live by my sons labor

Have these girls no relation here asked the voice

I believe not father

It was their mother who entrusted them to your husband to bring them
to France

Yes father he was obliged to set out yesterday for Chartres on some
very pressing business as he told me

It will be remembered that Dagobert had not thought fit to inform his
wife of the hopes which the daughters of Marshall Simon founded on the
possession of the medal and that he had particularly charged them not
to mention these hopes even to Frances

So resumed the voice after a pause of some moments duration your
husband is not in Paris

No father but he will doubtless return this evening or tomorrow
morning

Listen to me said the voice after another pause Every minute lost
for those two young girls is a new step on the road to perdition At any
moment the hand of God may smite them for He alone knows the hour of
our death and were they to die in the state in which they now are they
would most probably be lost to all eternity This very day therefore
you must open their eyes to the divine light and place them in a
religious house It is your dutyit should be your desire

Oh yes father but unfortunately I am too poor as I have already
told you

I know ityou do not want for zeal or faithbut even were you capable
of directing these young girls the impious examples of your husband and
son would daily destroy your work Others must do for these orphans in
the name of Christian charity that which you cannot do though you are
answerable for them before heaven

Oh father if thanks to you this good work could be accomplished
how grateful I should be

It is not impossible I know the superior of a convent where these
young girls would be instructed as they ought The charge for their
board would be diminished in consideration of their poverty but
however small it must be paid and there would be also an outfit to
furnish All that would be too dear for you

Alas yes father

But by taking a little from my poorbox and by applying to one or two
generous persons I think I shall be able to complete the necessary sum
and so get the young girls received at the convent

Ah father you are my deliverer and these childrens

I wish to be sobut in the interest of their salvation and to make
these measures really efficacious I must attach some conditions to the
support I offer you

Name them father they are accepted beforehand Your commands shall be
obeyed in everything

First of all the children must be taken this very morning to
the convent by my housekeeper to whom you must bring them almost
immediately

Nay father that is impossible cried Frances

Impossible why

In the absence of my husband

Well

I dare not take a such a step without consulting him

Not only must you abstain from consulting him but the thing must be
done during his absence

What father should I not wait for his return

No for two reasons answered the priest sternly first because
his hardened impiety would certainly lead him to oppose your pious
resolution secondly because it is indispensable that these young girls
should break off all connection with your husband who therefore must
be left in ignorance of the place of their retreat

But father said Frances a prey to cruel doubt and embarrassment
it is to my husband that these children were entrustedand to dispose
of them without his consent would be

Can you instruct these children at your houseyes or no interrupted
the voice

No father I cannot

Are they exposed to fall into a state of final impenitence by remaining
with youyes or no

Yes father they are so exposed

Are you responsible as you take the place of their parents for the
mortal sins they may commityes or no

Alas father I am responsible before God

Is it in the interest of their eternal salvation that I enjoin you to
place them this very day in a convent

It is for their salvation father

Well then choose

But tell me I entreat you father if I have the right to dispose of
them without the consent of my husband

The right you have not only the right but it is your sacred duty
Would you not be bound I ask you to rescue these unfortunate creatures
from a fire against the will of your husband or during his absence
Well you must now rescue them not from a fire that will only consume
the body but from one in which their souls would burn to all eternity

Forgive me I implore you father said the poor woman whose
indecision and anguish increased every minute satisfy my doubtsHow
can I act thus when I have sworn obedience to my husband

Obedience for goodyesbut never for evil You confess that were
it left to him the salvation of these orphans would be doubtful and
perhaps impossible

But father said Frances trembling when my husband returns he
will ask me where are these children Must I tell him a falsehood

Silence is not falsehood you will tell him that you cannot answer his
question

My husband is the kindest of men but such an answer will drive him
almost mad He has been a soldier and his anger will be terrible
father said Frances shuddering at the thought

And were his anger a hundred times more terrible you should be proud
to brave it in so sacred a cause cried the voice with indignation
Do you think that salvation is to be so easily gained on earth Since
when does the sinner that would walk in the way of the Lord turn aside
for the stones and briars that may bruise and tear him

Pardon father pardon said Frances with the resignation of despair
Permit me to ask one more question one only Alas if you do not guide
me how shall I find the way

Speak

When Marshal Simon arrives he will ask his children of my husband
What answer can he then give to their father

When Marshal Simon arrives you will let me know immediately and
thenI will see what is to be done The rights of a father are only
sacred in so far as he make use of them for the salvation of his
children Before and above the father on earth is the Father in heaven
whom we must first serve Reflect upon all this By accepting what I
propose to you these young girls will be saved from perdition they
will not be at your charge they will not partake of your misery they
will be brought up in a sacred institution as after all the daughters
of a Marshal of France ought to beand when their father arrives at
Paris if he be found worthy of seeing them again instead of finding
poor ignorant half savage heathens he will behold two girls pious
modest and well informed who being acceptable with the Almighty may
invoke His mercy for their father who it must be owned has great need
of itbeing a man of violence war and battle Now decide Will you
on peril of your soul sacrifice the welfare of these girls in this
world and the next because of an impious dread of your husbands
anger

Though rude and fettered by intolerance the confessors language was
taking his view of the case reasonable and just because the honest
priest was himself convinced of what he said a blind instrument of
Rodin ignorant of the end in view he believed firmly that in forcing
Frances to place these young girls in a convent he was performing a
pious duty Such was and is one of the most wonderful resources of the
order to which Rodin belongedto have for accomplices good and sincere
people who are ignorant of the nature of the plots in which they are
the principal actors

Frances long accustomed to submit to the influence of her confessor
could find nothing to object to his last words She resigned herself to
follow his directions though she trembled to think of the furious anger
of Dagobert when he should no longer find the children that a dying
mother had confided to his care But according to the priests opinion
the more terrible this anger might appear to her the more she would
show her pious humility by exposing herself to it

Gods will be done father said she in reply to her confessor
Whatever may happen I wilt do my duty as a Christianin obedience to
your commands

And the Lord will reward you for what you may have to suffer in the
accomplishment of this meritorious act You promise then before God
that you will not answer any of your husbands questions when he asks
you for the daughters of Marshal Simon

Yes father I promise said Frances with a shudder

And will preserve the same silence towards Marshal Simon himself in
case he should return before his daughters appear to me sufficiently
grounded in the faith to be restored to him

Yes father said Frances in a still fainter voice

You will come and give me an account of the scene that takes place
between you and your husband upon his return

Yes father when must I bring the orphans to your house

In an hour I will write to the superior and leave the letter with my
housekeeper She is a trusty person and will conduct the young girls to
the convent

After she had listened to the exhortations of her confessor and
received absolution for her late sins on condition of performing
penance Dagoberts wife left the confessional

The church was no longer deserted An immense crowd pressed into it
drawn thither by the pomp of the grand funeral of which the beadle
had spoken to the sacristan two hours before It was with the greatest
difficulty that Frances could reach the door of the church now hung
with sumptuous drapery

What a contrast to the poor and humble train which had that morning so
timidly presented themselves beneath the porch

The numerous clergy of the parish in full procession advanced
majestically to receive the coffin covered with a velvet pall the
watered silks and stuffs of their copes and stoles their splendid
silvered embroideries sparkled in the light of a thousand tapers The
beadle strutted in all the glory of his brilliant uniform and flashing
epaulets on the opposite side walked in high glee the sacristan
carrying his whalebone staff with a magisterial air the voice of the
choristers now clad in fresh white surplices rolled out in bursts
of thunder the trumpets blare shook the windows and upon the
countenances of all those who were to have a share in the spoils of this
rich corpse this excellent corpse this firstclass corpse a look
of satisfaction was visible intense and yet subdued which suited
admirably with the air and attitude of the two heirs tall vigorous
fellows with florid complexions who without overstepping the limits
of a charming modesty of enjoyment seemed to cuddle and hug themselves
most comfortably in their mourning cloaks

Notwithstanding her simplicity and pious faith Dagoberts wife was
painfully impressed with this revolting difference between the reception
of the rich and the poor mans coffin at the door of the house of
Godfor surely if equality be ever real it is in the presence of
death and eternity

The two sad spectacles she had witnessed tended still further to
depress the spirits of Frances Having succeeded with no small trouble
in making her way out of the church she hastened to return to the
Rue BriseMiche in order to fetch the orphans and conduct them to the
housekeeper of her confessor who was in her turn to take them to St
Marys Convent situated as we know next door to Dr Baleiniers
lunaticasylum in whichAdrienne de Cardoville was confined




CHAPTER XLIX MY LORD AND SPOILSPORT

The wife of Dagobert having quitted the church arrived at the corner
of the Rue BriseMiche when she was accosted by the distributor of
holy water he came running out of breath to beg her to return to Saint
Merys where the Abbe Dubois had yet something of importance to say to
her

The moment Frances turned to go back a hackneycoach stopped in front
of the house she inhabited The coachman quitted his box to open the
door

Driver said a stout woman dressed in black who was seated in the
carriage and held a pugdog upon her knees ask if Mrs Frances
Baudoin lives in this house

Yes maam said the coachman

The reader will no doubt have recognized Mrs Grivois head
waitingwoman to the Princess de SaintDizier accompanied by My Lord
who exercised a real tyranny over his mistress The dyer whom we have
already seen performing the duties of a porter being questioned by the
coachman as to the dwelling of Frances came out of his workshop and
advanced gallantly to the coachdoor to inform Mrs Grivois that
Frances Baudoin did in fact live in the house but that she was at
present from home

The arms hands and part of the face of Father Loriot were now of
a superb goldcolor The sight of this yellow personage singularly
provoked My Lord and at the moment the dyer rested his hand upon the
edge of the coachwindow the cur began to yelp frightfully and bit him
in the wrist

Oh gracious heaven cried Mrs Grivois in an agony whilst Father
Loriot withdrew his hand with precipitation I hope there is nothing
poisonous in the dye that you have about youmy dog is so delicate

So saying she carefully wiped the pugnose spotted with yellow Father
Loriot not at all satisfied with this speech when he had expected to
receive some apology from Mrs Grivois on account of her dogs behavior
said to her as with difficulty he restrained his anger If you did not
belong to the fair sex which obliges me to respect you in the person
of that wretched animal I would have the pleasure of taking him by the
tail and making him in one minute a dog of the brightest orange color
by plunging him into my cauldron which is already on the fire

Dye my pet yellow cried Mrs Grivois in great wrath as she
descended from the hackneycoach clasping My Lord tenderly to her
bosom and surveying Father Loriot with a savage look

I told you Mrs Baudoin is not at home said the dyer as he saw the
pugdogs mistress advance in the direction of the dark staircase

Never mind I will wait for her said Mrs Grivois tartly On which
story does she live

Up four pair answered Father Loriot returning abruptly to his shop
And he added to himself with a chuckle at the anticipation I hope
Father Dagoberts big prowler will be in a bad humor and give that
villainous pug a shaking by the skin of his neck

Mrs Grivois mounted the steep staircase with some difficulty stopping
at every landingplace to take breath and looking about her with
profound disgust At length she reached the fourth story and paused an
instant at the door of the humble chamber in which the two sisters and
Mother Bunch then were

The young sempstress was occupied in collecting the different articles
that she was about to carry to the pawnbrokers Rose and Blanche seemed
happier and somewhat less uneasy about the future for they had learned
from Mother Bunch that when they knew how to sew they might between
them earn eight francs a week which would at least afford some
assistance to the family

The presence of Mrs Grivois in Baudoins dwelling was occasioned by a
new resolution of Abbe dAigrigny and the Princess de SaintDizier they
had thought it more prudent to send Mrs Grivois on whom they could
blindly depend to fetch the young girls and the confessor was charged
to inform Frances that it was not to his housekeeper but to a lady
that would call on her with a note from him that she was to deliver the
orphans to be taken to a religious establishment

Having knocked at the door the waitingwoman of the Princess de Saint
Dizier entered the room and asked for Frances Baudoin

She is not at home madame said Mother Bunch timidly not a little
astonished at so unexpected a visit and casting down her eyes before
the gaze of this woman

Then I will wait for her as I have important affairs to speak of
answered Mrs Grivois examining with curiosity and attention the
faces of the two orphans who also cast down their eyes with an air of
confusion

So saying Madame Grivois sat down not without some repugnance in the
old armchair of Dagoberts wife and believing that she might now
leave her favorite at liberty she laid him carefully on the floor
Immediately a low growl deep and hollow sounding from behind the
armchair made Mrs Grivois jump from her seat and sent the pugdog
yelping with affright and trembling through his fat to take refuge
close to his mistress with all the symptoms of angry alarm

What is there a dog here cried Mrs Grivois stooping precipitately
to catch up My Lord whilst as if he wished himself to answer
the question Spoilsport rose leisurely from his place behind the
armchair and appeared suddenly yawning and stretching himself

At sight of this powerful animal with his double row of formidable
pointed fangs which he seemed to take delight in displaying as he
opened his large jaws Mrs Grivois could not help giving utterance to
a cry of terror The snappish pug had at first trembled in all his limbs
at the Siberians approach but finding himself in safety on the lap
of his mistress he began to growl insolently and to throw the most
provoking glances at Spoilsport These the worthy companion of the
deceased Jovial answered disdainfully by gaping anew after which he
went smelling round Mrs Grivois with a sort of uneasiness turned
his back upon My Lord and stretched himself at the feet of Rose and
Blanche keeping his large intelligent eyes fixed upon them as if he
foresaw that they were menaced with some danger

Turn out that beast said Mrs Grivois imperiously he frightens my
dog and may do him some harm

Do not be afraid madame replied Rose with a smile Spoilsport
will do no harm if he is not attacked

Never mind cried Mrs Grivois an accident soon happens The very
sight of that enormous dog with his wolfs head and terrible teeth is
enough to make one tremble at the injuries he might do one I tell you
to turn him out

Mrs Grivois had pronounced these last words in a tone of irritation
which did not sound at all satisfactory in Spoilsports ears so he
growled and showed his teeth turning his head in the direction of the
stranger

Be quiet Spoilsport said Blanche sternly

A new personage here entered the room and put an end to this situation
which was embarrassing enough for the two young girls It was a
commissionaire with a letter in his hand

What is it sir asked Mother Bunch

A very pressing letter from the good man of the house the dyer below
stairs told me to bring it up here

A letter from Dagobert cried Rose and Blanche with a lively
expression of pleasure He is returned then where is he

I do not know whether the good man is called Dagobert or not said
the porter but he is an old trooper with a gray moustache and may be
found close by at the office of the Chartres coaches

That is he cried Blanche Give me the letter

The porter handed it to the young girl who opened it in all haste

Mrs Grivois was struck dumb with dismay she knew that Dagobert had
been decoyed from Paris that the Abbe Dubois might have an opportunity
to act with safety upon Frances Hitherto all had succeeded the good
woman had consented to place the young girls in the hands of a religious
communityand now arrives this soldier who was thought to be absent
from Paris for two or three days at least and whose sudden return might
easily ruin this laborious machination at the moment when it seemed to
promise success

Oh said Blanche when she had read the letter What a misfortune

What is it then sister cried Rose

Yesterday half way to Chartres Dagobert perceived that he had lost
his purse He was unable to continue his journey he took a place upon
credit to return and he asks his wife to send him some money to the
office to pay what he owes

Thats it said the porter for the good man told me to make haste
because he was there in pledge

And nothing in the house cried Blanche Dear me what is to be
done

At these words Mrs Grivois felt her hopes revive for a moment they
were soon however dispelled by Mother Bunch who exclaimed as she
pointed to the parcel she had just made up Be satisfied dear young
ladies here is a resource The pawnbrokers to which I am going is
not far off and I will take the money direct to M Dagobert in half an
hour at latest he will be here

Oh my dear friend you are right said Rose How good you are you
think of everything

And here said Blanche is the letter with the address upon it Take
that with you

Thank you answered Mother Bunch then addressing the porter she
added Return to the person who sent you and tell him I shall be at
the coachoffice very shortly

Infernal hunchback thought Mrs Grivois with suppressed rage she
thinks of everything Without her we should have escaped the plague of
this mans return What is to be done now The girls would not go with
me before the arrival of the soldiers wife to propose it to them
would expose me to a refusal and might compromise all Once more what
is to be done

Do not be uneasy ladies said the porter as he went out I will
go and assure the good man that he will not have to remain long in
pledge

Whilst Mother Bunch was occupied in tying her parcel in which she had
placed the silver cup fork and spoon Mrs Grivois seemed to reflect
deeply Suddenly she started Her countenance which had been for some
moments expressive of anxiety and rage brightened up on the instant
She rose still holding My Lord in her arms and said to the young
girls As Mrs Baudoin does not come in I am going to pay a visit in
the neighborhood and will return immediately Pray tell her so

With these words Mr Grivois took her departure a few minutes before
Mother Bunch left




CHAPTER L APPEARANCES

After she had again endeavored to cheer up the orphans the sewinggirl
descended the stairs not without difficulty for in addition to the
parcel which was already heavy she had fetched down from her own room
the only blanket she possessedthus leaving herself without protection
from the cold of her icy garret

The evening before tortured with anxiety as to Agricolas fate the
girl had been unable to work the miseries of expectation and hope
delayed had prevented her from doing so now another day would be lost
and yet it was necessary to live Those overwhelming sorrows which
deprive the poor of the faculty of labor are doubly dreaded they
paralyze the strength and with that forced cessation from toil want
and destitution are often added to grief

But Mother Bunch that complete incarnation of holiest duty had yet
strength enough to devote herself for the service of others Some of the
most frail and feeble creatures are endowed with extraordinary vigor
of soul it would seem as if in these weak infirm organizations the
spirit reigned absolutely over the body and knew how to inspire it with
a factitious energy

Thus for the last twentyfour hours Mother Bunch had neither slept
nor eaten she had suffered from the cold through the whole of a frosty
night In the morning she had endured great fatigue in going amid rain
and snow to the Rue de Babylone and back twice crossing Paris and yet
her strength was not exhaustedso immense is the power of the human
heart

She had just arrived at the corner of the Rue Saint Mery Since the
recent Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy there were stationed in this
populous quarter of the town a much larger number of policeofficers
than usual Now the young sempstress though bending beneath the weight
of her parcel had quickened her pace almost to a run when just as she
passed in front of one of the police two fivefranc pieces fell on the
ground behind her thrown there by a stout woman in black who followed
her closely

Immediately after the stout woman pointed out the two pieces to the
policeman and said something hastily to him with regard to Mother
Bunch Then she withdrew at all speed in the direction of the Rue
BriseMiche

The policeman struck with what Mrs Grivois had said to him  for it
was that person picked up the money and running after the humpback
cried out to her Hi there young woman I saystop stop

On this outcry several persons turned round suddenly and as always
happens in those quarters of the town a nucleus of five or six persons
soon grew to a considerable crowd

Not knowing that the policeman was calling to her Mother Bunch only
quickened her speed wishing to get to the pawnbrokers as soon as
possible and trying to avoid touching any of the passersby so much
did she dread the brutal and cruel railleries to which her infirmity so
often exposed her

Suddenly she heard many persons running after her and at the same
instant a hand was laid rudely on her shoulder It was the policeman
followed by another officer who had been drawn to the spot by the
noise Mother Bunch turned round struck with as much surprise as fear

She found herself in the centre of a crowd composed chiefly of that
hideous scum idle and in rags insolent and malicious besotted with
ignorance brutalized by want and always loafing about the corners
Workmen are scarcely ever met with in these mobs for they are for the
most part engaged in their daily labors

Come cant you hear you are deaf as Punchs dog said the policeman
seizing Mother Bunch so rudely by the arm that she let her parcel fall
at her feet

When the unfortunate girl looking round in terror saw herself exposed
to all those insolent mocking malicious glances when she beheld the
cynical and coarse grimace on so many ignoble and filthy countenances
she trembled in all her limbs and became fearfully pale No doubt the
policeman had spoken roughly to her but how could he speak otherwise to
a poor deformed girl pale and trembling with her features agitated
by grief and fearto a wretched creature miserably clad who wore
in winter a thin cotton gown soiled with mud and wet with melted
snowfor the poor sempstress had walked much and far that morning So
the policeman resumed with great severity following that supreme law
of appearances which makes poverty always suspected Stop a bit
young woman it seems you are in a mighty hurry to let your money fall
without picking it up

Was her blunt hid in her hump said the hoarse voice of a matchboy a
hideous and repulsive specimen of precocious depravity

This sally was received with laughter shouts and hooting which served
to complete the sewinggirls dismay and terror She was hardly able to
answer in a feeble voice as the policeman handed her the two pieces of
silver This money sir is not mine

You lie said the other officer approaching a respectable lady saw
it drop from your pocket

I assure you sir it is not so answered Mother Bunch trembling

I tell you that you lie resumed the officer for the lady struck
with your guilty and frightened air said to me Look at yonder little
hunchback running away with that large parcel and letting her money
fall without even stopping to pick it upit is not natural

Bobby resumed the matchvendor in his hoarse voice be on your
guard Feel her hump for that is her luggagevan Im sure that youll
find boots and cloaks and umbrellas and clocks in itfor I just
heard the hour strike in the bend of her back

Then came fresh bursts of laughter and shouts and hooting for this
horrible mob has no pity for those who implore and suffer The crowd
increased more and more and now they indulged in hoarse cries piercing
whistles and all kinds of horse play

Let a fellow see her its free gratis

Dont push so Ive paid for my place

Make her stand up on something that all may have a look

My corns are being ground it was not worth coming

Show her properlyor return the money

Thats fair aint it

Give it us in the garden style

Trot her out in all her paces Kim up

Fancy the feelings of this unfortunate creature with her delicate
mind good heart and lofty soul and yet with so timid and nervous a
character as she stood alone with the two policemen in the thick of the
crowd and was forced to listen to all these coarse and savage insults

But the young sempstress did not yet understand of what crime she was
accused She soon discovered it however for the policeman seizing the
parcel which she had picked up and now held in her trembling hands said
to her rudely What is there in that bundle

Sirit isI am going The unfortunate girl hesitatedunable in
her terror to find the word

If thats all you have to answer said the policeman its no great
shakes Come make haste turn your bundle inside out

So saying the policeman snatched the parcel from her half opened it
and repeated as he enumerated the divers articles it contained
The devilsheetsa spoon and forka silver muga shawla
blanketyoure a downy mot it was not so bad a move Dressed like a
beggar and with silver plate about you Oh yes youre a deep un

Those articles do not belong to you said the other officer

No sir replied Mother Bunch whose strength was failing her but

Oh vile hunchback you have stolen more than you are big

Stolen cried Mother Bunch clasping her hands in horror for she now
understood it all Stolen

The guard make way for the lobsters cried several persons at once

Oh ho heres the lobsters

The fireeaters

The Arab devourers

Come for their dromedary

In the midst of these noisy jests two soldiers and a corporal advanced
with much difficulty Their bayonets and the barrels of their guns were
alone visible above the heads of this hideous and compact crowd Some
officious person had been to inform the officer at the nearest guard
house that a considerable crowd obstructed the public way

Come here is the guardso march to the guardhouse said the
policeman taking Mother Bunch by the arm

Sir said the poor girl in a voice stifled by sobs clasping her
hands in terror and sinking upon her knees on the pavement sirhave
pitylet me explain

You will explain at the guardhouse so come on

But sirI am not a thief cried Mother Bunch in a heartrending
tone have pity upon medo not take me away like a thief before all
this crowd Oh mercy mercy

I tell you there will be time to explain at the guardhouse The
street is blocked up so come along Grasping the unfortunate creature
by both her hands he set her as it were on her feet again

At this instant the corporal and his two soldiers having succeeded
in making their way through the crowd approached the policeman
Corporal said the latter take this girl to the guardhouse I am an
officer of the police

Oh gentlemen cried the girl weeping hot tears and wringing her
hands do not take me away before you let me explain myself I am not
a thiefindeed indeed I am not a thief I will tell youit was to
render service to othersonly let me tell you

I tell you you should give your explanations at the guardhouse if
you will not walk we must drag you along said the policeman

We must renounce the attempt to paint this scene at once ignoble and
terrible

Weak overpowered filled with alarm the unfortunate girl was dragged
along by the soldiers her knees sinking under her at every step
The two policeofficers had each to lend an arm to support her and
mechanically she accepted their assistance Then the vociferations and
hootings burst forth with redoubled fury Halfswooning between the two
men the hapless creature seemed to drain the cup of bitterness to the
dregs

Beneath that foggy sky in that dirty street under the shadow of the
tall black houses those hideous masses of people reminded one of the
wildest fancies of Callot and of Goya children in rags drunken women
grim and blighted figures of men rushed against each other pushed
fought struggled to follow with howls and hisses an almost inanimate
victimthe victim of a deplorable mistake

Of a mistake How one shudders to think that such arrests may often
take place founded upon nothing but the suspicion caused by the
appearance of misery or by some inaccurate description Can we forget
the case of that young girl who wrongfully accused of participating
in a shameful traffic found means to escape from the persons who were
leading her to prison and rushing up the stairs of a house threw
herself from a window in her despair and was crushed to death upon the
pavingstones

Meanwhile after the abominable denunciation of which Mother Bunch was
the victim Mrs Grivois had returned precipitately to the Rue Brise
Miche She ascended in haste to the fourth story opened the door of
Frances Baudoins room and sawDagobert in company with his wife and
the two orphans




CHAPTER LI THE CONVENT

Let us explain in a few words the presence of Dagobert His countenance
was impressed with such an air of military frankness that the manager
of the coachoffice would have been satisfied with his promise to return
and pay the money but the soldier had obstinately insisted on remaining
in pledge as he called it till his wife had answered his letter
When however on the return of the porter he found that the money was
coming his scruples were satisfied and he hastened to run home

We may imagine the stupor of Mrs Grivois when upon entering the
chamber she perceived Dagobert whom she easily recognized by the
description she had heard of him seated beside his wife and the
orphans The anxiety of Frances at sight of Mrs Grivois was equally
striking Rose and Blanche had told her of the visit of a lady during
her absence upon important business and judging by the information
received from her confessor Frances had no doubt that this was the
person charged to conduct the orphans to a religious establishment

Her anxiety was terrible Resolved to follow the counsels of Abbe
Dubois she dreaded lest a word from Mrs Grivois should put Dagobert on
the scentin which case all would be lost and the orphans would
remain in their present state of ignorance and mortal sin for which she
believed herself responsible

Dagobert who held the hands of Rose and Blanche left his seat as the
Princess de SaintDiziers waitingwoman entered the room and cast an
inquiring glance on Frances

The moment was criticalnay decisive but Mrs Grivois had profited by
the example of the Princess de SaintDizier So taking her resolution
at once and turning to account the precipitation with which she had
mounted the stairs after the odious charge she had brought against poor
Mother Bunch and even the emotion caused by the unexpected sight of
Dagobert which gave to her features an expression of uneasiness and
alarmshe exclaimed in an agitated voice after the moments silence
necessary to collect her thoughts Oh madame I have just been the
spectator of a great misfortune Excuse my agitation but I am so
excited

Dear me what is the matter said Frances in a trembling voice for
she dreaded every moment some indiscretion on the part of Mrs Grivois

I called just now resumed the other to speak to you on some
important business whilst I was waiting for you a poor young woman
rather deformed put up sundry articles in a parcel

Yes said Frances it was Mother Bunch an excellent worthy
creature

I thought as much madame well you shall hear what has happened As
you did not come in I resolved to pay a visit in the neighborhood I go
out and get as far as the Rue St Mery whenOh madame

Well said Dagobert what then

I see a crowdI inquire what is the matterI learn that a policeman
has just arrested a young girl as a thief because she had been seen
carrying a bundle composed of different articles which did not appear
to belong to herI approachedwhat do I beholdthe same young woman
that I had met just before in this room

Oh the poor child exclaimed Frances growing pale and clasping her
hands together What a dreadful thing

Explain then said Dagobert to his wife What was in this bundle

Well my dearto confess the truthI was a little short and I asked
our poor friend to take some things for me to the pawnbrokers

What and they thought she had robbed us cried Dagobert she
the most honest girl in the world it is dreadfulyou ought to have
interfered madame you ought to have said that you knew her

I tried to do so sir but unfortunately they would not hear me The
crowd increased every moment till the guard came up and carried her
off

She might die of it she is so sensitive and timid exclaimed Frances

Ah good Mother Bunch so gentle so considerate said Blanche
turning with tearful eyes towards her sister

Not being able to help her resumed Mrs Grivois I hastened hither
to inform you of this misadventurewhich may indeed easily be
repairedas it will only be necessary to go and claim the young girl as
soon as possible

At these words Dagobert hastily seized his hat and said abruptly to
Mrs Grivois Zounds madame you should have begun by telling us that
Where is the poor child Do you know

I do not sir but there are still so many excited people in the street
that if you will have the kindness to step out you will be sure to
learn

Why the devil do you talk of kindness It is my duty madame Poor
child repeated Dagobert Taken up as a thiefit is really horrible
I will go to the guardhouse and to the commissary of police for this
neighborhood and by hook or crook I will find her and have her out
and bring her home with me

So saying Dagobert hastily departed Frances now that she felt more
tranquil as to the fate of Mother Bunch thanked the Lord that this
circumstance had obliged her husband to go out for his presence at this
juncture caused her a terrible embarrassment

Mrs Grivois had left My Lord in the coach below for the moments were
precious Casting a significant glance at Frances she handed her Abbe
Dubois letter and said to her with strong emphasis on every word
You will see by this letter madame what was the object of my visit
which I have not before been able to explain to you but on which I
truly congratulate myself as it brings me into connection with these
two charming young ladies Rose and Blanche looked at each other in
surprise Frances took the letter with a trembling hand It required all
the pressing and threatening injunctions of her confessor to conquer
the last scruples of the poor woman for she shuddered at the thought of
Dagoberts terrible indignation Moreover in her simplicity she knew
not how to announce to the young girls that they were to accompany this
lady

Mrs Grivois guessed her embarrassment made a sign to her to be at her
ease and said to Rose whilst Frances was reading the letter of her
confessor How happy your relation will be to see you my dear young
lady

Our relation madame said Rose more and more astonished

Certainly She knew of your arrival here but as she is still
suffering from the effects of a long illness she was not able to come
herself today and has sent me to fetch you to her Unfortunately
added Mrs Grivois perceiving a movement of uneasiness on the part of
the two sisters it will not be in her power as she tells Mrs Baudoin
in her letter to see you for more than a very short timeso you may
be back here in about an hour But tomorrow or the next day after
she will be well enough to leave home and then she will come and make
arrangements with Mrs Baudoin and her husband to take you into her
housefor she could not bear to leave you at the charge of the worthy
people who have been so kind to you

These last words of Mrs Grivois made a favorable impression upon the
two sisters and banished their fears of becoming a heavy burden to
Dagoberts family If it had been proposed to them to quit altogether
the house in the Rue BrisMiche without first asking the consent of
their old friend they would certainly have hesitated but Mrs Grivois
had only spoken of an hours visit They felt no suspicion therefore
and Rose said to Frances We may go and see our relation I suppose
madame without waiting for Dagoberts return

Certainly said Frances in a feeble voice since you are to be back
almost directly

Then madame I would beg these dear young ladies to come with me as
soon as possible as I should like to bring them back before noon

We are ready madame said Rose

Well then young ladies embrace your second mother and come said
Mrs Grivois who was hardly able to control her uneasiness for she
trembled lest Dagobert should return from one moment to the other

Rose and Blanche embraced Frances who clasping in her arms the two
charming and innocent creatures that she was about to deliver up could
with difficulty restrain her tears though she was fully convinced that
she was acting for their salvation

Come young ladies said Mrs Grivois in the most affable tone let
us make hasteyou will excuse my impatience I am surebut it is in
the name of your relation that I speak

Having once more tenderly kissed the wife of Dagobert the sisters
quitted the room hand in hand and descended the staircase close
behind Mrs Grivois followed without their being aware of it by
Spoilsport The intelligent animal cautiously watched their movements
for in the absence of his master he never let them out of his sight

For greater security no doubt the waitingwoman of Madame de Saint
Dizier had ordered the hackneycoach to wait for her at a little
distance from the Rue BriseMiche in the cloister square In a few
seconds the orphans and their conductress reached the carriage

Oh missus said the coachman opening the door no offence I
hopebut you have the most illtempered rascal of a dog Since you put
him into my coach he has never ceased howling like a roasted cat
and looks as if he would eat us all up alive In fact My Lord who
detested solitude was yelling in the most deplorable manner

Be quiet My Lord here I am said Mrs Grivois then addressing the
two sisters she added Pray get in my dear young ladies

Rose and Blanche got into the coach Before she followed them Mrs
Grivois was giving to the coachman in a low voice the direction to St
Marys Convent and was adding other instructions when suddenly the pug
dog who had growled savagely when the sisters took their seats in
the coach began to bark with fury The cause of this anger was clear
enough Spoilsport until now unperceived had with one bound entered
the carriage

The pug exasperated by this boldness forgetting his ordinary prudence
and excited to the utmost by rage and ugliness of temper sprang at his
muzzle and bit him so cruelly that in his turn the brave Siberian
dog maddened by the pain threw himself upon the teaser seized him
by the throat and fairly strangled him with two grips of his powerful
jawsas appeared by one stifled groan of the pug previously half
suffocated with fat

All this took place in less time than is occupied by the description
Rose and Blanche had hardly opportunity to exclaim twice Here Spoil
sport down

Oh good gracious said Mrs Grivois turning round at the noise
There again is that monster of a doghe will certainly hurt my love
Send him away young ladiesmake him get downit is impossible to take
him with us

Ignorant of the degree of Spoilsports criminality for his paltry foe
was stretched lifeless under a seat the young girls yet felt that it
would be improper to take the dog with them and they therefore said to
him in an angry tone at the same time slightly touching him with their
feet Get down Spoilsport go away

The faithful animal hesitated at first to obey this order Sad and
supplicatingly looked he at the orphans and with an air of mild
reproach as if blaming them for sending away their only defender But
upon the stern repetition of the command he got down from the coach
with his tail between his legs feeling perhaps that he had been
somewhat overhasty with regard to the pug

Mrs Grivois who was in a great hurry to leave that quarter of the
town seated herself with precipitation in the carriage the coachman
closed the door and mounted his box and then the coach started at a
rapid rate whilst Mrs Grivois prudently let down the blinds for fear
of meeting Dagobert by the way

Having taken these indispensable precautions she was able to turn her
attention to her pet whom she loved with all that deep exaggerated
affection which people of a bad disposition sometimes entertain for
animals as if then concentrated and lavished upon them all those
feelings in which they are deficient with regard to their fellow
creatures In a word Mrs Grivois was passionately attached to this
peevish cowardly spiteful dog partly perhaps from a secret sympathy
with his vices This attachment had lasted for six years and only
seemed to increase as My Lord advanced in age

We have laid some stress on this apparently puerile detail because the
most trifling causes have often disastrous effects and because we wish
the reader to understand what must have been the despair fury and
exasperation of this woman when she discovered the death of her doga
despair a fury and an exasperation of which the orphans might yet
feel the cruel consequences

The hackneycoach had proceeded rapidly for some seconds when Mrs
Grivois who was seated with her back to the horses called My Lord The
dog had very good reasons for not replying

Well you sulky beauty said Mrs Grivois soothingly you have taken
offence have you It was not my fault if that great ugly dog came into
the coach was it young ladies Come and kiss your mistress and let us
make peace old obstinate

The same obstinate silence continued on the part of the canine noble
Rose and Blanche began to look anxiously at each other for they knew
that Spoilsport was somewhat rough in his ways though they were far
from suspecting what had really happened But Mrs Grivois rather
surprised than uneasy at her puglogs insensibility to her affectionate
appeals and believing him to be sullenly crouching beneath the seat
stooped clown to take him up and feeling one of his paws drew it
impatiently towards her whilst she said to him in a halfjesting half
angry tone Come naughty fellow you will give a pretty notion of your
temper to these young ladies

So saying she took up the dog much astonished at his unresisting
torpor but what was her fright when having placed him upon her lap
she saw that he was quite motionless

An apoplexy cried she The dear creature ate too muchI was always
afraid of it

Turning round hastily she exclaimed Stop coachman stop without
reflecting that the coachman could not hear her Then raising the curs
head still thinking that he was only in a fit she perceived with
horror the bloody holes imprinted by five or six sharp fangs which left
no doubt of the cause of his deplorable end

Her first impulse was one of grief and despair Dead she exclaimed
dead and already cold Oh goodness And this woman burst into tears

The tears of the wicked are ominous For a bad man to weep he must
have suffered much and with him the reaction of suffering instead of
softening the soul inflames it to a dangerous anger

Thus after yielding to that first painful emotion the mistress of My
Lord felt herself transported with rage and hateyes hateviolent
hate for the young girls who had been the involuntary cause of the
dogs death Her countenance so plainly betrayed her resentment that
Blanche and Rose were frightened at the expression of her face which
had now grown purple with fury as with agitated voice and wrathful
glance she exclaimed It was your dog that killed him

Oh madame said Rose we had nothing to do with it

It was your dog that bit Spoilsport first added Blanche in a
plaintive voice

The look of terror impressed on the features of the orphans recalled
Mrs Grivois to herself She saw the fatal consequences that might arise
from yielding imprudently to her anger For the very sake of vengeance
she had to restrain herself in order not to awaken suspicion in the
minds of Marshal Simons daughters But not to appear to recover too
soon from her first impression she continued for some minutes to cast
irritated glances at the young girls then little by little her anger
seemed to give way to violent grief she covered her face with her
hands heaved a long sigh and appeared to weep bitterly

Poor lady whispered Rose to Blanche How she weepsNo doubt she
loved her dog as much as we love Spoilsport

Alas yes replied Blanche We also wept when our old Jovial was
killed

After a few minutes Mrs Grivois raised her head dried her eyes
definitively and said in a gentle and almost affectionate voice
Forgive me young ladies I was unable to repress the first movement
of irritation or rather of deep sorrowfor I was tenderly attached to
this poor dog he has never left me for six years

We are very sorry for this misfortune madame resumed Rose and we
regret it the more that it seems to be irreparable

I was just saying to my sister that we can the better fancy your
grief as we have had to mourn the death of our old horse that carried
us all the way from Siberia

Well my dear young ladies let us think no more about it It was
my fault I should not have brought him with me but he was always so
miserable whenever I left him You will make allowance for my weakness
A good heart feels for animals as well as people so I must trust to
your sensibility to excuse my hastiness

Do not think of it madame it is only your grief that afflicts us

I shall get over it my dear young ladiesI shall get over it The joy
of the meeting between you and your relation will help to console
me She will be so happy You are so charming and then the singular
circumstance of your exact likeness to each other adds to the interest
you inspire

You are too kind to us madame

Oh noI am sure you resemble each other as much in disposition as in
face

That is quite natural madame said Rose for since our birth we have
never left each other a minute whether by night or day It would be
strange if we were not like in character

Really my dear young ladies you have never left each other a minute

Never madame The sisters joined hands with an expressive smile

Then how unhappy you would be and how much to be pitied if ever you
were separated

Oh madame it is impossible said Blanche smiling

How impossible

Who would have the heart to separate us

No doubt my dear young ladies it would be very cruel

Oh madame resumed Blanche even very wicked people would not think
of separating us

So much the better my dear young ladiespray why

Because it would cause us too much grief

Because it would kill us

Poor little dears

Three months ago we were shut up in prison Well when the governor of
the prison saw us though he looked a very stern man he could not help
saying It would be killing these children to separate them and so we
remained together and were as happy as one can be in prison

It shows your excellent heart and also that of the persons who knew
how to appreciate it

The carriage stopped and they heard the coachman call out Any one at
the gate there

Oh here we are at your relations said Mrs Grivois Two wings of a
gate flew open and the carriage rolled over the gravel of a courtyard

Mrs Grivois having drawn up one of the blinds they found themselves in
a vast court across the centre of which ran a high wall with a kind
of porch upon columns under which was a little door Behind this wall
they could see the upper part of a very large building in freestone
Compared with the house in the Rue BriseMiche this building appeared
a palace so Blanche said to Mrs Grivois with an expression of artless
admiration Dear me madame what a fine residence

That is nothing replied Madame Grivois wait till you see the
interior which is much finer

When the coachman opened the door of the carriage what was the rage of
Mrs Grivois and the surprise of the girls to see Spoilsport who
had been clever enough to follow the coach Pricking up his ears and
wagging his tail he seemed to have forgotten his late offences and to
expect to be praised for his intelligent fidelity

What cried Mrs Grivois whose sorrows were renewed at the sight
has that abominable dog followed the coach

A famous dog mum answered the coachman he never once left the heels
of my horses He must have been trained to it Hes a powerful beast
and two men couldnt scare him Look at the throat of him now

The mistress of the deceased pug enraged at the somewhat unseasonable
praises bestowed upon the Siberian said to the orphans I will
announce your arrival wait for me an instant in the coach

So saying she went with a rapid step towards the porch and rang the
bell A woman clad in a monastic garb appeared at the door and bowed
respectfully to Mrs Grivois who addressed her in these few words I
have brought you the two young girls the orders of Abbe dAigrigny and
the princess are that they be instantly separated and kept apart in
solitary cellsyou understand sisterand subjected to the rule for
impenitents

I will go and inform the superior and it will be done said the
portress with another bend

Now will you come my dear young ladies resumed Mrs Grivois
addressing the two girls who had secretly bestowed a few caresses upon
Spoil sport so deeply were they touched by his instinctive attachment
you will be introduced to your relation and I will return and fetch
you in half an hour Coachman keep that dog back

Rose and Blanche in getting out of the coach were so much occupied
with Spoilsport that they did not perceive the portress who was half
hidden behind the little door Neither did they remark that the person
who was to introduce them was dressed as a nun till taking them by
the hand she had led them across the threshold when the door was
immediately closed behind them

As soon as Mrs Grivois had seen the orphans safe into the convent she
told the coachman to leave the courtyard and wait for her at the
outer gate The coachman obeyed but Spoilsport who had seen Rose and
Blanche enter by the little door ran to it and remained there

Mrs Grivois then called the porter of the main entrance a tall
vigorous fellow and said to him Here are ten francs for you Nicholas
if you will beat out the brains of that great dog who is crouching
under the porch

Nicholas shook his head as he observed Spoilsports size and strength
Devil take me madame said he tis not so easy to tackle a dog of
that build

I will give you twenty francs only kill him before me

One ought to have a gun and I have only an iron hammer

That will do you can knock him down at a blow

Well madameI will trybut I have my doubts And Nicholas went to
fetch his mallet

Oh if I had the strength said Mrs Grivois

The porter returned with his weapon and advanced slowly and
treacherously towards Spoilsport who was still crouching beneath the
porch Here old fellow here my good dog said Nicholas striking
his left hand on his thigh and keeping his right behind him with the
crowbar grasped in it

Spoilsport rose examined Nicholas attentively and no doubt perceiving
by his manner that the porter meditated some evil design bounded away
from him outflanked the enemy saw clearly what was intended and kept
himself at a respectful distance

He smells a rat said Nicholas the rascals on his guard He will
not let me come near him Its no go

You are an awkward fellow said Mrs Grivois in a passion as she
threw a fivefranc piece to Nicholas at all events drive him away

That will be easier than to kill him madame said the porter Indeed
finding himself pursued and conscious probably that it would be useless
to attempt an open resistance Spoilsport fled from the courtyard into
the street but once there he felt himself as it were upon neutral
ground and notwithstanding all the threats of Nicholas refused to
withdraw an inch further than just sufficient to keep out of reach of
the sledgehammer So that when Mrs Grivois pale with rage again
stepped into her hackneycoach in which were My Lords lifeless
remains she saw with the utmost vexation that Spoilsport was lying at
a few steps from the gate which Nicholas had just closed having given
up the chase in despair

The Siberian dog sure of finding his way back to the Rue BriseMiche
had determined with the sagacity peculiar to his race to wait for the
orphans on the spot where he then was

Thus were the two sisters confined in St Marys Convent which as we
have already said was next door to the lunatic asylum in which Adrienne
de Cardoville was immured

We now conduct the reader to the dwelling of Dagoberts wife who was
waiting with dreadful anxiety for the return of her husband knowing
that he would call her to account for the disappearance of Marshal
Simons daughters




CHAPTER LII THE INFLUENCE OF A CONFESSOR

Hardly had the orphans quitted Dagoberts wife when the poor woman
kneeling down began to pray with fervor Her tears long restrained
now flowed abundantly notwithstanding her sincere conviction that she
had performed a religious duty in delivering up the girls she waited
with extreme fear her husbands return Though blinded by her pious
zeal she could not hide from herself that Dagobert would have good
reason to be angry and then this poor mother had also under these
untoward circumstances to tell him of Agricolas arrest

Every noise upon the stairs made Frances start with trembling anxiety
after which she would resume her fervent prayers supplicating strength
to support this new and arduous trial At length she heard a step
upon the landingplace below and feeling sure this time that it was
Dagobert she hastily seated herself dried her tears and taking a
sack of coarse cloth upon her lap appeared to be occupied with
sewingthough her aged hands trembled so much that she could hardly
hold the needle

After some minutes the door opened and Dagobert appeared The soldiers
rough countenance was stern and sad as he entered he flung his hat
violently upon the table so full of painful thought that he did not at
first perceive the absence of the orphans

Poor girl cried he It is really terrible

Didst see Mother Bunch didst claim her said Frances hastily
forgetting for a moment her own fears

Yes I have seen herbut in what a statetwas enough to break ones
heart I claimed her and pretty loud too I can tell you but they said
to me that the commissary must first come to our place in order
here Dagobert paused threw a glance of surprise round the room and
exclaimed abruptly Where are the children

Frances felt herself seized with an icy shudder My dear she began in
a feeble voicebut she was unable to continue

Where are Rose and Blanche Answer me then And Spoilsport who is not
here either

Do not be angry

Come said Dagobert abruptly I see you have let them go out with a
neighborwhy not have accompanied them yourself or let them wait for
me if they wished to take a walk which is natural enough this room
being so dull But I am astonished that they should have gone out before
they had news of good Mother Bunchthey have such kind hearts But how
pale you are added the soldier looking nearer at Frances what is the
matter my poor wife Are you ill

Dagobert took Francess hand affectionately in his own but the latter
painfully agitated by these words pronounced with touching goodness
bowed her head and wept as she kissed her husbands hand The soldier
growing more and more uneasy as he felt the scalding tears of his wife
exclaimed You weep you do not answertell me then the cause of
your grief poor wife Is it because I spoke a little loud in asking
you how you could let the dear children go out with a neighbor Remember
their dying mother entrusted them to my caretis sacred you seeand
with them I am like an old hen after her chickens added he laughing
to enliven Frances

Yes you are right in loving them

Come thenbecalmyou know me of old With my great hoarse voice
I am not so bad a fellow at bottom As you can trust to this neighbor
there is no great harm done but in future my good Frances do not
take any step with regard to the children without consulting me They
asked I suppose to go out for a little stroll with Spoilsport

No my dear

No Who is this neighbor to whom you have entrusted them Where has
she taken them What time will she bring them back

I do not know murmured Frances in a failing voice

You do not know cried Dagobert with indignation but restraining
himself he added in a tone of friendly reproach You do not know You
cannot even fix an hour or better still not entrust them to any one
The children must have been very anxious to go out They knew that I
should return at any moment so why not wait for meeh Frances I ask
you why did they not wait for me Answer me will youZounds you
would make a saint swear cried Dagobert stamping his foot answer
me I say

The courage of Frances was fast failing These pressing and reiterated
questions which might end by the discovery of the truth made her
endure a thousand slow and poignant tortures She preferred coming
at once to the point and determined to bear the full weight of her
husbands anger like a humble and resigned victim obstinately faithful
to the promise she had sworn to her confessor

Not having the strength to rise she bowed her head allowed her arms to
fall on either side of the chair and said to her husband in a tone of
the deepest despondency Do with me what you willbut do not ask what
is become of the childrenI cannot answer you

If a thunderbolt had fallen at the feet of the soldier he would not
have been more violently more deeply moved he became deadly pale his
bald forehead was covered with cold sweat with fixed and staring look
he remained for some moments motionless mute and petrified Then as
if roused with a start from this momentary torpor and filled with a
terrific energy he seized his wife by the shoulders lifted her like
a feather placed her on her feet before him and leaning over her
exclaimed in a tone of mingled fury and despair The children

Mercy mercy gasped Frances in a faint voice

Where are the children repeated Dagobert as he shook with his
powerful hands that poor frail body and added in a voice of thunder
Will you answer the children

Kill me or forgive me I cannot answer you replied the unhappy
woman with that inflexible yet mild obstinacy peculiar to timid
characters when they act from convictions of doing right

Wretch cried the soldier wild with rage grief despair he lifted
up his wife as if he would have dashed her upon the floorbut he was
too brave a man to commit such cowardly cruelty and after that first
burst of involuntary fury he let her go

Overpowered Frances sank upon her knees clasped her hands and by the
faint motion of her lips it was clear that she was praying Dagobert
had then a moment of stunning giddiness his thoughts wandered what had
just happened was so sudden so incomprehensible that it required some
minutes to convince himself that his wife that angel of goodness whose
life had been one course of heroic selfdevotion and who knew what the
daughters of Marshal Simon were to him should say to him Do not ask
me about themI cannot answer you

The firmest the strongest mind would have been shaken by this
inexplicable fact But when the soldier had a little recovered himself
he began to look coolly at the circumstances and reasoned thus sensibly
with himself My wife alone can explain to me this inconceivable
mysteryI do not mean either to beat or kill herlet us try every
possibly method therefore to induce her to speak and above all let
me try to control myself

He took a chair handed another to his wife who was still on her
knees and said to her Sit down With an air of the utmost dejection
Frances obeyed

Listen to me wife resumed Dagobert in a broken voice interrupted
by involuntary starts which betrayed the boiling impatience he
could hardly restrain Understand methis cannot pass over in this
manneryou know I will never use violence towards youjust now I
gave way to a first moment of hastinessI am sorry for it Be sure I
shall not do so again but after all I must know what has become of
these children Their mother entrusted them to my care and I did not
bring them all the way from Siberia for you to say to me Do not ask
meI cannot tell you what I have done with them There is no reason in
that Suppose Marshal Simon were to arrive and say to me Dagobert
my children what answer am I to give him See I am calmjudge
for yourselfI am calmbut just put yourself in my place and tell
mewhat answer am I to give to the marshal Wellwhat say you Will
you speak

Alas my dear

It is of no use crying alas said the soldier wiping his forehead
on which the veins were swollen as if they would burst what am I to
answer to the marshal

Accuse me to himI will bear it allI will say

What will you say

That on going out you entrusted the two girls to me and that not
finding them on return you asked be about themand that my answer was
that I could not tell you what had become of them

And you think the marshal will be satisfied with such reasons cried
Dagobert clinching his fists convulsively upon his knees

Unfortunately I can give no othereither to him or younonot if I
were to die for it

Dagobert bounded from his chair at this answer which was given with
hopeless resignation His patience was exhausted but determined not to
yield to new bursts of anger or to spend his breath in useless menaces
he abruptly opened one of the windows and exposed his burning forehead
to the cool air A little calmer he walked up and down for a few
moments and then returned to seat himself beside his wife She with
her eyes bathed in tears fixed her gaze upon the crucifix thinking
that she also had to bear a heavy cross

Dagobert resumed By the manner in which you speak I see that no
accident has happened which might endanger the health of the children

No oh no thank God they are quite wellthat is all I can say to
you

Did they go out alone

I cannot answer you

Has any one taken them away

Alas my dear why ask me these questions I cannot answer you

Will they come back here

I do not know

Dagobert started up his patience was once more exhausted But after
taking a few turns in the room he again seated himself as before

After all said he to his wife you have no interest to conceal from
me what is become of the children Why refuse to let me know

I cannot do otherwise

I think you will change your opinion when you know something that I
am now forced to tell you Listen to me well added Dagobert in an
agitated voice if these children are not restored to me before the
13th of Februarya day close at handI am in the position of a
man that would rob the daughters of Marshal Simonrob them dye
understand said the soldier becoming more and more agitated Then
with an accent of despair which pierced Francess heart he continued
And yet I have done all that an honest man could do for those poor
childrenyou cannot tell what I have had to suffer on the roadmy
cares my anxietiesI a soldier with the charge of two girls It was
only by strength of heart by devotion that I could go through with
itand when for my reward I hoped to be able to say to their father
Here are your children The soldier paused To the violence of his
first emotions had succeeded a mournful tenderness he wept

At sight of the tears rolling slowly down Dagoberts gray moustache
Frances felt for a moment her resolution give way but recalling
the oath which she had made to her confessor and reflecting that the
eternal salvation of the orphans was at stake she reproached herself
inwardly with this evil temptation which would no doubt be severely
blamed by Abbe Dubois She answered therefore in a trembling voice
How can they accuse you of robbing these children

Know resumed Dagobert drawing his hand across his eyes that if
these young girls have braved so many dangers to come hither all the
way from Siberia it is that great interests are concernedperhaps
an immense fortuneand that if they are not present on the 13th
Februaryhere in Paris Rue Saint Francoisall will be lostand
through my faultfor I am responsible for your actions

The 13th February Rue Saint Francois cried Frances looking at her
husband with surprise Like Gabriel

What do you say about Gabriel

When I took him in poor deserted child he wore a bronze medal about
his neck

A bronze medal cried the soldier struck with amazement a bronze
medal with these words At Paris you will be the 13th of February
1832 Rue Saint Francois

Yeshow do you know

Gabriel too said the soldier speaking to himself Then he added
hastily Does Gabriel know that this medal was found upon him

I spoke to him of it at some time He had also about him a portfolio
filled with papers in a foreign tongue I gave them to Abbe Dubois my
confessor to look over He told me afterwards that they were of little
consequence and at a later period when a charitable person named
M Rodin undertook the education of Gabriel and to get him into the
seminary Abbe Dubois handed both papers and medal to him Since then I
have heard nothing of them

When Frances spoke of her confessor a sudden light flashed across the
mind of the soldier though he was far from suspecting the machinations
which had so long been at work with regard to Gabriel and the orphans
But he had a vague feeling that his wife was acting in obedience to some
secret influence of the confessionalan influence of which he could
not understand the aim or object but which explained in part at least
Francess inconceivable obstinacy with regard to the disappearance of
the orphans

After a moments reflection he rose and said sternly to his wife
looking fixedly at her There is a priest at the bottom of all this

What do you mean my dear

You have no interest to conceal these children You are one of the best
of women You see that I suffer if you only were concerned you would
have pity upon me

My dear

I tell you all this smacks of the confessional resumed Dagobert
You would sacrifice me and these children to your confessor but take
careI shall find out where he livesand a thousand thunders I will
go and ask him who is master in my house he or Iand if he does
not answer added the soldier with a threatening expression of
countenance I shall know how to make him speak

Gracious heaven cried Frances clasping her hands in horror at these
sacrilegious words remember he is a priest

A priest who causes discord treachery and misfortune in my house is
as much of a wretch as any other whom I have a right to call to account
for the evil he does to me and mine Therefore tell me immediately
where are the childrenor else I give you fair warning I will go and
demand them of the confessor Some crime is here hatching of which
you are an accomplice without knowing it unhappy woman Well I prefer
having to do with another than you

My dear said Frances in a mild firm voice you cannot think to
impose by violence on a venerable man who for twenty years has had the
care of my soul His age alone should be respected

No age shall prevent me

Heavens where are you going You alarm me

I am going to your church They must know you thereI will ask for
your confessorand we shall see

I entreat you my dear cried Frances throwing herself in a fright
before Dagobert who was hastening towards the door only think to
what you will expose yourself Heavens insult a priest Why it is one
of the reserved cases

These last words which appeared most alarming to the simplicity of
Dagoberts wife did not make any impression upon the soldier He
disengaged himself from her grasp and was going to rush out bareheaded
so high was his exasperation when the door opened and the commissary
of police entered followed by Mother Bunch and a policeman carrying
the bundle which he had taken from the young girl

The commissary cried Dagobert who recognized him by his official
scarf Ah so much the betterhe could not have come at a fitter
moment




CHAPTER LIII THE EXAMINATION

Mistress Frances Baudoin asked the magistrate

Yes sirit is I said Frances Then perceiving the pale and
trembling sewinggirl who did not dare to come forward she stretched
out her arms to her Oh my poor child she exclaimed bursting into
tears forgiveforgive ussince it is for our sake you have suffered
this humiliation

When Dagoberts wife had tenderly embraced the young sempstress the
latter turning towards the commissary said to him with an expression
of sad and touching dignity You see sir that I am not a thief

Madame said the magistrate addressing Frances am I to understand
that the silver mug the shawl the sheets contained in this bundle

Belong to me sir It was to render me a service that this dear girl
who is the best and most honest creature in the world undertook to
carry these articles to the pawnbrokers

Sir said the magistrate sternly to the policeman you have committed
a deplorable error I shall take care to report you and see that you
are punished You may go sir Then addressing Mother Bunch with an
air of real regret he added I can only express my sorrow for what has
happened Believe me I deeply feel for the cruel position in which you
have been placed

I believe it sir said Mother Bunch and I thank you Overcome by
so many emotions she sank upon a chair

The magistrate was about to retire when Dagobert who had been
seriously reflecting for some minutes said to him in a firm voice
Please to hear me Sir I have a deposition to make

Speak Sir

What I am about to say is very important it is to you in your quality
of a magistrate that I make this declaration

And as a magistrate I will hear you sir

I arrived here two days ago bringing with me from Russia two girls who
had been entrusted to me by their motherthe wife of Marshal Simon

Of Marshal Simon Duke de Ligny said the commissary very much
surprised

Yes Sir Well I left them here being obliged to get out on pressing
business This morning during my absence they disappearedand I am
certain I know the man who has been the cause of it

Now my dear said Frances much alarmed

Sir said the magistrate your declaration is a very serious one
Disappearance of personssequestration perhaps But are you quite
sure

These young ladies were here an hour ago I repeat sir that during my
absence they have been taken away

I do not doubt the sincerity of your declaration sir but still it is
difficult to explain so strange an abduction Who tells you that these
young girls will not return Besides whom do you suspect One word
before you make your accusation Remember it is the magistrate who
hears you On leaving this place the law will take its course in this
affair

That is what I wish Sir I am responsible for those young ladies to
their father He may arrive at any moment and I must be prepared to
justify myself

I understand all these reasons sir but still have a care you are not
deceived by unfounded suspicions Your denunciation once made I may
have to act provisionally against the person accused Now if you should
be under a mistake the consequences would be very serious for you and
without going further said the magistrate pointing to Mother Bunch
with emotion you see what are the results of a false accusation

You hear my dear cried Frances terrified at the resolution of
Dagobert to accuse Abbe Dubois do not say a word more I entreat you

But the more the soldier reflected the more he felt convinced that
nothing but the influence of her confessor could have induced Frances to
act as she had done so he resumed with assurance I accuse my wifes
confessor of being the principal or the accomplice in the abduction of
Marshal Simons daughters

Frances uttered a deep groan and hid her face in her hands while
Mother Bunch who had drawn nigh endeavored to console her The
magistrate had listened to Dagobert with extreme astonishment and he
now said to him with some severity Pray sir do not accuse unjustly
a man whose position is in the highest degree respectablea priest
siryes a priest I warned you beforehand to reflect upon what you
advanced All this becomes very serious and at your age any levity in
such matters would be unpardonable

Bless me sir said Dagobert with impatience at my age one has
common sense These are the facts My wife is one of the best and most
honorable of human creaturesask any one in the neighborhood and they
will tell you sobut she is a devotee and for twenty years she has
always seen with her confessors eyes She adores her son she loves me
also but she puts the confessor before us both

Sir said the commissary these family details

Are indispensable as you shall see I go out an hour ago to look
after this poor girl here When I come back the young ladies have
disappeared I ask my wife to whom she has entrusted them and where
they are she falls at my feet weeping and says Do what you will with
me but do not ask me what has become of the children I cannot answer
you

Is thus true madame cried the commissary looking at Frances with
surprise

Anger threats entreaties had no effect resumed Dagobert to
everything she answered as mildly as a saint I can tell you nothing
Now sir I maintain that my wife has no interest to take away these
children she is under the absolute dominion of her confessor she has
acted by his orders and for his purposes he is the guilty party

Whilst Dagobert spoke the commissary looked more and more attentively
at Frances who supported by the hunchback continued to weep bitterly
After a moments reflection the magistrate advanced towards Dagoberts
wife and said to her Madame you have heard what your husband has
just declared

Yes sir

What have you to say in your justification

But sir cried Dagobert it is not my wife that I accuseI do not
mean that it is her confessor

Sir you have applied to a magistrate and the magistrate must act as
he thinks best for the discovery of the truth Once more madame
he resumed addressing Frances what have you to say in your
justification

Alas nothing sir

Is it true that your husband left these young girls in your charge when
he went out

Yes sir

Is it true that on his return they were no longer to be found

Yes sir

Is it true that when he asked you where they were you told him that
you could give him no information on the subject

The commissary appeared to wait for Frances reply with kind of anxious
curiosity

Yes sir said she with the utmost simplicity that was the answer I
made my husband

What madame said the magistrate with an air of painful
astonishment that was your only answer to all the prayers and commands
of your husband What you refused to give him the least information It
is neither probable nor possible

It is the truth sir

Well but after all madame what have you done with the young ladies
that were entrusted to your care

I can tell you nothing about it sir If I would not answer my poor
husband I certainly will not answer any one else

Well sir resumed Dagobert was I wrong An honest excellent woman
like that who was always full of good sense and affection to talk in
this wayis it natural I repeat to you sir that it is the work of her
confessor act against him promptly and decidedly we shall soon know
all and my poor children will be restored to me

Madame continued the commissary without being able to repress a
certain degree of emotion I am about to speak to you very severely
My duty obliges me to do so This affair becomes so serious and
complicated that I must instantly commence judicial proceedings on the
subject You acknowledge that these young ladies have been left in your
charge and that you cannot produce them Now listen to me if you
refuse to give any explanation in the matter it is you alone that will
be accused of their disappearance I shall be obliged though with great
regret to take you into custody

Me cried Frances with the utmost alarm

Her exclaimed Dagobert never It is her confessor that I accuse
not my poor wife Take her into custody indeed He ran towards her as
if he would protect her

It is too late sir said the commissary You have made your charge
for the abduction of these two young ladies According to your wifes
own declaration she alone is compromised up to this point I must
take her before the Public Prosecutor who will decide what course to
pursue

And I say sir cried Dagobert in a menacing tone that my wife
shall not stir from this room

Sir said the commissary coolly I can appreciate your feelings but
in the interest of justice I would beg you not to oppose a necessary
measurea measure which moreover in ten minutes it would be quite
impossible for you to prevent

These words spoken with calmness recalled the soldier to himself
But sir said he I do not accuse my wife

Never mind my deardo not think of me said Frances with the
angelic resignation of a martyr The Lord is still pleased to try me
sorely but I am His unworthy servant and must gratefully resign myself
to His will Let them arrest me if they choose I will say no more in
prison than I have said already on the subject of those poor children

But sir cried Dagobert you see that my wife is out of her head
You cannot arrest her

There is no charge proof or indication against the other person whom
you accuse and whose character should be his protection If I take
your wife she may perhaps be restored to you after a preliminary
examination I regret added the commissary in a tone of pity to
have to execute such a mission at the very moment when your sons
arrest

What cried Dagobert looking with speechless astonishment at his wife
and Mother Bunch what does he say my son

You were not then aware of it Oh sir a thousand pardons said the
magistrate with painful emotion It is distressing to make you such a
communication

My son repeated Dagobert pressing his two hands to his forehead My
son arrested

For a political offence of no great moment said the commissary

Oh this is too much All comes on me at once cried the soldier
falling overpowered into a chair and hiding his face with his hands

After a touching farewell during which in spite of her terror Frances
remained faithful to the vow she had made to the Abbe DuboisDagobert
who had refused to give evidence against his wife was left leaning
upon a table exhausted by contending emotions and could not help
explaining Yesterday I had with me my wife my son my two poor
orphansand nowI am alonealone

The moment he pronounced these words in a despairing tone a mild sad
voice was heard close behind him saying timidly M Dagobert I am
here if you will allow me I will remain and wait upon you

It was Mother Bunch

Trusting that the readers sympathy is with the old soldier thus left
desolate with Agricola in his prison Adrienne in hers the madhouse
and Rose and Blanche Simon in theirs the nunnery we hasten to assure
him or her as the case may be that not only will their future steps
be traced but the dark machinations of the Jesuits and the thrilling
scenes in which new characters will perform their varied parts pervaded
by the watching spirit of the Wandering Jew will be revealed in Part
Second of this work entitled THE CHASTISEMENT

As the eagle perched upon the cliff commands an allcomprehensive
viewnot only of what happens on the plains and in the woodlands but
of matters occurring upon the heights which its aerie overlooks so may
the reader have sights pointed out to him which lie below the level of
the unassisted eye

In the year 1831 the powerful Order of the Jesuits saw fit to begin
to act upon information which had for some time been digesting in their
hands

As it related to a sum estimated at no less than thirty or forty
millions of francs it is no wonder that they should redouble all
exertions to obtain it from the rightful owners

These were presumably the descendants of Marius Count of Rennepont
in the reign of Louis XIV of France

They were distinguished from other men by a simple token which all in
the year above named had in their hands

It was a bronze medal bearing these legends on reverse and obverse

 PRAY FOR ME

Those who had this token were descendants of a family whom a hundred
and fifty years ago persecution scattered through the world in
emigration and exile in changes of religion fortune and name For this
familywhat grandeur what reverses what obscurity what lustre what
penury what glory How many crimes sullied how many virtues honored
it The history of this single family is the history of humanity
Passing through many generations throbbing in the veins of the poor
and the rich the sovereign and the bandit the wise and the simple the
coward and the brave the saint and the atheist the blood flowed on to
the year we have named

Seven representatives summed up the virtue courage degradation
splendor and poverty of the race Seven two orphan twin daughters of
exiled parents a dethroned prince a humble missionary priest a man
of the middle class a young lady of high name and large fortune and a
working man

Fate scattered them in Russia India France and America

The orphans Rose and Blanche Simon had left their dead mothers grave
in Siberia under charge of a trooper named Francis Baudoin alias
Dagobert who was as much attached to them as he had been devoted to
their father his commanding general

On the road to France this little party had met the first check in the
only tavern of Mockern village Not only had a wild beast showman known
as Morok the liontamer sought to pick a quarrel with the inoffensive
veteran but that failing had let a panther of his menagerie loose
upon the soldiers horse That horse had carried Dagobert under General
Simons and the Great Napoleons eyes through many battles had borne
the Generals wife a Polish lady under the Czars ban to her home of
exile in Siberia and their children now across Russia and Germany but
only to perish thus cruelly An unseen hand appeared in a manifestation
of spite otherwise unaccountable Dagobert denounced as a French spy
and his fair young companions accused of being adventuresses to help his
designs had so kindled at the insult not less to him than to his old
commanders daughters that he had taught the pompous burgomaster of
Mockern a lesson which however resulted in the imprisonment of the
three in Leipsic jail

General Simon who had vainly sought to share his masters St Helena
captivity had gone to fight the English in India But notwithstanding
his drilling of Radjasings sepoys they had been beaten by the troops
taught by Clive and not only was the old king of Mundi slain and the
realm added to the Companys land but his son Prince Djalma taken
prisoner However at length released he had gone to Batavia with
General Simon The princes mother was a Frenchwoman and among the
property she left him in the capital of Java the general was delighted
to find just such another medal as he knew was in his wifes possession

The unseen hand of enmity had reached to him for letters miscarried
and he did not know either his wifes decease or that he had twin
daughters

By a trick on the eve of the steamship leaving Batavia for the Isthmus
of Suez Djalma was separated from his friend and sailing for Europe
alone the latter had to follow in another vessel

The missionary priest trod the war trails of the wilderness with that
faith and fearlessness which true soldiers of the cross should evince
In one of these heroic undertakings Indians had captured him and
dragging him to their village under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains
they had nailed him in derision to a cross and prepared to scalp him

But if an unseen hand of a foe smote or stabbed at the sons of
Rennepont a visible interpositor had often shielded them in various
parts of the globe

A man seeming of thirty years of age very tall with a countenance
as lofty as mournful marked by the black eyebrows meeting had thrown
himselfduring a battles heightbetween a gun of a park which General
Simon was charging and that officer The cannon vomited its hail of
death but when the flame and smoke had passed the tall man stood erect
as before smiling pityingly on the gunner who fell on his knees as
frightened as if he beheld Satan himself Again as General Simon lay
upon the lost field of Waterloo raging with his wounds eager to die
after such a defeat this same man staunched his hurts and bade him
live for his wifes sake

Years after wearing the same unalterable look this man accosted
Dagobert in Siberia and gave him for General Simons wife the diary
and letters of her husband written in India in little hope of them
ever reaching her hands And at the year our story opens this man
unbarred the celldoor of Leipsic jail and let Dagobert and the orphans
out free to continue their way into France

On the other hand when the scalpingknife had traced its mark around
the head of Gabriel the missionary and when only the dexterous turn and
tug would have removed the trophy a sudden apparition had terrified
the superstitious savages It was a woman of thirty whose brown
tresses formed a rich frame around a royal face toned down by endless
sorrowing The redskins shrank from her steady advance and when her
hand was stretched out between them and their young victim they uttered
a howl of alarm and fled as if a host of their foemen were on their
track Gabriel was saved but all his life he was doomed to bear that
halo of martyrdom the circling sweep of the scalpers knife

He was a Jesuit By the orders of his society he embarked for Europe We
should say here that he though owning a medal of the seven described
was unaware that he should have worn it His vessel was driven by storms
to refit at the Azores where he had changed ship into the same as was
bearing Prince Djalma to France via Portsmouth

But the gales followed him and sated their fury by wrecking the Black
Eagle on the Picardy coast This was at the same point as were a
disabled Hamburg steamer among whose passengers where Dagobert and his
two charges was destroyed the same night Happily the tempest did not
annihilate them all There were saved Prince Djalma and a countryman
of his one Faringhea a Thuggee chief hunted out of British India
Dagobert and Rose and Blanche Simon whom Gabriel had rescued These
survivors had recovered thanks to the care they had received in
Cardoville House a country mansion which had sheltered them and except
the prince and the Strangler chief the others were speedily able to go
on to Paris

The old grenadier and the orphansuntil General Simon should be
heard fromdwelt in the formers house His son had kept it from his
mothers love for the lifelong home It was such a mean habitation as
a workman like Agricola Baudoin could afford to pay the rent of and far
from the fit abode of the daughters of the Duke de Ligny and Marshal of
France which Napoleon had created General Simon though the rank had
only recently been approved by the restoration

But in Paris the unknown hostile hand showed itself more malignant than
ever

The young lady of high name and large fortune was Adrienne de
Cardoville whose aunt the Princess de SaintDizier was a Jesuit
Through her and her accomplices machinations the young ladys forward
yet virtuous wildly aspiring but sensible romantic but just character
was twisted into a passable reason for her immurement in a madhouse

This asylum adjoined St Marys Convent into which Rose and Blanche
Simon were deceitfully conducted To secure their removal Dagobert had
been decoyed into the country under pretence of showing some of General
Simons documents to a lawyer his son Agricola arrested for treason
on account of some idle verses the blacksmith poet was guilty of and
his wife rendered powerless or rather a passive assistant by the
influence of the confessional When Dagobert hurried back from his wild
goose chase he found the orphans gone Mother Bunch a fellowtenant of
the house who had been brought up in the family ignorant and his wife
stubbornly refusing to break the promise she had given her confessor
and acquaint a single soul where she had permitted the girls to be
taken In his rage the soldier rashly accused that confessor but
instead of arresting the Abbe Dubois it was Mrs Baudoin whom the
magistrate felt compelled to arrest as the person whom alone
he ventured to commit for examination in regard to the orphans
disappearance Thus triumphs for the time being the unseen foe

The orphans in a nunnery the dethroned prince a poor castaway in a
foreign land the noble young lady in a madhouse the missionary priest
under the thumb of his superiors

As for the man of the middle class and the working man who concluded
the list of this family we are to read of them as well as of the
others in the pages which now succeed these




CHAPTER I THE MASQUERADE

The following day to that on which Dagoberts wife arrested for not
accounting for the disappearance of General Simons daughters was led
away before a magistrate a noisy and animated scene was transpiring
on the Place du Chatelet in front of a building whose first floor and
basement were used as the taprooms of the Sucking Calf publichouse

A carnival night was dying out

Quite a number of maskers grotesquely and shabbily bedecked had rushed
out of the low dancehouses in the Guildhall Ward and were roaring out
staves of songs as they crossed the square But on catching sight of a
second troop of mummers running about the waterside the first party
stopped to wait for the others to come up rejoicing with many a shout
in hopes of one of those verbal battles of slang and smutty talk which
made Vade so illustrious

This mobnearly all its members half seas over soon swollen by the
many people who have to be up early to follow their craftssuddenly
concentrated in one of the corners of the square so that a pale
deformed girl who was going that way was caught in the human tide
This was Mother Bunch Up with the lark she was hurrying to receive
some work from her employer Remembering how a mob had treated her when
she had been arrested in the streets only the day before by mistake
the poor workgirls fears may be imagined when she was now surrounded
by the revellers against her will But spite of all her effortsvery
feeble alasshe could not stir a step for the band of merrymakers
newly arriving had rushed in among the others shoving some of them
aside pushing far into the mass and sweeping Mother Bunchwho was in
their wayclear over to the crowd around the publichouse

The newcomers were much finer rigged out than the others for they
belonged to the gay turbulent class which goes frequently to the
Chaumiere the Prado the Colisee and other more or less rowdyish
haunts of waltzers made up generally of students shopgirls and
counter skippers clerks unfortunates etc etc

This set while retorting to the chaff of the other party seemed to be
very impatiently expecting some singularly desired person to put in her
appearance

The following snatches of conversation passing between clowns and
columbines pantaloons and fairies Turks and sultans debardeurs and
debardeuses paired off more or less properly will give an idea of the
importance of the wishedfor personage

They ordered the spread to be for seven in the morning so their
carriages ought to have come up afore now

Werry like but the Bacchanal Queen has got to lead off the last dance
in the Prado

I wish to thunder Id a known that and Id a stayed there to see
hermy beloved Queen

Gobinet if you call her your beloved Queen again Ill scratch you
Heres a pinch for you anyhow

Ow wow Celeste hands off You are blackspotting the beyutiful
white satin jacket my mamma gave me when I first came out as Don
Pasqually

Why did you call the Bacchanal Queen your beloved then What am I Id
like to know

You are my beloved but not my Queen for there is only one moon in
the nights of nature and only one Bacchanal Queen in the nights at the
Prado

Thats a bit from a valentine You cant come over me with such
rubbish

Gobinets right the Queen was an outandouter tonight

In prime feather

I never saw her more on the go

And my eyes wasnt her dress stunning

Took your breath away

Crushing

Heavy

Immense

The last kick

No one but she can get up such dresses

And then the dance

Oh yes it was at once bounding waving twisting There is not such
another bayadere under the nightcap of the sky

Gobinet give me back my shawl directly You have already spoilt it
by rolling it round your great body I dont choose to have my things
ruined for hulking beasts who call other women bayaderes

Celeste simmer down I am disguised as a Turk and when I talk of
bayaderes I am only in character

Your Celeste is like them all Gobinet shes jealous of the Bacchanal
Queen

Jealousdo you think me jealous Well now thats too bad If I chose
to be as showy as she is they would talk of me as much After all its
only a nickname that makes her reputation nickname

In that you have nothing to envy hersince you are called Celeste

You know well enough Gobinet that Celeste is my real name

Yes but its fancied a nicknamewhen one looks in your face

Gobinet I will put that down to your account

And Oscar will help you to add it up eh

Yes and you shall see the total When I carry one the remainder will
not be you

Celeste you make me cry I only meant to say that your celestial name
does not go well with your charming little face which is still more
mischievous than that of the Bacchanal Queen

Thats right wheedle me now wretch

I swear by the accursed head of my landlord that if you liked you
could spread yourself as much as the Bacchanal Queenwhich is saying a
great deal

The fact is that the Bacchanal had cheek enough in all conscience

Not to speak of her fascinating the bobbies

And magnetizing the beaks

They may get as angry as they please she always finishes by making
them laugh

And they all call her Queen

Last night she charmed a slop as modest as a country girl whose
purity took up arms against the famous dance of the Stormblown Tulip

What a quadrille Sleepinbuff and the Bacchanal Queen having opposite
to them RosePompon and Ninny Moulin

And all four making tulips as fullblown as could be

Bythebye is it true what they say of Ninny Moulin

What

Why that he is a writer and scribbles pamphlets on religion

Yes it is true I have often seen him at my employers with whom he
deals a bad paymaster but a jolly fellow

And pretends to be devout eh

I believe you my boywhen it is necessary then he is my Lord
Dumoulin as large as life He rolls his eyes walks with his head on
one side and his toes turned in but when the piece is played out he
slips away to the balls of which he is so fond The girls christened him
Ninny Moulin Add that he drinks like a fish and you have the photo
of the cove All this doesnt prevent his writing for the religious
newspapers and the saints whom he lets in even oftener than himself
are ready to swear by him You should see his articles and his
tractsonly see not readevery page is full of the devil and
his horns and the desperate fryings which await your impious
revolutionistsand then the authority of the bishops the power of the
Popehang it how could I know it all This toper Ninny Moulin gives
good measure enough for their money

The fact is that he is both a heavy drinker and a heavy swell How
he rattled on with little RosePompon in the dance and the fullblown
tulip

And what a rum chap he looked in his Roman helmet and topboots

RosePompon dances divinely too she has the poetic twist

And dont show her heels a bit

Yes but the Bacchanal Queen is six thousand feet above the level of
any common legshaker I always come back to her step last night in the
fullblown tulip

It was huge

It was serene

If I were father of a family I would entrust her with the education of
my sons

It was that step however which offended the bobbys modesty

The fact is it was a little free

Free as airso the policeman comes up to her and says Well
my Queen is your foot to keep on agoin up forever No modest
warrior replies the Queen I practice the step only once every
evening to be able to dance it when I am old I made a vow of it that
you might become an inspector

What a comic card

I dont believe she will remain always with Sleepinbuff

Because he has been a workman

What nonsense it would preciously become us students and shopboys
to give ourselves airs No but I am astonished at the Queens
fidelity

Yestheyve been a team for three or four good months

Shes wild upon him and he on her

They must lead a gay life

Sometimes I ask myself where the devil Sleepinbuff gets all the money
he spends It appears that he pays all last nights expenses three
coachesandfour and a breakfast this morning for twenty at ten francs
ahead

They say he has come into some property Thats why Ninny Moulin who
has a good nose for eating and drinking made acquaintance with him last
nightleaving out of the question that he may have some designs on the
Bacchanal Queen

He In a lot Hes rather too ugly The girls like to dance with him
because he makes people laughbut thats all Little RosePompon who
is such a pretty creature has taken him as a harmless chapherown in
the absence of her student

The coaches the coaches exclaimed the crowd all with one voice

Forced to stop in the midst of the maskers Mother Bunch had not lost
a word of this conversation which was deeply painful to her as it
concerned her sister whom she had not seen for a long time Not that
the Bacchanal Queen had a bad heart but the sight of the wretched
poverty of Mother Buncha poverty which she had herself shared but
which she had not had the strength of mind to bear any longercaused
such bitter grief to the gay thoughtless girl that she would no more
expose herself to it after she had in vain tried to induce her sister
to accept assistance which the latter always refused knowing that its
source could not be honorable

The coaches the coaches once more exclaimed the crowd as they
pressed forward with enthusiasm so that Mother Bunch carried on
against her will was thrust into the foremost rank of the people
assembled to see the show

It was indeed a curious sight A man on horseback disguised as a
postilion his blue jacket embroidered with silver and enormous tail
from which the powder escaped in puffs and a hat adorned with long
ribbons preceded the first carriage cracking his whip and crying with
all his might Make way for the Bacchanal Queen and her court

In an open carriage drawn by four lean horses on which rode two old
postilions dressed as devils was raised a downright pyramid of men and
women sitting standing leaning in every possible variety of odd
extravagant and grotesque costume altogether an indescribable mass of
bright colors flowers ribbons tinsel and spangles Amid this heap of
strange forms and dresses appeared wild or graceful countenances ugly
or handsome featuresbut all animated by the feverish excitement of
a jovial frenzyall turned with an expression of fanatical admiration
towards the second carriage in which the Queen was enthroned whilst
they united with the multitude in reiterated shouts of Long live the
Bacchanal Queen

This second carriage open like the first contained only the four
dancers of the famous step of the Stormblown TulipNinny Moulin Rose
Pompon Sleepinbuff and the Bacchanal Queen

Dumoulin the religious writer who wished to dispute possession of Mme
de la SainteColombe with his patron M RodinDumoulin surnamed
Ninny Moulin standing on the front cushions would have presented a
magnificent study for Callot or Gavarni that eminent artist who
unites with the biting strength and marvellous fancy of an illustrious
caricaturist the grace the poetry and the depth of Hogarth

Ninny Moulin who was about thirtyfive years of age wore very much
back upon his head a Roman helmet of silver paper A voluminous plume of
black feathers rising from a red wood holder was stuck on one side
of this headgear breaking the too classic regularity of its outline
Beneath this casque shone forth the most rubicund and jovial face that
ever was purpled by the fumes of generous wine A prominent nose with
its primitive shape modestly concealed beneath a luxuriant growth of
pimples half red half violet gave a funny expression to a perfectly
beardless face while a large mouth with thick lips turning their
insides outwards added to the air of mirth and jollity which beamed
from his large gray eyes set flat in his head

On seeing this joyous fellow with a paunch like Silenus one could not
help asking how it was that he had not drowned in wine a hundred times
over the gall bile and venom which flowed from his pamphlets against
the enemies of Ultramontanism and how his Catholic beliefs could float
upwards in the midst of these mad excesses of drink and dancing The
question would have appeared insoluble if one had not remembered how
many actors who play the blackest and most hateful first robbers on the
stage are when off it the best fellow in the world

The weather being cold Ninny Moulin wore a kind of boxcoat which
being halfopen displayed his cuirass of scales and his fleshcolored
pantaloons finishing just below the calf in a pair of yellow tops to
his boots Leaning forward in front of the carriage he uttered wild
shouts of delight mingled with the words Long live the Bacchanal
Queenafter which he shook and whirled the enormous rattle he held
in his hand Standing beside him Sleepinbuff waved on high a banner
of white silk on which were the words Love and joy to the Bacchanal
Queen

Sleepinbuff was about twentyfive years of age His countenance was gay
and intelligent surrounded by a collar of chestnutcolored whiskers
but worn with late hours and excesses it expressed a singular mixture
of carelessness and hardihood recklessness and mockery still no base
or wicked passion had yet stamped there its fatal impress He was the
perfect type of the Parisian as the term is generally applied whether
in the army in the provinces on board a kings ship or a merchantman
It is not a compliment and yet it is far from being an insult it is an
epithet which partakes at once of blame admiration and fear for if
in this sense the Parisian is often idle and rebellious he is also
quick at his work resolute in danger and always terribly satirical and
fond of practical jokes

He was dressed in a very flashy style He wore a black velvet jacket
with silver buttons a scarlet waistcoat trousers with broad blue
stripes a Cashmere shawl for a girdle with ends loosely floating and
a chimneypot hat covered with flowers and streamers This disguise set
off his light easy figure to great advantage

At the back of the carriage standing up on the cushions were Rose
Pompon and the Bacchanal Queen

RosePompon formerly a fringemaker was about seventeen years old and
had the prettiest and most winning little face imaginable She was gayly
dressed in debardeur costume Her powdered wig over which was smartly
cocked on one side an orange and green cap laced with silver increased
the effect of her bright black eyes and of her round carnation cheeks
She wore about her neck an orangecolored cravat of the same material
as her loose sash Her tight jacket and narrow vest of light green
velvet with silver ornaments displayed to the best advantage a
charming figure the pliancy of which must have well suited the
evolutions of the Storm blown Tulip Her large trousers of the same
stuff and color as the jacket were not calculated to hide any of her
attractions

The Bacchanal Queen being at the least a head taller leaned with one
hand on the shoulder of RosePompon Mother Bunchs sister ruled like
a true monarch over this mad revelry which her very presence seemed
to inspire such influence had her own mirth and animation over all that
surrounded her

She was a tall girl of about twenty years of age light and graceful
with regular features and a merry racketing air Like her sister she
had magnificent chestnut hair and large blue eyes but instead of being
soft and timid like those of the young sempstress the latter shone
with indefatigable ardor in the pursuit of pleasure Such was the energy
of her vivacious constitution that notwithstanding many nights and
days passed in one continued revel her complexion was as pure her
cheeks as rosy her neck as fresh and fair as if she had that morning
issued from some peaceful home Her costume though singular
and fantastic suited her admirably It was composed of a tight
longwaisted bodice in cloth of gold trimmed with great bunches of
scarlet ribbon the ends of which streamed over her naked arms and
a short petticoat of scarlet velvet ornamented with golden beads and
spangles This petticoat reached half way down a leg at once trim and
strong in a white silk stocking and red buskin with brass heel

Never had any Spanish dancer a more supple elastic and tempting form
than this singular girl who seemed possessed with the spirit of dancing
and perpetual motion for almost every moment a slight undulation of
head hips and shoulders seemed to follow the music of an invisible
orchestra while the tip of her right foot placed on the carriage door
in the most alluring manner continued to beat timefor the Bacchanal
Queen stood proudly erect upon the cushions

A sort of gilt diadem the emblem of her noisy sovereignty hung with
little bells adorned her forehead Her long hair in two thick braids
was drawn back from her rosy cheeks and twisted behind her head Her
left hand rested on little RosePompons shoulder and in her right she
held an enormous nosegay which she waved to the crowd accompanying
each salute with bursts of laughter

It would be difficult to give a complete idea of this noisily animated
and fantastic scene which included also a third carriage filled like
the first with a pyramid of grotesque and extravagant masks Amongst
the delighted crowd one person alone contemplated the picture with deep
sorrow It was Mother Bunch who was still kept in spite of herself in
the first rank of spectators

Separated from her sister for a long time she now beheld her in all the
pomp of her singular triumph in the midst of the cries of joy and
the applause of her companions in pleasure Yet the eyes of the young
sempstress grew dim with tears for though the Bacchanal Queen seemed
to share in the stunning gayety of all around herthough her face was
radiant with smiles and she appeared fully to enjoy the splendors
of her temporary elevationyet she had the sincere pity of the poor
workwoman almost in rags who was seeking with the first dawn of
morning the means of earning her daily bread

Mother Bunch had forgotten the crowd to look only at her sister
whom she tenderly lovedonly the more tenderly that she thought her
situation to be pitied With her eyes fixed on the joyous and beautiful
girl her pale and gentle countenance expressed the most touching and
painful interest

All at once as the brilliant glance of the Bacchanal Queen travelled
along the crowd it lighted on the sad features of Mother Bunch

My sister exclaimed Cephysesuch was the name of the Bacchanal
QueenMy sisterand with one bound light as a balletdancer she
sprang from her movable throne which fortunately just happened to
be stopping and rushing up to the hunchback embraced her
affectionately

All this had passed so rapidly that the companions of the Bacchanal
Queen still stupefied by the boldness of her perilous leap knew not
how to account for it whilst the masks who surrounded Mother Bunch drew
back in surprise and the latter absorbed in the delight of embracing
her sister whose caresses she returned did not even think of the
singular contrast between them which was sure to soon excite the
astonishment and hilarity of the crowd

Cephyse was the first to think of this and wishing to save her sister
at least one humiliation she turned towards the carriage and said
Rose Pompon throw me down my cloak and Ninny Moulin open the door
directly

Having received the cloak the Bacchanal Queen hastily wrapped it round
her sister before the latter could speak or move Then taking her by
the hand she said to her Come come

I cried Mother Bunch in alarm Do not think of it

I must speak with you I will get a private room where we shall be
alone So make haste dear little sister Do not resist before all these
peoplebut come

The fear of becoming a public sight decided Mother Bunch who confused
moreover with the adventure trembling and frightened followed her
sister almost mechanically and was dragged by her into the carriage of
which Ninny Moulin had just opened the door And so with the cloak of
the Bacchanal Queen covering Mother Bunchs poor garments and deformed
figure the crowd had nothing to laugh at and only wondered what this
meeting could mean while the coaches pursued their way to the eating
house in the Place du Chatelet




CHAPTER II THE CONTRAST

Some minutes after the meeting of Mother Bunch with the Bacchanal Queen
the two sisters were alone together in a small room in the tavern

Let me kiss you again said Cephyse to the young sempstress at least
now we are alone you will not be afraid

In the effort of the Bacchanal Queen to clasp Mother Bunch in her arms
the cloak fell from the form of the latter At sight of those miserable
garments which she had hardly had time to observe on the Place du
Chatelet in the midst of the crowd Cephyse clasped her hands and
could not repress an exclamation of painful surprise Then approaching
her sister that she might contemplate her more closely she took her
thin icy palms between her own plump hands and examined for some
minutes with increasing grief the suffering pale unhappy creature
ground down by watching and privations and halfclothed in a poor
patched cotton gown

Oh sister to see you thus Unable to articulate another word the
Bacchanal Queen threw herself on the others neck and burst into tears
Then in the midst of her sobs she added Pardon pardon

What is the matter my dear Cephyse said the young sewinggirl
deeply moved and gently disengaging herself from the embrace of her
sister Why do you ask my pardon

Why resumed Cephyse raising her countenance bathed in tears and
purple with shame is it not shameful of me to be dressed in all this
frippery and throwing away so much money in follies while you are thus
miserably clad and in need of everythingperhaps dying of want for I
have never seen your poor face look so pale and worn

Be at ease dear sister I am not ill I was up rather late last night
and that makes me a little palebut pray do not cryit grieves me

The Bacchanal Queen had but just arrived radiant in the midst of the
intoxicated crowd and yet it was Mother Bunch who was now employed in
consoling her

An incident occurred which made the contrast still more striking
Joyous cries were heard suddenly in the next apartment and these words
were repeated with enthusiasm Long live the Bacchanal Queen

Mother Bunch trembled and her eyes filled with tears as she saw her
sister with her face buried in her hands as if overwhelmed with shame
Cephyse she said I entreat you not to grieve so You will make me
regret the delight of this meeting which is indeed happiness to me It
is so long since I saw you But tell mewhat ails you

You despise me perhapsyou are right said the Bacchanal Queen
drying her tears

Despise you for what

Because I lead the life I do instead of having the courage to support
misery along with you

The grief of Cephyse was so heartbreaking that Mother Bunch always
good and indulgent wishing to console her and raise her a little in
her own estimation said to her tenderly In supporting it bravely for
a whole year my good Cephyse you have had more merit and courage than
I should have in bearing with it my whole life

Oh sister do not say that

In simple truth returned Mother Bunch to what temptations is a
creature like me exposed Do I not naturally seek solitude even as
you seek a noisy life of pleasure What wants have I A very little
suffices

But you have not always that little

Nobut weak and sickly as I seem I can endure some privations better
than you could Thus hunger produces in me a sort of numbness which
leaves me very feeblebut for you robust and full of life hunger is
fury is madness Alas you must remember how many times I have seen
you suffering from those painful attacks when work failed us in our
wretched garret and we could not even earn our four francs a weekso
that we had nothingabsolutely nothing to eatfor our pride prevented
us from applying to the neighbors

You have preserved the right to that honest pride

And you as well Did you not struggle as much as a human creature
could But strength fails at lastI know you well Cephyseit was
hunger that conquered you and the painful necessity of constant labor
which was yet insufficient to supply our common wants

But you could endure those privationsyou endure them still

Can you compare me with yourself Look said Mother Bunch taking her
sister by the hand and leading her to a mirror placed above a couch
lookDost think that God made you so beautiful endowed you with such
quick and ardent blood with so joyous animated grasping a nature
and with such taste and fondness for pleasure that your youth might be
spent in a freezing garret hid from the sun nailed constantly to your
chair clad almost in rags and working without rest and without hope
No for He has given us other wants than those of eating and drinking
Even in our humble condition does not beauty require some little
ornament Does not youth require some movement pleasure gayety Do not
all ages call for relaxation and rest Had you gained sufficient wages
to satisfy hunger to have a day or sos amusement in the week after
working every other day for twelve or fifteen hours and to procure
the neat and modest dress which so charming a face might naturally
claimyou would never have asked for more I am sure of ityou have
told me as much a hundred times You have yielded therefore to an
irresistible necessity because your wants are greater than mine

It is true replied the Bacchanal Queen with a pensive air if I
could but have gained eighteenpence a day my life would have been quite
different for in the beginning sister I felt cruelly humiliated to
live at a mans expense

Yes yesit was inevitable my dear Cephyse I must pity but cannot
blame you You did not choose your destiny but like me you have
submitted to it

Poor sister said Cephyse embracing the speaker tenderly you can
encourage and console me in the midst of your own misfortunes when I
ought to be pitying you

Be satisfied said Mother Bunch God is just and good If He has
denied me many advantages He has given me my joys as you have yours

Joys

Yes and great oneswithout which life would be too burdensome and I
should not have the courage to go through with it

I understand you said Cephyse with emotion you still know how to
devote yourself for others and that lightens your own sorrows

I do what I can but alas it is very little yet when I succeed
added Mother Bunch with a faint smile I am as proud and happy as a
poor little ant who after a great deal of trouble has brought a big
straw to the common nest But do not let us talk any more of me

Yes but I must even at the risk of making you angry resumed the
Bacchanal Queen timidly I have something to propose to you which you
once before refused Jacques Rennepont has still I think some money
leftwe are spending it in folliesnow and then giving a little to
poor people we may happen to meetI beg of you let me come to your
assistanceI see in your poor face you cannot conceal it from me that
you are wearing yourself out with toil

Thanks my dear Cephyse I know your good heart but I am not in want
of anything The little I gain is sufficient for me

You refuse me said the Bacchanal Queen sadly because you know
that my claim to this money is not honorablebe it soI respect your
scruples But you will not refuse a service from Jacques he has been a
workman like ourselves and comrades should help each other Accept it
I beseech you or I shall think you despise me

And I shall think you despise me if you insist any more upon it my
dear Cephyse said Mother Bunch in a tone at once so mild and firm
that the Bacchanal Queen saw that all persuasion would be in vain She
hung her head sorrowfully and a tear again trickled down her cheek

My refusal grieves you said the other taking her hand I am truly
sorrybut reflectand you will understand me

You are right said the Bacchanal Queen bitterly after a moments
silence you cannot accept assistance from my loverit was an insult
to propose it to you There are positions in life so humiliating that
they soil even the good one wishes to do

Cephyse I did not mean to hurt youyou know it well

Oh believe me replied the Bacchanal Queen gay and giddy as I am
I have sometimes moments of reflection even in the midst of my maddest
joy Happily such moments are rare

And what do you think of then

Why that the life I lead is hardly the thing then resolve to ask
Jacques for a small sum of money just enough to subsist on for a year
and form the plan of joining you and gradually getting to work again

The idea is a good one why not act upon it

Because when about to execute this project I examined myself
sincerely and my courage failed I feel that I could never resume the
habit of labor and renounce this mode of life sometimes rich as
to day sometimes precariousbut at least free and full of leisure
joyous and without care and at worst a thousand times preferable to
living upon four francs a week Not that interest has guided me Many
times have I refused to exchange a lover who had little or nothing
for a rich man that I did not like Nor have I ever asked anything for
myself Jacques has spent perhaps ten thousand francs the last three
or four months yet we only occupy two halffurnished rooms because
we always live out of doors like the birds fortunately when I first
loved him he had nothing at all and I had just sold some jewels
that had been given me for a hundred francs and put this sum in the
lottery As mad people and fools are always lucky I gained a prize of
four thousand francs Jacques was as gay and lightheaded and full of
fun as myself so we said We love each other very much and as long
as this money lasts we will keep up the racket when we have no more
one of two things will happeneither we shall be tired of one another
and so partor else we shall love each other still and then to remain
together we shall try and get work again and if we cannot do so and
yet will not parta bushel of charcoal will do our business

Good heaven cried Mother Bunch turning pale

Be satisfied we have not come to that We had still something left
when a kind of agent who had paid court to me but who was so ugly that
I could not bear him for all his riches knowing that I was living
with Jacques asked me toBut why should I trouble you with all these
details In one word he lent Jacques money on some sort of a doubtful
claim he had as was thought to inherit some property It is with this
money that we are amusing ourselvesas long as its lasts

But my dear Cephyse instead of spending this money so foolishly why
not put it out to interest and marry Jacques since you love him

Oh in the first place replied the Bacchanal Queen laughing as her
gay and thoughtless character resumed its ascendancy to put money out
to interest gives one no pleasure All the amusement one has is to look
at a little bit of paper which one gets in exchange for the nice little
pieces of gold with which one can purchase a thousand pleasures As for
marrying I certainly like Jacques better than I ever liked any one
but it seems to me that if we were married all our happiness would
endfor while he is only my lover he cannot reproach me with what has
passedbut as my husband he would be stare to upbraid me sooner or
later and if my conduct deserves blame I prefer giving it to myself
because I shall do it more tenderly

Mad girl that you are But this money will not last forever What is to
be done next

AfterwardsOh thats all in the moon Tomorrow seems to me as if it
would not come for a hundred years If we were always saying We must
die one day or the otherwould life be worth having

The conversation between Cephyse and her sister was here again
interrupted by a terrible uproar above which sounded the sharp shrill
noise of Ninny Moulins rattle To this tumult succeeded a chorus of
barbarous cries in the midst of which were distinguishable these words
which shook the very windows The Queen the Bacchanal Queen

Mother Bunch started at this sudden noise

It is only my court who are getting impatient said Cephyseand this
time she could laugh

Heavens cried the sewinggirl in alarm if they were to come here
in search of you

No nonever fear

But listen do you not hear those steps they are coming along the
passagethey are approaching Pray sister let me go out alone
without being seen by all these people

That moment the door was opened and Cephyse ran towards it She saw in
the passage a deputation headed by Ninny Moulin who was armed with his
formidable rattle and followed by RosePompon and Sleepinbuff

The Bacchanal Queen or I poison myself with a glass of water cried
Ninny Moulin

The Bacchanal Queen or I publish my banns of marriage with Ninny
Moulin cried little RosePompon with a determined air

The Bacchanal Queen or the court will rise in arms and carry her off
by force said another voice

Yes yeslet us carry her off repeated a formidable chorus

Jacques enter alone said the Bacchanal Queen notwithstanding these
pressing summonses then addressing her court in a majestic tone she
added In ten minutes I shall be at your serviceand then for aof a
time

Long live the Bacchanal Queen cried Dumoulin shaking his rattle as
he retired followed by the deputation whilst Sleepinbuff entered the
room alone

Jacques said Cephyse this is my good sister

Enchanted to see you said Jacques cordially the more so as you
will give me some news of my friend Agricola Since I began to play the
rich man we have not seen each other but I like him as much as ever
and think him a good and worthy fellow You live in the same house How
is he

Alas sir he and his family have had many misfortunes He is in
prison

In prison cried Cephyse

Agricola in prison what for said Sleepinbuff

For a trifling political offence We had hoped to get him out on bail

Certainly for five hundred francs it could be done said Sleepinbuff

Unfortunately we have not been able the person upon whom we relied

The Bacchanal Queen interrupted the speaker by saying to her lover Do
you hear Jacques Agricola in prison for want of five hundred francs

To be sure I hear and understand all about it No need of your
winking Poor fellow he was the support of his mother

Alas yes sirand it is the more distressing as his father has but
just returned from Russia and his mother

Here said Sleepinbuff interrupting and giving Mother Bunch a purse
take thisall the expenses here have been paid beforehandthis is
what remains of my last bag You will find here some twentyfive or
thirty Napoleons and I cannot make a better use of them than to serve
a comrade in distress Give them to Agricolas father he will take the
necessary steps and tomorrow Agricola will be at his forge where I
had much rather he should be than myself

Jacques give me a kiss said the Bacchanal Queen

Now and afterwards and again and again said Jacques joyously
embracing the queen

Mother Bunch hesitated for a moment but reflecting that after all
this sum of money which was about to be spent in follies would restore
life and happiness to the family of Agricola and that hereafter these
very five hundred francs when returned to Jacques might be of the
greatest use to him she resolved to accept this offer She took the
purse and with tearful eyes said to him I will not refuse your
kindness M Jacques you are so good and generous Agricolas father
will thus at least have one consolation in the midst of heavy sorrows
Thanks many thanks

There is no need to thank me money was made for others as well as
ourselves

Here without the noise recommenced more furiously than ever and Ninny
Moulins rattle sent forth the most doleful sounds

Cephyse said Sleepinbuff they will break everything to pieces
if you do not return to them and I have nothing left to pay for the
damage Excuse us added he laughing but you see that royalty has
its duties

Cephyse deeply moved extended her arms to Mother Bunch who threw
herself into them shedding sweet tears

And now said she to her sister when shall I see you again

Soonthough nothing grieves me more than to see you in want out of
which I am not allowed to help you

You will come then to see me It is a promise

I promise you in her name said Jacques we will pay a visit to you
and your neighbor Agricola

Return to the company Cephyse and amuse yourself with a light heart
for M Jacques has made a whole family happy

So saying and after Sleepinbuff had ascertained that she could go down
without being seen by his noisy and joyous companions Mother Bunch
quietly withdrew eager to carry one piece of good news at least to
Dagobert but intending first of all to go to the Rue de Babylone to
the gardenhouse formerly occupied by Adrienne de Cardoville We shall
explain hereafter the cause of this determination

As the girl quitted the eatinghouse three men plainly and comfortably
dressed were watching before it and talking in a low voice Soon
after they were joined by a fourth person who rapidly descended the
stairs of the tavern

Well said the three first with anxiety

He is there

Are you sure of it

Are there two Sleepersinbuff on earth replied the other I have
just seen him he is togged out like one of the swell mob They will be
at table for three hours at least

Then wait for me you others Keep as quiet as possible I will go and
fetch the captain and the game is bagged So saying one of the three
men walked off quickly and disappeared in a street leading from the
square

At this same instant the Bacchanal Queen entered the banquetingroom
accompanied by Jacques and was received with the most frenzied
acclamations from all sides

Now then cried Cephyse with a sort of feverish excitement as if she
wished to stun herself now then friendsnoise and tumult hurricane
and tempest thunder and earthquakeas much as you please Then
holding out her glass to Ninny Moulin she added Pour out pour out

Long live the Queen cried they all with one voice




CHAPTER III THE CAROUSE

The Bacchanal Queen having Sleepinbuff and RosePompon opposite her
and Ninny Moulin on her right hand presided at the repast called a
reveillematin wakemorning generously offered by Jacques to his
companions in pleasure

Both young men and girls seemed to have forgotten the fatigues of a
ball begun at eleven oclock in the evening and finished at six in
the morning and all these couples joyous as they were amorous and
indefatigable laughed ate and drank with youthful and Pantagruelian
ardor so that during the first part of the feast there was less
chatter than clatter of plates and glasses

The Bacchanal Queens countenance was less gay but much more animated
than usual her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes announced a feverish
excitement she wished to drown reflection cost what it might Her
conversation with her sister often recurred to her and she tried to
escape from such sad remembrances

Jacques regarded Cephyse from time to time with passionate adoration
for thanks to the singular conformity of character mind and taste
between him and the Bacchanal Queen their attachment had deeper and
stronger roots than generally belong to ephemeral connections founded
upon pleasure Cephyse and Jacques were themselves not aware of all the
power of a passion which till now had been surrounded only by joys and
festivities and not yet been tried by any untoward event

Little RosePompon left a widow a few days before by a student who in
order to end the carnival in style had gone into the country to raise
supplies from his family under one of those fabulous pretences which
tradition carefully preserves in colleges of law and medicineRose
Pompon we repeat an example of rare fidelity determined not to
compromise herself had taken for a chaperon the inoffensive Ninny
Moulin

This latter having doffed his helmet exhibited a bald head encircled
by a border of black curling hair pretty long at the back of the head
By a remarkable Bacchic phenomenon in proportion as intoxication gained
upon him a sort of zone as purple as his jovial face crept by degrees
over his brow till it obscured even the shining whiteness of his crown
RosePompon who knew the meaning of this symptom pointed it out to the
company and exclaimed with a loud burst of laughter Take care Ninny
Moulin the tide of the wine is coming in

When it rises above his head he will be drowned added the Bacchanal
Queen

Oh Queen dont disturb me I am meditating answered Dumoulin who
was getting tipsy He held in his hand in the fashion of an antique
goblet a punchbowl filled with wine for he despised the ordinary
glasses because of their small size

Meditating echoed RosePompon Ninny Moulin is meditating Be
attentive

He is meditating he must be ill then

What is he meditating an illegal dance

A forbidden Anacreontic attitude

Yes I am meditating returned Dumoulin gravely I am meditating
upon wine generally and in particularwine of which the immortal
BossuetDumoulin had the very bad habit of quoting Bossuet when he was
drunkof which the immortal Bossuet says and he was a judge of good
liquor In wine is courage strength joy and spiritual fervorwhen
one has any brains added Ninny Moulin by way of parenthesis

Oh my how I adore your Bossuet said RosePompon

As for my particular meditation it concerns the question whether the
wine at the marriage of Cana was red or white Sometimes I incline to
one side sometimes to the otherand sometimes to both at once

That is going to the bottom of the question said Sleepinbuff

And above all to the bottom of the bottles added the Bacchanal
Queen

As your majesty is pleased to observe and already by dint of
reflection and research I have made a great discoverynamely that if
the wine at the marriage of Cana was red

It couldnt a been white said RosePompon judiciously

And if I had arrived at the conviction that it was neither white nor
red asked Dumoulin with a magisterial air

That could only be when you had drunk till all was blue observed
Sleepinbuff

The partner of the Queen says well One may be too athirst for science
but never mind From all my studies on this question to which I have
devoted my lifeI shall await the end of my respectable career with
the sense of having emptied tuns with a historicaltheologicaland
archeological tone

It is impossible to describe the jovial grimace and tone with which
Dumoulin pronounced and accentuated these last words which provoked a
general laugh

Archieolopically said RosePompon What sawnee is that Has he a
tail does he live in the water

Never mind observed the Bacchanal Queen these are words of wise men
and conjurers they are like horsehair bustlesthey serve for filling
outthats all I like better to drink so fill the glasses Ninny
Moulin some champagne RosePompon heres to the health of your
Philemon and his speedy return

And to the success of his plant upon his stupid and stingy family
added RosePompon

The toast was received with unanimous applause

With the permission of her majesty and her court said Dumoulin I
propose a toast to the success of a project which greatly interests me
and has some resemblance to Philemons jockeying I fancy that the toast
will bring me luck

Lets have it by all means

Well thensuccess to my marriage said Dumoulin rising

These words provoked an explosion of shouts applause and laughter
Ninny Moulin shouted applauded laughed even louder than the rest
opening wide his enormous mouth and adding to the stunning noise the
harsh springing of his rattle which he had taken up from under his
chair

When the storm had somewhat subsided the Bacchanal Queen rose and said
I drink to the health of the future Madame Ninny Moulin

Oh Queen your courtesy touches me so sensibly that I must
allow you to read in the depths of my heart the name of my
future spouse exclaimed Dumoulin She is called Madame
HonoreeModesteMessalineAngele de la SainteColombe widow

Bravo bravo

She is sixty years old and has more thousands of francsayear than
she has hair in her gray moustache or wrinkles on her face she is
so superbly fat that one of her gowns would serve as a tent for this
honorable company I hope to present my future spouse to you on Shrove
Tuesday in the costume of a shepherdess that has just devoured her
flock Some of them wish to convert herbut I have undertaken to divert
her which she will like better You must help me to plunge her headlong
into all sorts of skylarking jollity

We will plunge her into anything you please

She shall dance like sixty said RosePompon humming a popular tune

She will overawe the police

We can say to them Respect this lady your mother will perhaps be as
old some day

Suddenly the Bacchanal Queen rose her countenance wore a singular
expression of bitter and sardonic delight In one hand she held a glass
full to the brim I hear the Cholera is approaching in his sevenleague
boots she cried I drink luck to the Cholera And she emptied the
bumper

Notwithstanding the general gayety these words made a gloomy
impression a sort of electric shudder ran through the assemblage and
nearly every countenance became suddenly serious

Oh Cephyse said Jacques in a tone of reproach

Luck to the Cholera repeated the Queen fearlessly Let him spare
those who wish to live and kill together those who dread to part

Jacques and Cephyse exchanged a rapid glance unnoticed by their joyous
companions and for some time the Bacchanal Queen remained silent and
thoughtful

If you put it that way it is different cried RosePompon boldly
To the Cholera may none but good fellows be left on earth

In spite of this variation the impression was still painfully
impressive Dumoulin wishing to cut short this gloomy subject
exclaimed Devil take the dead and long live the living And talking
of chaps who both live and live well I ask you to drink a health most
dear to our joyous queen the health of our Amphitryon Unfortunately
I do not know his respectable name having only had the advantage
of making his acquaintance this night he will excuse me then if I
confine myself to proposing the health of Sleepinbuffa name by no
means offensive to my modesty as Adam never slept in any other manner
I drink to Sleepinbuff

Thanks old son said Jacques gayly were I to forget your name I
should call you Haveasip and I am sure that you would answer I
will

I will directly said Dumoulin making the military salute with one
hand and holding out the bowl with the other

As we have drunk together resumed Sleepinbuff cordially we ought
to know each other thoroughly I am Jacques Rennepont

Rennepont cried Dumoulin who appeared struck by the name in spite
of his halfdrunkenness you are Rennepont

Rennepont in the fullest sense of the word Does that astonish you

There is a very ancient family of that namethe Counts of Rennepont

The deuce there is said the other laughing

The Counts of Rennepont are also Dukes of Cardoville added Dumoulin

Now come old fellow do I look as if I belonged to such a familyI
a workman out for a spree

You a workman why we are getting into the Arabian Nights cried
Dumoulin more and more surprised You give us a Belshazzars banquet
with accompaniment of carriages and four and yet are a workman Only
tell me your trade and I will join you leaving the Vine of the Divine
to take care of itself

Come I say dont think that I am a printer of flimsies and a
smasher replied Jacques laughing

Oh comrade no such suspicion

It would be excusable seeing the rigs I run But Ill make you easy on
that point I am spending an inheritance

Eating and drinking an uncle no doubt said Dumoulin benevolently

Faith I dont know

What you dont know whom you are eating and drinking

Why you see in the first place my father was a bonegrubber

The devil he was said Dumoulin somewhat out of countenance though
in general not overscrupulous in the choice of his bottlecompanions
but after the first surprise he resumed with the most charming
amenity There are some ragpickers very high by scentI mean
descent

To be sure you may think to laugh at me said Jacques but you are
right in this respect for my father was a man of very great merit He
spoke Greek and Latin like a scholar and often told me that he had not
his equal in mathematics besides he had travelled a good deal

Well then resumed Dumoulin whom surprise had partly sobered you
may belong to the family of the Counts of Rennepont after all

In which case said RosePompon laughing your father was not a
guttersnipe by trade but only for the honor of the thing

No noworse luck it was to earn his living replied Jacques but
in his youth he had been well off By what appeared or rather by
what did not appear he had applied to some rich relation and the
rich relation had said to him Much obliged try the workus Then he
wished to make use of his Greek and Latin and mathematics Impossible
to do anythingParis it seems being chokefull of learned menso
my father had to look for his bread at the end of a hooked stick and
there too he must have found it for I ate of it during two years
when I came to live with him after the death of an aunt with whom I had
been staying in the country

Your respectable father must have been a sort of philosopher said
Dumoulin but unless he found an inheritance in a dustbin I dont see
how you came into your property

Wait for the end of the song At twelve years of age I was an
apprentice at the factory of M Tripeaud two years afterwards my
father died of an accident leaving me the furniture of our garreta
mattress a chair and a tableand moreover in an old Eau de Cologne
box some papers written it seems in English and a bronze medal
worth about ten sous chain and all He had never spoken to me of these
papers so not knowing if they were good for anything I left them at
the bottom of an old trunk instead of burning themwhich was well for
me since it is upon these papers that I have had money advanced

What a godsend said Dumoulin But somebody must have known that you
had them

Yes one of those people that are always looking out for old debts came
to Cephyse who told me all about it and after he had read the papers
he said that the affair was doubtful but that he would lend me ten
thousand francs on it if I liked Ten thousand francs was a large sum
so I snapped him up

But you must have supposed that these old papers were of great value

Faith no since my father who ought to have known their value had
never realized on themand then you see ten thousand francs in good
bright coin falling as it were from the clouds are not to be sneezed
atso I took themonly the man made me do a bit of stiff as guarantee
or something of that kind

Did you sign it

Of coursewhat did I care about it The man told me it was only a
matter of form He spoke the truth for the bill fell due a fortnight
ago and I have heard nothing of it I have still about a thousand
francs in his hands for I have taken him for my banker And thats the
way old pal that Im able to flourish and be jolly all day long as
pleased as Punch to have left my old grinder of a master M Tripeaud

As he pronounced this name the joyous countenance of Jacques became
suddenly overcast Cephyse no longer under the influence of the painful
impression she had felt for a moment looked uneasily at Jacques for
she knew the irritation which the name of M Tripeaud produced within
him

M Tripeaud resumed Sleepinbuff is one that would make the good
bad and the bad worse They say that a good rider makes a good horse
they ought to say that a good master makes a good workman Zounds when
I think of that fellow cried Sleepinbuff striking his hand violently
on the table

Come Jacquesthink of something else said the Bacchanal Queen
Make him laugh RosePompon

I am not in a humor to laugh replied Jacques abruptly for he was
getting excited from the effects of the wine it is more than I can
bear to think of that man It exasperates me it drives me mad You
should have heard him saying Beggarly workmen rascally workmen they
grumble that they have no food in their bellies well then well give
them bayonets to stop their hunger11 And theres the children in his
factoryyou should see them poor little creaturesworking as long
as the menwasting away and dying by the dozenwhat odds as soon
as they were dead plenty of others came to take their placesnot like
horses which can only be replaced with money

Well it is clear that you do not like your old master said
Dumoulin more and more surprised at his Amphitryons gloomy and
thoughtful air and regretting that the conversation had taken this
serious turn he whispered a few words in the ear of the Bacchanal
Queen who answered by a sign of intelligence

I dont like M Tripeaud exclaimed Jacques I hate himand shall
I tell you why Because it is as much his fault as mine that I have
become a goodfornothing loafer I dont say it to screen myself but
it is the truth When I was prenticed to him as a lad I was all heart
and ardor and so bent upon work that I used to take my shirt off to
my task which by the way was the reason that I was first called
Sleepinbuff Well I might have toiled myself to death not one word of
encouragement did I receive I came first to my work and was the last
to leave off what matter it was not even noticed One day I was
injured by the machinery I was taken to the hospital When I came out
weak as I was I went straight to my work I was not to be frightened
the others who knew their master well would often say to me What
a muff you must be little one What good will you get by working so
hardstill I went on But one day a worthy old man called Father
Arsene who had worked in the house many years and was a model of good
conduct was suddenly turned away because he was getting too feeble It
was a deathblow to him his wife was infirm and at his age he could
not get another place When the foreman told him he was dismissed he
could not believe it and he began to cry for grief At that moment M
Tripeaud passes Father Arsene begs him with clasped hands to keep him
at halfwages What says M Tripeaud shrugging his shoulders do
you think that I will turn my factory into a house of invalids You are
no longer able to workso be off But I have worked forty years of my
life what is to become of me cried poor Father Arsene That is not
my business answered M Tripeaud and addressing his clerk he added
Pay what is due for the week and let him cut his stick Father
Arsene did cut his stick that evening he and his old wife suffocated
themselves with charcoal Now you see I was then a lad but that story
of Father Arsene taught me that however hard you might work it would
only profit your master who would not even thank you for it and leave
you to die on the flags in your old age So all my fire was damped and
I said to myself Whats the use of doing more than I just need If
I gain heaps of gold for M Tripeaud shall I get an atom of it
Therefore finding neither pride nor profit in my work I took a disgust
for itjust did barely enough to earn my wagesbecame an idler and a
rakeand said to myself When I get too tired of labor I can always
follow the example of Father Arsene and his wife

Whilst Jacques resigned himself to the current of these bitter thoughts
the other guests incited by the expressive pantomime of Dumoulin and
the Bacchanal Queen had tacitly agreed together and on a signal from
the Queen who leaped upon the table and threw down the bottles and
glasses with her foot all rose and shouted with the accompaniment
of Ninny Moulins rattle The storm blown Tulip the quadrille of the
Stormblown Tulip

At these joyous cries which burst suddenly like shell Jacques
started then gazing with astonishment at his guests he drew his hand
across his brow as if to chase away the painful ideas that oppressed
him and exclaimed You are right Forward the first couple Let us be
merry

In a moment the table lifted by vigorous arms was removed to the
extremity of the banquetingroom the spectators mounted upon chairs
benches and windowledges began to sing in chorus the wellknown air
of les Etudiants so as to serve instead of orchestra and accompany
the quadrille formed by Sleepinbuff the Queen Ninny Moulin and Rose
Pompon

Dumoulin having entrusted his rattle to one of the guests resumed his
extravagant Roman helmet and plume he had taken off his greatcoat
at the commencement of the feast so that he now appeared in all the
splendor of his costume His cuirass of bright scales ended in a tunic
of feathers not unlike those worn by the savages who form the oxens
escort on Mardi Gras Ninny Moulin had a huge paunch and thin legs
so that the latter moved about at pleasure in the gaping mouths of his
large top boots

Little RosePompon with her pinchedup cockedhat stuck on one side
her hands in the pockets of her trousers her bust a little inclined
forward and undulating from right to left advanced to meet
NinnyMoulin the latter danced or rather leaped towards her his
left leg bent under him his right leg stretched forward with the toe
raised and the heel gliding on the floor moreover he struck his neck
with his left hand and by a simultaneous movement stretched forth
his right as if he would have thrown dust in the eyes of his opposite
partner

This first figure met with great success and the applause was
vociferous though it was only the innocent prelude to the step of
the Stormblown Tulipwhen suddenly the door opened and one of the
waiters after looking about for an instant in search of Sleepinbuff
ran to him and whispered some words in his ear

Me cried Jacques laughing heres a go

The waiter added a few more words when Sleepinbuffs face assumed
an expression of uneasiness as he answered Very well I come
directlyand he made a step towards the door

Whats the matter Jacques asked the Bacchanal Queen in some
surprise

Ill be back immediately Some one take my place Go on with the
dance said Sleepinbuff as he hastily left the room

Something that was not put down in the bill said Dumoulin he will
soon be back

Thats it said Cephyse Now cavalier suel she added as she took
Jacquess place and the dance continued

Ninny Moulin had just taken hold of Rose Pompon with his right hand
and of the Queen with his left in order to advance between the two in
which figure he showed off his buffoonery to the utmost extent when
the door again opened and the same waiter who had called out Jacques
approached Cephyse with an air of consternation and whispered in her
ear as he had before done to Sleepinbuff

The Bacchanal Queen grew pale uttered a piercing scream and rushed out
of the room without a word leaving her guests in stupefaction

11 These atrocious words were actually spoken during the Lyons Riots




CHAPTER IV THE FAREWELL

The Bacchanal Queen following the waiter arrived at the bottom of the
staircase A coach was standing before the door of the house In it she
saw Sleepinbuff with one of the men who two hours before had been
waiting on the Place du Chatelet

On the arrival of Cephyse the man got down and said to Jacques as he
drew out his watch I give you a quarter of an hour it is all that I
can do for you my good fellow after that we must start Do not try to
escape for well be watching at the coach doors

With one spring Cephyse was in the coach Too much overcome to speak
before she now exclaimed as she took her seat by Jacques and remarked
the paleness of his countenance What is it What do they want with
you

I am arrested for debt said Jacques in a mournful voice

You exclaimed Cephyse with a heartrending sob

Yes for that bill or guarantee they made me sign And yet the man
said it was only a formthe rascal

But you have money in his hands let him take that on account

I have not a copper he sends me word by the bailiff that not having
paid the bill I shall not have the last thousand francs

Then let us go to him and entreat him to leave you at liberty It was
he who came to propose to lend you this money I know it well as he
first addressed himself to me He will have pity on you

Pitya money broker pity No no

Is there then no hope none cried Cephyse clasping her hands in
anguish But there must be something done she resumed He promised
you

You can see how he keeps his promises answered Jacques with
bitterness I signed without even knowing what I signed The bill is
overdue everything is in order it would be vain to resist They have
just explained all that to me

But they cannot keep you long in prison It is impossible

Five years if I do not pay As Ill never be able to do so my fate is
certain

Oh what a misfortune and not to be able to do anything said
Cephyse hiding her face in her hands

Listen to me Cephyse resumed Jacques in a voice of mournful
emotion since I am here I have thought only of one thingwhat is to
become of you

Never mind me

Not mind youart mad What will you do The furniture of our two
rooms is not worth two hundred francs We have squandered our money so
foolishly that we have not even paid our rent We owe three quarters
and we must not therefore count upon the furniture I leave you without
a coin At least I shall be fed in prisonbut how will you manage to
live

What is the use of grieving beforehand

I ask you how you will live tomorrow cried Jacques

I will sell my costume and some other clothes I will send you half
the money and keep the rest That will last some days

And afterwardsafterwards

Afterwardswhy thenI dont knowhow can I tell you
AfterwardsIll look about me

Hear me Cephyse resumed Jacques with bitter agony It is now that
I first know how mach I love you My heart is pressed as in a vise at
the thought of leaving you and I shudder to thinly what is to become of
you Thendrawing his hand across his forehead Jacques added You
see we have been ruined by sayingTomorrow will never comefor to
morrow has come When I am no longer with you and you have spent the
last penny of the money gained by the sale of your clothesunfit for
work as you have becomewhat will you do next Must I tell you what you
will doyou will forget me and Then as if he recoiled from his own
thoughts Jacques exclaimed with a burst of rage and despairGreat
Heaven if that were to happen I should dash my brains out against the
stones

Cephyse guessed the halftold meaning of Jacques and throwing her arms
around his neck she said to him I take another lovernever I am
like you for I now first know how much I love you

But my poor Cephysehow will you live

Well I shall take courage I will go back and dwell with my sister
as in old times we will work together and so earn our bread Ill
never go out except to visit you In a few days your creditor will
reflect that as you cant pay him ten thousand francs he may as well
set you free By that time I shall have once more acquired the habit of
working You shall see you shall seeand you also will again acquire
this habit We shall live poor but content After all we have had
plenty of amusement for six month while so many others have never known
pleasure all their lives And believe me my dear Jacques when I say
to youI shall profit by this lesson If you love me do not feel the
least uneasiness I tell you that I would rather die a hundred times
than have another lover

Kiss me said Jacques with eyes full of tears I believe youyes
I believe youand you give me back my courage both for now and
hereafter You are right we must try and get to work again or else
nothing remains but Father Arsenes bushel of charcoal for my girl
added Jacques in a low and trembling voice I have been like a drunken
man these six months and now I am getting sober and see whither we are
going Our means once exhausted I might perhaps have become a robber
and you

Oh Jacques dont talk soit is frightful interrupted Cephyse I
swear to you that I will return to my sisterthat I will workthat I
will have courage

Thus saying the Bacchanal Queen was very sincere she fully intended
to keep her word for her heart was not yet completely corrupted Misery
and want had been with her as with so many others the cause and the
excuse of her worst errors Until now she had at least followed the
instincts of her heart without regard to any base or venal motive The
cruel position in which she beheld Jacques had so far exalted her love
that she believed herself capable of resuming along with Mother Bunch
that life of sterile and incessant toil full of painful sacrifices and
privations which once had been impossible for her to bear and which
the habits of a life of leisure and dissipation would now render still
more difficult

Still the assurances which she had just given Jacques calmed his grief
and anxiety a little he had sense and feeling enough to perceive that
the fatal track which he had hitherto so blindly followed was leading
both him and Cephyse directly to infamy

One of the bailiffs having knocked at the coachdoor said to Jacques
My lad you have only five minutes leftso make haste

So courage my girlcourage said Jacques

I will you may rely upon me

Are you going upstairs again

Nooh no said Cephyse I have now a horror of this festivity

Everything is paid for and the waiter will tell them not to expect us
back They will be much astonished continued Jacques but its all
the same now

If you could only go with me to our lodging said Cephyse this
man would perhaps permit it so as not to enter SaintePelagie in that
dress

Oh he will not forbid you to accompany me but as he will be with
us in the coach we shall not be able to talk freely in his presence
Therefore let me speak reason to you for the first time in my life
Remember what I say my dear Cephyseand the counsel will apply to
me as well as to yourself continued Jacques in a grave and feeling
toneresume from today the habit of labor It may be painful
unprofitablenever minddo not hesitate for too soon will the
influence of this lesson be forgotten Byandbye it will be too late
and then you will end like so many unfortunate creatures

I understand said Cephyse blushing but I will rather die than lead
such a life

And there you will do wellfor in that case added Jacques in a deep
and hollow voice I will myself show you how to die

I count upon you Jacques answered Cephyse embracing her lover
with excited feeling then she added sorrowfully It was a kind of
presentiment when just now I felt so sad without knowing why in the
midst of all our gayetyand drank to the Cholera so that we might die
together

Well perhaps the Cholera will come resumed Jacques with a gloomy
air that would save us the charcoal which we may not even be able to
buy

I can only tell you one thing Jacques that to live and die together
you will always find me ready

Come dry your eyes said he with profound emotion Do not let us
play the children before these men

Some minutes after the coach took the direction to Jacquess lodging
where he was to change his clothes before proceeding to the debtors
prison

Let us repeat with regard to the hunchbacks sisterfor there are
things which cannot be too often repeatedthat one of the most fatal
consequences of the Inorganization of Labor is the Insufficiency of
Wages

The insufficiency of wages forces inevitably the greater number of
young girls thus badly paid to seek their means of subsistence in
connections which deprave them

Sometimes they receive a small allowance from their lovers which
joined to the produce of their labor enables them to live Sometimes
like the sempstresss sister they throw aside their work altogether
and take up their abode with the man of their choice should he be
able to support the expense It is during this season of pleasure and
idleness that the incurable leprosy of sloth takes lasting possession of
these unfortunate creatures

This is the first phase of degradation that the guilty carelessness of
Society imposes on an immense number of workwomen born with instincts
of modesty and honesty and uprightness

After a certain time they are deserted by their seducersperhaps when
they are mothers Or it may be that foolish extravagance consigns
the imprudent lover to prison and the young girl finds herself alone
abandoned without the means of subsistence

Those who have still preserved courage and energy go back to their
workbut the examples are very rare The others impelled by misery
and by habits of indolence fall into the lowest depths

And yet we must pity rather than blame them for the first and virtual
cause of their fall has been the insufficient remuneration of labor and
sudden reduction of pay

Another deplorable consequence of this inorganization is the
disgust which workmen feel for their employment in addition to the
insufficiency of their wages And this is quite conceivable for
nothing is done to render their labor attractive either by variety
of occupations or by honorary rewards or by proper care or by
remuneration proportionate to the benefits which their toil provides or
by the hope of rest after long years of industry Nothe country thinks
not cares not either for their wants or their rights

And yet to take only one example machinists and workers in foundries
exposed to boiler explosions and the contact of formidable engines
run every day greater dangers than soldiers in time of war display rare
practical sagacity and render to industryand consequently to their
countrythe most incontestable service during a long and honorable
career if they do not perish by the bursting of a boiler or have not
their limbs crushed by the iron teeth of a machine

In this last case does the workman receive a recompense equal to that
which awaits the soldiers praiseworthy but sterile couragea place in
an asylum for invalids No

What does the country care about it And if the master should happen to
be ungrateful the mutilated workman incapable of further service may
die of want in some corner

Finally in our pompous festivals of commerce do we ever assemble any
of the skillful workmen who alone have woven those admirable stuffs
forged and damascened those shining weapons chiselled those goblets of
gold and silver carved the wood and ivory of that costly furniture and
set those dazzling jewels with such exquisite art No

In the obscurity of their garrets in the midst of a miserable and
starving family hardly able to subsist on their scanty wages these
workmen have contributed at least one half to bestow those wonders
upon their country which make its wealth its glory and its pride

A minister of commerce who had the least intelligence of his high
functions and duties would require of every factory that exhibits
on these occasions the selection by vote of a certain number of
candidates amongst whom the manufacturer would point out the one that
appeared most worthy to represent the working classes in these great
industrial solemnities

Would it not be a noble and encouraging example to see the master
propose for public recompense and distinction the workman deputed by
his peers as amongst the most honest laborious and intelligent of his
profession Then one most grievous injustice would disappear and the
virtues of the workman would be stimulated by a generous and noble
ambitionhe would have an interest in doing well

Doubtless the manufacturer himself because of the intelligence he
displays the capital he risks the establishment he founds and the
good he sometimes does has a legitimate right to the prizes bestowed
upon him But why is the workman to be rigorously excluded from these
rewards which have so powerful an influence upon the people Are
generals and officers the only ones that receive rewards in the army
And when we have remunerated the captains of this great and powerful
army of industry why should we neglect the privates

Why for them is there no sign of public gratitude no kind or consoling
word from august lips Why do we not see in France a single workman
wearing a medal as a reward for his courageous industry his long and
laborious career The token and the little pension attached to it would
be to him a double recompense justly deserved But no for humble
labor that sustains the State there is only forgetfulness injustice
indifference and disdain

By this neglect of the public often aggravated by individual
selfishness and ingratitude our workmen are placed in a deplorable
situation

Some of them notwithstanding their incessant toil lead a life of
privations and die before their time cursing the social system that
rides over them Others find a temporary oblivion of their ills in
destructive intoxication Others againin great numberhaving no
interest no advantage no moral or physical inducement to do more or
better confine themselves strictly to just that amount of labor which
will suffice to earn their wages Nothing attaches them to their work
because nothing elevates honors glorifies it in their eyes They have
no defence against the reductions of indolence and if by some chance
they find means of living awhile in repose they give way by degrees to
habits of laziness and debauchery and sometimes the worst passions soil
forever natures originally willing healthy and honestand all for
want of that protecting and equitable superintendence which should have
sustained encouraged and recompensed their first worthy and laborious
tendencies

We now follow Mother Bunch who after seeking for work from the person
that usually employed her went to the Rue de Babylone to the lodge
lately occupied by Adrienne de Cardoville




CHAPTER V FLORINE

While the Bacchanal Queen and Sleepinbuff terminated so sadly the most
joyous portion of their existence the sempstress arrived at the door of
the summerhouse in the Rue de Babylone

Before ringing she dried her tears a new grief weighed upon her
spirits On quitting the tavern she had gone to the house of the person
who usually found her in work but she was told that she could not have
any because it could be done a third more cheaply by women in prison
Mother Bunch rather than lose her last resource offered to take it at
the third less but the linen had been already sent out and the
girl could not hope for employment for a fortnight to come even if
submitting to this reduction of wages One may conceive the anguish of
the poor creature the prospect before her was to die of hunger if
she would not beg or steal As for her visit to the lodge in the Rue de
Babylone it will be explained presently

She rang the bell timidly a few minutes after Florine opened the door
to her The waitingmaid was no longer adorned after the charming taste
of Adrienne on the contrary she was dressed with an affectation of
austere simplicity She wore a highnecked dress of a dark color made
full enough to conceal the light elegance of her figure Her bands of
jetblack hair were hardly visible beneath the flat border of a starched
white cap very much resembling the headdress of a nun Yet in spite
of this unornamental costume Florines pale countenance was still
admirably beautiful

We have said that placed by former misconduct at the mercy of Rodin
and M dAigrigny Florine had served them as a spy upon her mistress
notwithstanding the marks of kindness and confidence she had received
from her Yet Florine was not entirely corrupted and she often suffered
painful but vain remorse at the thought of the infamous part she was
thus obliged to perform

At the sight of Mother Bunch whom she recognizedfor she had told
her the day before of Agricolas arrest and Mdlle de Cardovilles
madnessFlorine recoiled a step so much was she moved with pity at the
appearance of the young sempstress In fact the idea of being thrown
out of work in the midst of so many other painful circumstances had
made a terrible impression upon the young workwoman the traces of
recent tears furrowed her cheekswithout her knowing it her features
expressed the deepest despairand she appeared so exhausted so weak
so overcome that Florine offered her arm to support her and said to
her kindly Pray walk in and rest yourself you are very pale and seem
to be ill and fatigued

So saying Florine led her into a small room with fireplace and carpet
and made her sit down in a tapestried armchair by the side of a good
fire Georgette and Hebe had been dismissed and Florine was left alone
in care of the house

When her guest was seated Florine said to her with an air of interest
Will you not take anything A little orange flowerwater and sugar
warm

I thank you mademoiselle said Mother Bunch with emotion so easily
was her gratitude excited by the least mark of kindness she felt too
a pleasing surprise that her poor garments had not been the cause of
repugnance or disdain on the part of Florine

I thank you mademoiselle said she but I only require a little
rest for I come from a great distance If you will permit me

Pray rest yourself as long as you like mademoiselle I am alone in
this pavilion since the departure of my poor mistresshere Florine
blushed and sighedso pray make yourself quite at home Draw near
the fireyou wilt be more comfortableand gracious how wet your feet
areplace them upon this stool

The cordial reception given by Florine her handsome face and agreeable
manners which were not those of an ordinary waitingmaid forcibly
struck Mother Bunch who notwithstanding her humble condition was
peculiarly susceptible to the influence of everything graceful
and delicate Yielding therefore to these attractions the young
sempstress generally so timid and sensitive felt herself almost at her
ease with Florine

How obliging you are mademoiselle said she in a grateful tone I am
quite confused with your kindness

I wish I could do you some greater service than offer you a place at
the fire mademoiselle Your appearance is so good and interesting

Oh mademoiselle said the other with simplicity almost in spite
of herself it does one so much good to sit by a warm fire Then
fearing in her extreme delicacy that she might be thought capable of
abusing the hospitality of her entertainer by unreasonably prolonging
her visit she added the motive that has brought me here is this
Yesterday you informed me that a young workman named Agricola Baudoin
had been arrested in this house

Alas yes mademoiselle At the moment too when my poor mistress was
about to render him assistance

I am Agricolas adopted sister resumed Mother Bunch with a slight
blush he wrote to me yesterday evening from prison He begged me to
tell his father to come here as soon as possible in order to inform
Mdlle de Cardoville that he Agricola had important matters to
communicate to her or to any person that she might send but that he
could not venture to mention them in a letter as he did not know if
the correspondence of prisoners might not be read by the governor of the
prison

What said Florine with surprise to my mistress M Agricola has
something of importance to communicate

Yes mademoiselle for up to this time Agricola is ignorant of the
great calamity that has befallen Mdlle de Cardoville

True the attack was indeed so sudden said Florine casting down her
eyes that no one could have foreseen it

It must have been so answered Mother Bunch for when Agricola saw
Mdlle de Cardoville for the first time he returned home struck with
her grace and delicacy and goodness

As were all who approached my mistress said Florine sorrowfully

This morning resumed the sewinggirl when according to Agricolas
instructions I wished to speak to his father on the subject I found
him already gone out for he also is a prey to great anxieties but
my adopted brothers letter appeared to me so pressing and to involve
something of such consequence to Mdlle de Cardoville who had shown
herself so generous towards him that I came here immediately

Unfortunately as you already know my mistress is no longer here

But is there no member of her family to whom if I could not speak
myself I might at least send word by you that Agricola has something
to communicate of importance to this young lady

It is strange said Florine reflecting and without replying Then
turning towards the sempstress she added You are quite ignorant of
the nature of these revelations

Completely so mademoiselle but I know Agricola He is all honor and
truth and you may believe whatever he affirms Besides he would have
no interest

Good gracious interrupted Florine suddenly as if struck with a
sadden light I have just remembered something When he was arrested
in a hidingplace where my mistress had concealed him I happened to
be close at hand and M Agricola said to me in a quick whisper Tell
your generous mistress that her goodness to me will not go unrewarded
and that my stay in that hidingplace may not be useless to her
That was all he could say to me for they hurried him off instantly I
confess that I saw in those words only the expression of his gratitude
and his hope of proving it one day to my mistress but now that I
connect them with the letter he has written you said Florine
reflecting

Indeed remarked Mother Bunch there is certainly some connection
between his hidingplace here and the important secrets which he wishes
to communicate to your mistress or one of her family

The hidingplace had neither been inhabited nor visited for some time
said Florine with a thoughtful air M Agricola may have found therein
something of interest to my mistress

If his letter had not appeared to me so pressing resumed the other
I should not have come hither but have left him to do so himself on
his release from prison which now thanks to the generosity of one of
his old fellowworkmen cannot be very distant But not knowing if
bail would be accepted today I have wished faithfully to perform his
instructions The generous kindness of your mistress made it my first
duty

Like all persons whose better instincts are still roused from time to
time Florine felt a sort of consolation in doing good whenever she
could with impunitythat is to say without exposing herself to the
inexorable resentments of those on whom she depended Thanks to Mother
Bunch she might now have an opportunity of rendering a great service to
her mistress She knew enough of the Princess de SaintDiziers hatred
of her niece to feel certain that Agricolas communication could not
from its very importance be made with safety to any but Mdlle de
Cardoville herself She therefore said very gravely Listen to me
mademoiselle I will give you a piece of advice which will I think be
useful to my poor mistressbut which would be very fatal to me if you
did not attend to my recommendations

How so mademoiselle said the hunchback looking at Florine with
extreme surprise

For the sake of my mistress M Agricola must confide to no one except
herself the important things he has to communicate

But if he cannot see Mdlle Adrienne may he not address himself to
some of her family

It is from her family above all that he must conceal whatever he
knows Mdlle Adrienne may recover and then M Agricola can speak to
her But should she never get well again tell your adopted brother that
it is better for him to keep his secret than to place it which would
infallibly happen at the disposal of the enemies of my mistress

I understand you mademoiselle said Mother Bunch sadly The family
of your generous mistress do not love her and perhaps persecute her

I cannot tell you more on this subject now and as regards myself let
me conjure you to obtain M Agricolas promise that he will not mention
to any one in the world the step you have taken or the advice I have
given you The happinessno not the happiness resumed Florine
bitterly as if that were a lost hope not the happinessbut the peace
of my life depends upon your discretion

Oh be satisfied said the sewinggirl both affected and amazed
by the sorrowful expression of Florines countenance I will not be
ungrateful No one in the world but Agricola shall know that I have seen
you

Thank youthank you mademoiselle cried Florine with emotion

Do you thank me said the other astonished to see the large tears
roll down her cheeks

Yes I am indebted to you for a moment of pure unmixed happiness for
I have perhaps rendered a service to my dear mistress without risking
the increase of the troubles that already overwhelm me

You are not happy then

That astonishes you but believe me whatever may be your fate I
would gladly change with you

Alas mademoiselle said the sempstress you appear to have too good
a heart for me to let you entertain such a wishparticularly now

What do you mean

I hope sincerely mademoiselle proceeded Mother Bunch with deep
sadness that you may never know what it is to want work when labor is
your only resource

Are you reduced to that extremity cried Florine looking anxiously
at the young sempstress who hung her head and made no answer She
reproached herself in her excessive delicacy with having made a
communication which resembled a complaint though it had only been wrung
from her by the thought of her dreadful situation

If it is so went on Florine I pity you with all my heart and yet I
know not if my misfortunes are not still greater than yours

Then after a moments reflection Florine exclaimed suddenly But let
me see If you are really in that position I think I can procure you
some work

Is it possible mademoiselle cried Mother Bunch I should never have
dared to ask you such a service but your generous offer commands my
confidence and may save me from destruction I will confess to you
that only this morning I was thrown out of an employment which enabled
me to earn four francs a week

Four francs a week exclaimed Florine hardly able to believe what she
heard

It was little doubtless replied the other but enough for me
Unfortunately the person who employed me has found out where it can be
done still cheaper

Four francs a week repeated Florine deeply touched by so much misery
and resignation Well I think I can introduce you to persons who will
secure you wages of at least two francs a day

I could earn two francs a day Is it possible

Yes there is no doubt of it only you will have to go out by the day
unless you chose to take a pace as servant

In my position said Mother Bunch with a mixture of timidity and
pride one has no right I know to be overnice yet I should prefer to
go out by the day and still more to remain at home if possible even
though I were to gain less

To go out is unfortunately an indispensable condition said Florine

Then I must renounce this hope answered Mother Bunch timidly not
that I refuse to go out to workbut those who do so are expected to be
decently cladand I confess without shame because there is no disgrace
in honest poverty that I have no better clothes than these

If that be all said Florine hastily they will find you the means
of dressing yourself properly

Mother Bunch looked at Florine with increasing surprise These offers
were so much above what she could have hoped and what indeed was
generally earned by needlewomen that she could hardly credit them

But resumed she with hesitation why should any one be so generous
to me mademoiselle How should I deserve such high wages

Florine started A natural impulse of the heart a desire to be useful
to the sempstress whose mildness and resignation greatly interested
her had led her to make a hasty proposition she knew at what price
would have to be purchased the advantages she proposed and she now
asked herself if the hunchback would ever accept them on such terms
But Florine had gone too far to recede and she durst not tell all She
resolved therefore to leave the future to chance and as those
who have themselves fallen are little disposed to believe in the
infallibility of others Florine said to herself that perhaps in
the desperate position in which she was Mother Bunch would not be so
scrupulous after all Therefore she said I see mademoiselle that you
are astonished at offers so much above what you usually gain but I
must tell you that I am now speaking of a pious institution founded
to procure work for deserving young women This establishment which is
called St Marys Society undertakes to place them out as servants
or by the day as needlewomen Now this institution is managed by such
charitable persons that they themselves undertake to supply an
outfit when the young women received under their protection are not
sufficiently well clothed to accept the places destined for them

This plausible explanation of Florines magnificent offers appeared to
satisfy the hearer I can now understand the high wages of which
you speak mademoiselle resumed she only I have no claim to be
patronized by the charitable persons who direct this establishment

You sufferyou are laborious and honestthose are sufficient claims
only I must tell you they will ask if you perform regularly your
religious duties

No one loves and blesses God more fervently than I do mademoiselle
said the hunchback with mild firmness but certain duties are an
affair of conscience and I would rather renounce this patronage than
be compelled

Not the least in the world Only as I told you there are very pious
persons at the head of this institution and you must not be astonished
at their questions on such a subject Make the trial at all events
what do you risk If the propositions are suitableaccept them if on
the contrary they should appear to touch your liberty of conscience
you can always refuseyour position will not be the worse for it

Mother Bunch had nothing to object to this reasoning which left her at
perfect freedom and disarmed her of all suspicion On these terms
mademoiselle said she I accept your offer and thank you with all my
heart But who will introduce me

I willtomorrow if you please

But they will perhaps desire to make some inquiries about me

The venerable Mother SaintePerpetue Superior of St Marys Convent
where the institution is established will I am sure appreciate your
good qualities without inquiry but if otherwise she will tell you and
you can easily satisfy her It is then agreedtomorrow

Shall I call upon you here mademoiselle

No as I told you before they must not know that you came here on the
part of M Agricola and a second visit might be discovered and excite
suspicion I will come and fetch you in a coach where do you live

At No 3 Rue BriseMiche as you are pleased to give yourself so
much trouble mademoiselle you have only to ask the dyer who acts as
porter to call down Mother Bunch

Mother Bunch said Florine with surprise

Yes mademoiselle answered the sempstress with a sad smile it is
the name every one gives me And you see added the hunchback unable
to restrain a tear it is because of my ridiculous infirmity to which
this name alludes that I dread going out to work among strangers
because there are so many people who laugh at one without knowing the
pain they occasion But continued she drying her eyes I have no
choice and must make up my mind to it

Florine deeply affected took the speakers hand and said to her Do
not fear Misfortunes like yours must inspire compassion not ridicule
May I not inquire for you by your real name

It is Magdalen Soliveau but I repeat mademoiselle that you had
better ask for Mother Bunch as I am hardly known by any other name

I will then be in the Rue BriseMiche tomorrow at twelve oclock

Oh mademoiselle How can I ever requite your goodness

Dont speak of it I only hope my interference may be of use to you
But of this you must judge for yourself As for M Agricola do not
answer his letter wait till he is out of prison and then tell him to
keep his secret till he can see my poor mistress

And where is the dear young lady now

I cannot tell you I do not know where they took her when she was
attacked with this frenzy You will expect me tomorrow

Yestomorrow said Mother Bunch

The convent whither Florine was to conduct the hunchback contained the
daughters of Marshal Simon and was next door to the lunatic asylum of
Dr Baleinier in which Adrienne de Cardoville was confined




CHAPTER VI MOTHER SAINTEPERPETUE

St Marys Convent whither the daughters of Marshal Simon had been
conveyed was a large old building the vast garden of which was on
the Boulevard de lHopital one of the most retired places in Paris
particularly at this period The following scenes took place on the 12th
February the eve of the fatal day on which the members of the family
of Rennepont the last descendants of the sister of the Wandering Jew
were to meet together in the Rue St Francois St Marys Convent was a
model of perfect regularity A superior council composed of influential
ecclesiastics with Father dAigrigny for president and of women of
great reputed piety at the head of whom was the Princess de Saint
Dizier frequently assembled in deliberation to consult on the means
of extending and strengthening the secret and powerful influence of this
establishment which had already made remarkable progress

Skillful combinations and deep foresight had presided at the foundation
of St Marys Convent which in consequence of numerous donations
possessed already real estate to a great extent and was daily
augmenting its acquisitions The religious community was only a pretext
but thanks to an extensive connection kept up by means of the most
decided members of the ultramontane i e highchurch party a great
number of rich orphans were placed in the convent there to receive a
solid austere religious education very preferable it was said to
the frivolous instruction which might be had in the fashionable boarding
schools infected by the corruption of the age To widows also and
lone women who happened moreover to be rich the convent offered a sure
asylum from the dangers and temptations of the world in this peaceful
retreat they enjoyed a delightful calm and secured their salvation
whilst surrounded by the most tender and affectionate attentions Nor
was this all Mother SaintePerpetue the superior of the convent
undertook in the name of the institution to procure for the faithful
who wished to preserve the interior of their houses from the depravity
of the age companions for aged ladies domestic servants or
needlewomen working by the day all selected persons whose morality
could be warranted Nothing would seem more worthy of sympathy and
encouragement than such an institution but we shall presently unveil
the vast and dangerous network of intrigue concealed under
these charitable and holy appearances The lady Superior Mother
SaintePerpetue was a tall woman of about forty years of age clad in a
stuff dress of the Carmelite tan color and wearing a long rosary at her
waist a white cap tied under the chin and a long black veil closely
encircled her thin sallow face A number of deep wrinkles had impressed
their transverse furrows in her forehead of yellow ivory her marked and
prominent nose was bent like the beak of a bird of prey her black eye
was knowing and piercing the expression of her countenance was at once
intelligent cold and firm

In the general management of the pecuniary affairs of the community
Mother SaintePerpetue would have been a match for the most cunning
attorney When women are possessed of what is called a talent for
business and apply to it their keen penetration their indefatigable
perseverance their prudent dissimulation and above all that quick
and exact insight which is natural to them the results are often
prodigious To Mother SaintePerpetue a woman of the coolest and
strongest intellect the management of the vast transactions of the
community was mere childs play No one knew better how to purchase a
depreciated property to restore it to its former value and then sell
it with advantage the price of stock the rate of exchange the current
value of the shares in the different companies were all familiar to
her she had yet never been known to make bad speculation when the
question was to invest any of the funds which were given by pious souls
for the purposes of the convent She had established in the house the
utmost order and discipline and above all an extreme economy The
constant aim of all her efforts was to enrich not herself but the
community she directed for the spirit of association when become a
collective egotism gives to corporations the faults and vices of an
individual Thus a congregation may dote upon power and money just as
a miser loves them for their own sake But it is chiefly with regard to
estates that congregations act like a single man They dream of landed
property it is their fixed idea their fruitful monomania They pursue
it with their most sincere and warm and tender wishes

The first estate is to a rising little community what the wedding
trousseau is to a young bride his first horse to a youth his first
success to a poet to a gay girl her first fiftyguinea shawl because
after all in this material age an estate gives a certain rank to a
society on the Religious Exchange and has so much the more effect upon
the simpleminded that all these partnerships in the work of salvation
which end by becoming immensely rich begin with modest poverty as
social stockintrade and charity towards their neighbors as security
reserve fund We may therefore imagine what bitter and ardent rivalry
must exist between the different congregations with regard to the
various estates that each can lay claim to with what ineffable
satisfaction the richer society crushes the poorer beneath its inventory
of houses and farms and paper securities Envy and hateful jealousy
rendered still more irritable by the leisure of a cloistered life are
the necessary consequences of such a comparison and yet nothing is less
Christianin the adorable acceptation of that divine wordnothing has
less in common with the true essential and religiously social spirit
of the gospel than this insatiable ardor to acquire wealth by every
possible meansthis dangerous avidity which is far from being atoned
for in the eyes of public opinion by a few paltry alms bestowed in
the narrow spirit of exclusion and intolerance

Mother SaintePerpetue was seated before a large cylindricalfronted
desk in the centre of an apartment simply but comfortably furnished
An excellent fire burned within the marble chimney and a soft carpet
covered the floor The superior to whom all letters addressed to the
sisters or the boarders were every day delivered had just been opening
she first according to her acknowledged right and carefully unsealing
the second without their knowing it according to a right that she
ascribed to herself of course with a view to the salvation of those
dear creatures and partly perhaps a little to make herself acquainted
with their correspondence for she also had imposed on herself the duty
of reading all letters that were sent from the convent before they were
put into the post The traces of this pious and innocent inquisition
were easily effaced for the good mother possessed a whole arsenal of
steel tools some very sharp to cut the pager imperceptibly round the
sealothers pretty little rods to be slightly heated and rolled round
the edge of the seal when the letter had been read and replaced in its
envelope so that the wax spreading as it melted might cover the first
incision Moreover from a praiseworthy feeling of justice and equality
there was in the arsenal of the good mother a little fumigator of the
most ingenious construction the damp and dissolving vapor of which was
reserved for the letters humbly and modestly secured with wafers thus
softened they yielded to the least efforts without any tearing of the
paper According to the importance of the revelations which she thus
gleaned from the writers of the letters the superior took notes more or
less extensive She was interrupted in this investigation by two gentle
taps at the bolted door Mother SaintePerpetue immediately let down the
sliding cylinder of her cabinet so as to cover the secret arsenal and
went to open the door with a grave and solemn air A lay sister came to
announce to her that the Princess de SaintDizier was waiting for her
in the parlor and that Mdlle Florine accompanied by a young girl
deformed and badly dressed was waiting at the door of the little
corridor

Introduce the princess first said Mother Sainte Perpetue And with
charming forethought she drew an armchair to the fire Mme de Saint
Dizier entered

Without pretensions to juvenile coquetry still the princess was
tastefully and elegantly dressed She wore a black velvet bonnet of the
most fashionable make a large blue cashmere shawl and a black satin
dress trimmed with sable to match the fur of her muff

To what good fortune am I again today indebted for the honor of your
visit my dear daughter said the superior graciously

A very important recommendation my dear mother though I am in a
great hurry I am expected at the house of his Eminence and have
unfortunately only a few minutes to spare I have again to speak of the
two orphans who occupied our attention so long yesterday

They continue to be kept separate according to your wish and this
separation has had such an effect upon them that I have been obliged
to send this morning for Dr Baleinier from his asylum He found much
fever joined to great depression and singular enough absolutely the
same symptoms in both cases I have again questioned these unfortunate
creatures and have been quite confounded and terrified to find them
perfect heathens

It was you see very urgent to place them in your care But to the
subject of my visit my dear mother we have just learned the unexpected
return of the soldier who brought these girls to France and was thought
to be absent for some days but he is in Paris and notwithstanding his
age a man of extraordinary boldness enterprise and energy Should he
discover that the girls are here which however is fortunately
almost impossible in his rage at seeing them removed from his impious
influence he would be capable of anything Therefore let me entreat
you my dear mother to redouble your precautions that no one may
effect an entrance by night This quarter of the town is so deserted

Be satisfied my dear daughter we are sufficiently guarded Our porter
and gardeners all well armed make a round every night on the side
of the Boulevard de lHopital The walls are high and furnished with
spikes at the more accessible places But I thank you my dear daughter
for having warned me We will redouble our precautions

Particularly this night my dear mother

Why so

Because if this infernal soldier has the audacity to attempt such a
thing it will be this very night

How do you know my dear daughter

We have information which makes us certain of it replied the
princess with a slight embarrassment which did not escape the notice
of the Superior though she was too crafty and reserved to appear to see
it only she suspected that many things were concealed from her

This night then resumed Mother SaintePerpetue we will be more
than ever on our guard But as I have the pleasure of seeing you my
dear daughter I will take the opportunity to say a word or two on the
subject of that marriage we mentioned

Yes my dear mother said the princess hastily for it is very
important The young Baron de Brisville is a man full of ardent devotion
in these times of revolutionary impiety he practises openly and is
able to render us great services He is listened to in the Chamber and
does not want for a sort of aggressive and provoking eloquence I know
not any one whose tone is more insolent with regard to his faith and
the plan is a good one for this cavalier and open manner of speaking
of sacred things raises and excites the curiosity of the indifferent
Circumstances are happily such that he may show the most audacious
violence towards our enemies without the least danger to himself
which of course redoubles his ardor as a wouldbe martyr In a
word he is altogether ours and we in return must bring about this
marriage You know besides my dear mother that he proposes to offer
a donation of a hundred thousand francs to St Marys the day he gains
possession of the fortune of Mdlle Baudricourt

I have never doubted the excellent intentions of M de Brisville
with regard to an institution which merits the sympathy of all pious
persons answered the superior discreetly but I did not expect to
meet with so many obstacles on the part of the young lady

How is that

This girl whom I always believed a most simple submissive timid
almost idiotic personinstead of being delighted with this proposal of
marriage asks time to consider

It is really pitiable

She opposes to me an inert resistance It is in vain for me to speak
severely and tell her that having no parents or friends and being
absolutely confided to my care she ought to see with my eyes hear with
my ears and when I affirm that this union is suitable in all respects
give her adhesion to it without delay or reflection

No doubt It would be impossible to speak more sensibly

She answers that she wishes to see M de Brisville and know his
character before being engaged

It is absurdsince you undertake to answer for his morality and
esteem this a proper marriage

Therefore I remarked to Mdlle Baudricourt this morning that till
now I had only employed gentle persuasion but that if she forced me
to it I should be obliged in her own interest to act with rigor to
conquer so much obstinacy that I should have to separate her from her
companions and to confine her closely in a cell until she made up her
mind after all to consult her own happiness andmarry an honorable
man

And these menaces my dear mother

Will I hope have a good effect She kept up a correspondence with
an old schoolfriend in the country I have put a stop to this for it
appeared to me dangerous She is now under my sole influence and I hope
we shall attain our ends but you see my dear daughter it is never
without crosses and difficulties that we succeed in doing good

And I feel certain that M de Brisville will even go beyond his first
promise and I will pledge myself for him that should he marry Mdlle
Baudricourt

You know my dear daughter said the superior interrupting the
princess that if I were myself concerned I would refuse everything
but to give to this institution is to give to Heaven and I cannot
prevent M de Brisville from augmenting the amount of his good works
Then you see we are exposed to a sad disappointment

What is that my dear mother

The Sacred Heart Convent disputes an estate with us that would have
suited us exactly Really some people are quite insatiable I gave the
lady superior my opinion upon it pretty freely

She told me as much answered Madame de SaintDizier and laid the
blame on the steward

Oh so you see her my dear daughter exclaimed the superior with an
air of great surprise

I met her at the bishops answered Madame de SaintDizier with a
slight degree of hesitation that Mother SaintePerpetue did not appear
to notice

I really do not know resumed the latter why our establishment
should excite so violently the jealousy of the Sacred Heart There is
not an evil report that they have not spread with regard to St Marys
Convent Certain persons are always offended by the success of their
neighbors

Come my dear mother said the princess in a conciliating tone we
must hope that the donation of M de Brisville will enable you to outbid
the Sacred Heart This marriage will have a double advantage you see
my dear mother it will place a large fortune at the disposal of a man
who is devoted to us and who will employ it as we wish and it will
also greatly increase the importance of his position as our defender
by the addition to his income of 100000 francs a year We shall have at
length an organ worthy of our cause and shall no longer be obliged to
look for defenders amongst such people as that Dumoulin

There is great power and much learning in the writings of the man you
name It is the style of a Saint Bernard in wrath at the impiety of the
age

Alas my dear mother if you only knew what a strange Saint Bernard
this Dumoulin is But I will not offend your ears all I can tell you
is that such defenders would compromise the most sacred cause Adieu
my dear mother pray redouble your precautions tonightthe return of
this soldier is alarming

Be quite satisfied my dear daughter Oh I forgot Mdlle Florine
begged me to ask you a favor It is to let her enter your service You
know the fidelity she displayed in watching your unfortunate niece I
think that by rewarding her in this way you will attach her to you
completely and I shall feel grateful on her account

If you interest yourself the least in the world in Florine my dear
mother the thing is done I will take her into my service And now it
strikes me she may be more useful to me than I thought

A thousand thanks my dear daughter for such obliging attention to my
request I hope we shall soon meet again The day after tomorrow at
two oclock we have a long conference with his Eminence and the Bishop
do not forget

No my dear mother I shall take care to be exact Only pray redouble
your precautions tonight for fear of a great scandal

After respectfully kissing the hand of the superior the princess
went out by the great door which led to an apartment opening on the
principal staircase Some minutes after Florine entered the room by
another way The superior was seated and Florine approached her with
timid humility

Did you meet the Princess de SaintDizier asked Mother Sainte
Perpetue

No mother I was waiting in the passage where the windows look out on
the garden

The princess takes you into her service from today said the
superior

Florine made a movement of sorrowful surprise and exclaimed Me
mother but

I asked her in your name and you have only to accept answered the
other imperiously

But mother I had entreated you

I tell you that you accept the offer said the superior in so firm
and positive a tone that Florine cast down her eyes and replied in a
low voice I accept

It is in M Rodins name that I give you this order

I thought so mother replied Florine sadly on what conditions am I
to serve the princess

On the same conditions as those on which you served her niece

Florine shuddered and said I am then to make frequent secret reports
with regard to the princess

You will observe you will remember and you will give an account

Yes my mother

You will above all direct your attention to the visits that the
princess may receive from the lady superior of the Sacred Heart You
must try and listenfor we have to preserve the princess from evil
influences

I will obey my mother

You will also try and discover why two young orphans have been brought
hither and recommended to be severely treated by Madame Grivois the
confidential waitingwoman of the princess

Yes mother

Which must not prevent you from remembering anything else that may be
worthy of remark Tomorrow I will give you particular instructions upon
another subject

It is well mother

If you conduct yourself in a satisfactory manner and execute
faithfully the instructions of which I speak you will soon leave the
princess to enter the service of a young bride it will be an excellent
and lasting situation always on the same conditions It is therefore
perfectly understood that you have asked me to recommend you to Madame
de Saint Dizier

Yes mother I shall remember

Who is this deformed young girl that accompanies you

A poor creature without any resources very intelligent and with an
education above her class she works at her needle but is at present
without employment and reduced to the last extremity I have made
inquiries about her this morning she has an excellent character

She is ugly and deformed you say

She has an interesting countenance but she is deformed

The superior appeared pleased at this information and added after a
moments reflection She appears intelligent

Very intelligent

And is absolutely without resources

Yes without any

Is she pious

She does not practice

No matter said the superior to herself if she be intelligent that
will suffice Then she resumed aloud Do you know if she is a good
workwoman

I believe so mother

The superior rose took a register from a shelf appeared to be looking
into it attentively for some time and then said as she replaced it
Fetch in this young girl and go and wait for me in the pressroom

Deformedintelligentclever at her needle said the superior
reflecting she will excite no suspicion We must see

In about a minute Florine returned with Mother Bunch whom she
introduced to the superior and then discreetly withdrew The young
sempstress was agitated trembling and much troubled for she could as
it were hardly believe a discovery which she had chanced to make during
Florines absence It was not without a vague sense of terror that the
hunchback remained alone with the lady superior




CHAPTER VII THE TEMPTATION

This was the cause of Mother Bunchs emotion Florine when she went to
see the superior had left the young sempstress in a passage supplied
with benches and forming a sort of antechamber on the first story
Being alone the girl had mechanically approached a window which
looked upon the convent garden shut in by a half demolished wall and
terminating at one end in an open paling This wall was connected with
a chapel that was still building and bordered on the garden of a
neighboring house The sewinggirl at one of the windows on the ground
floor of this housea grated window still more remarkable by the sort
of tentlike awning above itbeheld a young female with her eyes fixed
upon the convent making signs with her hand at once encouraging and
affectionate From the window where she stood Mother Bunch could not
see to whom these signs were addressed but she admired the rare beauty
of the telegrapher the brilliancy of her complexion the shining
blackness of her large eyes the sweet and benevolent smile which
lingered on her lips There was no doubt some answer to her graceful
and expressive pantomime for by a movement full of elegance the girl
laid her left hand on her bosom and waved her right which seemed to
indicate that her heart flew towards the place on which she kept her
eyes One faint sunbeam piercing the clouds came at this moment to
play with the tresses of the pale countenance which now held close
to the bars of the window was suddenly as it were illuminated by
the dazzling reflection of her splendid golden hair At sight of that
charming face set in its admirable frame of red curls Mother Bunch
started involuntarily the thought of Mdlle de Cardoville crossed her
mind and she felt persuaded nor was she indeed mistaken that
the protectress of Agricola was before her On thus beholding in
that gloomy asylum this young lady so marvellously beautiful and
remembering the delicate kindness with which a few days before she had
received Agricola in her luxurious little palace of dazzling splendor
the workgirl felt her heart sink within her She believed Adrienne
insane and yet as she looked attentively at her it seemed as if
intelligence and grace animated that adorable countenance Suddenly
Mdlle de Cardoville laid her fingers upon her lips blew a couple of
kisses in the direction towards which she had been looking and all
at once disappeared Reflecting upon the important revelations which
Agricola had to make to Mdlle de Cardoville Mother Bunch regretted
bitterly that she had no means of approaching her for she felt sure
that if the young lady were mad the present was a lucid interval
She was yet absorbed in these uneasy reflections when she saw Florine
return accompanied by one of the nuns Mother Bunch was obliged
therefore to keep silence with regard to the discovery she had made
and soon after she found herself in the superiors presence This
latter after a rapid and searching examination of the countenance of
the young workwoman judged her appearance so timid gentle and honest
that she thought she might repose full confidence in the information
given by Florine

My dear daughter said Mother SaintePerpetue in an affectionate
voice Florine has told me in what a cruel situation you are placed Is
it true that you are entirely without work

Alas yes madame

Call me mother my dear daughter that name is dearer to me and it is
the rule of our house I need not ask you what are your principles

I have always lived honestly by my labor mother answered the girl
with a simplicity at once dignified and modest

I believe you my dear daughter and I have good reasons for so doing
We must thank the Lord who has delivered you from temptation but tell
meare you clever at your trade

I do my best mother and have always satisfied my employers If you
please to try me you will be able to judge

Your affirmation is sufficient my dear daughter You prefer I think
to go out by the day

Mdlle Florine told me mother that I could not have work at home

Why nonot for the present my child If hereafter an opportunity
should offer I will think of it Just now I have this to propose to
you A very respectable old lady has asked me to recommend to her a
needlewoman by the day introduced by me you will certainly suit
her The institution will undertake to clothe you becomingly and this
advance we shall retain by degrees out of your wages for you will look
to us for payment We propose to give you two francs a day does that
appear to you sufficient

Oh mother it is much more than I could have expected

You will moreover only be occupied from nine oclock in the morning
till six in the evening you will thus have still some off hours of
which you might make use You see the situation is not a hard one

Oh quite the contrary mother

I must tell you first of all with whom the institution intends to
place you It is a widow lady named Mme de Bremant a person of the
most steadfast piety In her house I hope you will meet with none but
excellent examples If it should be otherwise you can come and inform
me

How so mother said the sewinggirl with surprise

Listen to me my dear daughter said Mother SaintePerpetue in a
tone ever more and more affectionate the institution of St Mary has
a double end in view You will perfectly understand that if it is our
duty to give to masters and mistresses every possible security as to the
morality of the persons that we place in their families we are likewise
bound to give to the persons that we so place out every possible
security as to the morality of their employers

Nothing can be more just and of a wiser foresight mother

Naturally my dear daughter for even as a servant of bad morals may
cause the utmost trouble in a respectable family so the bad conduct of
a master or mistress may have the most baneful influence on the persons
who serve them or who come to work in their houses Now it is to offer
a mutual guarantee to good masters and honest servants that we have
founded this institution

Oh madame cried Mother Bunch with simplicity such designs merit
the thanks and blessings of every one

And blessings do not fail us my dear daughter because we perform our
promises Thus an interesting workwomansuch as you for exampleis
placed with persons that we suppose irreproachable Should she however
perceive on the part of her employers or on that of the persons who
frequent the house any irregularity of morals any tendency to what
would offend her modesty or shock her religious principles she should
immediately give us a detailed account of the circumstances that have
caused her alarm Nothing can be more properdont you think so

Yes mother answered Mother Bunch timidly for she began to find
this provision somewhat singular

Then resumed the superior if the case appears a serious one we
exhort our befriended one to observe what passes more attentively so
as to convince herself whether she had really reason to be alarmed
She makes a new report to us and should it confirm our first fears
faithful to our pious guardianship we withdraw her instantly from the
house Moreover as the majority of our young people notwithstanding
their innocence and virtue have not always sufficient experience to
distinguish what may be injurious to their souls health we think it
greatly to their interest that they should confide to us once a week as
a child would to her mother either in person or by letter whatever has
chanced to occur in the house in which we have placed them Then we can
judge for them whether to withdraw them or not We have already about
a hundred persons companions to ladies young women in shops servants
and needlewomen by the day whom we have placed in a great number
of families and for the interest of all we have every reason to
congratulate ourselves on this mode of proceeding You understand me do
you not my dear daughter

Yesyes mother said the sempstress more and more embarrassed She
had too much uprightness and sagacity not to perceive that this plan of
mutually insuring the morality of masters and servants resembled a vast
spy system brought home to the domestic hearth and carried on by the
members of the institution almost without their knowledge for it would
have been difficult to disguise more skillfully the employment for which
they were trained

If I have entered into these long details my dear daughter resumed
Mother SaintePerpetue taking the hearers silence for consent it
is that you may not suppose yourself obliged to remain in the house in
question if against our expectation you should not find there holy
and pious examples I believe Mme de Bremonts house to be a pure and
godly place only I have heard though I will not believe it that Mme
de Bremonts daughter Mme de Noisy who has lately come to reside with
her is not so exemplary in her conduct as could be desired that she
does not fulfil regularly her religious duties and that during the
absence of her husband who is now in America she receives visits
unfortunately too frequent from one M Hardy a rich manufacturer

At the name of Agricolas master Mother Bunch could not suppress a
movement of surprise and also blushed slightly The superior
naturally mistook this surprise and confusion for a proof of the modest
susceptibility of the young sempstress and added I have told you all
this my dear daughter that you might be on your guard I have even
mentioned reports that I believe to be completely erroneous for the
daughter of Mme de Bremont has always had such good examples before
her that she cannot have so forgotten them But being in the house from
morning to night you will be able better than any one to discover if
these reports have any foundation in truth Should it unfortunately so
turn out my dear daughter you would come and confide to me all the
circumstances that have led you to such a conclusion and should I
then agree in your opinion I would withdraw you instantly from the
housefor the piety of the mother would not compensate sufficiently for
the deplorable example of the daughters conduct For as soon as you
form part of the institution I am responsible for your salvation and
in case your delicacy should oblige you to leave Mme de Bremonts as
you might be some time without employment the institution will allow
you if satisfied with your zeal and conduct one franc a day till we
could find you another place You see my dear daughter that you have
everything to gain with us It is therefore agreed that the day after
tomorrow you go to Mme de Bremonts Mother Bunch found herself in a
very hard position Sometimes she thought that her first suspicions were
confirmed and notwithstanding her timidity her pride felt hurt at the
supposition that because they knew her poor they should believe
her capable of selling herself as a spy for the sake of high wages
Sometimes on the contrary her natural delicacy revolted at the idea
that a woman of the age and condition of the superior could descend to
make a proposition so disgraceful both to the accepter and the proposer
and she reproached herself with her first doubts and asked herself if
the superior had not wished to try her before employing her to see if
her probity would enable her to resist a comparatively brilliant offer
Mother Bunch was naturally so inclined to think well of every one that
she made up her mind to this last conclusion saying to herself that
if after all she were deceived it would be the least offensive mode
of refusing these unworthy offers With a movement exempt from all
haughtiness but expressive of natural dignity the young workman raised
her head which she had hitherto held humbly cast down looked the
superior full in the face that the latter might read in her countenance
the sincerity of her words and said to her in a slightly agitated
voice forgetting this time to call her mother Ah madame I cannot
blame you for exposing me to such a trial You see that I am very poor
and I have yet done nothing to command your confidence But believe
me poor as I am I would never stoop to so despicable an action as
that which you have thought fit to propose to me no doubt to assure
yourself by my refusal that I am worthy of your kindness No no
madameI could never bring myself to be a spy at any price

She pronounced these last words with so much animation that her cheeks
became slightly flushed The superior had too much tact and experience
not to perceive the sincerity of the words Thinking herself lucky that
the young girl should put this construction upon the affair she smiled
upon her affectionately and stretched out her arms to her saying It
is well my dear daughter Come and embrace me

MotherI am really confusedwith so much kindness

Noyou deserve ityour words are so full of truth and honesty Only
be persuaded that I have not put you to any trial because there is no
resemblance between the act of a spy and the marks of filial confidence
that we require of our members for the sake of watching over their
morals But certain personsI see you are of the number my dear
daughterhave such fixed principles and so mature a judgment that
they can do without our advice and guardianship and can appreciate
themselves whatever might be dangerous to their salvation I will
therefore leave the entire responsibility to yourself and only ask you
for such communications as you may think proper to make

Oh madame how good you are said poor Mother Bunch for she was
not aware of the thousand devices of the monastic spirit and thought
herself already sure of gaining just wages honorably

It is not goodnessbut justice answered Mother SaintePerpetue
whose tone was becoming more and more affectionate Too much tenderness
cannot be shown to pious young women like you whom poverty has only
purified because they have always faithfully observed the divine laws

Mother

One last question my child how many times a month do you approach the
Lords table

Madame replied the hunchback I have not taken the sacrament since
my first communion eight years ago I am hardly able by working every
day and all day long to earn my bread I have no time

Gracious heaven cried the superior interrupting and clasping her
hands with all the signs of painful astonishment Is it possible you
do not practise

Alas madame I tell you that I have no time answered Mother Bunch
looking disconcertedly at Mother SaintPerpetue

I am grieved my dear daughter said the latter sorrowfully after a
moments silence but I told you that as we place our friends in none
but pious houses so we are asked to recommend none but pious persons
who practise their religious duties It is one of the indispensable
conditions of our institution It will therefore to my great regret
be impossible for me to employ you as I had hoped If hereafter you
should renounce your present indifference to those duties we will then
see

Madame said Mother Bunch her heart swollen with tears for she
was thus forced to abandon a cheering hope I beg pardon for having
detained you so longfor nothing

It is I my dear daughter who regret not to be able to attach you
to the institution but I am not altogether hopeless that a person
already so worthy of interest will one day deserve by her piety the
lasting support of religious people Adieu my dear daughter go in
peace and may God be merciful to you until the day that you return
with your whole heart to Him

So saying the superior rose and conducted her visitor to the door
with all the forms of the most maternal kindness At the moment she
crossed the threshold she said to her Follow the passage go down
a few steps and knock at the second door on the right hand It is the
pressroom and there you will find Florine She will show you the way
out Adieu my dear daughter

As soon as Mother Bunch had left the presence of the superior her
tears until now restrained gushed forth abundantly Not wishing to
appear before Florine and the nuns in this state she stopped a moment
at one of the windows to dry her eyes As she looked mechanically
towards the windows of the next house where she fancied she had seen
Adrienne de Cardoville she beheld the latter come from a door in the
building and advance rapidly towards the open paling that separated the
two gardens At the same instant and to her great astonishment Mother
Bunch saw one of the two sisters whose disappearance had caused the
despair of Dagobert with pale and dejected countenance approach the
fence that separated her from Mdlle de Cardoville trembling with fear
and anxiety as though she dreaded to be discovered




CHAPTER VIII MOTHER BUNCH AND MDLLE DE CARDOVILLE

Agitated attentive uneasy leaning from one of the conventwindows
the workgirl followed with her eyes the movements of Mdlle de
Cardoville and Rose Simon whom she so little expected to find together
in such a place The orphan approaching close to the fence which
separated the nunnerygarden from that of Dr Baleiniers asylum spoke
a few words to Adrienne whose features at once expressed astonishment
indignation and pity At this juncture a nun came running and
looking right and left as though anxiously seeking for some one then
perceiving Rose who timidly pressed close to the paling she seized her
by the arm and seemed to scold her severely and notwithstanding some
energetic words addressed to her by Mdlle de Cardoville she hastily
carried off the orphan who with weeping eyes turned several times to
look back at Adrienne whilst the latter after showing the interest
she took in her by expressive gestures turned away suddenly as if to
conceal her tears

The passage in which the witness stood during this touching scene was
situated on the first story The thought immediately occurred to the
sempstress to go down to the groundfloor and try to get into the
garden so that she might have an opportunity of speaking to the fair
girl with the golden hair and ascertaining if it were really Mdlle de
Cardoville to whom if she found her in a lucid interval she might say
that Agricola had things of the greatest importance to communicate but
that he did not know how to inform her of them The day was advancing
the sun was on its decline and fearing that Florine would be tired
of waiting for her Mother Bunch made haste to act with a light step
listening anxiously as she went she reached the end of the passage
where three or four stairs led down to the landingplace of the press
room and then formed a spiral descent to the groundfloor Hearing
voices in the pressroom the sempstress hastened down the stairs and
found herself in a long passage in the centre of which was a glass
door opening on that part of the garden reserved for the superior
A path bordered by a high boxhedge sheltered her from the gaze of
curious eyes and she crept along it till she reached the open paling
which at this spot separated the conventgarden from that of Dr
Baleiniers asylum She saw Mdlle de Cardoville a few steps from her
seated and with her arm resting upon a rustic bench The firmness
of Adriennes character had for a moment been shaken by fatigue
astonishment fright despair on the terrible night when she had
been taken to the asylum by Dr Baleinier and the latter taking a
diabolical advantage of her weakness and despondency had succeeded
for a moment in making her doubt of her own sanity But the calm which
necessarily follows the most painful and violent emotions combined
with the reflection and reasoning of a clear and subtle intellect soon
convinced Adrienne of the groundlessness of the fears inspired by the
crafty doctor She no longer believed that it could even be a mistake on
the part of the man of science She saw clearly in the conduct of this
man in which detestable hypocrisy was united with rare audacity and
both served by a skill no less remarkable that M Baleinier was in
fact the blind instrument of the Princess de SaintDizier From
that moment she remained silent and calm but full of dignity not a
complaint not a reproach was allowed to pass her lips She waited Yet
though they left her at liberty to walk about carefully depriving her
of all means of communicating with any one beyond the walls Adriennes
situation was harsh and painful particularly for her who so loved to
be surrounded by pleasant and harmonious objects She felt however
that this situation could not last long She did not thoroughly
understand the penetration and action of the laws but her good sense
taught her that a confinement of a few days under the plea of some
appearances of insanity more or less plausible in themselves might
be attempted and even executed with impunity but that it could not be
prolonged beyond certain limits because after all a young lady of
her rank in society could not disappear suddenly from the world without
inquiries being made on the subjectand the pretence of a sudden attack
of madness would lead to a serious investigation Whether true or false
this conviction had restored Adrienne to her accustomed elasticity and
energy of character And yet she sometimes in vain asked herself the
cause of this attempt on her liberty She knew too well the Princess de
SaintDizier to believe her capable of acting in this way without
a certain end in view and merely for the purpose of inflicting a
momentary pang In this Mdlle de Cardoville was not deceived Father
dAigrigny and the princess were both persuaded that Adrienne better
informed than she wished to acknowledge knew how important it was for
her to find herself in the house in the Rue SaintFrancois on the 13th
of February and was determined to maintain her rights In shutting up
Adrienne as mad it was intended to strike a fatal blow at her future
prospects but this last precaution was useless for Adrienne though
upon the true scent of the familysecret they lead wished to conceal
from her had not yet entirely penetrated its meaning for want of
certain documents which had been lost or hidden

Whatever had been the motives for the odious conduct of Mdlle de
Cardovilles enemies she was not the less disgusted at it No one could
be more free from hatred or revenge than was this generous young girl
but when she thought of all the sufferings which the Princess de Saint
Dizier Abbe dAigrigny and Dr Baleinier had occasioned her she
promised herself not reprisals but a striking reparation If it were
refused her she was resolved to combatwithout truce or restthis
combination of craft hypocrisy and cruelty not from resentment for
what she had endured but to preserve from the same torments other
innocent victims who might not like her be able to struggle and
defend themselves Adrienne still under the painful impression which
had been caused by her interview with Rose Simon was leaning against
one of the sides of the rustic bench on which she was seated and held
her left hand over her eyes She had laid down her bonnet beside her
and the inclined position of her head brought the long golden curls
over her fair shining cheeks In this recumbent attitude so full of
careless grace the charming proportions of her figure were seen to
advantage beneath a watered green dress while a broad collar fastened
with a rosecolored satin bow and fine lace cuffs prevented too strong
a contrast between the hue of her dress and the dazzling whiteness of
the swanlike neck and Raphaelesque hands imperceptibly veined with
tiny azure lines Over the high and wellformed instep were crossed the
delicate strings of a little black satin shoefor Dr Baleinier had
allowed her to dress herself with her usual taste and elegance of
costume was not with Adrienne a mark of coquetry but of duty towards
herself because she had been made so beautiful At sight of this young
lady whose dress and appearance she admired in all simplicity without
any envious or bitter comparison with her own poor clothes and deformity
of person Mother Bunch said immediately to herself with the good sense
and sagacity peculiar to her that it was strange a mad woman should
dress so sanely and gracefully It was therefore with a mixture of
surprise and emotion that she approached the fence which separated her
from Adriennereflecting however that the unfortunate girl might
still be insane and that this might turn out to be merely a lucid
interval And now with a timid voice but loud enough to be heard
Mother Bunch in order to assure herself of Adriennes identity said
whilst her heart beat fast Mdlle de Cardoville

Who calls me said Adrienne On hastily raising her head and
perceiving the hunchback she could not suppress a slight cry of
surprise almost fright For indeed this poor creature pale deformed
miserably clad thus appearing suddenly before her must have inspired
Mdlle de Cardoville so passionately fond of grace and beauty with a
feeling of repugnance if not of terrorand these two sentiments were
both visible in her expressive countenance

The other did not perceive the impression she had made Motionless with
her eyes fixed and her hands clasped in a sort of adoring admiration
she gazed on the dazzling beauty of Adrienne whom she had only half
seen through the grated window All that Agricola had told her of the
charms of his protectress appeared to her a thousand times below the
reality and never even in her secret poetic visions had she dreamed
of such rare perfection Thus by a singular contrast a feeling of
mutual surprise came over these two girlsextreme types of deformity
and beauty wealth and wretchedness After rendering as it were this
involuntary homage to Adrienne Mother Bunch advanced another step
towards the fence

What do you want cried Mdlle de Cardoville rising with a
sentiment of repugnance which could not escape the workgirls notice
accordingly she held down her head timidly and said in a soft voice
I beg your pardon madame to appear so suddenly before you But
moments are precious I come from Agricola

As she pronounced these words the sempstress raised her eyes anxiously
fearing that Mdlle de Cardoville might have forgotten the name of
the workman But to her great surprise and joy the fears of Adrienne
seemed to diminish at the name of Agricola and approaching the fence
she looked at the speaker with benevolent curiosity

You come from M Agricola Baudoin said she Who are you

His adopted sister madamea poor needlewoman who lives in the same
house

Adrienne appeared to collect her thoughts and said smiling kindly
after a moments silence It was you then who persuaded M Agricola to
apply to me to procure him bail

Oh madame do you remember

I never forget anything that is generous and noble M Agricola was
much affected when he spoke of your devotion I remember it well it
would be strange if I did not But how came you here in this convent

They told me that I should perhaps be able to get some occupation here
as I am out of work Unfortunately I have been refused by the lady
superior

And how did you recognize me

By your great beauty madame of which Agricola had told me

Or rather by this said Adrienne smiling as she lifted with the tips
of her rosy fingers one end of a long silky ringlet of golden hair

You must pardon Agricola madame said the sewing girl with one of
those half smiles which rarely settled on her lips he is a poet and
omitted no single perfection in the respectful and admiring description
which he gave of his protectress

And what induced you to come and speak to me

The hope of being useful to you madame You received Agricola with so
much goodness that I have ventured to go shares in his gratitude

You may well venture to do so my dear girl said Adrienne with
ineffable grace until now unfortunately I have only been able to
serve your adopted brother by intention

As they exchanged these words Adrienne and Mother Bunch looked at each
other with increasing surprise The latter was first of all astonished
that a person who passed for mad should express herself as Adrienne
did next she was amazed at the ease and freedom with which she herself
answered the questions of Mdlle de Cardovillenot knowing that the
latter was endowed with the precious privilege of lofty and benevolent
natures to draw out from those who approached her whatever sympathized
with herself On her side Mdlle de Cardoville was deeply moved and
astonished to hear this young lowborn girl dressed almost like a
beggar express herself in terms selected with so much propriety The
more she looked at her the more the feeling of repugnance she at
first experienced wore off and was at length converted into quite the
opposite sentiment With that rapid and minute power of observation
natural to women she remarked beneath the black crape of Mother Bunchs
cap the smoothness and brilliancy of the fair chestnut hair She
remarked too the whiteness of the long thin hand though it displayed
itself at the end of a patched and tattered sleevean infallible proof
that care and cleanliness and selfrespect were at least struggling
against symptoms of fearful distress Adrienne discovered also in the
pale and melancholy features in the expression of the blue eyes at
once intelligent mild and timid a soft and modest dignity which made
one forget the deformed figure Adrienne loved physical beauty and
admired it passionately but she had too superior a mind too noble a
soul too sensitive a heart not to know how to appreciate moral beauty
even when it beamed from a humble and suffering countenance Only this
kind of appreciation was new to Mdlle de Cardoville until now her
large fortune and elegant habits had kept her at a distance from persons
of Mother Bunchs class After a short silence during which the fair
patrician and the poor workgirl had closely examined each other
Adrienne said to the other It is easy I think to explain the cause
of our mutual astonishment You have no doubt discovered that I speak
pretty reasonably for a mad womanif they have told you I am one And
I added Mdlle de Cardoville in a tone of respectful commiseration
find that the delicacy of your language and manners so singularly
contrast with the position in which you appear to be that my surprise
must be even greater than yours

Ah madame cried Mother Bunch with a welling forth of such deep and
sincere joy that the tears started to her eyes is it truethey have
deceived meyou are not mad Just now when I beheld you so kind
and beautiful when I heard the sweet tone of your voice I could not
believe that such a misfortune had happened to you But alas how is it
then madame that you are in this place

Poor child said Adrienne touched by the affectionate interest of
this excellent creature and how is it that you with such a heart and
head should be in such distress But be satisfied I shall not always
be hereand that will suffice to tell you that we shall both resume
the place which becomes us Believe me I shall never forget how in
spite of the painful ideas which must needs occupy your mind on seeing
yourself deprived of workyour only resourceyou have still thought of
coming to me and of trying to serve me You may indeed be eminently
useful to me and I am delighted at it for then I shall owe you
muchand you shall see how I will take advantage of my gratitude said
Adrienne with a sweet smile But resumed she before talking
of myself let us think of others Is your adopted brother still in
prison

By this time madame I hope he has obtained his freedom thanks to the
generosity of one of his comrades His father went yesterday to offer
bail for him and they promised that he should be released today But
from his prison he wrote to me that he had something of importance to
reveal to you

To me

Yes madame Should Agricola be released immediately by what means can
he communicate with you

He has secrets to tell me resumed Mdlle de Cardoville with an air
of thoughtful surprise I seek in vain to imagine what they can be but
so long as I am confined in this house and secluded from every one M
Agricola must not think of addressing himself directly or indirectly
to me He must wait till I am at liberty but that is not all he must
deliver from that convent two poor children who are much more to be
pitied than I am The daughters of Marshal Simon are detained there
against their will

You know their name madame

When M Agricola informed me of their arrival in Paris he told me they
were fifteen years old and that they resembled each other exactlyso
that the day before yesterday when I took my accustomed walk and
observed two poor little weeping faces come close to the windows of
their separate cells one on the ground floor the other on the first
story a secret presentiment told me that I saw in them the orphans
of whom M Agricola had spoken and in whom I already took a lively
interest as being my relations

They are your relations madame then

Yes certainly So not being able to do more I tried to express by
signs how much I felt for them Their tears and the sadness of their
charming faces sufficiently told me that they were prisoners in the
convent as I am myself in this house

Oh I understand madamethe victim of the animosity of your family

Whatever may be my fate I am much less to be pitied than these two
children whose despair is really alarming Their separation is what
chiefly oppresses them By some words that one of them just now said to
me I see that they are like me the victims of an odious machination
But thanks to you it will be possible to save them Since I have been
in this house I have had no communication with any one they have not
allowed me pen or paper so it is impossible to write Now listen to me
attentively and we shall be able to defeat an odious persecution

Oh speak speak madame

The soldier who brought these orphans to France the father of M
Agricola is still in town

Yes madame Oh if you only knew his fury his despair when on his
return home he no longer found the children that a dying mother had
confided to him

He must take care not to act with the least violence It would ruin
all Take this ring said Adrienne drawing it from her finger and
give it to him He must go instantlyare you sure that you can remember
a name and address

Oh yes madame Be satisfied on that point Agricola only mentioned
your name once and I have not forgotten it There is a memory of the
heart

I perceive it my dear girl Remember then the name of the Count de
Montbron

The Count de MontbronI shall not forget

He is one of my good old friends and lives on the Place Vendome No
7

Place Vendome No 7I shall remember

M Agricolas father must go to him this evening and if he is not at
home wait for his coming in He must ask to speak to him as if from
me and send him this ring as a proof of what he says Once with him he
must tell him allthe abduction of the girls the name of the convent
where they are confined and my own detention as a lunatic in the asylum
of Dr Baleinier Truth has an accent of its own which M de Montbron
will recognize He is a man of much experience and judgment and
possessed of great influence He will immediately take the necessary
steps and tomorrow or the day after these poor orphans and myself
will be restored to libertyall thanks to you But moments are
precious we might be discovered make haste dear child

At the moment of drawing back Adrienne said to Mother Bunch with so
sweet a smile and affectionate a tone that it was impossible not to
believe her sincere M Agricola told me that I had a heart like yours
I now understand how honorable how flattering those words were for me
Pray give me your hand added Mdlle de Cardoville whose eyes were
filling with tears and passing her beautiful hand through an opening
in the fence she offered it to the other The words and the gesture
of the fair patrician were full of so much real cordiality that the
sempstress with no false shame placed tremblingly her own poor thin
hand in Adriennes while the latter with a feeling of pious respect
lifted it spontaneously to her lips and said Since I cannot embrace
you as my sister let me at least kiss this hand ennobled by labor

Suddenly footsteps were heard in the garden of Dr Baleinier Adrienne
withdrew abruptly and disappeared behind some trees saying Courage
memory and hope

All this had passed so rapidly that the young workwoman had no time
to speak or move tears sweet tears flowed abundantly down her pale
cheeks For a young lady like Adrienne de Cardoville to treat her as a
sister to kiss her hand to tell her that she was proud to resemble
her in hearther a poor creature vegetating in the lowest abyss
of miserywas to show a spirit of fraternal equality divine as the
gospel words

There are words and impressions which make a noble soul forget years of
suffering and which as by a sudden flash reveal to it something of
its own worth and grandeur Thus it was with the hunchback Thanks to
this generous speech she was for a moment conscious of her own value
And though this feeling was rapid as it was ineffable she clasped
her hands and raised her eyes to heaven with an expression of fervent
gratitude for if the poor sempstress did not practise to use the
jargon of ultramontane cant no one was more richly endowed with that
deep religious sentiment which is to mere dogmas what the immensity of
the starry heaven is to the vaulted roof of a church

Five minutes after quitting Mdlle de Cardoville Mother Bunch having
left the garden without being perceived reascended to the first story
and knocked gently at the door of the pressroom A sister came to open
the door to her

Is not Mdlle Florine with whom I came still here sister asked the
needlewoman

She could not wait for you any longer No doubt you have come from our
mother the superior

Yes yes sister answered the sempstress casting down her eyes
would you have the goodness to show me the way out

Come with me

The sewinggirl followed the nun trembling at every step lest she
should meet the superior who would naturally have inquired the cause of
her long stay in the convent

At length the inner gate closed upon Mother Bunch Passing rapidly
across the vast courtyard and approaching the porters lodge to ask
him to let her out she heard these words pronounced in a gruff voice
It seems old Jerome that we are to be doubly on our guard tonight
Well I shall put two extra balls in my gun The superior says we are to
make two rounds instead of one

I want no gun Nicholas said the other voice I have my sharp
scythe a true gardeners weaponand none the worse for that

Feeling an involuntary uneasiness at these words which she had heard by
mere chance Mother Bunch approached the porters lodge and asked him
to open the outer gate

Where do you come from challenged the porter leaning half way out
of his lodge with a double barrelled gun which he was occupied in
loading in his hand and at the same time examining the sempstress with
a suspicious air

I come from speaking to the superior answered Mother Bunch timidly

Is that true said Nicholas roughly You look like a sanctified
scarecrow Never mind Make haste and cut

The gate opened and Mother Bunch went out Hardly had she gone a few
steps in the sweet when to her great surprise she saw the dog Spoil
sport run up to her and his master Dagobert a little way behind him
arriving also with precipitation She was hastening to meet the soldier
when a full sonorous voice exclaimed from a little distance Oh my
good sister which caused the girl to turn round From the opposite
side to that whence Dagobert was coming she saw Agricola hurrying
towards the spot




CHAPTER IX THE ENCOUNTERS

At the sight of Dagobert and Agricola Mother Bunch remained motionless
with surprise a few steps from the conventgate The soldier had not
yet perceived the sempstress He advanced rapidly following the dog
who though lean halfstarved roughcoated and dirty seemed to frisk
with pleasure as he turned his intelligent face towards his master to
whom he had gone back after caressing Mother Bunch

Yes yes I understand you old fellow said the soldier with
emotion You are more faithful than I was you did not leave the dear
children for a minute Yes you followed them and watched day and
night without food at the door of the house to which they were
takenand at length weary of waiting to see them come forth ran home
to fetch me Yes whilst I was giving way to despair like a furious
madman you were doing what I ought to have donediscovering their
retreat What does it all prove Why that beasts are better than
menwhich is well known Well at length I shall see them again When
I think that tomorrow is the 13th and that without you my did
Spoilsport all would be lostit makes me shudder But I say shall we
soon be there What a deserted quarter and night coming on

Dagobert had held this discourse to Spoilsport as he walked along
following the good dog who kept on at a rapid pace Suddenly seeing
the faithful animal start aside with a bound he raised his eyes and
perceived the dog frisking about the hunchback and Agricola who had
just met at a little distance from the conventgate

Mother Bunch exclaimed both father and son as they approached the
young workwoman and looked at her with extreme surprise

There is good hope M Dagobert said she with inexpressible joy
Rose and Blanche are found Then turning towards the smith she
added There is good hope Agricola Mdlle de Cardoville is not mad I
have just seen her

She is not mad what happiness exclaimed the smith

The children cried Dagobert trembling with emotion as he took the
workgirls hands in his own You have seen them

Yes just nowvery sadvery unhappybut I was not able to speak to
them

Oh said Dagobert stopping as if suffocated by the news and pressing
his hands on his bosom I never thought that my old heart could beat
soAnd yet thanks to my dog I almost expected what has taken place
Anyhow I am quite dizzy with joy

Well father its a good day said Agricola looking gratefully at
the girl

Kiss me my dear child added the soldier as he pressed Mother Bunch
affectionately in his arms then full of impatience he added Come
let us go and fetch the children

Ah my good sister said Agricola deeply moved you will restore
peace perhaps life to my fatherand Mdlle de Cardovillebut how do
you know

A mere chance And how did you come here

Spoilsport stops and barks cried Dagobert who had already made
several steps in advance

Indeed the dog who was as impatient as his master to see the orphans
and far better informed as to the place of their retreat had posted
himself at the convent gate and was beginning to bark to attract the
attention of Dagobert Understanding his dog the latter said to
the hunchback as he pointed in that direction with his finger The
children are there

Yes M Dagobert

I was sure of it Good dogOh yes beasts are better than
menexcept you my dear girl who are better than either man or beast
But my poor children I shall see them I shall have them once more

So saying Dagobert in spite of his age began to run very fast towards
Spoilsport Agricola cried Mother Bunch prevent thy father from
knocking at that door He would ruin all

In two strides the smith had reached his father just as the latter was
raising his hand to the knocker Stop father cried the smith as he
seized Dagobert by the arm

What the devil is it now

Mother Bunch says that to knock would ruin all

How so

She will explain it to you Although not so nimble as Agricola Mother
Bunch soon came up and said to the soldier M Dagobert do not let us
remain before this gate They might open it and see us and that would
excite suspicion Let us rather go away

Suspicion cried the veteran much surprised but without moving from
the gate what suspicion

I conjure you do not remain there said Mother Bunch with so much
earnestness that Agricola joined her and said to his father Since
sister rashes it father she has some reason for it The Boulevard de
lHopital is a few steps from here nobody passes that way we can talk
there without being interrupted

Devil take me if I understand a word of all this cried Dagobert
without moving from his post The children are here and I will fetch
them away with me It is an affair of ten minutes

Do not think that M Dagobert said Mother Bunch It is much more
difficult than you imagine But come comeI can hear them talk in the
courtyard

In fact the sound of voices was now distinctly audible Come father
said Agricola forcing away the soldier almost in spite of himself
Spoilsport who appeared much astonished at these hesitations barked
two or three times without quitting his post as if to protest against
this humiliating retreat but being called by Dagobert he hastened to
rejoin the main body

It was now about five oclock in the evening A high wind swept thick
masses of grayish rainy cloud rapidly across the sky The Boulevard de
lHopital which bordered on this portion of the conventgarden was
as we before said almost deserted Dagobert Agricola and the serving
girl could hold a private conference in this solitary place

The soldier did not disguise the extreme impatience that these delays
occasioned in him Hardly had they turned the corner of the street when
he said to Mother Bunch Come my child explain yourself I am upon
hot coals

The house in which the daughters of Marshal Simon are confined is a
convent M Dagobert

A convent cried the soldier I might have suspected it Then he
added Well what then I will fetch them from a convent as soon as
from any other place Once is not always

But M Dagobert they are confined against their will and against
yours They will not give them up

They will not give them up Zounds we will see about that And he
made a step towards the street

Father said Agricola holding him back one moments patience let
us hear all

I will hear nothing What the children are theretwo steps from meI
know itand I shall not have them either by fair means or foul Oh
that would indeed be curious Let me go

Listen to me I beseech you M Dagobert said Mother Bunch taking
his hand there is another way to deliver these poor children And that
without violencefor violence as Mdlle de Cardoville told me would
ruin all

If there is any other wayquicklet me know it

Here is a ring of Mdlle de Cardovilles

And who is this Mdlle de Cardoville

Father said Agricola it is the generous young lady who offered to
be my bail and to whom I have very important matters to communicate

Good good replied Dagobert we will talk of that presently Well
my dear girlthis ring

You must take it directly M Dagobert to the Count de Montbron
No 7 Place Vendome He appears to be a person of influence and is a
friend of Mdlle de Cardovilles This ring will prove that you come on
her behalf and you will tell him that she is confined as a lunatic in
the asylum next door to this convent in which the daughters of Marshal
Simon are detained against their will

Well wellwhat next

Then the Count de Montbron will take the proper steps with persons in
authority to restore both Mdlle de Cardoville and the daughters of
Marshal Simon to libertyand perhaps tomorrow or the day after

Tomorrow or the day after cried Dagobert perhapsIt is today
on the instant that I must have them The day after tomorrow would be
of much use Thanks my good girl but keep your ring I will manage my
own business Wait for me here my boy

What are you going to do father cried Agricola still holding back
the soldier It is a convent remember

You are only a raw recruit I have my theory of convents at my fingers
end In Spain I have put it in practice a hundred times Here is what
will happen I knock a portress opens the door to me she asks me what
I want but I make no answer she tries to stop me but I pass on once
in the convent I walk over it from top to bottom calling my children
with all my might

But M Dagobert the nuns said Mother Bunch still trying to detain
the soldier

The nuns run after me screaming like so many magpies I know them At
Seville I fetched out an Andalusian girl whom they were trying to keep
by force Well I walk about the convent calling for Rose and Blanche
They hear me and answer If they are shut in I take the first piece of
furniture that comes to hand and break open the door

But M Dagobertthe nunsthe nuns

The nuns with all their squalling will not prevent my breaking open
the door seizing my children in my arms and carrying them off Should
the outer door be shut there will be a second smashthats all So
added Dagobert disengaging himself from the grasp wait for me here
In ten minutes I shall be back again Go and get a hackneycoach ready
my boy

More calm than Dagobert and above all better informed as to the
provisions of the Penal Code Agricola was alarmed at the consequences
that might attend the veterans strange mode of proceeding So throwing
himself before him he exclaimed One word more I entreat you

Zounds make haste

If you attempt to enter the convent by force you will ruin all

How so

First of all M Dagobert said Mother Bunch there are men in the
convent As I came out just now I saw the porter loading his gun and
heard the gardener talking of his sharp scythe and the rounds he was to
make at night

Much I care for a porters gun and a gardeners scythe

Well father but listen to me a moment I conjure you Suppose you
knock and the door is openedthe porter will ask you what you want

I tell him that I wish to speak to the superior and so walk into the
convent

But M Dagobert said Mother Bunch when once you have crossed the
courtyard you reach a second door with a wicket A nun comes to it
to see who rings and does not open the door till she knows the object
of the visit

I will tell her that I wish to see the lady superior

Then father as you are not known in the convent they will go and
inform the superior

Well what then

She will come down

What next

She will ask you what you want M Dagobert

What I wantthe devil my children

One minutes patience father You cannot doubt from the precautions
they have taken that they wish to detain these young ladies against
their will and against yours

Doubt I am sure of it To come to that point they began by turning
the head of my poor wife

Then father the superior will reply to you that she does not know
what you mean and that the young ladies are not in the convent

And I will reply to her that they are in the convent witnessMother
Bunch and Spoilsport

The superior will answer that she does not know you that she has no
explanations to give you and will close the wicket

Then I break it opensince one must come to that in the endso leave
me alone I tell you sblood leave me alone

And on this noise and violence the porter will run and fetch the
guard and they will begin by arresting you

And what will become of your poor children then M Dagobert said
Mother Bunch

Agricolas father had too much good sense not to feel the truth of these
observations of the girl and his son but he knew also that cost
what it might the orphans must be delivered before the morrow The
alternative was terribleso terrible that pressing his two hands
to his burning forehead Dagobert sunk back upon a stone bench as if
struck down by the inexorable fatality of the dilemma

Agricola and the workwoman deeply moved by this mute despair exchanged
a sad look The smith seating himself beside the soldier said to him
Do not be downhearted father Remember whats been told you By going
with this ring of Mdlle de Cardovilles to the influential gentleman
she named the young ladies may be free by tomorrow or at worst by
the day after

Blood and thunder you want to drive me mad exclaimed Dagobert
starting up from the bench and looking at Mother Bunch and his son with
so savage an expression that Agricola and the sempstress drew back with
an air of surprise and uneasiness

Pardon me my children said Dagobert recovering himself after a long
silence I am wrong to get in a passion for we do not understand one
another What you say is true and yet I am right to speak as I do
Listen to me You are an honest man Agricola you an honest girl what
I tell you is meant for you alone I have brought these children from
the depths of Siberiado you know why That they may be tomorrow
morning in the Rue SaintFrancois If they are not there I have failed
to execute the last wish of their dying mother

No 3 Rue Saint Francois cried Agricola interrupting his father

Yes how do you know the number said Dagobert

Is not the date inscribed on a bronze medal

Yes replied Dagobert more end more surprised who told you

One instant father exclaimed Agricola let me reflect I think I
guess it Did you not tell me my good sister that Mdlle de Cardoville
was not mad

Not mad They detain her in this asylum to prevent her communicating
with any one She believes herself like the daughters of Marshal Simon
the victim of an odious machination

No doubt of it cried the smith I understand all now Mdlle de
Cardoville has the same interest as the orphans to appear tomorrow at
the Rue SaintFrancois But she does not perhaps know it

How so

One word more my good girl Did Mdlle de Cardoville tell you that she
had a powerful motive to obtain her freedom by tomorrow

No for when she gave me this ring for the Count de Montbron she said
to me By this means both I and Marshal Simons daughters will be at
liberty either tomorrow or the day after

But explain yourself then said Dagobert to his son with impatience

Just now replied the smith when you came to seek me in prison I
told you father that I had a sacred duty to perform and that I would
rejoin you at home

Yes and I went on my side to take some measures of which I will
speak to you presently

I ran instantly to the house in the Rue de Babylone not knowing that
Mdlle de Cardoville was mad or passed for mad A servant who opened
the door to me informed me that the young lady had been seized with a
sudden attack of madness You may conceive father what a blow that was
to me I asked where she was they answered that they did not know
I asked if I could speak to any of the family as my jacket did not
inspire any great confidence they replied that none of her family were
at present there I was in despair but an idea occurred to me I said
to myself If she is mad her family physician must know where they
have taken her if she is in a state to hear me he will take me to
her if not I will speak to her doctor as I would to her relations
A doctor is often a friend I asked the servant therefore to give me
the doctors address I obtained it without difficultyDr Baleinier
No 12 Rue Taranne I ran thither but he had gone out they told me
that I should find him about five oclock at his asylum which is next
door to the convent That is how we have met

But the medalthe medal said Dagobert impatiently where did you
see it

It is with regard to this and other things that I wished to make
important communications to Mdlle de Cardoville

And what are these communications

The fact is father I had gone to her the day of your departure to
beg her to get me bail I was followed and when she learned this from
her waitingwoman she concealed me in a hidingplace It was a sort of
little vaulted room in which no light was admitted except through a
tunnel made like a chimney yet in a few minutes I could see pretty
clearly Having nothing better to do I looked all about me and saw that
the walls were covered with wainscoting The entrance to this room
was composed of a sliding panel moving by means of weights and wheels
admirably contrived As these concern my trade I was interested in
them so I examined the springs spite of my emotion with curiosity
and understood the nature of their play but there was one brass knob
of which I could not discover the use It was in vain to pull and move
it from right to left none of the springs were touched I said
to myself This knob no doubt belongs to another piece of
mechanismand the idea occurred to me instead of drawing it towards
me to push it with force Directly after I heard a grating sound
and perceived just above the entrance to the hidingplace one of the
panels about two feet square fly open like the door of a secretary As
I had no doubt pushed the spring rather too hard a bronze medal and
chain fell out with a shock

And you saw the addressRue SaintFrancois cried Dagobert

Yes father and with this medal a sealed letter fell to the ground
On picking it up I saw that it was addressed in large letters For
Mdlle de Cardoville To be opened by her the moment it is delivered
Under these words I saw the initials R and C accompanied by a
flourish and this date Paris November the 13th 1830 On the other
side of the envelope I perceived two seals with the letters R and
C surmounted by a coronet

And the seals were unbroken asked Mother Bunch

Perfectly whole

No doubt then Mdlle de Cardoville was ignorant of the existence of
these papers said the sempstress

That was my first idea since she was recommended to open the letter
immediately and notwithstanding this recommendation which bore date
two years back the seals remained untouched

It is evident said Dagobert What did you do

I replaced the whole where it was before promising myself to inform
Mdlle de Cardoville of it But a few minutes after they entered my
hidingplace which had been discovered and I did not see her again I
was only able to whisper a few words of doubtful meaning to one of her
waitingwomen on the subject of what I had found hoping thereby to
arouse the attention of her mistress and as soon as I was able to
write to you my good sister I begged you to go and call upon Mdlle de
Cardoville

But this medal said Dagobert is exactly like that possessed by the
daughter of Marshal Simon How can you account for that

Nothing so plain father Mdlle de Cardoville is their relation I
remember now that she told me so

A relation of Rose and Blanche

Yes added Mother Bunch she told that also to me just now

Well then resumed Dagobert looking anxiously at his son do you
now understand why I must have my children this very day Do you now
understand as their poor mother told me on her deathbed that one
days delay might ruin all Do you now see that I cannot be satisfied
with a perhaps tomorrow when I have come all the way from Siberia
only that those children might be tomorrow in the Rue SaintFrancois
Do you at last perceive that I must have them this night even if I have
to set fire to the convent

But father if you employ violence

Zounds do you know what the commissary of police answered me this
morning when I went to renew my charge against your mothers confessor
He said to me that there was no proof and that they could do nothing

But now there is proof father for at least we know where the young
girls are With that certainty we shall be strong The law is more
powerful than all the superiors of convents in the world

And the Count de Montbron to whom Mdlle de Cardoville begs you to
apply said Mother Bunch is a man of influence Tell him the reasons
that make it so important for these young ladies as well as Mdlle de
Cardoville to be at liberty this evening and he will certainly hasten
the course of justice and tonight your children will be restored to
you

Sister is in the right father Go to the Count Meanwhile I will run
to the commissary and tell him that we now know where the young girls
are confined Do you go home and wait for us my good girl We will
meet at our own house

Dagobert had remained plunged in thought suddenly he said to Agricola
Be it so I will follow your counsel But suppose the commissary says
to you We cannot act before tomorrowsuppose the Count de Montbron
says to me the same thingdo not think I shall stand with my arms
folded until the morning

But father

It is enough resumed the soldier in an abrupt voice I have made
up my mind Run to the commissary my boy wait for us at home my good
girl I will go to the Count Give me the ring Now for the address

The Count de Montbron No 7 Place Vendome said she you come on
behalf of Mdlle de Cardoville

I have a good memory answered the soldier We will meet as soon as
possible in the Rue BriseMiche

Yes father have good courage You will see that the law protects and
defends honest people

So much the better said the soldier because otherwise honest
people would be obliged to protect and defend themselves Farewell my
children we will meet soon in the Rue BriseMiche

When Dagobert Agricola and Mother Bunch separated it was already dark
night




CHAPTER X THE MEETING

It is eight oclock in the evening the rain dashes against the windows
of Frances Baudoins apartment in the Rue BriseMiche while violent
squalls of wind shake the badly dosed doors and casements The disorder
and confusion of this humble abode usually kept with so much care and
neatness bore testimony to the serious nature of the sad events which
had thus disturbed existences hitherto peaceful in their obscurity

The paved floor was soiled with mud and a thick layer of dust covered
the furniture once so bright and clean Since Frances was taken away by
the commissary the bed had not been made at night Dagobert had thrown
himself upon it for a few hours in his clothes when worn out with
fatigue and crushed by despair he had returned from new and vain
attempts to discover Rose and Blanches prisonhouse Upon the drawers
stood a bottle a glass and some fragments of dry bread proving the
frugality of the soldier whose means of subsistence were reduced to the
money lent by the pawnbroker upon the things pledged by Mother Bunch
after the arrest of Frances

By the faint glimmer of a candle placed upon the little stove now cold
as marble for the stock of wood had long been exhausted one might have
seen the hunchback sleeping upon a chair her head resting on her bosom
her hands concealed beneath her cotton apron and her feet resting on
the lowest rung of the chair from time to time she shivered in her
damp chill garments

After that long day of fatigue and diverse emotions the poor creature
had eaten nothing Had she even thought of it she would have been at a
loss for bread Waiting for the return of Dagobert and Agricola she
had sunk into an agitated sleepvery different alas from calm
and refreshing slumber From time to time she half opened her eyes
uneasily and looked around her Then again overcome by irresistible
heaviness her head fell upon her bosom

After some minutes of silence only interrupted by the noise of the
wind a slow and heavy step was heard on the landingplace The door
opened and Dagobert entered followed by Spoilsport

Waking with a start Mother Bunch raised her head hastily sprang from
her chair and advancing rapidly to meet Agricolas father said to
him Well M Dagobert have you good news Have you

She could not continue she was so struck with the gloomy expression of
the soldiers features Absorbed in his reflections he did not at first
appear to perceive the speaker but threw himself despondingly on a
chair rested his elbows upon the table and hid his face in his
hands After a long meditation he rose and said in a low voice It
mustyes it must be done

Taking a few steps up and down the room Dagobert looked around him
as if in search of something At length after about a minutes
examination he perceived near the stove a bar of iron perhaps two
feet long serving to lift the covers when too hot for the fingers
Taking this in his hand he looked at it closely poised it to judge
of its weight and then laid it down upon the drawers with an air of
satisfaction Surprised at the long silence of Dagobert the needlewoman
followed his movements with timid and uneasy curiosity But soon her
surprise gave way to fright when she saw the soldier take down his
knapsack place it upon a chair open it and draw from it a pair of
pocketpistols the locks of which he tried with the utmost caution

Seized with terror the sempstress could not forbear exclaiming Good
gracious M Dagobert what are you going to do

The soldier looked at her as if he only now perceived her for the first
time and said to her in a cordial but abrupt voice Goodevening my
good girl What is the time

Eight oclock has just struck at SaintMerys M Dagobert

Eight oclock said the soldier speaking to himself only eight

Placing the pistols by the side of the iron bar he appeared again to
reflect while he cast his eyes around him

M Dagobert ventured the girl you have not then good news

No

That single word was uttered by the soldier in so sharp a tone that
not daring to question him further Mother Bunch sat down in silence
Spoil sport came to lean his head on the knees of the girl and followed
the movements of Dagobert with as much curiosity as herself

After remaining for some moments pensive and silent the soldier
approached the bed took a sheet from it appeared to measure its
length and then said turning towards Mother Bunch The scissors

But M Dagobert

Come my good girl the scissors replied Dagobert in a kind tone
but one that commanded obedience The sempstress took the scissors from
Frances workbasket and presented them to the soldier

Now hold the other end of the sheet my girl and draw it out tight

In a few minutes Dagobert had cut the sheet into four strips which he
twisted in the fashion of cords fastening them here and there with bits
of tape so as to preserve the twist and tying them strongly together
so as to make a rope of about twenty feet long This however did not
suffice him for he said to himself Now I must have a hook

Again he looked around him and Mother Bunch more and more frightened
for she now no longer doubted Dagoberts designs said to him timidly
M Dagobert Agricola has not yet come in It may be some good news
that makes him so late

Yes said the soldier bitterly as he continued to cast round his
eyes in search of something he wanted good news like mine But I must
have a strong iron hook

Still looking about he found one of the coarse gray sacks that
Frances was accustomed to make He took it opened it and said to the
work girl Put me the iron bar and the cord into this bag my girl It
will be easier to carry

Heavens cried she obeying his directions you will not go without
seeing Agricola M Dagobert He may perhaps have some good news to tell
you

Be satisfied I shall wait for my boy I need not start before ten
oclockso I have time

Alas M Dagobert have you last all hope

On the contrary I have good hopebut in myself

So saying Dagobert twisted the upper end of the sack for the purpose
of closing it and placed it on the drawers by the side of his pistols

At all events you will wait for Agricola M Dagobert

Yes if he arrives before ten oclock

Alas you have then quite made up your mind

Quite And yet if I were weak enough to believe in bad omens

Sometimes M Dagobert omens do not deceive one said the girl
hoping to induce the soldier to abandon his dangerous resolution

Yes resumed Dagobert old women say soand although I am not an
old woman what I saw just now weighed heavily on my heart After all I
may have taken a feeling of anger for a presentiment

What have you seen

I will tell it you my good girl it may help to pass the time which
appears long enough Then interrupting himself he exclaimed Was it
the half hour that just struck

Yes M Dagobert it is halfpast eight

Still an hour and a half said Dagobert in a hollow voice This
he added is what I saw As I came along the street my notice was
attracted by a large red placard at the head of which was a black
panther devouring a white horse That sight gave me a turn for you
must know my good girl that a black panther destroyed a poor old white
horse that I had Spoilsports companion whose name was Jovial

At the sound of this name once so familiar Spoilsport who was
crouching at the workwomans feet raised his head hastily and looked
at Dagobert

You see that beasts have memoryhe recollects said the soldier
sighing himself at the remembrance Then addressing his dog he added
Dost remember Jovial

On hearing this name a second time pronounced by his master in a voice
of emotion Spoilsport gave a low whine as if to indicate that he had
not forgotten his old travelling companion

It was indeed a melancholy incident M Dagobert said Mother Bunch
to find upon this placard a panther devouring a horse

That is nothing to whats to come you shall hear the rest I drew near
the bill and read in it that one Morok just arrived from Germany is
about to exhibit in a theatre different wild beasts that he tamed among
others a splendid lion a tiger and a black Java panther named Death

What an awful name said the hearer

You will think it more awful my child when I tell you that this is
the very panther which strangled my horse at Leipsic four months ago

Good Heaven you are right M Dagobert said the girl it is awful

Wait a little said Dagobert whose countenance was growing more and
more gloomy that is not all It was by means of this very Morok the
owner of the panther that I and my poor children were imprisoned in
Leipsic

And this wicked man is in Paris and wishes you evil said Mother
Bunch Oh you are right M Dagobert you must take care of yourself
it is a bad omen

For him if I catch him said Dagobert in a hollow tone We have old
accounts to settle

M Dagobert cried Mother Bunch listening some one is running up
the stairs It is Agricolas footsteps I am sure he has good news

That will just do said the soldier hastily without answering
Agricola is a smith He will be able to find me the iron hook

A few moments after Agricola entered the room but alas the
sempstress perceived at the first glance in the dejected countenance of
the workman the ruin of her cherished hopes

Well said Dagobert to his son in a tone which clearly announced the
little faith he attached to the steps taken by Agricola well what
news

Father it is enough to drive one madto make one dash ones brains
out against the wall cried the smith in a rage

Dagobert turned towards Mother Bunch and said You see my poor
childI was sure of it

Well father cried Agricola have you seen the Court de Montbron

The Count de Montbron set out for Lorraine three days ago That is
my good news continued the soldier with bitter irony let us have
yoursI long to know all I need to know if on appealing to the laws
which as you told me protect and defend honest people it ever happens
that the rogues get the best of it I want to know this and then I want
an iron hookso I count upon you for both

What do you mean father

First tell me what you have done We have time It is not much more
than halfpast eight On leaving me where did you go first

To the commissary who had already received your depositions

What did he say to you

After having very kindly listened to all I had to state he answered
that these young girls were placed in a respectable house a conventso
that there did not appear any urgent necessity for their immediate
removaland besides he could not take upon himself to violate the
sanctity of a religious dwelling upon your simple testimony tomorrow
he will make his report to the proper authorities and steps will be
taken accordingly

Yes yesplenty of put offs said the soldier

But sir answered I to him resumed Agricola it is now this
very night that you ought to act for if these young girls should not
be present tomorrow morning in the Rue Saint Francois their interests
may suffer incalculable damage I am very sorry for it replied he
but I cannot upon your simple declaration or that of your father
wholike yourselfis no relation or connection of these young persons
act in direct opposition to forms which could not be set aside even on
the demand of a family The law has its delays and its formalities to
which we are obliged to submit

Certainly said Dagobert We must submit to them at the risk of
becoming cowardly ungrateful traitors

Didst speak also of Mdlle de Cardoville to him asked the workgirl

Yesbut he answered me on this subject in much the same manner It
was very serious there was no proof in support of my deposition A
third party had told me that Mdlle de Cardoville affirms she was not
mad but all mad people pretend to be sane He could not therefore
upon my sole testimony take upon himself to enter the house of a
respectable physician But he would report upon it and the law would
have its course

When I wished to act just now for myself said Dagobert did I not
forsee all this And yet I was weak enough to listen to you

But father what you wished to attempt was impossible and you agreed
that it would expose you to far too dangerous consequences

So resumed the soldier without answering his son they told you in
plain terms that we must not think of obtaining legally the release of
Rose and Blanche this evening or even tomorrow morning

Yes father In the eyes of the law there is no special urgency The
question may not be decided for two or three days

That is all I wished to know said Dagobert rising and walking up and
down the room

And yet resumed his son I did not consider myself beaten In
despair but believing that justice could not remain deaf to such
equitable claims I ran to the Palais de Justice hoping to find there a
judge a magistrate who would receive my complaint and act upon it

Well said the soldier stopping him

I was told that the courts shut every day at five oclock and do not
open again til ten in the morning Thinking of your despair and of the
position of poor Mdlle de Cardoville I determined to make one more
attempt I entered a guardhouse of troops of the line commanded by a
lieutenant I told him all He saw that I was so much moved
and I spoke with such warmth and conviction that he became
interestedLieutenant said I to him grant me one favor let
a petty officer and two soldiers go to the convent to obtain a legal
entrance Let them ask to see the daughters of Marshal Simon and
learn whether it is their choice to remain or return to my father who
brought them from Russia You will then see if they are not detained
against their will

And what answer did he give you Agricola asked Mother Bunch while
Dagobert shrugged his shoulders and continued to walk up and down

My good fellow said he what you ask me is impossible I understand
your motives but I cannot take upon myself so serious a measure I
should be broke were I to enter a convent by forceThen sir what am
I to do It is enough to turn ones headFaith I dont know said
the lieutenant it will be safest I think to waitThen believing
I had done all that was possible father I resolved to come back in
the hope that you might have been more fortunate than Ibut alas I
was deceived

So saying the smith sank upon a chair for he was worn out with anxiety
and fatigue There was a moment of profound silence after these words of
Agricola which destroyed the last hopes of the three mute and crushed
beneath the strokes of inexorable fatality

A new incident came to deepen the sad and painful character of this
scene




CHAPTER XI DISCOVERIES

The door which Agricola had not thought of fastening opened as it were
timidly and Frances Baudoin Dagoberts wife pale sinking hardly
able to support herself appeared on the threshold

The soldier Agricola and Mother Bunch were plunged in such deep
dejection that neither of them at first perceived the entrance Frances
advanced two steps into the room fell upon her knees clasped her
hands together and said in a weak and humble voice My poor
husbandpardon

At these words Agricola and the workgirlwhose backs were towards the
doorturned round suddenly and Dagobert hastily raised his head

My mother cried Agricola running to Frances

My wife cried Dagobert as he also rose and advanced to meet the
unfortunate woman

On your knees dear mother said Agricola stooping down to embrace
her affectionately Get up I entreat you

No my child said Frances in her mild firm accents I will not
rise till your father has forgiven me I have wronged him muchnow I
know it

Forgive you my poor wife said the soldier as he drew near with
emotion Have I ever accused you except in my first transport of
despair No no it was the bad priests that I accused and there I was
right Well I have you again added he assisting his son to raise
Frances one grief the less They have then restored you to liberty
Yesterday I could not even learn in what prison they had put you I
have so many cares that I could not think of you only But come dear
wife sit down

How feeble you are dear motherhow coldhow pale said Agricola
with anguish his eyes filling with tears

Why did you not let us know added he We would have gone to fetch
you But how you tremble Your hands are frozen continued the smith
as he knelt down before Frances Then turning towards Mother Bunch
Pray make a little fire directly

I thought of it as soon as your father came in Agricola but there is
no wood nor charcoal left

Then pray borrow some of Father Loriot my dear sister He is too good
a fellow to refuse My poor mother trembles soshe might fall ill

Hardly had he said the words than Mother Bunch went out The smith rose
from the ground took the blanket from the bed and carefully wrapped
it about the knees and feet of his mother Then again kneeling down he
said to her Your hands dear mother and taking those feeble palms
in his own he tried to warm them with his breath

Nothing could be more touching than this picture the robust young man
with his energetic and resolute countenance expressing by his looks
the greatest tenderness and paying the most delicate attentions to his
poor pale trembling old mother

Dagobert kindhearted as his son went to fetch a pillow and brought
it to his wife saying Lean forward a little and I will put this
pillow behind you you will be more comfortable and warmer

How you both spoil me said Frances trying to smile And you to
be so kind after all the ill I have done added she to Dagobert
as disengaging one of her hands from those of her son she took the
soldiers hand and pressed it to her tearful eyes In prison said she
in a low voice I had time to repent

Agricolas heart was near breaking at the thought that his pious and
good mother with her angelic purity should for a moment have been
confined in prison with so many miserable creatures He would have made
some attempt to console her on the subject of the painful past but he
feared to give a new shock to Dagobert and was silent

Where is Gabriel dear mother inquired he How is he As you have
seen him tell us all about him

I have seen Gabriel said Frances drying her tears he is confined
at home His superiors have rigorously forbidden his going out Luckily
they did not prevent his receiving me for his words and counsels have
opened my eyes to many things It is from him that I learned how guilty
I had been to you my poor husband

How so asked Dagobert

Why you know that if I caused you so much grief it was not from
wickedness When I saw you in such despair I suffered almost as much
myself but I durst not tell you so for fear of breaking my oath I had
resolved to keep it believing that I did well believing that it was
my duty And yet something told me that it could not be my duty to
cause you so much pain Alas my God enlighten me I exclaimed in
my prison as I knelt down and prayed in spite of the mockeries of
the other women Why should a just and pious work commanded by my
confessor the most respectable of men overwhelm me and mine with so
much misery Have mercy on me my God and teach me if I have done
wrong without knowing it As I prayed with fervor God heard me and
inspired me with the idea of applying to Gabriel I thank Thee Father
I will obey said I within myself Gabriel is like my own child but
he is also a priest a martyralmost a saint If any one in the world
imitates the charity of our blessed Saviour it is surely he When I
leave this prison I will go and consult him and he will clear up my
doubts

You are right dear mother cried Agricola it was a thought from
heaven Gabriel is an angel of purity courage noblenessthe type of
the true and good priest

Ah poor wife said Dagobert with bitterness if you had never had
any confessor but Gabriel

I thought of it before he went on his journey said Frances with
simplicity I should have liked to confess to the dear boybut I
fancied Abbe Dubois would be offended and that Gabriel would be too
indulgent with regard to my sins

Your sins poor dear mother said Agricola As if you ever committed
any

And what did Gabriel tell you asked the soldier

Alas my dear had I but had such an interview with him sooner What
I told him of Abbe Dubois roused his suspicions and he questioned me
dear child as to many things of which he had never spoken to me before
Then I opened to him my whole heart and he did the same to me and
we both made sad discoveries with regard to persons whom we had always
thought very respectable and who yet had deceived each of us unknown
to the other

How so

Why they used to tell him under the seal of secrecy things that were
supposed to come from me and they used to tell me under the same
seal of secrecy things that were supposed to come from him Thus he
confessed to me that he did not feel at first any vocation for the
priesthood but they told him that I should not believe myself safe in
this world or in the next if he did not take orders because I felt
persuaded that I could best serve the Lord by giving Him so good a
servant and that yet I had never dared to ask Gabriel himself to give
me this proof of his attachment though I had taken him from the street
a deserted orphan and brought him up as my own son at the cost of
labor and privations Then how could it be otherwise The poor dear
child thinking he could please me sacrificed himself He entered the
seminary

Horrible said Agricola tis an infamous snare and for the priests
who were guilty of it a sacrilegious lie

During all that time resumed Frances they were holding very
different language to me I was told that Gabriel felt his vocation but
that he durst not avow it to me for fear of my being jealous on account
of Agricola who being brought up as a workman would not enjoy the
same advantages as those which the priesthood would secure to Gabriel
So when he asked my permission to enter the seminary dear child
he entered it with regret but he thought he was making me so
happyinstead of discouraging this idea I did all in my power to
persuade him to follow it assuring him that he could not do better and
that it would occasion me great joy You understand I exaggerated for
fear he should think me jealous on account of Agricola

What an odious machination said Agricola in amazement They were
speculating in this unworthy manner upon your mutual devotion Thus
Gabriel saw the expression of your dearest wish in the almost forced
encouragement given to his resolution

Little by little however as Gabriel has the best heart in the world
the vocation really came to him That was natural enoughhe was born
to console those who suffer and devote himself for the unfortunate
He would never have spoken to me of the past had it not been for this
mornings interview But then I beheld him who is usually so mild and
gentle become indignant exasperated against M Rodin and another
person whom he accuses He had serious complaints against them already
but these discoveries he says will make up the measure

At these words of Frances Dagobert pressed his hand to his forehead as
if to recall something to his memory For some minutes he had listened
with surprise and almost terror to the account of these secret plots
conducted with such deep and crafty dissimulation

Frances continued When at last I acknowledged to Gabriel that by the
advice of Abbe Dubois my confessor I had delivered to a stranger the
children confined to my husbandGeneral Simons daughtersthe dear boy
blamed me though with great regret not for having wished to instruct
the poor orphans in the truths of our holy religion but for having
acted without the consent of my husband who alone was answerable before
God and man for the charge entrusted to him Gabriel severely censured
Abbe Dubois conduct who had given me he said bad and perfidious
counsels and then with the sweetness of an angel the dear boy
consoled me and exhorted me to come and tell you all My poor husband
he would fain have accompanied me for I had scarcely courage to
come hither so strongly did I feel the wrong I had done you but
unfortunately Gabriel is confined at the seminary by the strict order
of his superiors he could not come with me and

Here Dagobert who seemed much agitated abruptly interrupted his wife
One word Frances said he for in truth in the midst of so many
cares and black diabolical plots one loses ones memory and the head
begins to wander Didst not tell me the day the children disappeared
that Gabriel when taken in by you had round his neck a bronze medal
and in his pocket a book filled with papers in a foreign language

Yes my dear

And this medal and these papers were afterwards delivered to your
confessor

Yes my dear

And Gabriel never spoke of them since

Never

Agricola hearing this from his mother looked at her with surprise
and exclaimed Then Gabriel has the same interest as the daughters of
General Simon or Mdlle de Cardoville to be in the Rue SaintFrancois
tomorrow

Certainly said Dagobert And now do you remember what he said to us
just after my arrivalthat in a few days he would need our support in
a serious matter

Yes father

And he is kept a prisoner at his seminary And he tells your mother
that he has to complain of his superiors and he asked us for our
support with so sad and grave an air that I said to him

He would speak so if about to engage in a deadly duel interrupted
Agricola True father and yet you who are a good judge of valor
acknowledged that Gabriels courage was equal to yours For him so to
fear his superiors the danger must be great indeed

Now that I have heard your mother I understand it all said Dagobert
Gabriel is like Rose and Blanche like Mdlle de Cardoville like your
mother like all of us perhapsthe victim of a secret conspiracy of
wicked priests Now that I know their dark machinations their infernal
perseverance I see added the soldier in a whisper that it requires
strength to struggle against them I had not the least idea of their
power

You are right father for those who are hypocritical and wicked do as
much harm as those who are good and charitable like Gabriel do good
There is no more implacable enemy than a bad priest

I know it and thats what frightens me for my poor children are
in their hands But is all lost Shall I bring myself to give them up
without an effort Oh no no I will not show any weaknessand yet
since your mother told us of these diabolical plots I do not know how
it is but I seem less strong less resolute What is passing around me
appears so terrible The spiriting away of these children is no longer
an isolated factit is one of the ramifications of a vast conspiracy
which surrounds and threatens us all It seems to me as if I and those I
love walked together in darkness in the midst of serpents in the midst
of snares that we can neither see nor struggle against Well Ill
speak out I have never feared deathI am not a coward and yet I
confessyes I confess itthese black robes frighten me

Dagobert pronounced these words in so sincere a tone that his son
started for he shared the same impression And it was quite natural
Frank energetic resolute characters accustomed to act and fight in
the light of day never feel but one fearand that is to be ensnared
and struck in the dark by enemies that escape their grasp Thus
Dagobert had encountered death twenty times and yet on hearing his
wifes simple revelation of this dark tissue of lies and treachery and
crime the soldier felt a vague sense of fear and though nothing
was changed in the conditions of his nocturnal enterprise against the
convent it now appeared to him in a darker and more dangerous light

The silence which had reigned for some moments was interrupted by
Mother Bunchs return The latter knowing that the interview between
Dagobert his wife and Agricola ought not have any importunate
witness knocked lightly at the door and remained in the passage with
Father Loriot

Can we come in Mme Frances asked the sempstress Here is Father
Loriot bringing some wood

Yes yes come in my good girl said Agricola whilst his father
wiped the cold sweat from his forehead

The door opened and the worthy dyer appeared with his hands and arms
of an amaranthine color on one side he carried a basket of wood and
on the other some live coal in a shovel

Goodevening to the company said Daddy Loriot Thank you for having
thought of me Mme Frances You know that my shop and everything in it
are at your service Neighbors should help one another thats my motto
You were kind enough I should think to my late wife

Then placing the wood in a corner and giving the shovel to Agricola
the worthy dyer guessing from the sorrowful appearance of the different
actors in this scene that it would be impolite to prolong his visit
added You dont want anything else Mme Frances

No thank you Father Loriot

Then goodevening to the company said the dyer and addressing
Mother Bunch he added Dont forget the letter for M Dagobert I
durstnt touch it for fear of leaving the marks of my four fingers and
thumb in amaranthine But good evening to the company and Father
Loriot went out

M Dagobert here is a letter said Mother Bunch She set herself to
light the fire in the stove while Agricola drew his mothers armchair
to the hearth

See what it is my boy said Dagobert to his son my head is so heavy
that I cannot see clear Agricola took the letter which contained only
a few lines and read it before he looked at the signature

 At Sea December 25th 1831

 I avail myself of a few minutes communication with a ship bound
 direct for Europe to write to you my old comrade a few hasty
 lines which will reach you probably by way of Havre before the
 arrival of my last letters from India You must by this time be at
 Paris with my wife and childtell themI am unable to say more
 the boat is departing Only one word I shall soon be in France
 Do not forget the 13th February the future of my wife and child
 depends upon it

 Adieu my friend Believe in my eternal gratitude

 SIMON

Agricolaquick look to your father cried the hunchback

From the first words of this letter which present circumstances made so
cruelly applicable Dagobert had become deadly pale Emotion fatigue
exhaustion joined to this last blow made him stagger

His son hastened to him and supported him in his arms But soon the
momentary weakness passed away and Dagobert drawing his hand across
his brow raised his tall figure to its full height Then whilst his
eye sparkled his rough countenance took an expression of determined
resolution and he exclaimed in wild excitement No no I will not
be a traitor I will not be a coward The black robes shall not frighten
me and this night Rose and Blanche Simon shall be free




CHAPTER XII THE PENAL CODE

Startled for a moment by the dark and secret machinations of the black
robes as he called them against the persons he most loved Dagobert
might have hesitated an instant to attempt the deliverance of Rose and
Blanche but his indecision ceased directly on the reading of Marshal
Simons letter which came so timely to remind him of his sacred duties

To the soldiers passing dejection had succeeded a resolution full of
calm and collected energy

Agricola what oclock is it asked he of his son

Just struck nine father

You must make me directly an iron hookstrong enough to support my
weight and wide enough to hold on the coping of a wall This stove will
be forge and anvil you will find a hammer in the house and for iron
said the soldier hesitating and looking around him as for ironhere
is some

So saying the soldier took from the hearth a strong pair of tongs and
presented them to his son adding Come my boy blow up the fire blow
it to a white heat and forge me this iron

On these words Frances and Agricola looked at each other with surprise
the smith remained mute and confounded not knowing the resolution
of his father and the preparations he had already commenced with the
needlewomans aid

Dont you hear me Agricola repeated Dagobert still holding the pair
of tongs in his hand you must make me a hook directly

A hook fatherfor what purpose

To tie to the end of a cord that I have here There must be a loop at
one end large enough to fix it securely

But this cordthis hookfor what purpose are they

To scale the walls of the convent if I cannot get in by the door

What convent asked Frances of her son

How father cried the latter rising abruptly You still think of
that

Why what else should I think of

But father it is impossible you will never attempt such an
enterprise

What is it my child asked Frances with anxiety Where is father
going

He is going to break into the convent where Marshal Simons daughters
are confined and carry them off

Great God my poor husbanda sacrilege cried Frances faithful to
her pious traditions and clasping her hands together she endeavored
to rise and approach Dagobert

The soldier forseeing that he would have to contend with observations
and prayers of all sorts and resolved not to yield determined to cut
short all useless supplications which would only make him lose precious
time He said therefore with a grave severe and almost solemn air
which showed the inflexibility of his determination Listen to me
wifeand you also my sonwhen at my age a man makes up his mind to
do anything he knows the reason why And when a man has once made up
his mind neither wife nor child can alter it I have resolved to do my
duty so spare yourselves useless words It may be your duty to talk to
me as you have done but it is over now and we will say no more about
it This evening I must be master in my own house

Timid and alarmed Frances did not dare to utter a word but she turned
a supplicating glance towards her son

Father said the latter one word moreonly one

Let us hear replied Dagobert impatiently

I will not combat your resolution but I will prove to you that you do
not know to what you expose yourself

I know it all replied the soldier in an abrupt tone The
undertaking is a serious one but it shall not be said that I neglected
any means to accomplish what I promised to do

But father you do not know to what danger you expose yourself said
the smith much alarmed

Talk of danger talk of the porters gun and the gardeners scythe
said Dagobert shrugging his shoulders contemptuously Talk of them
and have done with it for after all suppose I were to leave my carcass
in the convent would not you remain to your mother For twenty years
you were accustomed to do without me It will be all the less trying to
you

And I alas am the cause of these misfortunes cried the poor mother
Ah Gabriel had good reason to blame me

Mme Frances be comforted whispered the sempstress who had drawn
near to Dagoberts wife Agricola will not suffer his father to expose
himself thus

After a moments hesitation the smith resumed in an agitated voice
I know you too well father to think of stopping you by the fear of
death

Of what danger then do you speak

Of a danger from which even you will shrink brave as you are said
the young man in a voice of emotion that forcibly struck his father

Agricola said the soldier roughly and severely that remark is
cowardly you are insulting

Father

Cowardly resumed the soldier angrily because it is cowardice to
wish to frighten a man from his dutyinsulting because you think me
capable of being so frightened

Oh M Dagobert exclaimed the sewinggirl you do not understand
Agricola

I understand him too well answered the soldier harshly

Painfully affected by the severity of his father but firm in his
resolution which sprang from love and respect Agricola resumed whilst
his heart beat violently Forgive me if I disobey you father but
were you to hate me for it I must tell you to what you expose yourself
by scaling at night the walls of a convent

My son do you dare cried Dagobert his countenance inflamed with
rageAgricola exclaimed Frances in tears My husband

M Dagobert listen to Agricola exclaimed Mother Bunch It is only
in your interest that he speaks

Not one word more replied the soldier stamping his foot with anger

I tell you father exclaimed the smith growing fearfully pale as he
spoke that you risk being sent to the galleys

Unhappy boy cried Dagobert seizing his son by the arm could you
not keep that from merather than expose me to become a traitor and a
coward And the soldier shuddered as he repeated The galleysand
bending down his head remained mute pensive withered as it were by
those blasting words

Yes to enter an inhabited place by night in such a manner is what
the law calls burglary and punishes with the galleys cried Agricola
at once grieved and rejoicing at his fathers depression of mindyes
father the galleys if you are taken in the act and there are ten
chances to one that you would be so Mother Bunch has told you the
convent is guarded This morning had you attempted to carry off the two
young ladies in broad daylight you would have been arrested but at
least the attempt would have been an open one with a character of
honest audacity about it that hereafter might have procured your
acquittal But to enter by night and by scaling the wallsI tell you
the galleys would be the consequence Now father decide Whatever you
do I will do alsofor you shall not go alone Say but the word and I
will forge the hook for youI have here hammer and pincersand in an
hour we will set out

A profound silence followed these wordsa silence that was only
interrupted by the stifled sobs of Frances who muttered to herself in
despair Alas this is the consequence of listening to Abbe Dubois

It was in vain that Mother Bunch tried to console Frances She was
herself alarmed for the soldier was capable of braving even infamy and
Agricola had determined to share the perils of his father

In spite of his energetic and resolute character Dagobert remained for
some time in a kind of stupor According to his military habits he had
looked at this nocturnal enterprise only as a ruse de guerre authorized
by his good cause and by the inexorable fatality of his position but
the words of his son brought him back to the fearful reality and
left him the choice of a terrible alternativeeither to betray the
confidence of Marshal Simon and set at naught the last wishes of the
mother of the orphanor else to expose himself and above all his
son to lasting disgracewithout even the certainty of delivering the
orphans after all

Drying her eyes bathed in tears Frances exclaimed as if by a sudden
inspiration Dear me I have just thought of it There is perhaps a way
of getting these dear children from the convent without violence

How so mother said Agricola hastily

It is Abbe Dubois who had them conveyed thither but Gabriel supposes
that he probably acted by the advice of M Rodin

And if that were so mother it would be in vain to apply to M Rodin
We should get nothing from him

Not from himbut perhaps from that powerful abbe who is Gabriels
superior and has always patronized him since his first entrance at the
seminary

What abbe mother

Abbe dAigrigny

True mother before being a priest he was a soldier he may be more
accessible than othersand yet

DAigrigny cried Dagobert with an expression of hate and horror
There is then mixed up with these treasons a man who was a soldier
before being a priest and whose name is DAigrigny

Yes father the Marquis dAigrignybefore the Restoration in the
service of Russiabut in 1815 the Bourbons gave him a regiment

It is he said Dagobert in a hollow voice Always the same like an
evil spiritto the mother father children

What do you mean father

The Marquis dAigrigny replied Dagobert Do you know what is this
man Before he was a priest he was the murderer of Rose and Blanches
mother because she despised his love Before he was a priest he fought
against his country and twice met General Simon face to face in war
Yes while the general was prisoner at Leipsic covered with wounds
at Waterloo the turncoat marquis triumphed with the Russians and
EnglishUnder the Bourbons this same renegade loaded with honors
found himself once more face to face with the persecuted soldier of the
empire Between them this time there was a mortal duelthe marquis
was woundedGeneral Simon was proscribed condemned driven into exile
The renegade you say has become a priest Well I am now certain that
it is he who has carried off Rose and Blanche in order to wreak on them
his hatred of their father and mother It is the infamous DAigrigny
who holds them in his power It is no longer the fortune of these
children that I have to defend it is their lifedo you hear what I
saytheir very life

What father do you think this man capable

A traitor to his country who finishes by becoming a mock priest is
capable of anything I tell you that perhaps at this moment he may
be killing those children by a slowfire exclaimed the soldier in a
voice of agony To separate them from one another was to begin to kill
them Yes added Dagobert with an exasperation impossible to describe
the daughters of Marshal Simon are in the power of the Marquis
dAigrigny and his band and I hesitate to attempt their rescue for
fear of the galleys The galleys added he with a convulsive burst of
laughter what do I care for the galleys Can they send a corpse there
If this last attempt fail shall I not have the right to blow my brains
outPut the iron in the fire my boyquick time pressesand strike
while the irons hot

But your son goes with you exclaimed Frances with a cry of maternal
despair Then rising she threw herself at the feet of Dagobert and
said If you are arrested he will be arrested also

To escape the galleys he will do as I do I have two pistols

And without youwithout him cried the unhappy mother extending her
hands in supplication what will become of me

You are rightI was too selfish said Dagobert I will go alone

You shall not go alone father replied Agricola

But your mother

Mother Bunch sees what is passing she will go to Mr Hardy my master
and tell him all He is the most generous of men and my mother will
have food and shelter for the rest of her days

And I am the cause of all cried Frances wringing her hands in
despair Punish me oh heaven for it is my fault I gave up those
children I shall be punished by the death of my child

Agricola you shall not go with meI forbid it said Dagobert
clasping his son closely to his breast

What when I have pointed out the danger am I to be the first to
shrink from it you cannot think thus lowly of me father Have I not
also some one to deliver The good the generous Mdlle de Cardoville
who tried to save me from a prison is a captive in her turn I will
follow you father It is my right my duty my determination

So saying Agricola put into the heated stove the tongs that were
intended to form the hook Alas may heaven have pity upon us cried
his poor mother sobbing as she still knelt whilst the soldier seemed a
prey to the most violent internal struggle

Do not cry so dear mother you will break my heart said Agricola
as he raised her with the sempstresss help Be comforted I have
exaggerated the danger of my father By acting prudently we two may
succeed in our enterprise without much riskeh father added he
with a significant glance at Dagobert Once more be comforted dear
mother I will answer for everything We will deliver Marshal Simons
daughters and Mdlle de Cardoville too Sister give me the hammer and
pincers there in the press

The sempstress drying her tears did as desired while Agricola by the
help of bellows revived the fire in which the tongs were heating

Here are your tools Agricola said the hunchback in a
deeplyagitated voice as she presented them with trembling hands to
the smith who with the aid of the pincers soon drew from the fire
the whitehot tongs and with vigorous blows of the hammer formed them
into a hook taking the stove for his anvil

Dagobert had remained silent and pensive Suddenly he said to Frances
taking her by the hand You know what metal your son is To prevent his
following me would now be impossible But do not be afraid dear wife
we shall succeedat least I hope so And if we should not succeedif
Agricola and me should be arrestedwell we are not cowards we shall
not commit suicide but father and son will go arm in arm to prison
with heads high and proud look like two brave men who have done their
duty The day of trial must come and we will explain all honestly
openlywe will say that driven to the last extremity finding no
support no protection in the law we were forced to have recourse to
violence So hammer away my boy added Dagobert addressing his son
pounding the hot iron forge forge without fear Honest judges will
absolve honest men

Yes father you are right be at ease dear mother The judges will see
the difference between rascals who scale walls in order to rob and
an old soldier and his son who at peril of their liberty their life
their honor have sought only to deliver unhappy victims

And if this language should not be heard resumed Dagobert so much
the worse for them It will not be your son or husband who will be
dishonored in the eyes of honest people If they send us to the galleys
and we have courage to survivethe young and the old convict will wear
their chains proudlyand the renegade marquis the traitor priest
will bear more shame than we So forge without fear my boy There are
things which the galleys themselves cannot disgraceour good conscience
and our honor But now he added two words with my good Mother Bunch
It grows late and time presses On entering the garden did you remark
if the windows of the convent were far from the ground

No not very far M Dagobertparticularly on that side which is
opposite to the madhouse where Mdlle de Cardoville is confined

How did you manage to speak to that young lady

She was on the other side of an open paling which separates the two
gardens

Excellent said Agricola as he continued to hammer the iron we can
easily pass from one garden to the other The madhouse may perhaps
be the readier way out Unfortunately you do not know Mdlle de
Cardovilles chamber

Yes I do returned the workgirl recollecting herself She is
lodged in one of the wings and there is a shade over her window
painted like canvas with blue and white stripes

Good I shall not forget that

And can you form no guess as to where are the rooms of my poor
children said Dagobert

After a moments reflection Mother Bunch answered They are opposite
to the chamber occupied by Mdlle de Cardoville for she makes signs
to them from her window and I now remember she told me that their two
rooms are on different stories one on the groundfloor and the other
up one pair of stairs

Are these windows grated asked the smith

I do not know

Never mind my good girl with these indications we shall do very
well said Dagobert For the rest I have my plans

Some water my little sister said Agricola that I may cool my
iron Then addressing his father Will this hook do

Yes my boy as soon as it is cold we will fasten the cord

For some time Frances Baudoin had remained upon her knees praying with
fervor She implored Heaven to have pity on Agricola and Dagobert
who in their ignorance were about to commit a great crime and she
entreated that the celestial vengeance might fall upon her only as she
alone had been the cause of the fatal resolution of her son and husband

Dagobert and Agricola finished their preparations in silence They
were both very pale and solemnly grave They felt all the danger of so
desperate an enterprise

The clock at SaintMerys struck ten The sound of the bell was faint
and almost drowned by the lashing of the wind and rain which had not
ceased for a moment

Ten oclock said Dagobert with a start There is not a minute to
lose Take the sack Agricola

Yes father

As he went to fetch the sack Agricola approached Mother Bunch who was
hardly able to sustain herself and said to her in a rapid whisper If
we are not here tomorrow take care of my mother Go to M Hardy who
will perhaps have returned from his journey Courage my sister embrace
me I leave poor mother to you The smith deeply affected pressed the
almost fainting girl in his arms

Come old Spoilsport said Dagobert you shall be our scout
Approaching his wife who just risen from the ground was clasping her
sons head to her bosom and covering it with tears and kisses he said
to her with a semblance of calmness and serenity Come my dear wife
be reasonable Make us a good fire In two or three hours we will bring
home the two poor children and a fine young lady Kiss me that will
bring me luck

Frances threw herself on her husbands neck without uttering a word
This mute despair mingled with convulsive sobs was heartrending
Dagobert was obliged to tear himself from his wifes arms and striving
to conceal his emotion he said to his son in an agitated voice
Let us goshe unmans me Take care of her my good Mother Bunch
Agricolacome

The soldier slipped the pistols into the pocket of his great coat and
rushed towards the door followed by Spoilsport

My son let me embrace you once morealas it is perhaps for the last
time cried the unfortunate mother incapable of rising but stretching
out her arms to Agricola Forgive me it is all my fault

The smith turned back mingled his tears with those of his motherfor
he also weptand murmured in a stifled voice Adieu dear mother Be
comforted We shall soon meet again

Then escaping from the embrace he joined his father upon the stairs

Frances Baudoin heaved a long sigh and fell almost lifeless into the
needlewomans arms

Dagobert and Agricola left the Rue BriseMiche in the height of
the storm and hastened with great strides towards the Boulevard de
lHopital followed by the dog




CHAPTER XIII BURGLARY

Halfpast eleven had just struck when Dagobert and his son arrived on
the Boulevard de lHopital

The wind blew violently and the rain fell down in torrents but
notwithstanding the thickness of the watery clouds it was tolerably
light thanks to the late rising of the moon The tall dark trees and
the white walls of the convent garden were distinguishable in the midst
of the pale glimmer Afar off a street lamp acted on by the wind with
its red lights hardly visible through the mist and rain swung backwards
and forwards over the dirty causeway of the solitary boulevard

At rare intervals they heard at a very great distance the rattle and
rumble of a coach returning home late then all was again silent

Since their departure from the Rue BriseMiche Dagobert and his son had
hardly exchanged a word The design of these two brave men was noble
and generous and yet resolute but pensive they glided through the
darkness like bandits at the hour of nocturnal crimes

Agricola carried on his shoulders the sack containing the cord the
hook and the iron bar Dagobert leaned upon the arm of his son and
Spoil sport followed his master

The bench where we sat down must be close by said Dagobert
stopping

Yes said Agricola looking around here it is father

It is oily halfpast elevenwe must wait for midnight resumed
Dagobert Let us be seated for an instant to rest ourselves and
decide upon our plan

After a moments silence the soldier took his sons hands between his
own and thus continued Agricola my childit is yet time Let me
go alone I entreat you I shall know very well how to get through the
business but the nearer the moment comes the more I fear to drag you
into this dangerous enterprise

And the nearer the moment comes father the more I feel I may be
of some use but be it good or bad I will share the fortune of your
adventure Our object is praiseworthy it is a debt of honor that you
have to pay and I will take one half of it Do not fancy that I will
now draw back And so dear father let us think of our plan of action

Then you will come said Dagobert stifling a sigh

We must do everything proceeded Agricola to secure success You
have already noticed the little gardendoor near the angle of the
wallthat is excellent

We shall get by that way into the garden and look immediately for the
open paling

Yes for on one side of this paling is the wing inhabited by Mdlle
de Cardoville and on the other that part of the convent in which the
generals daughters are confined

At this moment Spoilsport who was crouching at Dagoberts feet rose
suddenly and pricked up his ears as if to listen

One would think that Spoilsport heard something said Agricola They
listenedbut heard only the wind sounding through the tall trees of
the boulevard

Now I think of it fatherwhen the gardendoor is once open shall we
take Spoilsport with us

Yes for if there is a watchdog he will settle him And then he will
give us notice of the approach of those who go the rounds Besides he
is so intelligent so attached to Rose and Blanche that who knows he
may help to discover the place where they are Twenty times I have seen
him find them in the woods by the most extraordinary instinct

A slow and solemn knell here rose above the noise of the wind it was
the first stroke of twelve

That note seemed to echo mournfully through the souls of Agricola and
his father Mute with emotion they shuddered and by a spontaneous
movement each grasped the hand of the other In spite of themselves
their hearts kept time to every stroke of the clock as each successive
vibration was prolonged through the gloomy silence of the night

At the last strobe Dagobert said to his son in a firm voice It is
midnight Shake hands and let us forward

The moment was decisive and solemn Now father said Agricola we
will act with as much craft and daring as thieves going to pillage a
strong box

So saying the smith took from the sack the cord and hook Dagobert
armed himself with the iron bar and both advanced cautiously following
the wall in the direction of the little door situated not far from the
angle formed by the street and the boulevard They stopped from time to
time to listen attentively trying to distinguish those noises which
were not caused either by the high wind or the rain

It continued light enough for them to be able to see surrounding
objects and the smith and the soldier soon gained the little door
which appeared much decayed and not very strong

Good said Agricola to his father It will yield at one blow

The smith was about to apply his shoulder vigorously to the door when
Spoilsport growled hoarsely and made a point Dagobert silenced the
dog with a word and grasping his sons arm said to him in a whisper
Do not stir The dog has scented some one in the garden

Agricola and his father remained for some minutes motionless holding
their breath and listening The dog in obedience to his master no
longer growled but his uneasiness and agitation were displayed more and
more Yet they heard nothing

The dog must have been deceived father whispered Agricola

I am sure of the contrary Do not move

After some seconds of expectation Spoilsport crouched down abruptly
and pushed his nose as far as possible under the door snuffling up the
air

They are coming said Dagobert hastily to his son

Let us draw off a little distance replied Agricola

No said his father we must listen It will be time to retire if
they open the door Here Spoilsport down

The dog obeyed and withdrawing from the door crouched down at the feet
of his master Some seconds after they heard a sort of splashing on the
damp ground caused by heavy footsteps in puddles of water and then the
sound of words which carried away by the wind did not reach distinctly
the ears of the soldier and the smith

They are the people of whom Mother Bunch told us going their round
said Agricola to his father

So much the better There will be an interval before they come round
again and we shall have some two hours before us without interruption
Our affair is all right now

By degrees the sound of the footsteps became less and less distinct
and at last died away altogether

Now quick we must not lose any time said Dagobert to his son after
waiting about ten minutes they are far enough Let us try to open the
door

Agricola leaned his powerful shoulder against it and pushed vigorously
but the door did not give way notwithstanding its age

Confound it said Agricola there is a bar on the inside I am sure
of it or these old planks would not have resisted my weight

What is to be done

I will scale the wall by means of the cord and hook and open the door
from the other side

So saying Agricola took the cord and after several attempts succeeded
in fixing the hook on the coping of the wall

Now father give me a leg up I will help myself up with the cord
once astride on the wall I can easily turn the hook and get down into
the garden

The soldier leaned against the wall and joined his two hands in the
hollow of which his son placed one of his feet then mounting upon the
robust shoulders of his father he was able by help of the cord and
some irregularities in the wall to reach the top Unfortunately the
smith had not perceived that the coping of the wall was strewed with
broken bottles so that he wounded his knees and hands but for fear of
alarming Dagobert he repressed every exclamation of pain and replacing
the hook he glided down the cord to the ground The door was close by
and he hastened to it a strong wooden bar had indeed secured it on the
inside This was removed and the lock was in so bad a state that it
offered no resistance to a violent effort from Agricola

The door was opened and Dagobert entered the garden with Spoilsport

Now said the soldier to his son thanks to you the worst is
over Here is a means of escape for the poor children and Mdlle de
Cardoville The thing is now to find them without accident or delay
Spoilsport will go before as a scout Come my good dog added
Dagobert above allfair and softly

Immediately the intelligent animal advanced a few steps sniffing and
listening with the care and caution of a hound searching for the game

By the halflight of the clouded moon Dagobert and his son perceived
round them a Vshaped grove of tall trees at which several paths met
Uncertain which to choose Agricola said to his father Let us take
the path that runs alongside the wall It will surely lead to some
building

Right Let us walk on the strips of grass instead of through the mud
It will make less noise

The father and son preceded by the Siberian dog kept for some time in
a winding path at no great distance from the wall They stopped now
and then to listen or to satisfy themselves before continuing their
advance with regard to the changing aspects of the trees and bushes
which shaken by the wind and faintly illumined by the pale light of
the moon often took strange and doubtful forms

Halfpast twelve struck as Agricola and his father reached a large
iron gate which shut in that part of the garden reserved for the
Superiorthe same into which Mother Bunch had intruded herself after
seeing Rose Simon converse with Adrienne de Cardoville

Through the bars of this gate Agricola and his father perceived at a
little distance an open paling which joined a halffinished chapel and
beyond it a little square building

That is no doubt the building occupied by Mdlle de Cardoville said
Agricola

And the building which contains the chambers of Rose and Blanche but
which we cannot see from here is no doubt opposite it said Dagobert
Poor children they are there weeping tears of despair added he
with profound emotion

Provided the gate be but open said Agricola

It will probably be sobeing within the walls

Let us go on gently

The gate was only fastened by the catch of the lock Dagobert was about
to open it when Agricola said to him Take care do not make it creak
on its hinges

Shall I push it slowly or suddenly

Let me manage it said Agricola and he opened the gate so quickly
that it creaked very little still the noise might have been plainly
heard in the silence of the night during one of the lulls between the
squalls of wind

Agricola and his father remained motionless for a moment listening
uneasily before they ventured to pass through the gate Nothing
stirred however all remained calm and still With fresh courage they
entered the reserved garden

Hardly had the dog arrived on this spot when he exhibited tokens of
extraordinary delight Picking up his ears wagging his tail bounding
rather than running he had soon reached the paling where in
the morning Rose Simon had for a moment conversed with Mdlle de
Cardoville He stopped an instant at this place as if at fault and
turned round and round like a dog seeking the scent

Dagobert and his son leaving Spoilsport to his instinct followed
his least movements with intense interest hoping everything from his
intelligence and his attachment to the orphans

It was no doubt near this paling that Rose stood when Mother Bunch saw
her said Dagobert Spoilsport is on her track Let him alone

After a few seconds the dog turned his head towards Dagobert and
started at full trot in the direction of a door on the groundfloor of
a building opposite to that occupied by Adrienne Arrived at this door
the dog lay down seemingly waiting for Dagobert

No doubt of it the children are there said Dagobert hastening to
rejoin Spoilsport it was by this door that they took Rose into the
house

We must see if the windows are grated said Agricola following his
father

Well old fellow whispered the soldier as he came up to the dog and
pointed to the building are Rose and Blanche there

The dog lifted his head and answered by a joyful bark Dagobert had
just time to seize the mouth of the animal with his hands

He will ruin all exclaimed the smith They have perhaps heard
him

No said Dagobert But there is no longer any doubtthe children are
here

At this instant the iron gate by which the soldier and his son had
entered the reserved garden and which they had left open fell to with
a loud noise

Theyve shut us in said Agricola hastily and there is no other
issue

For a moment the father and son looked in dismay at each other but
Agricola instantly resumed The gate has perhaps shut of itself I will
make haste to assure myself of this and to open it again if possible

Go quickly I will examine the windows

Agricola flew towards the gate whilst Dagobert gliding along the wall
soon reached the windows on the ground floor They were four in number
and two of them were not grated He looked up at the first story it was
not very far from the ground and none of the windows had bars It would
then be easy for that one of the two sisters who inhabited this story
once informed of their presence to let herself down by means of a
sheet as the orphans had already done to escape from the inn of
the White Falcon But the difficult thing was to know which room she
occupied Dagobert thought they might learn this from the sister on the
ground floor but then there was another difficultyat which of the
four windows should they knock

Agricola returned precipitately It was the wind no doubt which shut
the gate said he I have opened it again and made it fast with a
stone But we have no time to lose

And how shall we know the windows of the poor children said Dagobert
anxiously

That is true said Agricola with uneasiness What is to be done

To call them at haphazard continued Dagobert would be to give the
alarm

Oh heavens cried Agricola with increasing anguish To have arrived
here under their windows and yet not to know

Time presses said Dagobert hastily interrupting his son we must
run all risks

But how father

I will call out loud Rose and Blanchein their state of despair I
am sure they do not sleep They will be stirring at my first summons By
means of a sheet fastened to the window she who is on the first
story will in five minutes be in our arms As for the one on the ground
floorif her window is not grated we can have her in a second If it
is we shall soon loosen one of the bars

But fatherthis calling out aloud

Will not perhaps be heard

But if it is heardall will be lost

Who knows Before they have time to call the watch and open several
doors the children may be delivered Once at the entrance of the
boulevard and we shall be safe

It is a dangerous course but I see no other

If there are only two men I and Spoilsport will keep them in check
while you will have time to carry off the children

Father there is a better waya surer one cried Agricola suddenly
From what Mother Bunch told us Mdlle de Cardoville has corresponded
by signs with Rose and Blanche

Yes

Hence she knows where they are lodged as the poor children answered
her from their windows

You are right There is only that course to take But how find her
room

Mother Bunch told me there was a shade over the window

Quick we have only to break through a wooden fence Have you the iron
bar

Here it is

Then quick

In a few steps Dagobert and his son had reached the paling Three
planks torn away by Agricola opened an easy passage

Remain here father and keep watch said he to Dagobert as he
entered Dr Baleiniers garden

The indicated window was easily recognized It was high and broad a
sort of shade surmounted it for this window had once been a door since
walled in to the third of its height It was protected by bars of iron
pretty far apart Since some minutes the rain had ceased The moon
breaking through the clouds shone full upon the building Agricola
approaching the window saw that the room was perfectly dark but light
came from a room beyond through a door left half open The smith
hoping that Mdlle de Cardoville might be still awake tapped lightly at
the window Soon after the door in the background opened entirely and
Mdlle de Cardoville who had not yet gone to bed came from the other
chamber dressed as she had been at her interview with Mother Bunch Her
charming features were visible by the light of the taper she held in
her hand Their present expression was that of surprise and anxiety The
young girl set down the candlestick on the table and appeared to listen
attentively as she approached the window Suddenly she started and
stopped abruptly She had just discerned the face of a man looking
at her through the window Agricola fearing that Mdlle de Cardoville
would retire in terror to the next room again tapped on the glass and
running the risk of being heard by others said in a pretty loud voice
It is Agricola Baudoin

These words reached the ears of Adrienne Instantly remembering her
interview with Mother Bunch she thought that Agricola and Dagobert
must have entered the convent for the purpose of carrying off Rose
and Blanche She ran to the window recognized Agricola in the clear
moonlight and cautiously opened the casement

Madame said the smith hastily there is not an instant to lose
The Count de Montbron is not in Paris My father and myself have come to
deliver you

Thanks thanks M Agricola said Mdlle de Cardoville in a tone
expressive of the most touching gratitude but think first of the
daughters of General Simon

We do think of them madame I have come to ask you which are their
windows

One is on the ground floor the last on the gardenside the other is
exactly over it on the first story

Then they are saved cried the smith

But let me see resumed Adrienne hastily the first story is pretty
high You will find near the chapel they are building some long poles
belonging to the scaffolding They may be of use to you

They will be as good as a ladder to reach the upstairs window But now
to think of you madame

Think only of the dear orphans Time presses Provided they are
delivered tonight it makes little difference to me to remain a day or
two longer in this house

No mademoiselle cried the smith it is of the first importance that
you should leave this place tonight Interests are concerned of which
you know nothing I am now sure of it

What do you mean

I have not time to explain myself further but I conjure you madame to
come I can wrench out two of these bars I will fetch a piece of iron

It is not necessary They are satisfied with locking the outer door
of this building which I inhabit alone You can easily break open the
lock

And in ten minutes we shall be on the boulevard said the smith
Make yourself ready madame take a shawl a bonnet for the night is
cold I will return instantly

M Agricola said Adrienne with tears in her eyes I know what you
risk for my sake I shall prove to you I hope that I have as good a
memory as you have You and your adopted sister are noble and valiant
creatures and I am proud to be indebted to you But do not return for
me till the daughters of Marshal Simon are in safety

Thanks to your directions the thing will be done directly madame I
fly to rejoin my father and we will come together to fetch you

Following the excellent advice of Mdlle de Cardoville Agricola took
one of the long strong poles that rested against the wall of the
chapel and bearing it on his robust shoulders hastened to rejoin
his father Hardly had Agricola passed the fence to direct his steps
towards the chapel obscured in shadow than Mdlle de Cardoville
thought she perceived a human form issue from one of the clumps of trees
in the conventgarden cross the path hastily and disappear behind
a high hedge of box Alarmed at the sight Adrienne in vain called to
Agricola in a low voice to bid him beware He could not hear her he
had already rejoined his father who devoured by impatience went from
window to window with everincreasing anguish

We are saved whispered Agricola Those are the windows of the poor
childrenone on the ground floor the other on the first story

At last said Dagobert with a burst of joy impossible to describe He
ran to examine the windows They are not grated he exclaimed

Let us make sure that one of them is there said Agricola then by
placing this pole against the wall I will climb up to the first story
which is not so very high

Right my boyonce there tap at the window and call Rose or
Blanche When she answers come down We will rest the pole against
the window and the poor child will slide along it They are bold and
active Quick quick to work

And then we will deliver Mdlle de Cardoville

Whilst Agricola placed his pole against the wall and prepares to mount
Dagobert tapped at the panes of the last window on the ground floor and
said aloud It is IDagobert

Rose Simon indeed occupied the chamber The unhappy child in despair
at being separated from her sister was a prey to a burning fever and
unable to sleep watered her pillow with her tears At the sound of the
tapping on the glass she started up affrighted then hearing the voice
of the soldierthat voice so familiar and so dearshe sat up in bed
pressed her hands across her forehead to assure herself that she was
not the plaything of a dream and wrapped in her long nightdress ran
to the window with a cry of joy But suddenlyand before she could open
the casementtwo reports of firearms were heard accompanied by loud
cries of Help thieves

The orphan stood petrified with terror her eyes mechanically fixed upon
the window through which she saw confusedly by the light of the moon
several men engaged in a mortal struggle whilst the furious barking
of Spoilsport was heard above all the incessant cries of Help Help

CHAPTER XIV THE EVE OF A GREAT DAY

About two hours before the event last related took place at St Marys
Convent Rodin and Abbe dAigrigny met in the room where we have already
seen them in the Rue du MilieudesUrsins Since the Revolution of
July Father dAigrigny had thought proper to remove for the moment to
this temporary habitation all the secret archives and correspondence of
his Ordera prudent measure since he had every reason to fear that the
reverend fathers would be expelled by the state from that magnificent
establishment with which the restoration had so liberally endowed their
society 11

Rodin dressed in his usual sordid style mean and dirty as ever was
writing modestly at his desk faithful to his humble part of secretary
which concealed as we have already seen a far more important
officethat of Sociusa function which according to the constitutions
of the Order consists in never quitting his superior watching his
least actions spying into his very thoughts and reporting all to Rome

In spite of his usual impassibility Rodin appeared visibly uneasy and
absent in mind he answered even more briefly than usual to the commands
and questions of Father dAigrigny who had but just entered the room

Has anything new occurred during my absence asked he Are the
reports still favorable

Very favorable

Read them to me

Before giving this account to your reverence said Rodin I must
inform you that Morok has been two days in Paris

Morok said Abbe dAigrigny with surprise I thought on leaving
Germany and Switzerland he had received from Friburg the order to
proceed southward At Nismes or Avignon he would at this moment be
useful as an agent for the Protestants begin to move and we fear a
reaction against the Catholics

I do not know said Rodin if Morok may not have had private reasons
for changing his route His ostensible reasons are that he comes here
to give performances

How so

A dramatic agent passing through Lyons engaged him and his menagerie
for the Port SaintMartin Theatre at a very high price He says that he
did not like to refuse such an offer

Well said Father dAigrigny shrugging his shoulders but by
distributing his little books and selling prints and chaplets as
well as by the influence he would certainly exercise over the pious and
ignorant people of the South or of Brittany he might render services
such as he can never perform in Paris

He is now below with a kind of giant who travels about with him In
his capacity of your reverences old servant Morok hoped to have the
honor of kissing your hand this evening

Impossibleimpossibleyou know how much I am occupied Have you sent
to the Rue SaintFrancois

Yes I have The old Jew guardian has had notice from the notary To
morrow at six in the morning the masons will unwall the door and
for the first time since one hundred and fifty years the house will be
opened

Father dAigrigny remained in thought for a moment and then said to
Rodin On the eve of such a decisive day we must neglect nothing
and call every circumstance to memory Read me the copy of the note
inserted in the archives of the society a century and a half ago on
the subject of Rennepont

The secretary took the note from the case and read as follows

This 19th day of February 1682 the Reverend FatherProvincial
Alexander Bourdon sent the following advice with these words in the
margin Of extreme importance for the future

We have just discovered by the confession of a dying person to one of
our fathers a very close secret

Marius de Rennepont one of the most active and redoubtable partisans
of the Reformed Religion and one of the most determined enemies of our
Holy Society had apparently reentered the pale of our Mother Church
but with the sole design of saving his worldly goods threatened with
confiscation because of his irreligious and damnable errors Evidence
having been furnished by different persons of our company to prove that
the conversion of Rennepont was not sincere and in reality covered a
sacrilegious lure the possessions of the said gentleman now considered
a relapsed heretic were confiscated by our gracious sovereign his
Majesty King Louis XIV and the said Rennepont was condemned to the
galleys for life12 He escaped his doom by a voluntary death in
consequence of which abominable crime his body was dragged upon a
hurdle and flung to the dogs on the highway

From these preliminaries we come to the great secret which is of
such importance to the future interests of our Society

His Majesty Louis XIV in his paternal and Catholic goodness towards
the Church in general and our Order in particular had granted to us
the profit of this confiscation in acknowledgment of our services in
discovering the infamous and sacrilegious relapse of the said Rennepont

But we have just learned for certain that a house situated in Paris
No 3 Rue SaintFrancois and a sum of fifty thousand gold crowns have
escaped this confiscation and have consequently been stolen from our
Society

The house was conveyed before the confiscation by means of a feigned
purchase to a friend of Renneponts a good Catholic unfortunately as
against him we cannot take any severe measures Thanks to the culpable
but secure connivance of his friend the house has been walled up and
is only to be opened in a century and a half according to the last
will of Rennepont As for the fifty thousand gold crowns they have been
placed in hands which unfortunately are hitherto unknown to us in
order to be invested and put out to use for one hundred and fifty years
at the expiration of which time they are to be divided between the then
existing descendants of the said Rennepont and it is calculated that
this sum increased by so many accumulations will by then have become
enormous and will amount to at least forty or fifty millions of livres
tournois From motives which are not known but which are duly stated
in a testamentary document the said Rennepont has concealed from his
family whom the edicts against the Protestants have driven out of
France the investment of these fifty thousand crowns and has only
desired his relations to preserve in their line from generation to
generation the charge to the last survivors to meet in Paris Rue
SaintFrancois a hundred and fifty years hence on February the 13th
1832 And that this charge might not be forgotten he employed a person
whose description is known but not his real occupation to cause to
be manufactured sundry bronze medals on which the request and date are
engraved and to deliver one to each member of the familya measure the
more necessary as from some other motive equally unknown but probably
explained in the testament the heirs are to present themselves on the
day in question before noon in person and not by any attorney or
representative or to forfeit all claim to the inheritance The stranger
who undertook to distribute the medals to the different members of the
family of Rennepont is a man of thirty to thirtysix years of age of
tall stature and with a proud and sad expression of countenance He has
black eyebrows very thick and singularly joined together He is
known as JOSEPH and is much suspected of being an active and dangerous
emissary of the wretched republicans and heretics of the Seven
United Provinces It results from these premises that this sum
surreptitiously confided by a relapsed heretic to unknown hands has
escaped the confiscation decreed in our favor by our wellbeloved king
A serious fraud and injury has therefore been committed and we are
bound to take every means to recover this our right if not immediately
at least in some future time Our Society being for the greater glory
of God and our Holy Father imperishable it will be easy thanks to the
connections we keep up with all parts of the world by means of missions
and other establishments to follow the line of this family of Rennepont
from generation to generation without ever losing sight of itso that
a hundred and fifty years hence at the moment of the division of this
immense accumulation of property our Company may claim the inheritance
of which it has been so treacherously deprived and recover it by
any means in its power fas aut nefas even by craft or violenceour
Company not being bound to act tenderly with the future detainers of
our goods of which we have been maliciously deprived by an infamous and
sacrilegious hereticand because it is right to defend preserve
and recover ones own property by every means which the Lord may place
within ones reach Until therefore the complete restitution of this
wealth the family of Rennepont must be considered as reprobate and
damnable as the cursed seed of a Cain and always to be watched with
the utmost caution And it is to be recommended that every year
from this present date a sort of inquisition should be held as to the
situation of the successive members of this family

Rodin paused and said to Father dAigrigny Here follows the account
year by year of the history of this family from the year 1682 to our
own day It will be useless to read this to your reverence

Quite useless said Abbe dAigrigny The note contains all the
important facts Then after a moments silence he exclaimed with
an expression of triumphant pride How great is the power of the
Association when founded upon tradition and perpetuity Thanks to this
note inserted in our archives a century and a half ago this family has
been watched from generation to generationour Order has always had
its eyes upon them following them to all points of the globe to which
exile had distributed themand at last tomorrow we shall obtain
possession of this property at first inconsiderable but which a
hundred and fifty years have raised to a royal fortune Yes we shall
succeed for we have foreseen every eventuality One thing only troubles
me

What is that asked Rodin

The information that we have in vain tried to obtain from the guardian
of the house in the Rue SaintFrancois Has the attempt been once more
made as I directed

It has been made

Well

This time as always before the old Jew has remained impenetrable
Besides he is almost in his second childhood and his wife not much
better

When I think resumed Father dAigrigny that for a century and a
half this house in the Rue SaintFrancois has remained walled up and
that the care of it has been transmitted from generation to generation
in this family of the SamuelsI cannot suppose that they have all been
ignorant as to who were and are the successive holders of these funds
now become immense by accumulation

You have seen said Rodin by the notes upon this affair that the
Order has always carefully followed it up ever since 1682 At different
periods attempts have been made to obtain information upon subjects
not fully explained in the note of Father Bourdon But this race of Jew
guardians has ever remained dumb and we must therefore conclude that
they know nothing about it

That has always struck me as impossible for the ancestor of these
Samuels was present at the closing of the house a hundred and fifty
years ago He was according to the file a servant or confidential clerk
of De Rennepont It is impossible that he should not have known many
things the tradition of which must have been preserved in the family

If I were allowed to hazard a brief observation began Rodin humbly

Speak

A few years ago we obtained certain information through the
confessional that the funds were in existence and that they had risen
to an enormous amount

Doubtless and it was that which called the attention of the Reverend
FatherGeneral so strongly to this affair

We know then what probably the descendants of the family do notthe
immense value of this inheritance

Yes answered Father dAigrigny the person who certified this fact
in confession is worthy of all belief Only lately the same declaration
was renewed but all the efforts of the confessor could not obtain the
name of the trustee or anything beyond the assertion that the money
could not be in more honest hands

It seems to me then resumed Rodin that we are certain of what is
most important

And who knows if the holder of this enormous sum will appear tomorrow
in spite of the honesty ascribed to him The nearer the moment the more
my anxiety increases Ah continued Father dAigrigny after a moments
silence the interests concerned are so immense that the consequences
of success are quite incalculable However all that it was possible to
do has been at least tried

To these words which Father dAigrigny addressed to Rodin as if asking
for his assent the socius returned no answer

The abbe looked at him with surprise and said Are you not of my
opinioncould more have been attempted Have we not gone to the extreme
limit of the possible

Rodin bowed respectfully but remained mute

If you think we have omitted some precaution cried Father dAigrigny
with a sort of uneasy impatience speak out We have still time Once
more do you think it is possible to do more than I have done All the
other descendants being removed when Gabriel appears tomorrow in
the Rue SaintFrancois will he not be the only representative of this
family and consequently the rightful possessor of this immense fortune
Now according to his act of renunciation and the provisions of our
statutes it is not to him but to the Order that these possessions
must fall Could I have acted better or in any other manner Speak
frankly

I cannot permit myself to offer an opinion on this subject replied
Rodin humbly and again bowing the success of the measures taken must
answer your reverence

Father dAigrigny shrugged his shoulders and reproached himself for
having asked advice of this writingmachine that served him for
a secretary and to whom he only ascribed three qualitiesmemory
discretion and exactness

11 This was an idle fear for we read in the Constitutionnel Feb 1st
1832 as follows When in 1822 M de Corbiere abruptly abolished that
splendid Normal School which during its few years existence had
called forth or developed such a variety of talent it was decided
as some compensation that a house in the Rue des Postes should be
purchased where the congregation of the Holy Ghost should be located
and endowed The Minister of Marine supplied the funds for this purpose
and its management was placed at the disposal of the Society which then
reigned over France From that period it has held quiet possession of
the place which at once became a sort of house of entertainment where
Jesuitism sheltered and provided for the numerous novitiates that
flocked from all parts of the country to receive instructions from
Father Ronsin Matters were in this state when the Revolution of
July broke out which threatened to deprive the Society of this
establishment But it will hardly be believed this was not done It
is true that they suppressed their practice but they left them in
possession of the house in the Rue des Postes and to this very day the
31st of January 1832 the members of the Sacred Heart are housed at the
expense of government during the whole of which time the Normal School
has been without a shelterand on its reorganization thrust into a
dirty hole in a narrow corner of the College of Louis the Great

The above appeared in the Constitutionnel respecting the house in
the Rue des Posses We are certainly ignorant as to the nature of the
transactions since that period that have taken place between the
reverend fathers and the government but we read further in a recently
published article that appeared in a journal in reference to the
Society of Jesus that the house in the Rue des Postes still forms a
part of their landed property We will here give some portions of the
article in question

The following is a list of the property belonging to this branch of

 Jesuits Fr
 House in the Rue de Postes worth about 500000
 One in the Rue de Sevres estimated at 300000
 Farm two leagues from Paris150000
 House and church at Bourges 100000
 Notre Dame de Liesse donation in 1843 60000
 Saint Acheul House for Novitiates 400000
 Nantes a house100000
 Quimper ditto 40000
 Laval house and church 150000
 Rennes a house 20000
 Vannes ditto 20000
 Metz ditto 40000
 Strasbourg 60000
 Rouen ditto 15000

By this it appears that these various items amount to little less than
two millions Teaching moreover is another important source of revenue
to the Jesuits The college at Broyclette alone brings in 200000
francs The two provinces in France for the general of the Jesuits at
Rome has divided France into two provinces Lyons and Paris possess
besides a large sum in ready money Austrian bonds of more than 260000
francs Their Propagation of Faith furnishes annually some 50000
francs and the harvest which the priests collect by their sermons
amounts to 150000 francs The alms given for charity may be estimated
at the same figure producing together a revenue of 540000 francs Now
to this revenue may be added the produce of the sale of the Societys
works and the profit obtained by hawking pictures Each plate costs
design and engraving included about 600 francs off which are struck
about 10000 copies at 40 francs per thousand and there is a further
expense of 250 francs to their publisher and they obtain a net profit
of 210 francs on every thousand This indeed is working to advantage
And it can easily be imagined with what rapidity all these are sold The
fathers themselves are the travellers for the Society and it would be
difficult to find more zealous or persevering ones They are always well
received and do not know what it is to meet with a refusal They always
take care that the publisher should be one of their own body The first
person whom they selected for this occupation was one of their members
possessing some money but they were obliged notwithstanding to make
certain advances to enable him to defray the expenses of its first
establishment But when they became fully convinced of the success of
their undertaking they suddenly called in these advances which the
publisher was not in a condition to pay They were perfectly aware of
this and superseded him by a wealthy successor with whom they could
make a better bargain and thus without remorse they ruined the
man by thrusting him from an appointment of which they had morally
guaranteed the continuance

12 Louis XIV the great King punished with the Galleys those
Protestants who once converted often by force afterwards returned
to their first belief As for those Protestants who remained in France
notwithstanding the rigor of the edicts against them they were deprived
of burial dragged upon a hurdle and given to the dogsE S




CHAPTER XV THE THUG

After a moments silence Father dAigrigny resumed Read me todays
report on the situation of each of the persons designated

Here is that of this evening it has just come

Let us hear

Rodin read as follows Jacques Rennepont alias Sleepinbuff was seen
in the interior of the debtors prison at eight oclock this evening

He will not disturb us tomorrow One go on

The lady superior of St Marys Convent warned by the Princess
de SaintDizier has thought fit to confine still more strictly the
Demoiselles Rose and Blanche Simon This evening at nine oclock they
have been carefully locked in their cells and armed men will make their
round in the convent garden during the night

Thanks to these precautions there is nothing to fear from that side
said Father dAigrigny Go on

Dr Baleinier also warned by the Princess de SaintDizier continues
to have Mdlle de Cardoville very closely watched At a quarter to nine
the door of the building in which she is lodged was locked and bolted

That is still another cause the less for uneasiness

As for M Hardy resumed Rodin I have received this morning from
Toulouse a letter from his intimate friend M de Bressac who has been
of such service to us in keeping the manufacturer away for some
days longer This letter contains a note addressed by M Hardy to a
confidential person which M de Bressac has thought fit to intercept
and send to us as another proof of the success of the steps he has
taken and for which he hopes we shall give him creditas to serve us
he adds he betrays his friend in the most shameful manner and acts a
part in an odious comedy M de Bressac trusts that in return for these
good offices we will deliver up to him those papers which place him
in our absolute dependence as they might ruin for ever a woman he loves
with an adulterous passion He says that we ought to have pity on the
horrible alternative in which he is placedeither to dishonor and ruin
the woman he adores or infamously to betray the confidence of his bosom
friend

These adulterous lamentations are not deserving of pity answered
Father dAigrigny with contempt We will see about that M de Bressac
may still be useful to us But let us hear this letter of M Hardy that
impious and republican manufacturer worthy descendant of an accursed
race whom it is of the first importance to keep away

Here is M Hardys letter resumed Rodin Tomorrow we will send it
to the person to whom it is addressed Rodin read as follows

TOULOUSE February the 10th

At length I find a moment to write to you and to explain the cause
of the sudden departure which without alarming must at least have
astonished you I write also to ask you a service the facts may be
stated in a few words I have often spoken to you of Felix de Bressac
one of my boyhood mates though not nearly so old as myself We have
always loved each other tenderly and have shown too many proofs of
mutual affection not to count upon one another He is a brother to me
You know all I mean by that expression Wella few days ago he wrote
to me from Toulouse where he was to spend some time If you love me
come I have the greatest need of you At once Your consolations
may perhaps give me the courage to live If you arrive too latewhy
forgive meand think sometimes of him who will be yours to the last
Judge of my grief and fear on receipt of the above I seat instantly
for posthorses My old foreman whom I esteem and revere the father of
General Simon hearing that I was going to the south begged me to take
him with me and to leave him for some days in the department of the
Creuse to examine some ironworks recently founded there I consented
willingly to this proposition as I should thus at least have some one
to whom I could pour out the grief and anxiety which had been caused
by this letter from Bressac I arrive at Toulouse they tell me that
he left the evening before taking arms with him a prey to the most
violent despair It was impossible at first to tell whither he had gone
after two days some indications collected with great trouble put me
upon his track At last after a thousand adventures I found him in a
miserable village Neverno never have I seen despair like this
No violence but a dreadful dejection a savage silence At first he
almost repulsed me then this horrible agony having reached its height
he softened by degrees and in about a quarter of an hour threw
himself into my arms bathed in tears Beside him were his loaded
pistols one day later and all would have been over I cannot tell you
the reason of his despair I am not at liberty to do so but it did not
greatly astonish me Now there is a complete cure to effect We must
calm and soothe and heal this poor soul which has been cruelly
wounded The hand of friendship is alone equal to this delicate task
and I have good hope of success I have therefore persuaded him to
travel for some time movement and change of scene will be favorable to
him I shall take him first to Nice we set out tomorrow If he wishes
to prolong this excursion I shall do so too for my affairs do not
imperiously demand my presence in Paris before the end of March As
for the service I have to ask of you it is conditional These are the
facts According to some family papers that belonged to my mother
it seems I have a certain interest to present myself at No 3 Rue
SaintFrancois in Paris on the 13th of February I had inquired about
it and could learn nothing except that this house of very antique
appearance has been shut up for the last hundred and fifty years
through a whim of one of my maternal ancestors and that it is to be
opened on the 13th of this month in presence of the coheirs who if
I have any are quite unknown to me Not being able to attend myself I
have written to my foreman the father of General Simon in whom I have
the greatest confidence and whom I had left behind in the department
of the Creuse to set out for Paris and to be present at the opening
of this house not as an agent which would be useless but as a
spectator and inform me at Nice what has been the result of this
romantic notion of my ancestors As it is possible that my foreman may
arrive too late to accomplish this mission I should be much obliged
if you would inquire at my house at Plessy if he has yet come and
in case of his still being absent if you would take his place at the
opening of the house in the Rue SaintFrancois I believe that I have
made a very small sacrifice for my friend Bressac in not being in Paris
on that day But had the sacrifice been immense I should have made it
with pleasure for my care and friendship are at present most necessary
to the man whom I look upon as a brother I count upon your compliance
with my request and begging you to be kind enough to write me to
be called for at Nice the result of your visit of inquiry I remain
etc etc

FRANCIS HARDY

Though his presence cannot be of any great importance it would be
preferable that Marshal Simons father should not attend at the opening
of this house tomorrow said Father dAigrigny But no matter M
Hardy himself is out of the way There only remains the young Indian

As for him continued the abbe with a thoughtful air we acted
wisely in letting M Norval set out with the presents of Mdlle de
Cardoville The doctor who accompanies M Norval and who was chosen by
M Baleinier will inspire no suspicion

None answered Rodin His letter of yesterday is completely
satisfactory

There is nothing then to fear from the Indian prince said
DAigrigny All goes well

As for Gabriel resumed Rodin he has again written this morning to
obtain from your reverence the interview that he has vainly solicited
for the last three days He is affected by the rigor exercised towards
him in forbidding him to leave the house for these five days past

Tomorrow when we take him to the Rue SaintFrancois I will hear what
he has to say It will be time enough Thus at this hour said Father
dAigrigny with an air of triumphant satisfaction all the descendants
of this family whose presence might ruin our projects are so
placed that it is absolutely impossible for them to be at the Rue
SaintFrancois tomorrow before noon while Gabriel will be sure to be
there At last our end is gained

Two cautious knocks at the door interrupted Father dAigrigny Come
in said he

An old servant in black presented himself and said There is a man
downstairs who wishes to speak instantly to M Rodin on very urgent
business

His name asked Father dAigrigny

He would not tell his name but he says that he comes from M Van Dael
a merchant in Java

Father dAigrigny and Rodin exchanged a glance of surprise almost of
alarm

See what this man is said DAigrigny to Rodin unable to conceal
his uneasiness and then come and give me an account of it Then
addressing the servant he added Show him inand exchanging
another expressive sign with Rodin Father dAigrigny disappeared by a
sidedoor

A minute after Faringhea the exchief of the Stranglers appeared
before Rodin who instantly remembered having seen him at Cardoville
Castle

The socius started but he did not wish to appear to recollect his
visitor Still bending over his desk he seemed not to seen Faringhea
but wrote hastily some words on a sheet of paper that lay before him

Sir said the servant astonished at the silence of Rodin here is
the person

Rodin folded the note that he had so precipitately written and said to
the servant Let this be taken to its address Wait for an answer

The servant bowed and went out Then Rodin without rising fixed his
little reptileeyes on Faringhea and said to him courteously To whom
sir have I the honor of speaking




CHAPTER XVI THE TWO BROTHERS OF THE GOOD WORK

Faringhea as we have before stated though born in India had travelled
a good deal and frequented the European factories in different parts
of Asia Speaking well both English and French and full of intelligence
and sagacity he was perfectly civilized

Instead of answering Rodins question he turned upon him a fixed and
searching look The socius provoked by this silence and forseeing
vaguely that Faringheas arrival had some connectiondirect or
indirectwith Djalma repeated though still with the greatest
coolness To whom sir have I the honor of speaking

Do you not recognize me said Faringhea advancing two steps nearer to
Rodins chair

I do not think I have ever had the honor of seeing you answered the
other coldly

But I recognize you said Faringhea I saw you at Cardoville Castle
the day that a ship and a steamer were wrecked together

At Cardoville Castle It is very possible sir I was there when a
shipwreck took place

And that day I called you by your name and you asked me what I
wanted I replied Nothing now brotherhereafter much The time has
arrived I have come to ask for much

My dear sir said Rodin still impassible before we continue this
conversation which appears hitherto tolerably obscure I must repeat my
wish to be informed to whom I have the advantage of speaking You have
introduced yourself here under pretext of a commission from Mynheer
Joshua Van Dael a respectable merchant of Batavia and

You know the writing of M Van Dael said Faringhea interrupting
Rodin

I know it perfectly

Look The halfcaste drew from his pocket he was shabbily dressed in
European clothes a long dispatch which he had taken from one Mahal the
Smuggler after strangling him on the beach near Batavia These papers
he placed before Rodins eyes but without quitting his hold of them

It is indeed M Van Daels writing said Rodin and he stretched
out his hard towards the letter which Faringhea quickly and prudently
returned to his pocket

Allow me to observe my dear sir that you have a singular manner of
executing a commission said Rodin This letter being to my address
and having been entrusted to you by M Van Dael you ought

This letter was not entrusted to me by M Van Dael said Faringhea
interrupting Rodin

How then is it in your possession

A Javanese smuggler betrayed me Van Dael had secured a passage to
Alexandria for this man and had given him this letter to carry with him
for the European mail I strangled the smuggler took the letter made
the passageand here I am

The Thug had pronounced these words with an air of savage boasting his
wild intrepid glance did not quail before the piercing look of Rodin
who at this strange confession had hastily raised his head to observe
the speaker

Faringhea thought to astonish or intimidate Rodin by these ferocious
words but to his great surprise the socius impassible as a corpse
said to him quite simply Oh they strangle people in Java

Yes there and elsewhere answered Faringhea with a bitter smile

I would prefer to disbelieve you but I am surprised at your sincerity
M what is your name

Faringhea

Well then M Faringhea what do you wish to come to You have
obtained by an abominable crime a letter addressed to me and now you
hesitate to deliver it

Because I have read it and it may be useful to me

Oh you have read it said Rodin disconcerted for a moment Then he
resumed It is true that judging by your mode of possessing yourself
of other peoples correspondence we cannot expect any great amount of
honesty on your part And pray what have you found so useful to you in
this letter

I have found brother that you are like myself a son of the Good
Work

Of what good work do you speak asked Rodin not a little surprised

Faringhea replied with an expression of bitter irony Joshua says to
you in his letterObedience and courage secrecy and patience craft
and audacity union between us who have the world for our country the
brethren for our family Rome for our queen

It is possible that M Van Dael has written thus to me Pray sir what
do you conclude from it

We too have the world for our country brother our accomplices for
our family and for our queen Bowanee

I do not know that saint said Rodin humbly

It is our Rome answered the Strangler Van Dael speaks to you of
those of your Order who scattered over all the earth labor for
the glory of Rome your queen Those of our band labor also in divers
countries for the glory of Bowanee

And who are these sons of Bowanee M Faringhea

Men of resolution audacious patient crafty obstinate who to make
the Good Work succeed would sacrifice country and parents and sister
and brother and who regard as enemies all not of their band

There seems to be much that is good in the persevering and exclusively
religious spirit of such an order said Rodin with a modest and
sanctified air only one must know your ends and objects

The same as your own brotherwe make corpses13

Corpses cried Rodin

In this letter resumed Faringhea Van Dael tells you that the
greatest glory of your Order is to make a corpse of man Our work also
is to make corpses of men Mans death is sweet to Bowanee

But sir cried Rodin M Van Dael speaks of the soul of the will of
the mind which are to be brought down by discipline

It is trueyou kill the soul and we the body Give me your hand
brother for you also are hunters of men

But once more sirunderstand that we only meddle with the will the
mind said Rodin

And what are bodies deprived of soul will thought but mere corpses
Comecome brother the dead we make by the cord are not more icy and
inanimate than those you make by your discipline Take my hand brother
Rome and Bowanee are sisters

Notwithstanding his apparent calmness Rodin could not behold without
some secret alarm a wretch like Faringhea in possession of a long
letter from Van Dael wherein mention must necessarily have been made of
Djalma Rodin believed indeed that he had rendered it impossible for
the young Indian to be at Paris on the morrow but not knowing what
connection might have been formed since the shipwreck between the
prince and the halfcaste he looked upon Faringhea as a man who might
probably be very dangerous But the more uneasy the socius felt in
himself the more he affected to appear calm and disdainful He replied
therefore This comparison between Rome and Bowanee is no doubt very
amusing but what sir do you deduce from it

I wish to show you brother what I am and of what I am capable to
convince you that it is better to have me for a friend than an enemy

In other terms sir said Rodin with contemptuous irony you belong
to a murderous sect in India and you wish by a transparent allegory
to lead me to reflect on the fate of the man from whom you have stolen
the letter addressed to me In my turn I will take the freedom just
to observe to you in all humility M Faringhea that here it is not
permitted to strangle anybody and that if you were to think fit to make
any corpses for the love of Bowanee your goddess we should make you a
head shorter for the love of another divinity commonly called justice

And what would they do to me if I tried to poison any one

I will again humbly observe to you M Faringhea that I have no time
to give you a course of criminal jurisprudence but believe me you
had better resist the temptation to strangle or poison any one One word
more will you deliver up to me the letters of M Van Dael or not

The letters relative to Prince Djalma said the halfcaste looking
fixedly at Rodin who notwithstanding a sharp and sudden twinge
remained impenetrable and answered with the utmost simplicity Not
knowing what the letters which you sir are pleased to keep from me
may contain it is impossible for me to answer your question I beg and
if necessary I demand that you will hand me those lettersor that you
will retire

In a few minutes brother you will entreat me to remain

I doubt it

A few words will operatethis miracle If just now I spoke to you
about poisoning brother it was because you sent a doctor to Cardoville
Castle to poison at least for a time Prince Djalma

In spite of himself Rodin started almost imperceptibly as he replied
I do not understand you

It is true that I am a poor foreigner and doubtless speak with an
accent I will try and explain myself better I know by Van Daels
letters the interest you have that Prince Djalma should not be here to
morrow and all that you have done with this view Do you understand me
now

I have no answer for you

Two cautious taps at the door here interrupted the conversation Come
in said Rodin

The letter has been taken to its address sir said the old servant
bowing and here is the answer

Rodin took the paper and before he opened it said courteously to
Faringhea With your permission sir

Make no ceremonies said the halfcaste

You are very kind replied Rodin as having read the letter he
received he wrote hastily some words at the bottom saying Send this
back to the same address

The servant bowed respectfully and withdrew

Now can I continue asked the halfcaste of Rodin

Certainly

I will continue then resumed Faringhea

The day before yesterday just as the prince all wounded as he
was was about by my advice to take his departure for Paris a fine
carriage arrived with superb presents for Djalma from an unknown
friend In this carriage were two menone sent by the unknown
friendthe other a doctor sent by you to attend upon Djalma and
accompany him to Paris It was a charitable act brotherwas it not
so

Go on with your story sir

Djalma set out yesterday By declaring that the princes wound would
grow seriously worse if he did not lie down in the carriage during all
the journey the doctor got rid of the envoy of the unknown friend who
went away by himself The doctor wished to get rid of me too but Djalma
so strongly insisted upon it that I accompanied the prince and doctor
Yesterday evening we had come about half the distance The doctor
proposed we should pass the night at an inn We have plenty of time
said he to reach Paris by tomorrow eveningthe prince having told
him that he must absolutely be in Paris by the evening of the 12th The
doctor had been very pressing to set out alone with the prince I knew
by Van Daels letter that it was of great importance to you for Djalma
not to be here on the 13th I had my suspicions and I asked the
doctor if he knew you he answered with an embarrassed air and then my
suspicion became certainty When we reached the inn whilst the doctor
was occupied with Djalma I went up to the room of the former and
examined a box full of phials that he had brought with him One of them
contained opiumand then I guessed

What did you guess sir

You shall know The doctor said to Djalma before he left him Your
wound is doing well but the fatigue of the journey might bring on
inflammation it will be good for you in the course of tomorrow to
take a soothing potion that I will make ready this evening to have
with us in the carriage The doctors plan was a simple one added
Faringhea today the prince was to take the potion at four or five
oclock in the afternoonand fall into a deep sleepthe doctor to grow
uneasy and stop the carriageto declare that it would be dangerous to
continue the journeyto pass the night at an inn and keep close watch
over the prince whose stupor was only to cease when it suited your
purposes That was your designit was cleverly plannedI chose to make
use of it myself and I have succeeded

All that you are talking about my dear sir said Rodin biting his
nails is pure Hebrew to me

No doubt because of my accent But tell me have you heard speak of
arraymow

No

Your loss It is an admirable production of the Island of Java so
fertile in poisons

What is that to me said Rodin in a sharp voice but hardly able to
dissemble his growing anxiety

It concerns you nearly We sons of Bowanee have a horror of shedding
blood resumed Faringhea to pass the cord round the neck of our
victims we wait till they are asleep When their sleep is not deep
enough we know how to make it deeper We are skillful at our work the
serpent is not more cunning or the lion more valiant Djalma himself
bears our mark The arraymow is an impalpable powder and by letting
the sleeper inhale a few grains of it or by mixing it with the tobacco
to be smoked by a waking man we can throw our victim into a stupor
from which nothing will rouse him If we fear to administer too strong a
dose at once we let the sleeper inhale a little at different times and
we can thus prolong the trance at pleasure and without any danger
as long as a man does not require meat and drinksay thirty or
forty hours You see that opium is mere trash compared to this divine
narcotic I had brought some of this with me from Javaas a mere
curiosity you knowwithout forgetting the counter poison

Oh there is a counterpoison then said Rodin mechanically

Just as there are people quite contrary to what we are brother of
the good work The Javanese call the juice of this root tooboe it
dissipates the stupor caused by the arraymow as the sun disperses the
clouds Now yesterday evening being certain of the projects of your
emissary against Djalma I waited till the doctor was in bed and
asleep I crept into his room and made him inhale such a dose of
arraymowthat he is probably sleeping still

Miscreant cried Rodin more and more alarmed by this narrative for
Faringhea had dealt a terrible blow at the machinations of the socius
and his friends You risk poisoning the doctor

Yes brother just as he ran the risk of poisoning Djalma This morning
we set out leaving your doctor at the inn plunged in a deep sleep
I was alone in the carriage with Djalma He smoked like a true Indian
some grains of arraymow mixed with the tobacco in his long pipe first
made him drowsy a second dose that he inhaled sent him to sleep and
so I left him at the inn where we stopped Now brother it depends
upon me to leave Djalma in his trance which will last till tomorrow
evening or to rouse him from it on the instant Exactly as you
comply with my demands or not Djalma will or will not be in the Rue
SaintFrancois to morrow

So saying Faringhea drew from his pocket the medal belonging to Djalma
and observed as he showed it to Rodin You see that I tell you
the truth During Djalmas sleep took from him this medal the only
indication he has of the place where he ought to be tomorrow I finish
then as I began Brother I have come to ask you for a great deal

For some minutes Rodin had been biting his nails to the quick as was
his custom when seized with a fit of dumb and concentrated rage Just
then the bell of the porters lodge rang three times in a particular
manner Rodin did not appear to notice it and yet a sudden light
sparkled in his small reptile eyes while Faringhea with his arms
folded looked at him with an expression of triumph and disdainful
superiority The socius bent down his head remained silent for some
seconds took mechanically a pen from his desk and began to gnaw the
feather as if in deep reflection upon what Faringhea had just said
Then throwing down the pen upon the desk he turned suddenly towards
the halfcaste and addressed him with an air of profound contempt Now
really M Faringheado you think to make game of us with your cockand
bull stories

Amazed in spite of his audacity the halfcaste recoiled a step

What sir resumed Rodin You come here into a respectable house
to boast that you have stolen letters strangled this man drugged that
otherWhy sir it is downright madness I wished to hear you to the
end to see to what extent you would carry your audacityfor none but a
monstrous rascal would venture to plume himself on such infamous crimes
But I prefer believing that they exist only in your imagination

As he barked out these words with a degree of animation not usual
in him Rodin rose from his seat and approached the chimney while
Faringhea who had not yet recovered from his surprise looked at him
in silence In a few seconds however the halfcaste returned with a
gloomy and savage mien Take care brother do not force me to prove to
you that I have told the truth

Come come sir you must be fresh from the Antipodes to believe us
Frenchmen such easy dupes You have you say the prudence of a serpent
and the courage of a lion I do not know if you are a courageous lion
but you are certainly not a prudent serpent What you have about you a
letter from M Van Dael by which I might be compromisedsupposing all
this not to be a fableyou have left Prince Djalma in a stupor which
would serve my projects and from which you alone can rouse himyou are
able you say to strike a terrible blow at my interestsand yet you do
not consider bold lion crafty serpent as you are that I only want to
gain twentyfour hours upon you Now you come from the end of India to
Paris an unknown strangeryou believe me to be as great a scoundrel as
yourselfsince you call me brotherand do not once consider that you
are here in my powerthat this street and house are solitary and
that I could have three or four persons to bind you in a second savage
Strangler though you areand that just by pulling this bellrope
said Rodin as he took it in his hand Do not be alarmed added he
with a diabolical smile as he saw Faringhea make an abrupt movement of
surprise and fright would I give you notice if I meant to act in
this mannerBut just answer me Once bound and put in confinement for
twentyfour hours how could you injure me Would it not be easy for
me to possess myself of Van Daels letter and Djalmas medal and the
latter plunged in a stupor till tomorrow evening need not trouble me
at all You see therefore that your threats are vain because they rest
upon falsehoodbecause it is not true that Prince Djalma is here and
in your power Begone sirleave the house and when next you wish to
make dupes show more judgment in the selection

Faringhea seemed struck with astonishment All that he had just heard
seemed very probable Rodin might seize upon him the letter and the
medal and by keeping him prisoner prevent Djalma from being awakened
And yet Rodin ordered him to leave the house at the moment when
Faringhea had imagined himself so formidable As he thought for
the motives of this inexplicable conduct it struck him that Rodin
notwithstanding the proofs he had brought him did not yet believe that
Djalma was in his power On that theory the contempt of Van Daels
correspondent admitted of a natural explanation But Rodin was playing a
bold and skillful game and while he appeared to mutter to himself
as in anger he was observing with intense anxiety the Stranglers
countenance

The latter almost certain that he had divined the secret motive of
Rodin replied I am goingbut one word more You think I deceive
you

I am certain of it You have told me nothing but a tissue of fables
and I have lost much time in listening to them Spare me the rest it is
lateand I should like to be alone

One minute more you are a man I see from whom nothing should be
hid said Faringhea from Djalma I could now only expect alms and
disdainfor with a character like this to say to him Pay me
because I might have betrayed you and did not would be to provoke his
anger and contempt I could have killed him twenty times over but his
day is not yet come said the Thug with a gloomy air and to wait for
that and other fatal days I must have gold much gold You alone can
pay me for the betrayal of Djalma for you alone profit by it You
refuse to hear me because you think I am deceiving you But I took the
direction of the inn where we stoppedand here it is Send some one to
ascertain the truth of what I tell you and then you will believe me
But the price of my services will be high for I told you that I wanted
much

So saying Faringhea offered a printed card to Rodin the socius who
out of the corner of his eye followed all the halfcastes movements
appeared to be absorbed in thought and taking no heed of anything

Here is the address repeated Faringhea as he held out the card to
Rodin assure yourself that I do not lie

Eh what is it said the other casting a rapid but stolen glance at
the address which he read greedily without touching the card

Take this address repeated the halfcaste and you may then assure
yourself

Really sir cried Rodin pushing back the card with his hand your
impudence confounds me I repeat that I wish to have nothing in common
with you For the last time I tell you to leave the house I know
nothing about your Prince Djalma You say you can injure medo somake
no ceremoniesbut in heavens name leave me to myself

So saying Rodin rang the bell violently Faringhea made a movement as
if to stand upon the defensive but only the old servant with his quiet
and placid mien appeared at the door

Lapierre light the gentleman out said Rodin pointing to Faringhea

Terrified at Rodins calmness the halfcaste hesitated to leave the
room

Why do you wait sir said Rodin remarking his hesitation I wish to
be alone

So sir said Faringhea as he withdrew slowly you refuse my
offers Take care tomorrow it will be too late

I have the honor to be your most humble servant sir said Rodin
bowing courteously The Strangler went out and the door closed upon
him

Immediately Father dAigrigny entered from the next room His
countenance was pale and agitated

What have you done exclaimed he addressing Rodin

I have heard all I am unfortunately too sure that this wretch spoke
the truth The Indian is in his power and he goes to rejoin him

I think not said Rodin humbly as bowing he reassumed his dull and
submissive countenance

What will prevent this man from rejoining the prince

Allow me As soon as the rascal was shown in I knew him and so
before speaking a word to him I wrote a few lines to Morok who was
waiting below with Goliath till your reverence should be at leisure
Afterwards in the course of the conversation when they brought me
Moroks answer I added some fresh instructions seeing the turn that
affairs were taking

And what was the use of all this since you have let the man leave the
house

Your reverence will perhaps deign to observe that he did not leave it
till he had given me the direction of the hotel where the Indian now is
thanks to my innocent stratagem of appearing to despise him But if it
had failed Faringhea would still have fallen into the hands of Goliath
and Morok who are waiting for him in the street a few steps from the
door Only we should have been rather embarrassed as we should not have
known where to find Prince Djalma

More violence said Father dAigrigny with repugnance

It is to be regretted very much regretted replied Rodin but it was
necessary to follow out the system already adopted

Is that meant for a reproach said Father dAigrigny who began to
think that Rodin was something more than a mere writingmachine

I could not permit myself to blame your reverence said Rodin
cringing almost to the ground But all that will be required is to
confine this man for twentyfour hours

And afterwardshis complaints

Such a scoundrel as he is will not dare to complain Besides he left
this house in freedom Morok and Goliath will bandage his eyes when they
seize him The house has another entrance in the Rue VieilledesUrsins
At this hour and in such a storm no one will be passing through this
deserted quarter of the town The knave will be confused by the change
of place they will put him into a cellar of the new building and to
morrow night about the same hour they will restore him to liberty with
the like precautions As for the East Indian we now know where to find
him we must send to him a confidential person and if he recovers from
his trance there would be in my humble opinion said Rodin modestly
a very simple and quiet manner of keeping him away from the Rue Saint
Francois all day tomorrow

The same servant with the mild countenance who had introduced and shown
out Faringhea here entered the room after knocking discreetly at the
door He held in his hand a sort of gamebag which he gave to Rodin
saying Here is what M Morok has just brought he came in by the Rue
Vieille

The servant withdrew and Rodin opening the bag said to Father
dAigrigny as he showed him the contents The medal and Van Daels
letter Morok has been quick at his work

One more danger avoided said the marquis it is a pity to be forced
to such measures

We must only blame the rascal who has obliged us to have recourse to
them I will send instantly to the hotel where the Indian lodges

And at seven in the morning you will conduct Gabriel to the Rue Saint
Francois It is there that I must have with him the interview which he
has so earnestly demanded these three days

I informed him of it this evening and he awaits your orders

At last then said Father dAigrigny after so many struggles and
fears and crosses only a few hours separate us from the moment which
we have so long desired

We now conduct the reader to the house in the Rue SaintFrancois

CHAPTER XVII THE HOUSE IN THE RUE SAINTFRANCOIS

On entering the Rue SaintGervais by the Rue Dore in the Marais
you would have found yourself at the epoch of this narrative directly
opposite to an enormously high wall the stones of which were black and
wormeaten with age This wall which extended nearly the whole length
of that solitary street served to support a terrace shaded by trees
of some hundred years old which thus grew about forty feet above the
causeway Through their thick branches appeared the stone front peaked
roof and tall brick chimneys of an antique house the entrance of which
was situated in the Rue SaintFrancois not far from the Rue Saint
Gervais corner Nothing could be more gloomy than the exterior of this
abode On the entranceside also was a very high wall pierced with two
or three loopholes strongly grated A carriage gateway in massive oak
barred with iron and studded with large nailheads whose primitive
color disappeared beneath a thick layer of mud dust and rust fitted
close into the arch of a deep recess forming the swell of a bay window
above In one of these massive gates was a smaller door which served
for ingress and egress to Samuel the Jew the guardian of this dreary
abode On passing the threshold you came to a passage formed in the
building which faced in the street In this building was the lodging of
Samuel with its windows opening upon the rather spacious inner court
yard through the railing of which you perceived the garden In the
middle of this garden stood a twostoried stone house so strangely
built that you had to mount a flight of steps or rather a
doubleflight of at least twenty steps to reach the door which had
been walled up a hundred and fifty years before The windowblinds
of this habitation had been replaced by large thick plates of lead
hermetically soldered and kept in by frames of iron clamped in the
stone Moreover completely to intercept air and light and thus to
guard against decay within and without the roof had been covered with
thick sheets of lead as well as the vents of the tall chimneys which
had previously been bricked up The same precautions had been taken with
respect to a small square belvedere situated on the top of the house
this glass cage was covered with a sort of dome soldered to the roof
Only in consequence of some singular fancy in every one of the leaden
plates which concealed the four sides of the belvedere corresponding
to the cardinal points seven little round holes had been bored in
the form of a cross and were easily distinguishable from the outside
Everywhere else the plates of lead were completely unpierced Thanks
to these precautions and to the substantial structure of the
building nothing but a few outward repairs had been necessary and the
apartments entirely removed from the influence of the external air no
doubt remained during a century and a half exactly in the same state
as at the time of their being shut up The aspect of walls in crevices
of broken wormeaten shutters of a roof half fallen in and windows
covered with wallflowers would perhaps have been less sad than the
appearance of this stone house plated with iron and lead and preserved
like a mausoleum The garden completely deserted and only regularly
visited once a week by Samuel presented to the view particularly in
summer an incredible confusion of parasites and brambles The trees
left to themselves had shot forth and mingled their branches in all
directions some straggling vines reproduced from offshoots had
crept along the ground to the foot of the trees and climbing up their
trunks had twined themselves about them and encircled their highest
branches with their inextricable net You could only pass through this
virgin forest by following the path made by the guardian to go from the
grating to the house the approaches to which were a little sloped to
let the water run off and carefully paved to the width of about ten
feet Another narrow path which extended all around the enclosure was
every night perambulated by two or three Pyrenees dogsa faithful race
which had been perpetuated in the house during a century and a half
Such was the habitation destined for the meeting of the descendants of
the family of Rennepont The night which separated the 12th from the
13th day of February was near its close A calm had succeeded the storm
and the rain had ceased the sky was clear and full of stars the moon
on its decline shone with a mild lustre and threw a melancholy light
over that deserted silent house whose threshold for so many years no
human footstep had crossed

A bright gleam of light issuing from one of the windows of the
guardians dwelling announced that Samuel was awake Figure to yourself
a tolerably large room lined from top to bottom with old walnut
wainscoting browned to an almost black with age Two halfextinguished
brands are smoking amid the cinders on the hearth On the stone
mantelpiece painted to resemble gray granite stands an old iron
candlestick furnished with a meagre candle capped by an extinguisher
Near it one sees a pair of doublebarrelled pistols and a sharp
cutlass with a hilt of carved bronze belonging to the seventeenth
century Moreover a heavy rifle rests against one of the chimney jambs
Four stools an old oak press and a square table with twisted legs
formed the sole furniture of this apartment Against the wall were
systematically suspended a number of keys of different sizes the shape
of which bore evidence to their antiquity whilst to their rings were
affixed divers labels The back of the old press which moved by a
secret spring had been pushed aside and discovered built in the wall
a large and deep iron chest the lid of which being open displayed
the wondrous mechanism of one of those Florentine locks of the sixteenth
century which better than any modern invention set all picklocks
at defiance and moreover according to the notions of that age are
supplied with a thick lining of asbestos cloth suspended by gold wire
at a distance from the sides of the chest for the purpose of rendering
incombustible the articles contained in it A large cedarwood box
had been taken from the chest and placed upon a stool it contained
numerous papers carefully arranged and docketed By the light of a
brass lamp the old keeper Samuel was writing in a small register
whilst Bathsheba his wife was dictating to him from an account Samuel
was about eighty two years old and notwithstanding his advanced age a
mass of gray curling hair covered his head He was short thin nervous
and the involuntary petulance of his movements proved that years had not
weakened his energy and activity though out of doors where however
he made his appearance very seldom he affected a sort of second
childhood as had been remarked by Rodin to Father dAigrigny An old
dressinggown of marooncolored camlet with large sleeves completely
enveloped the old man and reached to his feet

Samuels features were cast in the pure Eastern mould of his race His
complexion was of a dead yellow his nose aquiline his chin shaded by
a little tuft of white beard while projecting cheekbones threw a harsh
shadow upon the hollow and wrinkled cheeks His countenance was full of
intelligence fine sharpness and sagacity On his broad high forehead
one might read frankness honesty and firmness his eyes black and
brilliant as an Arabs were at once mild and piercing

His wife Bathsheba some fifteen years younger than himself was of
tall stature and dressed entirely in black A low cap of starched
lawn which reminded one of the grave headdresses of Dutch matrons
encircled a pale and austere countenance formerly of a rare and haughty
beauty and impressed with the Scriptural character Some lines in the
forehead caused by the almost continual knitting of her gray brows
showed that this woman had often suffered from the pressure of intense
grief

At this very moment her countenance betrayed inexpressible sorrow Her
look was fixed her head resting on her bosom She had let her right
hand which held a small accountbook fall upon her lap while the
other hand grasped convulsively a long tress of jetblack hair which
she bore about her neck It was fastened by a golden clasp about an
inch square in which under a plate of crystal that shut in one side
of it like a reliccase could be seen a piece of linen folded square
and almost entirely covered with dark red spots that resembled blood a
long time dried

After a short silence during which Samuel was occupied with his
register he read aloud what he had just been writing Per contra
5000 Austrian Metallics of 1000 florins under date of October 19th
1826

After which enumeration Samuel raised his head and said to his wife
Well is it right Bathsheba Have you compared it with the account
book

Bathsheba did not answer Samuel looked at her and seeing that she was
absorbed in grief said to her with an expression of tender anxiety
What is the matter Good heaven what is the matter with you

The 19th of October 1826 said she slowly with her eyes still
fixed and pressing yet more closely the lock of black hair which she
wore about her neck It was a fatal dayfor Samuel it was the date
of the last letter which we received from

Bathsheba was unable to proceed She uttered a long sigh and concealed
her face in her hands

Oh I understand you observed the old man in a tremulous voice a
father may be taken up by the thought of other cares but the heart of
a mother is ever wakeful Throwing his pen down upon the table Samuel
leaned his forehead upon his hands in sorrow

Bathsheba resumed as if she found a melancholy pleasure in these cruel
remembrances Yes that was the last day on which our son Abel wrote
to us from Germany to announce to us that he had invested the funds
according to your desire and was going thence into Poland to effect
another operation

And in Poland he met the death of a martyr added Samuel With no
motive and no proof they accused him falsely of coming to organize
smuggling and the Russian governor treating him as they treat our
brothers in that land of cruel tyranny condemned him to the dreadful
punishment of the knout without even hearing him in his defence Why
should they hear a Jew What is a Jew A creature below a serf whom
they reproach for all the vices that a degrading slavery has engendered
A Jew beaten to death Who would trouble themselves about it

And poor Abel so good so faithful died beneath their stripes partly
from shame partly from the wounds said Bathsheba shuddering One
of our Polish brethren obtained with great difficulty permission to
bury him He cut off this lock of beautiful black hairwhich with this
scrap of linen bathed in the blood of our dear son is all that
now remains to us of him Bathsheba covered the hair and clasp with
convulsive kisses

Alas said Samuel drying his tears which had burst forth at these
sad recollections the Lord did not at last remove our child until the
task which our family has accomplished faithfully for a century and a
half was nearly at an end Of what use will our race be henceforth upon
earth added Samuel most bitterly Our duty is performed This casket
contains a royal fortuneand yonder house walled up for a hundred
and fifty years will be opened tomorrow to the descendants of my
ancestors benefactor So saying Samuel turned his face sorrowfully
towards the house which he could see through the window The dawn was
just about to appear The moon had set belvedere roof and chimneys
formed a black mass upon the dark blue of the starry firmament

Suddenly Samuel grew pale and rising abruptly said to his wife in
a tremulous tone whilst he still pointed to the house Bathsheba the
seven points of lightjust as it was thirty years ago Look look

Indeed the seven round holes bored in the form of a cross in the
leaden plates which covered the window of the belvedere sparkled like
so many luminous points as if some one in the house ascended with a
light to the roof




CHAPTER XVIII DEBIT AND CREDIT

For some seconds Samuel and Bathsheba remained motionless with their
eyes fixed in fear and uneasiness on the seven luminous points
which shone through the darkness of the night from the summit of the
belvedere while on the horizon behind the house a pale rosy hue
announced the dawn of day

Samuel was the first to break silence and he said to his wife as he
drew his hand across his brow The grief caused by the remembrance of
our poor child has prevented us from reflecting that after all there
should be nothing to alarm us in what we see

How so Samuel

My father always told me that he and my grandfather before him had
seen such lights at long intervals

Yes Samuelbut without being able any more than ourselves to
explain the cause

Like my father and grandfather we can only suppose that some secret
passage gives admittance to persons who like us have some mysterious
duty to fulfil in this dwelling Besides my father warned me not to be
uneasy at these appearances foretold by him and now visible for the
second time in thirty years

No matter for that Samuel it does strike one as if it was something
supernatural

The days of miracles are over said the Jew shaking his head
sorrowfully many of the old houses in this quarter have subterraneous
communications with distant placessome extending even to the Seine and
the Catacombs Doubtless this house is so situated and the persons who
make these rare visits enter by some such means

But that the belvedere should be thus lighted up

According to the plan of the building you know that the belvedere
forms a kind of skylight to the apartment called the Great Hall of
Mourning situated on the upper story As it is completely dark in
consequence of the closing of all the windows they must use a light to
visit this Hall of Mourninga room which is said to contain some very
strange and gloomy things added the Jew with a shudder

Bathsheba as well as her husband gazed attentively on the seven
luminous points which diminished in brightness as the daylight
gradually increased

As you say Samuel the mystery may be thus explained resumed the
Hebrews wife Besides the day is so important a one for the family
of Rennepont that this apparition ought not to astonish us under the
circumstances

Only to think remarked Samuel that these lights have appeared at
several different times throughout a century and a half There must
therefore be another family that like ours has devoted itself from
generation to generation to accomplish a pious duty

But what is this duty It will perhaps be explained today

Come come Bathsheba suddenly exclaimed Samuel as if roused from
his reverie and reproaching himself with idleness this is the day
and before eight oclock our cash account must be in order and these
titles to immense property arranged so that they may be delivered to
the rightful ownersand he pointed to the cedarwood box

You are right Samuel this day does not belong to us It is a solemn
dayone that would have been sweet oh very sweet to you and meif
now any days could be sweet to us said Bathsheba bitterly for she was
thinking of her son

Bathsheba said Samuel mournfully as he laid his hand on his wifes
we shall at least have the stern satisfaction of having done our duty
And has not the Lord been very favorable to us though He has thus
severely tried us by the death of our son Is it not thanks to His
providence that three generations of my family have been able to
commence continue and finish this great work

Yes Samuel said the Jewess affectionately and for you at least
this satisfaction will be combined with calm and quietness for on
the stroke of noon you will be delivered from a very terrible
responsibility

So saying Bathsheba pointed to the box

It is true replied the old man I had rather these immense riches
were in the hands of those to whom they belong than in mine but to
day I shall cease to be their trustee Once more then I will check the
account for the last time and compare the register with the cashbook
that you hold in your hand

Bathsheba bowed her head affirmatively and Samuel taking up his pen
occupied himself once more with his calculations His wife in spite
of herself again yielded to the sad thoughts which that fatal date had
awakened by reminding her of the death of her son

Let us now trace rapidly the history in appearance so romantic and
marvellous in reality so simple of the fifty thousand crowns which
thanks to the law of accumulation and to a prudent intelligent and
faithful investment had naturally and necessarily been transformed
in the space of a century and a half into a sum far more important
than the forty millions estimated by Father dAigrignywho partially
informed on this subject and reckoning the disastrous accidents
losses and bankruptcies which might have occurred during so long a
period believed that forty millions might well b e considered enormous

The history of this fortune being closely connected with that of the
Samuel family by whom it had been managed for three generations we
shall give it again in a few words

About the period 1670 some years before his death Marius de Rennepont
then travelling in Portugal had been enabled by means of powerful
interest to save the life of an unfortunate Jew condemned to be burnt
alive by the Inquisition because of his religion This Jew was Isaac
Samuel grandfather of the present guardian of the house in the Rue
SaintFrancois

Generous men often attach themselves to those they have served as much
at least as the obliged parties are attached to their benefactors
Having ascertained that Isaac who at that time carried on a petty
brokers business at Lisbon was industrious honest active laborious
and intelligent M de Rennepont who then possessed large property
in France proposed to the Jew to accompany him and undertake the
management of his affairs The same hatred and suspicion with which the
Israelites have always been followed was then at its height Isaac was
therefore doubly grateful for this mark of confidence on the part of
M de Rennepont He accepted the offer and promised from that day to
devote his existence to the service of him who had first saved his life
and then trusted implicitly to his good faith and uprightness although
he was a Jew and belonged to a race generally suspected and despised
M de Rennepont a man of great soul endowed with a good spirit was
not deceived in his choice Until he was deprived of his fortune it
prospered wonderfully in the hands of Isaac Samuel who gifted with an
admirable aptitude for business applied himself exclusively to advance
the interests of his benefactor

Then came the persecution and ruin of M de Rennepont whose property
was confiscated and given up to the reverend fathers of the Company of
Jesus only a few days before his death Concealed in the retreat he had
chosen therein to put a violent end to his life he sent secretly for
Isaac Samuel and delivered to him fifty thousand crowns in gold the
last remains of his fortune This faithful servant was to invest the
money to the best advantage and if he should have a son transmit to
him the same obligation or should he have no child he was to seek out
some relation worthy of continuing this trust to which would moreover
be annexed a fair reward It was thus to be transmitted and perpetuated
from relative to relative until the expiration of a century and a half
M de Rennepont also begged Isaac to take charge during his life of
the house in the Rue SaintFrancois where he would be lodged gratis
and to leave this function likewise to his descendants if it were
possible

If even Isaac Samuel had not had children the powerful bond of union
which exists between certain Jewish families would have rendered
practicable the last will of De Rennepont The relations of Isaac would
have become partner in his gratitude to his benefactor and they and
their succeeding generations would have religiously accomplished the
task imposed upon one of their race But several years after the death
of De Rennepont Isaac had a son

This son Levy Samuel born in 1689 not having had any children by his
first wife married again at nearly sixty years of age and in 1750 he
also had a sonDavid Samuel the guardian of the house in the Rue Saint
Francois who in 1832 the date of this narrative was eightytwo
years old and seemed likely to live as long as his father who had died
at the age of ninetythree Finally Abel Samuel the son whom Bathsheba
so bitterly regretted born in 1790 had perished under the Russian
knout at the age of thirtysix

Having established this humble genealogy we easily understand how this
successive longevity of three members of the Samuel family all of whom
had been guardians of the walled house by uniting as it were the
nineteenth with the seventeenth century simplified and facilitated
the execution of M de Renneponts will the latter having declared his
desire to the grandfather of the Samuels that the capital should only
be augmented by interest at five per centso that the fortune might
come to his descendants free from all taint of usurious speculation

The fellow men of the Samuel family the first inventors of the bill of
exchange which served them in the Middle Ages to transport mysteriously
considerable amounts from one end of the world to the other to conceal
their fortune and to shield it from the rapacity of their enemiesthe
Jews we say having almost the monopoly of the trade in money and
exchanges until the end of the eighteenth century aided the secret
transactions and financial operations of this family which up to about
1820 placed their different securities which had become progressively
immense in the hands of the principal Israelitish bankers and merchants
of Europe This sure and secret manner of acting had enabled the present
guardian of the house in the Rue SaintFrancois to effect enormous
investments unknown to all and it was more especially during the
period of his management that the capital sum had acquired by the mere
fact of compound interest an almost incalculable development Compared
with him his father and grandfather had only small amounts to manage
Though it had only been necessary to find successively sure and
immediate investments so that the money might not remain as it were
one day without bearing interest it had acquired financial capacity to
attain this result when so many millions were in question The last of
the Samuels brought up in the school of his father had exhibited
this capacity in a very high degree as will be seen immediately by the
results Nothing could be more touching noble and respectable than
the conduct of the members of this Jewish family who partners in the
engagement of gratitude taken by their ancestor devote themselves for
long years with as much disinterestedness as intelligence and honesty
to the slow acquisition of a kingly fortune of which they expect no
part themselves but which thanks to them would come pure as immense
to the hands of the descendants of their benefactor Nor could anything
be more honorable to him who made and him who received this deposit
than the simple promise by word of mouth unaccompanied by any security
save mutual confidence and reciprocal esteem when the result was only
to be produced at the end of a century and a half

After once more reading his inventory with attention Samuel said to his
wife I am certain of the correctness of my additions Now please
to compare with the accountbook in your hand the summary of the
investments that I have just entered in the register I will assure
myself at the same time that the bonds and vouchers are properly
arranged in this casket that on the opening of the will they may be
delivered in order to the notary

Begin my dear and I will check you said Bathsheba

Samuel read as follows examining as he went on the contents of his
casket

It is quite right said Samuel after examining the papers contained
in the cedarwood box There remains in hand at the absolute disposal
of the heirs of the Rennepont family the Sum Of TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE
MILLIONS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE THOUSAND FRANCS And the old man
looked at his wife with an expression of legitimate pride It is hardly
credible cried Bathsheba struck with surprise I knew that you had
immense property in your hands but I could never have believed that
one hundred and fifty thousand francs left a century and a half ago
should be the only source of this immense fortune

It is even so Bathsheba answered the old man proudly Doubtless
my grandfather my father and myself have all been exact and faithful
in the management of these funds doubtless we have required some
sagacity in the choice of investments in times of revolution and
commercial panics but all this was easy to us thanks to our relations
with our brethren in all countriesand never have I or any of mine
made an usurious investment or even taken the full advantage of
the legal rate of interest Such were the positive demands of M de
Rennepont given to my grandfather nor is there in the world a
fortune that has been obtained by purer means Had it not been for this
disinterestedness we might have much augmented this two hundred
and twelve millions only by taking advantage of a few favorable
circumstances

Dear me is it possible

Nothing is more simple Bathsheba Every one knows that in fourteen
years a capital will be doubled by the mere accumulation of interest
and compound interest at five per cent Now reflect that in a century
and a half there are ten times fourteen years and that these one
hundred and fifty thousands francs have thus been doubled and redoubled
over and over again All that astonishes you will then appear plain
enough In 1682 M de Rennepont entrusted my grandfather with a hundred
and fifty thousand francs this sum invested as I have told you would
have produced in 1696 fourteen years after three hundred thousand
francs These last doubled in 1710 would produce six hundred thousand
On the death of my grandfather in 1719 the amount was already near a
million in 1724 it would be twelve hundred thousand francs in 1738
two millions four hundred thousand in 1752 about two years after my
birth four millions eight hundred thousand in 1766 nine millions six
hundred thousand in 1780 nineteen millions two hundred thousand in
1794 twelve years after the death of my father thirtyeight millions
four hundred thousand in 1808 seventysix millions eight hundred
thousand in 1822 one hundred and fiftythree millions six hundred
thousand and at this time taking the compound interest for ten years
it should be at least two hundred and twentyfive millions But losses
and inevitable charges of which the account has been strictly kept
have reduced the sum to two hundred and twelve millions one hundred and
seventyfive thousand francs the securities for which are in this box

I now understand you my dear answered Bathsheba thoughtfully
but how wonderful is this power of accumulation and what admirable
provision may be made for the future with the smallest present
resources

Such no doubt was the idea of M de Rennepont for my father has
often told me and he derived it from his father that M de Rennepont
was one of the soundest intellects of his time said Samuel as he
closed the cedarbox

God grant his descendants may be worthy of this kingly fortune and
make a noble use of it said Bathsheba rising

It was now broad day and the clock had just struck seven

The masons will soon be here said Samuel as he replaced the
cedarbox in the iron safe concealed behind the antique press Like
you Bathsheba I am curious and anxious to know what descendants of M
de Rennepont will now present themselves

Two or three loud knocks on the outer gate resounded through the house
The barking of the watchdogs responded to this summons

Samuel said to his wife It is no doubt the masons whom the notary has
sent with his clerk Tie all the keys and their labels together I will
come back and fetch them

So saying Samuel went down to the door with much nimbleness
considering his age prudently opened a small wicket and saw three
workmen in the garb of masons accompanied by a young man dressed in
black

What may you want gentlemen said the Jew before opening the door
as he wished first to make sure of the identity of the personages

I am sent by M Dumesnil the notary answered the clerk to be
present at the unwalling of a door Here is a letter from my master
addressed to M Samuel guardian of the house

I am he sir said the Jew please to put the letter through the
slide and I will take it

The clerk did as Samuel desired but shrugged his shoulders at what
he considered the ridiculous precautions of a suspicious old man The
housekeeper opened the box took the letter went to the end of
the vaulted passage in order to read it and carefully compared the
signature with that of another letter which he drew from the pocket
of his long coat then after all these precautions he chained up his
dogs and returned to open the gate to the clerk and masons

What the devil my good man said the clerk as he entered there
would not be more formalities in opening the gates of a fortress

The Jew bowed but without answering

Are you deaf my good fellow cried the clerk close to his ears

No sir said Samuel with a quiet smile as he advanced several steps
beyond the passage Then pointing to the old house he added That
sir is the door which you will have to open you will also have to
remove the lead and iron from the second window to the right

Why not open all the windows asked the clerk

Because sir as guardian of this house I have received particular
orders on the subject

Who gave you these orders

My father sir who received them from his father who transmitted them
from the master of this house When I cease to have the care of it the
new proprietor will do as he pleases

Oh very well said the clerk not a little surprised Then
addressing himself to the masons he added This is your business my
fine fellows you are to unwall the door and remove the iron framework
of the second window to the right

Whilst the masons set to work under the inspection of the notarys
clerk a coach stopped before the outer gate and Rodin accompanied by
Gabriel entered the house in the Rue SaintFrancois




CHAPTER XIX THE HEIR

Samuel opened the door to Gabriel and Rodin

The latter said to the Jew You sir are the keeper of this house

Yes sir replied Samuel

This is Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont said Rodin as he introduced his
companion one of the descendants of the family of the Renneponts

Happy to hear it sir said the Jew almost involuntarily struck with
the angelic countenance of Gabrielfor nobleness and serenity of soul
were visible in the glance of the young priest and were written upon
his pure white brow already crowned with the halo of martyrdom Samuel
looked at Gabriel with curiosity and benevolent interest but feeling
that this silent contemplation must cause some embarrassment to his
guest he said to him M Abbe the notary will not be here before ten
oclock

Gabriel looked at him in turn with an air of surprise and answered
What notary sir

Father dAigrigny will explain all this to you said Rodin hastily
Then addressing Samuel he added We are a little before the time Will
you allow us to wait for the arrival of the notary

Certainly said Samuel if you please to walk into my house

I thank you sir answered Rodin and accept your offer

Follow me then gentlemen said the old man

A few moments after the young priest and the socius preceded by
Samuel entered one of the rooms occupied by the latter on the
groundfloor of the building looking out upon the courtyard

The Abbe dAigrigny who has been the guardian of M Gabriel will soon
be coming to ask for us added Rodin will you have the kindness sir
to show him into this room

I will not fail to do so sir said Samuel as he went out

The socius and Gabriel were left alone To the adorable gentleness which
usually gave to the fine features of the missionary so touching a charm
there had succeeded in this moment a remarkable expression of sadness
resolution and severity Rodin not having seen Gabriel for some days
was greatly struck by the change he remarked in him He had watched him
silently all the way from the Rue des Postes to the Rue SaintFrancois
The young priest wore as usual a long black cassock which made still
more visible the transparent paleness of his countenance When the Jew
had left the room Gabriel said to Rodin in a firm voice Will you at
length inform me sir why for some days past I have been prevented
from speaking to his reverence Father dAigrigny Why has he chosen this
house to grant me an interview

It is impossible for me to answer these questions replied Rodin
coldly His reverence will soon arrive and will listen to you All I
can tell you is that the reverend father lays as much stress upon this
meeting as you do If he has chosen this house for the interview it is
because you have an interest to be here You know it wellthough you
affected astonishment on hearing the guardian speak of a notary

So saying Rodin fixed a scrutinizing anxious look upon Gabriel whose
countenance expressed only surprise

I do not understand you said he in reply to Rodin What have I to
do with this house

It is impossible that you should not know it answered Rodin still
looking at him with attention

I have told you sir that I do not know it replied the other almost
offended by the pertinacity of the socius

What then did your adopted mother come to tell you yesterday Why did
you presume to receive her without permission from Father dAigrigny as
I have heard this morning Did she not speak with you of certain family
papers found upon you when she took you in

No sir said Gabriel those papers were delivered at the time to
my adopted mothers confessor and they afterwards passed into Father
dAigrignys hands This is the first I hear for a long time of these
papers

So you affirm that Frances Baudoin did not come to speak to you on
this subject resumed Rodin obstinately laying great emphasis on his
words

This is the second time sir that you seem to doubt my affirmation
said the young priest mildly while he repressed a movement of
impatience I assure you that I speak the truth

He knows nothing thought Rodin for he was too well convinced of
Gabriels sincerity to retain the least doubt after so positive a
declaration I believe you went on he The idea only occurred to me
in reflecting what could be the reason of sufficient weight to induce
you to transgress Father dAigrignys orders with regard to the absolute
retirement he had commanded which was to exclude all communication with
those without Much more contrary to all the rules of our house you
ventured to shut the door of your room whereas it ought to remain half
open that the mutual inspection enjoined us might be the more easily
practiced I could only explain these sins against discipline by the
necessity of some very important conversation with your adopted mother

It was to a priest and not to her adopted son that Madame Baudoin
wished to speak replied Gabriel in a tone of deep seriousness I
closed my door because I was to hear a confession

And what had Frances Baudoin of such importance to confess

You will know that byandbye when I speak to his reverenceif it be
his pleasure that you should hear me

These words were so firmly spoken that a long silence ensued Let us
remind the reader that Gabriel had hitherto been kept by his superiors
in the most complete ignorance of the importance of the family interests
which required his presence in the Rue SaintFrancois The day before
Frances Baudoin absorbed in her own grief had forgotten to tell him
that the two orphans also should be present at this meeting and had she
even thought of it Dagobert would have prevented her mentioning this
circumstance to the young priest

Gabriel was therefore quite ignorant of the family ties which united him
with the daughters of Marshal Simon with Mdlle de Cardoville with M
Hardy Prince Djalma and Sleepinbuff In a word if it had then been
revealed to him that he was the heir of Marius de Rennepont he would
have believed himself the only descendant of the family During the
moments silence which succeeded his conversation with Rodin Gabriel
observed through the windows the masons at their work of unwalling the
door Having finished this first operation they set about removing the
bars of iron by which a plate of lead was fixed over the same entrance

At this juncture Father dAigrigny conducted by Samuel entered the
room Before Gabriel could turn around Rodin had time to whisper to the
reverend father He knows nothingand we have no longer anything to
fear from the Indian

Notwithstanding his affected calmness Father dAigrignys countenance
was pale and contracted like that of a player who is about to stake all
on a last decisive game Hitherto all had favored the designs of the
Society but he could not think without alarm of the four hours which
still remained before they should reach the fatal moment Gabriel having
turned towards him Father dAigrigny offered him his hand with a smile
and said to him in an affectionate and cordial tone My dear son it
has pained me a good deal to have been obliged to refuse you till now
the interview that you so much desired It has been no less distressing
to me to impose on you a confinement of some days Though I cannot give
any explanation of what I may think fit to order I will just observe to
you that I have acted only for your interest

I am bound to believe your reverence answered Gabriel bowing his
head

In spite of himself the young priest felt a vague sense of fear for
until his departure for his American mission Father dAigrigny
at whose feet he had pronounced the formidable vows which bound him
irrevocably to the Society of Jesus had exercised over him that
frightful species of influence which acting only by despotism
suppression and intimidation breaks down all the living forces of
the soul and leaves it inert trembling and terrified Impressions of
early youth are indelible and this was the first time since his
return from America that Gabriel found himself in presence of Father
dAigrigny and although he did not shrink from the resolution he had
taken he regretted not to have been able as he had hoped to gather
new strength and courage from an interview with Agricola and Dagobert
Father dAigrigny knew mankind too well not to have remarked the emotion
of the young priest and to have endeavored to explain its cause This
emotion appeared to him a favorable omen he redoubled therefore his
seductive arts his air of tenderness and amenity reserving to himself
if necessary the choice of assuming another mask He sat down while
Gabriel and Rodin remained standing in a respectful position and said
to the former You desire my dear son to have an important interview
with me

Yes father said Gabriel involuntarily casting down his eyes before
the large glittering gray pupil of his superior

And I also have matters of great importance to communicate to you
Listen to me first you can speak afterwards

I listen father

It is about twelve years ago my dear son said Father dAigrigny
affectionately that the confessor of your adopted mother addressing
himself to me through M Rodin called my attention to yourself by
reporting the astonishing progress you had made at the school of the
Brothers I soon found indeed that your excellent conduct your
gentle modest character and your precocious intelligence were worthy
of the most tender interest From that moment I kept my eyes upon
you and at the end of some time seeing that you did not fall off it
appeared to me that there was something more in you than the stuff that
makes a workman We agreed with your adopted mother and through my
intervention you were admitted gratuitously to one of the schools of
our Company Thus one burden the less weighed upon the excellent woman
who had taken charge of you and you received from our paternal care all
the benefits of a religious education Is not this true my dear son

It is true father answered Gabriel casting down his eyes

As you grew up excellent and rare virtues displayed themselves in your
character Your obedience and mildness were above all exemplary You
made rapid progress in your studies I knew not then to what career you
wished to devote yourself but I felt certain that in every station of
life you would remain a faithful son of the Church I was not deceived
in my hopes or rather my dear son you surpassed them all Learning
by a friendly communication that your adopted mother ardently desired
to see you take orders you acceded generously and religiously to the
wish of the excellent woman to whom you owed so much But as the Lord is
always just in His recompenses He willed that the most touching work of
gratitude you could show to your adopted mother should at the same time
be divinely profitable by making you one of the militant members of our
holy Church

At these words Gabriel could not repress a significant start as he
remembered Frances sad confidences But he restrained himself whilst
Rodin stood leaning with his elbow on the corner of the chimneypiece
continuing to examine him with singular and obstinate attention

Father dAigrigny resumed I do not conceal from you my dear son
that your resolution filled me with joy I saw in you one of the future
lights of the Church and I was anxious to see it shine in the midst
of our Company You submitted courageously to our painful and difficult
tests you were judged worthy of belonging to us and after taking in
my presence the irrevocable and sacred oath which binds you for ever to
our Company for the greater glory of God you answered the appeal of our
Holy Father14 to willing souls and offered yourself as a missionary
to preach to savages the one Catholic faith Though it was painful to us
to part with our dear son we could not refuse to accede to such
pious wishes You set out a humble missionary you return a glorious
martyrand we are justly proud to reckon you amongst our number This
rapid sketch of the past was necessary my dear son to arrive at what
follows for we wish now if it be possible to draw still closer the
bonds that unite us Listen to me my dear son what I am about to say
is confidential and of the highest importance not only for you but the
whole Company

Then father cried Gabriel hastily interrupting the Abbe dAigrigny
I cannotI ought not to hear you

The young priest became deadly pale one saw by the alteration of
his features that a violent struggle was taking place within him but
recovering his first resolution he raised his head and casting an
assured look on Father dAigrigny and Rodin who glanced at each other
in mute surprise he resumed I repeat to you father that if it
concerns confidential matters of the Company I must not hear you

Really my dear son you occasion me the greatest astonishment What
is the matterYour countenance changes your emotion is visible Speak
without fear why can you not hear me

I cannot tell you father until I also have in my turn rapidly
sketched the pastsuch as I have learned to judge it of late You
will then understand father that I am no longer entitled to your
confidence for an abyss will doubtlessly soon separate us

At these words it is impossible to paint the look rapidly exchanged
between Rodin and Father dAigrigny The socius began to bite his nails
fixing his reptile eye angrily upon Gabriel Father dAigrigny grew
livid and his brow was bathed in cold sweat He asked himself with
terror if at the moment of reaching the goal the obstacle was going
to come from Gabriel in favor of whom all other obstacles had been
removed This thought filled him with despair Yet the reverend
father contained himself admirably remained calm and answered with
affectionate unction It is impossible to believe my dear son that
you and I can ever be separated by an abyssunless by the abyss of
grief which would be caused by any serious danger to your salvation
But speak I listen to you

It is true that twelve years ago father proceeded Gabriel in a
firm voice growing more animated as he proceeded I entered through
your intervention a college of the Company of Jesus I entered it
loving truthful confiding How did they encourage those precious
instincts of childhood I will tell you The day of my entrance the
Superior said to me as he pointed out two children a little older than
myself These are the companions that you will prefer You will always
walk three together The rules of the house forbid all intercourse
between two persons only They also require that you should listen
attentively to what your companions say so that you may report it to
me for these dear children may have without knowing it bad thoughts
or evil projects Now if you love your comrades you must inform me of
these evil tendencies that my paternal remonstrances may save them from
punishment it is better to prevent evil than to punish it

Such are indeed my dear son said Father dAigrigny the rules
of our house and the language we hold to all our pupils on their
entrance

I know it father answered Gabriel bitterly three days after
a poor submissive and credulous child I was already a spy upon my
comrades hearing and remembering their conversation and reporting it
to the superior who congratulated me on my zeal What they thus made
me do was shameful and yet God knows I thought I was accomplishing a
charitable duty I was happy in obeying the commands of a superior whom
I respected and to whose words I listened in my childish faith as I
should have listened to those of Heaven One day that I had broken some
rule of the house the superior said to me My child you have deserved
a severe punishment but you will be pardoned if you succeed in
surprising one of your comrades in the same fault that you have
committed And for that notwithstanding my faith and blind obedience
this encouragement to turn informer from the motive of personal
interest might appear odious to me the superior added I speak to
you my child for the sake of your comrades salvation Were he
to escape punishment his evil habits would become habitual But by
detecting him in a fault and exposing him to salutary correction you
will have the double advantage of aiding in his salvation and escaping
yourself a merited punishment which will have been remitted because of
your zeal for your neighbor

Doubtless answered Father dAigrigny more and more terrified by
Gabriels language and in truth my dear son all this is conformable
to the rule followed in our colleges and to the habits of the members
of our Company who may denounce each other without prejudice to mutual
love and charity and only for their greater spiritual advancement
particularly when questioned by their superior or commanded for the
greater glory of God as our Constitution has it

I know it cried Gabriel I know it Tis in the name of all that is
most sacred amongst men that we are encouraged to do evil

My dear son said Father dAigrigny trying to conceal his secret and
growing terror beneath an appearance of wounded dignity from you to me
these words are at least strange

At this Rodin quitted the mantelpiece on which he had been leaning
begin to walk up and down the room with a meditative air and without
ceasing to bite his nails

It is cruel to be obliged to remind you my dear son that your are
indebted to us for the education you have received added Father
dAigrigny

Such were its fruits father replied Gabriel Until then I had been
a spy on the other children from a sort of disinterestedness but the
orders of the superior made me advance another step on that shameful
road I had become an informer to escape a merited punishment And yet
such was my faith my humility my confidence that I performed with
innocence and candor this doubly odious part Once indeed tormented by
vague scruples the last remains of generous aspirations that they were
stifling within me I asked myself if the charitable and religious end
could justify the means and I communicated my doubts to the superior
He replied that I had not to judge but to obey and that to him alone
belonged the responsibility of my acts

Go on my dear son said Father dAigrigny gelding in spite of
himself to the deepest dejection Alas I was right in opposing your
travel to America

And yet it was the will of Providence in that new productive and
free country that enlightened by a singular chance on past and
present my eyes were at length opened Yes cried Gabriel it was in
America that released from the gloomy abode where I had spent so many
years of my youth and finding myself for the first time face to face
with the divine majesty of Nature in the heart of immense solitudes
through which I journeyedit was there that overcome by so much
magnificence and grandeur I made a vow Here Gabriel interrupted
himself to continue Presently father I will explain to you that
vow but believe me added the missionary with an accent of deep
sorrow it was a fatal day to me when I first learned to fear and
condemn all that I had hitherto most revered and blessed Oh I assure
you father added Gabriel with moist eyes it was not for myself
alone that I then wept

I know the goodness of your heart my dear son replied Father
dAigrigny catching a glimpse of hope on seeing Gabriels emotion I
fear that you have been led astray But trust yourself to us as to
your spiritual fathers and I doubt not we shall confirm your faith
so unfortunately shaken and disperse the darkness which at present
obscures your sight Alas my dear son in your vain illusions you have
mistaken some false glimmer for the pure light of day But go on

Whilst Father dAigrigny was thus speaking Rodin stopped took a pocket
book from his coat and wrote down several notes Gabriel was becoming
more and more pale and agitated It required no small courage in him
to speak as he was speaking for since his journey to America he
had learned to estimate the formidable power of the Company But this
revelation of the past looked at from the vantageground of a more
enlightened present was for the young priest the excuse or rather the
cause of the determination he had just signified to his superior and
he wished to explain all faithfully notwithstanding the danger he
knowingly encountered He continued therefore in an agitated voice

You know father that the last days of my childhood that happy age
of frankness and innocent joy were spent in an atmosphere of terror
suspicion and restraint Alas how could I resign myself to the least
impulse of confiding trust when I was recommended to shun the looks of
him who spoke with me in order to hide the impression that his words
might causeto conceal whatever I felt and to observe and listen to
everything Thus I reached the age of fifteen by degrees the rare
visits that I was allowed to pay but always in presence of one of our
fathers to my adopted mother and brother were quite suppressed so as
to shut my heart against all soft and tender emotions Sad and fearful
in that large old noiseless gloomy house I felt that I became more
and more isolated from the affections and the freedom of the world
My time was divided between mutilated studies without connection and
without object and long hours of minute devotional exercises I ask
you father did they ever seek to warm our young souls by words of
tenderness or evangelic love Alas no For the words of the divine
SaviourLove ye one another they had substituted the command Suspect
ye one another Did they ever father speak to us of our country or of
libertyNo ah no for those words make the heart beat high and with
them the heart must not beat at all To our long hours of study and
devotion there only succeeded a few walks three by threenever two
and twobecause by threes the spysystem is more practicable and
because intimacies are more easily formed by two alone and thus might
have arisen some of those generous friendships which also make the
heart beat more than it should15 And so by the habitual repression of
every feeling there came a time when I could not feel at all For six
months I had not seen my adopted mother and brother they came to visit
me at the college a few years before I should have received them with
transports and tears this time my eyes were dry my heart was cold My
mother and brother quitted me weeping The sight of this grief struck me
and I became conscious of the icy insensibility which had been creeping
upon me since I inhabited this tomb Frightened at myself I wished to
leave it while I had still strength to do so Then father I spoke to
you of the choice of a profession for sometimes in waking moments
I seemed to catch from afar the sound of an active and useful life
laborious and free surrounded by family affections Oh then I felt the
want of movement and liberty of noble and warm emotionsof that life
of the soul which fled before me I told it you father on my
knees bathing your hands with my tears The life of a workman or a
soldieranything would have suited me It was then you informed me
that my adopted mother to whom I owed my lifefor she had taken me in
dying of want and poor herself had shared with me the scanty bread
of her childadmirable sacrifice for a motherthat she continued
Gabriel hesitating and casting down his eyes for noble natures blush
for the guilt of others and are ashamed of the infamies of which they
are themselves victims that she that my adopted mother had but one
wish one desire

That of seeing you takes orders my dear son replied Father
dAigrigny for this pious and perfect creature hoped that in
securing your salvation she would provide for her own but she did not
venture to inform you of this thought for fear you might ascribe it to
an interested motive

Enough father said Gabriel interrupting the Abbe dAigrigny with
a movement of involuntary indignation it is painful for me to hear you
assert an error Frances Baudoin never had such a thought

My dear son you are too hasty in your judgments replied Father
dAigrigny mildly I tell you that such was the one sole thought of
your adopted mother

Yesterday father she told me all She and I were equally deceived

Then my dear son said Father dAigrigny sternly you take the word
of your adopted mother before mine

Spare me an answer painful for both of us father said Gabriel
casting down his eyes

Will you now tell me resumed Father dAigrigny with anxiety what
you mean to

The reverend father was unable to finish Samuel entered the room and
said A rather old man wishes to speak to M Rodin

That is my name sir answered the socius in surprise I am much
obliged to you But before following the Jew he gave to Father
dAigrigny a few words written with a pencil upon one of the leaves of
his packetbook

Rodin went out in very uneasy mood to learn who could have come to seek
him in the Rue SaintFrancois Father dAigrigny and Gabriel were left
alone together

14 It is only in respect to Missions that the Jesuits acknowledge the
papal supremacy

15 This rule is so strict in Jesuit Colleges that if one of three
pupils leaves the other two they separate out of earshot till the first
comes back




CHAPTER XX THE RUPTURE

Plunged into a state of mortal anxiety Father dAigrigny had taken
mechanically the note written by Rodin and held it in his hand without
thinking of opening it The reverend father asked himself in alarm what
conclusion Gabriel would draw from these recriminations upon the
past and he durst not make any answer to his reproaches for fear of
irritating the young priest upon whose head such immense interests now
reposed Gabriel could possess nothing for himself according to the
constitutions of the Society of Jesus Moreover the reverend father had
obtained from him in favor of the Order an express renunciation of
all property that might ever come to him But the commencement of his
conversation seemed to announce so serious a change in Gabriels views
with regard to the Company that he might choose to break through the
ties which attached him to it and in that case he would not be legally
bound to fulfil any of his engagements16 The donation would thus be
cancelled de facto just at the moment of being so marvellously realized
by the possession of the immense fortune of the Rennepont family and
dAigrignys hopes would thus be completely and for ever frustrated
Of all these perplexities which the reverend father had experienced
for some time past with regard to this inheritance none had been more
unexpected and terrible than this Fearing to interrupt or question
Gabriel Father dAigrigny waited in mute terror the end of this
interview which already bore so threatening an aspect

The missionary resumed It is my duty father to continue this sketch
of my past life until the moment of my departure for America You will
understand presently why I have imposed on myself this obligation

Father dAigrigny nodded for him to proceed

Once informed of the pretended wishes of my adopted mother I resigned
myself to them though at some cost of feeling I left the gloomy abode
in which I had passed my childhood and part of my youth to enter one
of the seminaries of the Company My resolution was not caused by an
irresistible religious vocation but by a wish to discharge the sacred
debt I owed my adopted mother Yet the true spirit of the religion of
Christ is so vivifying that I felt myself animated and warmed by the
idea of carrying out the adorable precepts of our Blessed Saviour To my
imagination a seminary instead of resembling the college where I had
lived in painful restraint appeared like a holy place where all that
was pure and warm in the fraternity of the Gospel would be applied to
common lifewhere for example the lessons most frequently taught
would be the ardent love of humanity and the ineffable sweets of
commiseration and tolerancewhere the everlasting words of Christ
would be interpreted in their broadest senseand where in fine by
the habitual exercise and expansion of the most generous sentiments men
were prepared for the magnificent apostolic mission of making the rich
and happy sympathize with the sufferings of their brethren by unveiling
the frightful miseries of humanitya sublime and sacred morality which
none are able to withstand when it is preached with eyes full of tears
and hearts overflowing with tenderness and charity

As he delivered these last words with profound emotion Gabriels eyes
became moist and his countenance shone with angelic beauty

Such is indeed my dear son the spirit of Christianity but one must
also study and explain the letter answered Father dAigrigny coldly
It is to this study that the seminaries of our Company are specially
destined Now the interpretation of the letter is a work of analysis
discipline and submissionand not one of heart and sentiment

I perceive that only too well father On entering this new house I
found alas all my hopes defeated Dilating for a moment my heart soon
sunk within me Instead of this centre of life affection youth of
which I had dreamed I found in the silent and icecold seminary
the same suppression of every generous emotion the same inexorable
discipline the same system of mutual prying the same suspicion the
same invincible obstacles to all ties of friendship The ardor which had
warmed my soul for an instant soon died out little by little I fell
back into the habits of a stagnant passive mechanical life governed
by a pitiless power with mechanical precision just like the inanimate
works of a watch

But order submission and regularity are the first foundations of our
Company my dear son

Alas father it was death not life that I found thus organized In
the midst of this destruction of every generous principle I devoted
myself to scholastic and theological studiesgloomy studiesa wily
menacing and hostile science which always awake to ideas of peril
contest and war is opposed to all those of peace progress and
liberty

Theology my dear son said Father dAigrigny sternly is at once
a buckler and a sword a buckler to protect and cover the Catholic
faitha sword to attack and combat heresy

And yet father Christ and His apostles knew not this subtle science
their simple and touching words regenerated mankind and set freedom
over slavery Does not the divine code of the Gospel suffice to teach
men to love one another But alas far from speaking to us this
language our attention was too often occupied with wars of religion
and the rivers of blood that had flowed in honor of the Lord and for
the destruction of heresy These terrible lessons made our life still
more melancholy As we grew near to manhood our relations at the
seminary assumed a growing character of bitterness jealousy and
suspicion The habit of tale bearing against each other applied to more
serious subjects engendered silent hate and profound resentments I
was neither better nor worse than the others All of us bowed down
for years beneath the iron yoke of passive obedience unaccustomed to
reflection or freewill humble and trembling before our superiors had
the same pale dull colorless disposition At last I took orders once
a priest you invited me father to enter the Company of Jesus or
rather I found myself insensibly brought to this determination How
I do not know For a long time before my will was not my own I went
through all my proofs the most terrible was decisive for some months
I lived in the silence of my cell practicing with resignation the
strange and mechanical exercises that you ordered me With the exception
of your reverence nobody approached me during that long space of time
no human voice but yours sounded in my ear Sometimes in the night
I felt vague terrors my mind weakened by fasting austerity and
solitude was impressed with frightful visions At other times on the
contrary I felt a sort of quiescence in the idea that having once
pronounced my vows I should be delivered for ever from the burden of
thought and will Then I abandoned myself to an insurmountable torpor
like those unfortunate wretches who surprised by a snowstorm
yield to a suicidal repose Thus I awaited the fatal moment At last
according to the rule of discipline choking with the death rattle17
I hastened the moment of accomplishing the final act of my expiring
willthe vow to renounce it for ever

Remember my dear son replied Father dAigrigny pale and tortured by
increasing anguish remember that on the eve of the day fixed for
the completion of your vows I offered according to the rule of our
Company to absolve you from joining usleaving you completely free
for we accept none but voluntary vocations

It is true father answered Gabriel with sorrowful bitterness
when worn out and broken by three months of solitude and trial I was
completely exhausted and unable to move a step you opened the door
of my cell and said to me If you like rise and walk you are free
Alas I had no more strength The only desire of my soul inert and
paralyzed for so long a period was the repose of the grave and
pronouncing those irrevocable vows I fell like a corpse into your
hands

And till now my dear son you have never failed in this corpselike
obedienceto use the expression of our glorious founderbecause the
more absolute this obedience the more meritorious it must be

After a moments silence Gabriel resumed You had always concealed
from me father the true ends of the Society into which I entered I
was asked to abandon my freewill to my superiors in the name of the
Greater Glory of God My vows once pronounced I was to be in your hands
a docile and obedient instrument but I was to be employed you told me
in a holy great and beauteous work I believed you fatherhow should
I not have believed you but a fatal event changed my destinya painful
malady caused by

My son cried Father dAigrigny interrupting Gabriel it is useless
to recall these circumstances

Pardon me father I must recall them I have the right to be heard I
cannot pass over in silence any of the facts which have led me to take
the immutable resolution that I am about to announce to you

Speak on my son said Father dAigrigny frowning for he was much
alarmed at the words of the young priest whose cheeks until now pale
were covered with a deep blush

Six months before my departure for America resumed Gabriel casting
down his eyes you informed me that I was destined to confess
penitents and to prepare then for that sacred ministry you gave me a
book

Gabriel again hesitated His blushes increased Father dAigrigny could
scarcely restrain a start of impatience and anger

You gave me a book resumed the young priest with a great effort
to control himself a book containing questions to be addressed by
a confessor to youths and young girls and married women when they
present themselves at the tribunal of penance My God added Gabriel
shuddering at the remembrance I shall never forget that awful moment
It was night I had retired to my chamber taking with me this book
composed you told me by one of our fathers and completed by a holy
bishop18 Full of respect faith and confidence I opened those
pages At first I did not understand themafterwards I understoodand
then I was seized with shame and horrorstruck with stuporand had
hardly strength to close with trembling hand this abominable volume
I ran to you father to accuse myself of having involuntarily cast my
eyes on those nameless pages which by mistake you had placed in my
hands

Remember also my dear son said Father dAigrigny gravely that I
calmed your scruples and told you that a priest who is bound to
hear everything under the seal of confession must be able to know and
appreciate everything and that our Company imposes the task of reading
this Compendium as a classical work upon young deacons seminarists
and priests who are destined to be confessors

I believed you father In me the habit of inert obedience was so
powerful and I was so unaccustomed to independent reflection that
notwithstanding my horror with which I now reproached myself as with
a crime I took the volume back into my chamber and read Oh father
what a dreadful revelation of criminal fancies guilty of guiltiest in
their refinement

You speak of this book in blamable terms skid Father dAigrigny
severely you were the victim of a too lively imagination It is to it
that you must attribute this fatal impression and not to an excellent
work irreproachable for its special purpose and duly authorized by the
Church You are not able to judge of such a production

I will speak of it no more father said Gabriel and he thus resumed
A long illness followed that terrible night Many times they feared
for my reason When I recovered the past appeared to me like a painful
dream You told me then father that I was not yet ripe for certain
functions and it was then that I earnestly entreated you to be allowed
to go on the American missions After having long refused my prayer
you at length consented From my childhood I had always lived in the
college or seminary to a state of continual restraint and subjection
By constantly holding down my head and eyes I had lost the habit of
contemplating the heavens and the splendors of nature But oh
what deep religious happiness I felt when I found myself suddenly
transported to the centre of the imposing grandeur of the seashalfway
between the ocean and the skyI seemed to come forth from a place of
thick darkness for the first time for many years I felt my heart beat
freely in my bosom for the first time I felt myself master of my own
thoughts and ventured to examine my past life as from the summit of
a mountain one looks down into a gloomy vale Then strange doubts rose
within me I asked myself by what right and for what end any beings
had so long repressed almost annihilated the exercise of my will of
my liberty of my reason since God had endowed me with these gifts But
I said to myself that perhaps one day the great beauteous and holy
work in which I was to have my share would be revealed to me and
would recompense my obedience and resignation

At this moment Rodin reentered the room Father dAigrigny questioned
him with a significant look The socius approached and said to him in
a low voice so that Gabriel could not hear Nothing serious It was
only to inform me that Marshal Simons father is arrived at M Hardys
factory

Then glancing at Gabriel Rodin appeared to interrogate Father
dAigrigny who hung his head with a desponding air Yet he resumed
again addressing Gabriel whilst Rodin took his old place with his
elbow on the chimneypiece Go on my dear son I am anxious to learn
what resolution you have adopted

I will tell you in a moment father I arrived at Charleston The
superior of our establishment in that place to whom I imparted my
doubts as to the object of our Society took upon himself to clear them
up and unveiled it all to me with alarming frankness He told me the
tendency not perhaps of all the members of the Company for a great
number must have shared my ignorancebut the objects which our leaders
have pertinaciously kept in view ever since the foundation of the
Order I was terrified I read the casuists Oh father that was a
new and dreadful revelation when at every page I read the excuse and
justification of robbery slander adultery perjury murder regicide
When I considered that I the priest of a God of charity justice
pardon and love was to belong henceforth to a Company whose chiefs
professed and glorified in such doctrines I made a solemn oath to break
for ever the ties which bound me to it19

On these words of Gabriel Father dAigrigny and Rodin exchanged a look
of terror All was lost their prey had escaped them Deeply moved by
the remembrances he recalled Gabriel did not perceive the action of
the reverend father and the socius and thus continued In spite of my
resolution father to quit the Company the discovery I had made was
very painful to me Oh believe me for the honest and loving soul
nothing is more frightful than to have to renounce what it has long
respectedI suffered so much that when I thought of the dangers of
my mission I hoped with a secret joy that God would perhaps take me
to Himself under these circumstances but on the contrary He watched
over me with providential solicitude

As he said this Gabriel felt a thrill for he remembered a Mysterious
Woman who had saved his life in America After a moments silence he
resumed My mission terminated I returned hither to beg father that
you would release me from my vows Many times but in vain I solicited
an interview Yesterday it pleased Providence that I should have a long
conversation with my adopted mother from her I learned the trick by
which my vocation had been forced upon meand the sacrilegious abuse
of the confessional by which she had been induced to entrust to other
persons the orphans that a dying mother had confided to the care of
an honest soldier You understand father that if even I had before
hesitated to break these bonds what I have heard yesterday must have
rendered my decision irrevocable But at this solemn moment father
I am bound to tell you that I do not accuse the whole Society many
simple credulous and confiding men like myself must no doubt form
part of it Docile instruments they see not in their blindness the work
to which they are destined I pity them and pray God to enlighten them
as he has enlightened me

So my son said Father dAigrigny rising with livid and despairing
look you come to ask of me to break the ties which attach you to the
Society

Yes father you received my vowsit is for you to release me from
them

So my son you understand that engagements once freely taken by you
are now to be considered as null and void

Yes father

So my son there is to be henceforth nothing in common between you and
our Company

No fathersince I request you to absolve me of my vows

But you know my son that the Society may release youbut that you
cannot release yourself

The step I take proves to you father the importance I attach to an
oath since I come to you to release me from it Nevertheless were
you to refuse me I should not think myself bound in the eyes of God or
man

It is perfectly clear said Father dAigrigny to Rodin his voice
expiring upon his lips so deep was his despair

Suddenly whilst Gabriel with downcast eyes waited for the answer
of Father dAigrigny who remained mute and motionless Rodin appeared
struck with a new idea on perceiving that the reverend father still
held in his hand the note written in pencil The socius hastily
approached Father dAigrigny and said to him in a whisper with a look
of doubt and alarm Have you not read my note

I did not think of it answered the reverend father mechanically

Rodin appeared to make a great effort to repress a movement of violent
rage Then he said to Father dAigrigny in a calm voice Read it now

Hardly had the reverend father cast his eyes upon this note than
a sudden ray of hope illumined his hitherto despairing countenance
Pressing the hand of the socius with an expression of deep gratitude he
said to him in a low voice You are right Gabriel is ours

16 The statutes formally state that the Company can expel all drones
and wasps but that no man can break his ties if the Order wishes to
retain him

17 This is their own command The constitution expressly bids the
novice wait for this decisive climax of the ordeal before taking the
vows of God

18 It is impossible even in Latin to give our readers an idea of
this infamous work

19 This is true See the extracts from the Compendium for the use of
Schools published under the title of Discoveries by a Bibliophilist
Strasburg 1843 For regicide see Sanchez and others




CHAPTER XXI THE CHANGE

Before again addressing Gabriel Father dAigrigny carefully reflected
and his countenance lately so disturbed became gradually once more
serene He appeared to meditate and calculate the effects of the
eloquence he was about to employ upon an excellent and safe theme
which the socius struck with the danger of the situation had suggested
in a few lines rapidly written with a pencil and which in his despair
the reverend father had at first neglected Rodin resumed his post of
observation near the mantelpiece on which he leaned his elbow
after casting at Father dAigrigny a glance of disdainful and angry
superiority accompanied by a significant shrug of the shoulders

After this involuntary manifestation which was luckily not perceived
by Father dAigrigny the cadaverous face of the socius resumed its
icy calmness and his flabby eyelids raised a moment with anger and
impatience fell and halfveiled his little dull eyes It must be
confessed that Father dAigrigny notwithstanding the ease and elegance
of his speech notwithstanding the seduction of his exquisite manners
his agreeable features and the exterior of an accomplished and refined
man of the world was often subdued and governed by the unpitying
firmness the diabolical craft and depth of Rodin the old repulsive
dirty miserably dressed man who seldom abandoned his humble part of
secretary and mute auditor The influence of education is so powerful
that Gabriel notwithstanding the formal rupture he had just provoked
felt himself still intimidated in presence of Father dAigrigny and
waited with painful anxiety for the answer of the reverend father to his
express demand to be released from his old vows His reverence having
doubtless regularly laid his plan of attack at length broke silence
heaved a deep sigh gave to his countenance lately so severe and
irritated a touching expression of kindness and said to Gabriel in an
affectionate voice Forgive me my dear son for having kept silence
so long but your abrupt determination has so stunned me and has raised
within me so many painful thoughts that I have had to reflect for some
moments to try and penetrate the cause of this rupture and I think
I have succeeded You have well considered my dear son the serious
nature of the step you are taking

Yes father

And you have absolutely decided to abandon the Society even against my
will

It would be painful to me fatherbut I must resign myself to it

It should be very painful to you indeed my dear son for you took the
irrevocable vow freely and this vow according to our statutes binds
you not to quit the Society unless with the consent of your superiors

I did not then know father the nature of the engagement I took More
enlightened now I ask to withdraw myself my only desire is to obtain
a curacy in some village far from Paris I feel an irresistible vocation
for such humble and useful functions In the country there is so much
misery and such ignorance of all that could contribute to ameliorate
the condition of the agricultural laborer that his existence is as
unhappy as that of a negro slave for what liberty has he and what
instruction Oh it seems to me that with Gods help I might as a
village curate render some services to humanity It would therefore be
painful to me father to see you refuse

Be satisfied my son answered Father dAigrigny I will no longer
seek to combat your desire to separate yourself from us

Then father you release me from my vows

I have not the power to do so my dear son but I will write
immediately to Rome to ask the necessary authority from our general

I thank you father

Soon my dear son you will be delivered from these bonds which you
deem so heavy and the men you abandon will not the less continue to
pray for you that God may preserve you from still greater wanderings
You think yourself released with regard to us my dear son but we do
not think ourselves released with regard to you It is not thus that we
can get rid of the habit of paternal attachment What would you have We
look upon ourselves as bound to our children by the very benefits with
which we have loaded them You were poor and an orphan we stretched
out our arms to you as much from the interest which you deserved my
dear son as to spare your excellent adopted mother too great a burden

Father said Gabriel with suppressed emotion I am not ungrateful

I wish to believe so my dear son For long years we gave to you as
to our beloved child food for the body and the soul It pleases you now
to renounce and abandon us Not only do we consent to itbut now that I
have penetrated the true motives of your rupture with us it is my duty
to release you from your vow

Of what motives do you speak Father

Alas my dear son I understand your fears Dangers menace usyou know
it well

Dangers father cried Gabriel

It is impossible my dear son that you should not be aware that
since the fall of our legitimate sovereigns our natural protectors
revolutionary impiety becomes daily more and more threatening We
are oppressed with persecutions I can therefore comprehend and
appreciate my dear son the motive which under such circumstances
induces you to separate from us

Father cried Gabriel with as much indignation as grief you do not
think that of meyou cannot think it

Without noticing the protestations of Gabriel Father dAigrigny
continued his imaginary picture of the dangers of the Company which
far from being really in peril was already beginning secretly to
recover its influence

Oh if our Company were now as powerful as it was some years ago
resumed the reverend father if it were still surrounded by the respect
and homage which are due to it from all true believersin spite of the
abominable calumnies with which we are assailedthen my dear son we
should perhaps have hesitated to release you from your vows and have
rather endeavored to open your eyes to the light and save you from
the fatal delusion to which you are a prey But now that we are weak
oppressed threatened on every side it is our duty it is an act of
charity not to force you to share in perils from which you have the
prudence to wish to withdraw yourself

So saying Father dAigrigny cast a rapid glance at his socius
who answered with a nod of approbation accompanied by a movement of
impatience that seemed to say Go on go on

Gabriel was quite overcome There was not in the whole world a heart
more generous loyal and brave than his We may judge of what he
must have suffered on hearing the resolution he had come to thus
misinterpreted

Father he resumed in an agitated voice whilst his eyes filled
with tears your words are cruel and unjust You know that I am not a
coward

No said Rodin in his sharp cutting voice addressing Father
dAigrigny and pointing to Gabriel with a disdainful look your dear
son is only prudent

These words from Rodin made Gabriel start a slight blush colored his
pale cheeks his large and blue eyes sparkled with a generous anger
then faithful to the precepts of Christian humility and resignation
he conquered this irritable impulse hung down his head and too much
agitated to reply remained silent and brushed away an unseen tear
This tear did not escape the notice of the socius He saw in it no
doubt a favorable symptom for he exchanged a glance of satisfaction
with Father dAigrigny The latter was about to touch on a question of
great interest so notwithstanding his selfcommand his voice trembled
slightly but encouraged or rather pushed on by a look from Rodin
who had become extremely attentive he said to Gabriel Another motive
obliges us not to hesitate in releasing you from your vow my dear son
It is a question of pure delicacy You probably learned yesterday
from your adopted mother that you will perhaps be called upon to take
possession of an inheritance of which the value is unknown

Gabriel raised his head hastily and said to Father dAigrigny As I
have already stated to M Rodin my adopted mother only talked of her
scruples of conscience and I was completely ignorant of the existence
of the inheritance of which you speak

The expression of indifference with which the young priest pronounced
these last words was remarked by Rodin

Be it so replied Father dAigrigny You were not aware of itI
believe youthough all appearances would tend to prove the contraryto
prove indeed that the knowledge of this inheritance was not
unconnected with your resolution to separate from us

I do not understand you Father

It is very simple Your rupture with us would then have two motives
First we are in danger and you think it prudent to leave us

Father

Allow me to finish my dear son and come to the second motive If I
am deceived you can tell me so These are the facts Formerly on the
hypothesis that your family of which you knew nothing might one day
leave you some property you made in return for the care bestowed on
you by the Company a free gift of all you might hereafter possess not
to usbut to the poor of whom we are the born shepherds

Well father asked Gabriel not seeing to what this preamble tended

Well my dear sonnow that you are sure of enjoying a competence you
wish no doubt by separating from us to annul this donation made under
other circumstances

To speak plainly you violate your oath because we are persecuted
and because you wish to take back your gifts added Rodin in a
sharp voice as if to describe in the clearest and plainest manner the
situation of Gabriel with regard to the Society

At this infamous accusation Gabriel could only raise his hands and eyes
to heaven and exclaim with an expression of despair Oh heaven

Once more exchanging a look of intelligence with Rodin Father
dAigrigny said to him in a severe tone as if reproaching him for his
too savage frankness I think you go too far Our dear son could only
have acted in the base and cowardly manner you suggest had he known his
position as an heir but since he affirms the contrary we are bound to
believe himin spite of appearances

Father said Gabriel pale agitated trembling and with half
suppressed grief and indignation I thank you at least for having
suspended your judgment No I am not a coward for heaven is my
witness that I knew of no danger to which the Society was exposed Nor
am I base and avaricious for heaven is also my witness that only at
this moment I learn from you father that I may be destined to inherit
property and

One word my dear son It is quite lately that I became informed of
this circumstance by the greatest chance in the world said Father
dAigrigny interrupting Gabriel and that was thanks to some family
papers which your adopted mother had given to her confessor and which
were entrusted to us when you entered our college A little before your
return from America in arranging the archives of the Company your file
of papers fell into the hands of our fatherattorney It was examined
and we thus learned that one of your paternal ancestors to whom the
house in which we now are belonged left a will which is to be opened to
day at noon Yesterday we believed you one of us our statutes command
that we should possess nothing of our own you had corroborated those
statutes by a donation in favor of the patrimony of the poorwhich we
administer It was no longer you therefore but the Company which in
my person presented itself as the inheritor in your place furnished
with your titles which I have here ready in order But now my clear
son that you separate from us you must present yourself in your own
name We came here as the representatives of the poor to whom in former
days you piously abandoned whatever goods might fall to your share Now
on the contrary the hope of a fortune changes your sentiments You are
free to resume your gifts

Gabriel had listened to Father dAigrigny with painful impatience At
length he exclaimed Do you mean to say father that you think me
capable of canceling a donation freely made in favor of the Company to
which I am indebted for my education You believe me infamous enough to
break my word in the hope of possessing a modest patrimony

This patrimony my dear son may be small but it may also be
considerable

Well father if it were a kings fortune cried Gabriel with proud
and noble indifference I should not speak otherwiseand I have
I think the right to be believed listen to my fixed resolution The
Company to which I belong runs you say great dangers I will inquire
into these dangers Should they prove threateningstrong in the
determination which morally separates me from youI will not leave you
till I see the end of your perils As for the inheritance of which you
believe me so desirous I resign it to you formally father as I once
freely promised My only wish is that this property may be employed
for the relief of the poor I do not know what may be the amount of this
fortune but large or small it belongs to the Company because I have
thereto pledged my word I have told you father that my chief
desire is to obtain a humble curacy in some poor villagepoor above
allbecause there my services will be most useful Thus father when a
man who never spoke falsehood in his life affirms to you that he only
sighs for so humble an existence you ought I think to believe him
incapable of snatching back from motives of avarice gifts already
made

Father dAigrigny had now as much trouble to restrain his joy as he
before had to conceal his terror He appeared however tolerably calm
and said to Gabriel I did not expect less from you my dear son

Then he made a sign to Rodin to invite him to interpose The latter
perfectly understood his superior He left the chimney drew near
to Gabriel and leaned against the table upon which stood paper and
inkstand Then beginning mechanically to beat the tattoo with the tips
of his coarse fingers in all their array of flat and dirty nails he
said to Father dAigrigny All this is very fine but your dear son
gives you no security for the fulfilment of his promise except an
oathand that we know is of little value

Sir cried Gabriel

Allow me said Rodin coldly The law does not acknowledge our
existence and therefore can take no cognizance of donations made in
favor of the Company You might resume tomorrow what you are pleased to
give us today

But my oath sir cried Gabriel

Rodin looked at him fixedly as he answered Your oath Did you not
swear eternal obedience to the Company and never to separate from
usand of what weight now are these oaths

For a moment Gabriel was embarrassed but feeling how false was this
logic he rose calm and dignified went to seat himself at the desk
took up a pen and wrote as follows

Before God who sees and hears me and in the presence of you Father
dAigrigny and M Rodin I renew and confirm freely and voluntarily
the absolute donation made by me to the Society of Jesus in the person
of the said Father dAigrigny of all the property which may hereafter
belong to me whatever may be its value I swear on pain of infamy to
perform tis irrevocable promise whose accomplishment I regard in my
soul and conscience as the discharge of a debt and the fulfilment of a
pious duty

This donation having for its object the acknowledgment of past
services and the relief of the poor no future occurrences can at
all modify it For the very reason that I know I could one day legally
cancel the present free and deliberate act I declare that if ever I
were to attempt such a thing under any possible circumstances I should
deserve the contempt and horror of all honest people

In witness whereof I have written this paper on the 13th of February
1832 in Paris immediately before the opening of the testament of one
of my paternal ancestors

GABRIEL DE RENNEPONT

As he rose the young priest delivered this document to Rodin without
uttering a word The socius read it attentively and still impassible
answered as he looked at Gabriel Well it is a written oaththat is
all

Gabriel dwelt stupefied at the audacity of Rodin who ventured to tell
him that this document in which he renewed his donation in so noble
generous and spontaneous a manner was not all sufficient The
socius was the first again to break the silence and he said to Father
dAigrigny with his usual cool impudence One of two things must be
Either your dear son means to render his donation absolutely valuable
and irrevocableor

Sir exclaimed Gabriel interrupting him and hardly able to restrain
himself spare yourself and me such a shameful supposition

Well then resumed Rodin impassible as ever as you are perfectly
decided to make this donation a serious reality what objection can you
have to secure it legally

None sir said Gabriel bitterly since my written and sworn promise
will not suffice you

My dear son said Father dAigrigny affectionately if this were
a donation for my own advantage believe me I should require no better
security than your word But here I am as it were the agent of the
Society or rather the trustee of the poor who will profit by your
generosity For the sake of humanity therefore we cannot secure this
gift by too many legal precautions so that the unfortunate objects of
our care may have certainty instead of vague hopes to depend upon God
may call you to him at any moment and who shall say that your heirs
will be so ready to keep the oath you have taken

You are right father said Gabriel sadly I had not thought of the
case of death which is yet so probable

Hereupon Samuel opened the door of the room and said Gentlemen the
notary has just arrived Shall I show him in At ten oclock precisely
the door of the house will be opened

We are the more glad to see the notary said Rodin as we just happen
to have some business with him Pray ask him to walk in

I will bring him to you instantly replied Samuel as he went out

Here is a notary said Rodin to Gabriel If you have still the same
intentions you can legalize your donation in presence of this public
officer and thus save yourself from a great burden for the future

Sir said Gabriel happen what may I am as irrevocably engaged by
this written promise which I beg you to keep fatherand he handed
the paper to Father dAigrigny as by the legal document which I am
about to sign he added turning to Rodin

Silence my dear son said Father dAigrigny here is the notary
just as the latter entered the room

During the interview of the administrative officer with Rodin Gabriel
and Father dAigrigny we shall conduct the reader to the interior of
the walledup house




CHAPTER XXII THE RED ROOM

As Samuel had said the door of the walledup house had just been
disencumbered of the bricks lead and iron which had kept it from
view and its panels of carved oak appeared as fresh and sound as on
the day when they had first been withdrawn from the influence of the air
and time The laborers having completed their work stood waiting
upon the steps as impatient and curious as the notarys clerk who
had superintended the operation when they saw Samuel slowly advancing
across the garden with a great bunch of keys in his hand

Now my friends said the old man when he had reached the steps
your work is finished The master of this gentleman will pay you and I
have only to show you out by the street door

Come come my good fellow cried the clerk you dont think We
are just at the most interesting and curious moment I and these honest
masons are burning to see the interior of this mysterious house and you
would be cruel enough to send us away Impossible

I regret the necessity sir but so it must he I must be the first to
enter this dwelling absolutely alone before introducing the heirs in
order to read the testament

And who gave you such ridiculous and barbarous orders cried the
clerk singularly disappointed

My father sir

A most respectable authority no doubt but come my worthy guardian
my excellent guardian resumed the clerk be a good fellow and let us
just take a peep in at the door

Yes yes sir only a peep cried the heroes of the trowel with a
supplicating air

It is disagreeable to have to refuse you gentlemen answered Samuel
but I cannot open this door until I am alone

The masons seeing the inflexibility of the old man unwillingly
descended the steps but the clerk had resolved to dispute the ground
inch by inch and exclaimed I shall wait for my master I do not leave
the house without him He may want meand whether I remain on these
steps or elsewhere can be of little consequence to you my worthy
keeper

The clerk was interrupted in his appeal by his master himself who
called out from the further side of the courtyard with an air of
business M Piston quick M Pistoncome directly

What the devil does he want with me cried the clerk in a passion
He calls me just at the moment when I might have seen something

M Piston resumed the voice approaching do you not hear

While Samuel let out the masons the clerk saw through a clump of
trees his master running towards him bareheaded and with an air of
singular haste and importance The clerk was therefore obliged to leave
the steps to answer the notarys summons towards whom he went with a
very bad grace

Sir sir said M Dumesnil I have been calling you this hour with
all my might

I did not hear you sir said M Piston

You must be deaf then Have you any change about you

Yes sir answered the clerk with some surprise

Well then you must go instantly to the nearest stampoffice and
fetch me three or four large sheets of stamped paper to draw up a deed
Run it is wanted directly

Yes sir said the clerk casting a rueful and regretful glance at the
door of the walledup house

But make haste will you M Piston said the notary

I do not know sir where to get any stamped paper

Here is the guardian replied M Dumesnil He will no doubt be able
to tell you

At this instant Samuel was returning after showing the masons out by
the streetdoor

Sir said the notary to him will you please to tell me where we can
get stamped paper

Close by sir answered Samuel in the tobacconists No 17 Rue
VieilleduTemple

You hear M Piston said the notary to his clerk You can get the
stamps at the tobacconists No 17 Rue VieilleduTemple Be quick
for this deed must be executed immediately before the opening of the
will Time presses

Very well sir I will make haste answered the clerk discontentedly
as he followed his master who hurried back into the room where he had
left Rodin Gabriel and Father dAigrigny

During this time Samuel ascending the steps had reached the door
now disencumbered of the stone iron and lead with which it had been
blocked up It was with deep emotion that the old man having selected
from his bunch of keys the one he wanted inserted it in the keyhole
and made the door turn upon its hinges Immediately he felt on his
face a current of damp cold air like that which exhales from a cellar
suddenly opened Having carefully reclosed and doublelocked the door
the Jew advanced along the hall lighted by a glass trefoil over the
arch of the door The panes had lost their transparency by the effect of
time and now had the appearance of groundglass This hall paved with
alternate squares of black and white marble was vast sonorous and
contained a broad staircase leading to the first story The walls of
smooth stone offered not the least appearance of decay or dampness the
stairrail of wrought iron presented no traces of rust it was inserted
just above the bottom step into a column of gray granite which
sustained a statue of black marble representing a negro bearing a
flambeau This statue had a strange countenance the pupils of the eyes
being made of white marble

The Jews heavy tread echoed beneath the lofty dome of the hall
The grandson of Isaac Samuel experienced a melancholy feeling as he
reflected that the footsteps of his ancestor had probably been the last
which had resounded through this dwelling of which he had closed the
doors a hundred and fifty years before for the faithful friend
in favor of whom M de Rennepont had made a feigned transfer of the
property had afterwards parted with the same to place it in the name
of Samuels grandfather who had transmitted it to his descendants as
if it had been his own inheritance

To these thoughts in which Samuel was wholly absorbed was joined the
remembrance of the light seen that morning through the seven openings in
the leaden cover of the belvedere and in spite of the firmness of his
character the old man could not repress a shudder as taking a second
key from his bunch and reading upon the label The Key of the Red
Room he opened a pair of large folding doors leading to the inner
apartments The window which of all those in the house had alone been
opened lighted this large room hung with damask the deep purple of
which had undergone no alteration A thick Turkey carpet covered the
floor and large armchairs of gilded wood in the severe Louis XIV
style were symmetrically arranged along the wall A second door
leading to the next room was just opposite the entrance The
wainscoting and the cornice were white relieved with fillets and
mouldings of burnished gold On each side of this door was a large
piece of buhlfurniture inlaid with brass and porcelain supporting
ornamental sets of sea crackle vases The window was hung with heavy
deepfringed damask curtains surmounted by scalloped drapery with
silk tassels directly opposite the chimneypiece of darkgray marble
adorned with carved brasswork Rich chandeliers and a clock in the
same style as the furniture were reflected in a large Venice glass
with basiled edges A round table covered with a cloth of crimson
velvet was placed in the centre of this saloon

As he approached this table Samuel perceived a piece of white vellum
on which were inscribed these words My testament is to be opened in
this saloon The other apartments are to remain closed until after the
reading of my last willM De R

Yes said the Jew as he perused with emotion these lines traced so
long ago this is the same recommendation as that which I received from
my father for it would seem that the other apartments of this house are
filled with objects on which M de Rennepont set a high value not for
their intrinsic worth but because of their origin The Hall of Mourning
must be a strange and mysterious chamber Well added Samuel as he
drew from his pocket a register bound in black shagreen with a brass
lock from which he drew the key after placing it upon the table here
is the statement of the property in hand which I have been ordered to
bring hither before the arrival of the heirs

The deepest silence reigned in the room at the moment when Samuel
placed the register on the table Suddenly a simple and yet most
startling occurrence roused him from his reverie In the next apartment
was heard the clear silvery tone of a clock striking slowly ten And
the hour was ten Samuel had too much sense to believe in perpetual
motion or in the possibility of constructing a clock to go far one
hundred and fifty years He asked himself therefore with surprise and
alarm how this clock could still be going and how it could mark so
exactly the hour of the day Urged with restless curiosity the old man
was about to enter the room but recollecting the recommendation of his
father which had now been confirmed by the few lines he had just read
from De Renneponts pen he stopped at the door and listened with
extreme attention

He heard nothingabsolutely nothing but the last dying vibration of
the clock After having long reflected upon this strange fact Samuel
comparing it with the no less extraordinary circumstance of the light
perceived that morning through the apertures in the belvedere concluded
that there must be some connection between these two incidents If
the old man could not penetrate the true cause of these extraordinary
appearances he at least explained them to himself by remembering the
subterraneous communications which according to tradition were said
to exist between the cellars of this house and distant places and he
conjectured that unknown and mysterious personages thus gained access
to it two or three times in a century Absorbed in these thoughts Samuel
approached the fireplace which as we have said was directly opposite
the window Just then a bright ray of sunlight piercing the clouds
shone full upon two large portraits hung upon either side of the
fireplace and not before remarked by the Jew They were painted life
size and represented one a woman the other a man By the sober yet
powerful coloring of these paintings by the large and vigorous style
it was easy to recognize a masters hand It would have been difficult
to find models more fitted to inspire a great painter The woman
appeared to be from fiveandtwenty to thirty years of age Magnificent
brown hair with golden tints crooned a forehead white noble and
lofty Her headdress far from recalling the fashion which Madame de
Sevigne brought in during the age of Louis XIV reminded one rather of
some of the portraits of Paul Veronese in which the hair encircles the
face in broad undulating bands surmounted by a thick plait like a
crown at the back of the head The eyebrows finely pencilled were
arched over large eyes of bright sapphire blue Their gaze at once
proud and mournful had something fatal about it The nose finely
formed terminated in slight dilated nostrils a half smile almost
of pain contracted the mouth the face was a long oval and the
complexion extremely pale was hardly shaded on the cheek by a light
rosecolor The position of the head and neck announced a rare mixture
of grace and dignity A sort of tunic or robe of glossy black material
came as high as the commencement of her shoulders and just marking
her lithe and tall figure reached down to her feet which were almost
entirely concealed by the folds of this garment

The attitude was full of nobleness and simplicity The head looked white
and luminous standing out from a dark gray sky marbled at the horizon
by purple clouds upon which were visible the bluish summits of distant
hills in deep shadow The arrangement of the picture as well as the
warm tints of the foreground contrasting strongly with these distant
objects showed that the woman was placed upon an eminence from which
she could view the whole horizon The countenance was deeply pensive and
desponding There was an expression of supplicating and resigned grief
particularly in her look half raised to heaven which one would have
thought impossible to picture On the left side of the fireplace was the
other portrait painted with like vigor It represented a man between
thirty and thirtyfive years of age of tall stature A large brown
cloak which hung round him in graceful folds did not quite conceal a
black doublet buttoned up to the neck over which fell a square white
collar The handsome and expressive head was marked with stern powerful
lines which did not exclude an admirable air of suffering resignation
and ineffable goodness The hair as well as the beard and eyebrows was
black and the latter by some singular caprice of nature instead
of being separated and forming two distinct arches extended from one
temple to the other in a single bow and seemed to mark the forehead of
this man with a black line

The background of this picture also represented a stormy sky but
beyond some rocks in the distance the sea was visible and appeared to
mingle with the dark clouds The sun just now shining upon these two
remarkable figures which it appeared impossible to forget after once
seeing them augmented their brilliancy

Starting from his reverie and casting his eyes by chance upon these
portraits Samuel was greatly struck with them They appeared almost
alive What noble and handsome faces he exclaimed as he approached
to examine them more closely Whose are these portraits They are not
those of any of the Rennepont family for my father told me that they
are all in the Hall of Mourning Alas added the old man one might
think from the great sorrow expressed in their countenances that they
ought to have a place in that mourningchamber

After a moments silence Samuel resumed Let me prepare everything for
this solemn assembly for it has struck ten So saying he placed the
gilded armchairs round the table and then continued with a pensive
air The hour approaches and of the descendants of my grandfathers
benefactor we have seen only this young priest with the angelic
countenance Can he be the sole representative of the Rennepont family
He is a priest and this family will finish with him Well the moment
is come when I must open this door that the will may be read Bathsheba
is bringing hither the notary They knock at the door it is time And
Samuel after casting a last glance towards the place where the clock
had struck ten hastened to the outer door behind which voices were now
audible

He turned the key twice in the lock and threw the portals open To his
great regret he saw only Gabriel on the steps between Rodin and Father
dAigrigny The notary and Bathsheba who had served them as a guide
waited a little behind the principal group

Samuel could not repress a sigh as he stood bowing on the threshold
and said to them All is ready gentlemen You may walk in




CHAPTER XXIII THE TESTAMENT

When Gabriel Rodin and Father dAigrigny entered the Red Room they
were differently affected Gabriel pale and sad felt a kind of painful
impatience He was anxious to quit this house though he had already
relieved himself of a great weight by executing before the notary
secured by every legal formality a deed making over all his rights of
inheritance to Father dAigrigny Until now it had not occurred to the
young priest that in bestowing the care upon him which he was about
to reward so generously and in forcing his vocation by a sacrilegious
falsehood the only object of Father dAigrigny might have been to
secure the success of a dark intrigue In acting as he did Gabriel was
not yielding in his view of the question to a sentiment of exaggerated
delicacy He had made this donation freely many years before He would
have looked upon it as infamy now to withdraw it It was hard enough
to be suspected of cowardice for nothing in the world would he have
incurred the least reproach of cupidity

The missionary must have been endowed with a very rare and excellent
nature or this flower of scrupulous probity would have withered
beneath the deleterious and demoralizing influence of his education but
happily as cold sometimes preserves from corruption the icy atmosphere
in which he had passed a portion of his childhood and youth had
benumbed but not vitiated his generous qualities which had indeed
soon revived in the warm air of liberty Father dAigrigny much paler
and more agitated than Gabriel strove to excuse and explain his anxiety
by attributing it to the sorrow he experienced at the rupture of his
dear son with the Order Rodin calm and perfectly master of himself
saw with secret rage the strong emotion of Father dAigrigny which
might have inspired a man less confiding than Gabriel with strange
suspicions Yet notwithstanding his apparent indifference the socius
was perhaps still more ardently impatient than his superior for the
success of this important affair Samuel appeared quite desponding no
other heir but Gabriel having presented himself No doubt the old man
felt a lively sympathy for the young priest but then he was a priest
and with him would finish the line of Rennepont and this immense
fortune accumulated with so much labor would either be again
distributed or employed otherwise than the testator had desired The
different actors in this scene were standing around the table As they
were about to seat themselves at the invitation of the notary Samuel
pointed to the register bound in black shagreen and said I was
ordered sir to deposit here this register It is locked I will
deliver up the key immediately after the reading of the will

This course is in fact directed by the note which accompanies the
will said M Dumesnil as it was deposited in the year 1682 in the
hands of Master Thomas Le Semelier kings counsel and notary of the
Chatelet of Paris then living at No 13 Place Royale

So saying M Dumesnil drew from a portfolio of red morocco a large
parchment envelope grown yellow with time to this envelope was
annexed by a silken thread a note also upon vellum

Gentlemen said the notary if you please to sit down I will read
the subjoined note to regulate the formalities at the opening of the
will

The notary Rodin Father dAigrigny and Gabriel took seats The young
priest having his back turned to the fireplace could not see the two
portraits In spite of the notarys invitation Samuel remained standing
behind the chair of that functionary who read as follows

On the 13th February 1832 my will shall be carried to No 3 in the
Rue SaintFrancois

At ten oclock precisely the door of the Red Room shall be opened
to my heirs who will no doubt have arrived long before at Paris in
anticipation of this day and will have had time to establish their line
of descent

As soon as they are assembled the will shall be read and at the
last stroke of noon the inheritance shall be finally settled in favor
of those of my kindred who according to my recommendation preserved
I hope by tradition in my family during a century and a half shall
present themselves in person and not by agents before twelve oclock
on the 13th of February in the Rue SaintFrancois

Having read these words in a sonorous voice the notary stopped an
instant and resumed in a solemn tone M Gabriel Francois Marie de
Rennepont priest having established by legal documents his descent
on the fathers side and his relationship to the testator and being at
this hour the only one of the descendants of the Rennepont family here
present I open the testament in his presence as it has been ordered

So saying the notary drew from its envelope the will which had been
previously opened by the President of the Tribunal with the formalities
required by law Father dAigrigny leaned forward and resting his elbow
on the table seemed to pant for breath Gabriel prepared himself to
listen with more curiosity than interest Rodin was seated at some
distance from the table with his old hat between his knees in the
bottom of which half hidden by the folds of a shabby blue cotton
handkerchief he had placed his watch The attention of the socius was
divided between the least noise from without and the slow evolution of
the hands of the watch which he followed with his little wrathful eye
as if hastening their progress so great was his impatience for the hour
of noon

The notary unfolding the sheet of parchment read what follows in the
midst of profound attention

Hameau de Villetaneuse

February 13th 1682

I am about to escape by death from the disgrace of the galleys to
which the implacable enemies of my family have caused me to be condemned
as a relapsed heretic

Moreover life is too bitter for me since the death of my son the
victim of a mysterious crime

At nineteen years of agepoor henryand his murderers unknownno
not unknownif I may trust my presentiments

To preserve my fortune for my son I had feigned to abjure the
Protestant faith As long as that beloved boy lived I scrupulously kept
up Catholic appearances The imposture revolted me but the interest of
my son was concerned

When they killed him this deceit became insupportable to me I
was watched accused and condemned as relapsed My property has been
confiscated and I am sentenced to the galleys

Tis a terrible time we live in Misery and servitude sanguinary
despotism and religious intolerance Oh it is sweet to abandon life
sweet to rest and see no more such evils and such sorrows

In a few hours I shall enjoy that rest I shall die Let me think
of those who will surviveor rather of those who will live perhaps in
better times

Out of all my fortune there remains to me a sum of fifty thousand
crowns deposited in a friends hands

I have no longer a son but I have numerous relations exiled in
various parts of Europe This sum of fifty thousand crowns divided
between them would profit each of them very little I have disposed of
it differently

In this I have followed the wise counsels of a man whom I venerate
as the image of God on earth for his intelligence wisdom and goodness
are almost divine

Twice in the course of my life have I seen this man under very fatal
circumstancestwice have I owed him safety once of the soul once of
the body

Alas he might perhaps have saved my poor child but he came too
latetoo late

Before he left me he wished to divert me from the intention of
dyingfor he knew all But his voice was powerless My grief my
regret my discouragement were too much for him

It is strange when he was convinced of my resolution to finish my
days by violence some words of terrible bitterness escaped him making
me believe that he envied memy fatemy death

Is he perhaps condemned to live

Yes he has no doubt condemned himself to be useful to humanity
and yet life is heavy on him for I heard him repeat one day with an
expression of despair and weariness that I have never forgotten Life
life who will deliver me from it

Is life then so very burdensome to him

He is gone His last words have made me look for my departure with
serenity Thanks to him my death shall not be without fruit

Thanks to him these lines written at this moment by a man who in a
few hours will have ceased to live may perhaps be the parents of great
things a century and a half henceyes great and noble things if my
last will is piously followed by my descendants for it is to them that
I here address myself

That they may understand and appreciate this last willwhich I
commend to the care of the unborn who dwell in the future whither I am
hasteningthey must know the persecutors of my family and avenge their
ancestor but by a noble vengeance

My grandfather was a Catholic Induced by perfidious counsels rather
than religious zeal he attached himself though a layman to a Society
whose power has always been terrible and mysteriousthe Society of
Jesus

At these words of the testament Father dAigrigny Rodin and Gabriel
looked involuntarily at each other The notary who had not perceived
this action continued to read

After some years during which he had never ceased to profess the
most absolute devotion to this Society he was suddenly enlightened by
fearful revelations as to the secret ends it pursued and the means it
employed

This was in 1510 a month before the assassination of Henry IV
My grandfather terrified at the secret of which he had become the
unwilling depositary and which was to be fully explained by the death
of the best of kings not only broke with the Society but as if
Catholicism itself had been answerable for the crimes of its members
he abandoned the Romish religion in which he had hitherto lived and
became a Protestant

Undeniable proofs attesting the connivance of two members of the
Company with Ravaillac a connivance also proved in the case of Jean
Chatel the regicide were in my grandfathers possession

This was the first cause of the violent hatred of the Society for our
family Thank Heaven these papers have been placed in safety and if my
last will is executed will be found marked A MC D G in the ebony
casket in the Hall of Mourning in the house in the Rue SaintFrancois

My father was also exposed to these secret persecutions His ruin and
perhaps his death would have been the consequence had it not been for
the intervention of an angelic woman towards whom he felt an almost
religious veneration

The portrait of this woman whom I saw a few years ago as well as
that of the man whom I hold in the greatest reverence were painted
by me from memory and have been placed in the Red Room in the Rue
SaintFrancoisto be gratefully valued I hope by the descendants of
my family

For some moments Gabriel had become more and more attentive to the
reading of this testament He thought within himself by how strange a
coincidence one of his ancestors had two centuries before broken with
the Society of Jesus as he himself had just done and that from this
rupture two centuries old dated also that species of hatred with which
the Society of Jesus had always pursued his family Nor did the young
priest find it less strange that this inheritance transmitted to him
after a lapse of a hundred and fifty years from one of his kindred the
victim of the Society of Jesus should return by a voluntary act to the
coffers of this same society When the notary read the passage relative
to the two portraits Gabriel who like Father dAigrigny sat with his
back towards the pictures turned round to look at them Hardly had the
missionary cast his eyes on the portrait of the woman than he uttered
a loud cry of surprise and almost terror The notary paused in his
reading and looked uneasily at the young priest




CHAPTER XXIV THE LAST STROKE OF NOON

At the cry uttered by Gabriel the notary had stopped reading the
testament and Father dAigrigny hastily drew near the young priest The
latter rose trembling from his seat and gazed with increasing stupor at
the female portrait

Then he said in a low voice as if speaking to himself Good Heaven
is it possible that nature can produce such resemblances Those eyesso
proud and yet so sadthat foreheadthat pale complexionyes all her
features are the sameall of them

My dear son what is the matter said Father dAigrigny as astonished
as Samuel and the notary

Eight months ago replied the missionary in a voice of deep emotion
without once taking his eyes from the picture I was in the power of
the Indians in the heart of the Rocky Mountains They had crucified
and were beginning to scalp me I was on the point of death when Divine
Providence sent me unexpected aidsent me this woman for a deliverer

That woman cried Samuel Father dAigrigny and the notary all
together

Rodin alone appeared completely indifferent to this episode of the
picture His face contracted with angry impatience he bit his nails to
the quick as he contemplated with agony the slow progress of the hands
of his watch

What that woman saved your life resumed Father dAigrigny

Yes this woman replied Gabriel in a still lower and more trembling
voice this womanor rather a woman so much resembling her that if
this picture had not been here for a century and a half I should have
felt sure it was the samenor can I explain to myself that so striking
a resemblance could be the effect of chance Well added he after
a moments silence as he heaved a profound sigh the mysteries of
Nature and the will of God are impenetrable

Gabriel fell back into his chair in the midst of a general silence
which was broken by Father dAigrigny saying It is a case of
extraordinary resemblance that is all my dear son Only the natural
gratitude which you feel towards your benefactress makes you take a
deep interest in this singular coincidence

Rodin bursting with impatience here said to the notary by whose side
he stood It seems to me sir that all this little romance has nothing
to do with the testament

You are right answered the notary resuming his seat but the fact
is so extraordinary and as you say romantic that one cannot help
sharing in this gentlemans astonishment

He pointed to Gabriel who with his elbow resting on the arms of the
chair leaned his forehead upon his hand apparently quite absorbed in
thought The notary continued the reading of the will as follows

Such are the persecutions to which my family has been exposed on the
part of the Society of Jesus

The Society possesses at this hour the whole of my confiscated
property I am about to die May its hatred perish with me and spare my
kindred whose fate at this solemn moment is my last and only thought

This morning I sent for a man of long tried probity Isaac Samuel He
owes his life to me and every day I congratulate myself on having been
able to preserve to the world so honest and excellent a creature

Before the confiscation of my property Isaac Samuel had long managed
it with as much intelligence as uprightness I have entrusted him with
the fifty thousand crowns returned to me by a faithful friend Isaac
Samuel and his descendants after him to whom he will leave this debt
of gratitude will invest the above sum and allow it to accumulate
until the expiration of the hundred and fiftieth year from this time

The amount thus accumulated may become enormous and constitute a
royal fortune if no unfavorable event should occur May my descendants
attend to my wishes as to the division and employment of this immense
sum

In a century and a half there happen so many changes so many
varieties of fortunes such a rise and fall in the condition of the
successive generations of a family that probably a hundred and fifty
years hence my descendants will belong to various classes of society
and thus represent the divers social elements of their time

There may perhaps be among them men of great intelligence great
courage or great virtuelearned men or names illustrious in arts
and arms There may perhaps also be obscure workmen or humble
citizensperhaps also alas great criminals

However this may be my most earnest desire is that my descendants
should combine together and reconstituting one family by a close and
sincere union put into practice the divine words of Christ Love ye
one another

This union would have a salutary tendency for it seems to me that
upon union upon the association of men together must depend the future
happiness of mankind

The Company which so long persecuted my family is one of the most
striking examples of the power of association even when applied to
evil

There is something so fruitful and divine in this principle that it
sometimes forces to good the worst and most dangerous combinations

Thus the missions have thrown a scanty but pure and generous light on
the darkness of this Company of Jesusfounded with the detestable and
impious aim of destroying by a homicidal education all will thought
liberty and intelligence in the people so as to deliver them
trembling superstitious brutal and helpless to the despotism of
kings governed in their turn by confessors belonging to the Society

At this passage of the will there was another strange look exchanged
between Gabriel and Father dAigrigny The notary continued

If a perverse association based upon the degradation of humanity
upon fear and despotism and followed by the maledictions of the people
has survived for centuries and often governed the world by craft and
terrorhow would it be with an association which taking fraternity
and evangelic love for its means had for its end to deliver man
and woman from all degrading slavery to invite to the enjoyment of
terrestrial happiness those who have hitherto known nothing of life but
its sorrows and miseries and to glorify and enrich the labor that feeds
the stateto enlighten those whom ignorance has depravedto favor
the free expansion of all the passions which God in His infinite
wisdom and inexhaustible goodness gave to man as so many powerful
leversto sanctify all the gifts of Heaven love maternity strength
intelligence beauty geniusto make men truly religious and deeply
grateful to their Creator by making them understand the splendors of
Nature and bestowing on them their rightful share in the treasures
which have been poured upon us

Oh if it be Heavens will that in a century and a half the
descendants of my family faithful to the last wishes of a heart that
loved humanity meet in this sacred unionif it be Heavens will
that amongst them be found charitable and passionate souls full of
commiseration for those who suffer and lofty minds ardent for liberty
warm and eloquent natures resolute characters women who unite beauty
and wit with goodnessoh then how fruitful how powerful will be the
harmonious union of all these ideas and influences and forcesof
all these attractions grouped round that princely fortune which
concentrated by association and wisely managed would render
practicable the most admirable Utopias

What a wondrous centre of fertile and generous thoughts What precious
and lifegiving rays would stream incessantly from this focus of
charity emancipation and love What great things might be attempted
what magnificent examples given to the world What a divine mission
What an irresistible tendency towards good might be impressed on the
whole human race by a family thus situated and in possession of such
means

And then such a beneficent association would be able to combat the
fatal conspiracy of which I am the victim and which in a century and a
half may have lost none of its formidable power

So to this work of darkness restraint and despotism which weighs
heavily on the Christian world my family would oppose their work of
light expansion and liberty

The genii of good and evil would stand face to face The struggle
would commence and God would protect the right

And that these immense pecuniary resources which will give so much
power to my family may not be exhausted by the course of years
my heirs following my last will are to place out upon the same
conditions double the sum that I have investedso that a century and
a half later a new source of power and action will be at the disposal
of their descendants What a perpetuity of good

In the ebony cabinet of the Hall of Mourning will be found some
practical suggestions on the subject of this association

Such is my last willor rather such are my last hopes

When I require absolutely that the members of my family should appear
in person in the Rue SaintFrancois on the day of the opening of this
testament it is so that united in that solemn moment they may see and
know each other My words may then perhaps have some effect upon them
and instead of living divided they will combine together It will be
for their own interest and my wishes will thus be accomplished

When I sent a few days ago to those of my family whom exile has
dispersed over Europe a medal on which is engravers the date of the
convocation of my heirs a century and a half from this time I was
forced to keep secret my true motive and only to tell them that my
descendants would find it greatly to their interest to attend this
meeting

I have acted thus because I know the craft and perseverance of the
society of which I have been the victim If they could guess that my
descendants would hereafter have to divide immense sums between them
my family would run the risk of much fraud and malice through the fatal
recommendations handed down from age to age in the Society of Jesus

May these precautions be successful May the wish expressed upon
these medals be faithfully transmitted from generation to generation

If I fix a day and hour in which my inheritance shall irrevocably
fall to those of my descendants who shall appear in the Rue
SaintFrancois on the 13th February in 1832 it is that all delays
must have a term and that my heirs will have been sufficiently informed
years before of the great importance of this meeting

After the reading of my testament the person who shall then be the
trustee of the accumulated funds shall make known their amount so
that with the last stroke of noon they may be divided between my heirs
then and there present

The different apartments of the house shall then be opened to them
They will see in them divers objects well worthy of interest pity and
respectparticularly in the Hall of Mourning

My desire is that the house may not be sold but that it may remain
furnished as it is and serve as a place of meeting for my descendants
if as I hope they attend to my last wishes

If on the contrary they are divided amongst themselvesif instead
of uniting for one of the most generous enterprises that ever signalized
an age they yield to the influence of selfish passionsif they prefer
a sterile individuality to a fruitful associationif in this immense
fortune they see only an opportunity for frivolous dissipation or
sordid interestmay they be accursed by all those whom they might have
loved succored and disfetteredand then let this house be utterly
demolished and destroyed and the papers of which Isaac Samuel
possesses the inventory as well as the two portraits in the Red Room
be burnt by the guardian of the property

I have spoken My duty is accomplished In all this I have followed
the counsels of the man whom I revere and love as the image of God upon
earth

The faithful friend who preserved for me the fifty thousand crowns
the wreck of my fortune knows the use I mean to make of them I could
not refuse his friendship this mark of confidence But I have concealed
from him the name of Isaac Samuelfor to have mentioned it might have
exposed this latter and his descendants to great dangers

In a short time this friend who knows not that my resolution to die
is so near its accomplishment will come hither with my notary Into
their hands after the usual formalities I shall deliver my sealed
testament

Such is my last will I leave its execution to the superintending care
of Providence God will protect the cause of love peace union and
liberty

This mystic testament20 having been freely made by me and written
entirely with my own hand I intend and will its scrupulous execution
both in spirit and the letter

This 13th day of February 1682 at one oclock in the afternoon

 MARIUS DE RENNEPONT

As the notary had proceeded with the reading of the testament Gabriel
was successively agitated by divers painful impressions At first as
we have before said he was struck with the singular fatality which
restored this immense fortune derived from a victim of the Society of
Jesus to the hands of that very association by the renewal of his
deed of gift Then as his charitable and lofty soul began fully to
comprehend the admirable tendency of the association so earnestly
recommended by Marius de Rennepont he reflected with bitter remorse
that in consequence of his act of renunciation and of the absence of
any other heir this great idea would never be realized and a fortune
far more considerable than had even been expected would fall to
the share of an illomened society in whose hands it would become a
terrible means of action At the same time it must be said that the
soul of Gabriel was too pure and noble to feel the slightest personal
regret on hearing the great probable value of the property he had
renounced He rejoiced rather in withdrawing his mind by a touching
contrast from the thought of the wealth he had abandoned to the humble
parsonage where he hoped to pass the remainder of his life in the
practice of most evangelical virtue

These ideas passed confusedly through his brain The sight of that
womans portrait the dark revelations contained in the testament the
grandeur of the views exhibited in this last will of M de Rennepont
all these extraordinary incidents had thrown Gabriel into a sort of
stupor in which he was still plunged when Samuel offered the key
of the register to the notary saying You will find sir in this
register the exact statement of the sums in my possession derived from
the investment and accumulation of the one hundred and fifty thousand
francs entrusted to my grandfather by M Marius de Rennepont

Your grandfather cried Father dAigrigny with the utmost surprise
it is then your family that has always had the management of this
property

Yes sir and in a few minutes my wife will bring hither the casket
which contains the vouchers

And to what sum does this property amount asked Rodin with an air of
the most complete indifference

As M Notary may convince himself by this statement replied Samuel
with perfect frankness and as if he were only talking of the original
one hundred and fifty thousand francs I have in my possession various
current securities to the amount of two hundred and twelve millions one
hundred and seventy

You say sir cried Father dAigrigny without giving Samuel time to
finish for the odd money did not at all interest his reverence

Yes the sum added Rodin in an agitated voice and for the first
time perhaps in his life losing his presence of mind the sumthe
sumthe sum

I say sir resumed the old man that I hold securities for two
hundred and twelve millions one hundred and seventyfive thousand
francs payable to self or beareras you may soon convince yourself M
Notary for here is my wife with the casket

Indeed at this moment Bathsheba entered holding in her arms the cedar
wood chest which contained the securities in question she placed it
upon the table and withdrew after exchanging an affectionate glance
with Samuel When the latter declared the enormous amount of the sum in
hand his words were received with silent stupor All the actors in
this scene except himself believed that they were the sport of some
delusion Father dAigrigny and Rodin had counted upon forty millions
This sum in itself enormous was more than quintupled Gabriel when he
heard the notary read those passages in the testament which spoke of
a princely fortune being quite ignorant of the prodigious effects of
eligible investments had valued the property at some three or
four millions He was therefore struck dumb with amazement at the
exorbitant amount named Notwithstanding his admirable disinterestedness
and scrupulous honor he felt dazzled and giddy at the thought that
all these immense riches might have belonged to himalone The notary
almost as much amazed as Gabriel examined the statement and could
hardly believe his eyes The Jew also remained mute and seemed
painfully absorbed in thought that no other heir made his appearance

In the depth of this profound silence the clock in the next room began
slowly to strike twelve Samuel started and heaved a deep sigh A
few seconds more and the fatal term would be at an end Rodin Father
dAigrigny Gabriel and the notary were all under the influence of
such complete surprise that not one of them even remarked how strange
it was to hear the sound of this clock

Noon cried Rodin as by an involuntary movement he hastily placed
his two hands upon the casket as if to take possession of it

At last cried Father dAigrigny with an expression of joy triumph
transport which it is impossible to describe Then he added as he
threw himself into Gabriels arms whom he embraced warmly Oh my dear
son how the poor will bless you You will be a second Vincent de Paul
You will be canonized I promise you

Let us first thank Providence said Rodin in a grave and solemn
tone as he fell upon his knees let us thank Providence that He has
permitted so much wealth to be employed for His glory

Father dAigrigny having again embraced Gabriel took him by the hand
and said Rodin is right Let us kneel my dear son and render thanks
to Providence

So saying Father dAigrigny knelt down dragging Gabriel with him and
the latter confused and giddy with so many precipitate events yielded
mechanically to the impulse It was the last stroke of twelve when they
all rose together

Then said the notary in a slightly agitated voice for there was
something extraordinary and solemn in this scene

No other heir of M Marius de Rennepont having presented himself
before noon on this day I execute the will of the testator by
declaring in the name of law and justice that M Francois Marie
Gabriel de Rennepont here present is the sole heir and possessor of
all the estate real and personal bequeathed under the said will
all which estate the said Gabriel de Rennepont priest has freely and
voluntarily made over by deed of gift to Frederic Emanuel de Bordeville
Marquis dAigrigny priest who has accepted the same and is
therefore the only legal holder of such property in the room of the
said Gabriel de Rennepont by virtue of the said deed drawn up and
engrossed by me this morning and signed in my presence by the said
Gabriel de Rennepont and Frederic dAigrigny

At this moment the sound of loud voices was heard from the garden
Bathsheba entered hastily and said to her husband with an agitated air
Samuela soldierwho insists

She had not time to finish Dagobert appeared at the door of the Red
Room The soldier was fearfully pale He seemed almost fainting his
left arm was in a sling and he leaned upon Agricola At sight of
Dagobert the pale and flabby eyelids of Rodin were suddenly distended
as if all the blood in his body had flowed towards the head Then the
socius threw himself upon the casket with the haste of ferocious rage
and avidity as if he were resolved to cover it with his body and
defend it at the peril of his life

20 This term is sanctioned by legal usage




CHAPTER XXV THE DEED OF GIFT

Father dAigrigny did not recognize Dagobert and had never seen
Agricola He could not therefore at first explain the kind of angry
alarm exhibited by Rodin But the reverend father understood it all
when he heard Gabriel utter a cry of joy and saw him rush into the
arms of the smith exclaiming My brother my second fatheroh it is
heaven that sends you to me

Having pressed Gabriels hand Dagobert advanced towards Father
dAigrigny with a rapid but unsteady step As he remarked the soldiers
threatening countenance the reverend father strong in his acquired
rights and feeling that since noon he was at home here drew back a
little and said imperiously to the veteran Who are you sirWhat do
you want here

Instead of answering the soldier continued to advance then stopping
just facing Father dAigrigny he looked at him for a second with such
an astounding mixture of curiosity disdain aversion and audacity
that the excolonel of hussars quailed before the pale face and glowing
eye of the veteran The notary and Samuel struck with surprise
remained mute spectators of this scene while Agricola and Gabriel
followed with anxiety Dagoberts least movements As for Rodin he
pretended to be leaning on the casket in order still to cover it with
his body

Surmounting at length the embarrassment caused by the steadfast look
of the soldier Father dAigrigny raised his head and repeated I ask
you sir who you are and what you want

Do you not recognize me said Dagobert hardly able to restrain
himself

No sir

In truth returned the soldier with profound contempt You cast
down your eyes for shame when at Leipsic you fought for the Russians
against the French and when General Simon covered with wounds
answered you renegade that you were when you asked him for his sword
I do not surrender to a traitorand dragged himself along to one of
the Russian grenadiers to whom he yielded up his weapon Well there
was then a wounded soldier by the side of General SimonI am he

In brief sir what do you want said Father dAigrigny hardly able
to control himself

I have come to unmask youyou that are as false and hateful a priest
as Gabriel is admirable and beloved by all

Sir cried the marquis becoming livid with rage and emotion

I tell you that you are infamous resumed the soldier with still
greater force To rob Marshal Simons daughters and Gabriel and
Mdlle de Cardoville of their inheritance you have had recourse to the
most shameful means

What do you say cried Gabriel The daughters of Marshal Simon

Are your relations my dear boy as is also that worthy Mdlle de
Cardoville the benefactress of Agricola Now this priest he added
pointing to Father dAigrigny has had them shut upthe one as mad
in a lunatic asylumthe others in a convent As for you my dear boy I
did not hope to find you here believing that they would have prevented
you like the others from coming hither this morning But thank God
you are here and I arrive in time I should have been sooner but for
my wound I have lost so much blood that I have done nothing but faint
all the morning

Truly cried Gabriel with uneasiness I had not remarked your arm in
a sling What is the wound

At a sign from Agricola Dagobert answered Nothing the consequence of
a fall But here I am to unveil many infamies

It is impossible to paint the curiosity anguish surprise or fear
of the different actors in this scene as they listened to Dagoberts
threatening words But the most overcome was Gabriel His angelic
countenance was distorted his knees trembled under him Struck by the
communication of Dagobert which revealed the existence of other heirs
he was unable to speak for some time at length he cried out in a tone
of despair And it is Ioh God Iwho am the cause of the spoliation
of this family

You brother exclaimed Agricola

Did they not wish to rob you also added Dagobert

The will cried Gabriel with increasing agony gave the property to
those of the heirs that should appear before noon

Well said Dagobert alarmed at the emotion of the young priest

Twelve oclock has struck resumed the latter Of all the family I
alone was present Do you understand it now The term is expired The
heirs have been thrust aside by me

By you said Dagobert stammering with joy By you my brave boy
then all is well

But

All is well resumed Dagobert radiant with delight You will share
with the othersI know you

But all this property I have irrevocably made over to another cried
Gabriel in despair

Made over the property cried Dagobert quite petrified To whom
thento whom

To this gentleman said Gabriel pointing to Father dAigrigny

To him exclaimed Dagobert overwhelmed by the news to himthe
renegadewho has always been the evil genius of this family

But brother cried Agricola did you then know your claim to this
inheritance

No answered the young priest with deep dejection noI only
learned it this morning from Father dAigrigny He told me that he
had only recently been informed of my rights by family papers long ago
found upon me and sent by our mother to her confessor

A sudden light seemed to dawn upon the mind of the smith as he
exclaimed I understand it all now They discovered in these papers
that you would one day have a chance of becoming rich Therefore they
interested themselves about youtherefore they took you into their
college where we could never see youtherefore they deceived you in
your vocation by shameful falsehoods to force you to become a priest
and to lead you to make this deed of gift Oh sir resumed Agricola
turning towards Father dAigrigny with indignation my father is
rightsuch machinations are indeed infamous

During this scene the reverend father and his socius at first alarmed
and shaken in their audacity had by degrees recovered all their
coolness Rodin still leaning upon the casket had said a few words in
a low voice to Father dAigrigny So that when Agricola carried away by
his indignation reproached the latter with his infamous machinations
he bowed his head humbly and answered We are bound to forgive
injuries and offer them to the Lord as a mark of our humility

Dagobert confounded at all he had just heard felt his reason begin to
wander After so much anxiety his strength failed beneath this new and
terrible blow Agricolas just and sensible words in connection with
certain passages of the testament at once enlightened Gabriel as to
the views of Father dAigrigny in taking charge of his education and
leading him to join the Society of Jesus For the first time in his
life Gabriel was able to take in at a glance all the secret springs of
the dark intrigue of which he had been the victim Then indignation
and despair surmounting his natural timidity the missionary with
flashing eye and cheeks inflamed with noble wrath exclaimed as he
addressed Father dAigrigny So father when you placed me in one of
your colleges it was not from any feeling of kindness or commiseration
but only in the hope of bringing me one day to renounce in favor of your
Order my share in this inheritance and it did not even suffice you
to sacrifice me to your cupidity but I must also be rendered the
involuntary instrument of a shameful spoliation If only I were
concernedif you only coveted my claim to all this wealth I should not
complain I am the minister of a religion which honors and sanctifies
poverty I have consented to the donation in your favor and I have not
I could never have any claim upon it But property is concerned which
belong to poor orphans brought from a distant exile by my adopted
father and I will not see them wronged But the benefactress of my
adopted brother is concerned and I will not see her wronged But
the last will of a dying man is concerned who in his ardent love
of humanity bequeathed to his descendants an evangelic missionan
admirable mission of progress love union libertyand I will not
see this mission blighted in its bud No no I tell you that this his
mission shall be accomplished though I have to cancel the donation I
have made

On these words Father dAigrigny and Rodin looked at each other with a
slight shrug of the shoulders At a sign from the socius the reverend
father began to speak with immovable calmness in a slow and sanctified
voice keeping eyes constantly cast down There are many incidents
connected with this inheritance of M de Rennepont which appear very
complicatedmany phantoms which seem un usually menacingand yet
nothing could be really more simple and natural Let us proceed in
regular order Let us put aside all these calumnious imputations we
will return to them afterwards M Gabriel de Rennepontand I humbly
beg him to contradict me if I depart in the least instance from the
exact truthM Gabriel de Rennepont in acknowledgment of the care
formerly bestowed on him by the society to which I have the honor to
belong made over to me as its representative freely and voluntarily
all the property that might come to him one day the value of which was
unknown to him as well as to myself

Father dAigrigny here looked at Gabriel as if appealing to him for the
truth of this statement

It is true said the young priest I made this donation freely

This morning in consequence of a private conversation which I will
not repeatand in this I am certain beforehand of the Abbe Gabriel

True replied Gabriel generously the subject of this conversation
is of little importance

It was then in consequence of this conversation that the Abbe Gabriel
manifested the desire to confirm this donationnot in my favor for I
have little to do with earthly wealthbut in favor of the sacred and
charitable works of which our Company is the trustee I appeal to the
honor of M Gabriel to declare if he have not engaged himself towards
us not only by a solemn oath but by a perfectly legal act executed in
presence of M Dumesnil here present

It is all true answered Gabriel

The deed was prepared by me added the notary

But Gabriel could only give you what belonged to him cried Dagobert
The dear boy never supposed that you were making use of him to rob
other people

Do me the favor sir to allow me to explain myself replied Father
dAigrigny courteously you can afterwards make answer

Dagobert repressed with difficulty his painful impatience The reverend
father continued The Abbe Gabriel has therefore by the double
engagement of an oath and a legal act confirmed his donation Much
more resumed Father dAigrigny when to his great astonishment and
to ours the enormous amount of the inheritance became known the Abbe
Gabriel faithful to his own admirable generosity far from repenting of
his gifts consecrated them once more by a pious movement of gratitude
to Providencefor M Notary will doubtless remember that after
embracing the Abbe Gabriel with transport and telling him that he was
a second Vincent de Paul in charity I took him by the hand and we both
knelt down together to thank heaven for having inspired him with the
thought too offer these immense riches to the Greater Glory of the
Lord

That is true also said Gabriel honestly so long as myself was
concerned though I might be astounded for a moment by the revelation of
so enormous a fortune I did not think for an instant of cancelling the
donation I had freely made

Under these circumstances resumed Father dAigrigny the hour fixed
for the settlement of the inheritance having struck and Abbe Gabriel
being the only heir that presented himself he became necessarily
the only legitimate possessor of this immense wealthenormous no
doubtand charity makes me rejoice that it is enormous for thanks to
it many miseries will be relieved and many tears wiped away But
all on a sudden here comes this gentleman said Father dAigrigny
pointing to Dagobert and under some delusion which I forgive from
the bottom of my soul and which I am sure he will himself regret
accuses me with insults and threats with having carried off I know
not where some persons I know not whom in order to prevent their
being here at the proper time

Yes I accuse you of this infamy cried the soldier exasperated by the
calmness and audacity of the reverend father yesand I will

Once again sir I conjure you to be so good as to let me finish you
can reply afterwards said Father dAigrigny humbly in the softest
and most honeyed accents

Yes I will reply and confound you cried Dagobert

Let him finish father You can speak presently said Agricola

The soldier was silent as Father dAigrigny continued with new
assurance Doubtless if there should really be any other heirs
besides the Abbe Gabriel it is unfortunate for them that they have not
appeared in proper time And if instead of defending the cause of the
poor and needy I had only to look to my own interest I should be far
from availing myself of this advantage due only to chance but as a
trustee for the great family of the poor I am obliged to maintain my
absolute right to this inheritance and I do not doubt that M Notary
will acknowledge the validity of my claim and deliver to me these
securities which are now my legitimate property

My only mission replied the notary in an agitated voice is
faithfully to execute the will of the testator The Abbe Gabriel
de Rennepont alone presented himself within the term fixed by the
testament The deed of gift is in due form I cannot refuse therefore
to deliver to the person named in the deed the amount of the heritage

On these words Samuel hid his face in his hands and heaved a deep
sigh he was obliged to acknowledge the rigorous justice of the notarys
observations

But sir cried Dagobert addressing the man of law this cannot be
You will not allow two poor orphans to be despoiled It is in the name
of their father and mother that I speak to you I give you my honorthe
honor of a soldierthat they took advantage of the weakness of my wife
to carry the daughters of Marshal Simon to a convent and thus prevent
me bringing them here this morning It is so true that I have already
laid my charge before a magistrate

And what answer did you receive said the notary

That my deposition was not sufficient for the law to remove these young
girls from the convent in which they were and that inquiries would be
made

Yes sir added Agricola and it was the same with regard to Mdlle
de Cardoville detained as mad in a lunatic asylum though in the full
enjoyment of her reason Like Marshal Simons daughters she too has a
claim to this inheritance I took the same steps for her as my father
took for Marshal Simons daughters

Well asked the notary

Unfortunately sir answered Agricola they told me as they did my
father that my deposition would not suffice and that they must make
inquiries

At this moment Bathsheba having heard the streetbell ring left the
Red Room at a sign from Samuel The notary resumed addressing Agricola
and his father Far be it from me gentlemen to call in question your
good faith but I cannot to my great regret attach such importance to
your accusations which are not supported by proof as to suspend the
regular legal course According to your own confession gentlemen
the authorities to whom you addressed yourselves did not see fit to
interfere on your depositions and told you they would inquire further
Now really gentlemen I appeal to you how can I in so serious
a matter take upon myself a responsibility which the magistrates
themselves have refused to take

Yes you should do so in the name of justice and honor cried
Dagobert

It may be so sir in your opinion but in my view of the case I
remain faithful to justice and honor by executing with exactness the
last will of the dead For the rest you have no occasion to despair If
the persons whose interests you represent consider themselves injured
they may hereafter have recourse to an action at law against the person
receiving as donee of the Abbe Gabrielbut in the meanwhile it is my
duty to put him in immediate possession of the securities I should be
gravely injured were I to act in any other manner

The notarys observations seemed so reasonable that Samuel Dagobert
and Agricola were quite confounded After a moments thought Gabriel
appeared to take a desperate resolution and said to the notary in a
firm voice

Since under these circumstances the law is powerless to obtain the
right I must adopt sir an extreme course Before doing so I will ask
M lAbbe dAigrigny for the last time if he will content himself with
that portion of the property which falls justly to me on condition that
the rest shall be placed in safe hands till the heirs whose names have
been brought forward shall prove their claim

To this proposition I must answer as I have done already replied
Father dAigrigny it is not I who am concerned but an immense work of
charity I am therefore obliged to refuse the partoffer of the Abbe
Gabriel and to remind him of his engagements of every kind

Then you refuse this arrangement asked Gabriel in an agitated voice

Charity commands me to do so

You refuse itabsolutely

I think of all the good and pious institutions that these treasures
will enable us to establish for the Greater Glory of the Lord and I
have neither the courage nor the desire to make the least concession

Then sir resumed the good priest in a still more agitated manner
since you force me to do it I revoke my donation I only intended to
dispose of my own property and not of that which did not belong to me

Take care M lAbbe said rather dAigrigny I would observe that I
hold in my hand a written formal promise

I know it sir you have a written paper in which I take an oath
never to revoke this donation upon any pretext whatever and on pain of
incurring the aversion and contempt of all honest men Well sir be it
so said Gabriel with deep bitterness I will expose myself to all
the consequences of perjury you may proclaim it everywhere I may be
hated and despised by allbut God will judge me The young priest
dried a tear which trickled from his eye

Oh do not be afraid my dear boy cried Dagobert with reviving hope
All honest men will be on your side

Well done brother said Agricola

M Notary said Rodin in his little sharp voice please to explain
to Abbe Gabriel that he may perjure himself as much as he thinks
fit but that the Civil Code is much less easy to violate than a mere
promise which is onlysacred

Speak sir said Gabriel

Please to inform Abbe Gabriel resumed Rodin that a deed of gift
like that made in favor of Father dAigrigny can only be cancelled for
one of three reasonsis it not so

Yes sir for three reasons said the notary

The first is in case of the birth of a child said Rodin and I
should blush to mention such a contingency to the Abbe Gabriel The
second is the ingratitude of the doneeand the Abbe Gabriel may
be certain of our deep and lasting gratitude The last case is the
nonfulfilment of the wishes of the donor with regard to the employment
of his gifts

Now although the Abbe Gabriel may have suddenly conceived a very bad
opinion of us he will at least give us some time to show that his
gifts have been disposed of according to his wishes and applied to the
Greater Glory of the Lord

Now M Notary added Father dAigrigny it is for you to decide and
say if Abbe Gabriel can revoke the donation he has made

Just as the notary was going to answer Bathsheba reentered the room
followed by two more personages who appeared in the Red Room at a
little distance from each other

CHAPTER XXVI A GOOD GENIUS

The first of the two whose arrival had interrupted the answer of the
notary was Faringhea At sight of this mans forbidding countenance
Samuel approached and said to him Who are you sir

After casting a piercing glance at Rodin who started but soon recovered
his habitual coolness Faringhea replied to Samuel Prince Djalma
arrived lately from India in order to be present here this day as it
was recommended to him by an inscription on a medal which he wore about
his neck

He also cried Gabriel who had been the shipmate of the Indian
Prince from the Azores where the vessel in which he came from
Alexandria had been driven into port he also one of the heirs In
fact the prince told me during the voyage that his mother was of French
origin But doubtless he thought it right to conceal from me the
object of his journey Oh that Indian is a noble and courageous young
man Where is he

The Strangler again looked at Rodin and said laying strong emphasis
upon his words I left the prince yesterday evening He informed me
that although he had a great interest to be here he might possibly
sacrifice that interest to other motives I passed the night in the same
hotel and this morning when I went to call on him they told me he was
already gone out My friendship for him led me to come hither hoping
the information I should be able to give might be of use to the prince

In making no mention of the snare into which he had fallen the day
before in concealing Rodins machinations with regard to Djalma and
in attributing the absence of this latter to a voluntary cause the
Strangler evidently wished to serve the socius trusting that Rodin
would know how to recompense his discretion It is useless to observe
that all this story was impudently false Having succeeded that morning
in escaping from his prison by a prodigious effort of cunning audacity
and skill he had run to the hotel where he had left Djalma there
he had learned that a man and woman of an advanced age and most
respectable appearance calling themselves relations of the young
Indian had asked to see himand that alarmed at the dangerous state
of somnolency in which he seemed to be plunged they had taken him home
in their carriage in order to pay him the necessary attention

It is unfortunate said the notary that this heir also did not
make his appearancebut he has unhappily forfeited his right to the
immense inheritance that is in question

Oh an immense inheritance is in question said Faringhea looking
fixedly at Rodin who prudently turned away his eyes

The second of the two personages we have mentioned entered at this
moment It was the father of Marshal Simon an old man of tall stature
still active and vigorous for his age His hair was white and thin His
countenance rather freshcolored was expressive at once of quickness
mildness and energy

Agricola advanced hastily to meet him You here M Simon he
exclaimed

Yes my boy said the marshals father cordially pressing Agricolas
hand I have just arrived from my journey M Hardy was to have been
here about some matter of inheritance as he supposed but as he will
still be absent from Paris for some time he has charged me

He also an heirM Francis Hardy cried Agricola interrupting the
old workman

But how pale and agitated you are my boy said the marshals father
looking round with astonishment What is the matter

What is the matter cried Dagobert in despair as he approached the
foreman The matter is that they would rob your granddaughters and
that I have brought them from the depths of Siberia only to witness this
shameful deed

Eh cried the old workman trying to recognize the soldiers face you
are then

Dagobert

Youthe generous devoted friend of my son cried the marshals
father pressing the hands of Dagobert in his own with strong emotion
but did you not speak of Simons daughter

Of his daughters for he is more fortunate than he imagines said
Dagobert The poor children are twins

And where are they asked the old man

In a convent

In a convent

Yes by the treachery of this man who keeps them there in order to
disinherit them

What man

The Marquis dAigrigny

My sons mortal enemy cried the old workman as he threw a glance of
aversion at Father dAigrigny whose audacity did not fail him

And that is not all added Agricola M Hardy my worthy and
excellent master has also lost his right to this immense inheritance

What cried Marshal Simons father but M Hardy did not know that
such important interests were concerned He set out hastily to join one
of his friends who was in want of him

At each of these successive revelations Samuel felt his trouble
increase but he could only sigh over it for the will of the testator
was couched unhappily in precise and positive terms

Father dAigrigny impatient to end this scene which caused him cruel
embarrassment in spite of his apparent calmness said to the notary
in a grave and expressive voice It is necessary sir that all
this should have an end If calumny could reach me I would answer
victoriously by the facts that have just come to light Why attribute
to odious conspiracies the absence of the heirs in whose names this
soldier and his son have so uncourteously urged their demands Why
should such absence be less explicable than the young Indians or than
M Hardys who as his confidential man has just told us did not even
know the importance of the interests that called him hither Is it not
probable that the daughters of Marshal Simon and Mdlle de Cardoville
have been prevented from coming here today by some very natural
reasons But once again this has lasted too long I think M Notary
will agree with me that this discovery of new heirs does not at all
affect the question which I had the honor to propose to him just now
namely whether as trustee for the poor to whom Abbe Gabriel made a
free gift of all he possessed I remain notwithstanding his tardy and
illegal opposition the only possessor of this property which I
have promised and which I now again promise in presence of all here
assembled to employ for the Greater Glory of the Lord Please to answer
me plainly M Notary and thus terminate the scene which must needs be
painful to us all

Sir replied the notary in a solemn tone on my soul and conscience
and in the name of law and justiceas a faithful and impartial executor
of the last will of M Marius de Rennepont I declare that by virtue
of the deed of gift of Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont you M lAbbe
dAigrigny are the only possessor of this property which I place at
your immediate disposal that you may employ the same according to the
intention of the donor

These words pronounced with conviction and gravity destroyed the last
vague hopes that the representatives of the heirs might till then have
entertained Samuel became paler than usual and pressed convulsively
the hand of Bathsheba who had drawn near to him Large tears rolled
down the cheeks of the two old people Dagobert and Agricola were
plunged into the deepest dejection Struck with the reasoning of
the notary who refused to give more credence and authority to their
remonstrances than the magistrates had done before him they saw
themselves forced to abandon every hope But Gabriel suffered more than
any one he felt the most terrible remorse in reflecting that by his
blindness he had been the involuntary cause and instrument of this
abominable theft

So when the notary after having examined and verified the amount of
securities contained in the cedar box said to Father dAigrigny
Take possession sir of this casket Gabriel exclaimed with bitter
disappointment and profound despair Alas one would fancy under these
circumstances that an inexorable fatality pursues all those who are
worthy of interest affection or respect Oh my God added the young
priest clasping his hands with fervor Thy sovereign justice will
never permit the triumph of such iniquity

It was as if heaven had listened to the prayer of the missionary Hardly
had he spoken when a strange event took place

Without waiting for the end of Gabriels invocation Rodin profiting by
the decision of the notary had seized the casket in his arms unable
to repress a deep aspiration of joy and triumph At the very moment
when Father dAigrigny and his socius thought themselves at last in safe
possession of the treasure the door of the apartment in which the clock
had been heard striking was suddenly opened

A woman appeared upon the threshold

At sight of her Gabriel uttered a loud cry and remained as if
thunderstruck Samuel and Bathsheba fell on their knees together and
raised their clasped hands The Jew and Jewess felt inexplicable hopes
reviving within them

All the other actors in this scene appeared struck with stupor
RodinRodin himselfrecoiled two steps and replaced the casket on the
table with a trembling hand Though the incident might appear natural
enougha woman appearing on the threshold of a door which she had just
thrown openthere was a pause of deep and solemn silence Every bosom
seemed oppressed and as if struggling for breath All experienced
at sight of this woman surprise mingled with fear and indefinable
anxietyfor this woman was the living original of the portrait which
had been placed in the room a hundred and fifty years ago The same
headdress the same flowing robe the same countenance so full of
poignant and resigned grief She advanced slowly and without appearing
to perceive the deep impression she had caused She approached one of
the pieces of furniture inlaid with brass touched a spring concealed
in the moulding of gilded bronze so that an upper drawer flew open and
taking from it a sealed parchment envelope she walked up to the table
and placed this packet before the notary who hitherto silent and
motionless received it mechanically from her

Then casting upon Gabriel who seemed fascinated by her presence a
long mild melancholy look this woman directed her steps towards the
hall the door of which had remained open As she passed near Samuel and
Bathsheba who were still kneeling she stopped an instant bowed her
fair head towards them and looked at them with tender solicitude Then
giving them her hands to kiss she glided away as slowly as she had
enteredthrowing a last glance upon Gabriel The departure of this
woman seemed to break the spell under which all present had remained for
the last few minutes Gabriel was the first to speak exclaiming in an
agitated voice It is sheagainherein this house

Who brother said Agricola uneasy at the pale and almost wild
looks of the missionary for the smith had not yet remarked the strange
resemblance of the woman to the portrait though he shared in the
general feeling of amazement without being able to explain it to
himself Dagobert and Faringhea were in a similar state of mind

Who is this woman resumed Agricola as he took the hand of Gabriel
which felt damp and icy cold

Look said the young priest Those portraits have been there for more
than a century and a half

He pointed to the paintings before which he was now seated and
Agricola Dagobert and Faringhea raised their eyes to either side of
the fireplace Three exclamations were now heard at once

It is sheit is the same woman cried the smith in amazement and
her portrait has been here for a hundred and fifty years

What do I see cried Dagobert as he gazed at the portrait of the man
The friend and emissary of Marshal Simon Yes it is the same face that
I saw last year in Siberia Oh yes I recognize that wild and sorrowful
airthose black eyebrows which make only one

My eyes do not deceive me muttered Faringhea to himself shuddering
with horror It is the same man with the black mark on his forehead
that we strangled and buried on the banks of the Gangesthe same man
that one of the sons of Bowanee told me in the ruins of Tchandi had
been met by him afterwards at one of the gates of Bombaythe man of the
fatal curse who scatters death upon his passageand his picture has
existed for a hundred and fifty years

And like Dagobert and Agricola the stranger could not withdraw his
eyes from that strange portrait

What a mysterious resemblance thought Father dAigrigny Then as if
struck with a sudden idea he said to Gabriel But this woman is the
same that saved your life in America

It is the same answered Gabriel with emotion and yet she told me
she was going towards the North added the young priest speaking to
himself

But how came she in this house said Father dAigrigny addressing
Samuel Answer me did this woman come in with you or before you

I came in first and alone when this door was first opened since a
century and half said Samuel gravely

Then how can you explain the presence of this woman here said Father
dAigrigny

I do not try to explain it said the Jew I see I believe and now I
hope added he looking at Bathsheba with an indefinable expression

But you ought to explain the presence of this woman said Father
dAigrigny with vague uneasiness Who is she How came she hither

All I know is sir that my father has often told me there are
subterraneous communications between this house and distant parts of the
quarter

Oh then nothing can be clearer said Father dAigrigny it only
remains to be known what this woman intends by coming hither As for
her singular resemblance to this portrait it is one of the freaks of
nature

Rodin had shared in the general emotion at the apparition of this
mysterious woman But when he saw that she had delivered a sealed packet
to the notary the socius instead of thinking of the strangeness of
this unexpected vision was only occupied with a violent desire to quit
the house with the treasure which had just fallen to the Company He
felt a vague anxiety at sight of the envelope with the black seal which
the protectress of Gabriel had delivered to the notary and was still
held mechanically in his hands The socius therefore judging this a
very good opportunity to walk off with the casket during the general
silence and stupor which still continued slightly touched Father
dAigrignys elbow made him a sign of intelligence and tucking the
cedarwood chest under his arm was hastening towards the door

One moment sir said Samuel rising and standing in his path I
request M Notary to examine the envelope that has just been delivered
to him You may then go out

But sir said Rodin trying to force a passage the question is
definitively decided in favor of Father dAigrigny Therefore with your
permission

I tell you sir answered the old man in a loud voice that this
casket shall not leave the house until M Notary has examined the
envelope just delivered to him

These words drew the attention of all Rodin was forced to retrace his
steps Notwithstanding the firmness of his character the Jew shuddered
at the look of implacable hate which Rodin turned upon him at this
moment

Yielding to the wish of Samuel the notary examined the envelope with
attention Good Heaven he cried suddenly what do I seeAh so
much the better

At this exclamation all eyes turned upon the notary Oh read read
sir cried Samuel clasping his hands together My presentiments have
not then deceived me

But sir said Father dAigrigny to the notary for he began to share
in the anxiety of Rodin what is this paper

A codicil answered the notary a codicil which reopens the whole
question

How sir cried Father dAigrigny in a fury as he hastily drew
nearer to the notary reopens the whole question By what right

It is impossible added Rodin We protest against it

Gabriel father listen cried Agricola all is not lost There is
yet hope Do you hear Gabriel There is yet hope

What do you say exclaimed the young priest rising and hardly
believing the words of his adopted brother

Gentlemen said the notary I will read to you the superscription
of this envelope It changes or rather it adjourns the whole of the
testamentary provisions

Gabriel cried Agricola throwing himself on the neck of the
missionary all is adjourned nothing is lost

Listen gentlemen said the notary and he read as follows

This is a Codicil which for reasons herein stated adjourns and
prorogues to the 1st day of June 1832 though without any other change
all the provisions contained in the testament made by me at one oclock
this afternoon The house shall be reclosed and the funds left in the
hands of the same trustee to be distributed to the rightful claimants
on the 1st of June 1832

Villetaneuse this 13th of February 1682 eleven oclock at night
MARIUS DE RENNEPONT

I protest against this codicil as a forgery cried Father dAigrigny
livid with rage and despair

The woman who delivered it to the notary is a suspicious character
added Rodin The codicil has been forged

No sir said the notary severely I have just compared the two
signatures and they are absolutely alike For the restwhat I said
this morning with regard to the absent heirs is now applicable to
youthe law is open you may dispute the authenticity of this codicil
Meanwhile everything will remain suspendedsince the term for the
adjustment of the inheritance is prolonged for three months and a half

When the notary had uttered these last words Rodins nails dripped
blood for the first time his wan lips became red

Oh God Thou hast heard and granted my prayer cried Gabriel
kneeling down with religious fervor and turning his angelic face
towards heaven Thy sovereign justice has not let iniquity triumph

What do you say my brave boy cried Dagobert who in the first
tumult of joy had not exactly understood the meaning of the codicil

All is put off father exclaimed the smith the heirs will have
three months and a half more to make their claim And now that these
people are unmasked added Agricola pointing to Rodin and Father
dAigrigny we have nothing more to fear from them We shall be on
our guard and the orphans Mdlle de Cardoville my worthy master M
Hardy and this young Indian will all recover their own

We must renounce the attempt to paint the delight the transport of
Gabriel and Agricola of Dagobert and Marshal Simons father of Samuel
and Bathsheba Faringhea alone remained in gloomy silence before the
portrait of the man with the blackbarred forehead As for the fury of
Father dAigrigny and Rodin when they saw Samuel retake possession of
the casket we must also renounce any attempt to describe it On the
notarys suggestion who took with him the codicil to have it opened
according to the formalities of the law Samuel agreed that it would be
more prudent to deposit in the Bank of France the securities of immense
value that were now known to be in his possession

While all the generous hearts which had for a moment suffered so much
were overflowing with happiness hope and joy Father dAigrigny and
Rodin quitted the house with rage and death in their souls The reverend
father got into his carriage and said to his servants To SaintDizier
HouseThen worn out and crushed he fell back upon the seat and hid
his face in his hands while he uttered a deep groan Rodin sat next to
him and looked with a mixture of anger and disdain at this so dejected
and brokenspirited man

The coward said he to himself He despairsand yet

A quarter of an hour later the carriage stopped in the Rue de Babylone
in the courtyard of SaintDizier House




CHAPTER XXVII THE FIRST LAST AND THE LAST FIRST

The carriage had travelled rapidly to SaintDizier House During all
the way Rodin remained mute contenting himself with observing Father
dAigrigny and listening to him as he poured forth his grief and fury
in a long monologue interrupted by exclamations lamentations and
bursts of rage directed against the strokes of that inexorable destiny
which had ruined in a moment the best founded hopes When the carriage
entered the courtyard and stopped before the portico the princesss
face could be seen through one of the windows half hidden by the folds
of a curtain in her burning anxiety she came to see if it was really
Father dAigrigny who arrived at the house Still more in defiance
of all ordinary rules this great lady generally so scrupulous as to
appearances hurried from her apartment and descended several steps
of the staircase to meet Father dAigrigny who was coming up with
a dejected air At sight of the livid and agitated countenance of the
reverend father the princess stopped suddenly and grew pale She
suspected that all was lost A look rapidly exchanged with her old lover
left her no doubt of the issue she so much feared Rodin humbly followed
the reverend father and both preceded by the princess entered the
room The door once closed the princess addressing Father dAigrigny
exclaimed with unspeakable anguish What has happened

Instead of answering this question the reverend father his eyes
sparkling with rage his lips white his features contracted looked
fixedly at the princess and said to her Do you know the amount of
this inheritance that we estimated at forty millions

I understand cried the princess we have been deceived The
inheritance amounts to nothing and all you have dare has been in vain

Yes it has indeed been in vain answered the reverend father
grinding his teeth with rage it was no question of forty millions but
of two hundred and twelve millions

Two hundred and twelve millions repeated the princess in amazement
as she drew back a step It is impossible

I tell you I saw the vouchers which were examined by the notary

Two hundred and twelve millions resumed the princess with deep
dejection It is an immense and sovereign powerand you have
renouncedyou have not struggled for it by every possible means and
till the last moment

Madame I have done all that I couldnotwithstanding the treachery
of Gabriel who this very morning declared that he renounced us and
separated from the Society

Ungrateful said the princess unaffectedly

The deed of gift which I had the precaution to have prepared by the
notary was in such good legal form that in spite of the objections of
that accursed soldier and his son the notary had put me in possession
of the treasure

Two hundred and twelve millions repeated the princess clasping her
hands Verily it is like a dream

Yes replied Father dAigrigny bitterly for us this possession is
indeed a dream for a codicil has been discovered which puts off for
three months and a half all the testamentary provisions Now that our
very precautions have roused the suspicion of all these heirsnow that
they know the enormous amount at stakethey will be upon their guard
and all is lost

But who is the wretch that produced this codicil

A woman

What woman

Some wandering creature that Gabriel says he met in America where she
saved his life

And how could this woman be therehow could she know the existence of
this codicil

I think it was all arranged with a miserable Jew the guardian of the
house whose family has had charge of the funds for three generations
he had no doubt some secret instructions in case he suspected the
detention of any of the heirs for this Marius de Rennepont had foreseen
that our Company would keep their eyes upon his race

But can you not dispute the validity of this codicil

What go to law in these timeslitigate about a willincur the
certainty of a thousand clamors with no security for successIt is
bad enough that even this should get wind Alas it is terrible So
near the goal after so much care and trouble An affair that had been
followed up with so much perseverance during a century and a half

Two hundred and twelve millions said the princess The Order would
have had no need to look for establishments in foreign countries with
such resources it would have been able to impose itself upon France

Yes resumed Father dAigrigny with bitterness by means of
education we might have possessed ourselves of the rising generation
The power is altogether incalculable Then stamping with his foot he
resumed I tell you that it is enough to drive one mad with rage an
affair so wisely ably patiently conducted

Is there no hope

Only that Gabriel may not revoke his donation in as far as concerns
himself That alone would be a considerable sumnot less than thirty
millions

It is enormousit is almost what you hoped said the princess then
why despair

Because it is evident that Gabriel will dispute this donation However
legal it may be he will find means to annul it now that he is free
informed as to our designs and surrounded by his adopted family I tell
you that all is lost There is no hope left I think it will be even
prudent to write to Rome to obtain permission to leave Paris for a
while This town is odious to me

Oh yes I see that no hope is leftsince you my friend have decided
almost to fly

Father dAigrigny was completely discouraged and broken down this
terrible blow had destroyed all life and energy within him He threw
himself back in an armchair quite overcome During the preceding
dialogue Rodin was standing humbly near the door with his old hat in
his hand Two or three times at certain passages in the conversation
between Father dAigrigny and the princess the cadaverous face of the
socius whose wrath appeared to be concentrated was slightly flushed
and his flappy eyelids were tinged with red as if the blood mounted in
consequence of an interior struggle but immediately after his dull
countenance resumed its pallid blue

I must write instantly to Rome to announce this defeat which has
become an event of the first importance because it overthrows immense
hopes said Father dAigrigny much depressed

The reverend father had remained seated pointing to a table he said to
Rodin with an abrupt and haughty air

Write

The socius placed his hat on the ground answered with a respectful
bow the command and with stooping head and slanting walk went to
seat himself on a chair that stood before a desk Then taking pen
and paper he waited silent and motionless for the dictation of his
superior

With your permission princess said Father dAigrigny to Madame de
SaintDizier The latter answered by an impatient wave of the hand as
if she reproached him for the formal demand at such a time The reverend
father bowed and dictated these words in a hoarse and hollow voice
All our hopes which of late had become almost certainties have been
suddenly defeated The affair of the Rennepont inheritance in spite
of all the care and skill employed upon it has completely and
finally failed At the point to which matters had been brought it is
unfortunately worse than a failure it is a most disastrous event for
the Society which was clearly entitled to this property fraudulently
withdrawn from a confiscation made in our favor My conscience at least
bears witness that to the last moment I did all that was possible
to defend and secure our rights But I repeat we must consider this
important affair as lost absolutely and forever and think no more about
it

Thus dictating Father dAigrignys back was turned towards Rodin At a
sudden movement made by the socius in rising and throwing his pen upon
the table instead of continuing to write the reverend father turned
round and looking at Rodin with profound astonishment said to him
Well what are you doing

It is time to end thisthe man is mad said Rodin to himself as he
advanced slowly towards the fireplace

What you quit your placeyou cease writing said the reverend
father in amazement Then addressing the princess who shared in his
astonishment he added as he glanced contemptuously at the socius He
is losing his senses

Forgive him replied Mme de SaintDizier it is no doubt the
emotion caused by the ruin of this affair

Thank the princess return to your place and continue to write said
Father dAigrigny to Rodin in a tone of disdainful compassion as with
imperious finger he pointed to the table

The socius perfectly indifferent to this new order approached the
fireplace drew himself up to his full height as he turned his arched
back planted himself firmly on his legs stamped on the carpet with the
heel of his clumsy greasy shoes crossed his hands beneath the flaps of
his old spotted coat and lifting his head looked fixedly at
Father dAigrigny The socius had not spoken a word but his hideous
countenance now flushed suddenly revealed such a sense of his
superiority and such sovereign contempt for Father dAigrigny mingled
with so calm and serene a daring that the reverend father and the
princess were quite confounded by it They felt themselves overawed by
this little old man so sordid and so ugly Father dAigrigny knew too
well the customs of the Company to believe his humble secretary capable
of assuming so suddenly these airs of transcendent superiority without
a motive or rather without a positive right Late too late the
reverend father perceived that this subordinate agent might be partly
a spy partly an experienced assistant who according to the
constitutions of the Order had the power and mission to depose and
provisionally replace in certain urgent cases the incapable person
over whom he was stationed as a guard The reverend father was not
deceived From the general to the provincials and to the rectors of
the colleges all the superior members of the Order have stationed
near them often without their knowledge and in apparently the lowest
capacities men able to assume their functions at any given moment and
who with this view constantly keep up a direct correspondence with
Rome

From the moment Rodin had assumed this position the manners of Father
dAigrigny generally so haughty underwent a change Though it cost him
a good deal he said with hesitation mingled with deference You have
no doubt the right to command mewho hitherto have commanded Rodin
without answering drew from his wellrubbed and greasy pocketbook a
slip of paper stamped upon both sides on which were written several
lines in Latin When he had read it Father dAigrigny pressed this
paper respectfully even religiously to his lips then returned it to
Rodin with a low bow When he again raised his head he was purple with
shame and vexation Notwithstanding his habits of passive obedience
and immutable respect for the will of the Order he felt a bitter and
violent rage at seeing himself thus abruptly deposed from power That
was not all Though for a long time past all relations in gallantry
had ceased between him and Mme de SaintDizier the latter was not the
less a woman and for him to suffer this humiliation in presence of a
woman was undoubtedly cruel as notwithstanding his entrance into the
Order he had not wholly laid aside the character of man of the world
Moreover the princess instead of appearing hurt and offended by this
sudden transformation of the superior into a subaltern and of the
subaltern into a superior looked at Rodin with a sort of curiosity
mingled with interest As a womanas a woman intensely ambitious
seeking to connect herself with every powerful influencethe princess
loved this strange species of contrast She found it curious and
interesting to see this man almost in rags mean in appearance and
ignobly ugly and but lately the most humble of subordinates look down
from the height of his superior intelligence upon the nobleman by
birth distinguished for the elegance of his manners and just before so
considerable a personage in the Society From that moment as the more
important personage of the two Rodin completely took the place of
Father dAigrigny in the princesss mind The first pang of humiliation
over the reverend father though his pride bled inwardly applied all
his knowledge of the world to behave with redoubled courtesy towards
Rodin who had become his superior by this abrupt change of fortune But
the exsocius incapable of appreciating or rather of acknowledging
such delicate shades of manner established himself at once firmly
imperiously brutally in his new position not from any reaction of
offended pride but from a consciousness of what he was really worth
A long acquaintance with Father dAigrigny had revealed to him the
inferiority of the latter

You threw away your pen said Father dAigrigny to Rodin with extreme
deference while I was dictating a note for Rome Will you do me the
favor to tell me how I have acted wrong

Directly replied Rodin in his sharp cutting voice For a long time
this affair appeared to me above your strength but I abstained from
interfering And yet what mistakes what poverty of invention what
coarseness in the means employed to bring it to bear

I can hardly understand your reproaches answered Father dAigrigny
mildly though a secret bitterness made its way through his apparent
submission Was not the success certain had it not been for this
codicil Did you not yourself assist in the measures that you now
blame

You commanded then and it was my duty to obey Besides you were just
on the point of succeedingnot because of the means you had takenbut
in spite of those means with all their awkward and revolting
brutality

Siryou are severe said Father dAigrigny

I am just One has to be prodigiously clever truly to shut up any one
in a room and then lock the door And yet what else have you done The
daughters of General Simonimprisoned at Leipsic shut up in a
convent at Paris Adrienne de Cardovilleplaced in confinement
Sleepinbuffput in prison Djalmaquieted by a narcotic One only
ingenious method and a thousand times safer because it acted morally
not materially was employed to remove M Hardy As for your other
proceedingsthey were all bad uncertain dangerous Why Because they
were violent and violence provokes violence Then it is no longer a
struggle of keen skillful persevering men seeing through the darkness
in which they walk but a match of fisticuffs in broad day Though we
should be always in action we should always shrink from view and yet
you could find no better plan than to draw universal attention to us
by proceedings at once open and deplorably notorious To make them more
secret you call in the guard the commissary of police the jailers
for your accomplices It is pitiable sir nothing but the most
brilliant success could cover such wretched folly and this success has
been wanting

Sir said Father dAigrigny deeply hurt for the Princess de Saint
Dizier unable to conceal the sort of admiration caused in her by the
plain decisive words of Rodin looked at her old lover with an air
that seemed to say He is rightsir you are more than severe in
your judgment and notwithstanding the deference I owe to you I must
observe that I am not accustomed

There are many other things to which you are not accustomed said
Rodin harshly interrupting the reverend father but you will accustom
yourself to them You have hitherto had a false idea of your own value
There is the old leaven of the soldier and the worlding fermenting
within you which deprives your reason of the coolness lucidity and
penetration that it ought to possess You have been a fine military
officer brisk and gay foremost in wars and festivals with pleasures
and women These things have half worn you out You will never be
anything but a subaltern you have been thoroughly tested You will
always want that vigor and concentration of mind which governs men and
events That vigor and concentration of mind I haveand do you know
why It is because solely devoted to the service of the Company I have
always been ugly dirty unloved unlovingI have all my manhood about
me

In pronouncing these words full of cynical pride Rodin was truly
fearful The princess de SaintDizier thought him almost handsome by his
energy and audacity

Father dAigrigny feeling himself overawed invincibly and inexorably
by this diabolical being made a last effort to resist and exclaimed
Oh sir these boastings are no proofs of valor and power We must see
you at work

Yes replied Rodin coldly do you know at what work Rodin was fond
of this interrogative mode of expression Why at the work that you so
basely abandon

What cried the Princess de SaintDizier for Father dAigrigny
stupefied at Rodins audacity was unable to utter a word

I say resumed Rodin slowly that I undertake to bring to a good
issue this affair of the Rennepont inheritance which appears to you so
desperate

You cried Father dAigrigny You I

But they have unmasked our maneuvers

So much the better we shall be obliged to invent others

But they will suspect us in everything

So much the better the success that is difficult is the most certain

What do you hope to make Gabriel consent not to revoke his donation
which is perhaps illegal

I mean to bring in to the coffers of the Company the whole of the two
hundred and twelve millions of which they wish to cheat us Is that
clear

It is clearbut impossible

And I tell you that it is and must be possible Do you not understand
shortsighted as you are cried Rodin animated to such a degree that
his cadaverous face became slightly flushed do you not understand that
it is no longer in our choice to hesitate Either these two hundred
and twelve millions must be oursand then the reestablishment of our
sovereign influence in France is surefor in these venal times with
such a sum at command you may bribe or overthrow a government or light
up the flame of civil war and restore legitimacy which is our natural
ally and owing all to us would give us all in return

That is clear cried the princess clasping her hands in admiration

If on the contrary resumed Rodin these two hundred and twelve
millions fall into the hands of the family of the Renneponts it will
be our ruin and our destruction We shall create a stock of bitter and
implacable enemies Have you not heard the execrable designs of that
Rennepont with regard to the association he recommends and which by
an accursed fatality his race are just in a condition to realize Think
of the forces that would rally round these millions There would be
Marshal Simon acting in the name of his daughtersthat is the man of
the people become a duke without being the vainer for it which secures
his influence with the mob because military spirit and Bonapartism
still represent in the eyes of the French populace the traditions of
national honor and glory There would be Francis Hardy the liberal
independent enlightened citizen the type of the great manufacturer
the friend of progress the benefactor of his workmen There would be
Gabrielthe good priest as they saythe apostle of the primitive
gospel the representative of the democracy of the church of the poor
country curate as opposed to the rich bishop the tiller of the vine as
opposed to him who sits in the shade of it the propagator of all
the ideas of fraternity emancipation progressto use their own
jargonand that not in the name of revolutionary and incendiary
politics but in the name of a religion of charity love and peaceto
speak as they speak There too would be Adrienne de Cardoville the
type of elegance grace and beauty the priestess of the senses which
she deifies by refining and cultivating them I need not tell you of
her wit and audacity you know them but too well No one could be more
dangerous to us than this creature a patrician in blood a plebeian in
heart a poet in imagination Then too there would be Prince Djalma
chivalrous bold ready for adventure knowing nothing of civilized
life implacable in his hate as in his affection a terrible instrument
for whoever can make use of him In this detestable family even such
a wretch as Sleepinbuff who in himself is of no value raised and
purified by the contact of these generous and far from narrow natures
as they call them might represent the working class and take a large
share in the influence of that association Now do you not think that if
all these people already exasperated against us because as they say
we have wished to rob them should follow the detestable counsels of
this Rennepontshould unite their forces around this immense fortune
which would strengthen them a hundredfolddo you not think that if
they declare a deadly war against us they will be the most dangerous
enemies that we have ever had I tell you that the Company has never
been in such serious peril yes it is now a question of life and
death We must no longer defend ourselves but lead the attack so as
to annihilate this accursed race of Rennepont and obtain possession of
these millions

At this picture drawn by Rodin with a feverish animation which had
only the more influence from its unexpectedness the princess and Father
dAigrigny looked at each other in confusion

I confess said the reverend father to Rodin I had not considered
all the dangerous consequences of this association recommended by M de
Rennepont I believe that the heir from the characters we know them to
be possessed of would wish to realize this Utopia The peril is great
and pressing what is to be done

What sir You have to act upon ignorant heroic enthusiastic natures
like Djalmassensual and eccentric characters like Adrienne de
Cardovillessimple and ingenuous minds like Rose and Blanche
Simonshonest and frank dispositions like Francis Hardysangelic and
pure souls like Gabrielsbrutal and stupid instincts like Jacquesand
can you ask What is to be done

In truth I do not understand you said Father dAigrigny

I believe it Your past conduct shows as much replied Rodin
contemptuously You have had recourse to the lowest and most mechanical
contrivances instead of acting upon the noble and generous passions
which once united would constitute so formidable a bond but which
now divided and isolated are open to every surprise every seduction
every attack Do you at length understand me Not yet added Rodin
shrugging his shoulders Answer medo people die of despair

Yes

May not the gratitude of successful love reach the last limits of
insane generosity

Yes

May there not be such horrible deceptions that suicide is the only
refuge from frightful realities

Yes

May not the excess of sensuality lead to the grave by a slow and
voluptuous agony

Yes

Are there not in life such terrible circumstances that the most
worldly the firmest the most impious characters throw themselves
blindly overwhelmed with despair into the arms of religion and
abandon all earthly greatness for sackcloth and prayers and solitude

Yes

Are there not a thousand occasions in which the reaction of the
passions works the most extraordinary changes and brings about the most
tragic catastrophes in the life of man and woman

No doubt

Well then why ask me What is to be done What would you say for
example if before three months are over the most dangerous members of
this family of the Renneponts should come to implore upon their knees
admission to that very Society which they now hold in horror and from
which Gabriel has just separated

Such a conversion is impossible cried Father dAigrigny

Impossible What were you sir fifteen years ago said Rodin An
impious and debauched man of the world And yet you came to us and your
wealth became ours What we have conquered princes kings popes we
have absorbed and extinguished in our unity magnificent intelligences
which from afar shone with too dazzling a light we have all but
governed two worlds we have perpetuated our Society full of life
rich and formidable even to this day through all the hate and all the
persecutions that have assailed us and yet we shall not be able to
get the better of a single family which threatens our Company and has
despoiled us of a large fortune What we are not skillful enough to
obtain this result without having recourse to awkward and dangerous
violence You do not know then the immense field that is thrown
open by the mutually destructive power of human passions skillfully
combined opposed restrained excitedparticularly added Rodin
with a strange smile when thanks to a powerful ally these passions
are sure to be redoubled in ardor and energy

What ally asked Father dAigrigny who as well as the Princess de
SaintDizier felt a sort of admiration mixed with terror

Yes resumed Rodin without answering the reverend father this
formidable ally who comes to our assistance may bring about the most
astonishing transformationsmake the coward brave and the impious
credulous and the gentle ferocious

But this ally cried the Princess oppressed with a vague sense of
fear This great and formidable allywho is he

If he comes resumed Rodin still impassible the youngest and most
vigorous every moment in danger of death will have no advantage over
the sick man at his last gasp

But who is this ally exclaimed Father dAigrigny more and more
alarmed for as the picture became darker Rodins face become more
cadaverous

This ally who can decimate a population may carry away with him in
the shroud that he drags at his heels the whole of an accursed race
but even he must respect the life of that great intangible body which
does not perish with the death of its membersfor the spirit of the
Society of Jesus is immortal

And this ally

Oh this ally resumed Rodin who advances with slow steps and whose
terrible coming is announced by mournful presentiments

Is

The Cholera

These words pronounced by Rodin in an abrupt voice made the Princess
and Father dAigrigny grow pale and tremble Rodins look was gloomy and
chilling like a spectres For some moments the silence of the
tomb reigned in the saloon Rodin was the first to break it Still
impassible he pointed with imperious gesture to the table where a few
minutes before he had himself been humbly seated and said in a sharp
voice to Father dAigrigny Write

The reverend father started at first with surprise then remembering
that from a superior he had become an inferior he rose bowed lowly to
Rodin as he passed before him seated himself at the table took the
pen and said I am ready

Rodin dictated and the reverend Father wrote as follows By the
mismanagement of the Reverend Father dAigrigny the affair of the
inheritance of the Rennepont family has been seriously compromised
The sum amounts to two hundred and twelve millions Notwithstanding
the check we have received we believe we may safely promise to prevent
these Renneponts from injuring the Society and to restore the two
hundred and twelve millions to their legitimate possessors We only ask
for the most complete and extensive powers

A quarter of an hour after this scene Rodin left Saint Dizier House
brushing with his sleeve the old greasy hat I which he had pulled off
to return the salute of the porter by a very low bow




CHAPTER XXVIII THE STRANGER

The following scene took place on the morrow of the day in which
Father dAigrigny had been so rudely degraded by Rodin to the subaltern
position formerly occupied by the socius

It is well known that the Rue Clovis is one of the most solitary streets
in the Montagne St Genevieve district At the epoch of this narrative
the house No 4 in this street was composed of one principal building
through which ran a dark passage leading to a little gloomy court at
the end of which was a second building in a singularly miserable and
dilapidated condition On the groundfloor in front of the house was a
halfsubterraneous shop in which was sold charcoal fagots vegetables
and milk Nine oclock in the morning had just struck The mistress of
the shop one Mother Arsene an old woman of a mild sickly countenance
clad in a brown stuff dress with a red bandanna round her head was
mounted on the top step of the stairs which led down to her door and
was employed in setting out her goodsthat is on one side of her
door she placed a tin milkcan and on the other some bunches of stale
vegetables flanked with yellowed cabbages At the bottom of the steps
in the shadowy depths of the cellar one could see the light of the
burning charcoal in a little stove This shop situated at the side of
the passage served as a porters lodge and the old woman acted as
portress On a sudden a pretty little creature coming from the house
entered lightly and merrily the shop This young girl was RosePompon
the intimate friend of the Bacchanal QueenRosePompon a widow for
the moment whose bacchanalian cicisbeo was Ninny Moulin the orthodox
scapegrace who on occasion after drinking his fill could transform
himself into Jacques Dumoulin the religious writer and pass gayly from
dishevelled dances to ultramontane polemics from Stormblown Tulips to
Catholic pamphlets

RosePompon had just quitted her bed as appeared by the negligence of
her strange morning costume no doubt for want of any other headdress
on her beautiful light hair smooth and wellcombed was stuck jauntily
a foragingcap borrowed from her masquerading costume Nothing could
be more sprightly than that face seventeen years old rosy fresh
dimpled and brilliantly lighted up by a pair of gay sparkling blue
eyes Rose Pompon was so closely enveloped from the neck to the feet
in a red and green plaid cloak rather faded that one could guess the
cause of her modest embarrassment Her naked feet so white that one
could not tell if she wore stockings or not were slipped into little
morocco shoes with plated buckles It was easy to perceive that her
cloak concealed some article which she held in her hand

Goodday RosePompon said Mother Arsene with a kindly air you are
early this morning Had you no dance last night

Dont talk of it Mother Arsene I had no heart to dance Poor
Cephysethe Bacchanal Queenhas done nothing but cry all night She
cannot console herself that her lover should be in prison

Now look here my girl said the old woman I must speak to you
about your friend Cephyse You wont be angry

Am I ever angry said RosePompon shrugging her shoulders

Dont you think that M Philemon will scold me on his return

Scold you what for

Because of his rooms that you occupy

Why Mother Arsene did not Philemon tell you that in his absence I
was to be as much mistress of his two rooms as I am of himself

I do not speak of you but of your friend Cephyse whom you have also
brought to occupy M Philemons lodgings

And where would she have gone without me my good Mother Arsene Since
her lover was arrested she has not dared to return home because she
owes ever so many quarters Seeing her troubles I said to her Come
lodge at Philemons When he returns we must find another place for
you

Well little loveyif you only assure me that M Philemon will not be
angry

Angry for what That we spoil his things A fine set of things he has
to spoil I broke his last cup yesterdayand am forced to fetch the
milk in this comic concern

So saying laughing with all her might RosePompon drew her pretty
little white arm from under her cloak and presented to Mother Arsene
one of those champagne glasses of colossal capacity which hold about a
bottle

Oh dear said the greengrocer in amazement it is like a glass
trumpet

It is Philemons grand galaglass which they gave him when he took his
degrees in boating said RosePompon gravely

And to think you must put your milk in itI am really ashamed said
Mother Arsene

So am I If I were to meet any one on the stairs holding this glass in
my hand like a Roman candlestick I should burst out laughing and
break the last remnant of Philemons bazaar and he would give me his
malediction

There is no danger that you will meet any one The firstfloor is gone
out and the second gets up very late

Talking of lodgers said RosePompon is there not a room to let
on the secondfloor in the rear house It might do for Cephyse when
Philemon comes back

Yes there is a little closet in the roofjust over the two rooms of
the mysterious old fellow said Mother Arsene

Oh yes Father Charlemagne Have you found out anything more about
him

Dear me no my girl only that he came this morning at break of day
and knocked at my shutters Have you received a letter for me my good
lady said hefor he is always so polite the dear manNo sir
said IWell then pray dont disturb yourself my good lady said
he I will call again And so he went away

Does he never sleep in the house

Never No doubt he lodges somewhere elsebut he passes some hours
here once every four or five days

And always comes alone

Always

Are you quite sure Does he never manage to slip in some little puss
of a woman Take care or Philemon will give you notice to quit said
RosePompon with an air of mockmodesty

M Charlemagne with a woman Oh poor dear man said the greengrocer
raising her hands to heaven if you saw him with his greasy hat his
old gray coat his patched umbrella and his simple face he looks more
like a saint than anything else

But then Mother Arsene what does the saint do here all alone for
hours in that hole at the bottom of the court where one can hardly see
at noonday

Thats what I ask myself my dovey what can he be doing It cant be
that he comes to look at his furniture for he has nothing but a flock
bed a table a stove a chair and an old trunk

Somewhat in the style of Philemons establishment said RosePompon

Well notwithstanding that Rosey he is as much afraid that any one
should come into his room as if we were all thieves and his furniture
was made of massy gold He has had a patent lock put on the door at his
own expense he never leaves me his key and he lights his fire himself
rather than let anybody into his room

And you say he is old

Yes fifty or sixty

And ugly

Just fancy little vipers eyes looking as if they had been bored with
a gimlet in a face as pale as deathso pale that the lips are white
Thats for his appearance As for his character the good old mans so
politehe pulls off his hat so often and makes you such low bows
that it is quite embarrassing

But to come back to the point resumed RosePompon what can he
do all alone in those two rooms If Cephyse should take the closet on
Philemons return we may amuse ourselves by finding out something about
it How much do they want for the little room

Why it is in such bad condition that I think the landlord would let
it go for fifty or fiftyfive francs ayear for there is no room for a
stove and the only light comes through a small pane in the roof

Poor Cephyse said Rose sighing and shaking her head sorrowfully
After having amused herself so well and flung away so much money with
Jacques Rennepont to live in such a place and support herself by hard
work She must have courage

Why indeed there is a great difference between that closet and the
coachandfour in which Cephyse came to fetch you the other day with
all the fine masks that looked so gayparticularly the fat man in
the silver paper helmet with the plume and the top boots What a jolly
fellow

Yes Ninny Moulin There is no one like him to dance the forbidden
fruit You should see him with Cephyse the Bacchanal Queen Poor
laughing noisy thingthe only noise she makes now is crying

Oh these young peoplethese young people said the greengrocer

Easy Mother Arsene you were young once

I hardly know I have always thought myself much the same as I am now

And your lovers Mother Arsene

Lovers Oh yes I was too ugly for thatand too well taken care of

Your mother looked after you then

No my girl but I was harnessed

Harnessed cried RosePompon in amazement interrupting the dealer

Yesharnessed to a watercart along with my brother So you see
when we had drawn like a pair of horses for eight or ten hours a day I
had no heart to think of nonsense

Poor Mother Arsene what a hard life said RosePompon with interest

In the winter when it froze it was hard enough I and my brother were
obliged to be roughshod for fear of slipping

What a trade for a woman It breaks ones heart And they forbid people
to harness dogs added RosePompon sententiously21

Why tis true resumed Mother Arsene Animals are sometimes better
off than people But what would you have One must live you know As
you make your bed you must lie It was hard enough and I got a disease
of the lungs by itwhich was not my fault The strap with which I
was harnessed pressed so hard against my chest that I could scarcely
breathe so I left the trade and took to a shop which is just to tell
you that if I had had a pretty face and opportunity I might have done
like so many other young people who begin with laughter and finish

With a laugh tother side of the mouthyou would say it is true
Mother Arsene But you see every one has not the courage to go into
harness in order to remain virtuous A body says to herself you must
have some amusement while you are young and prettyyou will not always
be seventeen years oldand thenand thenthe world will end or you
will get married

But perhaps it would have been better to begin by that

Yes but one is too stupid one does not know how to catch the men or
to frighten them One is simple confiding and they only laugh at us
Why Mother Arsene I am myself an example that would make you shudder
but tis quite enough to have had ones sorrows without fretting ones
self at the remembrance

What my beauty you so young and gay have had sorrows

Ah Mother Arsene I believe you At fifteen and a half I began to cry
and never left off till I was sixteen That was enough I think

They deceived you mademoiselle

They did worse They treated me as they have treated many a poor girl
who had no more wish to go wrong than I had My story is not a three
volume one My father and mother are peasants near SaintValery but
so poorso poor that having five children to provide for they were
obliged to send me at eight years old to my aunt who was a charwoman
here in Paris The good woman took me out of charity and very kind it
was of her for I earned but little At eleven years of age she sent me
to work in one of the factories of the Faubourg SaintAntoine I dont
wish to speak ill of the masters of these factories but what do they
care if little boys and girls are mixed up pellmell with young men and
women of eighteen to twenty Now you see there as everywhere some are
no better than they should be they are not particular in word or deed
and I ask you what art example for the children who hear and see more
than you think for Then what happens They get accustomed as they grow
older to hear and see things that afterwards will not shock them at
all

What you say there is true RosePompon Poor children who takes any
trouble about themnot their father or mother for they are at their
daily work

Yes yes Mother Arsene it is all very well it is easy to cry down a
young girl that has gone wrong but if they knew all the ins and
outs they would perhaps pity rather than blame her To come back to
myselfat fifteen years old I was tolerably pretty One day I had
something to ask of the head clerk I went to him in his private room
He told me he would grant what I wanted and even take me under his
patronage if I would listen to him and he began by trying to kiss me
I resisted Then he said to meYou refuse my offer You shall have no
more work I discharge you from the factory

Oh the wicked man said Mother Arsene

I went home all in tears and my poor aunt encouraged me not to yield
and she would try to place me elsewhere Yesbut it was impossible
the factories were all full Misfortunes never come single my aunt fell
ill and there was not a sou in the house I plucked up my courage and
returned to entreat the mercy of the clerk at the factory Nothing would
do So much the worse said he you are throwing away your luck If
you had been more complying I should perhaps have married you What
could I do Mother Arsenemisery was staring me in the face I had no
work my aunt was ill the clerk said he would marry meI did like so
many others

And when afterwards you spoke to him about marriage

Of course he laughed at me and in six months left me Then I wept
all the tears in my body till none remainedthen I was very illand
thenI console myself as one may console ones self for anything
After some changes I met with Philemon It is upon him that I revenge
myself for what others have done to me I am his tyrant added
RosePompon with a tragic air as the cloud passed away which had
darkened her pretty face during her recital to Mother Arsene

It is true said the latter thoughtfully They deceive a poor
girlwho is there to protect or defend her Oh the evil we do does not
always come from ourselves and then

I spy Ninny Moulin cried RosePompon interrupting the greengrocer
and pointing to the other side of the street How early abroad What
can he want with me and Rose wrapped herself still more closely and
modestly in her cloak

It was indeed Jacques Dumoulin who advanced with his hat stuck on one
side with rubicund nose and sparkling eye dressed in a loose coat
which displayed the rotundity of his abdomen His hands one of which
held a huge cane shouldered like a musket were plunged into the vast
pockets of his outer garment

Just as he reached the threshold of the door no doubt with the
intention of speaking to the portress he perceived RosePompon What
he exclaimed my pupil already stirring That is fortunate I came on
purpose to bless her at the rise of morn

So saying Ninny Moulin advanced with open arms towards RosePompon who
drew back a step

What ungrateful child resumed the writer on divinity Will you
refuse me the mornings paternal kiss

I accept paternal kisses from none but Philemon I had a letter from
him yesterday with a jar of preserves two geese a bottle of homemade
brandy and an eel What ridiculous presents I kept the drink and
changed the rest for two darling live pigeons which I have installed
in Philemons cabinet and a very pretty dovecote it makes me For the
rest my husband is coming back with seven hundred francs which he got
from his respectable family under pretence of learning the bass viol
the cornetapiston and the speaking trumpet so as to make his way in
society and a slapup marriageto use your expressionmy good child

Well my dear pupil we will taste the family brandy and enjoy
ourselves in expectation of Philemon and his seven hundred francs

So saying Ninny Moulin slapped the pockets of his waistcoat which
gave forth a metallic sound and added I come to propose to you to
embellish my life today and tomorrow and even the day after if your
heart is willing

If the announcements are decent and fraternal my heart does not say
no

Be satisfied I will act by you as your grandfather your great
grandfather your family portrait We will have a ride a dinner the
play a fancy dress ball and a supper afterwards Will that suit you

On condition that poor Cephyse is to go with us It will raise her
spirits

Well Cephyse shall be of the party

Have you come into a fortune great apostle

Better than that most rosy and pompous of all RosePom pons I am
head editor of a religious journal and as I must make some appearance
in so respectable a concern I ask every month for four weeks in
advance and three days of liberty On this condition I consent to play
the saint for twentyseven days out of thirty and to be always as grave
and heavy as the paper itself

A journal that will be something droll and dance forbidden steps all
alone on the tables of the cafes

Yes it will be droll enough but not for everybody They are rich
sacristans who pay the expenses They dont look to money provided the
journal bites tears burns pounds exterminates and destroys On my
word of honor I shall never have been in such a fury added Ninny
Moulin with a loud hoarse laugh I shall wash the wounds of my
adversaries with venom of the finest vintage and gall of the first
quality

For his peroration Ninny Moulin imitated the pop of uncorking a bottle
of champagnewhich made RosePompon laugh heartily

And what resumed she will be the name of your journal of
sacristans

It will be called Neighborly Love

Come that is a very pretty name

Wait a little there is a second title

Let us hear it

Neighborly Love or the Exterminator of the Incredulous the
Indifferent the Lukewarm and Others with this motto from the great
Bossuet Those who are not for us are against us

That is what Philemon says in the battles at the Chaumiere when he
shakes his cane

Which proves that the genius of the Eagle of Meaux is universal I
only reproach him for having been jealous of Moliere

Bah actors jealousy said RosePompon

Naughty girl cried Ninny Moulin threatening her with his finger

But if you are going to exterminate Madame de la SainteColombo who is
somewhat lukewarmhow about your marriage

My journal will advance it on the contrary Only think editorIn
chief is a superb position the sacristans will praise and push and
support and bless me I shall get LaSainteColombeand then what a
life Ill lead

At this moment a postman entered the shop and delivered a letter to
the greengrocer saying For M Charlemagne postpaid

My said RosePompon it is for the little mysterious old man who
has such extraordinary ways Does it come from far

I believe you it comes from Italy from Rome said Ninny Moulin
looking in his turn at the letter which the greengrocer held in her
hand Who is the astonishing little old man of whom you speak

Just imagine to yourself my great apostle said RosePompon a
little old man who has two rooms at the bottom of that court He never
sleeps there but comes from time to time and shuts himself up for
hours without ever allowing any one to enter his lodging and without
any one knowing what he does there

He is a conspirator said Ninny Moulin laughing or else a comer

Poor dear man said Mother Arsene what has he done with his false
money He pays me always in sous for the bit of bread and the radish I
furnish him for his breakfast

And what is the name of this mysterious chap asked Dumoulin

M Charlemagne said the greengrocer But look surely one speaks of
the devil one is sure to see his horns

Wheres the horns

There by the side of the housethat little old man who walks with
his neck awry and his umbrella under his arm

M Rodin ejaculated Ninny Moulin retreating hastily and descending
three steps into the shop in order not to be seen Then he added You
say that this gentleman calls himself

M Charlemagnedo you know him asked the greengrocer

What the devil does he do here under a false name said Jacques
Dumoulin to himself

You know him said RosePompon with impatience You are quite
confused

And this gentleman has two rooms in this house and comes here
mysteriously said Jacques Dumoulin more and more surprised

Yes resumed RosePompon you can see his windows from Philemons
dovecote

Quick quick let me go into the passage that I may not meet him
said Dumoulin

And without having been perceived by Rodin he glided from the shop
into the passage and thence mounted to the stairs which led to the
apartment occupied by RosePompon

Goodmorning M Charlemagne said Mother Arsene to Rodin who made
his appearance on the threshold You come twice in a day that is
right for your visits are extremely rare

You are too polite my good lady said Rodin with a very courteous
bow and he entered the shop of the greengrocer

21 There are really ordinances full of a touching interest for the
canine race which forbid the harnessing of dogs




CHAPTER XXIX THE DEN

Rodins countenance when he entered Mother Arsenes shop was
expressive of the most simple candor He leaned his hands on the knob of
his umbrella and said I much regret my good lady that I roused you
so early this morning

You do not come often enough my dear sir for me to find fault with
you

How can I help it my good lady I live in the country and only come
hither from time to time to settle my little affairs

Talking of that sir the letter you expected yesterday has arrived
this morning It is large and comes from far Here it is said the
greengrocer drawing it from her pocket it cost nothing for postage

Thank you my dear lady said Rodin taking the letter with apparent
indifference and putting it into the sidepocket of his greatcoat
which he carefully buttoned over

Are you going up to your rooms sir

Yes my good lady

Then I will get ready your little provisions said Mother Arsene as
usual I suppose my dear sir

Just as usual

It shall be ready in the twinkling of an eye sir

So saying the greengrocer took down an old basket after throwing
into it three or four pieces of turf a little bundle of wood and some
charcoal she covered all this fuel with a cabbage leaf then going to
the further end of the shop she took from a chest a large round loaf
cut off a slice and selecting a magnificent radish with the eye of a
connoisseur divided it in two made a hole in it which she filled with
gray salt joined the two pieces together again and placed it carefully
by the side of the bread on the cabbage leaf which separated the
eatables from the combustibles Finally taking some embers from the
stove she put them into a little earthen pot containing ashes which
she placed also in the basket

Then reascending to her top step Mother Arsene said to Rodin Here is
your basket sir

A thousand thanks my good lady answered Rodin and plunging his
hand into the pocket of his trousers he drew forth eight sous which he
counted out only one by one to the greengrocer and said to her as he
carried off his store Presently when I come down again I will return
your basket as usual

Quite at your service my dear sir quite at your service said Mother
Arsene

Rodin tucked his umbrella under his left arm took up the greengrocers
basket with his right hand entered the dark passage crossed the little
court and mounted with light step to the second story of a dilapidated
building there drawing a key from his pocket he opened a door which
he locked carefully after him The first of the two rooms which he
occupied was completely unfurnished as for the second it is impossible
to imagine a more gloomy and miserable den Papering so much worn torn
and faded that no one could recognize its primitive color bedecked
the walls A wretched flockbed covered with a mothfretted blanket a
stool and a little table of wormeaten wood an earthenware stove as
cracked as old china a trunk with a padlock placed under the bedsuch
was the furniture of this desolate hole A narrow window with dirty
panes hardly gave any light to this room which was almost deprived
of air by the height of the building in front two old cotton pocket
handkerchiefs fastened together with pins and made to slide upon a
string stretched across the window served for curtains The plaster
of the roof coming through the broken and disjointed tiles showed the
extreme neglect of the inhabitant of this abode After locking his door
Rodin threw his hat and umbrella on the bed placed his basket on the
ground set the radish and bread on the table and kneeling down before
his stove stuffed it with fuel and lighted it by blowing with vigorous
lungs on the embers contained in his earthen pot

When to use the consecrated expression the stove began to draw Rodin
spread out the handkerchiefs which served him for curtains then
thinking himself quite safe from every eye he took from the sidepocket
of his greatcoat the letter that Mother Arsene had given him In doing
so he brought out several papers and different articles one of these
papers folded into a thick and rumpled packet fell upon the table
and flew open It contained a silver cross of the Legion of Honor black
with time The red ribbon of this cross had almost entirely lost its
original color At sight of this cross which he replaced in his pocket
with the medal of which Faringhea had despoiled Djalma Rodin shrugged
his shoulders with a contemptuous and sardonic air then producing his
large silver watch he laid it on the table by the side of the letter
from Rome He looked at this letter with a singular mixture of suspicion
and hope of fear and impatient curiosity After a moments reflection
he prepared to unseal the envelope but suddenly he threw it down again
upon the table as if by a strange caprice he had wished to prolong
for a few minutes that agony of uncertainty as poignant and irritating
as the emotion of the gambler

Looking at his watch Rodin resolved not to open the letter until the
hand should mark halfpast nine of which it still wanted seven minutes
In one of those whims of puerile fatalism from which great minds have
not been exempt Rodin said to himself I burn with impatience to open
this letter If I do not open it till halfpast nine the news will be
favorable To employ these minutes Rodin took several turns up and
down the room and stood in admiring contemplation before two old
prints stained with damp and age and fastened to the wall by rusty
nails The first of these works of artthe only ornaments with which
Rodin had decorated this holewas one of those coarse pictures
illuminated with red yellow green and blue such as are sold at
fairs an Italian inscription announced that this print had been
manufactured at Rome It represented a woman covered with rags bearing
a wallet and having a little child upon her knees a horrible hag of
a fortuneteller held in her hands the hand of the little child and
seemed to read there his future fate for these words in large blue
letters issued from her mouth Sara Papa he shall be Pope

The second of these works of art which appeared to inspire Rodin with
deep meditations was an excellent etching whose careful finish and
bold correct drawing contrasted singularly with the coarse coloring
of the other picture This rare and splendid engraving which had cost
Rodin six louis an enormous expense for him represented a young boy
dressed in rags The ugliness of his features was compensated by the
intellectual expression of his strongly marked countenance Seated on
a stone surrounded by a herd of swine that he seemed employed in
keeping he was seen in front with his elbow resting on his knee and
his chin in the palm of his hand The pensive and reflective attitude
of this young man dressed as a beggar the power expressed in his large
forehead the acuteness of his penetrating glance and the firm lines
of the mouth seemed to reveal indomitable resolution combined with
superior intelligence and ready craft Beneath this figure the emblems
of the papacy encircled a medallion in the centre of which was the
head of an old man the lines of which strongly marked recalled in
a striking manner notwithstanding their look of advanced age the
features of the young swineherd This engraving was entitled THE YOUTH
of SIXTUS V the color print was entitled The Prediction22

In contemplating these prints more and more nearly with ardent and
inquiring eye as though he had asked for hopes or inspirations from
them Rodin had come so close that still standing with his right arm
bent behind his head he rested as it were against the wall whilst
hiding his left hand in the pocket of his black trousers he thus held
back one of the flaps of his olive greatcoat For some minutes he
remained in this meditative attitude

Rodin as we have said came seldom to this lodging according to the
rules of his Order he had till now lived with Father dAigrigny
whom he was specially charged to watch No member of the Society
particularly in the subaltern position which Rodin had hitherto held
could either shut himself in or possess an article of furniture made
to lock By this means nothing interferes with the mutual spysystem
incessantly carried on which forms one of the most powerful resources
of the Company of Jesus It was on account of certain combinations
purely personal to himself though connected on some points with the
interests of the Order that Rodin unknown to all had taken these
rooms in the Rue Clovis And it was from the depths of this obscure
den that the socius corresponded directly with the most eminent and
influential personages of the sacred college On one occasion when
Rodin wrote to Rome that Father dAigrigny having received orders to
quit France without seeing his dying mother had hesitated to set out
the socius had added in form of postscriptum at the bottom of the
letter denouncing to the General of the Order the hesitation of Father
dAigrigny

Tell the Prince Cardinal that he may rely upon me but I hope for his
active aid in return

This familiar manner of corresponding with the most powerful dignitary
of the Order the almost patronizing tone of the recommendation
that Rodin addressed to the Prince Cardinal proved that the socius
notwithstanding his apparently subaltern position was looked upon at
that epoch as a very important personage by many of the Princes of the
Church who wrote to him at Paris under a false name making use of a
cipher and other customary precautions After some moments passed in
contemplation before the portrait of Sixtus V Rodin returned slowly
to the table on which lay the letter which by a sort of superstitious
delay he had deferred opening notwithstanding his extreme curiosity
As it still wanted some minutes of halfpast nine Rodin in order not
to lose time set about making preparations for his frugal breakfast
He placed on the table by the side of an inkstand furnished with pens
the slice of bread and the radish then seating himself on his stool
with the stove as it were between his legs he drew a hornhandled
knife from his pocket and cutting alternately a morsel of bread and a
morsel of radish with a sharp wellworn blade he began his temperate
repast with a vigorous appetite keeping his eye fixed on the hand of
his watch When it reached the momentous hour he unsealed the envelope
with a trembling hand

It contained two letters The first appeared to give him little
satisfaction for after some minutes he shrugged his shoulders struck
the table impatiently with the handle of his knife disdainfully pushed
aside the letter with the back of his dirty hand and perused the second
epistle holding his bread in one hand and with the other mechanically
dipping a slice of radish into the gray salt spilt on a corner of the
table Suddenly Rodins hand remained motionless As he progressed
in his reading he appeared more and more interested surprised and
struck Rising abruptly he ran to the window as if to assure himself
by a second examination of the cipher that he was not deceived The
news announced to him in the letter seemed to be unexpected No doubt
Rodin found that he had deciphered correctly for letting fall his
arms not in dejection but with the stupor of a satisfaction as
unforeseen as extraordinary he remained for some time with his head
down and his eyes fixedthe only mark of joy that he gave being
manifested by a loud frequent and prolonged respiration Men who are
as audacious in their ambition as they are patient and obstinate in
their mining and countermining are surprised at their own success when
this latter precedes and surpasses their wise and prudent expectations
Rodin was now in this case Thanks to prodigies of craft address and
dissimulation thanks to mighty promises of corruption thanks to the
singular mixture of admiration fear and confidence with which his
genius inspired many influential persons Rodin now learned from members
of the pontifical government that in case of a possible and probable
occurrence he might within a given time aspire with a good chance of
success to a position which has too often excited the fear the hate
or the envy of many sovereigns and which has in turn been occupied by
great good men by abominable scoundrels and by persons risen from
the lowest grades of society But for Rodin to attain this end with
certainty it was absolutely necessary for him to succeed in that
project which he had undertaken to accomplish without violence and
only by the play and the rebound of passions skillfully managed The
project was To secure for the Society of Jesus the fortune of the
Rennepont family

This possession would thus have a double and immense result for Rodin
acting in accordance with his personal views intended to make of his
Order whose chief was at his discretion a steppingstone and a means
of intimidation When his first impression of surprise had passed
awayan impression that was only a sort of modesty of ambition and
self diffidence not uncommon with men of really superior powersRodin
looked more coldly and logically on the matter and almost reproached
himself for his surprise But soon after by a singular contradiction
yielding to one of those puerile and absurd ideas by which men are
often carried away when they think themselves alone and unobserved
Rodin rose abruptly took the letter which had caused him such glad
surprise and went to display it as it were before the eyes of the
young swineherd in the picture then shaking his head proudly and
triumphantly casting his reptileglance on the portrait he muttered
between his teeth as he placed his dirty finger on the pontifical
emblem Eh brother and I alsoperhaps

After this ridiculous interpolation Rodin returned to his seat and
as if the happy news he had just received had increased his appetite he
placed the letter before him to read it once more whilst he exercised
his teeth with a sort of joyous fury on his hard bread and radish
chanting an old Litany

There was something strange great and above all frightful in the
contrast afforded by this immense ambition already almost justified
by events and contained as it were in so miserable an abode Father
dAigrigny who if not a very superior man had at least some real
value was a person of high birth very haughty and placed in the best
society would never have ventured to aspire to what Rodin thus looked
to from the first The only aim of Father dAigrigny and even this
he thought presumptuous was to be one day elected General of his
Orderthat Order which embraced the world The difference of the
ambitious aptitudes of these two personages is conceivable When a man
of eminent abilities of a healthy and vivacious nature concentrates
all the strength of his mind and body upon a single point remaining
like Rodin obstinately chaste and frugal and renouncing every
gratification of the heart and the sensesthe man who revolts against
the sacred designs of his Creator does so almost always in favor of
some monstrous and devouring passionsome infernal divinity which
by a sacrilegious pact asks of him in return for the bestowal of
formidable power the destruction of every noble sentiment and of all
those ineffable attractions and tender instincts with which the Maker
in His eternal wisdom and inexhaustible munificence has so paternally
endowed His creatures

During the scene that we have just described Rodin had not perceived
that the curtain of a window on the third story of the building opposite
had been partially drawn aside and had halfrevealed the sprightly face
of RosePompon and the Silenuslike countenance of Ninny Moulin
It ensued that Rodin notwithstanding his barricade of cotton
handkerchiefs had not been completely sheltered from the indiscreet and
curious examination of the two dancers of the Stormblown Tulip

22 According to the tradition it was predicted to the mother of
Sixtus V that he would be pope and in his youth he is said to have
kept swine




CHAPTER XXX AN UNEXPECTED VISIT

Though Rodin had experienced much surprise on reading the second letter
from Rome he did not choose that his answer should betray any such
amazement Having finished his frugal breakfast he took a sheet of
paper and rapidly wrote in cipher the following note in the short
abrupt style that was natural to him when not obliged to restrain
himself

The information does not surprise me I had foreseen it all Indecision
and cowardice always bear such fruit This is not enough Heretical
Russia murders Catholic Poland Rome blesses the murderers and curses
the victims23

Let it pass

In return Russia guarantees to Rome by Austria the bloody
suppression of the patriots of Romagna

That too is well

The cutthroat band of good Cardinal Albani is not sufficient for the
massacre of the impious liberals They are weary of the task

Not so well They must go on

When Rodin had written these last words his attention was suddenly
attracted by the clear and sonorous voice of RosePompon who knowing
her Beranger by heart had opened Philemons window and seated on the
sill sang with much grace and prettiness this verse of the immortal
songwriter

 How wrong you are Ist you dare say
 That heaven ever scowls on earth
 The earth that laughs up to its blue
 The earth that owes it joy and birth
 Oh may the wine from vines it warms
 May holy love thence fluttering down
 Lend my philosophy their charms
 To drive away cares direful frown
 So firm lets stand
 Full glass in hand
 And all evoke
 The God of honest folk

This song in its divine gentleness contrasted so strangely with the
cold cruelty of the few lines written by Rodin that he started and bit
his lips with rage as he recognized the words of the great poet truly
Christian who had dealt such rude blows to the false Church Rodin
waited for some moments with angry impatience thinking the voice would
continue but RosePompon was silent or only continued to hum and soon
changed to another air that of the Good Pope which she entoned but
without words Rodin not venturing to look out of his window to see who
was this troublesome warbler shrugged his shoulders resumed his pen
and continued

To it again We must exasperate the independent spirits in all
countriesexcite philosophic rage all over Europe make liberalism foam
at the mouthraise all that is wild and noisy against Rome To
effect this we must proclaim in the face of the world these three
propositions 1 It is abominable to assert that a man may be saved in
any faith whatever provided his morals be pure 2 It is odious and
absurd to grant liberty of conscience to the people 3 The liberty of
the press cannot be held in too much horror24

We must bring the Papfed man to declare these propositions in
every respect orthodoxshow him their good effect upon despotic
governmentsupon true Catholics the muzzlers of the people He will
fall into the snare The propositions once published the storm will
burst forth A general rising against Romea wide schismthe sacred
college divided into three parties One approvesthe other blamesthe
third trembles The Sick Man still more frightened than he is now at
having allowed the destruction of Poland will shrink from the clamors
reproaches threats and violent ruptures that he has occasioned

That is welland goes far

Then set the Pope to shaking the conscience of the Sick Man to
disturb his mind and terrify his soul

To sum up Make everything bitter to himdivide his councilisolate
himfrighten himredouble the ferocious ardor of good Albinirevive
the appetite of the Sanfedists25give them a gulf of liberalslet
there be pillage rape massacre as at Cesenaa downright river
of Carbonaro bloodthe Sick Man will have a surfeit of it So many
butcheries in his namehe will shrink be sure he will shrinkevery
day will have its remorse every night its terror every minute
its anguish and the abdication he already threatens will come at
lastperhaps too soon That is now the only danger you must provide
against it

In case of an abdication the grand penitentiary has understood me
Instead of confiding to a general the direction of our Order the best
militia of the Holy See I should command it myself Thenceforward this
militia would give me no uneasiness For instance the Janissaries and
the Praetorian Guards were always fatal to authoritywhybecause
they were able to organize themselves as defenders of the government
independently of the government hence their power of intimidation

Clement XIV was a fool To brand and abolish our Company was an absurd
fault To protect and make it harmless by declaring himself the General
of the Order is what he should have done The Company then at his
mercy would have consented to anything He would have absorbed us made
us vassals of the Holy See and would no longer have had to fear our
services Clement XIV died of the cholic Let him heed who hears In a
similar case I should not die the same death

Just then the clear and liquid voice of RosePompon was again heard
Rodin bounded with rage upon his seat but soon as he listened to the
following verse new to him for unlike Philemons widow he had not
his Beranger at his fingers ends the Jesuit accessible to certain
odd superstitious notions was confused and almost frightened at so
singular a coincidence It is Berangers Good Pope who speaks

 What are monarchs sheepish sots
 Or theyre robbers puffed with pride
 Wearing badges of crime blots
 Till their certain graves gape wide
 If theyll pour out coin for me
 Ill absolve themskin and bone
 If they hagglethey shall see
 My nieces dancing on their throne
 So laugh away
 Leap my fay
 Only watch one hurt the thunder
 First of all by Zeus under
 Im the Pope the whole worlds wonder

Rodin halfrisen from his chair with outstretched neck and attentive
eye was still listening when RosePompon flitting like a bee from
flower to flower of her repertoire had already begun the delightful air
of Colibri Hearing no more the Jesuit reseated himself in a sort
of stupor but after some minutes reflection his countenance again
brightened up and he seemed to see a lucky omen in this singular
incident He resumed his pen and the first words he wrote partook as
it were of this strange confidence in fate

I have never had more hope of success than at this moment Another
reason to neglect nothing Every presentiment demands redoubled zeal A
new thought occurred to me yesterday

We shall act here in concert I have founded an ultraCatholic paper
called Neighborly Love From its ultramontane tyrannical liberticidal
fury it will be thought the organ of Rome I will confirm these
reports They will cause new terrors

That will be well

I shall raise the question of the liberty of instruction The raw
liberals will support us Like fools they admit us to equal rights
when our privileges our influence of the confessional our obedience to
Rome all place us beyond the circle of equal rights by the advantages
which we enjoy Double fools they think us disarmed because they have
disarmed themselves towards us

A burning questionirritating clamorsnew cause of disgust for the
Weak Man Every little makes a mickle

That also is very well

To sum up all in two words The end is abdicationthe means vexation
incessant torture The Rennepont inheritance wilt pay for the election
The price agreed the merchandise will be sold

Rodin here paused abruptly thinking he had heard some noise at that
door of his which opened on the staircase therefore he listened with
suspended breath but all remaining silent he thought he must have been
deceived and took up his pen

I will take care of the Rennepont businessthe hinge on which
will turn our temporal operations We must begin from the
foundationsubstitute the play of interests and the springs of
passion for the stupid club law of Father dAigrigny He nearly
compromised everythingand yet he has good parts knows the world has
powers of seduction quick insightbut plays ever in a single key and
is not great enough to make himself little In his stead I shall know
how to make use of him There is good stuff in the man I availed myself
in time of the full powers given by the R F G I may inform Father
dAigrigny in case of need of the secret engagements taken by the
General towards myself Until now I have let him invent for this
inheritance the destination that you know of A good thought but
unseasonable The same end by other means

The information was false There are over two hundred millions Should
the eventuality occur what was doubtful must become certain An immense
latitude is left us The Rennepont business is now doubly mine and
within three months the two hundred millions will be ours by the
free will of the heirs themselves It must be so for this failing the
temporal part would escape me and my chances be diminished by one half
I have asked for full powers time presses and I act as if I had
them One piece of information is indispensable for the success of my
projects I expect it from you and I must have it do you understand
me The powerful influence of your brother at the Court of Vienna will
serve you in this I wish to have the most precise details as to the
present position of the Duke de Reichstadtthe Napoleon II of the
Imperialists Is it possible by means of your brother to open a secret
correspondence with the prince unknown to his attendants

Look to this promptly It is urgent This note will be sent off to day
I shall complete it tomorrow It will reach you as usual by the hands
of the petty shopkeeper

At the moment when Rodin was sealing this letter within a double
envelope he thought that he again heard a noise at the door He
listened After some silence several knocks were distinctly audible
Rodin started It was the first time any one had knocked at his door
since nearly a twelvemonth that he occupied this room Hastily placing
the letter in his greatcoat pocket the Jesuit opened the old trunk
under his bed took from it a packet of papers wrapped in a tattered
cotton handkerchief added to them the two letters in cipher he had
just received and carefully relocked the trunk The knocking continued
without and seemed to show more and more impatience Rodin took the
greengrocers basket in his hand tucked his umbrella under his arm and
went with some uneasiness to ascertain who was this unexpected visitor
He opened the door and found himself face to face with RosePompon the
troublesome singer and who now with a light and pretty courtesy said
to him in the most guileless manner in the world M Rodin if you
please

23 On page 110 of Lamennais Affaires de Rome will be seen the
following admirable scathing of Rome by the most truly evangelical
spirit of our age So long as the issue of the conflict between Poland
and her oppressors remained in the balances the papal official organ
contained not one word to offend the so long victorious nation but
hardly had she gone down under the Czars atrocious vengeance and the
long torture of a whole land doomed to rack and exile and servitude
began than this same journal found no language black enough to stain
those whom fortune had fled Yet it is wrong to charge this unworthy
insult to papal power it only cringes to the law which Russia lays down

CHAPTER XXXI FRIENDLY SERVICES

Notwithstanding his surprise and uneasiness Rodin did not frown He
began by locking his door after him as he noticed the young girls
inquisitive glance Then he said to her goodnaturedly Who do you
want my dear

M Rodin repeated RosePompon stoutly opening her bright blue eyes
to their full extent and looking Rodin full in the face

Its not here said he moving towards the stairs I do not know him
Inquire above or below

No you dont giving yourself airs at your age said RosePompon
shrugging her shoulders As if we did not know that you are M Rodin

Charlemagne said the socius bowing Charlemagne to serve youif I
am able

You are not able answered RosePompon majestically then she added
with a mocking air So we have our little pussycat hidingplaces we
change our name we are afraid Mamma Rodin will find us out

Come my dear child said the socius with a paternal smile you have
come to the right quarter I am an old man but I love youthhappy
joyous youth Amuse yourself pray at my expense Only let me pass for
I am in a hurry And Rodin again advanced towards the stairs

M Rodin said RosePompon in a solemn voice I have very important
things to say to you and advice to ask about a love affair

Why little madcap that you are have you nobody to tease in your own
house that you must come here

I lodge in this house M Rodin answered RosePompon laying a
malicious stress on the name of her victim

You Oh dear only to think I did not know I had such a pretty
neighbor

Yes I have lodged here six months M Rodin

Really where

On the third story front M Rodin

It was you then that sang so well just now

Rather

You gave me great pleasure I must say

You are very polite M Rodin

You lodge I suppose with your respectable family

I believe you M Rodin said RosePompon casting down her eyes
with a timid air I lodge with Grandpapa Philemon and Grandmamma
Bacchanalwho is a queen and no mistake

Rodin had hitherto been seriously uneasy not knowing in what manner
Rose had discovered his real name But on hearing her mention the
Bacchanal queen with the information that she lodged in the house
he found something to compensate for the disagreeable incident of
RosePompons appearance It was indeed important to Rodin to find
out the Bacchanal Queen the mistress of Sleepinbuff and the sister of
Mother Bunch who had been noted as dangerous since her interview with
the superior of the convent and the part she had taken in the projected
escape of Mdlle de Cardoville Moreover Rodin hopedthanks to what he
had just heardto bring RosePompon to confess to him the name of the
person from whom she had learned that Charlemagne masked Rodin

Hardly had the young girl pronounced the name of the Bacchanal queen
than Rodin clasped his hands and appeared as much surprised as
interested

Oh my dear child he exclaimed I conjure you not to jest on this
subject Are you speaking of a young girl who bears that nickname the
sister of a deformed needlewoman

Yes sir the Bacchanal Queen is her nickname said RosePompon
astonished in her turn she is really Cephyse Soliveau and she is my
friend

Oh she is your friend said Rodin reflecting

Yes sir my bosom friend

So you love her

Like a sister Poor girl I do what I can for her and thats not much
But how comes it that a respectable man of your age should know the
Bacchanal QueenAh that shows you have a false name

My dear child I am no longer inclined to laugh said Rodin with
so sorrowful an air that RosePompon reproaching herself with her
pleasantry said to him But how comes it that you know Cephyse

Alas I do not know herbut a young fellow that I like excessively

Jacques Rennepont

Otherwise called Sleepinbuff He is now in prison for debt sighed
Rodin I saw him yesterday

You saw him yesterdayhow strange said RosePompon clapping her
hands Quick quickcome over to Philemons to give Cephyse news of
her lover She is so uneasy about him

My dear child I should like to give her good news of that worthy
fellow whom I like in spite of his follies for who has not been guilty
of follies added Rodin with indulgent goodnature

To be sure said RosePompon twisting about as if she still wore the
costume of a debardeur

I will say more added Rodin I love him because of his follies for
talk as we may my dear child there is always something good at bottom
a good heart or something in those who spend generously their money
for other people

Well come you are a very good sort of a man said RosePompon
enchanted with Rodins philosophy But why will you not come and see
Cephyse and talk to her of Jacques

Of what use would it be to tell her what she knows alreadythat
Jacques is in prison What I should like would be to get the worthy
fellow out of his scrape

Oh sir only do that only get Jacques out of prison cried Rose
Pompon warmly and we will both give you a kissme and Cephyse

It would be throwing kisses away dear little madcap said Rodin
smiling But be satisfied I want no reward to induce me to do good
when I can

Then you hope to get Jacques out of prison

Rodin shook his head and answered with a grieved and disappointed air
I did hope it Certainly I did hope it but now all is changed

Hows that asked RosePompon with surprise

That foolish joke of calling me M Rodin may appear very amusing to
you my dear child I understand it you being only an echo Some one
has said to you Go and tell M Charlemagne that he is one M Rodin
That will be very funny

Certainly I should never myself have thought of calling you M Rodin
One does not invent such names answered RosePompon

Well that person with his foolish jokes has done without knowing it
a great injury to Jacques Rennepont

What because I called you Rodin instead of Charlemagne cried Rose
Pompon much regretting the pleasantry which she had carried on at the
instigation of Ninny Moulin But really sir she added what can
this joke have to do with the service that you were about to render
Jacques

I am not at liberty to tell you my child In truth I am very sorry
for poor Jacques Believe me I am but do let me pass

Listen to me sir I beg said RosePompon if I told you the name
of the person who told me to call you Rodin would you interest yourself
again for Jacques

I do not wish to know any ones secrets my dear child In all this
you have been the echo of persons who are perhaps very dangerous
and notwithstanding the interest I feel for Jacques Rennepont I do not
wish you understand to make myself enemies Heaven forbid

RosePompon did not at all comprehend Rodins fears and upon this he
had counted for after a seconds reflection the young girl resumed
Well sirthis is too deep for me I do not understand it All I know
is that I am truly sorry if I have injured a good young man by a mere
joke I will tell you exactly how it happened My frankness may be of
some use

Frankness will often clear up the most obscure matters said Rodin
sententiously

After all said RosePompon its Ninnys fault Why does he tell
me nonsense that might injure poor Cephyses lover You see sir it
happened in this way Ninny Moulin who is fond of a joke saw you just
now in the street The portress told him that your name was Charlemagne
He said to me No his name is Rodin We must play him a trick Go to
his room RosePompon knock at the door and call him M Rodin You
will see what a rum face he will make I promised Ninny Moulin not to
name him but I do it rather than run the risk of injuring Jacques

At Ninny Moulins name Rodin had not been able to repress a movement of
surprise This pamphleteer whom he had employed to edit the Neighborly
Love was not personally formidable but being fond of talking in
his drink he might become troublesome particularly if Rodin as was
probable had often to visit this house to execute his project upon
Sleepinbuff through the medium of the Bacchanal Queen The socius
resolved therefore to provide against this inconvenience

So my dear child said he to RosePompon it is a M Desmoulins that
persuaded you to play off this silly joke

Not Desmoulins but Dumoulin corrected Rose He writes in the
pewholders papers and defends the saints for money for if Ninny
Moulin is a saint his patrons are Saint Drinkard and Saint Flashette
as he himself declares

This gentleman appears to be very gay

Oh a very good fellow

But stop resumed Rodin appearing to recollect himself aint he a
man about thirtysix or forty fat with a ruddy complexion

Ruddy as a glass of red wine said RosePompon and with a pimpled
nose like a mulberry

Thats the manM Dumoulin Oh in that case I am quite satisfied
my dear child The jest no longer makes me uneasy for M Dumoulin is a
very worthy manonly perhaps a little too fond of his joke

Then sir you will try to be useful to Jacques The stupid pleasantry
of Ninny Moulin will not prevent you

I hope not

But I must not tell Ninny Moulin that you know it was he who sent me to
call you M Rodineh sir

Why not In every case my dear child it is always better to speak
frankly the truth

But sir Ninny Moulin so strongly recommended me not to name him to
you

If you have named him it is from a very good motive why not avow
it However my dear child this concerns you not me Do as you think
best

And may I tell Cephyse of your good intentions towards Jacques

The truth my dear child always the truth One need never hesitate to
say what is

Poor Cephyse how happy she will be cried RosePompon cheerfully
and the news will come just in time

Only you must not exaggerate I do not promise positively to get this
good fellow out of prison I say that I will do what I can But what I
promise positively isfor since the imprisonment of poor Jacques your
friend must be very much straitened

Alas sir

What I promise positively is some little assistance which your friend
will receive today to enable her to live honestly and if she behaves
wellhereafterwhy hereafter we shall see

Oh sir you do not know how welcome will be your assistance to poor
Cephyse One might fancy you were her actual good angel Faith you may
call yourself Rodin or Charlemagne all I know is that you are a nice
sweet

Come come do not exaggerate said Rodin say a good sort of old
fellow nothing more my dear child But see how things fall out
sometimes Who could have told me when I heard you knock at my
doorwhich I must say vexed me a great dealthat it was a pretty
little neighbor of mine who under the pretext of playing off a joke
was to put me in the way of doing a good action Go and comfort your
friend this evening she will receive some assistance and let us have
hope and confidence Thanks be there are still some good people in the
world

Oh sir you prove it yourself

Not at all The happiness of the old is to see the young happy

This was said by Rodin with so much apparent kindness that RosePompon
felt the tears well up to her eyes and answered with much emotion
Sir Cephyse and me are only poor girls there are many more virtuous
in the world but I venture to say we have good hearts Now if ever
you should be ill only send for us there are no Sisters of Charity
that will take better care of you It is all that we can offer you
without reckoning Philemon who shall go through fire and water for
you I give you my word for itand Cephyse I am sure will answer for
Jacques also that he will be yours in life and death

You see my dear child that I was right in sayinga fitful head and a
good heart Adieu till we meet again

Thereupon Rodin taking up the basket which he had placed on the ground
by the side of his umbrella prepared to descend the stairs

First of all you must give me this basket it will be in your way
going down said RosePompon taking the basket from the hands of
Rodin notwithstanding his resistance Then she added Lean upon my
arm The stairs are so dark You might slip

I will accept your offer my dear child for I am not very courageous
Leaning paternally on the right arm of RosePompon who held the
basket in her left hand Rodin descended the stairs and crossed the
courtyard

Up there on the third story do you see that big face close to the
windowframe said RosePompon suddenly to Rodin stopping in the
centre of the little court That is my Ninny Moulin Do you know him
Is he the same as yours

The same as mine said Rodin raising his head and waving his hand
very affectionately to Jacques Dumoulin who stupefied thereat retired
abruptly from the window

The poor fellow I am sure he is afraid of me since his foolish joke
said Rodin smiling He is very wrong

And he accompanied these last words with a sinister nipping of the lips
not perceived by RosePompon

And now my dear child said he as they both entered the passage I
no longer need you assistance return to your friend and tell her the
good news you have heard

Yes sir you are right I burn with impatience to tell her what a good
man you are And RosePompon sprung towards the stairs

Stop stop how about my basket that the little madcap carries off with
her said Rodin

Oh true I beg your pardon sir Poor Cephyse how pleased she will be
Adieu sir And RosePompons pretty figure disappeared in the darkness
of the staircase which she mounted with an alert and impatient step

Rodin issued from the entry Here is your basket my good lady said
he stopping at the threshold of Mother Arsenes shop I give you my
humble thanks for your kindness

For nothing my dear sir for nothing It is all at your service Well
was the radish good

Succulent my dear madame and excellent

Oh I am glad of it Shall we soon see you again

I hope so But could you tell me where is the nearest postoffice

Turn to the left the third house at the grocers

A thousand thanks

I wager its a love letter for your sweetheart said Mother Arsene
enlivened probably by Rose Pompons and Ninny Moulins proximity

Ha ha ha the good lady said Rodin with a titter Then suddenly
resuming his serious aspect he made a low bow to the greengrocer
adding Your most obedient humble servant and walked out into the
street

We now usher the reader into Dr Baleiniers asylum in which Mdlle de
Cardoville was confined




CHAPTER XXXII THE ADVICE

Adrienne de Cardoville had been still more strictly confined in Dr
Baleiniers house since the double nocturnal attempt of Agricola and
Dagobert in which the soldier though severely wounded had succeeded
thanks to the intrepid devotion of his son seconded by the heroic Spoil
sport in gaining the little garden gate of the convent and escaping by
way of the boulevard along with the young smith Four oclock had just
struck Adrienne since the previous day had been removed to a chamber
on the second story of the asylum The grated window with closed
shutters only admitted a faint light to this apartment The young lady
since her interview with Mother Bunch expected to be delivered any day
by the intervention of her friends But she felt painful uneasiness on
the subject of Agricola and Dagobert being absolutely ignorant of the
issue of the struggle in which her intended liberators had been engaged
with the people of the asylum and convent She had in vain questioned
her keepers on the subject they had remained perfectly mute These new
incidents had augmented the bitter resentment of Adrienne against the
Princess de Saint Dizier Father dAigrigny and their creatures The
slight paleness of Mdlle de Cardovilles charming face and her fine
eyes a little drooping betrayed her recent sufferings seated before
a little table with her forehead resting upon one of her hands half
veiled by the long curls of her golden hair she was turning over the
leaves of a book Suddenly the door opened and M Baleinier entered
The doctor a Jesuit in lay attire a docile and passive instrument
of the will of his Order was only half in the confidence of Father
dAigrigny and the Princess de SaintDizier He was ignorant of the
object of the imprisonment of Mdlle de Cardoville he was ignorant also
of the sudden change which had taken place in the relative position
of Father dAigrigny and Rodin after the reading of the testament
of Marius de Rennepont The doctor had only the day before received
orders from Father dAigrigny now acting under the directions of Rodin
to confine Mdlle de Cardoville still more strictly to act towards her
with redoubled severity and to endeavor to force her it will be seen
by what expedients to renounce the judicial proceedings which she
promised herself to take hereafter against her persecutors At sight of
the doctor Mdlle de Cardoville could not hide the aversion and disdain
with which this man inspired her M Baleinier on the contrary always
smiling always courteous approached Adrienne with perfect ease and
confidence stopped a few steps from her as if to study her features
more attentively and then added like a man who is satisfied with the
observations he had made Come the unfortunate events of the night
before last have had a less injurious influence than I feared There is
some improvement the complexion is less flushed the look calmer
the eyes still somewhat too bright but no longer shining with such
unnatural fire You are getting on so well Now the cure must be
prolongedfor this unfortunate night affair threw you into a state
of excitement that was only the more dangerous from your not being
conscious of it Happily with care your recovery will not I hope be
very much delayed Accustomed though she was to the audacity of this
tool of the Congregation Mdlle de Cardoville could not forbear saying
to him with a smile of bitter disdain What impudence sir there is
in your probity What effrontery in your zeal to earn your hire Never
for a moment do you lay aside your mask craft and falsehood are ever on
your lips Really if this shameful comedy causes you as much fatigue as
it does me disgust and contempt they can never pay you enough

Alas said the doctor in a sorrowful tone always this unfortunate
delusion that you are not in want of our carethat I am playing a
part when I talk to you of the sad state in which you were when we were
obliged to bring you hither by stratagem Still with the exception of
this little sign of rebellious insanity your condition has marvellously
improved You are on the highroad to a complete cure Byandby your
excellent heart will render me the justice that is due to me and one
day I shall be judged as I deserve

I believe it sir the day approaches in which you will be judged as
you deserve said Adrienne laying great stress upon the two words

Always that other fixed idea said the doctor with a sort of
commiseration Come be reasonable Do not think of this childishness

What renounce my intention to demand at the hands of justice
reparation for myself and disgrace for you and your accomplices Never
sirnever

Well said the doctor shrugging his shoulders once at liberty
thank heaven you will have many other things to think of my fair
enemy

You forget piously the evil that you do but I sir have a better
memory

Let us talk seriously Have you really the intention of applying to the
courts inquired Dr Baleinier in a grave tone

Yes sir and you know that what I intend I firmly carry out

Well I can only conjure you not to follow out this idea replied the
doctor in a still more solemn tone I ask it as a favor in the name
of your own interest

I think sir that you are a little too ready to confound your interest
with mine

Now come said Dr Baleinier with a feigned impatience as if quite
certain of convincing Mdlle de Cardoville on the instant would you
have the melancholy courage to plunge into despair two persons full of
goodness and generosity

Only two The jest would be complete if you were to reckon three
you sir and my aunt and Abbe dAigrigny for these are no doubt the
generous persons in whose name you implore my pity

No madame I speak neither of myself nor of your aunt nor of Abbe
dAigrigny

Of whom then sir asked Mdlle de Cardoville with surprise

Of two poor fellows who no doubt sent by those whom you call your
friends got into the neighboring convent the other night and thence
into this garden The guns which you heard go off were fired at them

Alas I thought so They refused to tell me if either of them was
wounded said Adrienne with painful emotion

One of them received a wound but not very serious since he was able
to fly and escape pursuit

Thank God cried Mdlle de Cardoville clasping her hands with fervor

It is quite natural that you should rejoice at their escape but
by what strange contradiction do you now wish to put the officers of
justice on their track A singular manner truly of rewarding their
devotion

What do you say sir asked Mdlle de Cardoville

For if they should be arrested resumed Dr Baleinier without
answering her as they have been guilty of housebreaking and attempted
burglary they would be sent to the galleys

Heavens and for my sake

Yes it would be for you and what is worse by you that they would be
condemned

By me sir

Certainly that is if you follow up your vengeance against your aunt
and Abbe dAigrignyI do not speak of myself for I am quite safe in
a word if you persist in laying your complaint before the magistrates
that you have been unjustly confined in this house

I do not understand you sir Explain yourself said Adrienne with
growing uneasiness

Child that you are cried the Jesuit of the short robe with an air of
conviction do you think that if the law once takes cognizance of this
affair you can stop short its action where and when you please When
you leave this house you lodge a complaint against me and against
your family well what happens The law interferes inquires calls
witnesses enters into the most minute investigations Then what
follows Why that this nocturnal escalade which the superior of the
convent has some interest in hushing up for fear of scandalthat this
nocturnal attempt I say which I also would keep quiet is necessarily
divulged and as it involves a serious crime to which a heavy penalty
is attached the law will ferret into it and find out these unfortunate
men and if as is probable they are detained in Paris by their duties
or occupations or even by a false security arising from the honorable
motives which they know to have actuated them they will be arrested
And who will be the cause of this arrest You by your deposition
against us

Oh sir that would be horrible but it is impossible

It is very possible on the contrary returned M Baleinier so that
while I and the superior of the convent who alone are really entitled
to complain only wish to keep quiet this unpleasant affair it is
youyou for whom these unfortunate men have risked the galleysthat
will deliver them up to justice

Though Mdlle de Cardoville was not completely duped by the lay Jesuit
she guessed that the merciful intentions which he expressed with regard
to Dagobert and his son would be absolutely subordinate to the course
she might take in pressing or abandoning the legitimate vengeance which
she meant to claim of authority Indeed Rodin whose instructions the
doctor was following without knowing it was too cunning to have it said
to Mdlle de Cardoville If you attempt any proceedings we denounce
Dagobert and his son but he attained the same end by inspiring
Adrienne with fears on the subject of her two liberators so as to
prevent her taking any hostile measures Without knowing the exact law
on the subject Mdlle de Cardoville had too much good sense not to
understand that Dagobert and Agricola might be very seriously involved
in consequence of their nocturnal adventure and might even find
themselves in a terrible position And yet when she thought of all
she had suffered in that house and of all the just resentment she
entertained in the bottom of her heart Adrienne felt unwilling to
renounce the stern pleasure of exposing such odious machinations to the
light of day Dr Baleinier watched with sullen attention her whom he
considered his dupe for he thought he could divine the cause of the
silence and hesitation of Mdlle de Cardoville

But sir resumed the latter unable to conceal her anxiety if I
were disposed for whatever reason to make no complaint and to forget
the wrongs I have suffered when should I leave this place

I cannot tell for I do not know when you will be radically cured
said the doctor benignantly You are in a very good way but

Still this insolent and stupid acting broke forth Mdlle de
Cardoville interrupting the doctor with indignation I ask and if it
must be I entreat you to tell me how long I am to be shut up in this
dreadful house for I shall leave it some day I suppose

I hope so certainly said the Jesuit of the short robe with unction
but when I am unable to say Moreover I must tell you frankly that
every precaution is taken against such attempts as those of the other
night and the most vigorous watch will be maintained to prevent your
communicating with any one And all this in your own interest that your
poor head may not again be dangerously excited

So sir said Adrienne almost terrified compared with what awaits
me the last few days have been days of liberty

Your interest before everything answered the doctor in a fervent
tone

Mdlle de Cardoville feeling the impotence of her indignation and
despair heaved a deep sigh and hid her face in her hands

At this moment quick footsteps were heard in the passage and one of
the nurses entered after having knocked at the door

Sir said she to the doctor with a frightened air there are two
gentlemen below who wish to see you instantly and the lady also

Adrienne raised her head hastily her eyes were bathed in tears

What are the names of these persons said M Baleinier much
astonished

One of them said to me answered the nurse Go and inform Dr
Baleinier that I am a magistrate and that I come on a duty regarding
Mdlle de Cardoville

A magistrate exclaimed the Jesuit of the short robe growing purple
in the face and unable to hide his surprise and uneasiness

Heaven be praised cried Adrienne rising with vivacity her
countenance beaming through her tears with hope and joy my friends
have been informed in time and the hour of justice is arrived

Ask these persons to walk up said Dr Baleinier after a moments
reflection Then with a still more agitated expression of countenance
he approached Adrienne with a harsh and almost menacing air which
contrasted with the habitual placidity of his hypocritical smile and
said to her in a low voice Take care madame do not rejoice too
soon

I no longer fear you answered Mdlle de Cardoville with a bright
flashing eye M de Montbron is no doubt returned to Paris and has
been informed in time He accompanies the magistrate and comes to
deliver me I pity you sirboth you and yours added Adrienne with
an accent of bitter irony

Madame cried M Baleinier no longer able to dissemble his growing
alarm I repeat to you take care Remember what I have told you Your
accusations would necessarily involve the discovery of what took place
the other night Beware the fate of the soldier and his son is in your
hands Recollect they are in danger of the convicts chains

Oh I am not your dupe sir You are holding out a covert menace
Have at least the courage to say to me that if I complain to the
magistrates you will denounce the soldier and his son

I repeat that if you make any complaint those two people are lost
answered the doctor ambiguously

Startled by what was really dangerous in the doctors threats Adrienne
asked Sir if this magistrate questions me do you think I will tell
him a falsehood

You will answer what is true said M Baleinier hastily in the hope
of still attaining his end You will answer that you were in so excited
a state of mind a few days ago that it was thought advisable for your
own sake to bring you hither without your knowing it But you are now
so much better that you acknowledge the utility of the measures taken
with regard to you I will confirm these words for after all it is the
truth

Never cried Mdlle de Cardoville with indignation never will I be
the accomplice of so infamous a falsehood never will I be base enough
to justify the indignities that I have suffered

Here is the magistrate said M Baleinier as he caught the sound of
approaching footsteps Beware

The door opened and to the indescribable amazement of the doctor
Rodin appeared on the threshold accompanied by a man dressed in
black with a dignified and severe countenance In the interest of his
projects and from motives of craft and prudence that will hereafter be
known Rodin had not informed Father dAigrigny and consequently
the doctor of the unexpected visit he intended to pay to the asylum
accompanied by a magistrate On the contrary he had only the day before
given orders to M Baleinier to confine Mdlle de Cardoville still more
strictly Therefore imagine the stupor of the doctor when he saw the
judicial officer whose unexpected presence and imposing aspect were
otherwise sufficiently alarming enter the room accompanied by Rodin
Abbe dAigrignys humble and obscure secretary From the door
Rodin who was very shabbily dressed as usual pointed out Mdlle
de Cardoville to the magistrate by a gesture at once respectful and
compassionate Then while the latter who had not been able to repress
a movement of admiration at sight of the rare beauty of Adrienne seemed
to examine her with as much surprise as interest the Jesuit modestly
receded several steps

Dr Baleinier in his extreme astonishment hoping to be understood by
Rodin made suddenly several private signals as if to interrogate him
on the cause of the magistrates visit But this was only productive of
fresh amazement to M Baleinier for Rodin did not appear to recognize
him or to understand his expressive pantomime and looked at him with
affected bewilderment At length as the doctor growing impatient
redoubled his mute questionings Rodin advanced with a stride stretched
forward his crooked neck and said in a loud voice What is your
pleasure doctor

These words which completely disconcerted Baleinier broke the silence
which had reigned for some seconds and the magistrate turned round
Rodin added with imperturbable coolness Since our arrival the doctor
has been making all sorts of mysterious signs to me I suppose he has
something private to communicate but as I have no secrets I must beg
him to speak out loud

This reply so embarrassing for M Baleinier uttered in a tone of
aggression and with an air of icy coldness plunged the doctor into
such new and deep amazement that he remained for some moments without
answering No doubt the magistrate was struck with this incident and
with the silence which followed it for he cast a look of great severity
on the doctor Mdlle de Cardoville who had expected to have seen M de
Montbron was also singularly surprised




CHAPTER XXXIII THE ACCUSER

Baleinier disconcerted for a moment by the unexpected presence of a
magistrate and by Rodins inexplicable attitude soon recovered his
presence of mind and addressing his colleague of the longer robe said
to him If I make signs to you sir it was that while I wished
to respect the silence which this gentlemanglancing at the
magistratehas preserved since his entrance I desired to express my
surprise at the unexpected honor of this visit

It is to the lady that I will explain the reason for my silence and
beg her to excuse it replied the magistrate as he made a halfbow to
Adrienne whom he thus continued to address I have just received
so serious a declaration with regard to you madame that I could not
forbear looking at you for a moment in silence to see if I could read
in your countenance or in your attitude the truth or falsehood of the
accusation that has been placed in my hands and I have every reason to
believe that it is but too well founded

May I at length be informed sir said Dr Baleinier in a polite but
firm tone to whom I have the honor of speaking

Sir I am juge dinstruction and I have come to inform myself as to a
fact which has been pointed out to me

Will you do me the honor to explain yourself sir said the doctor
bowing

Sir resumed the magistrate M de Gernande a man of about fifty
years of age full of firmness and straightforwardness and knowing how
to unite the austere duties of his position with benevolent politeness
you are accused of having committeda very great error not to use a
harsher expression As for the nature of that error I prefer believing
sir that you a first rate man of science may have been deceived in
the calculation of a medical case rather than suspect you of having
forgotten all that is sacred in the exercise of a profession that is
almost a priesthood

When you specify the facts sir answered the Jesuit of the short
robe with a degree of haughtiness it will be easy for me to prove
that my reputation as a man of science is no less free from reproach
than my conscience as a man of honor

Madame said M de Gernande addressing Adrienne is it true that you
were conveyed to this house by stratagem

Sir cried M Baleinier permit me to observe that the manner in
which you open this question is an insult to me

Sir it is to the lady that I have the honor of addressing myself
replied M de Gernande sternly and I am the sole judge of the
propriety of my questions

Adrienne was about to answer affirmatively to the magistrate when an
expressive took from Dr Baleinier reminded her that she would perhaps
expose Dagobert and his son to cruel dangers It was no base and vulgar
feeling of vengeance by which Adrienne was animated but a legitimate
indignation inspired by odious hypocrisy She would have thought it
cowardly not to unmask the criminals but wishing to avoid compromising
others she said to the magistrate with an accent full of mildness and
dignity Permit me sir in my turn rather to ask you a question

Speak madame

Will the answer I make be considered a formal accusation

I have come hither madame to ascertain the truth and no
consideration should induce you to dissemble it

So be it sir resumed Adrienne but suppose having just causes of
complaint I lay them before you in order to be allowed to leave this
house shall I afterwards be at liberty not to press the accusations I
have made

You may abandon proceedings madame but the law will take up your case
in the name of society if its rights have been inured in your person

Shall I then not be allowed to pardon Should I not be sufficiently
avenged by a contemptuous forgetfulness of the wrongs I have suffered

Personally madame you may forgive and forget but I have the honor
to repeat to you that society cannot show the same indulgence if
it should turn out that you have been the victim of a criminal
machinationand I have every reason to fear it is so The manner in
which you express yourself the generosity of your sentiments the
calmness and dignity of your attitude convince me that I have been well
informed

I hope sir said Dr Baleinier recovering his coolness that you
will at least communicate the declaration that has been made to you

It has been declared to me sir said the magistrate in a stern
voice that Mdlle de Cardoville was brought here by stratagem

By stratagem

Yes sir

It is true The lady was brought here by stratagem answered the
Jesuit of the short robe after a moments silence

You confess it then said M de Gernande

Certainly I do sir I admit that I had recourse to means which we are
unfortunately too often obliged to employ when persons who most need
our assistance are unconscious of their own sad state

But sir replied the magistrate it has also been declared to me
that Mdlle de Cardoville never required such aid

That sir is a question of medical jurisprudence which has to be
examined and discussed said M Baleinier recovering his assurance

It will indeed sir be seriously discussed for you are accused of
confining Mdlle De Cardoville while in the full possession of all her
faculties

And may I ask you for what purpose said M de Baleinier with a
slight shrug of the shoulders and in a tone of irony What interest
had I to commit such a crime even admitting that my reputation did not
place me above so odious and absurd a charge

You are said to have acted sir in furtherance of a family plot
devised against Mdlle de Cardoville for a pecuniary motive

And who has dared sir to make so calumnious a charge cried Dr
Baleinier with indignant warmth Who has had the audacity to accuse
a respectable and I dare to say respected man of having been the
accomplice in such infamy

I said Rodin coldly

You cried Dr Baleinier falling back two steps as if thunderstruck

Yes I accuse you repeated Rodin in a clear sharp voice

Yes it was this gentleman who came to me this morning with ample
proofs to demand my interference in favor of Mdlle de Cardoville
said the magistrate drawing back a little to give Adrienne the
opportunity of seeing her defender

Throughout this scene Rodins name had not hitherto been mentioned
Mdlle de Cardoville had often heard speak of the Abbe dAigrignys
secretary in no very favorable terms but never having seen him she
did not know that her liberator was this very Jesuit She therefore
looked towards him with a glance in which were mingled curiosity
interest surprise and gratitude Rodins cadaverous countenance his
repulsive ugliness his sordid dress would a few days before have
occasioned Adrienne a perhaps invincible feeling of disgust But the
young lady remembering how the sempstress poor feeble deformed
and dressed almost in rags was endowed notwithstanding her wretched
exterior with one of the noblest and most admirable hearts recalled
this recollection in favor of the Jesuit She forgot that he was ugly
and sordid only to remember that he was old that he seemed poor and
that he had come to her assistance Dr Baleinier notwithstanding his
craft notwithstanding his audacious hypocrisy in spite even of his
presence of mind could not conceal how much he was disturbed by Rodins
denunciation His head became troubled as he remembered how on the
first day of Adriennes confinement in this house the implacable appeal
of Rodin through the hole in the door had prevented him Baleinier
from yielding to emotions of pity inspired by the despair of this
unfortunate young girl driven almost to doubt of her own reason And
yet it was this very Rodin so cruel so inexorable the devoted agent
of Father dAigrigny who denounced him Baleinier and brought a
magistrate to set Adrienne at libertywhen only the day before Father
dAigrigny had ordered an increase of severity towards her

The lay Jesuit felt persuaded that Rodin was betraying Father dAigrigny
in the most shameful manner and that Mdlle de Cardovilles friends had
bribed and bought over this scoundrelly secretary Exasperated by what
he considered a monstrous piece of treachery the doctor exclaimed in a
voice broken with rage And it is you sir that have the impudence to
accuse meyou who only a few days ago

Then reflecting that the retort upon Rodin would be selfaccusation
he appeared to give way to an excess of emotion and resumed with
bitterness Ah sir you are the last person that I should have thought
capable of this odious denunciation It is shameful

And who had a better right than I to denounce this infamy answered
Rodin in a rude overbearing tone Was I not in a position to
learnunfortunately too latethe nature of the conspiracy of which
Mdlle de Cardoville and others have been the victims Then what was
my duty as an honest man Why to inform the magistrate to prove what I
set forth and to accompany him hither That is what I have done

So sir said the doctor addressing the magistrate it is not only
myself that this man accuses but he dares also

I accuse the Abbe dAigrigny resumed Rodin in a still louder and
more imperative tone interrupting the doctor I accuse the Princess de
SaintDizier I accuse you sirof having from a vile motive of self
interest confined Mdlle de Cardoville in this house and the two
daughters of Marshal Simon in the neighboring convent Is that clear

Alas it is only too true said Adrienne hastily I have seen those
poor children all in tears making signs of distress to me

The accusation of Rodin with regard to the orphans was a new and
fearful blow for Dr Baleinier He felt perfectly convinced that the
traitor had passed clear over to the enemys camp Wishing therefore to
put an end to this embarrassing scene he tried to put a good face on
the matter in spite of his emotion and said to the magistrate

I might confine myself sir to silencedisdaining to answer such
accusations till a judicial decision had given them some kind of
authority But strong in a good conscience I address myself to Mdlle
de Cardoville and I beg her to say if this very morning I did not
inform her that her health would soon be sufficiently restored to allow
her to leave this house I conjure her in the name of her wellknown
love of truth to state if such was not my language when I was alone
with her

Come sir said Rodin interrupting Baleinier with an insolent air
suppose that from pure generosity this dear young lady were to admit
as muchwhat will it prove in your favorwhy nothing at all

What sir cried the doctor do you presume

I presume to unmask you without asking your leave What have you just
told us Why that being alone with Mdlle de Cardoville you talked to
her as if she were really mad How very conclusive

But sir cried the doctor

But sir resumed Rodin without allowing him to continue it is
evident that foreseeing the possibility of what has occurred today
and to provide yourself with a hole to creep out at you have pretended
to believe your own execrable falsehood in presence of this poor young
lady that you might afterwards call in aid the evidence of your own
assumed conviction Come sir such stories will not go down with people
of common sense or common humanity

Come now sir exclaimed Baleinier angrily

Well sir resumed Rodin in a still louder voice which completely
drowned that of the doctor is it true or is it not that you have
recourse to the mean evasion of ascribing this odious imprisonment to a
scientific error I affirm that you do so and that you think yourself
safe because you can now say Thanks to my care the young lady has
recovered her reason What more would you have

Yes I do say that sir and I maintain it

You maintain a falsehood for it is proven that the lady never lost her
reason for a moment

But I sir maintain that she did lose it

And I sir will prove the contrary said Rodin

You How will you do that cried the doctor

That I shall take care not to tell you at present as you may
well suppose answered Rodin with an ironical smile adding with
indignation But really sir you ought to die for shame to dare to
raise such a question in presence of the lady You should at least have
spared her this discussion

Sir

Oh fie sir I say fie It is odious to maintain this argument before
herodious if you speak truth doubly odious if you lie said Rodin
with disgust

This violence is inconceivable cried the Jesuit of the short robe
exasperated and I think the magistrate shows great partiality in
allowing such gross calumnies to be heaped upon me

Sir answered M de Gernande severely I am entitled not only to
hear but to provoke any contradictory discussion that may enlighten
me in the execution of my duty it results from all this that even in
your opinion sir Mdlle de Cardovilles health is sufficiently good to
allow her to return home immediately

At least I do not see any very serious inconvenience likely to arise
from it sir said the doctor only I maintain that the cure is not
so complete as it might have been and on this subject I decline all
responsibility for the future

You can do so safely said Rodin it is not likely that the young
lady will ever again have recourse to your honest assistance

It is useless therefore to employ my official authority to demand
the immediate liberation of Mdlle de Cardoville said the magistrate

She is free said Baleinier perfectly free

As for the question whether you have imprisoned her on the plea of a
suppositious madness the law will inquire into it sir and you will be
heard

I am quite easy sir answered M Baleinier trying to look so my
conscience reproaches me with nothing

I hope it may turn out well sir said M de Gernande However bad
appearances may be more especially when persons of your station in
society are concerned we should always wish to be convinced of their
innocence Then turning to Adrienne he added I understand madame
how painful this scene must be to all your feelings of delicacy and
generosity hereafter it will depend upon yourself either to proceed
for damages against M Baleinier or to let the law take its course
One word more The bold and upright manhere the magistrate pointed
to Rodinwho has taken up your cause in so frank and disinterested a
manner expressed a belief that you would perhaps take charge for the
present of Marshal Simons daughters whose liberation I am about to
demand from the convent where they also are confined by stratagem

The fact is sir replied Adrienne that as soon as I learned the
arrival of Marshal Simons daughters in Paris my intention was to offer
them apartments in my house These young ladies are my near relations
It is at once a duty and a pleasure for me to treat them as sisters I
shall therefore be doubly grateful to you sir if you will trust them
to my care

I think that I cannot serve them better answered M de Gernande
Then addressing Baleinier he added Will you consent sir to my
bringing these two ladies hither I will go and fetch them while Mdlle
de Cardoville prepares for her departure They will then be able to
leave this house with their relation

I entreat the lady to make use of this house as her own until she
leaves it replied M Baleinier My carriage shall be at her orders to
take her home

Madame said the magistrate approaching Adrienne without prejudging
the question which must soon be decided by a court of law I may at
least regret that I was not called in sooner Your situation must have
been a very cruel one

There will at least remain to me sir from this mournful time
said Adrienne with graceful dignity one precious and touching
remembrancethat of the interest which you have shown me I hope that
you will one day permit me to thank you at my own home not for the
justice you have done me but for the benevolent and paternal manner in
which you have done it And moreover sir added Mdlle de Cardoville
with a sweet smile I should like to prove to you that what they call
my cure is complete

M de Gernande bowed respectfully in reply During the abort dialogue of
the magistrate with Adrienne their backs were both turned to Baleinier
and Rodin The latter profiting by this moments opportunity hastily
slipped into the doctors hand a note just written with a pencil in the
bottom of his hat Baleinier looked at Rodin in stupefied amazement But
the latter made a peculiar sign by raising his thumb to his forehead
and drawing it twice across his brow Then he remained impassible This
had passed so rapidly that when M de Gernande turned round Rodin was
at a distance of several steps from Dr Baleinier and looking at Mdlle
de Cardoville with respectful interest

Permit me to accompany you sir said the doctor preceding the
magistrate whom Mdlle de Cardoville saluted with much affability Then
both went out and Rodin remained alone with the young lady

After conducting M de Gernande to the outer door of the house M
Baleinier made haste to read the pencilnote written by Rodin it ran as
follows The magistrate is going to the convent by way of the street
Run round by the garden and tell the Superior to obey the order I
have given with regard to the two young girls It is of the utmost
importance

The peculiar sign which Rodin had made and the tenor of this note
proved to Dr Baleinier who was passing from surprise to amazement
that the secretary far from betraying the reverend father was still
acting for the Greater Glory of the Lord However whilst he obeyed the
orders M Baleinier sought in vain to penetrate the motives of Rodins
inexplicable conduct who had himself informed the authorities of an
affair that was to have been hushed up and that might have the most
disastrous consequences for Father dAigrigny Madame de SaintDizier
and Baleinier himself But let us return to Rodin left alone with
Mdlle de Cardoville




CHAPTER XXXIV FATHER DAIGRIGNYS SECRETARY

Hardly had the magistrate and Dr Baleinier disappeared than Mdlle de
Cardoville whose countenance was beaming with joy exclaimed as she
looked at Rodin with a mixture of respect and gratitude At length
thanks to you sir I am freefree Oh I had never before felt
how much happiness expansion delight there is in that adorable
wordliberty

Her bosom rose and fell her rosy nostrils dilated her vermilion lips
were half open as if she again inhaled with rapture pure and vivifying
air

I have been only a few days in this horrible place she resumed but
I have suffered enough from my captivity to make me resolve never to let
a year pass without restoring to liberty some poor prisoners for debt
This vow no doubt appears to belong a little to the Middle Ages
added she with a smile but I would fain borrow from that noble epoch
something more than its old windows and furniture So doubly thanks
sirfor I take you as a partner in that project of deliverance which
has just you see unfolded itself in the midst of the happiness I owe
to you and by which you seem so much affected Oh let my joy speak my
gratitude and pay you for your generous aid exclaimed the young girl
with enthusiasm

Mdlle de Cardoville had truly remarked a complete transfiguration in
the countenance of Rodin This man lately so harsh severe inflexible
with regard to Dr Baleinier appeared now under the influence of the
mildest and most tender sentiments His little halfveiled eyes were
fixed upon Adrienne with an expression of ineffable interest Then as
if he wished to tear himself from these impressions he said speaking
to himself Come come no weakness Time is too precious my mission
is not fulfilled My dear young lady added he addressing himself to
Adrienne believe what I saywe will talk hereafter of gratitudebut
we have now to talk of the present so important for you and your family
Do you know what is taking place

Adrienne looked at the Jesuit with surprise and said What is taking
place sir

Do you know the real motive of your imprisonment in this house Do you
know what influenced the Princess de SaintDizier and Abbe dAigrigny

At the sound of those detested names Mdlle de Cardovilles face
now so full of happiness became suddenly sad and she answered with
bitterness It is hatred sir that no doubt animated Madame de
SaintDizier against me

Yes hatred and moreover the desire to rob you with impunity of an
immense fortune

Me sir how

You must be ignorant my dear young lady of the interest you had to be
in the Rue SaintFrancois on the 13th February for an inheritance

I was ignorant sir of the date and details but I knew by some family
papers and thanks to an extraordinary circumstance that one of our
ancestors

Had left an enormous sum to be divided between his descendants is it
not so

Yes sir

But what unfortunately you did not know my dear young lady was that
the heirs were all bound to be present at a certain hour on the 13th
February This day and hour once past the absent would forfeit their
claim Do you now understand why you have been imprisoned here my dear
young lady

Yes yes I understand it cried Mdlle de Cardoville cupidity was
added to the hatred which my aunt felt for me All is explained Marshal
Simons daughters having the same right as I had have like me been
imprisoned

And yet cried Rodin you and they were not the only victims

Who then are the others sir

A young East Indian

Prince Djalma said Adrienne hastily

For the same reason he has been nearly poisoned with a narcotic

Great God cried the young girl clasping her hands in horror It is
fearful That young prince who was said to have so noble and generous a
character But I had sent to Cardoville Castle

A confidential person to fetch the prince to ParisI know it my dear
young lady but by means of a trick your friend was got out of the
way and the young Oriental delivered to his enemies

And where is he now

I have only vague information on the subject I know that he is in
Paris and do not despair of finding him I shall pursue my researches
with an almost paternal ardor for we cannot too much love the rare
qualities of that poor kings son What a heart my dear young lady
what a heart Oh it is a heart of gold pure and bright as the gold of
his country

We must find the prince sir said Adrienne with emotion let me
entreat you to neglect nothing for that end He is my relationalone
herewithout supportwithout assistance

Certainly replied Rodin with commiseration Poor boyfor he is
almost a boyeighteen or nineteen years of agethrown into the
heart of Paris of this hellwith his fresh ardent halfsavage
passionswith his simplicity and confidenceto what perils may he not
be exposed

Well we must first find him sir said Adrienne hastily and then
we will save him from these dangers Before I was confined here I
learned his arrival in France and sent a confidential person to offer
him the services of an unknown friend I now see that this mad idea
with which I have been so much reproached was a very sensible one I am
more convinced of it than ever The prince belongs to my family and
I owe him a generous hospitality I had destined for him the lodge I
occupied at my aunts

And you my dear young lady

Today I shall remove to a house which I had prepared some time ago
with the determination of quitting Madame de SaintDizier and living
alone as I pleased Then sir as you seem bent upon being the good
genius of our family be as generous with regard to Prince Djalma as
you have been to me and Marshal Simons daughters I entreat you to
discover the hidingplace of this poor kings son as you call him keep
my secret for me and conduct him to the house offered by the unknown
friend Let him not disquiet himself about anything all his wants shall
be provided for he shall livelike a prince

Yes he will indeed live like a prince thanks to your royal
munificence But never was such kind interest better deserved It is
enough to see as I have seen his fine melancholy countenance

You have seen him then sir said Adrienne interrupting Rodin

Yes my dear young lady I was with him for about two hours It was
quite enough to judge of him His charming features are the mirror of
his soul

And where did you see him sir

At your old Chateau de Cardoville my dear young lady near which he
had been shipwrecked in a storm and whither I had gone to Rodin
hesitated for a moment and then as if yielding to the frankness of
his disposition added Whither I had gone to commit a bad actiona
shameful miserable action I must confess

You sirat Cardoville Houseto commit a bad action cried
Adrienne much surprised

Alas yes my dear young lady answered Rodin with simplicity In one
word I had orders from Abbe dAigrigny to place your former bailiff in
the alternative either of losing his situation or lending himself to a
mean actionsomething in fact that resembled spying and calumny but
the honest worthy man refused

Why who are you sir said Mdlle de Cardoville more and more
astonished

I am Rodin lately secretary of the Abbe dAigrignya person of very
little importance as you see

It is impossible to describe the accent at once humble and ingenuous
of the Jesuit as he pronounced these words which he accompanied with
a respectful bow On this revelation Mdlle de Cardoville drew back
abruptly We have said that Adrienne had sometimes heard talk of Rodin
the humble secretary of the Abbe dAigrigny as a sort of obedient and
passive machine That was not all the bailiff of Cardoville Manor
writing to Adrienne on the subject of Prince Djalma had complained of
the perfidious and dishonest propositions of Rodin She felt therefore
a vague suspicion when she heard that her liberator was the man who had
played so odious a part Yet this unfavorable feeling was balanced by
the sense of what she owed to Rodin and by his frank denunciation of
Abbe dAigrigny before the magistrate And then the Jesuit by his own
confession had anticipated as it were the reproaches that might have
been addressed to him Still it was with a kind of cold reserve that
Mdlle de Cardoville resumed this dialogue which she had commenced with
as much frankness as warmth and sympathy

Rodin perceived the impression he had made He expected it He was not
the least disconcerted when Mdlle de Cardoville said to him as she
fixed upon him a piercing glance Ah you are M Rodinsecretary to
the Abbe dAigrigny

Say exsecretary if you please my dear young lady answered the
Jesuit for you see clearly that I can never again enter the house of
the Abbe dAigrigny I have made of him an implacable enemy and I am
now without employmentbut no matternay so much the bettersince
at this price the wicked are unmasked and honest people rescued

These words spoken with much simplicity and dignity revived a feeling
of pity in Adriennes heart She thought within herself that after all
the poor old man spoke the truth Abbe dAigrignys hate after this
exposure would be inexorable and Rodin had braved it for the sake of a
generous action

Still Mdlle de Cardoville answered coldly Since you knew sir that
the propositions you were charged to make to the bailiff of Cardoville
were shameful and perfidious how could you undertake the mission

How replied Rodin with a sort of painful impatience why because
I was completely under Abbe dAigrignys charm one of the most
prodigiously clever men I have ever known and as I only discovered the
day before yesterday one of the most prodigiously dangerous men there
is in the world He had conquered my scruples by persuading me that
the End justifies the Means I must confess that the end he seemed to
propose to himself was great and beautiful but the day before yesterday
I was cruelly undeceived I was awakened as it were by a thunderpeal
Oh my dear young lady added Rodin with a sort of embarrassment
and confusion let us talk no more of my fatal journey to Cardoville
Though I was only an ignorant and blind instrument I feel as ashamed
and grieved at it as if I had acted for myself It weighs upon me it
oppresses me I entreat you let us speak rather of yourself and of
what interests youfor the soul expands with generous thoughts even as
the breast is dilated in pure and healthful air

Rodin had confessed his fault so spontaneously he explained it so
naturally he appeared to regret it so sincerely that Adrienne
whose suspicions had no other grounds felt her distrust a good deal
diminished

So she resumed still looking attentively at Rodin it was at
Cardoville that you saw Prince Djalma

Yes madame and my affection for him dates from that interview
Therefore I will accomplish my task Be satisfied my dear young lady
like you like Marshal Simons daughters the prince shall avoid being
the victim of this detestable plot which unhappily does not stop
there

And who besides then is threatened

M Hardy a man full of honor and probity who is also your relation
and interested in this inheritance but kept away from Paris by infamous
treachery And another heir an unfortunate artisan who falling into a
trap cleverly baited has been thrown into a prison for debt

But sir said Adrienne suddenly for whose advantage was this
abominable plot which really alarms me first devised

For the advantage of Abbe dAigrigny answered Rodin

How and by what right Was he also an heir

It would take too long to explain it to you my dear young lady You
will know all one day Only be convinced that your family has no more
bitter enemy that Abbe dAigrigny

Sir said Adrienne giving way to one last suspicion I will speak
frankly to you How can I have deserved the interest that you seem to
take in me and that you even extend to all the members of my family

My dear young lady answered Rodin with a smile were I to tell you
the cause you would only laugh at or misapprehend me

Speak I beg of you sir Do not mistrust me or yourself

Well then I became interested in youdevoted to youbecause your
heart is generous your mind lofty your character independent and
proud Once attached to you those of your race who are indeed
themselves worthy of interest were no longer indifferent to me To
serve them was to serve you also

But siradmitting that you suppose me worthy of the too flattering
praises you bestow upon mehow could you judge of my heart my mind my
character

I will tell you my dear young lady but first I must make another
confession that fills me with shame If you were not even so
wonderfully endowed what you have suffered in this house should suffice
to command the interest of every honest mandont you think so

I do think it should sir

I might thus explain the interest I feel in you But noI confess
itthat would not have sufficed with me Had you been only Mdlle de
Cardovillea rich noble beautiful young ladyI should doubtless have
pitied your misfortune but I should have said to myself This poor
young lady is certainly much to be pitied but what can I poor man do
in it My only resource is my post of secretary to the Abbe dAigrigny
and he would be the first that must be attacked He is allpowerful and
I am nothing To engage in a struggle with him would be to ruin myself
without the hope of saving this unfortunate person But when I
learnt what you were my dear young lady I revolted in spite of my
inferiority No I said a thousand times no So fine an intellect
so great a heart shall not be the victims of an abominable plot I may
perish in the struggle but I will at least make the attempt

No words can paint the mixture of delicacy energy and sensibility with
which Rodin uttered these sentiments As it often happens with people
singularly repulsive and illfavored if they can once bring you to
forget their ugliness their very deformity becomes a source of interest
and commiseration and you say to yourself What a pity that such a
mind such a soul should inhabit so poor a bodyand you are touched
and softened by the contrast

It was thus that Mdlle de Cardoville began to look upon Rodin He had
shown himself as simple and affectionate towards her as he had been
brutal and insolent to Dr Baleinier One thing only excited the lively
curiosity of Mdlle de Cardovilleshe wished to know how Rodin had
conceived the devotion and admiration which she seemed to inspire

Forgive my indiscreet and obstinate curiosity sir but I wish to
know

How you were morally revealed to meis it not so Oh my dear young
lady nothing is more simple I will explain it to you in two words
The Abbe dAigrigny saw in me nothing but a writingmachine an obtuse
mute blind instrument

I thought M dAigrigny had more penetration

And you are right my dear young lady he is a man of unparalleled
sagacity but I deceived him by affecting more than simplicity Do not
therefore think me false No I am proud in my mannerand my pride
consists in never appearing above my position however subaltern it may
be Do you know why It is that however haughty may be my superiors I
can say to myself They do not know my value It is the inferiority of
my condition not me that they humiliate By this I gain doublymy
selflove is spared and I hate no one

Yes I understand that sort of pride said Adrienne more and more
struck with Rodins original turn of mind

But let us return to what concerns you my dear young lady On the eve
of the 13th of February the Abbe dAigrigny delivered to me a paper
in shorthand and said to me Transcribe this examination you may
add that it is to support the decision of a family council which has
declared in accordance with the report of Dr Baleinier the state of
mind of Mdlle de Cardoville to be sufficiently alarming to render it
necessary to confine her in a lunatic asylum

Yes said Adrienne with bitterness it related to a long interview
which I had with the Princess de SaintDizier my aunt and which was
taken down without my knowledge

Behold me then poring over my shorthand report and beginning to
transcribe it At the end of the first ten lines I was struck with
stupor I knew not if I were awake or dreaming What mad They must
be themselves insane who dare assert so monstrous a propositionMore
and more interested I continued my readingI finished itOh then
what shall I say What I felt my dear young lady it is impossible to
express It was sympathy delight enthusiasm

Sir said Adrienne

Yes my dear young lady enthusiasm Let not the words shock your
modesty Know that these ideas so new so independent so courageous
which you expressed to your aunt with so much brilliancy are without
your being aware of it common to you and another person for whom you
will one day feel the most tender and religious respect

Of whom do you speak sir cried Mdlle de Cardoville more and more
interested

After a moments apparent hesitation Rodin resumed No noit is
useless now to inform you of it All I can tell you my dear young lady
is that when I had finished my reading I ran to Abbe dAigrignys to
convince him of the error into which he had fallen with regard to you
It was impossible then to find him but yesterday morning I told him
plainly what I thought He only appeared surprised to find that I could
think at all He received my communications with contemptuous silence
I thought him deceived I continued my remonstrances but quite in vain
He ordered me to follow him to the house where the testament of your
ancestor was to be opened I was so blind with regard to the Abbe
dAigrigny that it required the successive arrivals of the soldier
of his son and of Marshal Simons father to open my eyes thoroughly
Their indignation unveiled to me the extent of a conspiracy plotted
long ago and carried on with terrible ability Then I understood why
you were confined here as a lunatic why the daughters of Marshal Simon
were imprisoned in a convent Then a thousand recollections returned to
my mind fragments of letters and statements which had been given me
to copy or decipher and of which I had never been able to find the
explanation put me on the track of this odious machination To express
then and there the sudden horror I felt at these crimes would have been
to ruin all I did not make this mistake I opposed cunning to cunning
I appeared even more eager than Abbe dAigrigny Had this immense
inheritance been destined for me alone I could not have shown myself
more grasping and merciless Thanks to this stratagem Abbe dAigrigny
had no suspicion A providential accident having rescued the inheritance
from his hands he left the house in a state of profound consternation
For my part I felt indescribable joy for I had now the means of saving
and avenging you my dear young lady As usual I went yesterday evening
to my place of business During the absence of the abbe it was easy for
me to peruse the correspondence relative to the inheritance In this way
I was able to unite all the threads of this immense plot Oh then
my dear young lady I remained struck with horror in presence of the
discoveries that I made and that I never should have made under any
other circumstances

What discoveries sir

There are some secrets which are terrible to those who possess them Do
not ask me to explain my dear young lady but in this examination the
league formed against you and your relations from motives of insatiable
cupidity appeared to me in all its dark audacity Thereupon the lively
and deep interest which I already felt for you my dear young lady was
augmented greatly and extended itself to the other innocent victims of
this infernal conspiracy In spite of my weakness I determined to risk
all to unmask the Abbe dAigrigny I collected the necessary proofs
to give my declaration before the magistrate the needful authority
and this morning I left the abbes house without revealing to him my
projects He might have employed some violent method to detain me yet
it would have been cowardly to attack him without warning Once out of
his house I wrote to him that I had in my hands proof enough of his
crimes to attack him openly in the face of day I would accuse and he
must defend himself I went directly to a magistrate and you know the
rest

At this juncture the door opened and one of the nurses appeared and
said to Rodin Sir the messenger that you and the magistrate sent to
the Rue BriseMiche has just come back

Has he left the letter

Yes sir and it was taken upstairs directly

Very well Leave us The nurse went out




CHAPTER XXXV SYMPATHY

If it had been possible for Mdlle de Cardoville to harbor any suspicion
of the sincerity of Rodins devotion it must have given way before this
reasoning unfortunately so simple and undeniable How could she suppose
the faintest complicity between the Abbe dAigrigny and his secretary
when it was the latter who completely unveiled the machinations of his
master and exposed them to the tribunals when in this Rodin went
even further than Mdlle de Cardoville would herself have gone Of what
secret design could she suspect the Jesuit At worst of a desire to
earn by his services the profitable patronage of the young lady

And then had he not just now protested against this supposition by
declaring his devotion not to Mdlle de Cardovillenot to the fair
rich noble ladybut to the highsouled and generous girl Finally
as Rodin had said himself could any but a miserable wretch fail to be
interested in Adriennes fate A strange mixture of curiosity surprise
and interest was joined with Mdlle de Cardovilles feelings of
gratitude towards Rodin Yet as she recognized the superior mind under
that humble exterior she was suddenly struck with a grave suspicion
Sir said she to Rodin I always confess to the persons I esteem the
doubts they may have inspired so that they may justify themselves and
excuse me if I am wrong

Rodin looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with surprise as if mentally
calculating the suspicions than she might entertain and replied
after a moments silence You are perhaps thinking of my journey to
Cardoville of my base proposals to your good and worthy bailiff Oh if
you

No no sir said Adrienne interrupting him you made that
confession spontaneously and I quite understand that blinded with
regard to M dAigrigny you passively executed instructions repugnant
to your delicacy But how comes it that with your incontestable
merits you have so long occupied so mean a position in his service

It is true said Rodin with a smile that must impress you
unfavorably my dear young lady for a man of any capacity who remains
long in an inferior condition has evidently some radical vice some bad
or base passion

It is generally true sir

And personally truewith regard to myself

What sir do you make this avowal

Alas I confess that I have a bad passion to which for forty years I
have sacrificed all chances of attaining to a better position

And this passion sir

Since I must make the unpleasant avowal this passion is
indolenceyes indolencethe horror of all activity of mind of all
moral responsibility of taking the lead in anything With the twelve
hundred francs that Abbe dAigrigny gave me I was the happiest man in
the world I trusted to the nobleness of his views his thoughts became
mine his wishes mine My work once finished I returned to my poor
little chamber I lighted my fire I dined on vegetablesthen taking
up some book of philosophy little known and dreaming over it I gave
free course to my imagination which restrained all the day long
carried me through numberless theories to a delicious Utopia Then from
the eminences of my intelligence lifted up Lord knows whither by the
audacity of my thoughts I seemed to look down upon my master and upon
the great men of the earth This fever lasted for three or four hours
after which I had a good sleep and the next morning I went lightly to
my work secure of my daily bread without cares for the future living
content with little waiting with impatience for the delights of my
solitary evening and saying to myself as I went on writing like a
stupid machine And yetand yetif I chose

Doubtless you could like others surer than others have reached a
higher position said Adrienne greatly struck with Rodins practical
philosophy

Yes I think I could have done so but for what purposeYou see my
dear young lady what often renders people of some merit puzzles to the
vulgar is that they are frequently content to say If I chose

But sir without attaching much importance to the luxuries of
life there is a certain degree of comfort which age renders almost
indispensable and which you seem to have utterly renounced

Undeceive yourself if you please my dear young lady said Rodin
with a playful smile I am a true Sybarite I require absolutely warm
clothes a good stove a soft mattress a good piece of bread a fresh
radish flavored with good cheap salt and some good clear water and
notwithstanding this complication of wants my twelve hundred francs
have always more than sufficed for I have been able to make some little
savings

But now that you are without employment how will you manage to live
sir said Adrienne more and more interested by the singularities of
this man and wishing to put his disinterestedness to the proof

I have laid by a little which will serve me till I have unravelled
the last thread of Father dAigrignys dark designs I owe myself this
reparation for having been his dupe three or four days I hope will
complete the work After that I have the certainty of meeting with a
situation in my native province under a collector of taxes some
time ago the offer was made me by a friend but then I would not leave
Father dAigrigny notwithstanding the advantages proposed Fancy my
dear young ladyeight hundred francs with board and lodging As I am
a little of the roughest I should have preferred lodging apart but as
they give me so much I must submit to this little inconvenience

Nothing could exceed Rodins ingenuity in making these little household
confidences so abominably false to Mdlle de Cardoville who felt her
last suspicions give way

What sir said she to the Jesuit with interest in three or four
days you mean to quit Paris

I hope to do so my dear young lady and that added he in a
mysterious tone and that for many reasons But what would be very
precious to me he resumed in a serious voice as he looked at
Adrienne with emotion would be to carry with me the conviction
that you did me the justice to believe that on merely reading your
interview with the Princess de SaintDizier I recognized at once
qualities quite unexampled in our day in a young person of your age and
condition

Ah sir said Adrienne with a smile do not think yourself
obliged to return so soon the sincere praises that I bestowed on your
superiority of mind I should be better pleased with ingratitude

Oh no I do not flatter you my dear young lady Why should I We
may probably never meet again I do not flatter you I understand
youthats alland what will seem strange to you is that your
appearance complete the idea which I had already formed of you my dear
young lady in reading your interview with your aunt and some parts of
your character hitherto obscure to me are now fully displayed

Really sir you astonish me more and more

I cant help it I merely describe my impressions I can now explain
perfectly for example your passionate love of the beautiful your
eager worship of the refinements of the senses your ardent aspirations
for a better state of things your courageous contempt of many degrading
and servile customs to which woman is condemned yes now I
understand the noble pride with which you contemplate the mob of vain
selfsufficient ridiculous men who look upon woman as a creature
destined for their service according to the laws made after their own
not very handsome image In the eyes of these hedgetyrants woman a
kind of inferior being to whom a council of cardinals deigned to grant a
soul by a majority of two voices ought to think herself supremely happy
in being the servant of these petty pachas old at thirty wornout
used up weary with excesses wishing only for repose and seeking as
they say to make an end of it which they set about by marrying some
poor girl who is on her side desirous to make a beginning

Mdlle de Cardoville would certainly have smiled at these satirical
remarks if she had not been greatly struck by hearing Rodin express in
such appropriate terms her own ideas though it was the first time in
her life that she saw this dangerous man Adrienne forgot or
rather she was not aware that she had to deal with a Jesuit of rare
intelligence uniting the information and the mysterious resources of
the policespy with the profound sagacity of the confessor one of those
diabolic priests who by the help of a few hints avowals letters
reconstruct a character as Cuvier could reconstruct a body from
zoological fragments Far from interrupting Rodin Adrienne listened
to him with growing curiosity Sure of the effect he produced he
continued in a tone of indignation And your aunt and the Abbe
dAigrigny treated you as mad because you revolted against the yoke of
such tyrants because hating the shameful vices of slavery you chose
to be independent with the suitable qualities of independence free with
the proud virtues of liberty

But sir said Adrienne more and more surprised how can my thoughts
be so familiar to you

First I know you perfectly thanks to your interview with the Princess
de SaintDizier and next if it should happen that we both pursue the
same end though by different means resumed Rodin artfully as he
looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with an air of intelligence why should
not our convictions be the same

I do not understand you sir Of what end do you speak

The end pursued incessantly by all lofty generous independent
spiritssome acting like you my dear young lady from passion from
instinct without perhaps explaining to themselves the high mission they
are called on to ful fil Thus for example when you take pleasure
in the most refined delights when you surround yourself with all that
charms the senses do you think that you only yield to the attractions
of the beautiful to the desire of exquisite enjoyments No ah no for
then you would be incomplete odiously selfish a dry egotist with a
fine tastenothing moreand at your age it would be hideous my dear
young lady it would be hideous

And do you really think thus severely of me said Adrienne with
uneasiness so much influence had this man irresistibly attained over
her

Certainly I should think thus of you if you loved luxury for luxurys
sake but noquite another sentiment animates you resumed the
Jesuit Let us reason a little Feeling a passionate desire for all
these enjoyments you know their value and their need more than any
oneis it not so

It is so replied Adrienne deeply interested

Your gratitude and favor are then necessarily acquired by those who
poor laborious and unknown have procured for you these marvels of
luxury which you could not do without

This feeling of gratitude is so strong in me sir replied Adrienne
more and more pleased to find herself so well understood that I once
had inscribed on a masterpiece of goldsmiths work instead of the name
of the seller that of the poor unknown artist who designed it and who
has since risen to his true place

There you see I was not deceived went on Rodin the taste for
enjoyment renders you grateful to those who procure it for you and
that is not all here am I an example neither better nor worse than my
neighbors but accustomed to privations which cause me no sufferingso
that the privations of others necessarily touch me less nearly than they
do you my dear young lady for your habits of comfort must needs render
you more compassionate towards misfortune You would yourself suffer too
much from poverty not to pity and succor those who are its victims

Really sir said Adrienne who began to feel herself under the fatal
charm of Rodin the more I listen to you the more I am convinced that
you would defend a thousand times better than I could those ideas for
which I was so harshly reproached by Madame de SaintDizier and
Abbe dAigrigny Oh speak speak sir I cannot tell you with what
happiness with what pride I listen

Attentive and moved her eyes fixed on the Jesuit with as much interest
as sympathy and curiosity Adrienne by a graceful toss of the head that
was habitual to her threw hack her long golden curls the better to
contemplate Rodin who thus resumed You are astonished my dear young
lady that you were not understood by your aunt or by Abbe dAigrigny
What point of contact had you with these hypocritical jealous crafty
minds such as I can judge them to be now Do you wish a new proof of
their hateful blindness Among what they called your monstrous follies
which was the worst the most damnable Why your resolution to live
alone and in your own way to dispose freely of the present and the
future They declared this to be odious detestable immoral And
yetwas this resolution dictated by a mad love of liberty noby
a disordered aversion to all restraint noby the desire of
singularitynofor then I too should have blamed you severely

Other reasons have indeed guided me sir I assure you said Adrienne
eagerly for she had become very eager for the esteem with which her
character might inspire Rodin

Oh I know it well your motives could only be excellent ones replied
the Jesuit Why then did you take this resolution so much called in
question Was it to brave established etiquette no for you respected
them until the hate of Mme de SaintDizier forced you to withdraw
yourself from her unbearable guardianship Was it to live alone to
escape the eyes of the world no you would be a hundred times more open
to observation in this than any other condition Was it to make a bad
use of your liberty no ah no those who design evil seek for darkness
and solitude while you place yourself right before the jealous
anal envious eyes of the vulgar crowd Why then do you take this
determination so courageous and rare unexampled in a young person of
your age Shall I tell you my dear young lady It is that you wish to
prove by your example that a woman of pure heart and honest mind with
a firm character and independence of soul may nobly and proudly throw
off the humiliating guardianship that custom has imposed upon her Yes
instead of accepting the fate of a revolted slave a life only destined
to hypocrisy or vice you wish to live freely in presence of all the
world independent honorable and respected You wish to have like
man the exercise of your own free will the entire responsibility
of all your actions so as to establish the fact that a woman left
completely to herself may equal man in reason wisdom uprightness and
surpass him indelicacy and dignity That is your design my dear young
lady It is noble and great Will your example be imitated I hope it
may but whether it be so or not your generous attempt believe me
will place you in a high and worthy position

Mdlle de Cardovilles eyes shone with a proud and gentle brightness
her cheeks were slightly colored her bosom heaved she raised her
charming head with a movement of involuntary pride at length completely
under the charm of that diabolical man she exclaimed But sir who are
you that can thus know and analyze my most secret thoughts and read
my soul more clearly than myself so as to give new life and action to
those ideas of independence which have long stirred within me Who are
you that can thus elevate me in my own eyes for now I am conscious of
accomplishing a mission honorable to myself and perhaps useful to my
sisters immersed in slavery Once again sir who are you

Who am I madame answered Rodin with a smile of the greatest good
nature I have already told you that I am a poor old man who for the
last forty years having served in the day time as a writing machine to
record the ideas of others went home every evening to work out ideas of
his owna good kind of man who from his garret watches and even takes
some little share in the movement of generous spirits advancing towards
an end that is nearer than is commonly thought And thus my dear young
lady as I told you just now you and I are both tending towards the
same objects though you may do the same without reflection and merely
in obedience to your rare and divine instincts So continue so to live
fair free and happyit is your missionmore providential than you
may think it Yes continue to surround yourself with all the marvels of
luxury and art refine your senses purify your tastes by the exquisite
choice of your enjoyments by genius grace and purity raise yourself
above the stupid and illfavored mob of men that will instantly
surround you when they behold you alone and free they will consider
you an easy prey destined to please their cupidity their egotism
their folly

Laugh at them and mock these idiotic and sordid pretensions Be
the queen of your own world and make yourself respected as a queen
Loveshineenjoyit is your part upon earth All the flowers with
which you are whelmed in profusion will one day bear fruit You think
that you have lived only for pleasure in reality you will have lived
for the noblest aims that could tempt a great and lofty soul And
sosome years hencewe may meet again perhaps you fairer and more
followed than ever I older and more obscure But no mattera secret
voice I am sure says to you at this moment that between us two
however different there exists an invisible bond a mysterious
communion which nothing hereafter will ever be able to destroy

He uttered these final words in a tone of such profound emotion that
Adrienne started Rodin had approached without her perceiving it and
without as it were walking at all for he dragged his steps along the
floor with a sort of serpent motion and he had spoken with so much
warmth and enthusiasm that his pale face had become slightly tinged
and his repulsive ugliness had almost disappeared before the brilliancy
of his small sharp eyes now wide open and fixed full upon Adrienne
The latter leaned forward with halfopen lips and deepdrawn breath
nor could she take her eyes from the Jesuits he had ceased to speak
and yet she was still listening The feelings of the fair young lady
in presence of this little old man dirty ugly and poor were
inexplicable That comparison so common and yet so true of the
frightful fascination of the bird by the serpent might give some idea
of the singular impression made upon her Rodins tactics were skillful
and sure Until now Mdlle de Cardoville had never analyzed her tastes
or instincts She had followed them because they were inoffensive and
charming How happy and proud she then was sure to be to hear a man of
superior mind not only praise these tendencies for which she had been
heretofore so severely blamed but congratulate her upon them as upon
something great noble and divine If Rodin had only addressed himself
to Adriennes selfconceit he would have failed in his perfidious
designs for she had not the least spark of vanity But he addressed
himself to all that was enthusiastic and generous in her heart that
which he appeared to encourage and admire in her was really worthy of
encouragement and admiration How could she fail to be the dupe of such
language concealing though it did such dark and fatal projects

Struck with the Jesuits rare intelligence feeling her curiosity
greatly excited by some mysterious words that he had purposely uttered
hardly explaining to herself the strange influence which this pernicious
counsellor already exercised over her and animated by respectful
compassion for a man of his age and talents placed in so precarious a
position Adrienne said to him with all her natural cordiality A man
of your merit and character sir ought not to be at the mercy of the
caprice of circumstances Some of your words have opened a new horizon
before me I feel that on many points your counsels may be of the
greatest use to me Moreover in coming to fetch me from this house and
in devoting yourself to the service of other persons of my family
you have shown me marks of interest which I cannot forget without
ingratitude You have lost a humble but secure situation Permit me

Not a word more my dear young lady said Rodin interrupting Mdlle
de Cardoville with an air of chagrin I feel for you the deepest
sympathy I am honored by having ideas in common with you I believe
firmly that some day you will have to ask advice of the poor old
philosopher and precisely because of all that I must and ought to
maintain towards you the most complete independence

But sir it is I that would be the obliged party if you deigned to
accept what I offer

Oh my dear young lady said Rodin with a smile I know that your
generosity would always know how to make gratitude light and easy but
once more I cannot accept anything from you One day perhaps you will
know why

One day

It is impossible for me to tell you more And then supposing I were
under an obligation to you how could I tell you all that was good and
beautiful in your actions Hereafter if you are somewhat indebted to
me for my advice so much the better I shall be the more ready to blame
you if I find anything to blame

In this way sir you would forbid me to be grateful to you

No no said Rodin with apparent emotion Oh believe me there will
come a solemn moment in which you may repay all in a manner worthy of
yourself and me

This conversation was here interrupted by the nurse who said to
Adrienne as she entered Madame there is a little humpback workwoman
downstairs who wishes to speak to you As according to the doctors
new orders you are to do as you like I have come to ask if I am to
bring her up to you She is so badly dressed that I did not venture

Bring her up by all means said Adrienne hastily for she had
recognized Mother Bunch by the nurses description Bring her up
directly

The doctor has also left word that his carriage is to be at your
orders madame are the horses to be put to

Yes in a quarter of an hour answered Adrienne to the nurse who
went out then addressing Rodin she continued I do not think the
magistrate can now be long before he returns with Marshal Simons
daughters

I think not my dear young lady but who is this deformed workwoman
asked Rodin with an air of indifference

The adopted sister of a gallant fellow who risked all in endeavoring
to rescue me from this house And sir said Adrienne with emotion
this young workwoman is a rare and excellent creature Never was
a nobler mind a more generous heart concealed beneath an exterior
less

But reflecting that Rodin seemed to unite in his own person the same
moral and physical contrasts as the sewinggirl Adrienne stopped short
and then added with inimitable grace as she looked at the Jesuit who
was somewhat astonished at the sudden pause No this noble girl is
not the only person who proves how loftiness of soul and superiority of
mind can make us indifferent to the vain advantages which belong
only to the accidents of birth or fortune At the moment of Adrienne
speaking these last words Mother Bunch entered the room




CHAPTER XXXVI SUSPICIONS

Mdlle de Cardoville sprang hastily to meet the visitor and said
to her in a voice of emotion as she extended her arms towards her
Comecomethere is no grating to separate us now

On this allusion which reminded her how her poor laborious hand had
been respectfully kissed by the fair and rich patrician the young
workwoman felt a sentiment of gratitude which was at once ineffable
and proud But as she hesitated to respond to the cordial reception
Adrienne embraced her with touching affection When Mother Bunch found
herself clasped in the fair arms of Mdlle de Cardoville when she felt
the fresh and rosy lips of the young lady fraternally pressed to her own
pale and sickly cheek she burst into tears without being able to utter
a word Rodin retired in a corner of the chamber locked on this scene
with secret uneasiness Informed of the refusal so full of dignity
which Mother Bunch had opposed to the perfidious temptations of the
superior of St Marys Convent and knowing the deep devotion of this
generous creature for Agricolaa devotion which for some days she had
so bravely extended to Mdlle de Cardovillethe Jesuit did not like
to see the latter thus laboring to increase that affection He thought
wisely that one should never despise friend or enemy however small
they may appear Now devotion to Mdlle de Cardoville constituted an
enemy in his eyes and we know moreover that Rodin combined in
his character rare firmness with a certain degree of superstitious
weakness and he now felt uneasy at the singular impression of fear
which Mother Bunch inspired in him He determined to recollect this
presentiment

Delicate natures sometimes display in the smallest things the most
charming instincts of grace and goodness Thus when the sewinggirl was
shedding abundant and sweet tears of gratitude Adrienne took a richly
embroidered handkerchief and dried the pale and melancholy face This
action so simple and spontaneous spared the workgirl one humiliation
for alas humiliation and suffering are the two gulfs along the edge
of which misfortune continually passes Therefore the least kindness is
in general a double benefit to the unfortunate Perhaps the reader may
smile in disdain at the puerile circumstance we mention But poor
Mother Bunch not venturing to take from her pocket her old ragged
handkerchief would long have remained blinded by her tears if Mdlle
de Cardoville had not come to her aid

Oh you are so goodso nobly charitable lady was all that the
sempstress could say in a tone of deep emotion for she was still more
touched by the attention of the young lady than she would perhaps have
been by a service rendered

Look there sir said Adrienne to Rodin who drew near hastily
Yes added the young patrician proudly I have indeed discovered
a treasure Look at her sir and love her as I love her honor as I
honor She has one of those hearts for which we are seeking

And which thank heaven we are still able to find my dear young
lady said Rodin as he bowed to the needlewoman

The latter raised her eyes slowly and locked at the Jesuit At sight of
that cadaverous countenance which was smiling benignantly upon her the
young girl started It was strange she had never seen this man and
yet she felt instantly the same fear and repulsion that he had felt with
regard to her Generally timid and confused the workgirl could not
withdraw her eyes from Rodins her heart beat violently as at the
coming of some great danger and as the excellent creature feared only
for those she loved she approached Adrienne involuntarily keeping
her eyes fixed on Rodin The Jesuit was too good a physiognomist not to
perceive the formidable impression he had made and he felt an increase
of his instinctive aversion for the sempstress Instead of casting down
his eyes he appeared to examine her with such sustained attention that
Mdlle de Cardoville was astonished at it

I beg your pardon my dear girl said Rodin as if recalling his
recollections and addressing himself to Mother Bunch I beg your
pardonbut I thinkif I am not deceiveddid you not go a few days
since to St Marys Convent hard by

Yes sir

No doubt it was you Where then was my head cried Rodin It was
youI should have guessed it sooner

Of what do you speak sir asked Adrienne

Oh you are right my dear young lady said Rodin pointing to the
hunchback She has indeed a noble heart such as we seek If you knew
with what dignity with what courage this poor girl who was out of work
and for her to want work is to want everythingif you knew I say
with what dignity she rejected the shameful wages that the superior of
the convent was unprincipled enough to offer on condition of her acting
as a spy in a family where it was proposed to place her

Oh that is infamous cried Mdlle de Cardoville with disgust Such
a proposal to this poor girlto her

Madame said Mother Bunch bitterly I had no work I was poor they
did not know meand they thought they might propose anything to the
likes of me

And I tell you said Rodin that it was a double baseness on the part
of the superior to offer such temptation to misery and it was doubly
noble in you to refuse

Sir said the sewinggirl with modest embarrassment

Oh I am not to be intimidated resumed Rod in Praise or blame I
speak out roughly what I think Ask this dear young lady he added
with a glance at Adrienne I tell you plainly that I think as well of
you as she does herself

Believe me dear said Adrienne there are some sorts of praise which
honor recompense and encourage and M Rodins is of the number I
know ityes I know it

Nay my dear young lady you must not ascribe to me all the honor of
this judgment

How so sir

Is not this dear girl the adopted sister of Agricola Baudoin the
gallant workman the energetic and popular poet Is not the affection of
such a man the best of guarantees and does it not enable us to judge
as it were by the label added Rodin with a smile

You are right sir said Adrienne for before knowing this dear
girl I began to feel deeply interested in her from the day that her
adopted brother spoke to me about her He expressed himself with so much
warmth so much enthusiasm that I at once conceived an esteem for the
person capable of inspiring so noble an attachment

These words of Adrienne joined to another circumstance had such
an effect upon their hearer that her pale face became crimson The
unfortunate hunchback loved Agricola with love as passionate as it was
secret and painful the most indirect allusion to this fatal sentiment
occasioned her the most cruel embarrassment Now the moment Mdlle de
Cardoville spoke of Agricolas attachment for Mother Bunch the latter
had encountered Rodins observing and penetrating look fixed upon her
Alone with Adrienne the sempstress would have felt only a momentary
confusion on hearing the name of the smith but unfortunately she
fancied that the Jesuit who already filled her with involuntary fear
had seen into her heart and read the secrets of that fatal love of
which she was the victim Thence the deep blushes of the poor girl and
the embarrassment so painfully visible that Adrienne was struck with
it

A subtle and prompt mind like Rodins on perceiving the smallest
effect immediately seeks the cause Proceeding by comparison the
Jesuit saw on one side a deformed but intelligent young girl capable
of passionate devotion on the other a young workman handsome bold
frank and full of talent Brought up together sympathizing with each
other on many points there must be some fraternal affection between
them said he to himself but fraternal affection does not blush and
the hunchback blushed and grew troubled beneath my look does she then
Love Agricola

Once on the scent of this discovery Rodin wished to pursue the
investigation Remarking the surprise and visible uneasiness that Mother
Bunch had caused in Adrienne he said to the latter with a smile
looking significantly at the needlewoman You see my dear young
lady how she blushes The good girl is troubled by what we said of the
attachment of this gallant workman

The needlewoman hung down her head overcome with confusion After the
pause of a second during which Rodin preserved silence so as to give
time for his cruel remark to pierce the heart of the victim the savage
resumed Look at the dear girl how embarrassed she appears

Again after another silence perceiving that Mother Bunch from crimson
had become deadly pale and was trembling in all her limbs the Jesuit
feared he had gone too far whilst Adrienne said to her friend with
anxiety Why dear child are you so agitated

Oh it is clear enough resumed Rodin with an air of perfect
simplicity for having discovered what he wished to know he now chose
to appear unconscious It is quite clear and plain This good girl has
the modesty of a kind and tender sister for a brother When you praise
him she fancies that she is herself praised

And she is as modest as she is excellent added Adrienne taking bath
of the girls hands the least praise either of her adopted brother or
of herself troubles her in this way But it is mere childishness and I
must scold her for it

Mdlle de Cardoville spoke sincerely for the explanation given by Rodin
appeared to her very plausible Like all other persons who dreading
every moment the discovery of some painful secret have their courage
as easily restored as shaken Mother Bunch persuaded herself and she
needed to do so to escape dying of shame that the last words of Rodin
were sincere and that he had no idea of the love she felt for Agricola
So her agony diminished and she found words to reply to Mdlle de
Cardoville

Excuse me madame she said timidly I am so little accustomed to
such kindness as that with which you overwhelm me that I make a sorry
return for all your goodness

Kindness my poor girl said Adrienne I have done nothing for
you yet But thank heaven from this day I shall be able to keep my
promise and reward your devotion to me your courageous resignation
your sacred love of labor and the dignity of which you have given so
many proofs under the most cruel privations In a word from this day
if you do not object to it we will part no more

Madame you are too kind said Mother Bunch in a trembling voice
but I

Oh be satisfied said Adrienne anticipating her meaning If you
accept my offer I shall know how to reconcile with my desire not
a little selfish of having you near me the independence of your
character your habits of labor your taste for retirement and your
anxiety to devote yourself to those who deserve commiseration it is
I confess by affording you the means of satisfying these generous
tendencies that I hope to seduce and keep you by me

But what have I done asked the other simply to merit any gratitude
from you Did you not begin on the contrary by acting so generously to
my adopted brother

Oh I do not speak of gratitude said Adrienne we are quits I speak
of friendship and sincere affection which I now offer you

Friendship to me madame

Come come said Adrienne with a charming smile do not be proud
because your position gives you the advantage I have set my heart on
having you for a friend and you will see that it shall be so But now
that I think of it a little late you will say what good wind brings
you hither

This morning M Dagobert received a letter in which he was requested
to come to this place to learn some news that would be of the greatest
interest to him Thinking it concerned Marshal Simons daughters he
said to me Mother Bunch you have taken so much interest in those
dear children that you must come with me you shall witness my joy on
finding them and that will be your reward

Adrienne glanced at Rodin The latter made an affirmative movement of
the head and answered Yes yes my dear young lady it was I who
wrote to the brave soldier but without signing the letter or giving
any explanation You shall know why

Then my dear girl why did you come alone said Adrienne

Alas madame on arriving here it was your kind reception that made me
forget my fears

What fears asked Rodin

Knowing that you lived here madame I supposed the letter was from
you I told M Dagobert so and he thought the same When we arrived
his impatience was so great that he asked at the door if the orphans
were in this house and he gave their description They told him no
Then in spite of my supplications he insisted on going to the convent
to inquire about them

What imprudence cried Adrienne

After what took place the other night when he broke in added Rodin
shrugging his shoulders

It was in vain to tell him returned Mother Bunch that the letter
did not announce positively that the orphans would be delivered up to
him but that no doubt he would gain some information about them He
refused to hear anything but said to me If I cannot find them I will
rejoin you But they were at the convent the day before yesterday and
now that all is discovered they cannot refuse to give them up

And with such a man there is no disputing said Rodin with a smile

I hope they will not recognize him said Adrienne remembering
Baleiniers threats

It is not likely replied Rodin they will only refuse him
admittance That will be I hope the worst misfortune that will happen
Besides the magistrate will soon be here with the girls I am no longer
wanted other cares require my attention I must seek out Prince Djalma
Only tell me my dear young lady where I shall find you to keep you
informed of my discoveries and to take measures with regard to the
young prince if my inquiries as I hope shall be attended with
success

You will find me in my new house Rue dAnjou formerly Beaulieu House
But now I think of it said Adrienne suddenly after some moments of
reflection it would not be prudent or proper on many accounts to
lodge the Prince Djalma in the pavilion I occupied at SaintDizier
House I saw some time ago a charming little house all furnished and
ready it only requires some embellishments that could be completed in
twenty four hours to make it a delightful residence Yes that will be
a thousand times preferable added Mdlle de Cardoville after a new
interval of silence and I shall thus be able to preserve the strictest
incognito

What cried Rodin whose projects would be much impeded by this new
resolution of the young lady you do not wish him to know who you are

I wish Prince Djalma to know absolutely nothing of the anonymous friend
who comes to his aid I desire that my name should not be pronounced
before him and that he should not even know of my existenceat
least for the present Hereafterin a month perhapsI will see
circumstances will guide me

But this incognito said Rodin hiding his disappointment will be
difficult to preserve

If the prince had inhabited the lodge I agree with you the
neighborhood of my aunt would have enlightened him and this fear is one
of the reasons that have induced me to renounce my first project But
the prince will inhabit a distant quarterthe Rue Blanche Who will
inform him of my secret One of my old friends M Norvalyou sirand
this dear girl pointing to Mother Bunch on whose discretion I can
depend as on your own will be my only confidants My secret will then
be quite safe Besides we will talk further on this subject tomorrow
You must begin by discovering the retreat of this unfortunate young
prince

Rodin though much vexed at Adriennes subtle determination with
regard to Djalma put the best face on the matter and replied Your
intentions shall be scrupulously fulfilled my dear young lady and
tomorrow with your leave I hope to give you a good account of what
you are pleased to call my providential mission

Tomorrow then I shall expect you with impatience said Adrienne to
Rodin affectionately Permit me always to rely upon you as from this
day you may count upon me You must be indulgent with me sir for I see
that I shall yet have many counsels many services to ask of youthough
I already owe you so much

You will never owe me enough my dear young lady never enough
said Rodin as he moved discreetly towards the door after bowing to
Adrienne At the very moment he was going out he found himself face to
face with Dagobert

Holloa at last I have caught one shouted the soldier as he seized
the Jesuit by the collar with a vigorous hand




CHAPTER XXXVII EXCUSES

On seeing Dagobert grasp Rodin so roughly by the collar Mdlle de
Cardoville exclaimed in terror as she advanced several steps towards
the soldier In the name of Heaven sir what are you doing

What am I doing echoed the soldier harshly without relaxing his
hold on Rodin and turning his head towards Adrienne whom he did not
know I take this opportunity to squeeze the throat of one of the
wretches in the band of that renegade until he tells me where my poor
children are

You strangle me said the Jesuit in a stifled voice as he tried to
escape from the soldier

Where are the orphans since they are not here and the convent door
has been closed against me cried Dagobert in a voice of thunder

Help help gasped Rodin

Oh it is dreadful said Adrienne as pale and trembling she held up
her clasped hands to Dagobert Have mercy sir listen to me listen to
him

M Dagobert cried Mother Bunch seizing with her weak hands the
soldiers arm and showing him Adrienne this is Mdlle de Cardoville
What violence in her presence and then you are deceived doubtless

At the name of Mdlle de Cardoville the benefactress of his son the
soldier turned round suddenly and loosened his hold on Rodin The
latter crimson with rage and suffocation set about adjusting his
collar and his cravat

I beg your pardon madame said Dagobert going towards Adrienne who
was still pale with fright I did not known who you were and the first
impulse of anger quite carried me away

But what has this gentleman done to you said Adrienne If you had
listened to me you would have learned

Excuse me if I interrupt you madame said the soldier to Adrienne in
a hollow voice Then addressing himself to Rodin who had recovered his
coolness he added Thank the lady and begoneIf you remain here I
will not answer for myself

One word only my dear sir said Rodin

I tell you that if you remain I will not answer for myself cried
Dagobert stamping his foot

But for heavens sake tell me the cause of this anger resumed
Adrienne above all do not trust to appearances Calm yourself and
listen

Calm myself madame cried Dagobert in despair I can think only of
one thing ma dameof the arrival of Marshal Simonhe will be in Paris
today or tomorrow

Is it possible said Adrienne Rodin started with surprise and joy

Yesterday evening proceeded Dagobert I received a letter from the
marshal he has landed at Havre For three days I have taken step
after step hoping that the orphans would be restored to me as the
machinations of those wretches have failed He pointed to Rodin with a
new gesture of impatience Well it is not so They are conspiring some
new infamy I am prepared for anything

But sir said Rodin advancing permit me

Begone cried Dagobert whose irritation and anxiety redoubled as he
thought how at any moment Marshal Simon might arrive in Paris Begone
Were it not for this lady I would at least be revenged on some one

Rodin made a nod of intelligence to Adrienne whom he approached
prudently and pointing to Dagobert with a gesture of affectionate
commiseration he said to the latter I will leave you sir and the
more willingly as I was about to withdraw when you entered Then
coming still closer to Mdlle de Cardoville the Jesuit whispered
to her Poor soldier he is beside himself with grief and would be
incapable of hearing me Explain it all to him my dear young lady
he will be nicely caught added he with a cunning air But in the
meantime resumed Rodin feeling in the sidepocket of his greatcoat
and taking out a small parcel let me beg you to give him this my dear
young lady It is my revenge and a very good one

And while Adrienne holding the little parcel in her hand looked at the
Jesuit with astonishment the latter laying his forefinger upon his lip
as if recommending silence drew backward on tiptoe to the door and
went out after again pointing to Dagobert with a gesture of pity while
the soldier in sullen dejection with his head drooping and his arms
crossed upon his bosom remained deaf to the sewinggirls earnest
consolations When Rodin had left the room Adrienne approaching the
soldier said to him in her mild voice with an expression of deep
interest Your sudden entry prevented my asking you a question that
greatly concerns me How is your wound

Thank you madame said Dagobert starting from his painful lethargy
it is of no consequence but I have not time to think of it I am sorry
to have been so rough in your presence and to have driven away that
wretch but tis more than I could master At sight of those people my
blood is all up

And yet believe me you have been too hasty in your judgment The
person who was just now here

Too hasty madame I do not see him today for the first time He was
with that renegade the Abbe dAigrigny

No doubtand yet he is an honest and excellent man

He cried Dagobert

Yes for at this moment he is busy about only one thing restoring to
you those dear children

He repeated Dagobert as if he could not believe what he heard He
restore me my children

Yes and sooner perhaps than you think for

Madame said Dagobert abruptly he deceives you You are the dupe of
that old rascal

No said Adrienne shaking her head with a smile I have proofs of
his good faith First of all it is he who delivers me from this house

Is it true said Dagobert quite confounded

Very true and here is perhaps something that will reconcile you to
him said Adrienne as she delivered the small parcel which Rodin
had given her as he went out Not wishing to exasperate you by his
presence he said to me Give this to that brave soldier it is my
revenge

Dagobert looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with surprise as he
mechanically opened the little parcel When he had unfolded it and
discovered his own silver cross black with age and the old red faded
ribbon treasures taken from him at the White Falcon Inn at the same
time as his papers he exclaimed in a broken voice My cross my cross
It is my cross In the excitement of his joy he pressed the silver
star to his gray moustache

Adrienne and the other were deeply affected by the emotion of the old
soldier who continued as he ran towards the door by which Rodin had
gone out Next to a service rendered to Marshal Simon my wife or son
nothing could be more precious to me And you answer for this worthy
man madame and I have ill used him in your presence Oh he is
entitled to reparation and he shall have it

So saying Dagobert left the room precipitately hastened through two
other apartments gained the staircase and descending it rapidly
overtook Rodin on the lowest step

Sir said the soldier to him in an agitated voice as he seized him
by the arm you must come upstairs directly

You should make up your mind to one thing or the other my dear sir
said Rodin stopping goodnaturedly one moment you tell me to begone
and the next to return How are we to decide

Just now sir I was wrong and when I am wrong I acknowledge it
I abused and illtreated you before witnesses I will make you my
apologies before witnesses

But my dear sirI am much obliged to youI am in a hurry

I cannot help your being in a hurry I tell you I must have you come
upstairs directlyor elseor else resumed Dagobert taking the hand
of the Jesuit and pressing it with as much cordiality as emotion or
else the happiness you have caused the in returning my cross will not be
complete

Well then my good friend let us go up

And not only have you restored me my cross for which I have wept many
tears believe me unknown to any one cried Dagobert much affected
but the young lady told me that thanks to you those poor children
but tell meno false joyis it really trueMy God is it really
true

Ah ah Mr Inquisitive said Rodin with a cunning smile Then he
added Be perfectly tranquil my growler you shall have your two
angels back again And the Jesuit began to ascend the stairs

Will they be restored to me today cried Dagobert stopping Rodin
abruptly by catching hold of his sleeve

Now really my good friend said the Jesuit let us come to the
point Are we to go up or down I do not find fault but you turn me
about like a teetotum

You are right We shall be better able to explain things upstairs Come
with mequick quick said Dagobert as taking the Jesuit by the arm
he hurried him along and brought him triumphantly into the room where
Adrienne and Mother Bunch had remained in much surprise at the soldiers
sudden disappearance

Here he is here he is cried Dagobert as he entered Luckily I
caught him at the bottom of the stairs

And you have made me come up at a fine pace added Rodin pretty well
out of breath

Now sir said Dagobert in a grave voice I declare in presence of
all that I was wrong to abuse and illtreat you I make you my apology
for it sir and I acknowledge with joy that I owe youmuchoh very
much and when I owe I pay

So saying Dagobert held out his honest hand to Rodin who pressed it
in a very affable manner and replied Now reallywhat is all this
about What great service do you speak of

This said Dagobert holding up the cross before Rodins eyes You do
not know then what this cross is to me

On the contrary supposing you would set great store by it I intended
to have the pleasure of delivering it myself I had brought it for that
purpose but between ourselves you gave me so warm a reception that I
had not the time

Sir said Dagobert in confusion I assure you that I sincerely
repent of what I have done

I know it my good friend do not say another word about it You were
then much attached to this cross

Attached to it sir cried Dagobert Why this cross and he kissed
it as he spoke is my relic He from whom it came was my saintmy
heroand he had touched it with his hand

Oh said Rodin feigning to regard the cross with as much curiosity as
respectful admiration did Napoleonthe Great Napoleonindeed touch
with his own handthat victorious handthis noble star of honor

Yes sir with his own hand He placed it there upon my bleeding
breast as a cure for my fifth wound So that you see were I dying of
hunger I think I should not hesitate betwixt bread and my crossthat
I might in any case have it on my heart in death But enoughenough
let us talk of something else It is foolish in an old soldier is it
not added Dagobert drawing his hand across his eyes and then as
if ashamed to deny what he really felt Well then yes he resumed
raising his head proudly and no longer seeking to conceal the tears
that rolled down his cheek yes I weep for joy to have found my
crossmy cross that the Emperor gave me with his victorious hand as
this worthy man has called it

Then blessed be my poor old hand for having restored you the glorious
treasure said Rodin with emotion In truth he added the day will
be a good one for everybodyas I announced to you this morning in my
letter

That letter without a signature asked the soldier more and more
astonished Was it from you

It was I who wrote it Only fearing some new snare of the Abbe
dAigrigny I did not choose you understand to explain myself more
clearly

ThenI shall seemy orphans

Rodin nodded affirmatively with an expression of great goodnature

Presentlyperhaps immediately said Adrienne with smile Well was
I right in telling you that you had not judged this gentleman fairly

Why did he not tell me this when I came in cried Dagobert almost
beside himself with joy

There was one difficulty in the way my good friend said Rodin it
was that when you came in you nearly throttled me

True I was too hasty Once more I ask your pardon But was I to
blame I had only seen you with that Abbe dAigrigny and in the first
moment

This dear young lady said Rodin bowing to Adrienne will tell you
that I have been without knowing it the accomplice IN many perfidious
actions but as soon as I began to see my way through the darkness I
quitted the evil course on which I had entered and returned to that
which is honest just and true

Adrienne nodded affirmatively to Dagobert who appeared to consult her
look

If I did not sign the letter that I wrote to you my good friend it
was partly from fear that my name might inspire suspicion and if I
asked you to come hither instead of to the convent it was that I had
some dreadlike this dear young ladylest you might be recognized by
the porter or by the gardener your affair of the other night rendering
such a recognition somewhat dangerous

But M Baleinier knows all I forgot that said Adrienne with
uneasiness He threatened to denounce M Dagobert and his son if I
made any complaint

Do not be alarmed my dear young lady it will soon be for you to
dictate conditions replied Rodin Leave that to me and as for you
my good friend your torments are now finished

Yes said Adrienne an upright and worthy magistrate has gone to the
convent to fetch Marshal Simons daughters He will bring them hither
but he thought with me that it would be most proper for them to take
up their abode in my house I cannot however come to this decision
without your consent for it is to you that these orphans were entrusted
by their mother

You wish to take her place with regard to them madame replied
Dagobert I can only thank you with all my heart for myself and for
the children But as the lesson has been a sharp one I must beg to
remain at the door of their chamber night and day If they go out with
you I must be allowed to follow them at a little distance so as to
keep them in view just like Spoilsport who has proved himself a
better guardian than myself When the marshal is once hereit will be
in a day or twomy post will be relieved Heaven grant it may be soon

Yes replied Rodin in a firm voice heaven grant he may arrive soon
for he will have to demand a terrible reckoning of the Abbe dAigrigny
for the persecution of his daughters and yet the marshal does not know
all

And dont you tremble for the renegade asked Dagobert as he thought
how the marquis would soon find himself face to face with the marshal

I never care for cowards and traitors answered Rodin and when
Marshal Simon returns Then after a pause of some seconds he
continued If he will do me the honor to hear me he shall be edified
as to the conduct of the Abbe dAigrigny The marshal knows that his
dearest friends as well as himself have been victims of the hatred of
that dangerous man

How so said Dagobert

Why yourself for instance replied Rodin you are an example of
what I advance

Do you think it was mere chance that brought about the scene at the
White Falcon Inn near Leipsic

Who told you of that scene said Dagobert in astonishment

Where you accepted the challenge of Morok continued the Jesuit
without answering Dagoberts question and so fell into a trap or else
refused it and were then arrested for want of papers and thrown into
prison as a vagabond with these poor children Now do you know the
object of this violence It was to prevent your being here on the 13th
of February

But the more I hear sir said Adrienne the more I am alarmed at the
audacity of the Abbe dAigrigny and the extent of the means he has at
his command Really she resumed with increasing surprise if your
words were not entitled to absolute belief

You would doubt their truth madame said Dagobert It is like me
Bad as he is I cannot think that this renegade had relations with a
wildbeast showman as far off as Saxony and then how could he know
that I and the children were to pass through Leipsic It is impossible
my good man

In fact sir resumed Adrienne I fear that you are deceived by your
dislike a very legitimate one of Abbe dAigrigny and that you ascribe
to him an almost fabulous degree of power and extent of influence

After a moments silence during which Rodin looked first at Adrienne
and then at Dagobert with a kind of pity he resumed How could
the Abbe dAigrigny have your cross in his possession if he had no
connection with Morok

That is true sir said Dagobert joy prevented me from reflecting
But how indeed did my cross come into your hands

By means of the Abbe dAigrignys having precisely those relations with
Leipsic of which you and the young lady seem to doubt

But how did my cross get to Paris

Tell me you were arrested at Leipsic for want of papersis it not
so

Yes but I could never understand how my passports and money
disappeared from my knapsack I thought I must have had the misfortune
to lose them

Rodin shrugged his shoulders and replied You were robbed of them
at the White Falcon Inn by Goliath one of Moroks servants and the
latter sent the papers and the cross to the Abbe dAigrigny to prove
that he had succeeded in executing his orders with respect to the
orphans and yourself It was the day before yesterday that I obtained
the key of that dark machination Cross and papers were amongst the
stores of Abbe dAigrigny the papers formed a considerable bundle
and he might have missed them but hoping to see you this morning and
knowing how a soldier of the Empire values his cross his sacred relic
as you call it my good friendI did not hesitate I put the relic into
my pocket After all said I it is only restitution and my delicacy
perhaps exaggerates this breach of trust

You could not have done a better action said Adrienne and for my
part because of the interest I feel for M DagobertI take it as a
personal favor But sir after a moments silence she resumed with
anxiety What terrible power must be at the command of M dAigrigny
for him to have such extensive and formidable relations in a foreign
country

Silence said Rodin in a low voice and looking round him with an air
of alarm Silence In heavens name do not ask me about it




CHAPTER XXXVIII REVELATIONS

Mdlle de Cardoville much astonished at the alarm displayed by Rodin
when she had asked him for some explanation of the formidable and far
reaching power of the Abby dAigrigny said to him Why sir what is
there so strange in the question that I have just asked you

After a moments silence Rodin cast his looks all around with well
feigned uneasiness and replied in a whisper Once more madame do not
question me on so fearful a subject The walls of this house may have
ears

Adrienne and Dagobert looked at each other with growing surprise Mother
Bunch by an instinct of incredible force continued to regard Rodin
with invincible suspicion Sometimes she stole a glance at him as if
trying to penetrate the mask of this man who filled her with fear At
one moment the Jesuit encountered her anxious gaze obstinately fixed
upon him immediately he nodded to her with the greatest amenity The
young girl alarmed at finding herself observed turned away with a
shudder

No no my dear young lady resumed Rodin with a sigh as he saw
Mdlle de Cardoville astonished at his silence do not question me on
the subject of the Abbe dAigrignys power

But to persist sir said Adrienne why this hesitation to answer
What do you fear

Ah my dear young lady said Rodin shuddering those people are so
powerful their animosity is so terrible

Be satisfied sir I owe you too much for my support ever to fail
you

Ah my dear young lady cried Rodin as if hurt by the supposition
think better of me I entreat you Is it for myself that I fearNo
no I am too obscure too inoffensive but it is for you for Marshal
Simon for the other members of your family that all is to be feared
Oh my dear young lady let me beg you to ask no questions There are
secrets which are fatal to those who possess them

But sir is it not better to know the perils with which one is
threatened

When you know the manoeuvres of your enemy you may at least defend
yourself said Dagobert I prefer an attack in broad daylight to an
ambuscade

And I assure you resumed Adrienne the few words you have spoken
cause me a vague uneasiness

Well if I must my dear young lady replied the Jesuit appearing to
make a great effort since you do not understand my hints I will be
more explicit but remember added he in a deeply serious tone that
you have persevered in forcing me to tell you what you had perhaps
better not have known

Speak Sir I pray you speak said Adrienne

Drawing about him Adrienne Dagobert and Mother Bunch Rodin said to
them in a low voce and with a mysterious air Have you never heard of
a powerful association which extends its net over all the earth and
counts its disciples agents and fanatics in every class of society
which has had and often has still the ear of kings and nobleswhich
in a word can raise its creatures to the highest positions and with a
word can reduce them again to the nothingness from which it alone could
uplift them

Good heaven sir said Adrienne what formidable association Until
now I never heard of it

I believe you and yet your ignorance on this subject greatly
astonishes me my dear young lady

And why should it astonish you

Because you lived some time with your aunt and must have often seen
the Abbe dAigrigny

I lived at the princesss but not with her for a thousand reasons she
had inspired me with warrantable aversion

In truth my dear young lady my remark was illjudged It was there
above all and particularly in your presence that they would keep
silence with regard to this associationand yet to it alone did the
Princess de SaintDizier owe her formidable influence in the world
during the last reign Well then know thisit is the aid of that
association which renders the Abbe dAigrigny so dangerous a man

By it he was enabled to follow and to reach divers members of your
family some in Siberia some in India others on the heights of the
American mountains but as I have told you it was only the day before
yesterday and by chance that examining the papers of Abbe dAigrigny
I found the trace of his connection with this Company of which he is
the most active and able chief

But the name sir the name of this Company said Adrienne

Well it is but Rodin stopped short

It is repeated Adrienne who was now as much interested as Dagobert
and the sempstress it is

Rodin looked round him beckoned all the actors in this scene to draw
nearer and said in a whisper laying great stress upon the words It
isthe Society of Jesus and he again shuddered

The Jesuits cried Mdlle de Cardoville unable to restrain a burst
of laughter which was the more buoyant as from the mysterious
precautions of Rodin she had expected some very different revelation
The Jesuits she resumed still laughing They have no existence
except in books they are frightful historical personages certainly
but why should you put forward Madame de SaintDizier and M dAigrigny
in that character Such as they are they have done quite enough to
justify my aversion and disdain

After listening in silence to Mdlle de Cardoville Rodin continued with
a grave and agitated air Your blindness frightens me my dear young
lady the past should have given you some anxiety for the future since
more than any one you have already suffered from the fatal influence of
this Company whose existence you regard as a dream

I sir said Adrienne with a smile although a little surprised

You

Under what circumstances

You ask me this question my dear young lady you ask me this
questionand yet you have been confined here as a mad person Is it
not enough to tell you that the master of this house is one of the most
devoted lay members of the Company and therefore the blind instrument
of the Abbe dAigrigny

So said Adrienne this time without smiling Dr Baleinier

Obeyed the Abbe dAigrigny the most formidable chief of that
formidable society He employs his genius for evil but I must confess
he is a man of genius Therefore it is upon him that you and yours must
fix all your doubts and suspicions it is against him that you must be
upon your guard For believe me I know him and he does not look upon
the game as lost You must be prepared for new attacks doubtless of
another kind but only the more dangerous on that account

Luckily you give us notice said Dagobert and you will be on our
side

I can do very little my good friends but that little is at the
service of honest people said Rodin

Now said Adrienne with a thoughtful air completely persuaded by
Rodins air of conviction I can explain the inconceivable influence
that my aunt exercised in the world I ascribed it chiefly to her
relations with persons in power I thought that she like the Abbe
dAigrigny was concerned in dark intrigues for which religion served
as a veilbut I was far from believing what you tell me

How many things you have got to learn resumed Rodin If you knew my
dear young lady with what art these people surround you without your
being aware of it by agents devoted to themselves Every one of your
steps is known to them when they have any interest in such knowledge
Thus little by little they act upon youslowly cautiously
darkly They circumvent you by every possible means from flattery to
terrorseduce or frighten in order at last to rule you without your
being conscious of their authority Such is their object and I must
confess they pursue it with detestable ability

Rodin had spoken with so much sincerity that Adrienne trembled then
reproaching herself with these fears she resumed And yet noI can
never believe in so infernal a power the might of priestly ambition
belongs to another age Heaven be praised it has disappeared forever

Yes certainly it is out of sight for they now know how to disperse
and disappear when circumstances require it But then are they the
most dangerous for suspicion is laid asleep and they keep watch in the
dark Oh my dear young lady if you knew their frightful ability In
my hatred of all that is oppressive cowardly and hypocritical I had
studied the history of that terrible society before I knew that the
Abbe dAigrigny belonged to it Oh it is dreadful If you knew what
means they employ When I tell you that thanks to their diabolical
devices the most pure and devoted appearances often conceal the most
horrible snares Rodins eye rested as if by chance on the hunchback
but seeing that Adrienne did not take the hint the Jesuit continued
In a wordare you not exposed to their pursuitshave they any
interest in gaining you overoh from that moment suspect all that
surround you suspect the most noble attachments the most tender
affections for these monsters sometimes succeed in corrupting your
best friends and making a terrible use of them in proportion to the
blindness of your confidence

Oh it is impossible cried Adrienne in horror You must exaggerate
No hell itself never dreamed of more frightful treachery

Alas my dear young lady one of your relations M Hardythe most
loyal and generoushearted man that could behas been the victim of
some such infamous treachery Do you know what we learned from the
reading of your ancestors will Why that he died the victim of the
malevolence of these people and now at the lapse of a hundred and
fifty years his descendants are still exposed to the hate of that
indestructible society

Oh sir it terrifies me said Adrienne feeling her heart sink within
her But are there no weapons against such attacks

Prudence my dear young ladythe most watchful cautionthe most
incessant study and suspicion of all that approach you

But such a life would be frightful It is a torture to be the victim of
continual suspicions doubts and fears

Without doubt They know it well the wretches That constitutes their
strength They often triumph by the very excess of the precautions
taken against them Thus my dear young lady and you brave and worthy
soldier in the name of all that is dear to you be on your guard and
do not lightly impart your confidence Be on your guard for you have
nearly fallen the victims of those people They will always be your
implacable enemies And you also poor interesting girl added the
Jesuit speaking to Mother Bunch follow my advicefear these people
Sleep as the proverb says with one eye open

I sir said the workgirl What have I done what have I to fear

What have you done Dear me Do not you tenderly love this young lady
your protectress have you not attempted to assist her Are you not the
adopted sister of the son of this intrepid soldier the brave Agricola
Alas poor girl are not these sufficient claims to their hatred in
spite of your obscurity Nay my dear young lady do not think that I
exaggerate Reflect only reflect Think what I have just said to
the faithful companioninarms of Marshal Simon with regard to his
imprisonment at Leipsic Think what happened to yourself when against
all law and reason you were brought hither Then you will see that
there is nothing exaggerated in the picture I have drawn of the secret
power of this Company Be always on your guard and in doubtful cases
do not fear to apply to me In three days I have learned enough by my
own experience with regard to their manner of acting to be able to
point out to you many a snare device and danger and to protect you
from them

In any such case sir replied Mdlle de Cardoville my interests as
well as gratitude would point to you as my best counsellor

According to the skillful tactics of the sons of Loyola who sometimes
deny their own existence in order to escape from an adversaryand
sometimes proclaim with audacity the living power of their organization
in order to intimidate the feebleRodin had laughed in the face of the
bailiff of Cardoville when the latter had spoken of the existence of
the Jesuits while now at this moment picturing their means of action
he endeavored and he succeeded in the endeavor to impregnate the mind
of Mdlle de Cardoville with some germs of doubt which were gradually
to develop themselves by reflection and serve hereafter the dark
projects that he meditated Mother Bunch still felt considerable alarm
with regard to Rodin Yet since she had heard the fatal powers of the
formidable Order revealed to Adrienne the young sempstress far from
suspecting the Jesuit of having the audacity to speak thus of a society
of which he was himself a member felt grateful to him in spite of
herself for the important advice that he had just given her patroness
The sideglance which she now cast upon him which Rodin also detected
for he watched the young girl with sustained attention was full
of gratitude mingled with surprise Guessing the nature of this
impression and wishing entirely to remove her unfavorable opinion and
also to anticipate a revelation which would be made sooner or later
the Jesuit appeared to have forgotten something of great importance
and exclaimed striking his forehead What was I thinking of Then
speaking to Mother Bunch he added Do you know where your sister is
my dear girl Disconcerted and saddened by this unexpected question
the workwoman answered with a blush for she remembered her last
interview with the brilliant Bacchanal Queen I have not seen my sister
for some days sir

Well my dear girl she is not very comfortable said Rodin I
promised one of her friends to send her some little assistance I have
applied to a charitable person and that is what I received for her
So saying he drew from his pocket a sealed roll of coin which he
delivered to Mother Bunch who was now both surprised and affected

You have a sister in trouble and I know nothing of it said Adrienne
hastily This is not right of you my child

Do not blame her said Rodin First of all she did not know that her
sister was in distress and secondly she could not ask you my dear
young lady to interest yourself about her

As Mdlle de Cardoville looked at Rodin with astonishment he added
again speaking to the hunchback Is not that true my dear girl

Yes sir said the sempstress casting down her eyes and blushing
Then she added hastily and anxiously But when did you see my sister
sir where is she how did she fall into distress

All that would take too long to tell you my dear girl but go as soon
as possible to the greengrocers in the Rue Clovis and ask to speak to
your sister as from M Charlemagne or M Rodin which you please for
I am equally well known in that house by my Christian name as by my
surname and then you will learn all about it Only tell your sister
that if she behaves well and keeps to her good resolutions there are
some who will continue to look after her

More and more surprised Mother Bunch was about to answer Rodin when
the door opened and M de Gernande entered The countenance of the
magistrate was grave and sad

Marshal Simons daughters cried Mdlle de Cardoville

Unfortunately they are not with me answered the judge

Then where are they sir What have they done with them The day
before yesterday they were in the convent cried Dagobert overwhelmed
by this complete destruction of his hopes

Hardly had the soldier pronounced these words when profiting by
the impulse which gathered all the actors in this scene about the
magistrate Rodin withdrew discreetly towards the door and disappeared
without any one perceiving his absence Whilst the soldier thus
suddenly thrown back to the depths of his despair looked at M de
Gernande waiting with anxiety for the answer Adrienne said to the
magistrate But sir when you applied at the convent what explanation
did the superior give on the subject of these young girls

The lady superior refused to give any explanation madame You
pretend said she that the young persons of whom you speak are
detained here against their will Since the law gives you the right of
entering this house make your search But madame please to answer
me positively said I to the superior do you declare that you know
nothing of the young girls whom I have come to claim I have nothing
to say on this subject sir You assert that you are authorized to
make a search make it Not being able to get any other explanation
continued the magistrate I searched all parts of the convent and had
every door openedbut unfortunately I could find no trace of these
young ladies

They must have sent them elsewhere cried Dagobert who
knowsperhaps ill They will kill themO God they will kill them
cried he in a heartrending tone

After such a refusal what is to be done Pray sir give us your
advice you are our providence said Adrienne turning to speak to
Rodin who she fancied was behind her What is your

Then perceiving that the Jesuit had suddenly disappeared she said to
Mother Bunch with uneasiness Where is M Rodin

I do not know madame answered the girl looking round her he is no
longer here

It is strange said Adrienne to disappear so abruptly

I told you he was a traitor cried Dagobert stamping with rage they
are all in a plot together

No no said Mdlle de Cardoville do not think that But the
absence is not the less to be regretted for under these difficult
circumstances he might have given us very useful information thanks to
the position he occupied at M dAigrignys

I confess madame that I rather reckoned upon it said M de
Gernande and I returned hither not only to inform you of the
fruitless result of my search but also to seek from the upright and
honorable roan who so courageously unveiled these odious machinations
the aid of his counsels in this contingency

Strangely enough for the last few moments Dagobert was so completely
absorbed in thought that he paid no attention to the words of the
magistrate however important to him He did not even perceive the
departure of M de Gernande who retired after promising Adrienne that
he would neglect no means to arrive at the truth in regard to the
disappearance of the orphans Uneasy at this silence wishing to quit
the house immediately and induce Dagobert to accompany her Adrienne
after exchanging a rapid glance with Mother Bunch was advancing towards
the soldier when hasty steps were heard from without the chamber and a
manly sonorous voice exclaiming with impatience Where is hewhere is
he

At the sound of this voice Dagobert seemed to rouse himself with a
start made a sudden bound and with a loud cry rushed towards the
door It opened Marshal Simon appeared on the threshold




CHAPTER XXXIX PIERRE SIMON

Marshal Pierre Simon Duke de Ligny was a man of tall stature plainly
dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the throat with a red
ribbon tied to the top buttonhole You could not have wished to see
a more frank honest and chivalrous cast of countenance than the
marshals He had a broad forehead an aquiline nose a well formed
chin and a complexion bronzed by exposure to the Indian sun His hair
cut very short was inclined to gray about the temples but his eyebrows
were still as black as his large hanging moustache His walk was free
and bold and his decided movements showed his military impetuosity A
man of the people a man of war and action the frank cordiality of
his address invited friendliness and sympathy As enlightened as he was
intrepid as generous as he was sincere his manly plebeian pride was
the most remarkable part of his character As others are proud of their
high birth so was he of his obscure origin because it was ennobled by
the fine qualities of his father the rigid republican the intelligent
and laborious artisan who for the space of forty years had been the
example and the glory of his fellowworkmen In accepting with gratitude
the aristocratic title which the Emperor had bestowed upon him Pierre
Simon acted with that delicacy which receives from a friendly hand a
perfectly useless gift and estimates it according to the intention of
the giver The religious veneration of Pierre Simon for the Emperor had
never been blind in proportion as his devotion and love for his idol
were instructive and necessary his admiration was serious and founded
upon reason Far from resembling those swashbucklers who love fighting
for its own sake Marshal Simon not only admired his hero as the
greatest captain in the world but he admired him above all because he
knew that the Emperor had only accepted war in the hope of one day being
able to dictate universal peace for if peace obtained by glory and
strength is great fruitful and magnificent peace yielded by weakness
and cowardice is sterile disastrous and dishonoring The son of a
workman Pierre Simon still further admired the Emperor because that
imperial parvenu had always known how to make that popular heart beat
nobly and remembering the people from the masses of whom he first
arose had invited them fraternally to share in regal and aristocratic
pomp

When Marshal Simon entered the room his countenance was much agitated
At sight of Dagobert a flash of joy illumined his features he rushed
towards the soldier extending his arms and exclaimed My friend my
old friend

Dagobert answered this affectionate salute with silent emotion Then the
marshal disengaging himself from his arms and fixing his moist eyes
upon him said to him in so agitated a voice that his lips trembled
Well didst arrive in time for the 13th of February

Yes general but everything is postponed for four months

Andmy wifemy child At this question Dagobert shuddered hung
down his head and was silent

They are not then here asked Simon with more surprise than
uneasiness They told me they were not at your house but that I should
find you hereand I came immediately Are they not with you

General said Dagobert becoming deadly pale general Drying
the drops of cold sweat that stood upon his forehead he was unable to
articulate a word for his voice was checked in his parched throat

You frighten me exclaimed Pierre Simon becoming pale as the soldier
and seizing him by the arm

At this Adrienne advanced with a countenance full of grief and
sympathy seeing the cruel embarrassment of Dagobert she wished to come
to his assistance and she said to Pierre Simon in a mild but agitated
voice Marshal I am Mdlle de Cardovillea relation of your dear
children

Pierre Simon turned around suddenly as much struck with the dazzling
beauty of Adrienne as with the words she had just pronounced He
stammered out in his surprise You madamea relationof my
children

He laid a stress on the last words and looked at Dagobert in a kind of
stupor

Yes marshal your children hastily replied Adrienne and the love of
those charming twin sisters

Twin sisters cried Pierre Simon interrupting Mdlle de Cardoville
with an outburst of joy impossible to describe Two daughters instead
of one Oh what happiness for their mother Pardon me madame for
being so impolite he continued and so little grateful for what you
tell me But you will understand it I have been seventeen years without
seeing my wife I come and I find three loved beings instead of two
Thanks madame would I could express all the gratitude I owe you You
are our relation this is no doubt your house my wife and children
are with you Is it so You think that my sudden appearance might be
prejudicial to them I will waitbut madame you that I am certain
are good as fairpity my impatiencewill make haste to prepare them to
receive me

More and more agitated Dagobert avoided the marshals gaze and
trembled like a leaf Adrienne cast down her eyes without answering
Her heart sunk within her at thought of dealing the terrible blow to
Marshal Simon

The latter astonished at this silence looking at Adrienne then at
the soldier became first uneasy and at last alarmed Dagobert he
exclaimed something is concealed from me

General stammered the soldier I assure youII

Madame cried Pierre Simon I conjure you in pity speak to me
franklymy anxiety is horrible My first fears return upon me What
is it Are my wife and daughters ill Are they in danger Oh speak
speak

Your daughters marshal said Adrienne have been rather unwell since
their long journeybut they are in no danger

Oh heaven it is my wife

Have courage sir said Mdlle de Cardoville sadly Alas you must
seek consolation in the affection of the two angels that remain to you

General said Dagobert in a firm grave tone I returned from
Siberiaalone with your two daughters

And their mother their mother cried Simon in a voice of despair

I set out with the two orphans the day after her death said the
soldier

Dead exclaimed Pierre Simon overwhelmed by the stroke dead A
mournful silence was the only answer The marshal staggered beneath this
unexpected shock leaned on the back of a chair for support and then
sinking into the seat concealed his face with his hands For same
minutes nothing was heard but stifled sobs for not only had Pierre
Simon idolized his wife but by one of those singular compromises that
a man long cruelly tried sometimes makes with destiny Pierre Simon
with the fatalism of loving souls thought he had a right to reckon upon
happiness after so many years of suffering and had not for a moment
doubted that he should find his wife and childa double consolation
reserved to him after going through so much Very different from certain
people whom the habit of misfortune renders less exacting Simon had
reckoned upon happiness as complete as had been his misery His wife and
child were the sole indispensable conditions of this felicity and had
the mother survived her daughters she would have no more replaced them
in his eyes than they did her Weakness or avarice of the heart so it
was we insist upon this singularity because the consequences of these
incessant and painful regrets exercised a great influence on the
future life of Marshal Simon Adrienne and Dagobert had respected the
overwhelming grief of this unfortunate man When he had given a free
course to his tears he raised his manly countenance now of marble
paleness drew his hand across his bloodshot eyes rose and said to
Adrienne Pardon me madame I could not conquer my first emotion
Permit me to retire I have cruel details to ask of the worthy friend
who only quitted my wife at the last moment Have the kindness to let
me see my childrenmy poor orphans And the marshals voice again
broke

Marshal said Mdlle de Cardoville just now we were expecting your
dear children unfortunately we have been deceived in our hopes
Pierre Simon first looked at Adrienne without answering as if he had
not heard or understoodBut console yourself resumed the young
girl we have yet no reason to despair

To despair repeated the marshaling by turns at Mdlle de Cardoville
despairof what in heavens name

Of seeing your children marshal said Adrienne the presence of
their father will facilitate the search

The search cried Pierre Simon Then my daughters are not here

No sir said Adrienne at length they have been taken from the
affectionate care of the excellent man who brought them from Russia to
be removed to a convent

Wretch cried Pierre Simon advancing towards Dagobert with a
menacing and terrible aspect you shall answer to me for all

Oh sir do not blame him cried Mdlle de Cardoville

General said Dagobert in a tone of mournful resignation I merit
your anger It is my fault Forced to absent myself from Paris I
entrusted the children to my wife her confessor turned her head and
persuaded her that your daughters would be better in a convent than at
our house She believed him and let them be conveyed there Now they
say at the convent that they do not know where they are This is the
truth do what you will with me I have only to silently endure

This is infamous cried Pierre Simon pointing to Dagobert with a
gesture of despairing indignation In whom can a man confide if he has
deceived me Oh my God

Stay marshal do not blame him repeated Mdlle de Cardoville do
not think so He has risked life and honor to rescue your children from
the convent He is not the only one who has failed in this attempt Just
now a magistratedespite his character and authoritywas not more
successful His firmness towards the superior his minute search of the
convent were all in vain Up to this time it has been impossible to
find these unfortunate children

But wheres this convent cried Marshal Simon raising his head his
face all pale and agitated with grief and rage Where is it Do these
vermin know what a father is deprived of his children At the moment
when Marshal Simon turning towards Dagobert pronounced these words
Rodin holding Rose and Blanche by the hand appeared at the open door
of the chamber On hearing the marshals exclamation he started with
surprise and a flash of diabolical joy lit up his grim countenancefor
he had not expected to meet Pierre Simon so opportunely

Mdlle de Cardoville was the first to perceive the presence of Rodin
She exclaimed as she hastened towards him Oh I was not deceived He
is still our providence

My poor children said Rodin in a low voice to the young girls as
he pointed to Pierre Simon this is your father

Sir cried Adrienne following close upon Rose and Blanche Your
children are here

As Simon turned round abruptly his two daughters threw themselves into
his arms Here was a long silence broken only by sobs and kisses and
exclamations of joy

Come forward at least and enjoy the good you have done said Mdlle
de Cardoville drying her eyes and turning towards Rodin who leaning
against the door seemed to contemplate this scene with deep emotion

Dagobert at sight of Rodin bringing back the children was at first
struck with stupor and unable to move a step but hearing the words of
Adrienne and yielding to a burst of almost insane gratitude he threw
himself on his knees before the Jesuit joined his hands together and
exclaimed in a broken voice You have saved me by bringing back these
children

Oh bless you sir said Mother Bunch yielding to the general
current

My good friends this is too much said Rodin as if his emotions were
beyond his strength this is really too much for me Excuse me to the
marshal and tell him that I am repaid by the sight of his happiness

Pray sir said Adrienne let the marshal at least have the
opportunity to see and know you

Oh remain you that have saved us all cried Dagobert trying to stop
Rodin

Providence you know my dear young lady does not trouble itself about
the good that is done but the good that remains to do said Rodin
with an accent of playful kindness Must I not think of Prince Djalma
My task is not finished and moments are precious Come he added
disengaging himself gently from Dagoberts hold come the day has been
as good a one as I had hoped The Abbe dAigrigny is unmasked you
are free my dear young lady you have recovered your cross my brave
soldier Mother Bunch is sure of a protectress the marshal has found
his children I have my share in all these joys it is a full sharemy
heart is satisfied Adieu my friends till we meet again So saying
Rodin waved his hand affectionately to Adrienne Dagobert and the
hunchback and withdrew waving his hand with a look of delight on
Marshal Simon who seated between his daughters held them in his arms
and covered them with tears and kisses remaining quite indifferent to
all that was passing around him

An hour after this scene Mdlle de Cardoville and the sempstress
Marshal Simon his two daughters and Dagobert quitted Dr Beleiniers
asylum

In terminating this episode a few words by way of moral with regard to
lunatic asylums and convents may not be out of place We have said and
we repeat that the laws which apply to the superintendence of lunatic
asylums appear to us insufficient Facts that have recently transpired
before the courts and other facts that have been privately communicated
to us evidently prove this insufficiency Doubtless magistrates have
full power to visit lunatic asylums They are even required to make
such visits But we know from the best authority that the numerous
and pressing occupations of magistrates whose number is often out of
proportion with the labor imposed upon them render these inspections so
rare that they are so to speak illusory It appears therefore to us
advisable to institute a system of inspections at least twice a month
especially designed for lunatic asylums and entrusted to a physician
and a magistrate so that every complaint may be submitted to a double
examination Doubtless the law is sufficient when its ministers are
fully informed but how many formalities how many difficulties must be
gone through before they can be so particularly when the unfortunate
creature who needs their assistance already suspected isolated and
imprisoned has no friend to come forward in defence and demand in his
or her name the protection of the authorities Is it not imperative
therefore on the civil power to meet these necessities by a periodical
and wellorganized system of inspection

What we here say of lunatic asylums will apply with still greater force
to convents for women seminaries and houses inhabited by religious
bodies Recent and notorious facts with which all France has rung
have unfortunately proved that violence forcible detention barbarous
usage abduction of minors and illegal imprisonment accompanied by
torture are occurrences which if not frequent are at least possible
in religious houses It required singular accidents audacious and
cynical brutalities to bring these detestable actions to public
knowledge How many other victims have been and perhaps still are
entombed in those large silent mansions where no profane look may
penetrate and which through the privileges of the clergy escape the
superintendence of the civil power Is it not deplorable that these
dwellings should not also be subject to periodical inspection by
visitors consisting if it be desired of a priest a magistrate and
some delegate of the municipal authorities If nothing takes place but
what is legal human and charitable in these establishments which
have all the character and incur all the responsibility of public
institutions why this resistance this furious indignation of the
church party when any mention is made of touching what they call their
privileges There is something higher than the constitutions devised
at Rome We mean the Law of Francethe common lawwhich grants to all
protection but which in return exacts from all respect and obedience

CHAPTER XL THE EAST INDIAN IN PARIS

Since three days Mdlle de Cardoville had left Dr Baleiniers The
following scene took place in a little dwelling in the Rue Blanche to
which Djalma had been conducted in the name of his unknown protector
Fancy to yourself a pretty circular apartment hung with Indian
drapery with purple figures on a gray ground just relieved by a
few threads of gold The ceiling towards the centre is concealed by
similar hangings tied together by a thick silken cord the two ends
of this cord unequal in length terminated instead of tassels in two
tiny Indian lamps of gold filigreedwork marvellously finished By one
of those ingenious combinations so common in barbarous countries
these lamps served also to burn perfumes Plates of blue crystal let
in between the openings of the arabesque and illumined by the interior
light shone with so limpid an azure that the golden lamps seemed
starred with transparent sapphires Light clouds of whitish vapor rose
incessantly from these lamps and spread all around their balmy odor

Daylight was only admitted to this room it was about two oclock in the
afternoon through a little greenhouse on the other side of a door of
plateglass made to slide into the thickness of the wall by means of a
groove A Chinese shade was arranged so as to hide or replace this
glass at pleasure Some dwarf palm tress plantains and other Indian
productions with thick leaves of a metallic green arranged in clusters
in this conservatory formed as it were the background to two large
variegated bushes of exotic flowers which were separated by a narrow
path paved with yellow and blue Japanese tiles running to the foot of
the glass The daylight already much dimmed by the leaves through which
it passed took a hue of singular mildness as it mingled with the azure
lustre of the perfumed lamps and the crimson brightness of the fire
in the tall chimney of oriental porphyry In the obscurity of this
apartment impregnated with sweet odors and the aromatic vapor of
Persian tobacco a man with brown hanging locks dressed in a long robe
of dark green fastened round the waist by a particolored sash was
kneeling upon a magnificent Turkey carpet filling the golden bowl of
a hookah the long flexible tube of this pipe after rolling its folds
upon the carpet like a scarlet serpent with silver scales rested
between the slender fingers of Djalma who was reclining negligently on
a divan The young prince was bareheaded his jetblack hair parted on
the middle of his forehead streamed waving about his face and neck of
antique beautytheir warm transparent colors resembling amber or topaz
Leaning his elbow on a cushion he supported his chin with the palm of
his right hand The flowing sleeve of his robe falling back from his
arm which was round as that of a woman revealed mysterious signs
formerly tattooed there in India by a Thugs needle The son of
Radjasing held in his left hand the amber mouthpiece of his pipe His
robe of magnificent cashmere with a border of a thousand hues reaching
to his knee was fastened about his slim and wellformed figure by the
large folds of an orangecolored shawl This robe was half withdrawn
from one of the elegant legs of this Asiatic Antinous clad in a kind
of very close fitting gaiter of crimson velvet embroidered with silver
and terminating in a small white morocco slipper with a scarlet heel
At once mild and manly the countenance of Djalma was expressive of that
melancholy and contemplative calmness habitual to the Indian and the
Arab who possess the happy privilege of uniting by a rare combination
the meditative indolence of the dreamer with the fiery energy of the
man of actionnow delicate nervous impressionable as womennow
determined ferocious and sanguinary as bandits

And this semifeminine comparison applicable to the moral nature of the
Arab and the Indian so long as they are not carried away by the ardor
of battle and the excitement of carnage is almost equally applicable to
their physical constitution for if like women of good blood they have
small extremities slender limbs fine and supple forms this delicate
and often charming exterior always covers muscles of steel full of an
elasticity and vigor truly masculine Djalmas oblong eyes like black
diamonds set in bluish motherofpearl wandered mechanically from the
exotic flowers to the ceiling from time to time he raised the amber
mouthpiece of the hookah to his lips then after a slow aspiration
half opening his rosy lips strongly contrasted with the shining enamel
of his teeth he sent forth a little spiral line of smoke freshly
scented by the rosewater through which it had passed

Shall I put more tobacco in the hookah said the kneeling figure
turning towards Djalma and revealing the marked and sinister features
of Faringhea the Strangler

The young prince remained dumb either that from an oriental contempt
for certain races he disdained to answer the halfcaste or that
absorbed in his reverie he did not even hear him The Strangler became
again silent crouching crosslegged upon the carpet with his elbows
resting on his knees and his chin upon his hands he kept his eyes
fixed on Djalma and seemed to await the reply or the orders of him
whose sire had been surnamed the Father of the Generous How had
Faringhea the sanguinary worshipper of Bowanee the Divinity of Murder
been brought to seek or to accept such humble functions How came this
man possessed of no vulgar talents whose passionate eloquence and
ferocious energy had recruited many assassins for the service of the
Good Work to resign himself to so base a condition Why too had
this man who profiting by the young princes blindness with regard
to himself might have so easily sacrificed him as an offering to
Bowaneewhy had he spared the life of Radjasings son Why in fine
did he expose himself to such frequent encounters with Rodin whom he
had only known under the most unfavorable auspices The sequel of this
story will answer all these questions We can only say at present
that after a long interview with Rodin two nights before the Thug had
quitted him with downcast eyes and cautious bearing

After having remained silent for some time Djalma following with his
eye the cloud of whitish smoke that he had just sent forth into space
addressed Faringhea without looking at him and said to him in the
language as hyperbolical as concise of Orientals Time passes The
old man with the good heart does not come But he will come His word is
his word

His word is his word my lord repeated Faringhea in an affirmative
tone When he came to fetch you three days ago from the house whither
those wretches in furtherance of their wicked designs had conveyed you
in a deep sleepafter throwing me your watchful and devoted servant
into a similar statehe said to you The unknown friend who sent for
you to Cardoville Castle bids me come to you prince Have confidence
and follow me A worthy abode is prepared for youAnd again he said
to you my lord Consent not to leave the house until my return Your
interest requires it In three days you will see me again and then be
restored to perfect freedom You consented to those terms my lord and
for three days you have not left the house

And I wait for the old man with impatience said Djalma for this
solitude is heavy with me There must be so many things to admire in
Paris Above all

Djalma did not finish the sentence but relapsed into a reverie After
some moments silence the son of Radjasing said suddenly to Faringhea
in the tone of an impatient yet indolent sultan Speak to me

Of what shall I speak my lord

Of what you will said Djalma with careless contempt as he fixed
on the ceiling his eyes halfveiled with languor One thought pursues
meI wish to be diverted from it Speak to me

Faringhea threw a piercing glance on the countenance of the young
Indian and saw that his cheeks were colored with a slight blush My
lord said the halfcaste I can guess your thought

Djalma shook his head without looking at the Strangler The latter
resumed You are thinking of the women of Paris my lord

Be silent slave said Djalma turning abruptly on the sofa as if
some painful wound had been touched to the quick Faringhea obeyed

After the lapse of some moments Djalma broke forth again with
impatience throwing aside the tube of the hookah and veiling both
eyes with his hands Your words are better than silence Cursed be my
thoughts and the spirit which calls up these phantoms

Why should you fly these thoughts my lord You are nineteen years of
age and hitherto all your youth has been spent in war and captivity
Up to this time you have remained as chaste as Gabriel that young
Christian priest who accompanied us on our voyage

Though Faringhea did not at all depart from his respectful deference
for the prince the latter felt that there was something of irony in the
tone of the halfcaste as he pronounced the word chaste

Djalma said to him with a mixture of pride and severity I do not wish
to pass for a barbarian as they call us with these civilized people
therefore I glory in my chastity

I do not understand my lord

I may perhaps love some woman pure as was my mother when she married
my father and to ask for purity from a woman a man must be chaste as
she

At this Faringhea could not refrain from a sardonic smile

Why do you laugh slave said the young prince imperiously

Among civilized people as you call them my lord the man who married
in the flower of his innocence would be mortally wounded with ridicule

It is false slave He would only be ridiculous if he married one that
was not pure as himself

Then my lord he would not only be woundedhe would be killed
outright for he would be doubly and unmercifully laughed at

It is false it is false Where did you learn all this

I have seen Parisian women at the Isle of France and at Pondicherry
my lord Moreover I learned a good deal during our voyage I talked
with a young officer while you conversed with the young priest

So like the sultans of our harems civilized men require of women the
innocence they have themselves lost

They require it the more the less they have of it my lord

To require without any return is to act as a master to his slave by
what right

By the right of the strongestas it is among us my lord

And what do the women do

They prevent the men from being too ridiculous when they marry in the
eyes of the world

But they kill a woman that is false said Djalma raising himself
abruptly and fixing upon Faringhea a savage look that sparkled with
lurid fire

They kill her my lord as with uswhen they find her out

Despots like ourselves Why then do these civilized men not shut up
their women to force them to a fidelity which they do not practise

Because their civilization is barbarous and their barbarism civilized
my lord

All this is sad enough if true observed Djalma with a pensive air
adding with a species of enthusiasm employing as usual the mystic
and figurative language familiar to the people of his country yes
your talk afflicts me slavefor two drops of dew blending in the cup
of a flower are as hearts that mingle in a pure and virgin love and two
rays of light united in one inextinguishable flame are as the burning
and eternal joys of lovers joined in wedlock

Djalma spoke of the pure enjoyments of the soul with inexpressible
grace yet it was when he painted less ideal happiness that his eyes
shone like stars he shuddered slightly his nostrils swelled the pale
gold of his complexion became vermilion and the young prince sank into
a deep reverie

Faringhea having remarked this emotion thus spoke If like the proud
and brilliant kingbird of our woods you prefer numerous and varied
pleasures to solitary and monotonous amourshandsome young rich
as you are my lord were you to seek out the seductive
Parisiansvoluptuous phantoms of your nightscharming tormentors
of your dreamswere you to cast upon them looks bold as a challenge
supplicating as prayers ardent as desiresdo you not think that many
a halfveiled eye would borrow fire from your glance Then it would no
longer be the monotonous delights of a single love the heavy chain of
our lifeno it would be the thousand pleasures of the harema harem
peopled with free and proud beauties whom happy love would make your
slaves So long constrained there is no such thing as excess to you
Believe me it would then be you the ardent the magnificent son of our
country that would become the love and pride of these womenthe most
seductive in the world who would soon have for you no looks but those
of languor and passion

Djalma had listened to Faringhea with silent eagerness The expression
of his features had completely changed it was no longer the melancholy
and dreaming youth invoking the sacred remembrance of his mother
and finding only in the dew of heaven in the calyx of flowers images
sufficiently pure to paint the chastity of the love he dreamed of it
was no longer even the young man blushing with a modest ardor at the
thought of the permitted joys of a legitimate union No the incitements
of Faringhea had kindled a subterraneous fire the inflamed countenance
of Djalma his eyes now sparkling and now veiled his manly and sonorous
respiration announced the heat of his blood the boiling up of
the passions only the more energetic that they had been hitherto
restrained

So springing suddenly from the divan supple vigorous and light as
a young tiger Djalma clutched Faringhea by the throat exclaiming Thy
words are burning poison

My lord said Faringhea without opposing the least resistance your
slave is your slave This submission disarmed the prince

My life belongs to you repeated the halfcaste

I belong to you slave cried Djalma repulsing him Just now I hung
upon your lips devouring your dangerous lies

Lies my lord Only appear before these women and their looks will
confirm my words

These women love meme who have only lived in war and in the woods

The thought that you so young have already waged bloody war on men
and tigers will make them adore my lord

You lie

I tell you my lord on seeing your hand as delicate as theirs but
which has been so often bathed in hostile blood they will wish to
caress it and they will kiss it again when they think that in our
forests with loaded rifle and a poniard between your teeth you smiled
at the roaring of a lion or panther for whom you lay in wait

But I am a savagea barbarian

And for that very reason you will have them at your feet They will
feel themselves both terrified and charmed by all the violence and fury
the rage of jealousy the passion and the love to which a man of your
blood your youth your ardor must be subject Today mild and tender
tomorrow fierce and suspicious another time ardent and passionate
such you will beand such you ought to be if you wish to win them
Yes let a kiss of rage be heard between two kisses let a dagger
glitter in the midst of caresses and they will fall before you
palpitating with pleasure love and fearand you will be to them not
a man but a god

Dost think so cried Djalma carried away in spite of himself by the
Thugs wild eloquence

You know you feel that I speak the truth cried the latter
extending his arm towards the young Indian

Why yes exclaimed Djalma his eyes sparkling his nostrils swelling
as he moved about the apartment with savage bounds I know not if I
possess my reason or if I am intoxicated but it seems to me that you
speak truth Yes I feel that they will love me with madness and fury
because my love will be mad and furious they will tremble with pleasure
and fear because the very thought of it makes me tremble with delight
and terror Slave it is true there is something exciting and fearful
in such a love As he spoke forth these words Djalma was superb in his
impetuous sensuality It is a rare thing to see a young man arrive
in his native purity at the age in which are developed in all their
powerful energy those admirable instincts of love which God has
implanted in the heart of his creatures and which repressed
disguised or perverted may unseat the reason or generate mad excesses
and frightful crimesbut which directed towards a great and noble
passion may and must by their very violence elevate man through
devotion and tenderness to the limits of the ideal

Oh this womanthis woman before whom I am to trembleand who
in turn must tremble before mewhere is she cried Djalma with
redoubled excitement Shall I ever find her

One is a good deal my lord replied Faringhea with his sardonic
coolness he who looks for one woman will rarely succeed in this
country he who seeks women is only at a loss to choose

As the halfcaste made this impertinent answer to Djalma a very elegant
blueandwhite carriage stopped before the gardengate of the house
which opened upon a deserted street It was drawn by a pair of beautiful
bloodhorses of a cream color with black manes and tails The
scutcheons on the harness were of silver as were also the buttons of
the servants livery which was blue with white collars On the blue
hammercloth also laced with white as well as on the panels of the
doors were lozengeshaped coats of arms without crest or coronet as
usually borne by unmarried daughters of noble families Two women were
in this carriageMdlle de Cardoville and Florine




CHAPTER XLI RISING

To explain the arrival of Mdlle de Cardoville at the gardendoor of
the house occupied by Djalma we must cast a retrospective glance at
previous events On leaving Doctor Baleiniers Mdlle de Cardoville had
gone to take up her residence in the Rue dAnjou During the last few
months of her stay with her aunt Adrienne had secretly caused this
handsome dwelling to be repaired and furnished and its luxury
and elegance were now increased by all the wonders of the lodge of
SaintDizier House The world found it very strange that a lady of the
age and condition of Mdlle de Cardoville should take the resolution of
living completely alone and free and in fact of keeping house exactly
like a bachelor a young widow or an emancipated minor The world
pretended not to know that Mdlle de Cardoville possessed what is often
wanting in men whether of age or twice of agea firm character a
lofty mind a generous heart strong and vigorous good sense

Judging that she would require faithful assistance in the internal
management of her house Adrienne had written to the bailiff of
Cardoville and his wife old family servants to come immediately to
Paris M Dupont thus filled the office of steward and Mme Dupont
that of housekeeper An old friend of Adriennes father the Count de
Montbron an accomplished old man once very much in fashion and still
a connoisseur in all sorts of elegances had advised Adrienne to act
like a princess and take an equerry recommended for this office a man
of good rearing and ripe age who himself an amateur in horses had
been ruined in England at Newmarket the Derby and Tattersalls and
reduced as sometimes happened to gentlemen in that country to drive
the stage coaches thus finding an honest method of earning his bread
and at the same time gratifying his taste for horses Such was M de
Bonneville M de Montbrons choice Both from age and habits this
equerry could accompany Mdlle de Cardoville on horseback and better
than any one else superintend the stable He accepted therefore the
employment with gratitude and thanks to his skill and attention the
equipages of Mdlle de Cardoville were not eclipsed in style by anything
of the kind in Paris Mdlle de Cardoville had taken back her women
Hebe Georgette and Florine The latter was at first to have reentered
the service of the Princess de SaintDizier to continue her part of spy
for the superior of St Marys Convent but in consequence of the new
direction given by Rodin to the Rennepont affair it was decided
that Florine if possible should return to the service of Mdlle de
Cardoville This confidential place enabling this unfortunate creature
to render important and mysterious services to the people who held her
fate in their hands forced her to infamous treachery Unfortunately
all things favored this machination We know that Florine in her
interview with Mother Bunch a few days after Mdlle de Cardoville was
imprisoned at Dr Baleiniers had yielded to a twinge of remorse
and given to the sempstress advice likely to be of use to Adriennes
interestssending word to Agricola not to deliver to Madame de Saint
Dizier the papers found in the hidingplace of the pavilion but only
to entrust them to Mdlle de Cardoville herself The latter afterwards
informed of these details by Mother Bunch felt a double degree of
confidence and interest in Florine took her back into her service
with gratitude and almost immediately charged her with a confidential
missionthat of superintending the arrangements of the house hired for
Djalmas habitation As for Mother Bunch yielding to the solicitations
of Mdlle de Cardoville and finding she was no longer of use to
Dagoberts wife of whom we shall speak hereafter she had consented to
take up her abode in the hotel on the Rue dAnjou along with Adrienne
who with that rare sagacity of the heart peculiar to her entrusted
the young sempstress who served her also as a secretary with the
department of almsgiving

Mdlle de Cardoville had at first thought of entertaining her merely
as a friend wishing to pay homage in her person to probity with labor
resignation in sorrow and intelligence in poverty but knowing
the workgirls natural dignity she feared with reason that
notwithstanding the delicate circumspection with which the hospitality
would be offered Mother Bunch might perceive in it alms in disguise
Adrienne preferred therefore whilst she treated her as a friend to
give her a confidential employment In this manner the great delicacy of
the needlewoman would be spared since she could earn her livelihood by
performing duties which would at the same time satisfy her praiseworthy
instincts of charity In fact she could fulfil better than any one
the sacred mission confided to her by Adrienne Her cruel experience in
misfortune the goodness of her angelic soul the elevation of her mind
her rare activity her penetration with regard to the painful secrets
of poverty her perfect knowledge of the industrial classes were
sufficient security for the tact and intelligence with which the
excellent creature would second the generous intentions of Mdlle de
Cardoville

Let us now speak of the divers events which on that day preceded the
coming of Mdlle de Cardoville to the gardengate of the house in the
Rue Blanche About ten oclock in the morning the blinds of Adriennes
bedchamber closely shut admitted no ray of daylight to this apartment
which was only lighted by a spherical lamp of oriental alabaster
suspended from the ceiling by three long silver chains This apartment
terminating in a dome was in the form of a tent with eight sides From
the ceiling to the floor it was hung with white silk covered with
long draperies of muslin fastened in large puffs to the wall by bands
caught in at regular distances by plates of ivory Two doors also
of ivory admirably encrusted with motherofpearl led one to the
bathroom the other to the toiletchamber a sort of little temple
dedicated to the worship of beauty and furnished as it had been at the
pavilion of Saint Dizier House Two other compartments of the wall were
occupied by windows completely veiled with drapery Opposite the bed
enclosing splendid firedogs of chased silver was a chimneypiece
of white marble like crystallized snow on which were sculptured two
magnificent caryatides and a frieze representing birds and flowers
Above this frieze carved in openwork with extreme delicacy was a
marble basket filled with red camellias Their leaves of shining
green their flowers of a delicate rosy hue were the only colors that
disturbed the harmonious whiteness of this virgin retreat Finally half
surrounded by waves of white muslin which poured down from the dome
like a mass of light clouds the bed was visiblevery low and resting
on feet of carved ivory which stood upon the ermine carpet that covered
the floor With the exception of a plinth also in ivory admirably
inlaid with motherofpearl the bed was entirely covered with white
satin wadded and quilted like an immense scentbag The cambric sheets
trimmed with lace being a little disturbed on one side discovered the
corner of a white taffety mattress and a light counterpane of watered
stufffor an equal temperature always reigned in this apartment warm
as a fine spring day

From a singular scruple arising from the same sentiment which had
caused Adrienne to have inscribed on a masterpiece of goldsmiths work
the name of the maker instead of that of the seller she had wished all
these articles so costly and sumptuous to be manufactured by workmen
chosen amongst the most intelligent honest and industrious of their
class whom she had supplied with the necessary materials In this
manner she had been able to add to the price of the work the profit
usually gained by the middle man who speculates in such labor this
notable augmentation of wages had spread happiness and comfort through a
hundred necessitous families who blessing the munificence of Adrienne
gave her as she said the right to enjoy her luxury as a good action
Nothing could be fresher or more charming than the interior of this
bedchamber Mdlle de Cardoville had just awoke she reposed in the
middle of this flood of muslin lace cambric and white silk in a
position full of sweet grace Never during the night did she cover that
beautiful golden hair a certain recipe said the Greeks for preserving
it for a long while in magnificence Every evening her women arranged
her long silky curls in flat tresses forming two broad bands which
descending sufficiently low almost entirely to conceal the small ear
the rosy lobe of which was alone visible were joined to the large plait
behind the head

This headdress borrowed from Greek antiquity set off to admiration
the pure fine features of Mdlle de Cardoville and made her look so
much younger that instead of eighteen one would hardly have given her
fifteen years of age Gathered thus closely about the temples the hair
lost its transparent and brilliant hues and would have appeared almost
brown but for the golden tints which played here and there amid the
undulations of the tresses Lulled in that morning torpor the warm
languor of which is so favorable to soft reveries Adrienne leaned
with her elbow on the pillow and her head a little on one side
which displayed to advantage the ideal contour of her bared neck and
shoulders her smiling lips moist and rosy were like her cheeks cold
as if they had just been bathed in icewater her snowwhite lids
half veiled the large dark soft eyes which now gazed languidly upon
vacancy and now fixed themselves with pleasure upon the rosy flowers
and green leaves in the basket of camellias Who can paint the matchless
serenity of Adriennes awakingwhen the fair and chaste soul roused
itself in the fair and chaste body It was the awakening of a heart as
pure as the fresh and balmy breath of youth that made her bosom rise
and fall in its white immaculate purity What creed what dogma what
formula what religious symbol oh paternal and divine Creator can
ever give a more complete idea of Thy harmonious and ineffable power
than the image of a young maiden awaking in the bloom of her beauty
and in all the grace of that modesty with which Thou hast endowed her
seeking in her dreamy innocence for the secret of that celestial
instinct of love which Thou hast placed in the bosom of all Thy
creaturesoh Thou whose love is eternal and goodness infinite

The confused thoughts which since her sleep had appeared gently to
agitate Adrienne absorbed her more and more her head resting on her
bosom her beautiful arm upon the couch her features without becoming
precisely sad assumed an expression of touching melancholy Her dearest
desire was accomplished she was about to live independent and alone
But this affectionate delicate expansive and marvellously complete
nature felt that God had not given her such rare treasures to bury
them in a cold and selfish solitude She felt how much that was great
and beautiful might be inspired by love both in herself and in
him that should be worthy of her Confiding in her courage and the
nobleness of her character proud of the example that she wished to give
to other women knowing that all eyes would be fixed enviously upon her
she felt as it were only too sure of herself far from fearing that
she should make a bad choice she rather feared that she should not
find any from whom to choose so pure and perfect was her taste And
even had she met with her own ideal she had views so singular and
so just so extraordinary and yet so sensible with regard to the
independence and dignity of woman that inexorably determined to make
no concession upon this head she asked herself if the man of her choice
would ever accept the hitherto unheardof conditions that she meant to
impose In recalling to her remembrance the possible suitors that she
had met in the world she remembered also the dark but true picture
which Rodin had drawn with so much caustic bitterness She remembered
too not without a certain pride the encouragement this man had given
her not by flattery but by advising her to follow out and accomplish
a great generous and beautiful design The current or the caprice of
fancy soon brought Adrienne to think of Djalma Whilst she congratulated
herself on having paid to her royal kinsman the duties of a kingly
hospitality the young lady was far from regarding the prince as the
hero of her future

And first she said to herself not unreasonably that this halfsavage
boy with passions if not untamable yet untamed transported on a
sudden into the midst of a refined civilization would be inevitably
destined to fiery trials and violent transformations Now Mdlle de
Cardoville having nothing masculine or despotic in her character had
no wish to civilize the young savage Therefore notwithstanding the
interest or rather because of the interest which she felt for the
young Indian she was firmly resolved not to make herself known to him
till after the lapse of two or three months and she determined also
that even if Djalma should learn by chance that she was his relation
she would not receive his visit She desired if not to try him at
least to leave him free in all his acts so that he might expend the
first fire of his passions good or bad But not wishing to abandon him
quite without defence to the perils of Parisian life she requested the
Count de Montbron in confidence to introduce Prince Djalma to the
best company in Paris and to enlighten him by the counsels of his
long experience M de Montbron had received the request of Mdlle
de Cardoville with the greatest pleasure taking delight he said in
starting his royal tiger in drawingrooms and bringing him into contact
with the flower of the fine ladies and gentlemen of Paris offering at
the same time to wager any amount in favor of his halfsavage pupil

As for myself my dear Count said Adrienne to M de Montbron with
her usual frankness my resolution is not to be shaken You have told
me the effect that will be produced in the fashionable world by the
first appearance of Prince Djalma an Indian nineteen years of age
of surprising beauty proud and wild as a young lion arriving from his
forest it is new it is extraordinary you added and therefore all
the coquetries of civilized life will pursue him with an eagerness which
makes me tremble for him Now seriously my dear count it will not
suit me to appear as the rival of so many fine ladies who are about
to expose themselves intrepidly to the claws of the young tiger I take
great interest in him because he is my cousin because he is handsome
because he is brave and above all because he does not wear that
horrible European dress No doubt these are rare qualitiesbut not
sufficient to make me change my mind Besides the good old philosopher
my new friend has given me advice about this Indian which you my
dear Count who are not a philosopher will yet approve It is for some
time to receive visits at home but not to visit other peoplewhich
will spare me the awkwardness of meeting my royal cousin and allow me
to make a careful choice even amongst my usual society As my house
will be an excellent one my position most unusual and as I shall be
suspected of all sorts of naughty secrets I shall be in no want of
inquisitive visitors who will amuse me a good deal I assure you

And as M de Montbron asked if the exile of the poor young Indian
tiger was to last long Adrienne answered As I shall see most of the
persons to whom you will introduce him I shall be pleased to hear
different opinions about him If certain men speak well of him and
certain women ill I shall have good hope of him In a word the opinion
that I come to in sifting the true from the false you may leave that
to my sagacity will shorten or prolong the exile of my royal cousin

Such were the formal intentions of Mdlle de Cardoville with regard to
Djalma even on the day she went with Florine to the house he occupied
In a word she had positively resolved not to be known to him for some
months to come

After long reflecting that morning on the chances that might yet offer
themselves to satisfy the wants of her heart Adrienne fell into a new
deep reverie This charming creature so full of life and youth heaved
a low sigh raised her arms above her head turned her profile
towards the pillow and remained for some moments as if powerless and
vanquished Motionless beneath the white tissues that wrapped her round
she looked like a fair marble statue visible beneath a light layer
of snow Suddenly Adrienne raised herself up drew her hand across her
brow and rang for her women At the first silver tone of the bell
the two ivory doors opened Georgette appeared on the threshold of the
dressingroom from which Frisky a little black andtan dog with his
golden collar escaped with a joyful barking Hebe appeared at the
same time on the threshold of the bathroom At the further end of this
apartment lighted from above might be seen upon a green mat of Spanish
leather with golden ornaments a crystal bath in the form of a long
shell The three only divisions in this masterpiece of glass work were
concealed by the elegant device of several large reeds in silver
which rose from the wide base of the bath also of wrought silver
representing children and dolphins playing among branches of natural
coral and azure shells Nothing could be more pleasing than the effect
of these purple reeds and ultramarine shells upon a dull ground of
silver the balsamic vapor which rose from the warm limpid and
perfumed water that filled the crystal shell spread through the
bathroom and floated like a light cloud into the sleepingchamber

Seeing Hebe in her fresh and pretty costume bringing her a long bathing
gown hanging upon a bare and dimpled arm Adrienne said to her Where
is Florine my child

Madame she went downstairs two hours ago she was wanted for something
very pressing

Who wanted her

The young person who serves Madame as secretary She went out this
morning very early and as soon as she returned she sent for Florine
who has not come back since

This absence no doubt relates to some important affair of my angelic
minister of succor said Adrienne smiling and thinking of the
hunchback Then she made a sign to Hebe to approach her bed

About two hours after rising Adrienne having had herself dressed
as usual with rare elegance dismissed her women and sent for Mother
Bunch whom she treated with marked deference always receiving her
alone The young sempstress entered hastily with a pale agitated
countenance and said in a trembling voice Oh madame my
presentiments were justified You are betrayed

Of what presentiments do you speak my dear child said Adrienne with
surprise Who betrays me

M Rodin answered the workgirl




CHAPTER XLII DOUBTS

On hearing the accusation brought against Rodin Mdlle de Cardoville
looked at the denunciator with new astonishment Before continuing this
scene we may say that Mother Bunch was no longer clad in her poor old
clothes but was dressed in black with as much simplicity as taste The
sad color seemed to indicate her renunciation of all human vanity the
eternal mourning of her heart and the austere duties imposed upon her
by her devotion to misfortune With her black gown she wore a large
falling collar white and neat as her little gauze cap with its gray
ribbons which revealing her bands of fine brown hair set off to
advantage her pale and melancholy countenance with its soft blue eyes
Her long delicate hands preserved from the cold by gloves were no
longer as formerly of a violet hue but of an almost transparent
whiteness

Her agitated features expressed a lively uneasiness Extremely
surprised Mdlle de Cardoville exclaimed What do you say

M Rodin betrays you madame

M Rodin Impossible

Oh madame my presentiments did not deceive me

Your presentiments

The first time I saw M Rodin I was frightened in spite of myself My
heart sank within me and I trembledfor you madame

For me said Adrienne Why did you not tremble for yourself my poor
friend

I do not know madame but such was my first impression And this fear
was so invincible that notwithstanding the kindness that M Rodin
showed my sister he frightened me none the less

That is strange I can understand as well as any one the almost
irresistible influence of sympathies or aversions but in this
instanceHowever resumed Adrienne after a moments reflection no
matter for that how have these suspicions been changed to certainty

Yesterday I went to take to my sister Cephyse the assistance that M
Rodin had given me in the name of a charitable person I did not find
Cephyse at the friends who had taken care of her I therefore begged
the portress to inform my sister that I would call again this morning
That is what I did but you must excuse me madame some necessary
details

Speak speak my dear

The young girl who had received my sister said Mother Bunch with
embarrassment casting down her eyes and blushing does not lead a very
regular life A person with whom she has gone on several parties of
pleasure one M Dumoulin had informed her of the real name of M
Rodin who has a kind of lodging in that house and there goes by the
name of Charlemagne

That is just what he told us at Dr Baleiniers and the day before
yesterday when I again alluded to the circumstance he explained to
me the necessity in which he was for certain reasons to have a humble
retreat in that remote quarterand I could not but approve of his
motives

Well then yesterday M Rodin received a visit from the Abbe
dAigrigny

The Abbe dAigrigny exclaimed Mdlle de Cardoville

Yes madame he remained for two hours shut up with M Rodin

My child you must have been deceived

I was told madame that the Abbe dAigrigny had called in the morning
to see M Rodin not finding him at home he had left with the portress
his name written on a slip of paper with the words I shall return
in two hours The girl of whom I spoke madame had seen this slip of
paper As all that concerns M Rodin appears mysterious enough she
had the curiosity to wait for M dAigrigny in the porters lodge and
about two hours afterwards he indeed returned and saw M Rodin

No no said Adrienne shuddering it is impossible There must be
some mistake

I think not madame for knowing how serious such a discovery would
be I begged the young girl to describe to me the appearance of M
dAigrigny

Well

The Abbe dAigrigny she told me is about forty years of age He is
tall and upright dresses plainly but with care has gray eyes very
large and piercing thick eyebrows chestnutcolored hair a face
closely shaved and a very decided aspect

It is true said Adrienne hardly able to believe what she heard The
description is exact

Wishing to have all possible details resumed Mother Bunch I asked
the portress if M Rodin and the Abbe dAigrigny appeared to be at
variance when they quitted the house She replied no but that the
Abbe said to M Rodin as they parted at the door I will write to you
tomorrow as agreed

Is it a dream Good heaven said Adrienne drawing her hands across
her forehead in a sort of stupor I cannot doubt your word my poor
friend and yet it is M Rodin who himself sent you to that house to
give assistance to your sister would he have wilfully laid open to you
his secret interviews with the Abbe dAigrigny It would have been bad
policy in a traitor

That is true and the same reflection occurred to me And yet the
meeting of these two men appeared so dangerous to you madame that I
returned home full of terror

Characters of extreme honesty are very hard to convince of the treachery
of others the more infamous the deception the more they are inclined
to doubt it Adrienne was one of these characters rectitude being a
prime quality of her mind Though deeply impressed by the communication
she remarked Come my dear do not let us frighten ourselves too soon
or be overhasty in believing evil Let us try to enlighten ourselves by
reasoning and first of all remember facts M Rodin opened for me the
doors of Dr Baleiniers asylum in my presence he brought his charge
against the Abbe dAigrigny he forced the superior of the convent
to restore Marshal Simons daughters he succeeded in discovering the
retreat of Prince Djalmahe faithfully executed my intentions with
regard to my young cousin only yesterday he gave me the most useful
advice All this is trueis it not

Certainly madame

Now suppose that M Rodin putting things in their worst light
had some afterthoughtthat he hopes to be liberally rewarded for
instance hitherto at least he has shown complete disinterestedness

That also is true madame said poor Mother Bunch obliged like
Adrienne to admit the evidence of fixed facts

Now let us look to the possibility of treachery Unite with the Abbe
dAigrigny to betray me Betray mehow and for what purpose What
have I to fear Is it not the Abbe dAigrigny on the contrary is
it not Madame de SaintDizier who have to render an account for the
injuries they have done me

But then madame how do you explain the meeting of these two men
who have so many motives for mutual aversion May there not be some dark
project still behind Besides madame I am not the only one to think
so

How is that

This morning on my return I was so much agitated that Mdlle Florine
asked me the cause of my trouble I know madame how much she is
devoted to you

Nobody could be more so only recently you yourself informed me of the
signal service she rendered during my confinement at Dr Baleiniers

Well madame this morning on my return thinking it necessary to have
you informed as soon as possible I told all to Mdlle Florine Like
meeven more perhapsshe was terrified at the meeting of Rodin and M
dAigrigny

After a moments reflection she said to me It is I think useless
to disturb my mistress at present it can be of no importance whether
she is informed of this treachery two or three hours sooner or later
during that time I may be able to discover something more I have an
idea which I think a good one Make my excuses to my mistress I shall
soon be back Then Florine sent for a hackneycoach and went out

Florine is an excellent girl said Mdlle de Cardoville with a smile
for further reflection had quite reassured her but on this occasion
I think that her zeal and good heart have deceived her as they have
you my poor friend Do you know that we are two madcaps you and I
not to have thought of one thing which would have put us quite at our
ease

How so madame

The Abbe dAigrigny fears M Rodin he may have sought him out
to entreat his forbearance Do you not find this explanation both
satisfactory and reasonable

Perhaps so madame said Mother Bunch after a moments reflection
yes it is probable But after another silence and as if yielding to
a conviction superior to every possible argument she exclaimed
And yet no believe me madame you are deceived I feel it All
appearances may be against what I affirm yet believe me these
presentiments are too strong not to be true And have you not guessed
the most secret instincts of my heart Why should I not be able to guess
the dangers with which you are menaced

What do you say what have I guessed replied Mdlle de Cardoville
involuntarily impressed by the others tone of conviction and alarm

What have you guessed resumed the latter All the troublesome
susceptibility of an unfortunate creature to whom destiny has decreed a
life apart If I have hitherto been silent it is not from ignorance
of what I owe you Who told you madame that the only way to make me
accept your favors without blushing was to give me some employment
that would enable me to soothe the misfortunes I had so long shared Who
told you when you wished me to have a seat at your table and to treat
as your friend the poor needlewoman in whose person you sought to
honor resignation and honest industrywho told you when I answered
with tears of gratitude and regret that it was not false modesty but
a consciousness of my own ridiculous deformity that made me refuse
your offer Who told you that but for this I should have accepted it
proudly in the name of all my lowborn sisters But you replied to me
with the touching words I understand your refusal my friend it is
not occasioned by false modesty but by a sentiment of dignity that
I love and respect Who told you continued the workgirl with
increasing animation that I should be so happy to find a little
solitary retreat in this magnificent house which dazzles me with its
splendor Who guided you in the choice of the apartment still far
too good that you have provided for me Who taught you that without
envying the beauty of the charming creatures that surround you and whom
I love because they love you I should always feel by an involuntary
comparison embarrassed and ashamed before them Who told you therefore
to send them away whenever you wished to speak with me Yes who
has revealed to you all the painful and secret susceptibilities of a
position like mine Who has revealed them to you God no doubt who in
His infinite majesty creates worlds and yet cares for the poor little
insect hidden beneath the grass And you think that the gratitude of
a heart you have understood so well cannot rise in its turn to the
knowledge of what may be hurtful to you No no lady some people have
the instinct of self preservation others have the still more precious
instinct that enables them to preserve those they love God has given
me this instinct I tell you that you are betrayed And with animated
look and cheeks slightly colored with emotion the speaker laid such
stress upon the last words and accompanied them with such energetic
gesture that Mdlle de Cardoville already shaken by the girls warmth
began almost to share in her apprehensions Then although she had
before learned to appreciate the superior intelligence of this poor
child of the people Mdlle de Cardoville had never till now heard her
friend express herself with so much eloquencean eloquence too that
was inspired by the noblest sentiments This circumstance added to
the impression made upon Adrienne But at the moment she was about to
answer a knock was heard at the door of the room and Florine entered

On seeing the alarmed countenance of her waitingmaid Mdlle de
Cardoville said hastily Well Florine what news Whence come you my
child

From SaintDizier House madame

And why did you go there asked Mdlle de Cardoville with surprise

This morning said Florine glancing at the workgirl madame there
confided to me her suspicions and uneasiness I shared in them The
visit of the Abbe dAigrigny to M Rodin appeared to me very serious
I thought if it should turn out that M Rodin had been during the last
few days to SaintDizier House there would be no longer any doubt of
his treachery

True said Adrienne more and more uneasy Well

As I had been charged to superintend the removal from the lodge I knew
that several things had remained there To obtain admittance I had to
apply to Mrs Grivois I had thus a pretext for returning to the hotel

What next Florine what next

I endeavored to get Mrs Grivois to talk of M Rodin but it was in
vain

She suspected you said the workgirl It was to be anticipated

I asked her continued Florine if they had seen M Rodin at the
hotel lately She answered evasively Then despairing of getting
anything out of her continued Florine I left Mrs Grivois and that
my visit might excite no suspicion I went to the pavilionwhen as I
turn down the avenuewhom do I see why M Rodin himself hastening
towards the little gardendoor wishing no doubt to depart unnoticed by
that way

Madame you hear cried Mother Bunch clasping her hands with a
supplicating air such evidence should convince you

M Rodin at the Princess de SaintDiziers cried Mdlle de
Cardoville whose glance generally so mild now suddenly flashed with
vehement indignation Then she added in a tone of considerable emotion
Continue Florine

At sight of M Rodin I stopped proceeded Florine and keeping a
little on one side I gained the pavilion without being seen I looked
out into the street through the closed blinds and perceived a hackney
coach It was waiting for M Rodin for a minute after he got into it
saying to the coachman No 39 Rue Blanche

The princes exclaimed Mdlle de Cardoville

Yes madame

Yes M Rodin was to see him today said Adrienne reflecting

No doubt he betrays you madame and the prince also the latter will
be made his victim more easily than you

Shame shame cried Mdlle de Cardoville on a sudden as she rose
all her features contracted with painful anger After such a piece
of treachery it is enough to make us doubt of everythingeven of
ourselves

Oh madame is it not dreadful said Mother Bunch shuddering

But then why did he rescue me and mine and accuse the Abbe
dAigrigny wondered Mdlle de Cardoville Of a truth it is enough
to make one lose ones reason It is an abyssbut oh how frightful is
doubt

As I returned said Florine casting a look of affectionate devotion
on her mistress I thought of a way to make all clear but there is not
a minute to lose

What do you mean said Adrienne looking at Florine with surprise

M Rodin will soon be alone with the prince said Florine

No doubt replied Adrienne

The prince always sits in a little room that opens upon a greenhouse
It is there that he will receive M Rodin

What then resumed Adrienne

This greenhouse which I had arranged according to your orders has
only one issueby a door leading into a little lane The gardener
gets in that way every morning so as not to have to pass through the
apartments Having finished his work he does not return thither during
the day

What do you mean what is your project said Adrienne looking at
Florine with growing surprise

The plants are so disposed that I think if even the shade were
not there which screens the glass that separates the saloon from the
greenhouse one might get near enough to hear what was passing in the
room without being seen When I was superintending the arrangements I
always entered by this greenhouse door The gardener had one key and I
another Luckily I have not yet parted with mine Within an hour you
may know how far to trust M Rodin If he betrays the prince he betrays
you also

What say you cried Mdlle de Cardoville

Set out instantly with me we reach the side door I enter alone for
precaution sakeif all is right I return

You would have me turn spy said Mdlle de Cardoville haughtily
interrupting Florine You cannot think it

I beg your pardon madame said the girl casting down her eyes with
confused and sorrowful air you had suspicions and me seems tis the
only way to confirm or destroy them

Stoop to listen to a conversationnever replied Adrienne

Madame said Mother Bunch suddenly after same moments thought
permit me to tell you that Mdlle Florine is right The plan proposed
is a painful one but it is the only way in which you can clear up
perhaps for ever your doubts as to M Rodin Notwithstanding the
evidence of facts in spite of the almost certainty of my presentiments
appearances may deceive us I was the first who accused M Rodin to you
I should not forgive myself all the rest of my life did I accuse him
wrongfully Beyond doubt it is painful as you say madame to listen
to a conversation Then with a violent effort to console herself she
added as she strove to repress her tears Yet as your safety is
at stake madamefor if this be treachery the future prospect is
dreadfulI will go in your placeto

Not a word more I entreat you cried Mdlle de Cardoville
interrupting Let you my poor friend do for me what I thought
degrading to do myself Never

Then turning to Florine she added Tell M de Bonneville to have the
carriage got ready on the instant

You consent then cried Florine clasping her hands and not seeking
to conceal her joy and her eyes also became full of tears

Yes I consent answered Adrienne with emotion If it is to be
warwar to the knife that they would wage with meI must be prepared
for it and come to think of it it would only be weakness and folly
not to put myself on my guard No doubt this step costs me much and is
very repugnant to me but it is the only way to put an end to suspicions
that would be a continual torment to me and perhaps to prevent still
greater evils Yes for many important reasons this interview of
M Rodin with Prince Djalma may be doubly decisive to meas to the
confidence or the inexorable hate that I must henceforth feel for M
Rodin So Florine quickmy cloak and bonnet and the carriage You
will go with me As for you my dear pray wait for me here she added
turning to the work girl

Half an hour after this conversation Adriennes carriage stopped as
we have before seen at the little gardengate of the house in the
Rue Blanche Florine entered the greenhouse and soon returned to her
mistress The shade is down madame M Rodin has just entered the
princes room Mdlle de Cardoville was therefore present though
invisible at the following scene which took place between Rodin and
Djalma




CHAPTER XLIII THE LETTER

Some minutes before the entrance of Mdlle de Cardoville into the
greenhouse Rodin had been introduced by Faringhea into the presence
of the prince who still under the influence of the burning excitement
into which he had been plunged by the words of the halfcaste did not
appear to perceive the Jesuit The latter surprised at the animated
expression of Djalmas countenance and his almost frantic air made a
sign of interrogation to Faringhea who answered him privately in the
following symbolical mannerAfter laying his forefinger on his head
and heart he pointed to the fire burning in the chimney signifying
by his pantomimic action that the head and heart of Djalma were both
in flames No doubt Rodin understood him for an imperceptible smile of
satisfaction played upon his wan lips then he said aloud to Faringhea
I wish to be alone with the prince Let down the shade and see that we
are not interrupted The halfcaste bowed and touched a spring
near the sheet of plateglass which slid into the wall as the blind
descended then again bowing Faringhea left the room It was shortly
after that Mdlle de Cardoville and Florine entered the greenhouse
which was now only separated from the room in which was Djalma by the
transparent thickness of a shade of white silk embroidered with large
colored birds The noise of the door which Faringhea closed as he went
out seemed to recall the young Indian to himself his features though
still animated recovered their habitual expression of mildness and
gentleness he started drew his hand across his brow looked around
him as if waking up from a deep reverie and then advancing towards
Rodin with an air as respectful as confused he said to him using
the expression commonly applied to old men in his country Pardon me
father Still following the customs of his nation so full of deference
towards age he took Rodins hand to raise it to his lips but the
Jesuit drew back a step and refused his homage

For what do you ask pardon my dear prince said he to Djalma

When you entered I was in a dream I did not come to meet you Once
more pardon me father

Once more I forgive you with all my heart my dear prince But let us
have some talk Pray resume your place on the couch and your pipe too
if you like it

But Djalma instead of adopting the suggestion and throwing himself
on the divan according to his custom insisted on seating himself in a
chair notwithstanding all the persuasions of the Old Man with the Good
Heart as he always called the Jesuit

Really your politeness troubles me my dear prince said Rodin you
are here at home in India at least we wish you to think so

Many things remind me of my country said Djalma in a mild grave
tone Your goodness reminds me of my father and of him who was a
father to me added the Indian as he thought of Marshal Simon whose
arrival in Paris had been purposely concealed from him

After a moments silence he resumed in a tone full of affectionate
warmth as he stretched out his hand to Rodin You are come and I am
happy

I understand your joy my dear prince for I come to take you out of
prisonto open your cage for you I had begged you to submit to a brief
seclusion entirely for your own interest

Can I go out tomorrow

Today my dear prince if you please

The young Indian reflected for a moment and then resumed I must have
friends since I am here in a palace that does not belong to me

Certainly you have friendsexcellent friends answered Rodin At
these words Djalmas countenance seemed to acquire fresh beauty The
most noble sentiments were expressed in his fine features his large
black eyes became slightly humid and after another interval of
silence he rose and said to Rodin with emotion Come

Whither dear prince said the other much surprised

To thank my friends I have waited three days It is long

Permit me dear princeI have much to tell you on this subjectplease
to be seated

Djalma resumed his seat with docility Rodin continued It is true that
you have friends or rather you have a friend Friends are rare

What are you

Well then you have two friends my dear princemyself whom you
know and one other whom you do not know and who desires to remain
unknown to you

Why

Why answered Rodin after a moments embarrassment Because the
happiness he feels in giving you these proofs of his friendship and even
his own tranquillity depend upon preserving this mystery

Why should there be concealment when we do good

Sometimes to conceal the good we do my dear prince

I profit by this friendship why should he conceal himself from one
These repeated questions of the young Indian appeared to puzzle Rodin
who however replied I have told you my dear prince that your
secret friend would perhaps have his tranquillity compromised if he
were known

If he were knownas my friend

Exactly so dear prince

The countenance of Djalma immediately assumed an appearance of sorrowful
dignity he raised his head proudly and said in a stern and haughty
voice Since this friend hides himself from me he must either be
ashamed of me or there is reason for me to be ashamed of him I only
accept hospitality from those who are worthy of me and who think me
worthy of them I leave this house So saying Djalma rose with such
an air of determination that Rodin exclaimed Listen to me my dear
prince Allow me to tell you that your petulance and touchiness are
almost incredible Though we have endeavored to remind you of your
beautiful country we are here in Europe in France in the centre of
Paris This consideration may perhaps a little modify your views Listen
to me I conjure you

Notwithstanding his complete ignorance of certain social
conventionalisms Djalma had too much good sense and uprightness not
to appreciate reason when it appeared reasonable The words of Rodin
calmed him With that ingenuous modesty with which natures full of
strength and generosity are almost always endowed he answered mildly
You are right father I am no longer in my own country Here the
customs are different I will reflect upon it

Notwithstanding his craft and suppleness Rodin sometimes found himself
perplexed by the wild and unforseen ideas of the young Indian Thus he
saw to his great surprise that Djalma now remained pensive for some
minutes after which he resumed in a calm but firm tone I have obeyed
you father I have reflected

Well my dear prince

In no country in the world under no pretext should a man of honor
conceal his friendship for another man of honor

But suppose there should be danger in avowing this friendship said
Rodin very uneasy at the turn the conversation was taking Djalma eyed
the Jesuit with contemptuous astonishment and made no reply

I understand your silence my dear prince a brave man ought to defy
danger True but if it should be you that the danger threatens in
case this friendship were discovered would not your man of honor be
excusable even praiseworthy to persist in remaining unknown

I accept nothing from a friend who thinks me capable of denying him
from cowardice

Dear princelisten to me

Adieu father

Yet reflect

I have said it replied Djalma in an abrupt and almost sovereign
tone as he walked towards the door

But suppose a woman were concerned cried Rodin driven to extremity
and hastening after the young Indian for he really feared that Djalma
might rush from the house and thus overthrow all his projects

At the last words of Rodin the Indian stopped abruptly A woman said
he with a start and turning red A woman is concerned

Why yes suppose it were a woman resumed Rodin would you not then
understand her reserve and the secrecy with which she is obliged to
surround the marks of affection she wishes to give you

A woman repeated Djalma in a trembling voice clasping his hands in
adoration and his beautiful countenance was expressive of the deepest
emotion A woman said he again A Parisian

Yes my dear prince as you force me to this indiscretion I will
confess to you that your friend is a real Parisiana noble matron
endowed with the highest virtueswhose age alone merits all your
respect

She is very old then cried poor Djalma whose charming dream was
thus abruptly dispelled

She may be a few years older than I am answered Rodin with an
ironical smile expecting to see the young man express a sort of comical
disappointment or angry regret

But it was not so To the passionate enthusiasm of love which had for
a moment lighted up the princes features there now succeeded a
respectful and touching expression He looked at Rodin with emotion and
said to him in a broken voice This woman is then a mother to me

It is impossible to describe with what a pious melancholy and tender
charm the Indian uttered the word mother

You have it my dear prince this respectable lady wishes to be a
mother to you But I may not reveal to you the cause of the affection
she feels for you Only believe methis affection is sincere and the
cause honorable If I do not tell you her secret it is that with us
the secrets of women young or old are equally sacred

That is right and I will respect it Without seeing her I will love
heras I love God without seeing Him

And now my dear prince let me tell you what are the intentions of
your maternal friend This house will remain at your disposal as long
as you like it French servants a carriage and horses will be at your
orders the charges of your housekeeping will be paid for you Then as
the son of a king should live royalty I have left in the next room a
casket containing five hundred Louis every month a similar sum will
be provided if it should not be found sufficient for your little
amusements you will tell me and it shall be augmented

At a movement of Djalma Rodin hastened to add I must tell you at
once my dear prince that your delicacy may be quite at ease First
of all you may accept anything from a mother next as in about three
months you will come into possession of an immense inheritance it will
be easy for you if you feel the obligation a burdenand the sum
cannot exceed at the most four or five thousand Louisto repay these
advances Spare nothing then but satisfy all your fancies You are
expected to appear in the great world of Paris in a style becoming the
son of a king who was called the Father of the Generous So once again I
conjure you not to be restrained by a false delicacy if this sum should
not be sufficient

I will ask for more My mother is right the son of a monarch ought to
live royally

Such was the answer of the Indian made with perfect simplicity and
without any appearance of astonishment at these magnificent offers This
was natural Djalma would have done for others what they were doing
for him for the traditions of the prodigal magnificence and splendid
hospitality of Indian princes are well known Djalma had been as moved
as grateful on hearing that a woman loved him with maternal affection
As for the luxury with which she nought to surround him he accepted
it without astonishment and without scruple This resignation again
somewhat disconcerted Rodin who had prepared many excellent arguments
to persuade the Indian to accept his offers

Well then its all agreed my dear prince resumed the Jesuit Now
as you must see the world its just as well to enter by the best door
as we say One of the friends of your maternal protectress the Count de
Montbron an old nobleman of the greatest experience and belonging
to the first society will introduce you in some of the best houses in
Paris

Will you not introduce me father

Alas my dear prince look at me Tell me if you think I am fitted
for such an office No no I live alone and retired from the world
And then added Rodin after a short silence fixing a penetrating
attentive and curious look upon the prince as if he would have
subjected him to a sort of experiment by what follows and then you
see M de Montbron will be better able than I should in the world you
are about to enter to enlighten you as to the snares that will be
laid for you For if you have friends you have also enemiescowardly
enemies as you know who have abused your confidence in an infamous
manner and have made sport of you And as unfortunately their power
is equal to their wickedness it would perhaps be more prudent in you to
try to avoid themto fly instead of resisting them openly

At the remembrance of his enemies at the thought of flying from them
Djalma trembled in every limb his features became of a lurid paleness
his eyes wide open so that the pupil was encircled with white sparkled
with lurid fire never had scorn hatred and the desire of vengeance
expressed themselves so terribly on a human face His upper lip blood
red was curled convulsively exposing a row of small white and close
set teeth and giving to his countenance lately so charming an air of
such animal ferocity that Rodin started from his seat and exclaimed
What is the matter prince You frighten me

Djalma did not answer Half leaning forward with his hands clinched in
rage he seemed to cling to one of the arms of the chair for fear
of yielding to a burst of terrific fury At this moment the amber
mouthpiece of his pipe rolled by chance under one of his feet the
violent tension which contracted all the muscles of the young Indian
was so powerful and notwithstanding his youth and his light figure he
was endowed with such vigor that with one abrupt stamp he powdered to
dust the piece of amber in spite of its extreme hardness

In the name of heaven what is the matter prince cried Rodin

Thus would I crush my cowardly enemies exclaimed Djalma with
menacing and excited look Then as if these words had brought his rage
to a climax he bounded from his seat and with haggard eyes strode
about the room for some seconds in all directions as if he sought
for some weapon and uttered from time to time a hoarse cry which he
endeavored to stifle by thrusting his clinched fist against his mouth
whilst his jaws moved convulsively It was the impotent rage of a wild
beast thirsting for blood Yet in all this the young Indian preserved
a great and savage beauty it was evident that these instincts of
sanguinary ardor and blind intrepidity now excited to this pitch by
horror of treachery and cowardice when applied to war or to those
gigantic Indian hunts which are even more bloody than a battle must
make of Djalma what he really was a hero

Rodin admired with deep and ominous joy the fiery impetuosity
of passion in the young Indian for under various conceivable
circumstances the effect must be terrible Suddenly to the Jesuits
great surprise the tempest was appeased Djalmas fury was calmed thus
instantaneously because refection showed him how vain it was ashamed
of his childish violence he cast down his eyes His countenance
remained pale and gloomy and with a cold tranquillity far more
formidable than the violence to which he had yielded he said to Rodin
Father you will this day lead me to meet my enemies

In what end my dear prince What would you do

Kill the cowards

Kill them you must not think of it

Faringhea will aid me

Remember you are not on the banks of the Ganges and here one does not
kill an enemy like a hunted tiger

One fights with a loyal enemy but one kills a traitor like an accursed
dog replied Djalma with as much conviction as tranquillity

Ah prince whose father was the Father of the Generous said Rodin
in a grave voice what pleasure can you find in striking down creatures
as cowardly as they are wicked

To destroy what is dangerous is a duty

So prince you seek for revenge

I do not revenge myself on a serpent said the Indian with haughty
bitterness I crush it

But my dear prince here we cannot get rid of our enemies in that
manner If we have cause of complaint

Women and children complain said Djalma interrupting Rodin men
strike

Still on the banks of the Ganges my dear prince Here society takes
your cause into its own hands examines judges and if there be good
reason punishes

In my own quarrel I am both judge and executioner

Pray listen to me you have escaped the odious snares of your enemies
have you notWell suppose it were thanks to the devotion of the
venerable woman who has for you the tenderness of a mother and that
she were to ask you to forgive themshe who saved you from their
handswhat would you do then

The Indian hung his head and was silent Profiting by his hesitation
Rodin continued I might say to you that I know your enemies but that
in the dread of seeing you commit some terrible imprudence I would
conceal their names from you forever But no I swear to you that if
the respectable person who loves you as her son should find it either
right or useful that I should tell you their names I will do sountil
she has pronounced I must be silent

Djalma looked at Rodin with a dark and wrathful air At this moment
Faringhea entered and said to Rodin A man with a letter not finding
you at home has been sent on here Am I to receive it He says it comes
from the Abbe dAigrigny

Certainly answered Rodin That is he added with the princes
permission

Djalma nodded in reply Faringhea went out

You will excuse what I have done dear prince I expected this morning
a very important letter As it was late in coming to hand I ordered it
to be sent on

A few minutes after Faringhea returned with the letter which he
delivered to Rodinand the halfcaste again withdrew




CHAPTER XLIV ADRIENNE AND DJALMA

When Faringhea had quitted the room Rodin took the letter from Abbe
dAigrigny with one hand and with the other appeared to be looking
for something first in the side pocket of his greatcoat then in the
pocket behind then in that of his trousers and not finding what he
sought he laid the letter on his knee and felt himself all over with
both hands with an air of regret and uneasiness The divers movements
of this pantomime performed in the most natural manner were crowned by
the exclamations

Oh dear me how vexatious

What is the matter asked Djalma starting from the gloomy silence in
which he had been plunged for some minutes

Alas my dear prince replied Rodin the most vulgar and puerile
accident may sometimes cause the greatest inconvenience I have
forgotten or lost my spectacles Now in this twilight with the very
poor eyesight that years of labor have left me it will be absolutely
impossible for me to read this most important letterand an immediate
answer is expectedmost simple and categoricala yes or a no Times
presses it is really most annoying If added Rodin laying great
stress on his words without looking at Djalma but so as the prince
might remark it if only some one would render me the service to read
it for me but there is no onenoone

Father said Djalma obligingly shall I read it for you When I have
finished it I shall forget what I have read

You cried Rodin as if the proposition of the Indian had appeared
to him extravagant and dangerous it is impossible prince for you to
read this letter

Then excuse my having offered said Djalma mildly

And yet resumed Rodin after a moments reflection and as if
speaking to himself why not

And he added addressing Djalma Would you really be so obliging my
dear prince I should not have ventured to ask you this service

So saying Rodin delivered the letter to Djalma who read aloud as
follows Your visit this morning to SaintDizier House can only be
considered from what I hear as a new act of aggression on your part

Here is the last proposition I have to make It may be as fruitless as
the step I took yesterday when I called upon you in the Rue Clovis

After that long and painful explanation I told you that I would write
to you I keep my promise and here is my ultimatum

First of all a piece of advice Beware If you are determined to
maintain so unequal a struggle you will be exposed even to the hatred
of those whom you so foolishly seek to protect There are a thousand
ways to ruin you with them by enlightening them as to your protects It
will be proved to them that you have shared in the plat which you
now pretend to reveal not from generosity but from cupidity Though
Djalma had the delicacy to feel that the least question on the subject
of this letter would be a serious indiscretion he could not forbear
turning his head suddenly towards the Jesuit as he read the last
passage

Oh yes it relates to me Such as you see me my dear prince added
he glancing at his shabby clothes I am accused of cupidity

And who are these people that you protect

Those I protect said Rodin feigning some hesitation as if he
had been embarrassed to find an answer who are those I protect
HemhemI will tell you They are poor devils without resources good
people without a penny having only a just cause on their side in a
lawsuit in which they are engaged They are threatened with destruction
by powerful partiesvery powerful parties but happily these latter
are known to me and I am able to unmask them What else could have
been Being myself poor and weak I range myself naturally on the side
of the poor and weak But continue I beg of you

Djalma resumed You have therefore everything to fear if you persist
in your hostility and nothing to gain by taking the side of those whom
you call your friends They might more justly be termed your dupes for
your disinterestedness would be inexplicable were it sincere It must
therefore conceal some afterthought of cupidity

Well in that view of the case we can offer you ample
compensationwith this difference that your hopes are now entirely
founded on the probable gratitude of your friends a very doubtful
chance at the best whereas our offers will be realized on the instant
To speak clearly this is what we ask what we exact of you This very
night before twelve you must have left Paris and engage not to return
for six months Djalma could not repress a movement of surprise and
looked at Rodin

Quite natural said the latter the cause of my poor friends would be
judged by that time and I should be unable to watch over them You see
how it is my dear prince added Rodin with bitter indignation But
please continue and excuse me for having interrupted you though
indeed such impudence disgusts me

Djalma continued That we may be certain of your removal from Paris
for six months you will go to the house of one of our friends in
Germany You will there be received with generous hospitality but
forcibly detained until the expiration of the term

Yes yes a voluntary prison said Rodin

On these conditions you will receive a pension of one thousand francs
a month to begin from your departure from Paris ten thousand francs
down and twenty thousand at the end of the six monthsthe whole to
be completely secured to you Finally at the end of the six months we
will place you in a position both honorable and independent

Djalma having stopped short with involuntary indignation Rodin said to
him Let me beg you to continue my dear prince Read to the end
and it will give you some idea of what passes in the midst of our
civilization

Djalma resumed You know well enough the course of affairs and what
we are to feel that in providing for your absence we only wish to get
rid of an enemy not very dangerous but rather troublesome Do not be
blinded by your first success The results of your denunciation will
be stifled because they are calumnious The judge who received your
evidence will soon repent his odious partiality You may make what use
you please of this letter We know what we write to whom we write and
how we write You will receive this letter at three oclock if by four
oclock we have not your full and complete acceptance written with your
own hand at the bottom of this letter war must commence between usand
not from tomorrow but on the instant

Having finished reading the letter Djalma looked at Rodin who said to
him Permit me to summon Faringhea

He rang the bell and the halfcaste appeared Rodin took the letter
from the hands of Djalma tore it into halves rubbed it between his
palms so as to make a sort of a ball and said to the halfcaste as
he returned it to him Give this palter to the person who waits for
it and tell him that is my only answer to his shameless and insolent
letter you understand methis shameless and insolent letter

I understand said the halfcaste and he went out

This will perhaps be a dangerous war for you father said the Indian
with interest

Yes dear prince it may be dangerous but I am not like you I have no
wish to kill my enemies because they are cowardly and wicked I fight
them under the shield of the law Imitate me in this Then seeing that
the countenance of Djalma darkened he added I am wrong I will advise
you no more on this subject Only let us defer the decision to the
judgment of your noble and motherly protectress I shall see her to
morrow if she consents I will tell you the names of your enemies If
notnot

And this woman this second mother said Djalma is her character
such that I can rely on her judgment

She cried Rodin clasping his hands and speaking with increased
excitement Why she is the most noble the most generous the most
valiant being upon earthwhy if you were really her son and she
loved you with all the strength of maternal affection and a case arose
in which you had to choose between an act of baseness and death she
would say to you Die though she might herself die with you

Oh noble woman so was my mother cried Djalma with enthusiasm

Yes resumed Rodin with growing energy as he approached the window
concealed by the shade towards which he threw an oblique and anxious
glance if you would imagine your protectress think only of courage
uprightness and loyalty personified Oh she has the chivalrous
frankness of the brave man joined with the highsouled dignity of the
woman who not only never in her life told a falsehood never concealed
a single thought but who would rather die than give way to the least
of those sentiments of craft and dissimulation which are almost forced
upon ordinary women by the situation in which they are placed

It is difficult to express the admiration which shone upon the
countenance of Djalma as he listened to this description His eyes
sparkled his cheeks glowed his heart palpitated with enthusiasm

That is well noble heart said Rodin to him drawing still nearer
to the blind I love to see your soul sparkle through your eyes on
hearing me speak thus of your unknown protectress Oh but she is worthy
of the pious adoration which noble hearts and great characters inspire

Oh I believe you cried Djalma with enthusiasm my heart is full of
admiration and also of astonishment for my mother is no more and yet
such a woman exists

Yes she exists For the consolation of the afflicted for the glory of
her sex she exists For the honor of truth and the shame of falsehood
she exists No lie no disguise has ever tainted her loyalty brilliant
and heroic as the sword of a knight It is but a few days ago that this
noble woman spoke to me these admirable words which in all my life
I shall not forget Sir she said if ever I suspect any one that I
love or esteem

Rodin did not finish The shade so violently shaken that the spring
broke was drawn up abruptly and to the great astonishment of Djalma
Mdlle de Cardoville appeared before him Adriennes cloak had fallen
from her shoulders and in the violence of the movement with which she
had approached the blind her bonnet the strings of which were untied
had also fallen Having left home suddenly with only just time to throw
a mantle over the picturesque and charming costume which she often chose
to wear when alone she appeared so radiant with beauty to Djalmas
dazzled eyes in the centre of those leaves and flowers that the Indian
believed himself under the influence of a dream

With clasped hands eyes wide open the body slightly bent forward as
if in the act of prayer he stood petrified with admiration Mdlle de
Cardoville much agitated and her countenance glowing with emotion
remained on the threshold of the greenhouse without entering the room
All this had passed in less time than it takes to describe it Hardly
had the blind been raised than Rodin feigning surprise exclaimed
You here madame

Oh sir said Adrienne in an agitated voice I come to terminate
the phrase which you have commenced I told you that when a suspicion
crossed my mind I uttered it aloud to the person by whom it was
inspired Well I confess it I have failed in this honesty I came here
as a spy upon you when your answer to the Abbe dAigrigny was giving me
a new pledge of your devotion and sincerity I doubted your uprightness
at the moment when you were bearing testimony to my frankness For
the first time in my life I stooped to deceit this weakness merits
punishment and I submit to itdemands reparation and I make itcalls
for apologies and I tender them to you Then turning towards Djalma
she added Now prince I am no longer mistress of my secret I am your
relation Mdlle de Cardoville and I hope you will accept from a sister
the hospitality that you did not refuse from a mother

Djalma made no reply Plunged in ecstatic contemplation of this sudden
apparition which surpassed his wildest and most dazzling visions he
felt a sort of intoxication which paralyzing the power of thought
concentrated all his faculties in the one sense of sight and just as we
sometimes seek in vain to satisfy unquenchable thirst the burning look
of the Indian sought as it were with devouring avidity to take in
all the rare perfections of the young lady Verily never had two more
divine types of beauty met face to face Adrienne and Djalma were the
very ideal of a handsome youth and maiden There seemed to be something
providential in the meeting of these two natures so young and so
vivacious so generous and so full of passion so heroic and so proud
who before coming into contact had singularly enough each learned
the moral worth of the other for if at the words of Rodin Djalma had
felt arise in his heart an admiration as lively as it was sudden for
the valiant and generous qualities of that unknown benefactress whom
he now discovered in Mdlle de Cardoville the latter had in her turn
been moved affected almost terrified by the interview she had just
overheard in which Djalma had displayed the nobleness of his soul
the delicate goodness of his heart and the terrible transports of
his temper Then she had not been able to repress a movement of
astonishment almost admiration at sight of the surprising beauty of
the prince and soon after a strange painful sentiment a sort
of electric shock seemed to penetrate all her being as her eyes
encountered Djalmas

Cruelly agitated and suffering deeply from this agitation she tried
to dissemble the impression she had received by addressing Rodin to
apologize for having suspected him But the obstinate silence of the
Indian redoubled the ladys painful embarrassment Again raising her
eyes towards the prince to invite him to respond to her fraternal
offer she met his ardent gaze wildly fixed upon her and she looked
once more with a mixture of fear sadness and wounded pride then she
congratulated herself on having foreseen the inexorable necessity of
keeping Djalma at a distance from her such apprehension did this ardent
and impetuous nature already inspire Wishing to put an end to her
present painful situation she said to Rodin in a low and trembling
voice Pray sir speak to the prince repeat to him my offers I
cannot remain longer So saying Adrienne turned as if to rejoin
Florine But at the first step Djalma sprang towards her with the
bound of a tiger about to be deprived of his prey Terrified by the
expression of wild excitement which inflamed the Indians countenance
the young lady drew back with a loud scream

At this Djalma remembered himself and all that had passed Pale with
regret and shame trembling dismayed his eyes streaming with tears
and all his features marked with an expression of the most touching
despair he fell at Adriennes feet and lifting his clasped hands
towards her said in a soft supplicating timid voice Oh remain
remain do not leave me I have waited for you so long To this prayer
uttered with the timid simplicity of a child and a resignation which
contrasted strangely with the savage violence that had so frightened
Adrienne she replied as she made a sign to Florine to prepare for
their departure Prince it is impossible for me to remain longer
here

But you will return said Djalma striving to restrain his tears I
shall see you again

Oh no nevernever said Mdlle de Cardoville in a failing voice
Then profiting by the stupor into which her answer had thrown Djalma
Adrienne disappeared rapidly behind the plants in the greenhouse

Florine was hastening to rejoin her mistress when just at the
moment she passed before Rodin he said to her in a low quick voice
Tomorrow we must finish with the hunchback Florine trembled in every
limb and without answering Rodin disappeared like her mistress
behind the plants Broken overpowered Djalma remained upon his knees
with his head resting on his breast His countenance expressed neither
rage nor excitement but a painful stupor he wept silently Seeing
Rodin approach him he rose but with so tremulous a step that he could
hardly reach the divan on which he sank down hiding his face in his
hands

Then Rodin advancing said to him in a mild and insinuating tone
Alas I feared what has happened I did not wish you to see your
benefactress and if I told you she was old do you know why dear
prince

Djalma without answering let his hands fall upon his knees and turned
towards Rodin a countenance still bathed in tears

I knew that Mdlle de Cardoville was charming and at your age it is
so easy to fall in love continued Rodin I wished to spare you that
misfortune my dear prince for your beautiful protectress passionately
loves a handsome young man of this town

Upon these words Djalma suddenly pressed both hands to his heart as if
he felt a piercing stab uttered a cry of savage grief threw back his
head and fell fainting upon the divan

Rodin looked at him coldly for some seconds and then said as he went
away brushing his old hat with his elbow

Come it worksit works




CHAPTER XLV THE CONSULTATION

It is night It has just struck nine It is the evening of that day
on which Mdlle de Cardoville first found herself in the presence of
Djalma Florine pale agitated trembling with a candle in her hand
had just entered a bedroom plainly but comfortably furnished This room
was one of the apartments occupied by Mother Bunch in Adriennes house
They were situated on the groundfloor and had two entrances One
opened on the garden and the other on the courtyard From this side
came the persons who applied to the workgirl for succor an antechamber
in which they waited a parlor in which they were received constituted
Mother Bunchs apartments along with the bedroom which Florine
had just entered looking about her with an anxious and alarmed air
scarcely touching the carpet with the tips of her satin shoes holding
her breath and listening at the least noise

Placing the candle upon the chimneypiece she took a rapid survey
of the chamber and approached the mahogany desk surmounted by a
wellfilled bookcase The key had been left in the drawers of this
piece of furniture and they were all three examined by Florine They
contained different petitions from persons in distress and various
notes in the girls handwriting This was not what Florine wanted Three
cardboard boxes were placed in pigeonholes beneath the bookcase These
also were vainly explored and Florine with a gesture of vexation
looked and listened anxiously then seeing a chest of drawers she
made therein a fresh and useless search Near the foot of the bed was
a little door leading to a dressingroom Florine entered it and
lookedat first without successinto a large wardrobe in which were
suspended several black dresses recently made for Mother Bunch
by order of Mdlle de Cardoville Perceiving at the bottom of this
wardrobe half hidden beneath a cloak a very shabby little trunk
Florine opened it hastily and found there carefully folded up the
poor old garments in which the workgirl had been clad when she first
entered this opulent mansion

Florine startedan involuntary emotion contracted her features but
considering that she had not liberty to indulge her feelings but only
to obey Rodins implacable orders she hastily closed both trunk and
wardrobe and leaving the dressingroom returned into the bedchamber
After having again examined the writingstand a sudden idea occurred to
her Not content with once more searching the cardboard boxes she drew
out one of them from the pigeonhole hoping to find what she sought
behind the box her first attempt failed but the second was more
successful She found behind the middle box a copybook of considerable
thickness She started in surprise for she had expected something else
yet she took the manuscript opened it and rapidly turned over
the leaves After having perused several pages she manifested her
satisfaction and seemed as if about to put the book in her pocket but
after a moments reflection she replaced it where she had found it
arranged everything in order took her candle and quitted the apartment
without being discoveredof which indeed she had felt pretty sure
knowing that Mother Bunch would be occupied with Mdlle de Cardoville
for some hours

The day after Florines researches Mother Bunch alone in her bed
chamber was seated in an armchair close to a good fire A thick
carpet covered the floor through the windowcurtains could be seen the
lawn of a large garden the deep silence was only interrupted by the
regular ticking of a clock and the crackling of the wood Her
hands resting on the arms of the chair she gave way to a feeling of
happiness such as she had never so completely enjoyed since she took
up her residence at the hotel For her accustomed so long to cruel
privations there was a kind of inexpressible charm in the calm silence
of this retreatin the cheerful aspect of the garden and above all in
the consciousness that she was indebted for this comfortable position
to the resignation and energy she had displayed in the thick of the
many severe trials which now ended so happily An old woman with a mild
and friendly countenance who had been by express desire of Adrienne
attached to the hunchbacks service entered the room and said to her
Mademoiselle a young man wishes to speak to you on pressing business
He gives his name as Agricola Baudoin

At this name Mother Bunch uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy
blushed slightly rose and ran to the door which led to the parlor in
which was Agricola

Goodmorning dear sister said the smith cordially embracing the
young girl whose cheeks burned crimson beneath those fraternal kisses

Ah me cried the sempstress on a sudden as she looked anxiously
at Agricola what is that black band on your forehead You have been
wounded

A mere nothing said the smith really nothing Do not think of it
I will tell you all about that presently But first I have things of
importance to communicate

Come into my room then we shall be alone Mother Bunch as she went
before Agricola

Notwithstanding the expression of uneasiness which was visible on the
countenance of Agricola he could not forbear smiling with pleasure as
he entered the room and looked around him

Excellent my poor sister this is how I would always have you lodged
I recognize here the hand of Mdlle de Cardoville What a heart what
a noble mindDost know she wrote to me the day before yesterday
to thank me for what I had done for her and sent me a gold pin very
plain which she said I need not hesitate to accept as it had no other
value but that of having been worn by her mother You cant tell how
much I was affected by the delicacy of this gift

Nothing must astonish you from a heart like hers answered the
hunchback But the woundthe wound

Presently my good sister I have so many things to tell you Let us
begin by what is most pressing for I want you to give me some good
advice in a very serious case You know how much confidence I have in
your excellent heart and judgment And then I have to ask of you a
serviceoh a great service added the smith in an earnest and
almost solemn tone which astonished his hearer Let us begin with what
is not personal to myself

Speak quickly

Since my mother went with Gabriel to the little country curacy he has
obtained and since my father lodges with Marshal Simon and the young
ladies I have resided you know with my mates at M Hardys factory
in the common dwellinghouse Now this morning but first I must tell
you that M Hardy who has lately returned from a journey is again
absent for a few days on business This morning then at the hour of
breakfast I remained at work a little after the last stroke of the
bell I was leaving the workshop to go to our eatingroom when I saw
entering the courtyard a lady who had just got out of a hackneycoach
I remarked that she was fair though her veil was half down she had
a mild and pretty countenance and her dress was that of a fashionable
lady Struck with her paleness and her anxious frightened air I asked
her if she wanted anything Sir said she to me in a trembling voice
and as if with a great effort do you belong to this factoryYes
madameM Hardy is then in clanger she exclaimedM Hardy
madame He has not yet returned homeWhat she went on M Hardy
did not come hither yesterday evening Was he not dangerously wounded by
some of the machinery As she said these words the poor young ladys
lips trembled and I saw large tears standing in her eyes Thank God
madame all this is entirely false said I for M Hardy has
not returned and indeed is only expected by tomorrow or the day
afterYou are quite sure that he has not returned quite sure that
he is not hurt resumed the pretty young lady drying her eyesQuite
sure madame if M Hardy were in danger I should not be so quiet in
talking to you about himOh thank God thank God cried the young
lady Then she expressed to me her gratitude with so happy so feeling
an air that I was quite touched by it But suddenly as if then only
she felt ashamed of the step she had taken she let down her veil left
me precipitately went out of the courtyard and got once more into the
hackneycoach that had brought her I said to myself This is a lady
who takes great interest in M Hardy and has been alarmed by a false
report

She loves him doubtless said Mother Bunch much moved and in
her anxiety she perhaps committed an act of imprudence in coming to
inquire after him

It is only too true I saw her get into the coach with interests for
her emotion had infected me The coach startedand what did I see a few
seconds after A cab which the young lady could not have perceived for
it had been hidden by an angle of the wall and as it turned round the
corner I distinguished perfectly a man seated by the drivers side and
making signs to him to take the same road as the hackneycoach

The poor young lady was followed said Mother Bunch anxiously

No doubt of it so I instantly hastened after the coach reached it
and through the blinds that were let down I said to the young lady
whilst I kept running by the side of the coach door Take care madame
you are followed by a cab

Well Agricola and what did she answer

I heard her exclaim Great Heaven with an accent of despair The
coach continued its course The cab soon came up with me I saw by
the side of the driver a great fat ruddy man who having watched me
running after the coach no doubt suspected something for he looked at
me somewhat uneasily

And when does M Hardy return asked the hunchback

Tomorrow or the day after Now my good sister advise me It is
evident that this young lady loves M Hardy She is probably married
for she looked so embarrassed when she spoke to me and she uttered
a cry of terror on learning that she was followed What shall I do I
wished to ask advice of Father Simon but he is so very strict in such
mattersand then a love affair at his agewhile you are so delicate
and sensible my good sister that you will understand it all

The girl started and smiled bitterly Agricola did not perceive it and
thus continued So I said to myself There is only Mother Bunch who
can give me good advice Suppose M Hardy returns tomorrow shall I
tell him what has passed or not

Wait a moment cried the other suddenly interrupting Agricola and
appearing to recollect something when I went to St Marys Convent to
ask for work of the superior she proposed that I should be employed by
the day in a house in which I was to watch or in other words to act
as a spy

What a wretch

And do you know said the girl with whom I was to begin this odious
trade Why with a Madame deFremont or de Bremont I do not remember
which a very religious woman whose daughter a young married lady
received visits a great deal too frequent according to the superior
from a certain manufacturer

What do you say cried Agricola This manufacturer must be

M Hardy I had too many reasons to remember that name when it was
pronounced by the superior Since that day so many other events have
taken place that I had almost forgotten the circumstance But it is
probable that this young lady is the one of whom I heard speak at the
convent

And what interest had the superior of the convent to set a spy upon
her asked the smith

I do not know but it is clear that the same interest still exists
since the young lady was followed and perhaps at this hour is
discovered and dishonored Oh it is dreadful Then seeing Agricola
start suddenly Mother Bunch added What then is the matter

Yeswhy not said the smith speaking to himself why may not all
this be the work of the same hand The superior of a convent may have a
private understanding with an abbebut then for what end

Explain yourself Agricola said the girl And thenwhere did you
get your wound Tell me that I conjure you

It is of my wound that I am just going to speak for in truth the
more I think of it the more this adventure of the young lady seems to
connect itself with other facts

How so

You must know that for the last few days singular things are passing
in the neighborhood of our factory First as we are in Lent an abbe
from Paris a tall finelooking man they say has come to preach in
the little village of Villiers which is only a quarter of a league from
our works The abbe has found occasion to slander and attack M Hardy in
his sermons

How is that

M Hardy has printed certain rules with regard to our work and the
rights and benefits he grants us These rules are followed by various
maxims as noble as they are simple with precepts of brotherly love such
as all the world can understand extracted from different philosophies
and different religions But because M Hardy has chosen what is best in
all religions the abbe concludes that M Hardy has no religion at all
and he has therefore not only attacked him for this in the pulpit
but has denounced our factory as a centre of perdition and damnable
corruption because on Sundays instead of going to listen to his
sermons or to drink at a tavern our comrades with their wives and
children pass their time in cultivating their little gardens in
reading singing in chorus or dancing together in the common dwelling
house The abbe has even gone so far as to say that the neighborhood
of such an assemblage of atheists as he calls us might draw down the
anger of Heaven upon the countrythat the hovering of Cholera was much
talked of and that very possibly thanks to our impious presence the
plague might fall upon all our neighborhood

But to tell such things to ignorant people exclaimed Mother Bunch
is likely to excite them to fatal actions

That is just what the abbe wants

What do you tell me

The people of the environs still more excited no doubt by other
agitators show themselves hostile to the workmen of our factory Their
hatred or at least their envy has been turned to account Seeing
us live all together well lodged well warmed and comfortably clad
active gay and laborious their jealousy has been embittered by the
sermons and by the secret manoeuvres of some depraved characters
who are known to be bad workmen in the employment of M Tripeaud our
opposition All this excitement is beginning to bear fruit there have
been already two or three fights between us and our neighbors It was in
one of these skirmishes that I received a blow with a stone on my head

Is it not serious Agricolaare you quite sure said Mother Bunch
anxiously

It is nothing at all I tell you But the enemies of M Hardy have not
confined themselves to preaching They have brought into play something
far more dangerous

What is that

I and nearly all my comrades did our part in the three Revolutionary
days of July but we are not eager at present for good reasons to take
up arms again That is not everybodys opinion well we do not blame
others but we have our own ideas and Father Simon who is as brave as
his son and as good a patriot as any one approves and directs us Now
for some days past we find all about the factory in the garden in the
courts printed papers to this effect You are selfish cowards because
chance has given you a good master you remain indifferent to the
misfortunes of your brothers and to the means of freeing them material
comforts have enervated your hearts

Dear me Agricola what frightful perseverance in wickedness

Yes and unfortunately these devices have their effect on some of
our younger mates As the appeal was after all to proud and generous
sentiments it has had some influence Already seeds of division have
shown themselves in our workshops where before all were united as
brothers A secret agitation now reigns there Cold suspicion takes the
place with some of our accustomed cordiality Now if I tell you that
I am nearly sure these printed papers thrown over the walls of our
factory to raise these little sparks of discord amongst us have been
scattered about by the emissaries of this same preaching abbewould
it not seem from all this taken in conjunction with what happened this
morning to the young lady that M Hardy has of late numerous enemies

Like you I think it very fearful Agricola said the girl and it
is so serious that M Hardy alone can take a proper decision on the
subject As for what happened this morning to the young lady it appears
to me that immediately on M Hardys return you should ask for an
interview with him and however delicate such a communication may be
tell him all that passed

There is the difficulty Shall I not seem as if wishing to pry into his
secrets

If the young lady had not been followed I should have shared your
scruples But she was watched and is evidently in danger It is
therefore in my opinion your duty to warn M Hardy Suppose which is
not improbable that the lady is married would it not be better for a
thousand reasons that M Hardy should know all

You are right my good sister I will follow your advice M Hardy
shall know everything But now that we have spoken of others I have to
speak of myselfyes of myselffor it concerns a matter on which may
depend the happiness of my whole life added the smith in a tone of
seriousness which struck his hearer You know proceeded Agricola
after a moments silence that from my childhood I have never
concealed anything from youthat I have told you everythingabsolutely
everything

I know it Agricola I know it said the hunchback stretching out her
white and slender hand to the smith who grasped it cordially and thus
continued When I say everything I am not quite exactfor I have
always concealed from you my little loveaffairsbecause though we may
tell almost anything to a sister there are subjects of which we ought
not to speak to a good and virtuous girl such as you are

I thank you Agricola I had remarked this reserve on your part
observed the other casting down her eyes and heroically repressing the
grief she felt I thank you

But for the very reason that I made it a duty never to speak to you
of such love affairs I said to myself if ever it should happen that I
have a serious passionsuch a love as makes one think of marriageoh
then just as we tell our sister even before our father and mother my
good sister shall be the first to be informed of it

You are very kind Agricola

Well then the serious passion has come at last I am over head and
ears in love and I think of marriage

At these words of Agricola poor Mother Bunch felt herself for an
instant paralyzed It seemed as if all her blood was suddenly frozen in
her veins For some seconds she thought she was going to die Her heart
ceased to beat she felt it not breaking but melting away to nothing
Then the first blasting emotion over like those martyrs who found in
the very excitement of pain the terrible power to smile in the midst
of tortures the unfortunate girl found in the fear of betraying the
secret of her fatal and ridiculous love almost incredible energy She
raised her head looked at the smith calmly almost serenely and said
to him in a firm voice Ah so you truly love

That is to say my good sister that for the last four days I
scarcely live at allor live only upon this passion

It is only since four days that you have been in love

Not morebut time has nothing to do with it

And is she very pretty

Dark hairthe figure of a nymphfair as a lilyblue eyes as large
as thatand as mild as good as your own

You flatter me Agricola

No no it is Angela that I flatterfor thats her name What a pretty
one Is it not my good Mother Bunch

A charming name said the poor girl contrasting bitterly that
graceful appellation with her own nickname which the thoughtless
Agricola applied to her without thinking of it Then she resumed with
fearful calmness Angela yes it is a charming name

Well then imagine to yourself that this name is not only suited to
her face but to her heart In a word I believe her heart to be almost
equal to yours

She has my eyesshe has my heart said Mother Bunch smiling It is
singular how like we are

Agricola did not perceive the irony of despair contained in these words
He resumed with a tenderness as sincere as it was inexorable Do you
think my good girl that I could ever have fallen seriously in love
with any one who had not in character heart and mind much of you

Come brother said the girl smilingyes the unfortunate creature
had the strength to smile come brother you are in a gallant vein
to day Where did you make the acquaintance of this beautiful young
person

She is only the sister of one of my mates Her mother is the head
laundress in our common dwelling and as she was in want of assistance
and we always take in preference the relations of members of the
association Mrs Bertin thats the mothers name sent for her
daughter from Lille where she had been stopping with one of her aunts
and for the last five days she has been in the laundry The first
evening I saw her I passed three hours after work was over in talking
with her and her mother and brother and the next day I felt that my
heart was gone the day after that the feeling was only strongerand
now I am quite mad about her and resolved on marriageaccording as you
shall decide Do not be surprised at this everything depends upon you
I shall only ask my father and mothers leave after I have yours

I do not understand you Agricola

You know the utter confidence I have in the incredible instinct of your
heart Many times you have said to me Agricola love this person
love that person have confidence in that otherand never yet were you
deceived Well you must now render me the same service You will ask
permission of Mdlle de Cardoville to absent yourself I will take you
to the factory I have spoken of you to Mrs Benin and her daughter
as of a beloved sister and according to your impression at sight
of Angela I will declare myself or not This may be childishness or
superstition on my part but I am so made

Be it so answered Mother Bunch with heroic courage I will see
Mdlle Angela I will tell you what I think of herand that mind you
sincerely

I know it When will you come

I must ask Mdlle de Cardoville what day she can spare sue I will let
you know

Thanks my good sister said Agricola warmly then he added with a
smile Bring your best judgment with youyour full dress judgment

Do not make a jest of it brother said Mother Bunch in a mild sad
voice it is a serious matter for it concerns the happiness of your
whole life

At this moment a modest knock was heard at the door Come in said
Mother Bunch Florine appeared

My mistress begs that you will come to her if you are not engaged
said Florine to Mother Bunch

The latter rose and addressing the smith said to him Please wait a
moment Agricola I will ask Mdlle de Cardoville what day I can dispose
of and I will come and tell you So saying the girl went out leaving
Agricola with Florine

I should have much wished to pay my respects to Mdlle de Cardoville
said Agricola but I feared to intrude

My lady is not quite well sir said Florine and receives no one to
day I am sure that as soon as she is better she will be quite pleased
to see you

Here Mother Bunch returned and said to Agricola If you can come for
me tomorrow about three oclock so as not to lose the whole day we
will go to the factory and you can bring me back in the evening

Then at three oclock tomorrow my good sister

At three tomorrow Agricola

The evening of that same day when all was quiet in the hotel Mother
Bunch who had remained till ten oclock with Mdlle de Cardoville re
entered her bedchamber locked the door after her and finding herself
at length free and unrestrained threw herself on her knees before a
chair and burst into tears She wept longvery long When her tears at
length ceased to flow she dried her eyes approached the writingdesk
drew out one of the boxes from the pigeonhole and taking from this
hidingplace the manuscript which Florine had so rapidly glanced over
the evening before she wrote in it during a portion of the night




CHAPTER XLVI MOTHER BUNCHS DIARY

We have said that the hunchback wrote during a portion of the night
in the book discovered the previous evening by Florine who had not
ventured to take it away until she had informed the persons who
employed her of its contents and until she had received their final
orders on the subject Let us explain the existence of this manuscript
before opening it to the reader The day on which Mother Bunch first
became aware of her love for Agricola the first word of this manuscript
had been written Endowed with an essentially trusting character yet
always feeling herself restrained by the dread of ridiculea dread
which in its painful exaggeration was the workgirls only weaknessto
whom could the unfortunate creature have confided the secret of that
fatal passion if not to paperthat mute confidant of timid and
suffering souls that patient friend silent and cold who if it makes
no reply to heart rending complaints at least always listens and never
forgets

When her heart was overflowing with emotion sometimes mild and sad
sometimes harsh and bitter the poor workgirl finding a melancholy
charm in these dumb and solitary outpourings of the soul now clothed in
the form of simple and touching poetry and now in unaffected prose
had accustomed herself by degrees not to confine her confidences to what
immediately related to Agricola for though he might be mixed up with
all her thoughts for reflections which the sight of beauty of happy
love of maternity of wealth of misfortune called up within her were
so impressed with the influence of her unfortunate personal position
that she would not even have dared to communicate them to him Such
then was this journal of a poor daughter of the people weak deformed
and miserable but endowed with an angelic soul and a fine intellect
improved by reading meditation and solitude pages quite unknown
which yet contained many deep and striking views both as regard men and
things taken from the peculiar standpoint in which fate had placed
this unfortunate creature The following lines here and there abruptly
interrupted or stained with tears according to the current of her
various emotions on hearing of Agricolas deep love for Angela formed
the last pages of this journal

Friday March 3d 1832

I spent the night without any painful dreams This morning I rose with
no sorrowful presentiment I was calm and tranquil when Agricola came
He did not appear to me agitated He was simple and affectionate as
he always is He spoke to me of events relating to M Hardy and then
without transition without hesitation he said to me The last four
days I have been desperately in love The sentiment is so serious that
I think of marriage I have come to consult you about it That was how
this overwhelming revelation was made to menaturally and cordiallyI
on one side of the hearth and Agricola an the other as if we had
talked of indifferent things And yet no more is needed to break
ones heart Some one enters embraces you like a brother sits down
talksand thenOh Merciful heaven my head wanders

I feel calmer now Courage my poor heart courageShould a day of
misfortune again overwhelm me I will read these lines written under the
impression of the most cruel grief I can ever feel and I will say to
myself What is the present woe compared to that past My grief is
indeed cruel it is illegitimate ridiculous shameful I should not
dare to confess it even to the most indulgent of mothers Alas
there are some fearful sorrows which yet rightly make men shrug their
shoulders in pity or contempt Alas these are forbidden misfortunes
Agricola has asked me to go tomorrow to see this young girl to whom he
is so passionately attached and whom he will marry if the instinct of
my heart should approve the marriage This thought is the most painful
of all those which have tortured me since he so pitilessly announced
this love Pitilessly No Agricolano my brotherforgive me this
unjust cry of pain Is it that you know can even suspect that I love
you better than you love better than you can ever love this charming
creature

Darkhairedthe figure of a nymphfair as a lilywith blue eyesas
large as thatand almost as mild as your own

That is the portrait he drew of her Poor Agricola how would he have
suffered had he known that every one of his words was tearing my heart
Never did I so strongly feel the deep commiseration and tender pity
inspired by a good affectionate being who in the sincerity of his
ignorance gives you your deathwound with a smile We do not blame
himnowe pity him to the full extent of the grief that he would feel
on learning the pain he had caused me It is strange but never did
Agricola appear to me more handsome than this morning His manly
countenance was slightly agitated as he spoke of the uneasiness of that
pretty young lady As I listened to him describing the agony of a woman
who runs the risk of ruin for the man she loves I felt my heart
beat violently my hands were burning a soft languor floated over
meRidiculous folly As if I had any right to feel thus

I remember that while he spoke I cast a rapid glance at the glass I
felt proud that I was so well dressed he had not even remarked it but
no matterit seemed to me that my cap became me that my hair shone
finely my gaze beamed mildI found Agricola so handsome that I almost
began to think myself less uglyno doubt to excuse myself in my own
eyes for daring to love him After all what happened today would have
happened one day or another Yes that is consolinglike the thoughts
that death is nothing because it must come at lastto those who are
in love with life I have been always preserved from suicidethe last
resource of the unfortunate who prefer trusting in God to remaining
amongst his creaturesby the sense of duty One must not only think
of self And I reflected alsoGod is goodalways goodsince the most
wretched beings find opportunities for love and devotion How is it
that I so weak and poor have always found means to be helpful and
useful to some one

This very day I felt tempted to make an end with lifeAgricola and
his mother had no longer need of meYes but the unfortunate creatures
whom Mdlle de Cardoville has commissioned me to watch overbut my
benefactress herself though she has affectionately reproached me with
the tenacity of my suspicions in regard to that man I am more than ever
alarmed for herI feel that she is more than ever in dangermore than
everI have faith in the value of my presence near her Hence I must
live Liveto go tomorrow to see this girl whom Agricola passionately
loves Good heaven why have I always known grief and never hate There
must be a bitter pleasure in hating So many people hatePerhaps I
may hate this girlAngela as he called her when he said with so much
simplicity A charming name is it not Mother Bunch Compare this
name which recalls an idea so full of grace with the ironical symbol
of my witchs deformity Poor Agricola poor brother goodness
is sometimes as blind as malice I see Should I hate this young
girlWhy Did she deprive me of the beauty which charms Agricola Can
I find fault with her for being beautiful When I was not yet accustomed
to the consequences of my ugliness I asked myself with bitter
curiosity why the Creator had endowed his creatures so unequally The
habit of pain has allowed me to reflect calmly and I have finished by
persuading myself that to beauty and ugliness are attached the two most
noble emotions of the souladmiration and compassion Those who are
like me admire beautiful personssuch as Angela such as Agricolaand
these in their turn feel a couching pity for such as I am Sometimes in
spite of ones self one has very foolish hopes Because Agricola from
a feeling of propriety had never spoken to me of his love affairs I
sometimes persuaded myself that he had nonethat he loved me and that
the fear of ridicule alone was with him as with me an obstacle in the
way of confessing it Yes I have even made verses on that subjectand
those I think not the worst I have written

Mine is a singular position If I love I am ridiculous if any love
me he is still more ridiculous How did I come so to forget that as to
have suffered and to suffer what I doBut blessed be that suffering
since it has not engendered hateno for I will not hate this girlI
will Perform a sisters part to the last I will follow the guidance of
my heart I have the instinct of preserving othersmy heart will lead
and enlighten me My only fear is that I shall burst into tears when
I see her and not be able to conquer my emotion Oh then what
a revelation to Agricolaa discovery of the mad love he has
inspiredOh never the day in which he knew that would be the last of
my life There would then be within me something stronger than dutythe
longing to escape from shamethat incurable shame that burns me like a
hot iron No no I will be calm Besides did I not just now when
with him bear courageously a terrible trial I will be calm My personal
feelings must not darken the second sight so clear for those I love
Oh painfulpainful task for the fear of yielding involuntarily to
evil sentiments must not render me too indulgent toward this girl I
might compromise Agricolas happiness since my decision is to guide his
choice Poor creature that I am How I deceive myself Agricola asks my
advice because he thinks that I shall have not the melancholy courage
to oppose his passion or else he would say to me No matterI love
and I brave the future

But then if my advice if the instincts of my heart are not to guide
himif his resolution is taken beforehandof what use will be
to morrows painful mission Of what use To obey him Did he not
sayCome In thinking of my devotion for him how many times in the
secret depths of my heart I have asked myself if the thought had ever
occurred to him to love me otherwise than as a sister if it had ever
struck him what a devoted wife he would have in me And why should
it have occurred to him As long as he wished as long as he may still
wish I have been and I shall be as devoted to him as if I were his
wife sister or mother Why should he desire what he already possesses

Married to himoh Godthe dream is mad as ineffable Are not such
thoughts of celestial sweetnesswhich include all sentiments from
sisterly to maternal loveforbidden to me on pain of ridicule as
distressing as if I wore dresses and ornaments that my ugliness and
deformity would render absurd I wonder if I were now plunged into the
most cruel distress whether I should suffer as much as I do on hearing
of Agricolas intended marriage Would hunger cold or misery diminish
this dreadful doloror is it the dread pain that would make me forget
hunger cold and misery

No no this irony is bitter It is not well in me to speak thus Why
such deep grief In what way have the affection the esteem the respect
of Agricola changed towards me I complainbut how would it be kind
heaven if as alas too often happens I were beautiful loving
devoted and he had chosen another less beautiful less loving less
devotedShould I not be a thousand times more unhappy for then I
might I would have to blame himwhilst now I can find no fault with
him for never having thought of a union which was impossible because
ridiculous And had he wished it could I ever have had the selfishness
to consent to it I began to write the first pages of this diary as I
began these last with my heart steeped in bitternessand as I went on
committing to paper what I could have intrusted to no one my soul grew
calm till resignation cameResignation my chosen saint who smiling
through her tears suffers and loves but hopesnever

These words were the last in the journal It was clear from the blots
of abundant tears that the unfortunate creature had often paused to
weep

In truth worn out by so many emotions Mother Bunch late in the night
had replaced the book behind the cardboard box not that she thought it
safer there than elsewhere she had no suspicion of the slightest need
for such precaution but because it was more out of the way there than
in any of the drawers which she frequently opened in presence of other
people Determined to perform her courageous promise and worthily
accomplish her task to the end she waited the next day for Agricola
and firm in her heroic resolution went with the smith to M Hardys
factory Florine informed of her departure but detained a portion
of the day in attendance on Mdlle de Cardoville preferred waiting for
night to perform the new orders she had asked and received since she
had communicated by letter the contents of Mother Bunchs journal
Certain not to be surprised she entered the workgirls chamber as soon
as the night was come

Knowing the place where she should find the manuscript she went
straight to the desk took out the box and then drawing from her
pocket a sealed letter prepared to leave it in the place of the
manuscript which she was to carry away with her So doing she trembled
so much that she was obliged to support herself an instant by the
table Every good sentiment was not extinct in Florines heart she
obeyed passively the orders she received but she felt painfully
how horrible and infamous was her conduct If only herself had been
concerned she would no doubt have had the courage to risk all rather
than submit to this odious despotism but unfortunately it was not so
and her ruin would have caused the mortal despair of another person whom
she loved better than life itself She resigned herself therefore not
without cruel anguish to abominable treachery

Though she hardly ever knew for what end she acted and this was
particularly the case with regard to the abstraction of the journal
she foresaw vaguely that the substitution of this sealed letter for
the manuscript would have fatal consequences for Mother Bunch for she
remembered Rodins declaration that it was time to finish with the
young sempstress

What did he mean by those words How would the letter that she was
charged to put in the place of the diary contribute to bring about
this result she did not knowbut she understood that the clearsighted
devotion of the hunchback justly alarmed the enemies of Mdlle de
Cardoville and that she Florine herself daily risked having her
perfidy detected by the young needlewoman This last fear put an end to
the hesitations of Florine she placed the letter behind the box and
hiding the manuscript under her apron cautiously withdrew from the
chamber




CHAPTER XLVII THE DIARY CONTINUED

Returned into her own room some hours after she had concealed there the
manuscript abstracted from Mother Bunchs apartment Florine yielded
to her curiosity and determined to look through it She soon felt a
growing interest an involuntary emotion as she read more of these
private thoughts of the young sempstress Among many pieces of verse
which all breathed a passionate love for Agricolaa love so deep
simple and sincere that Florine was touched by it and forgot the
authors deformityamong many pieces of verse we say were divers
other fragments thoughts and narratives relating to a variety of
facts We shall quote some of them in order to explain the profound
impression that their perusal made upon Florine

Fragments from the Diary

This is my birthday Until this evening I had cherished a foolish
hope Yesterday I went down to Mrs Baudoins to dress a little wound
she had on her leg When I entered the room Agricola was there No
doubt he was talking of me to his mother for they stopped when I came
in and exchanged a meaning smile In passing by the drawers I saw a
pasteboard box with a pincushionlid and I felt myself blushing
with joy as I thought this little present was destined for me but
I pretended not to see it While I was on my knees before his mother
Agricola went out I remarked that he took the little box with him
Never has Mrs Baudoin been more tender and motherly than she was that
morning It appeared to me that she went to bed earlier than usual
It is to send me away sooner said I to myself that I may enjoy
the surprise Agricola has prepared for me How my heart beat as I ran
fast very fast up to my closet I stopped a moment before opening the
door that my happiness might last the longer At last I entered the
room my eyes swimming with tears of joy I looked upon my table my
chair my bedthere was nothing The little box was not to be found My
heart sank within me Then I said to myself It will be tomorrowthis
is only the eve of my birthday The day is gone Evening is come
Nothing The pretty box was not for me It had a pincushioncover It
was only suited for a woman To whom has Agricola given it

I suffer a good deal just now It was a childish idea that I connected
with Agricolas wishing me many happy returns of the day I am ashamed
to confess it but it might have proved to me that he has not forgotten
I have another name besides that of Mother Bunch which they always
apply to me My susceptibility on this head is unfortunately so
stubborn that I cannot help feeling a momentary pang of mingled shame
and sorrow every time that I am called by that fairytale name and
yet I have had no other from infancy It is for that very reason that I
should have been so happy if Agricola had taken this opportunity to call
me for once by my own humble nameMagdalen Happily he will never know
these wishes and regrets

Deeper and deeper touched by this page of simple grief Florine turned
over several leaves and continued

I have just been to the funeral of poor little Victorine Herbin our
neighbor Her father a journeyman upholsterer is gone to work by the
month far from Paris She died at nineteen without a relation near
her Her agony was not long The good woman who attended her to the
last told us that she only pronounced these words At last oh at
last and that with an air of satisfaction added the nurse Dear
child she had become so pitiful At fifteen she was a rosebudso
pretty so freshlooking with her light hair as soft as silk but she
wasted away by degreesher trade of renovating mattresses killed her
She was slowly poisoned by the emanations from the wool26 They were
all the worse that she worked almost entirely for the poor who have
cheap stuff to lie upon

She had the courage of a lion and an angels resignation She always
said to me in her low faint voice broken by a dry and frequent cough
I have not long to live breathing as I do lime and vitriol all day
long I spit blood and have spasms that make me faint

Why not change your trade have I said to her

Where will I find the time to make another apprenticeship she would
answer and it is now too late I feel that I am done for It is not my
fault added the good creature for I did not choose my employment
My father would have it so luckily he can do without me And then you
see when one is dead one cares for nothing and has no fear of slop
wages

Victorine uttered that sad common phrase very sincerely and with a
sort of satisfaction Therefore she died repeating At last

It is painful to think that the labor by which the poor man earns his
daily bread often becomes a long suicide I said this the other day to
Agricola he answered me that there were many other fatal employments
those who prepare aquafortis white lead or minium for instance are
sure to take incurable maladies of which they die

Do you know added Agricola what they say when they start for those
fatal worksWhy We are going to the slaughterhouse

That made me tremble with its terrible truth

And all this takes place in our day said I to him with an aching
heart and it is wellknown And out of so many of the rich and
powerful no one thinks of the mortality which decimates his brothers
thus forced to eat homicidal bread

What can you expect my poor sister answered Agricola When men are
to be incorporated that they may get killed in war all pains are taken
with them But when they are to be organized so as to live in peace
no one cares about it except M Hardy my master People say Pooh
hunger misery and suffering of the laboring classeswhat is that to
us that is not politics They are wrong added Agricola IT IS MORE
THAN POLITICS

As Victorine had not left anything to pay for the church service there
was only the presentation of the body under the porch for there is not
even a plain mass for the poor Besides as they could not give eighteen
francs to the curate no priest accompanied the paupers coffin to the
common grave If funerals thus abridged and cut short are sufficient
in a religious point of view why invent other and longer forms Is it
from cupidityIf on the other hand they are not sufficient why
make the poor man the only victim of this insufficiency But why trouble
ourselves about the pomp the incense the chants of which they are
either too sparing or too liberal Of what use and for what purpose
They are vain terrestrial things for which the soul recks nothing
when radiant it ascends towards its Creator Yesterday Agricola made
me read an article in a newspaper in which violent blame and bitter
irony are by turns employed to attack what they call the baneful
tendencies of some of the lower orders to improve themselves to write
to read the poets and sometimes to make verses Material enjoyments
are forbidden us by poverty Is it humane to reproach us for seeking the
enjoyments of the mind What harm can it do any one if every evening
after a days toil remote from all pleasure I amuse myself unknown to
all in making a few verses or in writing in this journal the good or
bad impressions I have received Is Agricola the worse workman because
on returning home to his mother he employs Sunday in composing some of
those popular songs which glorify the fruitful labors of the artisan
and say to all Hope and brotherhood Does he not make a more worthy use
of his time than if he spent it in a tavern Ah those who blame us for
these innocent and noble diversions which relieve our painful toils and
sufferings deceive themselves when they think that in proportion as
the intellect is raised and refined it is more difficult to bear with
privations and misery and that so the irritation increases against the
luckier few

Admitting even this to be the caseand it is not sois it not better
to have an intelligent enlightened enemy to whose heart and reason you
may address yourself than a stupid ferocious implacable foe But no
enmities disappear as the mind becomes enlightened and the horizon
of compassion extends itself We thus learn to understand moral
afflictions We discover that the rich also have to suffer intense
pains and that brotherhood in misfortune is already a link of sympathy
Alas they also have to mourn bitterly for idolized children beloved
mistresses reverend mothers with them also especially amongst the
women there are in the height of luxury and grandeur many broken
hearts many suffering souls many tears shed in secret Let them not be
alarmed By becoming their equals in intelligence the people will learn
to pity the rich if good and unhappyand to pity them still more if
rejoicing in wickedness

What happiness what a joyful day I am giddy with delight Oh truly
man is good humane charitable Oh yes the Creator has implanted
within him every generous instinctand unless he be a monstrous
exception he never does evil willingly Here is what I saw just now I
will not wait for the evening to write it down for my heart would as
it were have time to cool I had gone to carry home some work that was
wanted in a hurry I was passing the Place du Temple A few steps from
me I saw a child about twelve years old at most with bare head and
feet in spite of the severe weather dressed in a shabby ragged smock
frock and trousers leading by the bridle a large carthorse with his
harness still on From time to time the horse stopped short and refused
to advance The child who had no whip tugged in vain at the bridle
The horse remained motionless Then the poor little fellow cried out
O dear O dear and began to weep bitterly looking round him as if
to implore the assistance of the passersby His dear little face was
impressed with so heart piercing a sorrow that without reflecting I
made an attempt at which I can now only smile I must have presented so
grotesque a figure I am horribly afraid of horses and I am still more
afraid of exposing myself to public gaze Nevertheless I took courage
and having an umbrella in my hand I approached the horse and with the
impetuosity of an ant that strives to move a large stone with a little
piece of straw I struck with all my strength on the croup of the
rebellious animal Oh thanks my good lady exclaimed the child
drying his eyes hit him again if you please Perhaps he will get up

I began again heroically but alas either from obstinacy or
laziness the horse bent his knees and stretched himself out upon the
ground then getting entangled with his harness he tore it and broke
his great wooden collar I had drawn back quickly for fear of receiving
a kick Upon this new disaster the child could only throw himself on
his knees in the middle of the street clasping his hands and sobbing
and exclaiming in a voice of despair Help help

The call was heard several of the passersby gathered round and a
more efficacious correction than mine was administered to the restive
horse who rose in a vile state and without harness

My master will beat me cried the poor child as his tears redoubled
I am already two hours after time for the horse would not go and now
he has broken his harness My master will beat me and turn me away Oh
dear what will become of me I have no father nor mother

At these words uttered with a heartrending accent a worthy old
clothesdealer of the Temple who was amongst the spectators exclaimed
with a kindly air No father nor mother Do not grieve so my poor
little fellow the Temple can supply everything We will mend the
harness and if my gossips are like me you shall not go away
bareheaded or barefooted in such weather as this

This proposition was greeted with acclamation they led away both horse
and child some were occupied in mending the harness then one supplied
a cap another a pair of stockings another some shoes and another
a good jacket in a quarter of an hour the child was warmly clad the
harness repaired and a tall lad of eighteen brandishing a whip which
he cracked close to the horses ears by way of warning said to the
little boy who gazing first at his new clothes and then at the good
woman believed himself the hero of a fairytale Where does your
governor live little un

On the Quai du CanalSaintMartin sir answered he in a voice
trembling with joy

Very good said the young man I will help you take home the horse
who will go well enough with me and I will tell the master that the
delay was no fault of yourn A balky horse ought not to be trusted to a
child of your age

At the moment of setting out the poor little fellow said timidly to
the good dame as he took off his cap to her Will you let me kiss you
maam

His eyes were full of tears of gratitude There was heart in that
child This scene of popular charity gave me delightful emotions As
long as I could I followed with my eyes the tall young man and the
child who now could hardly keep up with the pace of the horse rendered
suddenly docile by fear of the whip

Yes I repeat it with pride man is naturally good and helpful
Nothing could have been more spontaneous than this movement of pity and
tenderness in the crowd when the poor little fellow exclaimed What
will become of me I have no father or mother

Unfortunate child said I to myself No father nor mother In the
hands of a brutal master who hardly covers him with a few rags and
ill treats him into the bargain Sleeping no doubt in the corner of
a stable Poor little fellow and yet so mild and good in spite of
misery and misfortune I saw ithe was even more grateful than pleased
at the service done him But perhaps this good natural disposition
abandoned without support or counsel or help and exasperated by bad
treatment may become changed and embitteredand then will come the age
of the passionsthe bad temptations

Oh in the deserted poor virtue is doubly saintly and respectable

This morning after having as usual gently reproached me for not
going to mass Agricolas mother said to me these words so touching in
her simple and believing mouth Luckily I pray for you and myself too
my poor girl the good God will hear me and you will only go I hope
to Purgatory

Good mother angelic soul she spoke those words in so grave and mild
a tone with so strong a faith in the happy result of her pious
intercession that I felt my eyes become moist and I threw myself on
her neck as sincerely grateful as if I had believed in Purgatory This
day has been a lucky one for me I hope I have found work which luck I
shall owe to a young person full of heart and goodness she is to take
me tomorrow to St Marys Convent where she thinks she can find me
employment

Florine already much moved by the reading started at this passage in
which Mother Bunch alluded to her ere she continued as follows

Never shall I forget with what touching interest what delicate
benevolence this handsome young girl received me so poor and so
unfortunate It does not astonish me for she is attached to the person
of Mdlle de Cardoville She must be worthy to reside with Agricolas
benefactress It will always be dear and pleasant to me to remember
her name It is graceful and pretty as her face it is Florine I am
nothing I have nothingbut if the fervent prayers of a grateful heart
might be heard Mdlle Florine would be happy very happy Alas I am
reduced to say prayers for heronly prayersfor I can do nothing but
remember and love her

These lines expressing so simply the sincere gratitude of the
hunchback gave the last blow to Florines hesitations She could no
longer resist the generous temptation she felt As she read these last
fragments of the journal her affection and respect for Mother Bunch
made new progress More than ever she felt how infamous it was in her
to expose to sarcasms and contempt the most secret thoughts of this
unfortunate creature Happily good is often as contagious as evil
Electrified by all that was warm noble and magnanimous in the pages
she had just read Florine bathed her failing virtue in that pure and
vivifying source and yielding at last to one of those good impulses
which sometimes carried her away she left the room with the manuscript
in her hand determined if Mother Bunch had not yet returned to
replace itresolved to tell Rodin that this second time her search
for the journal had been vain the sempstress having no doubt discovered
the first attempt

26 In the Ruche Populaire a working mans organ are the following
particulars

Carding MattressesThe dust which flies out of the wool makes carding
destructive to health in any case but trade adulterations enhance the
danger In sticking sheep the skin gets bloodspotted it has to be
bleached to make it salable Lime is the main whitener and some of it
clings to the wool after the process The dresser female most often
breathes in the fine dust and by lung and other complaints is far
from seldom deplorably situated the majority sicken of it and give up
the trade while those who keep to it at the very least suffer with a
catarrh or asthma that torments them until death

As for horsehair the very best is not pure You can judge what the
inferior quality is from the workgirls calling it vitriol hair because
it is the refuse or clippings from goats and swine washed in vitriol
boiled in dyes etc to burn and disguise such foreign bodies as straw
thorns splinters and even bits of skin not worth picking out The
dust rising when a mass of this is beaten makes as many ravages as the
limewool




CHAPTER XLVIII THE DISCOVERY

A little while before Florine made up her mind to atone for her shameful
breach of confidence Mother Bunch had returned from the factory after
accomplishing to the end her painful task After a long interview with
Angela struck like Agricola with the ingenuous grace sense and
goodness with which the young girl was endowed Mother Bunch had the
courageous frankness to advise the smith to enter into this marriage
The following scene took place whilst Florine still occupied in reading
the journal had not yet taken the praiseworthy resolution of replacing
it It was ten oclock at night The workgirl returned to Cardoville
House had just entered her chamber Worn out by so many emotions she
had thrown herself into a chair The deepest silence reigned in the
house It was now and then interrupted by the soughing of a high wind
which raged without and shook the trees in the garden A single candle
lighted the room which was papered with dark green That peculiar tint
and the hunchbacks black dress increased her apparent paleness Seated
in an armchair by the side of the fire with her head resting upon her
bosom her hands crossed upon her knees the workgirls countenance
was melancholy and resigned on it was visible the austere satisfaction
which is felt by the consciousness of a duty well performed

Like all those who brought up in the merciless school of misfortune no
longer exaggerate the sentiment of sorrow too familiar and assiduous
a guest to be treated as a stranger Mother Bunch was incapable of
long yielding to idle regrets and vain despair with regard to what
was already past Beyond doubt the blow had been sudden dreadful
doubtless it must leave a long and painful remembrance in the sufferers
soul but it was soon to pass as it were into that chronic state of
paindurance which had become almost an integral part of her life
And then this noble creature so indulgent to fate found still some
consolations in the intensity of her bitter pain She had been deeply
touched by the marks of affection shown her by Angela Agricolas
intended and she had felt a species of pride of the heart in
perceiving with what blind confidence with what ineffable joy the
smith accepted the favorable presentiments which seemed to consecrate
his happiness Mother Bunch also said to herself At least henceforth
I shall not be agitated by hopes or rather by suppositions as
ridiculous as they were senseless Agricolas marriage puts a term to
all the miserable reveries of my poor head

Finally she found a real and deep consolation in the certainty that
she had been able to go through this terrible trial and conceal from
Agricola the love she felt for him We know how formidable to this
unfortunate being were those ideas of ridicule and shame which she
believed would attach to the discovery of her mad passion After having
remained for some time absorbed in thought Mother Bunch rose and
advanced slowly towards the desk

My only recompense said she as she prepared the materials for
writing will be to entrust the mute witness of my pains with this new
grief I shall at least have kept the promise that I made to myself
Believing from the bottom of my soul that this girl is able to make
Agricola happy I told him so with the utmost sincerity One day a long
time hence when I shall read over these pages I shall perhaps find in
that a compensation for all that I now suffer

So saying she drew the box from the pigeonhole Not finding her
manuscript she uttered a cry of surprise but what was her alarm when
she perceived a letter to her address in the place of the journal She
became deadly pale her knees trembled she almost fainted away But her
increasing terror gave her a fictitious energy and she had the strength
to break the seal A banknote for five hundred francs fell from the
letter on the table and Mother Bunch read as follows

MademoiselleThere is something so original and amusing in reading in
your memoirs the story of your love for Agricola that it is impossible
to resist the pleasure of acquainting him with the extent of it of
which he is doubtless ignorant but to which he cannot fail to show
himself sensible Advantage will be taken to forward it to a multitude
of other persons who might perhaps otherwise be unfortunately
deprived of the amusing contents of your diary Should copies and
extracts not be sufficient we will have it printed as one cannot
too much diffuse such things Some will weepothers will laughwhat
appears superb to one set of people will seem ridiculous to another
such is lifebut your journal will surely make a great sensation As
you are capable of wishing to avoid your triumph and as you were only
covered with rags when you were received out of charity into this
house where you wish to figure as the great lady which does not suit
your shape for more reasons than one we enclose in the present five
hundred francs to pay for your daybook and prevent your being without
resources in case you should be modest enough to shrink from the
congratulations which await you certain to overwhelm you by tomorrow
for at this hour your journal is already in circulation

One of your brethren

A REAL MOTHER BUNCH

The vulgar mocking and insolent tone of this letter which was
purposely written in the character of a jealous lackey dissatisfied
with the admission of the unfortunate creature into the house had
been calculated with infernal skill and was sure to produce the effect
intended

Oh good heaven were the only words the unfortunate girl could
pronounce in her stupor and alarm

Now if we remember in what passionate terms she had expressed her love
for her adopted brother if we recall many passages of this manuscript
in which she revealed the painful wounds often inflicted on her by
Agricola without knowing it and if we consider how great was her
terror of ridicule we shall understand her mad despair on reading this
infamous letter Mother Bunch did not think for a moment of all the
noble words and touching narratives contained in her journal The one
horrible idea which weighed down the troubled spirit of the unfortunate
creature was that on the morrow Agricola Mdlle de Cardoville and an
insolent and mocking crowd would be informed of this ridiculous love
which would she imagined crush her with shame and confusion This new
blow was so stunning that the recipient staggered a moment beneath the
unexpected shock For some minutes she remained completely inert
and helpless then upon reflection she suddenly felt conscious of a
terrible necessity

This hospitable mansion where she had found a sure refuge after so many
misfortunes must be left for ever The trembling timidity and sensitive
delicacy of the poor creature did not permit her to remain a minute more
in this dwelling where the most secret recesses of her soul had been
laid open profaned and exposed no doubt to sarcasm and contempt
She did not think of demanding justice and revenge from Mdlle de
Cardoville To cause a ferment of trouble and irritation in this house
at the moment of quitting it would have appeared to her ingratitude
towards her benefactress She did not seek to discover the author or
the motive of this odious robbery and insulting letter Why should she
resolved as she was to fly from the humiliations with which she was
threatened She had a vague notion as indeed was intended that
this infamy might be the work of some of the servants jealous of the
affectionate deference shown her by Mdlle de Cardovilleand this
thought filled her with despair Those pagesso painfully confidential
which she would not have ventured to impart to the most tender and
indulgent mother because written as it were with her hearts blood
they painted with too cruel a fidelity the thousand secret wounds of her
soulthose pages were to serve perhaps served even now for the jest
and laughingstock of the lackeys of the mansion

The money which accompanied this letter and the insulting way in which
it was offered rather tended to confirm her suspicions It was intended
that the fear of misery should not be the obstacle of her leaving the
house The workgirls resolution was soon taken with that calm and firm
resignation which was familiar to her She rose with somewhat bright
and haggard eyes but without a tear in them Since the day before she
had wept too much With a trembling icy hand she wrote these words
on a paper which she left by the side of the banknote May Mdlle de
Cardoville be blessed for all that she has done for me and forgive me
for having left her house where I can remain no longer

Having written this Mother Bunch threw into the fire the infamous
letter which seemed to burn her hands Then taking a last look at her
chamber furnished so comfortably she shuddered involuntarily as she
thought of the misery that awaited hera misery more frightful than
that of which she had already been the victim for Agricolas mother
had departed with Gabriel and the unfortunate girl could no longer as
formerly be consoled in her distress by the almost maternal affection
of Dagoberts wife To live alonequite alonewith the thought that
her fatal passion for Agricola was laughed at by everybody perhaps even
by himselfsuch were the future prospects of the hunchback This future
terrified hera dark desire crossed her mindshe shuddered and an
expression of bitter joy contracted her features Resolved to go she
made some steps towards the door when in passing before the fireplace
she saw her own image in the glass pale as death and clothed in black
then it struck her that she wore a dress which did not belong to her
and she remembered a passage in the letter which alluded to the rags
she had on before she entered that house True said she with a heart
breaking smile as she looked at her black garments they would call me
a thief

And taking her candle she entered the little dressing room and put on
again the poor old clothes which she had preserved as a sort of pious
remembrance of her misfortunes Only at this instant did her tears flow
abundantly She weptnot in sorrow at resuming the garb of misery but
in gratitude for all the comforts around her to which she was about
to bid an eternal adieu recalled to her mind at every step the delicacy
and goodness of Mdlle de Cardoville therefore yielding to an almost
involuntary impulse after she had put on her poor old clothes she
fell on her knees in the middle of the room and addressing herself
in thought to Mdlle de Cardoville she exclaimed in a voice broken by
convulsive sobs Adieu oh for ever adieuYou that deigned to call
me friendand sister

Suddenly she rose in alarm she heard steps in the corridor which led
from the garden to one of the doors of her apartment the other door
opening into the parlor It was Florine who alas too late was
bringing back the manuscript Alarmed at this noise of footsteps and
believing herself already the laughingstock of the house Mother Bunch
rushed from the room hastened across the parlor gained the courtyard
and knocked at the window of the porters lodge The housedoor opened
and immediately closed upon her And so the workgirl left Cardoville
House

Adrienne was thus deprived of a devoted faithful and vigilant
guardian Rodin was delivered from an active and sagacious antagonist
whom he had always with good reason feared Having as we have seen
guessed Mother Bunchs love for Agricola and knowing her to be a
poet the Jesuit supposed logically enough that she must have written
secretly some verses inspired by this fatal and concealed passion Hence
the order given to Florine to try and discover some written evidence
of this love hence this letter so horribly effective in its coarse
ribaldry of which it must be observed Florine did not know the
contents having received it after communicating a summary of the
contents of the manuscript which the first time she had only glanced
through without taking it away We have said that Florine yielding
too late to a generous repentance had reached Mother Bunchs apartment
just as the latter quitted the house in consternation

Perceiving a light in the dressingroom the waitingmaid hastened
thither She saw upon a chair the black dress that Mother Bunch had just
taken off and a few steps further the shabby little trunk open and
empty in which she had hitherto preserved her poor garments Florines
heart sank within her she ran to the secretary the disorder of the
cardboard boxes the note for five hundred francs left by the side
of the two lines written to Mdlle de Cardoville all proved that her
obedience to Rodins orders had borne fatal fruit and that Mother Bunch
had quitted the house for ever Finding the uselessness of her tardy
resolution Florine resigned herself with a sigh to the necessity of
delivering the manuscript to Rodin Then forced by the fatality of her
miserable position to console herself for evil by evil she considered
that the hunchbacks departure would at least make her treachery less
dangerous

Two days after these events Adrienne received the following note from
Rodin in answer to a letter she had written him to inform him of the
workgirls inexplicable departure

MY DEAR YOUNG LADYObliged to set out this morning for the factory of
the excellent M Hardy whither I am called by an affair of importance
it is impossible for me to pay you my humble respects You ask me what I
think of the disappearance of this poor girl I really do not know The
future will I doubt not explain all to her advantage Only remember
what I told you at Dr Baleiniers with regard to a certain society and
its secret emissaries with whom it has the art of surrounding those
it wishes to keep a watch on I accuse no one but let us only recall
facts This poor girl accused me and I am as you know the most
faithful of your servants She possessed nothing and yet five hundred
francs were found in her secretary You loaded her with favors and
she leaves your house without even explaining the cause of this
extraordinary flight I draw no conclusion my dear young lady I am
always unwilling to condemn without evidence but reflect upon all this
and be on your guard for you have perhaps escaped a great danger
Be more circumspect and suspicious than ever such at least is the
respectful advice of your most obedient humble servant

Rodin




CHAPTER XLIX THE TRYSTINGPLACE OF THE WOLVES

It was a Sunday morning the very day on which Mdlle de Cardoville had
received Rodins letter with regard to Mother Bunchs disappearance
Two men were talking to together seated at a table in one of the public
houses in the little village of Villiers situated at no great distance
from Hardys factory The village was for the most part inhabited
by quarrymen and stonecutters employed in working the neighboring
quarries Nothing can be ruder and more laborious and at the same time
less adequately paid than the work of this class of people Therefore
as Agricola had told Mother Bunch they drew painful comparisons
between their condition almost always miserable and the comfort and
comparative ease enjoyed by M Hardys workmen thanks to his generous
and intelligent management and to the principles of association
and community which he had put in practice amongst them Misery and
ignorance are always the cause of great evils Misery is easily excited
to anger and ignorance soon yields to perfidious counsels For a long
time the happiness of M Hardys workmen had been naturally envied but
not with a jealousy amounting to hatred As soon however as the secret
enemies of the manufacturer uniting with his rival Baron Tripeaud
had an interest in changing this peaceful state of thingsit changed
accordingly

With diabolical skill and perseverance they succeeded in kindling the
most evil passions By means of chosen emissaries they applied to those
quarrymen and stonecutters of the neighborhood whose bad conduct had
aggravated their misery Notorious for their turbulence audacity and
energy these men might exercise a dangerous influence on the majority
of their companions who were peaceful laborious and honest but
easily intimidated by violence These turbulent leaders previously
embittered by misfortune were soon impressed with an exaggerated idea
of the happiness of M Hardys workmen and excited to a jealous hatred
of them They went still further the incendiary sermons of an abbe
a member of the Jesuits who had come expressly from Paris to preach
during Lent against M Hardy acted powerfully on the minds of the
women who filled the church whilst their husbands were haunting
the taverns Profiting by the growing fear which the approach of the
Cholera then inspired the preacher struck with terror these weak and
credulous imaginations by pointing to M Hardys factory as a centre
of corruption and damnation capable of drawing down the vengeance of
Heaven and bringing the fatal scourge upon the country Thus the men
already inflamed with envy were still more excited by the incessant
urgency of their wives who maddened by the abbes sermons poured
their curses on that band of atheists who might bring down so many
misfortunes upon them and their children Some bad characters belonging
to the factory of Baron Tripeaud and paid by him for it was a great
interest the honorable manufacturer had in the ruin of M Hardy came
to augment the general irritation and to complete it by raising one
of those alarming unionquestions which in our day have unfortunately
caused so much bloodshed Many of M Hardys workmen before they
entered his employ had belonged to a society or union called the
Devourers while many of the stonecutters in the neighboring quarries
belonged to a society called the Wolves Now for a long time an
implacable rivalry had existed between the Wolves and Devourers and
brought about many sanguinary struggles which are the more to be
deplored as in some respects the idea of these unions is excellent
being founded on the fruitful and mighty principle of association
But unfortunately instead of embracing all trades in one fraternal
communion these unions break up the workingclass into distinct and
hostile societies whose rivalry often leads to bloody collisions27
For the last week the Wolves excited by so many different
importunities burned to discover an occasion or a pretext to come
to blows with the Devourers but the latter not frequenting the
publichouses and hardly leaving the factory during the week had
hitherto rendered such a meeting impossible and the Wolves had been
forced to wait for the Sunday with ferocious impatience

Moreover a great number of the quarrymen and stonecutters being
peaceable and hardworking people had refused though Wolves themselves
to join this hostile manifestation against the Devourers of M Hardys
factory the leaders had been obliged to recruit their forces from the
vagabonds and idlers of the barriers whom the attraction of tumult and
disorder had easily enlisted under the flag of the warlike Wolves Such
then was the dull fermentation which agitated the little village of
Villiers whilst the two men of whom we have spoken were at table in the
publichouse

These men had asked for a private room that they might be alone One of
them was still young and pretty well dressed But the disorder in his
clothes his loose cravat his shirt spotted with wine his dishevelled
hair his look of fatigue his marble complexion his bloodshot eyes
announced that a night of debauch had preceded this morning whilst
his abrupt and heavy gesture his hoarse voice his look sometimes
brilliant and sometimes stupid proved that to the last fumes of the
intoxication of the night before were joined the first attacks of a
new state of drunkenness The companion of this man said to him as he
touched his glass with his own Your health my boy

Yours answered the young man though you look to me like the devil

Ithe devil

Yes

Why

How did you come to know me

Do you repent that you ever knew me

Who told you that I was a prisoner at SaintePelagie

Didnt I take you out of prison

Why did you take me out

Because I have a good heart

You are very fond of me perhapsjust as the butcher likes the ox that
he drives to the slaughterhouse

Are you mad

A man does not pay a hundred thousand francs for another without a
motive

I have a motive

What is it what do you want to do with me

A jolly companion that will spend his money like a man and pass every
night like the last Good wine good cheer pretty girls and gay songs
Is that such a bad trade

After he had remained a moment without answering the young man replied
with a gloomy air Why on the eve of my leaving prison did you attach
this condition to my freedom that I should write to my mistress to tell
her that I would never see her again Why did you exact this letter from
me

A sigh what are you still thinking of her

Always

You are wrong Your mistress is far from Paris by this time I saw
her get into the stagecoach before I came to take you out of Sainte
Pelagie

Yes I was stifled in that prison To get out I would have given my
soul to the devil You thought so and therefore you came to me only
instead of my soul you took Cephyse from me Poor BacchanalQueen And
why did you do it Thousand thunders Will you tell me

A man as much attached to his mistress as you are is no longer a man
He wants energy when the occasion requires

What occasion

Let us drink

You make me drink too much brandy

Bah look at me

Thats what frightens me It seems something devilish A bottle of
brandy does not even make you wink You must have a stomach of iron and
a head of marble

I have long travelled in Russia There we drink to roast ourselves

And here to only warm Solets drinkbut wine

Nonsense wine is fit for children Brandy for men like us

Well then brandy but it burns and sets the head on fire and then
we see all the flames of hell

Thats how I like to see you hang it

But when you told me that I was too much attached to my mistress and
that I should want energy when the occasion required of what occasion
did you speak

Let us drink

Stop a moment comrade I am no more of a fool than others Your half
words have taught me something

Well what

You know that I have been a workman that I have many companions and
that being a good fellow I am much liked amongst them You want me for
a catspaw to catch other chestnuts

What then

You must be some getterup of riotssome speculator in revolts

What next

You are travelling for some anonymous society that trades in musket
shots

Are you a coward

I burned powder in July I can tell youmake no mistakes

You would not mind burning some again

Just as well that sort of fireworks as any other Only I find
revolutions more agreeable than useful all that I got from the
barricades of the three days was burnt breeches and a lost jacket All
the cause won by me with its Forward March says

You know many of Hardys workmen

Oh thats why you have brought me down here

Yesyou will meet with many of the workmen from the factory

Men from Hardys take part in a row No no they are too well off for
that You have been sold

You will see presently

I tell you they are well off What have they to complain of

What of their brethrenthose who have not so good a master and die
of hunger and misery and call on them for assistance Do you think they
will remain deaf to such a summons Hardy is only an exception Let the
people but give a good pull all together and the exception will become
the rule and all the world be happy

What you say there is true but it would be a devil of a pull that
would make an honest man out of my old master Baron Tripeaud who made
me what I aman outandout rip

Hardys workmen are coming you are their comrade and have no interest
in deceiving them They will believe you Join with me in persuading
them

To what

To leave this factory in which they grow effeminate and selfish and
forget their brothers

But if they leave the factory how are they to live

We will provide for thaton the great day

And whats to be done till then

What you have done last nightdrink laugh sing and by way of work
exercise themselves privately in the use of arms

Who will bring these workmen here

Some one has already spoken to them They have had printed papers
reproaching them with indifference to their brothers Come will you
support me

Ill support youthe more readily as I cannot very well support
myself I only cared for Cephyse in the world I know that I am on a bad
road you are pushing me on further let the ball rollWhether we
go to the devil one way or the other is not of much consequence Lets
drink

Drink to our next nights fun the last was only apprenticeship

Of what then are you made I looked at you and never saw you either
blush or smile or change countenance You are like a man of iron

I am not a lad of fifteen It would take something more to make me
laugh I shall laugh tonight

I dont know if its the brandy but devil take me if you dont
frighten me when you say you shall laugh tonight

So saying the young man rose staggering he began to be once more
intoxicated

There was a knock at the door Come in The host made his appearance

Whats the matter

Theres a young man below who calls himself Olivier He asks for M
Morok

Thats right Let him came up The host went out

It is one of our men but he is alone said Morok whose savage
countenance expressed disappointment It astonishes me for I expected
a good number Do you know him

Olivier Yesa fair chap I think

We shall see him directly Here he is A young man with an open
bold intelligent countenance at this moment entered the room

What old Sleepinbuff he exclaimed at sight of Moroks companion

Myself I have not seen you for an age Olivier

Simple enough my boy We do not work at the same place

But you are alone cried Morok and pointing to Sleepinbuff he added
You may speak before himhe is one of us But why are you alone

I come alone but in the name of my comrades

Oh said Morok with a sigh of satisfaction they consent

They refusejust as I do

What the devil they refuse Have they no more courage than women
cried Morok grinding his teeth with rage

Hark ye answered Olivier coolly We have received your letters
and seen your agent We have had proof that he is really connected with
great societies many members of which are known to us

Well why do you hesitate

First of all nothing proves that these societies are ready to make a
movement

I tell you they are

Hetells youthey are said Sleepinbuff stammering and I hic
affirm it Forward March

Thats not enough replied Olivier Besides we have reflected upon
it For a week the factory was divided Even yesterday the discussion
was too warm to be pleasant But this morning Father Simon called to
him we explained ourselves fully before him and he brought us all to
one mind We mean to wait and if any disturbance breaks out we shall
see

Is that your final word

It is our last word

Silence cried Sleepinbuff suddenly as he listened balancing
himself on his tottering legs It is like the noise of a crowd not far
off A dull sound was indeed audible which became every moment more
and more distinct and at length grew formidable

What is that said Olivier in surprise

Now replied Morok smiling with a sinister air I remember the host
told me there was a great ferment in the village against the factory If
you and your other comrades had separated from Hardys other workmen as
I hoped these people who are beginning to howl would have been for you
instead of against you

This was a trap then to set one half of M Hardys workmen against
the other cried Olivier you hoped that we should make common cause
with these people against the factory and that

The young man had not time to finish A terrible outburst of shouts
howls and hisses shook the tavern At the same instant the door was
abruptly opened and the host pale and trembling hurried into the
chamber exclaiming Gentlemen do any of you work at M Hardys
factory

I do said Olivier

Then you are lost Here are the Wolves in a body saying there are
Devourers here from M Hardys and offering them battleunless the
Devourers will give up the factory and range themselves on their side

It was a trap there can be no doubt of it cried Olivier looking at
Morok and Sleepinbuff with a threatening air if my mates had come we
were all to be let in

I lay a trap Olivier stammered Jacques Rennepont Never

Battle to the Devourers or let them join the Wolves cried the angry
crowd with one voice as they appeared to invade the house

Come exclaimed the host Without giving Olivier time to answer he
seized him by the arm and opening a window which led to a roof at no
very great height from the ground he said to him Make your escape by
this window let yourself slide down and gain the fields it is time

As the young workman hesitated the host added with a look of terror

Alone against a couple of hundred what can you do A minute more and
you are lost Do you not hear them They have entered the yard they are
coming up

Indeed at this moment the groans the hisses and cheers redoubled
in violence the wooden staircase which led to the first story shook
beneath the quick steps of many persons and the shout arose loud and
piercing Battle to the Devourers

Fly Olivier cried Sleepinbuff almost sobered by the danger

Hardly had he pronounced the words when the door of the large room
which communicated with the small one in which they were was burst open
with a frightful crash

Here they are cried the host clasping his hands in alarm Then
running to Olivier he pushed him as it were out of the window for
with one foot on the sill the workman still hesitated

The window once closed the publican returned towards Morok the instant
the latter entered the large room into which the leaders of the Wolves
had just forced an entry whilst their companions were vociferating in
the yard and on the staircase Eight or ten of these madmen urged by
others to take part in these scenes of disorder had rushed first into
the room with countenances inflamed by wine and anger most of them
were armed with long sticks A blaster of Herculean strength and
stature with an old red handkerchief about his head its ragged
ends streaming over his shoulders miserably dressed in a halfworn
goatskin brandished an iron drillingrod and appeared to direct the
movements With bloodshot eyes threatening and ferocious countenance
he advanced towards the small room as if to drive back Morok and
exclaimed in a voice of thunder

Where are the Devourersthe Wolves will eat em up

The host hastened to open the door of the small room saying There is
no one here my friendsno one Look for yourselves

It is true said the quarryman surprised after peeping into the
room where are they then We were told there were a dozen of them
here They should have marched with us against the factory or thered
a been a battle and the Wolves would have tried their teeth

If they have not come said another they will come Lets wait

Yes yes we will wait for them

We will look close at each other

If the Wolves want to see the Devourers said Morok why not go and
howl round the factory of the miscreant atheists At the first howl of
the Wolves they will come out and give you battle

They will give youbattle repeated Sleepinbuff mechanically

Unless the Wolves are afraid of the Devourers added Morok

Since you talk of fear you shall go with us and see whos afraid
cried the formidable blaster and in a thundering voice he advanced
towards Morok

A number of voices joined in with Who says the Wolves are afraid of
the Devourers

It would be the first time

Battle battle and make an end of it

We are tired of all this Why should we be so miserable and they so
well off

They have said that quarrymen are brutes only fit to torn wheels in a
shaft like dogs to turn spits cried an emissary of Baron Tripeauds

And that the Devourers would make themselves caps with wolfskin
added another

Neither they nor their wives ever go to mass They are pagans and
dogs cried an emissary of the preaching abbe

The men might keep their Sunday as they pleased but their wives not to
go to massit is abominable

And therefore the curate has said that their factory because of its
abominations might bring down the cholera to the country

True he said that in his sermon

Our wives heard it

Yes yes down with the Devourers who want to bring the cholera on the
country

Hooray for a fight cried the crowd in chorus

To the factory my brave Wolves cried Morok with the voice of a
Stentor on to the factory

Yes to the factory to the factory repeated the crowd with furious
stamping for little by little all who could force their way into the
room or up the stairs had there collected together

These furious cries recalling Jacques for a moment to his senses he
whispered to Morok It is slaughter you would provoke I wash my hands
of it

We shall have time to let them know at the factory We can give these
fellows the slip on the road answered Morok Then he cried aloud
addressing the host who was terrified at this disorder Brandylet
us drink to the health of the brave Wolves I will stand treat He
threw some money to the host who disappeared and soon returned with
several bottles of brandy and some glasses

What glasses cried Morok Do jolly companions like we are drink
out of glasses So saying he forced out one of the corks raised the
neck of the bottle to his lips and having drunk a deep draught passed
it to the gigantic quarryman

Thats the thing said the latter Heres in honor of the
treatNone but a sneak will refuse for this stuff will sharpen the
Wolves teeth

Heres to your health mates said Morok distributing the bottles

There will be blood at the end of all this muttered Sleepinbuff who
in spite of his intoxication perceived all the danger of these fatal
incitements Indeed a large portion of the crowd was already quitting
the yard of the publichouse and advancing rapidly towards M Hardys
factory

Those of the workmen and inhabitants of the village who had not chosen
to take any part in this movement of hostility they were the majority
did not make their appearance as this threatening troop passed along
the principal street but a good number of women excited to fanaticism
by the sermons of the abbe encouraged the warlike assemblage with
their cries At the head of the troop advanced the gigantic blaster
brandishing his formidable bar followed by a motley mass armed with
sticks and stones Their heads still warmed by their recent libations
of brandy they had now attained a frightful state of frenzy Their
countenances were ferocious inflamed terrible This unchaining of
the worst passions seemed to forbode the most deplorable consequences
Holding each other arminarm and walking four or five together the
Wolves gave vent to their excitement in warsongs which closed with the
following verse

Forward full of assurance Let us try our vigorous arms They have
wearied out our prudence Let us show weve no alarms Sprung from a
monarch glorious28 Today well not grow pale Whether we win the
fight or fail Whether we die or are victorious Children of Solomon
mighty king All your efforts together bring Till in triumph we shall
sing

Morok and Jacques had disappeared whilst the tumultuous troop were
leaving the tavern to hasten to the factory

27 Let it be noted to the workingmans credit that such outrageous
scenes become more and more rare as he is enlightened to the full
consciousness of his worth Such better tendencies are to be attributed
to the just influence of an excellent tract on trades union written
by M Agricole Perdignier and published in 1841 Paris This author a
joiner founded at his own expense an establishment in the Faubourg St
Antoine where some forty or fifty of his trade lodged and were given
after the days work a course of geometry etc applied to wood
carving We went to one of the lectures and found as much clearness
in the professor as attention and intelligence in the audience At ten
after reading selections all the lodgers retire forced by their scanty
wages to sleep perhaps four in a room M Perdignier informed us that
study and instruction were such powerful ameliorators that during
six years he had only one of his lodgers to expel In a few days
he remarked the bad eggs find out this is no place for them to addle
sound ones We are happy to hear reader public homage to a learned
and upright man devoted to his fellowworkmen

28 The Wolves among others ascribe the institution of their company
to King Solomon See the curious work by M Agricole Perdignier from
which the warsong is extracted




CHAPTER L THE COMMON DWELLINGHOUSE

Whilst the Wolves as we have just seen prepared a savage attack on
the Devourers the factory of M Hardy had that morning a festal air
perfectly in accordance with the serenity of the sky for the wind was
from the north and pretty sharp for a fine day in March The clock had
just struck nine in the Common Dwellinghouse of the workmen separated
from the workshops by a broad path planted with trees The rising sun
bathed in light this imposing mass of buildings situated a league from
Paris in a gay and salubrious locality from which were visible the
woody and picturesque hills that on this side overlook the great city
Nothing could be plainer and yet more cheerful than the aspect of the
Common Dwellinghouse of the workmen Its slanting roof of red tiles
projected over white walls divided here and there by broad rows of
bricks which contrasted agreeably with the green color of the blinds on
the first and second stories

These buildings open to the south and east were surrounded by a large
garden of about ten acres partly planted with trees and partly laid
out in fruit and kitchengarden Before continuing this description
which perhaps will appear a little like a fairytale let us begin by
saying that the wonders of which we are about to present the sketch
must not to be considered Utopian dreams nothing on the contrary
could be of a more positive character and we are able to assert and
even to prove what in our time is of great weight and interest
that these wonders were the result of an excellent speculation and
represented an investment as lucrative as it was secure To undertake
a vast noble and most useful enterprise to bestow on a considerable
number of human creatures an ideal prosperity compared with the
frightful almost homicidal doom to which they are generally condemned
to instruct them and elevate them in their own esteem to make them
prefer to the coarse pleasures of the tavern or rather to the fatal
oblivion which they find there as an escape from the consciousness
of their deplorable destiny the pleasures of the intellect and the
enjoyments of art in a word to make men moral by making them happy
and finally thanks to this generous example so easy of imitation to
take a place amongst the benefactors of humanityand yet at the same
time to do as it were without knowing it an excellent stroke of
businessmay appear fabulous And yet this was the secret of the
wonders of which we speak

Let us enter the interior of the factory Ignorant of Mother Bunchs
cruel disappearance Agricola gave himself up to the most happy
thoughts as he recalled Angelas image and having finished dressing
with unusual care went in search of his betrothed

Let us say two words on the subject of the lodging which the smith
occupied in the Common Dwellinghouse at the incredibly low rate
of seventyfive francs per annum like the other bachelors on the
establishment This lodging situated on the second story was comprised
of a capital chamber and bedroom with a southern aspect and looking
on the garden the pine floor was perfectly white and clean the iron
bedstead was supplied with a good mattress and warm coverings a gas
burner and a warmair pipe were also introduced into the rooms to
furnish light and heat as required the walls were hung with pretty
fancy papering and had curtains to match a chest of drawers a walnut
table a few chairs a small library comprised Agricolas furniture
Finally in the large and light closet was a place for his clothes a
dressing table and large zinc basin with an ample supply of water
If we compare this agreeable salubrious comfortable lodging with the
dark icy dilapidated garret for which the worthy fellow paid ninety
francs at his mothers and to get to which he had more than a league
and a half to go every evening we shall understand the sacrifice he
made to his affection for that excellent woman

Agricola after casting a last glance of tolerable satisfaction at his
lookingglass while he combed his moustache and imperial quitted his
chamber to go and join Angela in the womens workroom The corridor
along which he had to pass was broad welllighted from above floored
with pine and extremely clean Notwithstanding some seeds of discord
which had been lately sown by M Hardys enemies amongst his workmen
until now so fraternally united joyous songs were heard in almost
all the apartments which skirted the corridor and as Agricola passed
before several open doors he exchanged a cordial goodmorrow with many
of his comrades The smith hastily descended the stairs crossed
the court yard in which was a grassplot planted with trees with a
fountain in the centre and gained the other wing of the building There
was the workroom in which a portion of the wives and daughters of the
associated artisans who happened not to be employed in the factory
occupied themselves in making up the linen This labor joined to the
enormous saving effected by the purchase of the materials wholesale
reduced to an incredible extent the price of each article After
passing through this workroom a vast apartment looking on the garden
wellaired in summer29 and wellwarmed in winter Agricola knocked at
the door of the rooms occupied by Angelas mother

If we say a few words with regard to this lodging situated on the first
story with an eastern aspect and also looking on the garden it is
that we may tape it as a specimen of the habitation of a family in this
association supplied at the incredibly small price of one hundred and
twentyfive francs per annum

A small entrance opening on the corridor led to a large room on each
side of which was a smaller chamber destined for the family when the
boys and girls were too big to continue to sleep in the two dormitories
arranged after the fashion of a large school and reserved for the
children of both sexes Every night the superintendence of these
dormitories was entrusted to a father and mother of a family belonging
to the association The lodging of which we speak being like all the
others disencumbered of the paraphernalia of a kitchenfor the
cooking was done in common and on a large scale in another part of the
buildingwas kept extremely clean A pretty large piece of carpet
a comfortable armchair some prettylooking china on a stand of well
polished wood some prints hung against the walls a clock of gilt
bronze a bed a chest of drawers and a mahogany secretary announced
that the inhabitants of this apartment enjoyed not only the necessaries
but some of the luxuries of life Angela who from this time might
be called Agricolas betrothed justified in every point the flattering
portrait which the smith had drawn of her in his interview with poor
Mother Bunch The charming girl seventeen years of age at most dressed
with as much simplicity as neatness was seated by the side of her
mother When Agricola entered she blushed slightly at seeing him

Mademoiselle said Agricola I have come to keep my promise if your
mother has no objection

Certainly M Agricola answered the mother of the young girl
cordially She would not go over the Common Dwellinghouse with her
father her brother or me because she wished to have that pleasure
with you today It is quite right that you who can talk so well should
do the honors of the house to the newcomer She has been waiting for
you an hour and with such impatience

Pray excuse me mademoiselle said Agricola gayly in thinking of
the pleasure of seeing you I forgot the hour That is my only excuse

Oh mother said the young girl in a tone of mild reproach and
becoming red as a cherry why did you say that

Is it true yes or no I do not blame you for it on the contrary Go
with M Agricola child and he will tell you better than I can what
all the workmen of the factory owe to M Hardy

M Agricola said Angela tying the ribbons of her pretty cap what a
pity that your good little adopted sister is not with us

Mother Bunchyes you are right mademoiselle but that is only a
pleasure put off and the visit she paid us yesterday will not be the
last

Having embraced her mother the girl took Agricolas arm and they went
out together

Dear me M Agricola said Angela if you knew how much I was
surprised on entering this fine house after being accustomed to see so
much misery amongst the poor workmen in our country and in which I too
have had my share whilst here everybody seems happy and contented It
is really like fairyland I think I am in a dream and when I ask my
mother the explanation of these wonders she tells me M Agricola will
explain it all to you

Do you know why I am so happy to undertake that delightful task
mademoiselle said Agricola with an accent at once grave and tender
Nothing could be more in season

Why so M Agricola

Because to show you this house to make you acquainted with all the
resources of our association is to be able to say to you Here the
workman sure of the present sure of the future is not like so many
of his poor brothers obliged to renounce the sweetest want of the
heartthe desire of choosing a companion for lifein the fear of
uniting misery to misery

Angela cast down her eyes and blushed

Here the workman may safely yield to the hope of knowing the sweet joys
of a family sure of not having his heart torn hereafter by the sight
of the horrible privations of those who are dear to him here thanks to
order and industry and the wise employment of the strength of all men
women and children live happy and contented In a ward to explain all
this to you mademoiselle added Agricola smiling with a still more
tender air is to prove that here we can do nothing more reasonable
than love nothing wiser than marry

M Agricola answered Angela in a slightly agitated voice and
blushing still more as she spoke suppose we were to begin our walk

Directly mademoiselle replied the smith pleased at the trouble
he had excited in that ingenuous soul But come we are near the
dormitory of the little girls The chirping birds have long left their
nests Let us go there

Willingly M Agricola

The young smith and Angela soon entered a spacious dormitory resembling
that of a firstrate boarding school The little iron bedsteads were
arranged in symmetrical order at each end were the beds of the two
mothers of families who took the superintendence by turns

Dear me how well it is arranged M Agricola and how neat and clean
Who is it that takes such good care of it

The children themselves we have no servants here There is an
extraordinary emulation between these urchinsas to who shall make her
bed most neatly and it amuses them quite as much as making a bed for
their dolls Little girls you know delight in playing at keeping
house Well here they play at it in good earnest and the house is
admirably kept in consequence

Oh I understand They turn to account their natural taste for all such
kinds of amusement

That is the whole secret You will see them everywhere usefully
occupied and delighted at the importance of the employments given
them

Oh M Agricola said Angela timidly only compare these fine
dormitories so warm and healthy with the horrible icy garrets where
children are heaped pellmell on a wretched strawmattress shivering
with cold as in the case with almost all the workmens families in our
country

And in Paris mademoiselle it is even worse

Oh how kind generous and rich must M Hardy be to spend so much
money in doing good

I am going to astonish you mademoiselle said Agricola with a smile
to astonish you so much that perhaps you will not believe me

Why so M Agricola

There is not certainly in the world a man with a better and more
generous heart than M Hardy he does good for its own sake and without
thinking of his personal interest And yet Mdlle Angela were he the
most selfish and avaricious of men he would still find it greatly to
his advantage to put us in a position to be as comfortable as we are

Is it possible M Agricola You tell me so and I believe it but if
good can so easily be done if there is even an advantage in doing it
why is it not more commonly attempted

Ah mademoiselle it requires three gifts very rarely met with in the
same personknowledge power and will

Alas yes Those who have the knowledge have not the power

And those who have the power have neither the knowledge nor the will

But how does M Hardy find any advantage in the good he does for you

I will explain that presently mademoiselle

Oh what a nice sweet smell of fruit said Angela suddenly

Our common fruitstore is close at hand I wager we shall find there
some of the little birds from the dormitorynot occupied in picking and
stealing but hard at work

Opening a door Agricola led Angela into a large room furnished with
shelves on which the winter fruits were arranged in order A number
of children from seven to eight years old neatly and warmly clad
and glowing with health exerted themselves cheerfully under the
superintendence of a woman in separating and sorting the spoiled fruit

You see said Agricola wherever it is possible we make use of the
children These occupations are amusements for them answering to the
need of movement and activity natural to their age and in this way we
can employ the grown girls and the women to much better advantage

True M Agricola how well it is all arranged

And if you saw what services the urchins in the kitchen render
Directed by one or two women they do the work of eight or ten
servants

In fact said Angela smiling at their age we like so much to play
at cooking dinner They must be delighted

And in the same way under pretext of playing at gardening they weed
the ground gather the fruit and vegetables water the flowers roll the
paths and so on In a word this army of infantworkers who generally
remain till ten or twelve years of age without being of any service
are here very useful Except three hours of school which is quite
sufficient for them from the age of six or seven their recreations are
turned to good account and the dear little creatures by the saving of
fullgrown arms which they effect actually gain more than they cost
and then mademoiselle do you not think there is something in the
presence of childhood thus mixed up with every laborsomething mild
pure almost sacred which has its influence on our words and actions
and imposes a salutary reserve The coarsest man will respect the
presence of children

The more one reflects the more one sees that everything here is really
designed for the happiness of all said Angela in admiration

It has not been done without trouble It was necessary to conquer
prejudices and break through customs But see Mdlle Angela here we
are at the kitchen added the smith smiling is it not as imposing as
that of a barrack or a public school

Indeed the culinary department of the Common Dwellinghouse was
immense All its utensils were bright and clean and thanks to the
marvellous and economical inventions of modern science which are always
beyond the reach of the poorer classes to whom they are most necessary
because they can only be practised on a large scale not only the fire
on the hearth and in the stoves was fed with half the quantity of
fuel that would have been consumed by each family individually but the
excess of the caloric sufficed with the aid of wellconstructed tubes
to spread a mild and equal warmth through all parts of the house And
here also children under the direction of two women rendered numerous
services Nothing could be more comic than the serious manner in which
they performed their culinary functions it was the same with the
assistance they gave in the bakehouse where at an extraordinary saving
in the price for they bought flour wholesale they made an excellent
household bread composed of pure wheat and rye so preferable to
that whiter bread which too often owes its apparent qualities to some
deleterious substance

Goodday Dame Bertrand said Agricola gayly to a worthy matron who
was gravely contemplating the slow evolution of several spits worthy
of Gamaches Wedding so heavily were they laden with pieces of beef
mutton and veal which began to assume a fine golden brown color of the
most attractive kind goodday Dame Bertrand According to the rule
I do not pass the threshold of the kitchen I only wish it to be admired
by this young lady who is a newcomer amongst us

Admire my lad pray admireand above all take notice how good these
brats are and how well they work So saying the matron pointed with
the long ladle which served her as a sceptre to some fifteen children
of both sexes seated round a table and deeply absorbed in the exercise
of their functions which consisted in peeling potatoes and picking
herbs

We are I see to have a downright Belshazzars feast Dame Bertrand
said Agricola laughing

Faith a feast like we have always my lad Here is our bill of fare
for today A good vegetable soup roast beef with potatoes salad
fruit cheese and for extras it being Sunday some currant tarts made
by Mother Denis at the bakehouse where the oven is heating now

What you tell me Dame Bertrand gives me a furious appetite said
Agricola gayly One soon knows when it is your turn in the kitchen
added he with a flattering air

Get along do said the female Soyer on service merrily

What astonishes me so much M Agricola said Angela as they
continued their walk is the comparison of the insufficient
unwholesome food of the workmen in our country with that which is
provided here

And yet we do not spend more than twentyfive sous a day for much
better food than we should get for three francs in Paris

But really it is hard to believe M Agricola How is it possible

It is thanks to the magic wand of M Hardy I will explain it all
presently

Oh how impatient I am to see M Hardy

You will soon see himperhaps today for he is expected every moment
But here is the refectory which you do not yet know as your family
like many others prefer dining at home See what a fine room looking
out on the garden just opposite the fountain

It was indeed a vast hall built in the form of a gallery with ten
windows opening on the garden Tables covered with shining oilcloth
were ranged along the walls so that in winter this apartment
served in the evening after work as a place of meeting for those who
preferred to pass an hour together instead of remaining alone or with
their families Then in this large hall well warmed and brilliantly
lighted with gas some read some played cards some talked and some
occupied themselves with easy work

That is not all said Agricola to the young girl I am sure you will
like this apartment still better when I tell you that on Thursdays
and Sundays we make a ballroom of it and on Tuesdays and Saturdays a
concertroom

Really

Yes continued the smith proudly we have amongst us musicians
quite capable of tempting us to dance Moreover twice a week nearly
all of us sing in chorusmen women and children Unfortunately this
week some disputes that have arisen in the factory have prevented our
concerts

So many voices that must be superb

It is very fine I assure you M Hardy has always encouraged this
amusement amongst us which has he saysand he is rightso powerful
an effect on the mind and the manners One winter he sent for two
pupils of the celebrated Wilhelm and since then our school has made
great progress I assure you Mdlle Angela that without flattering
ourselves there is something truly exciting in the sound of two hundred
voices singing in chorus some hymn to Labor or Freedom You shall hear
it and you will I think acknowledge that there is something great
and elevating in the heart of man in this fraternal harmony of voices
blending in one grave sonorous imposing sound

Oh I believe it But what happiness to inhabit here It is a life of
joy for labor mixed with recreation becomes itself a pleasure

Alas here as everywhere there are tears and sorrows replied
Agricola sadly Do you see that isolated building in a very exposed
situation

Yes what is it

That is our hospital for the sick Happily thanks to our healthy mode
of life it is not often full an annual subscription enables us to have
a good doctor Moreover a mutual benefit society is arranged in such a
manner amongst us that any one of us in case of illness receives two
thirds of what he would have gained in health

How well it is all managed And there M Agricola on the other side
of the grassplot

That is the washhouse with water laid on cold and hot and under
yonder shed is the dryingplace further on you see the stables and
the lofts and granaries for the provender of the factory horses

But M Agricola will you tell me the secret of all these wonders

In ten minutes you shall understand it all mademoiselle

Unfortunately Angelas curiosity was for a while disappointed The girl
was now standing with Agricola close to the iron gate which shut in the
garden from the broad avenue that separated the factory from the Common
Dwellinghouse Suddenly the wind brought from the distance the sound
of trumpets and military music then was heard the gallop of two
horses approaching rapidly and soon after a general officer made his
appearance mounted on a fine black charger with a long flowing tail
and crimson housings he wore cavalry boots and white breeches after
the fashion of the empire his uniform glittered with gold embroidery
the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor was passed over his right epaulet
with its four silver stars and his hat had a broad gold border and
was crowned with a white plume the distinctive sign reserved for
the marshals of France No warrior could have had a more martial and
chivalrous air or have sat more proudly on his warhorse At the moment
Marshal Simon for it was he arrived opposite the place where Angela
and Agricola were standing he drew up his horse suddenly sprang
lightly to the ground and threw the golden reins to a servant in
livery who followed also on horseback

Where shall I wait for your grace asked the groom

At the end of the avenue said the marshal

And uncovering his head respectfully he advanced hastily with his
hat in his hand to meet a person whom Angela and Agricola had not
previously perceived This person soon appeared at a turn of the avenue
he was an old man with an energetic intelligent countenance He wore
a very neat blouse and a cloth cap over his long white hair With his
hands in his pocket he was quietly smoking an old meerschaum pipe

Goodmorning father said the marshal respectfully as he
affectionately embraced the old workman who having tenderly returned
the pressure said to him Put on your hat my boy But how gay we
are added he with a smile

I have just been to a review father close by and I took the
opportunity to call on you as soon as possible

But shall I then not see my granddaughters today as I do every
Sunday

They are coming in a carriage father and Dagobert accompanies them

But what is the matter you appear full of thought

Indeed father said the marshal with a somewhat agitated air I
have serious things to talk about

Come in then said the old man with some anxiety The marshal and
his father disappeared at the turn of the avenue

Angela had been struck with amazement at seeing this brilliant General
who was entitled your grace salute an old workman in a blouse as his
father and looking at Agricola with a confused air she said to him
What M Agricola this old workman

Is the father of Marshal Duke de Lignythe friendyes I may say the
friend added Agricola with emotion of my father who for twenty
years served under him in war

To be placed so high and yet to be so respectful and tender to his
father said Angela The marshal must have a very noble heart but why
does he let his father remain a workman

Because Father Simon will not quit his trade and the factory for
anything in the world He was born a workman and he will die a workman
though he is the father of a duke and marshal of France

CHAPTER LI THE SECRET

When the very natural astonishment which the arrival of Marshal Simon
had caused in Angela had passed away Agricola said to her with a smile
I do not wish to take advantage of this circumstance Mdlle Angela
to spare you the account of the secret by which all the wonders of our
Common Dwellinghouse are brought to pass

Oh I should not have let you forget your promise M Agricola
answered Angela what you have already told me interests me too much
for that

Listen then M Hardy like a true magician has pronounced three
cabalistic words ASSOCIATIONCOMMUNITYFRATERNITY We have understood
the sense of these words and the wonders you have seen have sprung from
them to our great advantage and also I repeat to the great advantage
of M Hardy

It is that which appears so extraordinary M Agricola

Suppose mademoiselle that M Hardy instead of being what he is had
only been a coldhearted speculator looking merely to the profit and
saying to himself To make the most of my factory what is needed
Good workgreat economy in the raw materialfull employment of the
workmans time in a word cheapness of manufacture in order to produce
cheaplyexcellence of the thing produced in order to sell dear

Truly M Agricola no manufacturer could desire more

Well mademoiselle these conditions might have been fulfilled as they
have been but how Had M Hardy only been a speculator he might have
said At a distance from my factory my workmen might have trouble to
get there rising earlier they will sleep less it is a bad economy
to take from the sleep so necessary to those who toil When they get
feeble the work suffers for it then the inclemency of the seasons
makes it worse the workman arrives wet trembling with cold enervated
before he begins to workand then what work

It is unfortunately but too true M Agricola At Lille when I reached
the factory wet through with a cold rain I used sometimes to shiver
all day long at my work

Therefore Mdlle Angela the speculator might say To lodge
my workmen close to the door of my factory would obviate this
inconvenience Let us make the calculation In Paris the married workman
pays about two hundred and fifty francs ayear30 for one or two
wretched rooms and a closet dark small unhealthy in a narrow
miserable street there he lives pellmell with his family What ruined
constitutions are the consequence and what sort of work can you expect
from a feverish and diseased creature As for the single men they pay
for a smaller and quite as unwholesome lodging about one hundred and
fifty francs ayear Now let us make the addition I employ one hundred
and fortysix married workmen who pay together for their wretched
holes thirtysix thousand five hundred francs I employ also one
hundred and fifteen bachelors who pay at the rate of seventeen thousand
two hundred and eighty francs the total will amount to about fifty
thousand francs per annum the interest on a million

Dear me M Agricola what a sum to be produced by uniting all these
little rents together

You see mademoiselle that fifty thousand francs ayear is a
millionaires rent Now what says our speculator To induce our workmen
to leave Paris I will offer them enormous advantages I will reduce
their rent onehalf and instead of small unwholesome rooms they
shall have large airy apartments wellwarmed and lighted at a
trifling charge Thus one hundred and fortysix families paying me
only one hundred and twentyfive francs ayear and one hundred
and fifteen bachelors seventyfive francs I shall have a total of
twentysix to twentyseven thousand francs Now a building large enough
to hold all these people would cost me at most five hundred thousand
francs31 I shall then have invested my money at five per cent at the
least and with perfect security since the wages is a guarantee for the
payment of the rent

Ah M Agricola I begin to understand how it may sometimes be
advantageous to do good even in a pecuniary sense

And I am almost certain mademoiselle that in the long run affairs
conducted with uprightness and honesty turn out well But to return to
our speculator Here will he say are my workmen living close to
my factory well lodged well warmed and arriving always fresh at
their work That is not all the English workman who eats good beef and
drinks good beer does twice as much in the same time as the French
workman32 reduced to a detestable kind of food rather weakening than
the reverse thanks to the poisonous adulteration of the articles he
consumes My workmen will then labor much better if they eat much
better How shall I manage it without loss Now I think of it what
is the food in barracks schools even prisons Is it not the union of
individual resources which procures an amount of comfort impossible to
realize without such an association Now if my two hundred and sixty
workmen instead of cooking two hundred and sixty detestable dinners
were to unite to prepare one good dinner for all of them which might
be done thanks to the savings of all sorts that would ensue what an
advantage for me and them Two or three women aided by children would
suffice to make ready the daily repasts instead of buying wood and
charcoal in fractions33 and so paying for it double its value the
association of my workmen would upon my security their wages would be
an efficient security for me in return lay in their own stock of wood
flour butter oil wine etc all which they would procure directly
from the producers Thus they would pay three or four sous for a bottle
of pure wholesome wine instead of paying twelve or fifteen sous for
poison Every week the association would buy a whole ox and some sheep
and the women would make bread as in the country Finally with these
resources and order and economy my workmen may have wholesome
agreeable and sufficient food for from twenty to twentyfive sous a
day

Ah this explains it M Agricola

It is not all mademoiselle Our coolheaded speculator would continue
Here are my workmen well lodged well warmed well fed with a saving
of at least half why should they not also be warmly clad Their health
will then have every chance of being good and health is labor The
association will buy wholesale and at the manufacturing price still
upon my security secured to me by their wages warm good strong
materials which a portion of the workmens wives will be able to make
into clothes as well as any tailor Finally the consumption of caps and
shoes being considerable the association will obtain them at a great
reduction in price Well Mdlle Angela what do you say to our
speculator

I say M Agricola answered the young girl with ingenuous
admiration that it is almost incredible and yet so simple

No doubt nothing is more simple than the good and beautiful and yet
we think of it so seldom Observe that our man has only been speaking
with a view to his own interestonly considering the material side of
the questionreckoning for nothing the habit of fraternity and mutual
aid which inevitably springs from living together in commonnot
reflecting that a better mode of life improves and softens the character
of mannot thinking of the support and instruction which the strong owe
to the weaknot acknowledging in fine that the honest active and
industrious man has a positive right to demand employment from
society and wages proportionate to the wants of his condition No
our speculator only thinks of the gross profits and yet you see he
invests his money in buildings at five per cent and finds the greatest
advantages in the material comfort of his workmen

It is true M Agricola

And what will you say mademoiselle when I prove to you that our
speculator finds also a great advantage in giving to his workmen in
addition to their regular wages a proportionate share of his profits

That appears to me more difficult to prove M Agricola

Yet I will convince you of it in a few minutes

Thus conversing Angela and Agricola had reached the gardengate of the
Common Dwellinghouse An elderly woman dressed plainly but with care
and neatness approached Agricola and asked him Has M Hardy returned
to the factory sir

No madame but we expect him hourly

Today perhaps

Today or tomorrow madame

You cannot tell me at what hour he will be here

I do not think it is known madame but the porter of the factory
who also belongs to M Hardys private house may perhaps be able to
inform you

I thank you sir

Quite welcome madame

M Agricola said Angela when the woman who had just questioned him
was gone did you remark that this lady was very pale and agitated

I noticed it as you did mademoiselle I thought I saw tears standing
in her eyes

Yes she seemed to have been crying Poor woman perhaps she came to
ask assistance of M Hardy But what ails you M Agricola You appear
quite pensive

Agricola had a vague presentiment that the visit of this elderly woman
with so sad a countenance had some connection with the adventure of the
young and pretty lady who three days before had come all agitated and
in tears to inquire after M Hardy and who had learnedperhaps too
latethat she was watched and followed

Forgive me mademoiselle said Agricola to Angela but the presence
of this old lady reminded me of a circumstance which unfortunately I
cannot tell you for it is a secret that does not belong to me alone

Oh do not trouble yourself M Agricola answered the young girl
with a smile I am not inquisitive and what we were talking of before
interests me so much that I do not wish to hear you speak of anything
else

Well then mademoiselle I will say a few words more and you will be
as well informed as I am of the secrets of our association

I am listening M Agricola

Let us still keep in view the speculator from mere interest Here are
my workmen says he in the best possible condition to do a great
deal of work Now what is to be done to obtain large profits Produce
cheaply and sell dear But there will be no cheapness without economy
in the use of the raw material perfection of the manufacturing process
and celerity of labor Now in spite of all my vigilance how am I to
prevent my workmen from wasting the materials How am I to induce them
each in his own province to seek for the most simple and least irksome
processes

True M Agricola how is that to be done

And that is not all says our man to sell my produce at high
prices it should be irreproachable excellent My workmen do pretty
well but that is not enough I want them to produce masterpieces

But M Agricola when they have once performed the task set them what
interest have workmen to give themselves a great deal of trouble to
produce masterpieces

There it is Mdlle Angela what interest have they Therefore our
speculator soon says to himself That my workmen may have an interest
to be economical in the use of the materials an interest to employ
their time well an interest to invent new and better manufacturing
processes an interest to send out of their hands nothing but
masterpiecesI must give them an interest in the profits earned by
their economy activity zeal and skill The better they manufacture
the better I shall sell and the larger will be their gain and mine
also

Oh now I understand M Agricola

And our speculator would make a good speculation Before he was
interested the workman said What does it matter to me that I do more
or do better in the course of the day What shall I gain by it Nothing
Well then little work for little wages But now on the contrary
he says I have an interest in displaying zeal and economy All is
changed I redouble my activity and strive to excel the others If a
comrade is lazy and likely to do harm to the factory I have the right
to say to him Mate we all suffer more or less from your laziness and
from the injury you are doing the common weal

And then M Agricola with what ardor courage and hope you must set
to work

That is what our speculator counts on and he may say to himself
further Treasures of experience and practical wisdom are often buried
in workshops for want of goodwill opportunity or encouragement
Excellent workmen instead of making all the improvements in their
power follow with indifference the old jogtrot What a pity for an
intelligent man occupied all his life with some special employment
must discover in the long run a thousand ways of doing his work better
and quicker I will form therefore a sort of consulting committee I
will summon to it my foremen and my most skillful workmen Our interest
is now the same Light will necessarily spring from this centre of
practical intelligence Now the speculator is not deceived in this
and soon struck with the incredible resources the thousand new
ingenious perfect inventions suddenly revealed by his workmen Why
he exclaims if you knew this did you not tell it before What for the
last ten years has cost me a hundred francs to make would have cost
me only fifty without reckoning an enormous saving of time Sir
answers the workman who is not more stupid than others what interest
had I that you should effect a saving of fifty per cent None But now
it is different You give me besides my wages a share in your
profits you raise me in my own esteem by consulting my experience and
knowledge Instead of treating me as an inferior being you enter into
communion with me It is my interest it is my duty to tell you all I
know and to try to acquire more And thus it is Mdlle Angela
that the speculator can organize his establishment so as to shame
his oppositionists and provoke their envy Now if instead of a cold
hearted calculator we tape a man who unites with the knowledge of these
facts the tender and generous sympathies of an evangelical heart and
the elevation of a superior mind he will extend his ardent solicitude
not only to the material comfort but to the moral emancipation of
his workmen Seeking everywhere every possible means to develop their
intelligence to improve their hearts and strong in the authority
acquired by his beneficence feeling that he on whom depends the
happiness or the misery of three hundred human creatures has also the
care of souls he will be the guide of those whom he no longer calls his
workmen but his brothers in a straightforward and noble path and will
try to create in them the taste for knowledge and art which will render
them happy and proud of a condition of life that is often accepted by
others with tears and curses of despair Well Mdlle Angela such a man
isbut see he could not arrive amongst us except in the middle of a
blessing There he isthere is M Hardy

Oh M Agricola said Angela deeply moved and drying her tears we
should receive him with our hands clasped in gratitude

Look if that mild and noble countenance is not the image of his
admirable soul

A carriage with post horses in which was M Hardy with M de Blessac
the unworthy friend who was betraying him in so infamous a manner
entered at this moment the courtyard of the factory

A little while after a humble hackneycoach was seen advancing also
towards the factory from the direction of Paris In this coach was
Rodin

30 The average price of a workmans lodging composed of two small
rooms and a closet at most on the third or fourth story

31 This calculation is amply sufficient if not excessive A similar
building at one league from Paris on the side of Montrouge with all
the necessary offices kitchen washhouses etc with gas and water
laid on apparatus for warming etc and a garden of ten acres cost
at the period of this narrative hardly five hundred thousand francs
An experienced builder less obliged us with an estimate which confirms
what we advance It is therefore evident that even at the same
price which workmen are in the habit of paying it would be possible to
provide them with perfectly healthy lodgings and yet invest ones money
at ten per cent

32 The fact was proved in the works connected with the Rouen Railway
Those French workmen who having no families were able to live like the
English did at least as much work as the latter being strengthened by
wholesome and sufficient nourishment

33 Buying pennyworths like all other purchases at minute retail are
greatly to the poor mans disadvantage




CHAPTER LII REVELATIONS

During the visit of Angela and Agricola to the Common Dwellinghouse
the band of Wolves joined upon the road by many of the haunters
of taverns continued to march towards the factory which the
hackneycoach that brought Rodin from Paris was also fast approaching
M Hardy on getting out of the carriage with his friend M de Blessac
had entered the parlor of the house that he occupied next the factory
M Hardy was of middle size with an elegant and slight figure which
announced a nature essentially nervous and impressionable His forehead
was broad and open his complexion pale his eyes black full at once
of mildness and penetration his countenance honest intelligent and
attractive

One word will paint the character of M Hardy His mother had called him
her Sensitive Plant His was indeed one of those fine and exquisitely
delicate organizations which are trusting loving noble generous but
so susceptible that the least touch makes them shrink into themselves
If we join to this excessive sensibility a passionate love for art a
firstrate intellect tastes essentially refined and then think of the
thousand deceptions and numberless infamies of which M Hardy must have
been the victim in his career as a manufacturer we shall wonder how
this heart so delicate and tender had not been broken a thousand
times in its incessant struggle with merciless selfinterest M Hardy
had indeed suffered much Forced to follow the career of productive
industry to honor the engagements of his father a model of uprightness
and probity who had yet left his affairs somewhat embarrassed in
consequence of the events of 1815 he had succeeded by perseverance
and capacity in attaining one of the most honorable positions in the
commercial world But to arrive at this point what ignoble annoyances
had he to bear with what perfidious opposition to combat what hateful
rivalries to tire out

Sensitive as he was M Hardy would a thousand times have fallen a
victim to his emotions of painful indignation against baseness of
bitter disgust at dishonesty but for the wise and firm support of his
mother When he returned to her after a day of painful struggles
with odious deceptions he found himself suddenly transported into an
atmosphere of such beneficent purity of such radiant serenity that he
lost almost on the instant the remembrance of the base things by which
he had been so cruelly tortured during the day the pangs of his heart
were appeased at the mere contact of her great and lofty soul and
therefore his love for her resembled idolatry When he lost her he
experienced one of those calm deep sorrows which have no endwhich
become as it were part of life and have even sometimes their days
of melancholy sweetness A little while after this great misfortune M
Hardy became more closely connected with his workmen He had always been
a just and good master but although the place that his mother left
in his heart would ever remain void he felt as it were a redoubled
overflowing of the affections and the more he suffered the more he
craved to see happy faces around him The wonderful ameliorations which
he now produced in the physical and moral condition of all about him
served not to divert but to occupy his grief Little by little he
withdrew from the world and concentrated his life in three affections
a tender and devoted friendship which seemed to include all past
friendshipsa love ardent and sincere like a last passionand a
paternal attachment to his workmen His days therefore passed in the
heart of that little world so full of respect and gratitude towards
hima world which he had as it were created after the image of his
mind that he might find there a refuge from the painful realities he
dreaded surrounded with good intelligent happy beings capable
of responding to the noble thoughts which had become more and more
necessary to his existence Thus after many sorrows M Hardy arrived
at the maturity of age possessing a sincere friend a mistress worthy
of his love and knowing himself certain of the passionate devotion
of his workmen had attained at the period of this history all the
happiness he could hope for since his mothers death

M de Blessac his bosom friend had long been worthy of his touching
and fraternal affection but we have seen by what diabolical means
Father dAigrigny and Rodin had succeeded in making M de Blessac until
then upright and sincere the instrument of their machinations The two
friends who had felt on their journey a little of the sharp influence
of the north wind were warming themselves at a good fire lighted in M
Hardys parlor

Oh my dear Marcel I begin really to get old said M Hardy with a
smile addressing M de Blessac I feel more and more the want of being
at home To depart from my usual habits has become painful to me and I
execrate whatever obliges me to leave this happy little spot of ground

And when I think answered M de Blessac unable to forbear blushing
when I think my friend that you undertook this long journey only for
my sake

Well my dear Marcel have you not just accompanied me in your turn in
an excursion which without you would have been as tiresome as it has
been charming

What a difference my friend I have contracted towards you a debt that
I can never repay

Nonsense my dear Marcel Between us there are no distinctions of meum
and tuum Besides in matters of friendship it is as sweet to give as
to receive

Noble heart noble heart

Say happy heartmost happy in the last affections for which it
beats

And who gracious heaven could deserve happiness on earth if it be
not you my friend

And to what do I owe that happiness To the affections which I found
here ready to sustain me when deprived of the support of my mother
who was all my strength I felt myself I confess my weakness almost
incapable of standing up against adversity

You my friendwith so firm and resolute a character in doing
goodyou that I have seen struggle with so much energy and courage to
secure the triumph of some great and noble idea

Yes but the farther I advance in my career the more am I disgusted
with all base and shameful actions and the less strength I feel to
encounter them

Were it necessary you would have the courage my friend

My dear Marcel replied M Hardy with mild and restrained emotion
I have often said to you My courage was my mother You see my friend
when I went to her with my heart torn by some horrible ingratitude
or disgusted by some base deceit she taking my hands between her own
venerable palms would say to me in her grave and tender voice My dear
child it is for the ungrateful and dishonest to suffer let us pity the
wicked let us forget evil and only think of goodThen my friend
this heart painfully contracted expanded beneath the sacred influence
of the maternal words and every day I gathered strength from her to
recommence on the morrow a cruel struggle with the sad necessities of my
condition Happily it has pleased God that after losing that beloved
mother I have been able to bind up my life with affections deprived
of which I confess I should find myself feeble and disarmed for you
cannot tell Marcel the support the strength that I have found in your
friendship

Do not speak of me my dear friend replied M de Blessac dissembling
his embarrassment Let us talk of another affection almost as sweet
and tender as that of a mother

I understand you my good Marcel replied M Hardy I have concealed
nothing from you since under such serious circumstances I had recourse
to the counsels of your friendship Well yes I think that every day I
live augment my adoration for this woman the only one that I have ever
passionately loved the only one that I shall now ever love And then I
must tell you that my mother not knowing what Margaret was to me as
often loud in her praise and that circumstance renders this love almost
sacred in my eyes

And then there are such strange resemblances between Mme de Noisys
character and yours my friend above all in her worship of her
mother

It is true Marcel that affection has often caused me both admiration
and torment How often she has said to me with her habitual frankness
I have sacrificed all for you but I would sacrifice you for my
mother

Thank heaven my friend you will never see Mme de Noisy exposed to
that cruel choice Her mother you say has long renounced her intention
of returning to America where M de Noisy perfectly careless of
his wife appears to have settled himself permanently Thanks to the
discreet devotion of the excellent woman by whom Margaret was brought
up your love is concealed in the deepest mystery What could disturb it
now

Nothingoh nothing cried M Hardy I have almost security for its
duration

What do you mean my friend

I do not know if I ought to tell you

Have you ever found me indiscreet my friend

You good Marcel how can you suppose such a thing said M Hardy in
a tone of friendly reproach no but I do not like to tell you of my
happiness till it is complete and I am not yet quite certain

A servant entered at this moment and said to M Hardy Sir there is an
old gentleman who wishes to speak to you on very pressing business

So soon said M Hardy with a slight movement of impatience With
your permission my friend Then as M de Blessac seemed about to
withdraw into the next room M Hardy added with a smile No no do
not stir Your presence will shorten the interview

But if it be a matter of business my friend

I do everything openly as you know Then addressing the servant M
Hardy bade him Ask the gentleman to walk in

The postilion wishes to know if he is to wait

Certainly he will take M de Blessac back to Paris

The servant withdrew and presently returned introducing Rodin with
whom M de Blessac was not acquainted his treacherous bargain having
been negotiated through another agent

M Hardy said Rodin bowing respectfully to the two friends and
looking from one to the other with an air of inquiry

That is my name sir what can I do to serve you answered the
manufacturer kindly for at first sight of the humble and illdressed
old man he expected an application for assistance

M Francois Hardy repeated Rodin as if he wished to make sure of the
identity of the person

I have had the honor to tell you that I am he

I have a private communication to make to you sir said Rodin

You may speak sir This gentleman is my friend said M Hardy
pointing to M de Blessac

But I wish to speak to you alone sir resumed Rodin

M de Blessac was again about to withdraw when M Hardy retained him
with a glance and said to Rodin kindly for he thought his feelings
might be hurt by asking a favor in presence of a third party Permit
me to inquire if it is on your account or on mine that you wish this
interview to be secret

On your account entirely sir answered Rodin

Then sir said M Hardy with some surprise you may speak out I
have no secrets from this gentleman

After a moments silence Rodin resumed addressing himself to M Hardy
Sir you deserve I know all the good that is said of you and you
therefore command the sympathy of every honest man

I hope so sir

Now as an honest man I come to render you a service

And this service sir

To reveal to you an infamous piece of treachery of which you have been
the victim

I think sir you must be deceived

I have the proofs of what I assert

Proofs

The written proofs of the treachery that I come to reveal I have them
here answered Rodin In a word a man whom you believed your friend
has shamefully deceived you sir

And the name of this man

M Marcel de Blessac replied Rodin

On these words M de Blessac started and became pale as death He
could hardly murmur Sir

But without looking at his friend or perceiving his agitation M
Hardy seized his hand and exclaimed hastily Silence my friend
Then whilst his eye flashed with indignation he turned towards Rodin
who had not ceased to look him full in the face and said to him with
an air of lofty disdain What do you accuse M de Blessac

Yes I accuse him replied Rodin briefly

Do you know him

I have never seen him

Of what do you accuse him And how dare you say that he has betrayed
me

Two words if you please said Rodin with an emotion which he
appeared hardly able to restrain If one man of honor sees another
about to be slain by an assassin ought he not give the alarm of
murder

Yes sir but what has that to do

In my eyes sir certain treasons are as criminal as murders I have
come to place myself between the assassin and his victim

The assassin the victim said M Hardy more and more astonished

You doubtless know M de Blessacs writing said Rodin

Yes sir

Then read this said Rodin drawing from his pocket a letter which he
handed to M Hardy

Casting now for the first time a glance at M de Blessac the
manufacturer drew back a step terrified at the deathlike paleness of
this man who struck dumb with shame could not find a word to justify
himself for he was far from possessing the audacious effrontery
necessary to carry him through his treachery

Marcel cried M Hardy in alarm and deeply agitated by this
unexpected blow Marcel how pale you are you do not answer

Marcel this then is M de Blessac cried Rodin feigning the most
painful surprise Oh sir if I had known

But dont you hear this man Marcel cried M Hardy He says that you
have betrayed me infamously He seized the hand of M de Blessac That
hand was cold as ice Oh God Oh God said M Hardy drawing back in
horror he makes no answer

Since I am in presence of M de Blessac resumed Rodin I am forced
to ask him if he can deny having addressed many letters to the Rue du
Milieu des Ursins at Paris under cover of M Rodin

M de Blessac remained dumb M Hardy still unwilling to believe what
he saw and heard convulsively tore open the letter which Rodin had
just delivered to him and read the first few linesinterrupting the
perusal with exclamations of grief and amazement He did not require to
finish the letter to convince himself of the black treachery of M de
Blessac He staggered for a moment his senses seemed to abandon him
The horrible discovery made him giddy and his head swam on his first
look down into that abyss of infamy The loathsome letter dropped from
his trembling hands But soon indignation rage and scorn succeeded
this moment of despair and rushing pale and terrible upon M de
Blessac Wretch he exclaimed with a threatening gesture But
pausing as in the act to strike No he added with fearful calmness
It would be to soil my hands

He turned towards Rodin who had approached hastily as if to interpose
It is not worth while chastising a wretch said M Hardy But I will
press your honest hand sirfor you have had the courage to unmask a
traitor and a coward

Sir cried M de Blessac overcome with shame I am at your
ordersand

He could not finish The sound of voices was heard behind the door
which opened violently and an aged woman entered in spite of the
efforts of the servant exclaiming in an agitated voice I tell you I
must speak instantly to your master

On hearing this voice and at sight of the pale weeping woman M
Hardy forgetting M de Blessac Rodin the infamous treachery and all
fell back a step and exclaimed Madame Duparc you here What is the
matter

Oh sir a great misfortune

Margaret cried M Hardy in a tone of despair

She is gone sir

Gone repeated M Hardy as horrorstruck as if a thunderbolt had
fallen at his feet Margaret gone

All is discovered Her mother took her awaythree days ago said the
unhappy woman in a failing voice

Gone Margaret It is not true You deceive me cried M Hardy
Refusing to hear more wild despairing he rushed out of the house
threw himself into his carriage to which the posthorses were still
harnessed waiting for M de Blessac and said to the postilion To
Paris as fast as you can go

As the carriage rapid as lightning started upon the road to Paris the
wind brought nearer the distant sound of the warsong of the Wolves
who were rushing towards the factory In this impending destruction see
Rodins subtle hand administering his fatal blows to clear his way up
to the chair of St Peter to which he aspired His tireless wily course
can hardly be darker shadowed by aught save that dread coming horror
the Cholera whose aid he evoked and whose health the Bacchanal Queen
wildly drank

That once gay girl and her poor famished sister the fair patrician and
her Oriental lover Agricola the workman and his veteran father the
smiling RosePompon and the prematurely withered Jacques Rennepont
Father dAigrigny the mock priest and Gabriel the true disciple
with the rest that have been named and others yet to be pictured in the
blaze of the bolts of their lifes paths will be seen in the third and
concluding part of this romance entitled

PART THIRDTHE REDEMPTION




CHAPTER I THE WANDERING JEWS CHASTISEMENT

Tis nightthe moon is brightly shining the brilliant stars are
sparkling in a sky of melancholy calmness the shrill whistlings of a
northerly windcold bleak and evilbearingare increasing winding
about and bursting into violent blasts with their harsh and hissing
gusts they are sweeping the heights of Montmartre A man is standing
on the very summit of the hill his lengthened shadow thrown out by
the moons pale beams darkens the rocky ground in the distance The
traveller is surveying the huge city lying at his feetthe City of
Parisfrom whose profundities are cast up its towers cupolas domes
and steeples in the bluish moisture of the horizon while from the very
centre of this sea of stones is rising a luminous vapor reddening the
starry azure of the sky above It is the distant light of a myriad
lamps which at night the season for pleasure is illuminating the noisy
capital

No said the traveller it will not be The Lord surely will not
suffer it Twice is quite enough Five centuries ago the avenging hand
of the Almighty drove me hither from the depths of Asia A solitary
wanderer I left in my track more mourning despair disaster and
death than the innumerable armies of a hundred devastating conquerors
could have produced I then entered this city and it was decimated Two
centuries ago that inexorable hand which led me through the world again
conducted me here and on that occasion as on the previous one that
scourge which at intervals the Almighty binds to my footsteps ravaged
this city attacking first my brethren already wearied by wretchedness
and toil My brethren through methe laborer of Jerusalem cursed by
the Lord who in my person cursed the race of laborersa race always
suffering always disinherited always slaves who like me go on on
on without rest or intermission without recompense or hope until at
length women men children and old men die under their iron yoke of
selfmurder that others in their turn then take up borne from age to
age on their willing but aching shoulders And here again for the third
time in the course of five centuries I have arrived at the summit of
one of the hills which overlooks the city and perhaps I bring
again with me terror desolation and death And this unhappy city
intoxicated in a whirl of joys and nocturnal revelries knows nothing
about itoh it knows not that I am at its very gate But no no my
presence will not be a source of fresh calamity to it The Lord in
His unsearchable wisdom has brought me hither across France making me
avoid on my route all but the humblest villages so that no increase
of the funeral knell has marked my journey And then moreover the
spectre has left methat spectre livid and green with its deep
bloodshot eyes When I touched the soil of France its moist and icy
hand abandoned mineit disappeared And yet I feel the atmosphere of
death surrounding me still There is no cessation the biting gusts
of this sinister wind which envelop me in their breath seem by their
envenomed breath to propagate the scourge Doubtless the anger of the
Lord is appeased Maybe my presence here is meant only as a threat
intending to bring those to their senses whom it ought to intimidate It
must be so for were it otherwise it would on the contrary strike a
loudsounding blow of greater terror casting at once dread and death
into the very heart of the country into the bosom of this immense city
Oh no no the Lord will have mercy He will not condemn me to this new
affliction Alas in this city my brethren are more numerous and more
wretched than in any other And must I bring death to them No the Lord
will have mercy for alas the seven descendants of my sister are at
last all united in this city And must I bring death to them Death
instead of that immediate assistance they stand so much in need of For
that woman who like myself wanders from one end of the world into the
other has gone now on her everlasting journey after having confounded
their enemies plots In vain did she foretell that great evils still
threatened those who are akin to me through my sisters blood The
unseen hand by which I am led drives that woman away from me even as
though it were a whirlwind that swept her on In vain she entreated and
implored at the moment she was leaving those who are so dear to meAt
least 0 Lord permit me to stay until I shall have finished my task
Onward A few days for mercys sake only a few days Onward I leave
these whom I am protecting on the very brink of an abyss Onward
Onward And the wandering star is launched afresh on its perpetual
course But her voice traversed through space calling me to the
assistance of my own When her voice reached me I felt that the
offspring of my sister were still exposed to fearful dangers those
dangers are still increasing Oh say say Lord shall the descendants
of my sister escape those woes which for so many centuries have
oppressed my race Wilt Thou pardon me in them Wilt Thou punish me
in them Oh lead them that they may obey the last wishes of their
ancestor Guide them that they may join their charitable hearts their
powerful strength their best wisdom and their immense wealth and work
together for the future happiness of mankind thereby perhaps enabled
to ransom me from my eternal penalties Let those divine words of
the Son of Man Love ye one another be their only aim and by the
assistance of their allpowerful words let them contend against and
vanquish those false priests who have trampled on the precepts of love
of peace and hope commanded by the Saviour setting up in their stead
the precepts of hatred violence and despair Those false shepherds
supported ay the powerful and wealthy of the world who in all times
have been their accomplices instead of asking here below a little
happiness for my brethren who have been suffering and groaning for
centuries dare to utter in Thy name O Lord that the poor must always
be doomed to the tortures of this world and that it is criminal in
Thine eyes that they should either wish for or hope a mitigation of
their sufferings on earth because the happiness of the few and the
wretchedness of nearly all mankind is Thine almighty will Blasphemies
is it not the contrary of these homicidal words that is more worthy of
the name of Divine will Hear me O Lord for mercys sake Snatch from
their enemies the descendants of my sister from the artisan up to
the kings son Do not permit them to crush the germ of a mighty and
fruitful association which perhaps under Thy protection may take its
place among the records of the happiness of mankind Suffer me O Lord
to unite those whom they are endeavoring to divideto defend those whom
they are attacking Suffer me to bring hope to those from whom hope has
fled to give courage to those who are weak to uphold those whom evil
threatens and to sustain those who would persevere in welldoing And
then perhaps their struggles their devotedness their virtues this
miseries might expiate my sin Yes minemisfortune misfortune alone
made me unjust and wicked O Lord since Thine almighty hand hath
brought me hither for some end unknown to me disarm Thyself I implore
Thee of Thine anger and let not me be the instrument of Thy vengeance
There is enough of mourning in the earth these two years pastThy
creatures have fallen by millions in my footsteps The world is
decimated A veil of mourning extends from one end of the globe to the
other I have traveled from Asia even to the Frozen Pole and death has
followed in my wake Dost Thou not hear O Lord the universal wailings
that mount up to Thee Have mercy upon all and upon me One day grant
me but a single day that I may collect the descendants of my sister
together and save them And uttering these words the wanderer fell
upon his knees and raised his hands to heaven in a suppliant attitude

Suddenly the wind howled with redoubled violence its sharp whistlings
changed to a tempest The Wanderer trembled and exclaimed in a voice of
terror O Lord the blast of death is howling in its rage It appears
as though a whirlwind were lifting me up Lord wilt Thou not then
hear my prayer The spectre O do I behold the spectre Yes there it
is its cadaverous countenance is agitated by convulsive throes its red
eyes are rolling in their orbits Begone begone Oh its handits icy
hand has seized on mine Mercy Lord have mercy Onward Oh Lord
this scourge this terrible avenging scourge Must I then again carry
it into this city must my poor wretched brethren be the first to fall
under itthough already so miserable Mercy mercy Onward And the
descendants of my sisteroh pray have mercy mercy Onward O Lord
have pity on me I can no longer keep my footing on the ground the
spectre is dragging me over the brow of the hill my course is as rapid
as the deathbearing wind that whistles in my track I already approach
the walls of the city Oh mercy Lord mercy on the descendants of my
sisterspare them do not compel me to be their executioner and let
them triumph over their enemies Onward onward The ground is fleeing
from under me I am already at the city gate oh yet Lord yet there
is time oh have mercy on this slumbering city that it may not even
now awaken with the lamentations of terror of despair and death O
Lord I touch the threshold of the gate verily Thou willest it so
then Tis doneParis the scourge is in thy bosom oh cursed cursed
evermore am I Onward on on34

34 In 1346 the celebrated Black Death ravaged the earth presenting
the same symptoms as the cholera and the same inexplicable phenomena as
to its progress and the results in its route In 1660 a similar epidemic
decimated the world It is well known that when the cholera first broke
out in Paris it had taken a wide and unaccountable leap and also
memorable a northeast wind prevailed during its utmost fierceness




CHAPTER II THE DESCENDANTS OF THE WANDERING JEW

That lonely wayfarer whom we have heard so plaintively urging to be
relieved of his gigantic burden of misery spoke of his sisters
descendants being of all ranks from the working man to the kings son
They were seven in number who had in the year 1832 been led to Paris
directly or indirectly by a bronze medal which distinguished them from
others bearing these wordsVICTIM of L C D J Pray for me

PARIS February the 13th 1682

IN PARIS Rue St Francois No 3 In a century and a half you will be
February the 13th 1832

 PRAY FOR ME

The son of the King of Mundi had lost his father and his domains in
India by the irresistible march of the English and was but in title
Prince Djalma Spite of attempts to make his departure from the East
delayed until after the period when he could have obeyed his
medals command he had reached France by the second month of 1832
Nevertheless the results of shipwreck had detained him from Paris till
after that date A second possessor of this token had remained unaware
of its existence only discovered by accident But an enemy who sought
to thwart the union of these seven members had shut her up in a
madhouse from which she was released only after that day Not alone
was she in imprisonment An old Bonapartist General Simon Marshal of
France and Duke de Ligny had left a wife in Russian exile while he
unable to follow Napoleon to St Helena continued to fight the English
in India by means of Prince Djalmas Sepoys whom he drilled On the
latters defeat he had meant to accompany his young friend to Europe
induced the more by finding that the latters mother a Frenchwoman had
left him such another bronze medal as he knew his wife to have had

Unhappily his wife had perished in Siberia without his knowing it any
more than he did that she had left twin daughters Rose and Blanche
Fortunately for them one who had served their father in the Grenadiers
of the Guard Francis Baudoin nicknamed Dagobert undertook to fulfil
the dying mothers wishes inspired by the medal Saving a check at
Leipsic where one Morok the liontamers panther had escaped from its
cage and killed Dagoberts horse and a subsequent imprisonment which
the Wandering Jews succoring hand had terminated the soldier and his
orphan charges had reached Paris in safety and in time But there a
renewal of the foes attempt had gained its end By skillful devices
Dagobert and his son Agricola were drawn out of the way while Rose and
Blanche Simon were decoyed into a nunnery under the eyes of Dagoberts
wife But she had been bound against interfering by the influence of the
Jesuit confessional The fourth was M Hardy a manufacturer and the
fifth Jacques Rennepont a drunken scamp of a workman who were more
easily fended off the latter in a sponging house the former by
a friends lure Adrienne de Cardoville daughter of the Count of
Rennepont who had also been Duke of Cardoville was the lady who had
been unwarrantably placed in the lunatic asylum The fifth unaware
of the medal was Gabriel a youth who had been brought up though
a foundling in Dagoberts family as a brother to Agricola He had
entered holy orders and more was a Jesuit in name though not in
heart Unlike the others his return from abroad had been smoothed He
had signed away all his future prospects for the benefit of the order
of Loyola and moreover executed a more complete deed of transfer on
the day the 13th of February 1832 when he alone of the heirs stood
in the room of the house No 3 Rue St Francois claiming what was a
vast surprise for the Jesuits who a hundred and fifty years
before had discovered that Count Marius de Rennepont had secreted a
considerable amount of his wealth all of which had been confiscated to
them in those painful days of dragoonings and the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes They had bargained for some thirty or forty millions of
francs to be theirs by educating Gabriel into resigning his inheritance
to them but it was two hundred and twelve millions which the Jesuit
representatives Father dAigrigny and his secretary Rodin were amazed
to hear their nursling placed in possession of They had the treasure
in their hands in fact when a woman of strangely sad beauty had
mysteriously entered the room where the will had been read and laid
a paper before the notary It was a codicil duly drawn up and signed
deferring the carrying out of the testament until the first day of June
the same year The Jesuits fled from the house in rage and intense
disappointment Father dAigrigny was so stuporstricken at the defeat
that he bade his secretary at once write off to Rome that the Rennepont
inheritance had escaped them and hopes to seize it again were utterly
at an end Upon this Rodin had revolted and shown that he had
authority to command where he had so far most humbly obeyed Many such
spies hang about their superiors heels with full powers to become the
governor in turn at a moments notice Thenceforward he Rodin had
taken the business into his own hands He had let Rose and Blanche Simon
out of the convent into their fathers arms He had gone in person to
release Adrienne de Cardoville from the asylum More having led her to
sigh for Prince Djalma he prompted the latter to burn for her

He let not M Hardy escape A friend whom the latter treated as a
brother had been shown up to him as a mere spy of the Jesuits the
woman whom he adored a wedded woman alas who had loved him in spite
of her vows had been betrayed Her mother had compelled her to hide her
shame in America and as she had often saidMuch as you are endeared
to me I cannot waver between you and my mother so she had obeyed
without one farewell word to him Confess Rodin was a more dextrous
man than his late master In the pages that ensue farther proofs of his
superiority in baseness and satanic heartlessness will not be wanting




CHAPTER III THE ATTACK

On M Hardys learning from the confidential gobetween of the lovers
that his mistress had been taken away by her mother he turned from
Rodin and dashed away in a post carriage At the same moment as loud
as the rattle of the wheels there arose the shouts of a band of workmen
and rioters hired by the Jesuits emissaries coming to attack Hardys
operatives An old grudge long existing between them and a rival
manufacturersBaron Tripeaudlaborers fanned the flames When M
Hardy had left the factory Rodin who was not prepared for this
sudden departure returned slowly to his hackneycoach but he stopped
suddenly and started with pleasure and surprise when he saw at some
distance Marshall Simon and his father advancing towards one of the
wings of the Common Dwellinghouse for an accidental circumstance had
so far delayed the interview of the father and son

Very well said Rodin Better and better Now only let my man have
found out and persuaded little RosePompon

And Rodin hastened towards his hackneycoach At this moment the wind
which continued to rise brought to the ear of the Jesuit the war song
of the approaching Wolves

The workman was in the garden The marshal said to him in a voice of
such deep emotion that the old man started Father I am very unhappy

A painful expression until then concealed suddenly darkened the
countenance of the marshal

You unhappy cried father Simon anxiously as he pressed nearer to
the marshal

For some days my daughters have appeared constrained in manner and
lost in thought During the first moments of our reunion they were
mad with joy and happiness Suddenly all has changed they are becoming
more and more sad Yesterday I detected tears in their eyes then
deeply moved I clasped them in my arms and implored them to tell me
the cause of their sorrow Without answering they threw themselves on
my neck and covered my face with their tears

It is strange To what do you attribute this alteration

Sometimes I think I have not sufficiently concealed from them the
grief occasioned me by the loss of their mother and they are
perhaps miserable that they do not suffice for my happiness And yet
inexplicable as it is they seem not only to understand but to share
my sorrow Yesterday Blanche said to me How much happier still should
we be if our mother were with us

Sharing your sorrow they cannot reproach you with it There must be
some other cause for their grief

Yes said the marshal looking fixedly at his father yesbut to
penetrate this secretit would be necessary not to leave them

What do you mean

First learn father what are the duties which would keep me here then
you shall know those which may take me away from you from my daughters
and from my other child

What other child

The son of my old friend the Indian Prince

Djalma Is there anything the matter with him

Father he frightens me I told you father of his mad and unhappy
passion for Mdlle de Cardoville

Does that frighten you my son said the old man looking at the
marshal with surprise Djalma is only eighteen and at that age one
love drives away another

You have no idea of the ravages which the passion has already made in
the ardent indomitable boy sometimes fits of savage ferocity follow
the most painful dejection Yesterday I came suddenly upon him his
eyes were bloodshot his features contracted with rage yielding to an
impulse of mad furry he was piercing with his poinard a cushion of red
cloth whilst he exclaimed panting for breath Ha bloodI will have
blood Unhappy boy I said to him what means this insane passion
Im killing the man replied he in a hollow and savage voice it is
thus he designates his supposed rival

There is indeed something terrible said the old man in such a
passion in such a heart

At other times resumed the marshal it is against Mdlle de
Cardoville that his rage bursts forth and at others against himself
I have been obliged to remove his weapons for a man who came with him
from Java and who appears much attached to him has informed me that he
suspected him of entertaining some thoughts of suicide

Unfortunate boy

Well father said Marshal Simon with profound bitterness it is
at the moment when my daughters and my adopted son require all my
solicitude that I am perhaps on the eve of quitting them

Of quitting them

Yes to fulfil a still more sacred duty than that imposed by friendship
or family said the marshal in so grave and solemn a tone that his
father exclaimed with deep emotion What can this duty be

Father said the marshal after remaining a moment in thoughtful
silence who made me what I am Who gave me the ducal title and the
marshals baton

Napoleon

For you the stern republican I know that he lost all his value when
from the first citizen of a Republic he became an emperor

I cursed his weakness said Father Simon sadly the demigod sank
into a man

But for me fatherfor me the soldier who have always fought beside
him or under his eyefor me whom he raised from the lowest rank in
the army to the highestfor me whom he loaded with benefits and marks
of affectionfor me he was more than a hero he was a friendand
there was as much gratitude as admiration in my idolatry for him When
he was exiled I would fain have shared his exile they refused me that
favor then I conspired then I drew my sword against those who had
robbed his son of the crown which France had given him

And in your position you did well Pierre without sharing your
admiration I understood your gratitude The projects of exile the
conspiraciesI approved them allyou know it

Well then that disinherited child in whose name I conspired
seventeen years ago is now of an age to wield his fathers sword

Napoleon II exclaimed the old man looking at his son with surprise
and extreme anxiety the king of Rome

King no he is no longer king Napoleon no he is no longer Napoleon
They have given him some Austrian name because the other frightened
them Everything frightens them Do you know what they are doing with
the son of the Emperor resumed the marshal with painful excitement
They are torturing himkilling him by inches

Who told you this

Somebody who knows whose words are but too true Yes the son of the
Emperor struggles with all his strength against a premature death With
his eyes turned towards France he waitshe waitsand no one comesno
oneout of all the men that his father made as great as they once were
little not one thinks of that crowned child whom they are stifling
till he dies

But you think of him

Yes but I had first to learnoh there is no doubt of it for I have
not derived all my information from the same sourceI had first to
learn the cruel fate of this youth to whom I also swore allegiance for
one day as I have told you the Emperor proud and loving father as he
was showed him to me in his cradle and said My old friend you will
be to the son what you have been to the father who loves us loves our
France

Yes I know it Many times you have repeated those words to me and
like yourself I have been moved by them

Well father suppose informed of the sufferings of the son of
the Emperor I had seenwith the positive certainty that I was not
deceiveda letter from a person of high rank in the court of Vienna
offering to a man that was still faithful to the Emperors memory the
means of communicating with the king of Rome and perhaps of saving him
from his tormentors

What next said the workman looking fixedly at his son Suppose
Napoleon II once at liberty

What next exclaimed the marshal Then he added in a suppressed
voice Do you think father that France is insensible to the
humiliations she endures Do you think that the memory of the Emperor
is extinct No no it is above all in the days of our countrys
degredation that she whispers that sacred name How would it be then
were that name to rise glorious on the frontier reviving in his son Do
you not think that the heart of all France would beat for him

This implies a conspiracyagainst the present governmentwith
Napoleon II for a watchword said the workman This is very serious

I told you father that I was very unhappy judge if it be not so
cried the marshal Not only I ask myself if I ought to abandon my
children and you to run the risk of so daring an enterprise but I
ask myself if I am not bound to the present government which in
acknowledging my rank and title if it bestowed no favor at least did
me an act of justice How shall I decideabandon all that I love or
remain insensible to the tortures of Emperorof that Emperor to the
son of the whom I owe everythingto whom I have sworn fidelity both
to himself and child Shall I lose this only opportunity perhaps of
saving him or shall I conspire in his favor Tell me if I exaggerate
what I owe to the memory of the Emperor Decide for me father During a
whole sleepless night I strove to discover in the midst of this chaos
the line prescribed by honor but I only wandered from indecision to
indecision You alone fatheryou alone I repeat can direct me

After remaining for some moments in deep thought the old man was about
to answer when some person running across the little garden opened
the door hastily and entered the room in which were the marshal and his
father It was Olivier the young workman who had been able to effect
his escape from the village in which the Wolves had assembled

M Simon M Simon cried he pale and panting for breath They are
hereclose at hand They have come to attack the factory

Who cried the old man rising hastily

The Wolves quarrymen and stonecutters joined on the road by a crowd
of people from the neighborhood and vagabonds from town Do you not
hear them They are shouting Death to the Devourers

The clamor was indeed approaching and grew more and more distinct

It is the same noise that I heard just now said the marshal rising
in his turn

There are more than two hundred of them M Simon said Olivier they
are armed with clubs and stones and unfortunately the greater part of
our workmen are in Paris We are not above forty here in all the women
and children are already flying to their chambers screaming for terror
Do you not hear them

The ceiling shook beneath the tread of many hasty feet

Will this attack be a serious one said the marshal to his father who
appeared more and more dejected

Very serious said the old man there is nothing more fierce than
these combats between different unions and everything has been done
lately to excite the people of the neighborhood against the factory

If you are so inferior in number said the marshal you must begin by
barricading all the doorsand then

He was unable to conclude A burst of ferocious cries shook the windows
of the room and seemed so near and loud that the marshal his father
and the young workman rushed out into the little garden which was
bounded on one side by a wall that separated it from the fields
Suddenly whilst the shouts redoubled in violence a shower of large
stones intended to break the windows of the house smashed some of the
panes on the first story struck against the wall and fell into the
garden all around the marshal and his father By a fatal chance one
of these large stones struck the old man on the head He staggered bent
forward and fell bleeding into the arms of Marshal Simon just as arose
from without with increased fury the savage cries of Death to the
Devourers




CHAPTER IV THE WOLVES AND THE DEVOURERS

It was a frightful thing to view the approach of the lawless crowd
whose first act of hostility had been so fatal to Marshal Simons
father One wing of the Common Dwellinghouse which joined the
gardenwall on that side was next to the fields It was there that the
Wolves began their attack The precipitation of their march the halt
they had made at two publichouses on the road their ardent impatience
for the approaching struggle had inflamed these men to a high pitch of
savage excitement Having discharged their first shower of stones most
of the assailants stooped down to look for more ammunition Some of
them to do so with greater ease held their bludgeons between their
teeth others had placed them against the wall here and there groups
had formed tumultuously round the principal leaders of the band the
most neatly dressed of these men wore frocks with caps whilst
others were almost in rags for as we have already said many of the
hangerson at the barriers and people without any profession had
joined the troop of the Wolves whether welcome or not Some hideous
women with tattered garments who always seem to follow in the track of
such people accompanied them on this occasion and by their cries and
fury inflamed still more the general excitement One of them tall
robust with purple complexion blood shot eyes and toothless jaws
had a handkerchief over her head from beneath which escaped her yellow
frowsy hair Over her ragged gown she wore an old plaid shawl crossed
over her bosom and tied behind her back This hag seemed possessed
with a demon She had tucked up her halftorn sleeves in one hand
she brandished a stick in the other she grasped a huge stone her
companions called her Ciboule scullion

This horrible hag exclaimed in a hoarse voice Ill bite the women of
the factory Ill make them bleed

The ferocious words were received with applause by her companions and
with savage cries of Ciboule forever which excited her to frenzy

Amongst the other leaders was a small dry pale man with the face of
a ferret and a black beard all round the chin he wore a scarlet Greek
cap and beneath his long blouse perfectly new appeared a pair of neat
cloth trousers strapped over thin boots This man was evidently of a
different condition of life from that of the other persons in the troop
it was he in particular who ascribed the most irritating and insulting
language to the workmen of the factory with regard to the inhabitants
of the neighborhood He howled a great deal but he carried neither
stick nor stone A fullfaced freshcolored man with a formidable bass
voice like a choristers asked him Will you not have a shot at those
impious dogs who might bring down the Cholera on the country as the
curate told us

I will have a better shot than you said the little man with a
singular sinister smile

And with what Id like to see

Probably with this said the little man stooping to pick up a
large stone but as he bent a wellfilled though light bag which he
appeared to carry under his blouse fell to the ground

Look you are losing both bag and baggage said the other it does
not seem very heavy

They are samples of wool answered the man with the ferrets face as
he hastily picked up the bag and replaced it under his blouse then he
added Attention the big blaster is going to speak

And in fact he who exercised the most complete ascendency over this
irritated crowd was the terrible quarryman His gigantic form towered
so much above the multitude that his great head bound in its ragged
handkerchief and his Herculean shoulders covered with a fallow goat
skin were always visible above the level of that dark and swarming
crowd only relieved here and there by a few womens caps like so many
white points Seeing to what a degree of exasperation the minds of the
crowd had reached the small number of honest but misguided workmen
who had allowed themselves to be drawn into this dangerous enterprise
under the pretext of a quarrel between rival unions now fearing for the
consequences of the struggle tried but too late to abandon the main
body Pressed close and as it were girt in with the more hostile
groups dreading to pass for cowards or to expose themselves to the bad
treatment of the majority they were forced to wait for a more
favorable moment to effect their escape To the savage cheers which
had accompanied the first discharge of stones succeeded a deep silence
commanded by the stentorian voice of the quarryman

The Wolves have howled he exclaimed let us wait and see how the
Devourers will answer and when they will begin the fight

We must draw them out of their factory and fight them on neutral
ground said the little man with the ferrets face who appeared to be
the thieves advocate otherwise there would be trespass

What do we care about trespass cried the horrible hag Ciboule in
or out I will tear the chits of the factory

Yes yes cried other hideous creatures as ragged as Ciboule herself
we must not leave all to the men

We must have our fun too

The women of the factory say that all the women of the neighborhood are
drunken drabs cried the little man with the ferrets face

Good well pay them for it

The women shall have their share

Thats our business

They like to sing in their Common House cried Ciboule we will make
them sing the wrong side of their mouths in the key of Oh dear me

This pleasantry was received with shouts hootings and furious stamping
of feet to which the stentorian voice of the quarryman put a term by
roaring Silence

Silence silence repeated the crowd Hear the blaster

If the Devourers are cowards enough not to dare to show themselves
after a second volley of stones there is a door down there which we can
break open and we will soon hunt them from their holes

It would be better to draw them out so that none might remain in the
factory said the little old man with the ferrets face who appeared
to have some secret motive

A man fights where he can cried the quarryman in a voice of thunder
all right if we can but once catch hold We could fight on a sloping
roof or on the top of a wallcouldnt we my Wolves

Yes yes cried the crowd still more excited by those savage words
if they dont come out we will break in

We will see their fine palace

The pagans havent even a chapel said the bass voice The curate has
damned them all

Why should they have a palace and we nothing but dogkennels

Hardys workmen say that kennels are good enough for such as you said
the little man with the ferrets face

Yes yes they said so

Well break all their traps

Well pull down their bazaar

Well throw the house out of the windows

When we have made the mealymouthed chits sing cried Ciboule we
will make them dance to the clatter of stones on their heads

Come my Wolves attention cried the quarryman still in the same
stentorian voice one more volley and if the Devourers do not come
out down with the door

This proposition was received with cheers of savage ardor and the
quarryman whose voice rose above the tumult cried with all the
strength of his herculean lungs Attention my Wolves Make ready all
together Now are you ready

Yes yesall ready

Then presentfire And for the second time a shower of enormous
stones poured upon that side of the Common Dwellinghouse which was
turned towards the fields A part of these projectiles broke such of the
windows as had been spared by the first volley To the sharp smashing
and cracking of glass were joined the ferocious cries uttered in chorus
by this formidable mob drunk with its own excesses Death to the
Devourers

Soon these outcries became perfectly frantic when through the broken
windows the assailants perceived women running in terror some with
children in their arms and others raising their hands to heaven
calling aloud for help whilst a few bolder than the rest leaned out
of the windows and tried to fasten the outside blinds

There come the ants out of their holes cried Ciboule stooping to
pick up a stone We must have a fling at them for luck The stone
hurled by the steady masculine hand of the virago went straight to its
mark and struck an unfortunate woman who was trying to close one of the
shutters

Hit in the white cried the hideous creature

Well done Cibouleyouve rapped her cokernut cried a voice

Ciboule forever

Come out you Devourers if you dare

They have said a hundred times that the neighbors were too cowardly
even to come and look at their house squealed the little man with the
ferrets face

And now they show the white feather

If they will not come out cried the quarryman in voice of thunder
let us smoke them out

Yes yes

Lets break open the door

We are sure to find them

Come on come on

The crowd with the quarryman at their head and Ciboule not far from
him brandishing a stick advanced tumultously towards one of the great
doors The ground shook beneath the rapid tread of the mob which had
now ceased shouting but the confused and as it were subterraneous
noise sounded even more ominous than those savage outcries The Wolves
soon arrived opposite the massive oaken door At the moment the blaster
raised a sledgehammer the door opened suddenly Some of the most
determined of the assailants were about to rush in at this entrance but
the quarryman stepped back extending his arm as if to moderate their
ardor and impose silence Then his followers gathered round him

The halfopen door discovered a party of workmen unfortunately by no
means numerous but with countenances full of resolution They had armed
themselves hastily with forks iron bars and clubs Agricola who was
their leader held in his hand a heavy sledgehammer The young workman
was very pale but the fire of his eye his menacing look and the
intrepid assurance of his bearing showed that his fathers blood
boiled in his veins and that in such a struggle he might become
fearinspiring Yet he succeeded in restraining himself and challenged
the quarryman in a firm voice What do you want

A fight thundered the blaster

Yes yes a fight repeated the crowd

Silence my Wolves cried the quarryman as he turned round and
stretched forth his large hand towards the multitude Then addressing
Agricola he said The Wolves have come to ask for a fight

With whom

With the Devourers

There are no Devourers here replied Agricola we are only peaceable
workmen So begone

Well here are the Wolves that will eat your quiet workmen

The Wolves will eat no one here said Agricola looking full at the
quarryman who approached him with a threatening air they can only
frighten little children

Oh you think so said the quarryman with a savage sneer Then
raising his weapon he shook it in Agricolas face exclaiming Is that
any laughing matter

Is that answered Agricola with a rapid movement parrying the stone
sledge with his own hammer

Iron against ironhammer against hammerthat suits me said the
quarryman

It does not matter what suits you answered Agricola hardly able to
restrain himself You have broken our windows frightened our women
and woundedperhaps killedthe oldest workman in the factory who at
this moment lies bleeding in the arms of his son Here Agricolas voice
trembled in spite of himself It is I think enough

No the Wolves are hungry for more answered the blaster you must
come out cowards that you are and fight us on the plain

Yes yes battlelet them come out cried the crowd howling
hissing waving their sticks and pushing further into the small space
which separated them from the door

We will have no battle answered Agricola we will not leave our
home but if you have the misfortune to pass this said Agricola
throwing his cap upon the threshold and setting his foot on it with an
intrepid air if you pass this you attack us in our own house and you
will be answerable for all that may happen

There or elsewhere we will have the fight the Wolves must eat the
Devourers Now for the attack cried the fierce quarryman raising his
hammer to strike Agricola

But the latter throwing himself on one side by a sudden leap avoided
the blow and struck with his hammer full at the chest of the quarryman
who staggered for a moment but instantly recovering his legs rushed
furiously on Agricola crying Follow me Wolves




CHAPTER V THE RETURN

As soon as the combat had begun between Agricola and the blaster
the general fight became terrible ardent implacable A flood of
assailants following the quarrymans steps rushed into the house
with irresistible fury others unable to force their way through this
dreadful crowd where the more impetuous squeezed stifled and crushed
these who were less so went round in another direction broke through
some lattice work and thus placed the people of the factory as it
were between two fires Some resisted courageously others seeing
Ciboule followed by some of her horrible companions and by several
of the most illlooking ruffians hastily enter that part of the
CommonDwelling house in which the women had taken refuge hurried in
pursuit of this band but some of the hags companions having faced
about and vigorously defended the entrance of the staircase against the
workmen Ciboule with three or four like herself and about the same
number of no less ignoble men rushed through the rooms with the
intention of robbing or destroying all that came in their way A door
which at first resisted their efforts was soon broken through
Ciboule rushed into the apartment with a stick in her hand her hair
dishevelled furious and as it were maddened with the noise and
tumult A beautiful young girl it was Angela who appeared anxious
to defend the entrance to a second chamber threw herself on her knees
pale and supplicating and raising her clasped hands exclaimed Do not
hurt my mother

Ill serve you out first and your mother afterwards replied the
horrible woman throwing herself on the poor girl and endeavoring to
tear her face with her nails whilst the rest of the ruffianly
band broke the glass and the clock with their sticks and possessed
themselves of some articles of wearing apparel

Angela struggling with Ciboule uttered loud cries of distress and
still attempted to guard the room in which her mother had taken refuge
whilst the latter leaning from the window called Agricola to their
assistance The smith was now engaged with the huge blaster In a close
struggle their hammers had become useless and with bloodshot eyes
and clinched teeth chest to chest and limbs twined together like two
serpents they made the most violent efforts to overthrow each other
Agricola bent forward held under his right arm the left leg of the
quarryman which he had seized in parrying a violent kick but such was
the Herculean strength of the leader of the Wolves that he remained
firm as a tower though resting only on one leg With the hand that
was still free for the other was gripped by Agricola as in a vise
he endeavored with violent blows to break the jaws of the smith who
leaning his head forward pressed his forehead hard against the breast
of his adversary

The Wolf will break the Devourers teeth and he shall devour no more
said the quarryman

You are no true Wolf answered the smith redoubling his efforts the
true Wolves are honest fellows and do not come ten against one

True or false I will break your teeth

And I your paw said the smith giving so violent a wrench to the leg
of the quarryman that the latter uttered a cry of acute pain and
with the rage of a wild beast butting suddenly forward with his head
succeeded in biting Agricola in the side of the neck

The pang of this bite forced Agricola to make a movement which enabled
the quarryman to disengage his leg Then with a superhuman effort he
threw himself with his whole weight on Agricola and brought him to the
ground falling himself upon him

At this juncture Angelas mother leaning from one of the windows of
the Common Dwellinghouse exclaimed in a heartrending voice Help
Agricolathey are killing my child

Let me goand on my honorI will fight you tomorrow or when you
will said Agricola panting for breath

No warmedup food for me I eat all hot answered the quarryman
seizing the smith by the throat whilst he tried to place one of his
knees upon his chest

Helpthey are killing my child cried Angelas mother in a voice of
despair

Mercy I ask mercy Let me go said Agricola making the most violent
efforts to escape

I am too hungry answered the quarryman

Exasperated by the terror which Angelas danger occasioned him Agricola
redoubled his efforts when the quarryman suddenly felt his thigh seized
by the sharp teeth of a dog and at the same instant received from a
vigorous hand three or four heavy blows with a stick upon his head He
relaxed his grasp and fell stunned upon his hand and knee whilst he
mechanically raised his other arm to parry the blows which ceased as
soon as Agricola was delivered

Father you have saved me cried the smith springing up If only I
am in time to rescue Angela

Runnever mind me answered Dagobert and Agricola rushed into the
house

Dogabert accompanied by Spoilsport had come as we have already said
to bring Marshal Simons daughters to their grandfather Arriving in the
midst of the tumult the soldier had collected a few workmen to defend
the entrance of the chamber to which the marshals father had been
carried in a dying state It was from this post that the soldier had
seen Agricolas danger Soon after the rush of the conflict separated
Dagobert from the quarryman who remained for some moments insensible
Arrived in two bounds at the Common Dwellinghouse Agricola succeeded
in forcing his way through the men who defended the staircase and
rushed into the corridor that led to Angelas chamber At the moment he
reached it the unfortunate girl was mechanically guarding her face with
both hands against Ciboule who furious as the hyena over its prey was
trying to scratch and disfigure her

To spring upon the horrible hag seize her by her yellow hair with
irresistible hand drag her backwards and then with one cuff stretch
her full length upon the ground was for Agricola an achievement
as rapid as thought Furious with rage Ciboule rose again almost
instantly but at this moment several workmen who had followed close
upon Agricola were able to attack with advantage and whilst the smith
lifted the fainting form of Angela and carried her into the next room
Ciboule and her band were driven from that part of the house

After the first fire of the assault the small number of real Wolves
who as Agricola said were in the main honest fellows but had the
weakness to let themselves be drawn into this enterprise under the
pretext of a quarrel between rival unions seeing the excesses committed
by the rabble who accompanied them turned suddenly round and ranged
themselves on the side of the Devourers

There are no longer here either Wolves or Devourers said one of
the most determined Wolves to Olivier with whom he had been fighting
roughly and fairly there are none here but honest workmen who must
unite to drive out a set of scoundrels that have come only to break and
pillage

Yes added another it was against our will that they began by
breaking your windows

The big blaster did it all said another the true Wolves wash their
hands of him We shall soon settle his account

We may fight every daybut we ought to esteem each other35

This defection of a portion of the assailants unfortunately but a
small portion gave new spirit to the workmen of the factory and all
together Wolves and Devourers though very inferior in number
opposed themselves to the band of vagabonds who were proceeding to new
excesses Some of these wretches still further excited by the little
man with the ferrets face a secret emissary of Baron Tripeaud
now rushed in a mass towards the workshops of M Hardy Then began
a lamentable devastation These people seized with the mania of
destruction broke without remorse machines of the greatest value and
most delicate construction half manufactured articles were pitilessly
destroyed a savage emulation seemed to inspire these barbarians
and those workshops so lately the model of order and wellregulated
economy were soon nothing but a wreck the courts were strewed with
fragments of all kinds of wares which were thrown from the windows with
ferocious outcries or savage bursts of laughter Then still thanks to
the incitements of the little man with the ferrets face the books
of M Hardy archives of commercial industry so indispensable to the
trader were scattered to the wind torn trampled under foot in a sort
of infernal dance composed of all that was most impure in this assembly
of low filthy and ragged men and women who held each other by the
hand and whirled round and round with horrible clamor Strange and
painful contrasts At the height of the stunning noise of these horrid
deeds of tumult and devastation a scene of imposing and mournful calm
was taking place in the chamber of Marshal Simons father the door of
which was guarded by a few devoted men The old workman was stretched
on his bed with a bandage across his blood stained white hair His
countenance was livid his breathing oppressed his look fixed and
glazed

Marshal Simon standing at the head of the bed bending over his father
watched in despairing anguish the least sign of consciousness on the
part of the dying man near whom was a physician with his finger on
the failing pulse Rose and Blanche brought hither by Dagobert were
kneeling beside the bed their hands clasped and their eyes bathed in
tears a little further half hidden in the shadows of the room for
the hours had passed quickly and the night was at hand stood Dagobert
himself with his arms crossed upon his breast and his features
painfully contracted A profound and solemn silence reigned in this
chamber only interrupted by the broken sobs of Rose and Blanche or by
Father Simons hard breathing The eyes of the marshal were dry gloomy
and full of fire He only withdrew them from his fathers face to
interrogate the physician by a look There are strange coincidences in
life That physician was Dr Baleinier The asylum of the doctor being
close to the barrier that was nearest to the factory and his fame being
widely spread in the neighborhood they had run to fetch him on the
first call for medical assistance

Suddenly Dr Baleinier made a movement the marshal who had not taken
his eyes off him exclaimed Is there any hope

At least my lord duke the pulse revives a little

He is saved said the marshal

Do not cherish false hopes my lord duke answered the doctor
gravely the pulse revives owing to the powerful applications to the
feet but I know not what will be the issue of the crisis

Father father do you hear me cried the marshal seeing the old man
slightly move his head and feebly raise his eyelids He soon opened his
eyes and this time their intelligence had returned

Father you liveyou know me cried the marshal giddy with joy and
hope

Pierre are you there said the old man in a weak voice Your
handgiveit and he made a feeble movement

Here father cried the marshal as he pressed the hands of the old
man in his own

Then yielding to an impulse of delight he bent over his father
covered his hands face and hair with kisses and repeated He lives
kind heaven he lives he is saved

At this instant the noise of the struggle which had recommenced between
the rabble the Wolves and the Devourers reached the ears of the dying
man

That noise that noise said he they are fighting

It is growing less I think said the marshal in order not to agitate
his father

Pierre said the old man in a weak and broken voice I have not long
to live

Father

Let me speak child if I can but tell you all

Sir said Baleinier piously to the old workman heaven may perhaps
work a miracle in your favor show yourself grateful and allow a
priest

A priest Thank you sirI have my son said the old man in his
arms I will render up my soulwhich has always been true and honest

You die exclaimed the marshal no no

Pierre said the old man in a voice which firm at first gradually
grew fainter just nowyou ask my advice in a very serious matter I
think that the wish to tell you of your dutyhas recalled mefor a
momentto lifefor I should die miserableif I thought you in a road
unworthy of yourself and me Listen to me my sonmy noble sonat this
last hour a father cannot deceive himself You have a great duty to
performunder painof not acting like a man of honorunder pain of
neglecting my last will You ought without hesitation

Here the voice failed the old man When he had pronounced the last
sentence he became quite unintelligible The only words that Marshal
Simon could distinguish were these Napoleon IIoathdishonormy
son

Then the old workman again moved his lips mechanicallyand all was
over At the moment he expired the night was quite come and terrible
shouts were heard from without of Fire Fire The conflagration had
broken out in one of the workshops filled with inflammable stuff into
which had glided the little man with the ferrets face At the same
time the roll of drums was heard in the distance announcing the
arrival of a detachment of troops from town

During an hour in spite of every effort the fire had been spreading
through the factory The night is clear cold starlight the wind blows
keenly from the north with a moaning sound A man walking across the
fields where the rising ground conceals the fire from him advances
with slow and unsteady steps It is M Hardy He had chosen to return
home on foot across the country hoping that a walk would calm the
fever in his bloodan icy fever more like the chill of death He had
not been deceived His adored mistressthe noble woman with whom he
might have found refuge from the consequences of the fearful deception
which had just been revealed to himhad quitted France He could have
no doubt of it Margaret was gone to America Her mother had exacted
from her in expiation of her fault that she should not even write to
him one word of farewellto him for whom she had sacrificed her duty
as a wife Margaret had obeyed

Besides she had often said to him Between my mother and you I should
not hesitate

She had not hesitated There was therefore no hope not the slightest
even if an ocean had not separated him from Margaret he knew enough
of her blind submission to her mother to be certain that all relations
between them were broken off forever It is well He will no longer
reckon upon this hearthis last refuge The two roots of his life have
been torn up and broken with the same blow the same day almost at the
same moment What then remains for thee poor sensitive plant as thy
tender mother used to call thee What remains to console thee for the
loss of this last lovethis last friendship so infamously crushed Oh
there remains for thee that one corner of the earth created after
the image of thy mind that little colony so peaceful and flourishing
where thanks to thee labor brings with it joy and recompense These
worthy artisans whom thou hast made happy good and grateful will
not fail thee That also is a great and holy affection let it be thy
shelter in the midst of this frightful wreck of all thy most sacred
convictions The calm of that cheerful and pleasant retreat the sight
of the unequalled happiness of thy dependents will soothe thy poor
suffering soul which now seems to live only for suffering Come you
will soon reach the top of the hill from which you can see afar in the
plain below that paradise of workmen of which you are the presiding
divinity

M Hardy had reached the summit of the hill At that moment the
conflagration repressed for a short time burst forth with redoubled
fury from the Common Dwellinghouse which it had now reached A bright
streak at first white then red then coppercolored illuminated
the distant horizon M Hardy looked at it with a sort of incredulous
almost idiotic stupor Suddenly an immense column of flame shot up in
the thick of a cloud of smoke accompanied by a shower of sparks and
streamed towards the sky casting a bright reflection over all the
country even to M Hardys feet The violence of the north wind
driving the flames in waves before it soon brought to the ears of M
Hardy the hurried clanging of the alarmbell of the burning factory

35 We wish it to be understood that the necessities of our story
alone have made the Wolves the assailants While endeavoring to paint
the evils arising the abuse of the spirit of association we do not wish
to ascribe a character of savage hostility to one sect rather than to
the other to the Wolves more than to the Devourers The Wolves a club
of united stonecutters are generally industrious intelligent workmen
whose situation is the more worthy of interest as not only their
labors conducted with mathematical precision are of the rudest and
most wearisome kind but they are likewise out of work during three or
four months of the year their profession being unfortunately one of
those which winter condemns to a forced cessation A number of Wolves
in order to perfect themselves in their trade attend every evening a
course of linear geometry applied to the cutting of stone analogous
to that given by M Agricole Perdignier for the benefit of carpenters
Several working stonecutters sent an architectural model in plaster to
the last exhibition




CHAPTER VI THE GOBETWEEN

A few days have elapsed since the conflagration of M Hardys factory
The following scene takes place in the Rue Clovis in the house where
Rodin had lodged and which was still inhabited by RosePompon who
without the least scruple availed herself of the household arrangements
of her friend Philemon It was about noon and RosePompon alone in
the chamber of the student who was still absent was breakfasting very
gayly by the fireside but how singular a breakfast what a queer fire
how strange an apartment

Imagine a large room lighted by two windows without curtainsfor as
they looked on empty space the lodger had fear of being overlooked
One side of this apartment served as a wardrobe for there was suspended
RosePompons flashy costume of debardeur not far from the boatmans
jacket of Philemon with his large trousers of coarse gray stuff
covered with pitch shiver my timbers just as if this intrepid
mariner had bunked in the forecastle of a frigate during a voyage
round the globe A gown of Rose Pompons hung gracefully over a pair of
pantaloons the legs of which seemed to come from beneath the petticoat
On the lowest of several bookshelves very dusty and neglected by the
side of three old boots wherefore three boots and a number of empty
bottles stood a skull a scientific and friendly souvenir left to
Philemon by one of his comrades a medical student With a species of
pleasantry very much to the taste of the studentworld a clay pipe
with a very black bowl was placed between the magnificently white teeth
of this skull moreover its shining top was half hidden beneath an
old hat set knowingly on one side and adorned with faded flowers
and ribbons When Philemon was drunk he used to contemplate this bony
emblem of mortality and break out into the most poetical monologues
with regard to this philosophical contrast between death and the mad
pleasures of life Two or three plaster casts with their noses and
chins more or less injured were fastened to the wall and bore witness
to the temporary curiosity which Philemon had felt with regard to
phrenological science from the patient and serious study of which he
had drawn the following logical conclusionThat having to an alarming
extent the bump of getting into debt he ought to resign himself to the
fatality of this organization and accept the inconvenience of creditors
as a vital necessity On the chimneypiece stood uninjured in all
its majesty the magnificent rowingclub drinkingglass a china teapot
without a spout and an inkstand of black wood the glass mouth of which
was covered by a coat of greenish and mossy mould From time to time
the silence of this retreat was interrupted by the cooing of pigeons
which RosePompon had established with cordial hospitality in the little
study Chilly as a quail RosePompon crept close to the fire and at
the same time seemed to enjoy the warmth of a bright ray of sunshine
which enveloped her in its golden light This droll little creature was
dressed in the oddest costume which however displayed to advantage
the freshness of her piquant and pretty countenance crowned with its
fine fair hair always neatly combed and arranged the first thing in
the morning By way of dressinggown RosePompon had ingeniously
drawn over her linen the ample scarlet flannel shirt which belonged to
Philemons official garb in the rowingclub the collar open and turned
down displayed the whiteness of the young girls under garment as
also of her neck and shoulders on whose firm and polished surface the
scarlet shirt seemed to cast a rosy light The grisettes fresh and
dimpled arms half protruded from the large turnedup sleeves and her
charming legs were also half visible crossed one over the other and
clothed in neat white stockings and boots A black silk cravat formed
the girdle which fastened the shirt round the wasplike waist of
RosePompon just above those hips worthy of the enthusiasm of a modern
Phidias and which gave to this style of dress a grace very original

We have said that the breakfast of RosePompon was singular You shall
judge On a little table placed before her was a washhandbasin into
which she had recently plunged her fresh face bathing it in pure water
From the bottom of this basin now transformed into a saladbowl Rose
Pompon took with the tips of her fingers large green leaves dripping
with vinegar and crunched them between her tiny white teeth whose
enamel was too hard to allow them to be set on edge Her drink was
a glass of water and syrup of gooseberries which she stirred with a
wooden mustardspoon Finally as an extra dish she had a dozen olives
in one of those blue glass trinketdishes sold for twentyfive sous Her
dessert was composed of nuts which she prepared to roast on a redhot
shovel That RosePompon with such an unaccountable savage choice of
food should retain a freshness of complexion worthy of her name is one
of those miracles which reveal the mighty power of youth and health
When she had eaten her salad RosePompon was about to begin upon her
olives when a low knock was heard at the door which was modestly
bolted on the inside

Who is there said RosePompon

A friendthe oldest of the old replied a sonorous jovial voice
Why do you lock yourself in

What is it you Ninny Moulin

Yes my beloved pupil Open quickly Time presses

Open to you Oh I dare saythat would be pretty the figure I am

I believe you what does it matter what figure you are It would be
very pretty thou rosiest of all the roses with which Cupid ever adorned
his quiver

Go and preach fasting and morality in your journal fat apostle
said RosePompon as she restored the scarlet shirt to its place with
Philemons other garments

I say are we to talk much longer through the door for the greater
edification of our neighbors cried Ninny Moulin I have something of
importance to tell yousomething that will astonish you

Give me time to put on my gown great plague that you are

If it is because of my modesty do not think of it I am not over nice
I should like you very well as you are

Only to think that such a monster is the favorite of all the
churchgoers said RosePompon opening the door as she finished
fastening her dress

So you have at last returned to the dovecot you stray girl said
Ninny Moulin folding his arms and looking at RosePompon with comic
seriousness And where may you have been I pray For three days the
naughty little bird has left its nest

True I only returned home last night You must have called during my
absence

I came every day and even twice a day young lady for I have very
serious matters to communicate

Very serious matters Then we shall have a good laugh at them

Not at allthey are really serious said Ninny Moulin seating
himself But first of all what did you do during the three days that
you left your conjugal and Philemonic home I must know all about it
before I tell you more

Will you have some olives said RosePompon as she nibbled one of
them herself

Is that your answerI understandUnfortunate Philemon

There is no unfortunate Philemon in the case slanderer Clara had a
death in her house and for the first few days after the funeral she
was afraid to sleep alone

I thought Clara sufficiently provided against such fears

There you are deceived you great viper I was obliged to go and keep
the poor girl company

At this assertion the religious pamphleteer hummed a tune with an
incredulous and mocking air

You think I have played Philemon tricks cried RosePompon cracking a
nut with the indignation of injured innocence

I do not say tricks but one little rosecolored trick

I tell you that it was not for my pleasure I went out On the
contraryfor during my absence poor Cephyse disappeared

Yes Mother Arsene told me that the BacchanalQueen was gone on a
journey But when I talk of Philemon you talk of Cephyse we dont
progress

May I be eaten by the black panther that they are showing at the Porte
SaintMartin if I do not tell you the truth And talking of that
you must get tickets to take me to see those animals my little Ninny
Moulin They tell me there never were such darling wild beasts

Now really are you mad

Why so

That I should guide your youth like a venerable patriarch through the
dangers of the Stormblown Tulip all well and goodI ran no risk
of meeting my pastors and masters but were I to take you to a Lent
Spectacle since there are only beasts to be seen I might just run
against my sacristansand how pretty I should look with you on my arm

You can put on a false nose and straps to your trousers my big Ninny
they will never know you

We must not think of false noses but of what I have to tell you since
you assure me that you have no intrigue in hand

I swear it said RosePompon solemnly extending her left hand
horizontally whilst with her right she put a nut into her mouth Then
she added with surprise as she looked at the outside coat of Ninny
Moulin Goodness gracious what full pockets you have got What is
there in them

Something that concerns you RosePompon said Dumoulin gravely

Me

RosePompon said Ninny Moulin suddenly with a majestic air will
you have a carriage Will you inhabit a charming apartment instead of
living in this dreadful hole Will you be dressed like a duchess

Now for some more nonsense Come will you eat the olives If not I
shall eat them all up There is only one left

Without answering this gastronomic offer Ninny Moulin felt in one of
his pockets and drew from it a case containing a very pretty bracelet
which he held up sparkling before the eyes of the young girl

Oh what a sumptuous bracelet cried she clapping her hands A
greeneyed serpent biting his tailthe emblem of my love for Philemon

Do not talk of Philemon it annoys me said Ninny Moulin as he
clasped the bracelet round the wrist of RosePompon who allowed him to
do it laughing all the while like mad and saying to him So youve
been employed to make a purchase big apostle and wish to see the
effect of it Well it is charming

RosePompon resumed Ninny Moulin would you like to have a servant
a box at the Opera and a thousand francs a month for your pinmoney

Always the same nonsense Get along said the young girl as she held
up the bracelet to the light still continuing to eat her nuts Why
always the same farce and no change of bills

Ninny Moulin again plunged his hand into his pocket and this time drew
forth an elegant chain which he hung round RosePompons neck

Oh what a beautiful chain cried the young girl as she looked by
turns at the sparkling ornament and the religious writer If you chose
that also you have a very good taste But am I not a good natured girl
to be your dummy just to show off your jewels

RosePompon returned Ninny Moulin with a still more majestic air
these trifles are nothing to what you may obtain if you will but
follow the advice of your old friend

Rose began to look at Dumoulin with surprise and said to him What
does all this mean Ninny Moulin Explain yourself what advice have you
to give

Dumoulin did not answer but replunging his hand into his inexhaustible
pocket he fished up a parcel which he carefully unfolded and in which
was a magnificent mantilla of black lace RosePompon started up full
of new admiration and Dumoulin threw the rich mantilla over the young
girls shoulders

It is superb I have never seen anything like it What patterns what
work said RosePompon as she examined all with simple and perfectly
disinterested curiosity Then she added Your pocket is like a shop
where did you get all these pretty things Then bursting into a fit of
laughter which brought the blood to her cheeks she exclaimed Oh I
have it These are the weddingpresents for Madame de la SainteColombe
I congratulate you they are very choice

And where do you suppose I should find money to buy these wonders
said Ninny Moulin I repeat to you all this is yours if you will but
listen to me

How is this said RosePompon with the utmost amazement is what you
tell me in downright earnest

In downright earnest

This offer to make me a great lady

The jewels might convince you of the reality of my offers

And you propose all this to me for some one else my poor Ninny
Moulin

One moment said the religious writer with a comical air of modesty
you must know me well enough my beloved pupil to feel certain that
I should be incapable of inducing you to commit an improper action I
respect myself too much for thatleaving out the consideration that it
would be unfair to Philemon who confided to me the guardianship of your
virtue

Then Ninny Moulin said RosePompon more and more astonished on my
word of honor I can make nothing of it

Yet tis all very simple and I

Oh Ive found it cried RosePompon interrupting Ninny Moulin it
is some gentleman who offers me his hand his heart and all the rest of
it Could you not tell me that directly

A marriage oh laws yes said Dumoulin shrugging his shoulders

What is it not a marriage said RosePompon again much surprised

No

And the offers you make me are honest ones my big apostle

They could not be more so Here Dumoulin spoke the truth

I shall not have to be unfaithful to Philemon

No

Or faithful to any one else

No

RosePompon looked confounded Then she rattled on Come do not let
us have any joking I am not foolish enough to imagine that I am to live
just like a duchess just for nothing What therefore must I give in
return

Nothing at all

Nothing

Not even that said Ninny Moulin biting his nailtip

But what am I to do then

Dress yourself as handsomely as possible take your ease amuse
yourself ride about in a carriage You see it is not very
fatiguingand you will moreover help to do a good action

What by living like a duchess

Yes so make up your mind Do not ask me for any more details for I
cannot give them to you For the rest you will not be detained against
your will Just try the life I propose to you If it suits you go on
with it if not return to your Philemonic household

In fact

Only try it What can you risk

Nothing but I can hardly believe that all you say is true And then
added she with hesitation I do not know if I ought

Ninny Moulin went to the window opened it and said to RosePompon who
ran up to it Look there before the door of the house

What a pretty carriage How comfortable a bodyd be inside of it

That carriage is yours It is waiting for you

Waiting for me exclaimed RosePompon am I to decide as short as
that

Or not at all

Today

On the instant

But where will they take me

How should I know

You do not know where they will take me

Not Iand Dumoulin still spoke the truththe coachman has his
orders

Do you know all this is very funny Ninny Moulin

I believe you If it were not funny where would be the pleasure

You are right

Then you accept the offer That is well I am delighted both for you
and myself

For yourself

Yes because in accepting you render me a great service

You How so

It matters little as long as I feel obliged to you

True

Come then let us set out

Bah after all they cannot eat me said RosePompon resolutely

With a skip and a jump she went to fetch a rosecolored cap and going
up to a broken lookingglass placed the cap very much cocked on one
side on her bands of light hair This left uncovered her snowy neck
with the silky roots of the hair behind and gave to her pretty face a
very mischievous not to say licentious expression

My cloak said she to Ninny Moulin who seemed to be relieved from a
considerable amount of uneasiness since she had accepted his offer

Fie a cloak will not do answered her companion feeling once more
in his pocket and drawing out a fine Cashmere shawl which he threw over
RosePompons shoulders

A Cashmere cried the young girl trembling with pleasure and joyous
surprise Then she added with an air of heroism It is settled I
will run the gauntlet And with a light step she descended the stairs
followed by Ninny Moulin

The worthy greengrocer was at her post Goodmorning mademoiselle you
are early today said she to the young girl

Yes Mother Arsene there is my key

Thank you mademoiselle

Oh now I think of it said Rose Pompon suddenly in a whisper as
she turned towards Ninny Moulin and withdrew further from the portress
what is to became of Philemon

Philemon

If he should arrive

Oh the devil said Ninny Moulin scratching his ear

Yes if Philemon should arrive what will they say to him for I may be
a long time absent

Three or four months I suppose

Not more

I should think not

Oh very good said RosePompon Then turning towards the
greengrocer she said to her after a moments reflection Mother
Arsene if Philemon should come home you will tell him I have gone
outon business

Yes mademoiselle

And that he must not forget to feed my pigeons which are in his
study

Yes mademoiselle

Goodbye Mother Arsene

Goodbye mademoiselle And RosePompon entered the carriage in
triumph along with Ninny Moulin

The devil take me if I know what is to come of all this said Jacques
Dumoulin to himself as the carriage drove rapidly down the Rue Clovis
I have repaired my errorand now I laugh at the rest




CHAPTER VII ANOTHER SECRET

The following scene took place a few days after the abduction of Rose
Pompon by Ninny Moulin Mdlle de Cardoville was seated in a dreamy
mood in her cabinet which was hung with green silk and furnished
with an ebony library ornamented with large bronze caryatides By some
significant signs one could perceive that Mdlle de Cardoville had
sought in the fine airs some relief from sad and serious thoughts
Near an open piano was a harp placed before a musicstand A little
further on a table covered with boxes of oil and watercolor were
several brilliant sketches Most of them represented Asiatic scenes
lighted by the fires of an oriental sun Faithful to her fancy of
dressing herself at home in a picturesque style Mademoiselle de
Cardoville resembled that day one of those proud portraits of Velasquez
with stern and noble aspect Her gown was of black moire with wide
swelling petticoat long waist and sleeve slashed with rosecolored
satin fastened together with jet bugles A very stiff Spanish ruff
reached almost to her chin and was secured round her neck by a broad
rosecolored ribbon This frill slightly heaving sloped down as far as
the graceful swell of the rosecolored stomacher laced with strings of
jet beads and terminating in a point at the waist It is impossible to
express how well this black garment with its ample and shining folds
relieved with rosecolor and brilliant jet skin harmonized with the
shining whiteness of Adriennes and the golden flood of her beautiful
hair whose long silky ringlets descended to her bosom

The young lady was in a halfrecumbent posture with her elbow resting
on a couch covered with green silk The back of this piece of furniture
which was pretty high towards the fireplace sloped down insensibly
towards the foot A sort of light semicircular trelliswork in gilded
bronze raised about five feet from the ground covered with flowering
plants the admirable passiflores quadrangulatoe planted in a deep
ebony box from the centre of which rose the trelliswork surrounded
this couch with a sort of screen of foliage enamelled with large
flowers green without purple within and as brilliant as those flowers
of porcelain which we receive from Saxony A sweet faint perfume
like a faint mixture of jasmine with violet rose from the cup of these
admirable passiflores Strange enough a large quantity of new books
Adrienne having bought them since the last two or three days and
quite freshcut were scattered around her on the couch and on a little
table whilst other larger volumes amongst which were several atlases
full of engravings were piled on the sumptuous fur which formed
the carpet beneath the divan Stranger still these books though of
different forms and by different authors alt treated of the same
subject The posture of Adrienne revealed a sort of melancholy
dejection Her cheeks were pale a light blue circle surrounded her
large black eyes now halfclosed and gave to them an expression of
profound grief Many causes contributed to this sorrowamongst others
the disappearance of Mother Bunch Without absolutely believing the
perfidious insinuations of Rodin who gave her to understand that in
the fear of being unmasked by him the hunchback had not dared to remain
in the house Adrienne felt a cruel sinking of the heart when she
thought how this young girl in whom she had had so much confidence had
fled from her almost sisterly hospitality without even uttering a word
of gratitude for care had been taken not to show her the few lines
written by the poor needlewoman to her benefactress just before her
departure

She had only been told of the note of five hundred francs found on her
desk and this last inexplicable circumstance had contributed to awaken
cruel suspicions in the breast of Mdlle de Cardoville She already felt
the fatal effects of that mistrust of everything and everybody which
Rodin had recommended to her and this sentiment of suspicion and
reserve had the more tendency to become powerful that for the first
time in her life Mdlle de Cardoville until then a stranger to all
deception had a secret to conceala secret which was equally her
happiness her shame and her torment Halfrecumbent on her divan
pensive and depressed Adrienne pursued with a mind often absent one
of her newly purchased books Suddenly she uttered an exclamation of
surprise the hand which held the book trembled like a leaf and from
that moment she appeared to read with passionate attention and devouring
curiosity Soon her eyes sparkled with enthusiasm her smile
assumed ineffable sweetness and she seemed at once proud happy
delightedbut as she turned over the last page her countenance
expressed disappointment and chagrin Then she recommenced this reading
which had occasioned her such sweet emotion and this time she read with
the most deliberate slowness going over each page twice and spelling
as it were every line every word From time to time she paused
and in a pensive mood with her forehead leaning on her fair hand she
seemed to reflect in a deep reverie on the passages she had read with
such tender and religious love Arriving at a passage which so affected
her that a tear started in her eye she suddenly turned the volume
to see on the cover the name of the author For a few seconds she
contemplated this name with a singular expression of gratitude and
could not forbear raising to her rosy lips the page on which it was
printed After reading many times over the lines with which she had
been so much struck forgetting no doubt the letter in the spirit she
began to reflect so deeply that the book glided from her hand and
fell upon the carpet During the course of this reverie the eyes of the
young girl rested at first mechanically upon an admirable basrelief
placed on an ebony stand near one of the windows This magnificent
bronze recently cast after a plaster copy from the antique represented
the triumph of the Indian Bacchus Never perhaps had Grecian art
attained such rare perfection The youthful conqueror half clad in a
lions skin which displayed his juvenile grace and charming purity
of form shone with divine beauty Standing up in a car drawn by two
tigers with an air at once gentle and proud he leaned with one hand
upon a thyrsus and with the other guided his savage steeds in tranquil
majesty By this rare mixture of grace vigor and serenity it was easy
to recognize the hero who had waged such desperate combats with men and
with monsters of the forest Thanks to the brownish tone of the figure
the light falling from one side of the sculpture admirably displayed
the form of the youthful god which carved in relievo and thus
illumined shone like a magnificent statue of pale gold upon the dark
fretted background of the bronze

When Adriennes look first rested on this rare assemblage of divine
perfections her countenance was calm and thoughtful But this
contemplation at first mechanical became gradually more and more
attentive and conscious and the young lady rising suddenly from her
seat slowly approached the basrelief as if yielding to the invincible
attraction of an extraordinary resemblance Then a slight blush appeared
on the cheeks of Mdlle de Cardoville stole across her face and spread
rapidly to her neck and forehead She approached still closer threw
round a hasty glance as if halfashamed or as if she had feared to
be surprised in a blamable action and twice stretched forth her hand
trembling with emotion to touch with the tips of her charming fingers
the bronze forehead of the Indian Bacchus And twice she stopped short
with a kind of modest hesitation At last the temptation became too
strong for her She yielded to it and her alabaster finger after
delicately caressing the features of pale gold was pressed more boldly
for an instant on the pure and noble brow of the youthful god At this
pressure though so slight Adrienne seemed to feel a sort of electric
shock she trembled in every limb her eyes languished and after
swimming for an instant in their humid and brilliant crystal were
raised halfclosed to heaven Then her head was thrown a little way
back her knees bent insensibly her rosy lips were half opened as if
to give a passage to her heated breath for her bosom heaved violently
as thought youth and life had accelerated the pulsations of her heart
and made her blood boil in her veins Finally the burning cheeks of
Adrienne betrayed a species of ecstasy timid and passionate chaste and
sensual the expression of which was ineffably touching

An affecting spectacle indeed is that of a young maiden whose modest
brow flushes with the first fires of a secret passion Does not the
Creator of all things animate the body as well as the soul with a
spark of divine energy Should He not be religiously glorified in the
intellect as in the senses with which He has so paternally endowed His
creatures They are impious blasphemers who seek to stifle the celestial
senses instead of guiding and harmonizing them in their divine flight
Suddenly Mdlle de Cardoville started raised her head opened her eyes
as if awakening from a dream withdrew abruptly from the sculptures
and walked several times up and down the room in an agitated manner
pressing her burning hands to her forehead Then falling as it were
exhausted on her seat her tears flowed in abundance The most bitter
grief was visible in her features which revealed the fatal struggle
that was passing within her By degrees her tears ceased To this
crisis of painful dejection succeeded a species of violent scorn and
indignation against herself which were expressed by these words that
escaped her For the first time in my life I feel weak and cowardly
Oh yes cowardlyvery cowardly

The sound of a door opening and closing roused Mdlle de Cardoville
from her bitter reflections Georgette entered the room and said to her
mistress Madame can you receive the Count de Montbron

Adrienne too wellbred to exhibit before her women the sort of
impatience occasioned by this unseasonable visit said to Georgette
You told M de Montbron that I was at home

Yes Madame

Then beg him to walk in Though Mdlle de Cardoville felt at that
moment much vexed at the arrival of Montbron let us hasten to say
that she entertained for him an almost filial affection and a profound
esteem though by a not unfrequent contrast she almost always differed
from him in opinion Hence arose when Mdlle de Cardoville had nothing
to disturb her mind the most gay and animated discussions in which M
de Montbron notwithstanding his mocking and sceptical humor his
long experience his rare knowledge of men and things his fashionable
training in a word had not always the advantage and even acknowledged
his defeat gayly enough Thus to give an idea of the differences of
the count and Adrienne before as he would say laughingly he had made
himself her accomplice he had always opposed from other motives than
those alleged by Madame de SaintDizier Adriennes wish to live alone
and in her own way whilst Rodin on the contrary by investing
the young girls resolve on this subject with an ideal grandeur of
intention had acquired a species of influence over her M de Montbron
now upwards of sixty years of age had been a most prominent character
during the Directory Consulate and the Empire His prodigal style of
living his wit his gayety his duels his amours and his losses at
play had given him a leading influence in the best society of his day
while his character his kindheartedness and liberality secured him
the lasting friendship of nearly all his female friends At the time
we now present him to the reader he was still a great gambler and
moreover a very lucky gambler He had as we have stated a very lordly
style his manners were decided but polished and lively his habits
were such as belong to the higher classes of society though he could be
excessively sharp towards people whom he did not like He was tall and
thin and his slim figure gave him an almost youthful appearance his
forehead was high and a little bald his hair was gray and short his
countenance long his nose aquiline his eyes blue and piercing and his
teeth white and still very good

The Count de Montbron said Georgette opening the door The count
entered and hastened to kiss Adriennes hand with a sort of paternal
familiarity

Come said M de Montbron to himself let us try to discover the
truth I am in search of that we may escape a great misfortune




CHAPTER VIII THE CONFESSION

Mdlle de Cardoville not wishing to betray the cause of the violent
feelings which agitated her received M de Montbron with a feigned and
forced gayety On the other hand notwithstanding his tact and knowledge
of the world the count was much embarrassed how to enter upon the
subject on which he wished to confer with Adrienne and he resolved
to feel his way before seriously commencing the conversation After
looking at the young lady for some seconds M de Montbron shook
his head and said with a sigh of regret My dear child I am not
pleased

Some affair of the heart or of hearts my dear count returned
Adrienne smiling

Of the heart said M de Montbron

What you so great a player think more of a womans whim than a throw
of the dice

I have a heavy heart and you are the cause of it my dear child

M de Montbron you will make me very proud said Adrienne with a
smile

You would be wrong for I tell you plainly my trouble is caused by
your neglect of your beauty Yes your countenance is pale dejected
sorrowful you have been lowspirited for the last few days you have
something on your mind I am sure of it

My dear M de Montbron you have so much penetration that you may be
allowed to fall for once as now I am not sad I have nothing on my
mind andI am about to utter a very silly piece of impertinenceI
have never thought myself so pretty

On the contrary nothing could be more modest than such an assertion
Who told you that falsehood a woman

No it was my heart and it spoke the truth answered Adrienne with a
slight degree of emotion Understand it if you can she added

Do you mean that you are proud of the alteration in your features
because you are proud of the sufferings of your heart said M de
Montbron looking at Adrienne with attention Be it so I am then
right You have some sorrow I persist in it added the count speaking
with a tone of real feeling because it is painful to me

Be satisfied I am as happy as possiblefor every instant I take
delight in repeating how at my age I am freeabsolutely free

Yes free to torment yourself free to be miserable

Come come my dear count said Adrienne you are recommencing
our old quarrel I still find in you the ally of my aunt and the Abbe
dAigrigny

Yes as the republicans are the allies of the legitimiststo destroy
each other in their turn Talking of your abominable aunt they say that
she holds a sort of council at her house these last few days a regular
mitred conspiracy She is certainly in a good way

Why not Formerly she would have wished to be Goddess of Reason now
we shall perhaps see her canonized She has already performed the first
part of the life of Mary Magdalen

You can never speak worse of her than she deserves my dear child
Still though for quite opposite reasons I agreed with her on the
subject of your wish to reside alone

I know it

Yes and because I wished to see you a thousand times freer than you
really are I advised you

To marry

No doubt you would have had your dear liberty with its consequences
only instead of Mdlle de Cardoville we should have called you Madame
Somebody having found an excellent husband to be responsible for your
independence

And who would have been responsible for this ridiculous husband And
who would bear a mocked and degraded name I perhaps said Adrienne
with animation No no my dear count good or ill I will answer for
my own actions to my name shall attach the reputation which I alone
have formed I am as incapable of basely dishonoring a name which is
not mine as of continually bearing it myself if it were not held in
esteem And as one can only answer for ones own actions I prefer to
keep my name

You are the only person in the world that has such ideas

Why said Adrienne laughing Because it appears to me horrible
to see a poor girl lost and buried in some ugly and selfish man and
become as they say seriously the better half of the monsteryes a
fresh and blooming rose to become part of a frightful thistleCome
my dear count confess there is something odious in this conjugal
metempsychosis added Adrienne with a burst of laughter

The forced and somewhat feverish gayety of Adrienne contrasted painfully
with her pale and suffering countenance it was so easy to see that she
strove to stifle with laughter some deep sorrow that M de Montbron
was much affected by it but dissembling his emotion he appeared to
reflect a moment and took up mechanically one of the new freshcut
books by which Adrienne was surrounded After casting a careless glance
at this volume he continued still dissembling his feelings Come my
dear madcap this is another folly Suppose I were twenty years old
and that you did me the honor to marry meyou would be called Lady de
Montbron I imagine

Perhaps

How perhaps Would you not bear my name if you married me

My dear count said Adrienne with a smile do not let us pursue this
hypothesis which can only leave usregrets

Suddenly M de Montbron started and looked at Mdlle de Cardoville
with an expression of surprise For some moments whilst talking to
Adrienne he had mechanicallytaken up two or three of the volumes
scattered over the couch and had glanced at their titles in the same
careless manner The first was the Modern History of India The
second Travels in India The third Letters on India Much
surprised M de Montbron had continued his investigation and found
that the fourth volume continued this Indian nomenclature being
Rambles in India The fifth was Recollections of Hindostan The
sixth Notes of a Traveller in the East Indies

Hence the astonishment which for many serious reasons M de Montbron
had no longer been able to conceal and which his looks betrayed to
Adrienne The latter having completely forgotten the presence of the
accusing volumes by which she was surrounded yielded to a movement of
involuntary confusion and blushed slightly but her firm and resolute
character again coming to her aid she looked full at M de Montbron
and said to him Well my dear count what surprises you

Instead of answering M de Montbron appeared still more absorbed in
thought and contemplating the young girl he could not forbear saying
to himself No noit is impossibleand yet

It would perhaps be indiscreet in me to listen to your soliloquy my
dear count said Adrienne

Excuse me my dear child but what I see surprises me so much

And pray what do you see

The traces of so great and novel an interest in all that relates to
India said M de Montbron laying a slight stress on his words and
fixing a piercing look upon the young girl

Well said Adrienne stoutly

Well I seek the cause of this sudden passion

Geographical said Mdlle de Cardoville interrupting M de Montbron
you may find this taste somewhat serious for my age my dear countbut
one must find occupation for leisure hoursand then having a cousin
who is both an Indian and a prince I should like to know something of
the fortunate country from which I derive this savage relationship

These last words were pronounced with a bitterness that was not lost on
M de Montbron watching Adrienne attentively he observed Meseems
you speak of the prince with some harshness

No I speak of him with indifference

Yet he deserves a very different feeling

On the part of some other person perhaps replied Adrienne dryly

He is so unhappy said M de Montbron in a tone of sincere pity
When I saw him the other day he made my heart ache

What have I to do with it exclaimed Adrienne with an accent of
painful and almost angry impatience

I should have thought that his cruel torments at least deserved your
pity answered the count gravely

Pityfrom me cried Adrienne with an air of offended pride Then
restraining herself she added coldly You are jesting M de Montbron
It is not in sober seriousness that you ask me to take interest in the
amorous torments of your prince

There was so much cold disdain in these last words of Adrienne her pale
and agitated countenance betrayed such haughty bitterness that M de
Montbron said sorrowfully It is then true I have not been deceived
I who thought from our old and constant friendship that I had some
claim to your confidence have known nothing of itwhile you told all to
another It is painful very painful to me

I do not understand you M de Montbron

Well then since I must speak plainly cried the count there is I
see no hope for this unhappy boyyou love another

As Adrienne startedOh you cannot deny it resumed the count
your paleness and melancholy for the last few days your implacable
indifference to the princeall prove to me that you are in love

Hurt by the manner in which the count spoke of the sentiment he
attributed to her Mdlle de Cardoville answered with dignified
stateliness You must know M de Montbron that a secret discovered is
not a confidence Your language surprises me

Oh my dear friend if I use the poor privilege of experienceif I
guess that you are in loveif I tell you so and even go so far as
to reproach you with itit is because the life or death of this poor
prince is concerned and I feel for him as if he were my son for it is
impossible to know him without taking the warmest interest in him

It would be singular returned Adrienne with redoubled coldness and
still more bitter irony if my loveadmitting I were in lovecould
have any such strange influence on Prince Djalma What can it matter to
him added she with almost agonizing disdain

What can it matter to him Now really my dear friend permit me to
tell you that it is you who are jesting cruelly What this unfortunate
youth loves you with all the blind ardor of a first lovetwice
has attempted to terminate by suicide the horrible tortures of his
passionand you think it strange that your love for another should be
with him a question of life or death

He loves me then cried the young girl with an accent impossible to
describe

He loves you to madness I tell you I have seen it

Adrienne seemed overcome with amazement From pale she became crimson
as the redness disappeared her lips grew white and trembled Her
emotion was so strong that she remained for some moments unable
to speak and pressed her hand to her heart as if to moderate its
pulsations

M de Montbron almost frightened at the sudden change in Adriennes
countenance hastily approached her exclaiming Good heaven my poor
child what is the matter

Instead of answering Adrienne waved her hand to him in sign that
he should not be alarmed and in fact the count was speedily
tranquillized for the beautiful face which had so lately been
contracted with pain irony and scorn seemed now expressive of the
sweetest and most ineffable emotions Adrienne appeared to luxuriate
in delight and to fear losing the least particle of it then as
reflection told her that she was perhaps the dupe of illusion or
falsehood she exclaimed suddenly with anguish addressing herself to
M de Montbron But is what you tell me true

What I tell you

Yesthat Prince Djalma

Loves you to madnessAlas it is only too true

No no cried Adrienne with a charming expression of simplicity
that could never be too true

What do you say cried the count

But that woman asked Adrienne as if the word scorched her lips

What woman

She who has been the cause of all these painful struggles

That womanwhy who should it be but you

What I Oh tell me was it I

On my word of honor I trust my experience I have never seen so ardent
and sincere a passion

Oh is it really so Has he never had any other love

Never

Yet I was told so

By whom

M Rodin

That Djalma

Had fallen violently in love two days after I saw him

M Rodin told you that cried M de Montbron as if struck with a
sudden idea Why it is he who told Djalma that you were in love with
some one else

I

And this it was which occasioned the poor youths dreadful despair

It was this which occasioned my despair

You love him then just as he loves you exclaimed M de Montbron
transported with joy

Love him said Mdlle de Cardoville A discreet knock at the door
interrupted Adrienne

One of your servants no doubt Be calm said the count

Come in said Adrienne in an agitated voice

What is it said Mdlle de Cardoville Florine entered the room

M Rodin has just been here Fearing to disturb mademoiselle he would
not come in but he will return in half an hour Will mademoiselle
receive him

Yes yes said the count to Florine even if I am still here show
him in by all means Is not that your opinion asked M de Montbron of
Adrienne

Quite so answered the young girl and a flash of indignation darted
from her eyes as she thought of Rodins perfidy

Oho the old knave said M de Montbron I always had my doubts
of that crooked neck Florine withdrew leaving the count with her
mistress




CHAPTER IX LOVE

Mdlle de Cardoville was transfigured For the first time her beauty
shone forth in all its lustre Until now overshadowed by indifference
or darkened by grief she appeared suddenly illumined by a brilliant ray
of sunshine The slight irritation caused by Rodins perfidy passed like
an imperceptible shade from her brow What cared she now for falsehood
and perfidy Had they not failed And for the future what human power
could interpose between her and Djalma so sure of each other Who would
dare to cross the path of those two things resolute and strong with the
irresistible power of youth love and liberty Who would dare to follow
them into that blazing sphere whither they went so beautiful and
happy to blend together in their inextinguishable love protected by
the proof armor of their own happiness Hardly had Florine left the
room when Adrienne approached M de Montbron with a rapid step
She seemed to have become taller and to watch her advancing light
radiant and triumphant one might have fancied her a goddess walking
upon clouds

When shall I see him was her first word to M de Montbron

Wellsay tomorrow he must be prepared for so much happiness in so
ardent a nature such sudden unexpected joy might be terrible

Adrienne remained pensive for a moment and then said rapidly To
morrowyesnot before tomorrow I have a superstition of the heart

What is it

You shall know HE LOVES MEthat word says all contains all
comprehends all is alland yet I have a thousand questions to ask
with regard to himbut I will ask none before tomorrow because by a
mysterious fatality tomorrow is with me a sacred anniversary It will
be an age till then but happily I can wait Look here

Beckoning M de Montbron she led him to the Indian Bacchus How much
it is like him said she to the count

Indeed exclaimed the latter it is strange

Strange returned Adrienne with a smile of gentle pride strange
that a hero a demigod an ideal of beauty should resemble Djalma

How you love him said M de Montbron deeply touched and almost
dazzled by the felicity which beamed from the countenance of Adrienne

I must have suffered a good deal do you not think so said she after
a moments silence

If I had not made up my mind to come here today almost in despair
what would have happened

I cannot tell I should perhaps have died for I am wounded mortally
hereshe pressed her hand to her heart But what might have been
death to me will now be life

It was horrible said the count shuddering Such a passion buried
in your own breast proud as you are

Yes proudbut not selfconceited When I learned his love for
another and that the impression which I fancied I had made on him at
our first interview had been immediately effaced I renounced all hope
without being able to renounce my love Instead of shunning his image
I surrounded myself with all that could remind me of him In default
of happiness there is a bitter pleasure in suffering through what we
love

I can now understand your Indian library

Instead of answering the count Adrienne took from the stand one of the
freshlycut volumes and bringing it to M de Montbron said to him
with a smile and a celestial expression of joy and happiness I was
wrongI am vain Just read thisaloud if you please I tell you that
I can wait for tomorrow Presenting the book to the count she pointed
out one passage with the tip of her charming finger Then she sank down
upon the couch and in an attitude of deep attention with her body
bent forward her hands crossed upon the cushion her chin resting upon
her hands her large eyes fixed with a sort of adoration on the Indian
Bacchus that was just opposite to her she appeared by this impassioned
contemplation to prepare herself to listen to M de Montbron

The latter much astonished began to read after again looking at
Adrienne who said to him in her most coaxing voice Very slowly I
beg of you

M de Montbron then read the following passage from the journal of a
traveller in India When I was at Bombay in 1829 I constantly heard
amongst the English there of a young hero the son of

The count having paused a second by reason of the barbarous spelling
of the name of Djalmas father Adrienne immediately said to him in her
soft voice The son of Kadjasing

What a memory said the count with a smile And he resumed A young
hero the son of Kadjasing king of Mundi On his return from a distant
and sanguinary expedition amongst the mountains against this Indian
king Colonel Drake was filled with enthusiasm for this son of
Kadjasing known as Djalma Hardly beyond the age of childhood this
young prince has in the course of this implacable war given proofs
of such chivalrous intrepidity and of so noble a character that his
father has been surnamed the Father of the Generous

That is a touching custom said the count To recompense the father
as it were by giving him a surname in honor of his son is a great
idea But how strange you should have met with this book added the
count in surprise I can understand there is matter here to inflame
the coolest head

Oh you will see you will see said Adrienne

The count continued to read Colonel Drake one of the bravest and
best officers of the English army said yesterday in my presence that
having been dangerously wounded and taken prisoner by Prince Djalma
after an energetic resistance he had been conveyed to the camp
established in the village of

Here there was the same hesitation on the part of the count on seeing
a still more barbarous name than the first so not wishing to try the
adventure he paused and said to Adrienne Now really I give this
up

And yet it is so easy replied Adrienne and she pronounced with
inexpressible softness a name in itself soft The village of
Shumshabad

You appear to have an infallible process for remembering geographical
names said the count continuing Once arrived at the camp Colonel
Drake received the kindest hospitality and Prince Djalma treated
him with the respect of a son It was there that the colonel became
acquainted with some facts which carried to the highest pitch his
enthusiasm for prince Djalma I heard him relate the two following

In one of the battles the prince was accompanied by a young Indian of
about twelve years of age whom he loved tenderly and who served him
as a page following him on horseback to carry his spare weapons
This child was idolized by its mother just as they set out on the
expedition she had entrusted her son to Prince Djalmas care saying
with a stoicism worthy of antiquity Let him be your brother He
shall be my brother had replied the prince In the height of a
disastrous defeat the child is severely wounded and his horse killed
the prince at peril of his life notwithstanding the perception of a
forced retreat disengages him and places him on the croup of his own
horse they are pursued a musketball strikes their steed who is just
able to reach a jungle in the midst of which after some vain efforts
he falls exhausted The child is unable to walk but the prince carries
him in his arms and hides with him in the thickest part of the jungle
The English arrive and begin their search but the two victims escape
After a night and a day of marches countermarches stratagems
fatigues unheardof perils the prince still carrying the child one
of whose legs is broken arrives at his fathers camp and says with
the utmost simplicity I had promised his mother that I would act a
brothers part by himand I have done so

That is admirable cried the count

Go onpray go on said Adrienne drying a tear without removing
her eyes from the basrelief which she continued to contemplate with
growing adoration

The count continued Another time Prince Djalma followed by two
black slaves went before sunrise to a very wild spot to seize a
couple of tiger cubs only a few days old The den had been previously
discovered The two old tigers were still abroad One of the blacks
entered the den by a narrow aperture the other aided by Djalma
cut down a tolerably large tree to prepare a trap for one of the old
tigers On the side of the aperture the cavern was exceedingly steep
The prince mounted to the top of it with agility to set his trap with
the aid of the other black Suddenly a dreadful roar was heard and in
a few bounds the tigress returning from the chase reached the opening
of the den The black who was laying the trap with the prince had his
skull fractured by her bite the tree falling across the entrance
prevented the female from penetrating the cavern and at the same time
stopped the exit of the black who had seized the cubs

About twenty feet higher upon a ledge of rock the prince lay flat
on the ground looking down upon this frightful spectacle The tigress
rendered furious by the cries of her little ones gnawed the hands of
the black who from the interior of the den strove to support
the trunk of the tree his only rampart whilst he uttered the most
lamentable outcries

It is horrible said the count

Oh go on pray go on exclaimed Adrienne with excitement you will
see what can be achieved by the heroism of goodness

The count pursued Suddenly the prince seized his dagger between his
teeth fastened his sash to a block of stone took his axe in one hand
and with the other slid down this substitute for a rope falling a few
steps from the wild beast he sprang upon her and swift as lightning
dealt her two mortal strokes just as the black losing his strength
was about to drop the trunk of the tree sure to have been torn to
pieces

And you are astonished at his resemblance with the demigod to whom
fable itself ascribes no more generous devotion cried the young lady
with still increasing excitement

I am astonished no longer I only admire said the count in a voice
of emotion and at these two noble instances of heroism my heart
beats with enthusiasm as if I were still twenty

And the noble heart of this traveller beat like yours at the recital
said Adrienne you will see

What renders so admirable the intrepidity of the prince is that
according to the principle of Indian castes the life of a slave is of
no importance thus a kings son risking his life for the safety of
a poor creature so generally despised obeyed an heroic and truly
Christian instinct of charity until then unheard of in this country

Two such actions said Colonel Drake with good reason are
sufficient to paint the man it is with a feeling of profound respect
and admiration therefore that I an obscure traveller have written
the name of Prince Djalma in my book and at the same time I have
experienced a kind of sorrow when I have asked myself what would be the
future fate of this prince buried in the depths of a savage country
always devastated by war However humble may be the homage that I pay
to this character worthy of the heroic age his name will at least be
repeated with generous enthusiasm by all those who have hearts that beat
in sympathy with what is great and noble

And just now when I read those simple and touching lines resumed
Adrienne I could not forbear pressing my lips to the name of the
traveller

Yes he is such as I thought him cried the count with still more
emotion as he returned the book to Adrienne who rose with a grave and
touching air and said to him It was thus I wished you to know him
that you might understand my adoration for this courage this heroic
goodness I had guessed beforehand when I was an involuntary listener
to his conversation From that moment I knew him to be generous as
intrepid tender and sensitive as energetic and resolute and when I saw
him so marvellously beautifulso different in the noble character of
his countenance and even in the style of his garments from all I had
hitherto met withwhen I saw the impression that I made upon him and
which I perhaps felt still more violentlyI knew that my whole life was
bound up with his love

And now what are your plans

Divine radiant as my heart When he learns his happiness I wish that
Djalma should feel dazzled as I do so as to prevent my gazing on my
sun for I repeat that until tomorrow will be a century to me Yes it
is strange I should have thought that after such a discovery I should
feel the want of being left alone plunged in an ocean of delicious
dreams But no from this time till tomorrowI dread solitudeI
feel a kind of feverish impatienceuneasyardentOh where is the
beneficent fairy that touching me with her wand will lull me into
slumber till tomorrow

I will be that beneficent fairy said the count smiling

You

Yes I

And how so

The power of my wand is this I will relieve you from a portion of your
thoughts by making them materially visible

Pray explain yourself

And my plan will have another advantage for you Listen to me you
are so happy now that you can hear anything Your odious aunt and her
equally odious friends are spreading the report that your residence
with Dr Baleinier

Was rendered necessary by the derangement of my mind said Adrienne
with a smile I expected that

It is stupid enough but as your resolution to live alone makes many
envious of you and many hostile you must feel that there will be no
want of persons ready to believe the most absurd calumny possible

I hope as much To pass for mad in the eyes of fools is very
flattering

Yes but to prove to fools that they are fools and that in the face
of all Paris is much more amusing Now people begin to talk of your
absence you have given up your daily rides for some time my niece has
appeared alone in our box at the Opera you wish to kill the time till
tomorrowwell here is an excellent opportunity It is two oclock
at halfpast three my niece will come in the carriage the weather is
splendid there is sure to be a crowd in the Bois de Boulogne You can
take a delightful ride and be seen by everybody Then as the air and
movement will have calmed your fever of happiness I will commence my
magic this evening and take you to India

To India

Into the midst of one of those wild forests in which roar the lion
the panther and the tiger We will have this heroic combat which so
moved you just now under our own eyes in all its terrible reality

Really my dear count you must be joking

Not at all I promise to show you real wild beasts formidable tenants
of the country of our demigodgrowling tigersroaring lionsdo you
not think that will be better than books

But how

Come I must give you the secret of my supernatural power On returning
from your ride you shall dine with my niece and we will go together
to a very curious spectacle now exhibiting at the PorteSaintMartin
Theatre A most extraordinary liontamer there shows you a number of
wild beasts in a state of nature in the midst of a forest here only
commences the illusion and has fierce combats with them alltigers
lions and panthers All Paris is crowding to these representations and
all Paris will see you there more charming than ever

I accept your offer said Adrienne with childish delight Yes
you are right I feel a strange pleasure in beholding these ferocious
monsters who will remind me of those that my demigod so heroically
overcame I accept also because for the first time in my life I am
anxious to be admiredeven by everybody I accept finally because
Here Mdlle de Cardoville was interrupted by a low knock at the door
and by the entrance of Florine who announced M Rodin




CHAPTER X THE EXECUTION

Rodin entered A rapid glance at Mdlle de Cardoville and M de Montbron
told him at once that he was in a dilemma In fact nothing could be
less encouraging than the faces of Adrienne and the count The latter
when he disliked people exhibited his antipathy as we have already
said by an impertinently aggressive manner which had before now
occasioned a good number of duels At sight of Rodin his countenance at
once assumed a harsh and insolent expression resting his elbow on the
chimneypiece and conversing with Adrienne he looked disdainfully over
his shoulder without taking the least notice of the Jesuits low bow
On the other hand at sight of this man Mdlle de Cardoville almost
felt surprise that she should experience no movement of anger or
hatred The brilliant flame which burned in her heart purified it from
every vindictive sentiment She smiled on the contrary for glancing
with gentle pride at the Indian Bacchus and then at herself she asked
herself what two beings so young and fair and free and loving
could have to fear from this old sordid man with his ignoble and base
countenance now advancing towards her with the writhing of a reptile
In a word far from feeling anger or aversion with regard to Rodin the
young lady seemed full of the spirit of mocking gayety and her large
eyes already lighted up with happiness now sparkled with irony and
mischief Rodin felt himself ill at ease People of his stamp greatly
prefer violent to mocking enemies They can encounter bursts of
ragesometimes by falling on their knees weeping groaning and
beating their breastssometimes by turning on their adversary armed
and implacable But they are easily disconcerted by biting raillery and
thus it was with Rodin He saw that between Adrienne de Cardoville and
M de Montbron he was about to be placed in what is vulgarly termed a
regular fix

The count opened the fire still glancing over his shoulder he said to
Rodin Ah you are here my benevolent gentleman

Pray sir draw a little nearer said Adrienne with a mocking smile
Best of friends and model of philosophersas well as declared enemy of
all fraud and falsehoodI have to pay you a thousand compliments

I accent anything from you my dear young lady even though
undeserved said the Jesuit trying to smile and thus exposing his
vile yellow teeth but may I be informed how I have earned these
compliments

Your penetration sir which is rare replied Adrienne

And your veracity sir said the count which is perhaps no less
rare

In what have I exhibited my penetration my dear young lady said
Rodin coldly In what my veracity added he turning towards M de
Montbron

In what sir said Adrienne Why you have guessed a secret
surrounded by difficulties and mystery In a word you have known how to
read the depths of a womans heart

I my dear young lady

You sir rejoice at it for your penetration has had the most
fortunate results

And your veracity has worked wonders added the count

It is pleasant to do good even without knowing it said Rodin still
acting on the defensive and throwing side glances by turns on the count
and Adrienne but will you inform me what it is that deserves this
praise

Gratitude obliges me to inform you of it said Adrienne maliciously
you have discovered and told Prince Djalma that I was passionately in
love Well I admire your penetration it was true

You have also discovered and told this lady that Prince Djalma
was passionately in love resumed the count Well I admire your
penetration my dear sir it was true

Rodin looked confused and at a loss for a reply

The person that I loved so passionately said Adrienne was the
prince

The person that the prince loved so passionately resumed the count
was this lady

These revelations so sudden and alarming almost stunned Rodin he
remained mute and terrified thinking of the future

Do you understand now sir the extent of our gratitude towards
you resumed Adrienne in a still more mocking tone Thanks to your
sagacity thanks to the touching interest you take in us the prince and
I are indebted to you for the knowledge of our mutual sentiments

The Jesuit had now gradually recovered his presence of mind and
his apparent calmness greatly irritated M de Montbron who but for
Adriennes presence would have assumed another tone than jests

There is some mistake said Rodin in what you have done me the honor
to tell me my dear young lady I have never in my life spoken of the
sentiments however worthy and respectable that you may entertain for
Prince Djalma

That is true replied Adrienne with scrupulous and exquisite
discretion whenever you spoke to me of the deep love felt by Prince
Djalma you carried your reserve and delicacy so far as to inform me
that it was not I whom he loved

And the same scruple induced you to tell the prince that Mdlle de
Cardoville loved some one passionatelybut that he was not the person
added the count

Sir answered Rodin dryly I need hardly tell you that I have no
desire to mix myself up with amorous intrigues

Come this is either pride or modesty said the count insolently
For your own interest pray do not advance such things for if we took
you at your word and it became known it might injure some of the nice
little trades that you carry on

There is one at least said Rodin drawing himself up as proudly as
M de Montbron whose rude apprenticeship I shall owe to you It is the
wearisome one of listening to your discourse

I tell you what my good sir replied the count disdainfully you
force me to remind you that there are more ways than one of chastising
impudent rogues

My dear count said Adrienne to M de Montbron with an air of
reproach

With perfect coolness Rodin replied I do not exactly see sir first
what courage is shown by threatening a poor old man like myself and
secondly

M Rodin said the count interrupting the Jesuit first a poor old
man like you who does evil under the shelter of the age he dishonors
is both cowardly and wicked and deserves a double chastisement
secondly with regard to this question of age I am not aware that
gamekeepers and policemen bow down respectfully to the gray coats of old
wolves and the gray hairs of old thieves What do you think my good
sir

Still impassible Rodin raised his flabby eyelids fixed for hardly a
second his little reptile eye upon the count and darted at him one of
his rapid cold and piercing glancesand then the livid eyelid again
covered the dull eye of that corpselike face

Not having the disadvantage of being an old wolf and still less an
old thief said Rodin quietly you will permit me sir to take no
account of the pursuit of hunters and police As for the reproaches made
me I have a very simple method of answeringI do not say of justifying
myselfI never justify myself

You dont say said the count

Never resumed Rodin coolly my acts are sufficient for that I
will then simply answer that seeing the deep violent almost fearful
impression made by this lady on the prince

Let this assurance which you give me of the princes love said
Adrienne interrupting Rodin with an enchanting smile absolve you of
all the evil you wished to do me The sight of our happiness be your
only punishment

It may be that I need neither absolution nor punishment for as I have
already had the honor to observe to the count my dear young lady the
future will justify my acts Yes it was my duty to tell the prince that
you loved another than himself and to tell you that he loved another
than yourselfall in your mutual interest That my attachment for you
may have misled me is possibleI am not infallible but after my past
conduct towards you my dear young lady I have perhaps some right to
be astonished at seeing myself thus treated This is not a complaint If
I never justify myself I never complain either

Now really there is something heroic in all this my good sir said
the count You do not condescend to complain or justify yourself with
regard to the evil you have done

The evil I have done said Rodin looking fixedly at the count Are
we playing at enigmas

What sir cried the count with indignation is it nothing by your
falsehoods to have plunged the prince into so frightful a state of
despair that he has twice attempted his life Is it nothing by similar
falsehoods to have induced this lady to believe so cruel and complete
an error that but for the resolution I have today taken it might have
led to the most fatal consequences

And will you do me the honor to tell me sir what interest I could
have in all this despair and error admitting even that I had wished to
produce them

Some great interest no doubt said the count bluntly the more
dangerous that it is concealed You are one of those I see to whom the
woes of others are pleasure and profit

That is really too much sir said Rodin bowing I should be quite
contented with the profit

Your impudent coolness will not deceive me this is a serious matter
said the count It is impossible that so perfidious a piece of roguery
can be an isolated act Who knows but this may still be one of the
fruits of Madame de SaintDiziers hatred for Mdlle de Cardoville

Adrienne had listened to the preceding discussion with deep attention
Suddenly she started as if struck by a sudden revelation

After a moments silence she said to Rodin without anger without
bitterness but with an expression of gentle and serene calmness We
are told sir that happy love works miracles I should be tempted
to believe it for after some minutes reflection and when I recall
certain circumstances your conduct appears to me in quite a new light

And what may this new perspective be my dear young lady

That you may see it from my point of view sir allow me to remind you
of a few facts That sewinggirl was generously devoted to me she had
given me unquestionable proofs of her attachment Her mind was equal
to her noble heart but she had an invincible dislike to you All on a
sudden she disappears mysteriously from my house and you do your
best to cast upon her odious suspicions M de Montbron has a paternal
affection for me but as I must confess little sympathy for you and
you have always tried to produce a coldness between us Finally Prince
Djalma has a deep affection for me and you employ the most perfidious
treachery to kill that sentiment within him For what end do you act
thus I do not know but certainly with some hostile design

It appears to me madame said Rodin severely that you have
forgotten services performed

I do not deny sir that you took me from the house of Dr Baleinier
but a few days sooner or later I must infallibly have been released by
M de Montbron

You are right my dear child said the count it may be that your
enemies wished to claim the merit of what must necessarily have happened
through the exertions of your friends

You are drowning and I save youit is all a mistake to feel
grateful said Rodin bitterly some one else would no doubt have
saved you a little later

The comparison is wanting in exactness said Adrienne with a smile
a lunatic asylum is not a river and though from what I see I think
you quite capable of diving you have had no occasion to swim on this
occasion You merely opened a door for me which would have opened of
itself a little later

Very good my dear child said the count laughing heartily at
Adriennes reply

I know sir that your care did not extend to me only The daughters
of Marshal Simon were brought back by you but we may imagine that the
claim of the Duke de Ligny to the possession of his daughters would not
have been in vain You returned to an old soldier his imperial cross
which he held to be a sacred relic it is a very touching incident
Finally you unmasked the Abbe dAigrigny and Dr Baleinier but I had
already made up my mind to unmask then However all this proves that
you are a very clever man

Oh madame said Rodin humbly

Full of resources and invention

Oh madame

It is not my fault if in our long interview at Dr Baleiniers you
betrayed that superiority of mind which struck me so forcibly and
which seems to embarrass you so much at present What would you have
sirgreat minds like yours find it difficult to maintain their
incognito Yet as by different waysoh very different added the
young lady maliciously we are tending to the same end still keeping
in view our conversation at Dr Baleiniers I wish for the sake of
our future communion as you call it to give you a piece of advice and
speak frankly to you

Rodin had listened to Mdlle de Cardoville with apparent impassibility
holding his hat under his arm and twirling his thumbs whilst his hands
were crossed upon his waistcoat The only external mark of the intense
agitation into which he was thrown by the calm words of Adrienne was
that the livid eyelids of the Jesuit which had been hypocritically
closed became gradually red as the blood flowed into them
Nevertheless he answered Mdlle de Cardoville in a firm voice and with
a low bow Good advice and frankness are always excellent things

You see sir resumed Adrienne with some excitement happy love
bestows such penetration such energy such courage as enables one to
laugh at perils to detect stratagems and to defy hatred Believe me
the divine light which surrounds two loving hearts will be sufficient to
disperse all darkness and reveal every snare You see in Indiaexcuse
my weakness but I like to talk of India added the young girl with
a smile of indescribable grace and meaningin India when travellers
sleep at night they kindle great fires round their ajoupa excuse this
touch of local coloring and far as extends the luminous circle it
puts to flight by its mere brilliancy all the impure and venomous
reptiles that shun the day and live only in darkness

The meaning of this comparison has quite escaped me said Rodin
continuing to twirl his thumbs and half raising his eyelids which were
getting redder and redder

I will speak more plainly said Adrienne with a smile Suppose
sir that the last is a service which you have rendered me and the
princefor you only proceed by way of servicesthat I acknowledge is
novel and ingenious

Bravo my dear child said the count joyfully The execution will be
complete

Oh this is meant for an execution said Rodin still impassible

No sir answered Adrienne with a smile it is a simple conversation
between a poor young girl and an old philosopher the friend of
humanity Suppose then that these frequent services that you have
rendered to me and mine have suddenly opened my eyes or rather added
the young girl in a serious tone suppose that heaven who gives to
the mother the instinct to defend her child has given me along with
happiness the instinct to preserve my happiness and that a vague
presentiment by throwing light on a thousand circumstances until now
obscure has suddenly revealed to me that instead of being the friend
you are perhaps the most dangerous enemy of myself and family

So we pass from the execution to suppositions said Rodin still
immovable

And from suppositions sir if you must have it to certainty resumed
Adrienne with dignified firmness yes now I believe that I was for
awhile your dupe and I tell you without hate without anger but with
regretthat it is painful to see a man of your sense and intelligence
stoop to such machinations and after having recourse to so many
diabolical manoeuvres finish at last by being ridiculous for believe
me there is nothing more ridiculous for a man like you than to
be vanquished by a young girl who has no weapon no defence no
instructor but her love In a word sir I look upon you from today as
an implacable and dangerous enemy for I half perceive your aim without
guessing by what means you will seek to accomplish it No doubt your
future means will be worthy of the past Well in spite of all this
I do not fear you From tomorrow my family will be informed of
everything and an active intelligent resolute union will keep us all
upon our guard for it doubtless concerns this enormous inheritance of
which they wish to deprive us Now what connection can there be between
the wrongs I reproach you with and the pecuniary end proposed I do
not at all knowbut you have told me yourself that our enemies are
so dangerously skillful and their craft so farreaching that we must
expect all be prepared for all I will remember the lesson I have
promised you frankness sir and now I suppose you have it

It would be an imprudent frankness if I were your enemy said Rodin
still impassible but you also promised me some advice my dear young
lady

My advice will be short do not attempt to continue the struggle
because you see there is something stronger than you and yoursit is
a womans resolve defending her happiness

Adrienne pronounced these last words with so sovereign a confidence her
beautiful countenance shone as is it were with such intrepid joy
that Rodin notwithstanding his phlegmatic audacity was for a moment
frightened Yet he did not appear in the least disconcerted and after
a moments silence he resumed with an air of almost contemptuous
compassion My dear young lady we may perhaps never meet again it is
probable Only remember one thing which I now repeat to you I never
justify myself The future will provide for that Notwithstanding which
my dear young lady I am your humble servant and he made her a low
bow

Count I beg to salute you most respectfully he added bowing still
more humbly to M de Montbron and he went out

Hardly had Rodin left the room than Adrienne ran to her desk and
writing a few hasty lines sealed the note and said to M de Montbron
I shall not see the prince before tomorrowas much from superstition
of the heart as because it is necessary for my plans that this interview
should be attended with some little solemnity You shall know all but I
write to him on the instant for with an enemy like M Rodin one must
be prepared for all

You are right my dear child quick the letter Adrienne gave it to
him

I tell him enough said she to calm his grief and not enough to
deprive me of the delicious happiness of the surprise I reserve for to
morrow

All this has as much sense as heart in it I will hasten to the
princes abode to deliver your letter I shall not see him for I
could not answer for myself But come our proposed drive our evenings
amusement are still to hold good

Certainly I have more need than ever to divert my thoughts till
to morrow I feel too that the fresh air will do me good for this
interview with M Rodin has warmed me a little

The old wretch but we will talk further of him I will hasten to the
princes and return with Madame de Morinval to fetch you to the Champs
Elysees

The Count de Montbron withdrew precipitately as joyful at his departure
as he had been sad on his arrival




CHAPTER XI THE CHAMPSELYSEES

It was about two hours after the interview of Rodin with Mdlle de
Cardoville Numerous loungers attracted to the ChampsElysees by the
serenity of a fine spring day it was towards the end of the month of
March stopped to admire a very handsome equipage A brightblue open
carriage with whiteandblue wheels drawn by four superb horses
of cream color with black manes and harness glittering with silver
ornaments mounted by two boy postilions of equal size with black
velvet caps lightblue cassimere jackets with white collars buckskin
breeches and topboots two tall powdered footmen also in lightblue
livery with white collars and facings being seated in the rumble
behind

No equipage could have been turned out in better style The horses full
of blood spirit and vigor were skillfully managed by the postilions
and stepped with singular regularity gracefully keeping time in their
movements champing their bits covered with foam and ever and anon
shaking their cockades of blue and white silk with long floating ends
and a bright rose blooming in the midst

A man on horseback dressed with elegant simplicity keeping at the
other side of the avenue contemplated with proud satisfaction
this equipage which he had as it were created It was M de
BonnevilleAdriennes equerry as M de Montbron called himfor the
carriage belonged to that young lady A change had taken place in the
plan for this magic days amusement M de Montbron had not been able to
deliver Mdlle de Cardovilles note to Prince Djalma Faringhea had told
him that the prince had gone that morning into the country with Marshal
Simon and would not be back before evening The letter should be given
him on his arrival Completely satisfied as to Djalma knowing that
he could find these few lines which without informing him of the
happiness that awaited him would at least give him some idea of it
Adrienne had followed the advice of M de Montbron and gone to the
drive in her own carriage to show all the world that she had quite
made up her mind in spite of the perfidious reports circulated by the
Princess de Saint Dizier to keep to her resolution of living by herself
in her own way Adrienne wore a small white bonnet with a fall of
blonde which well became her rosy face and golden hair her high
dress of garnetcolored velvet was almost hidden beneath a large green
cashmere shawl The young Marchioness de Morinval who was also very
pretty and elegant was seated at her right M de Montbron occupied the
front seat of the carriage

Those who know the Parisian world or rather that imperceptible
fraction of the world of Paris which goes every fine sunny day to the
Champs Elysees to see and be seen will understand that the presence
of Mdlle de Cardoville on that brilliant promenade was an extraordinary
and interesting event

The world as it is called could hardly believe its eyes on seeing
this lady of eighteen possessed of princely wealth and belonging to
the highest nobility thus prove to every one by this appearance in
public that she was living completely free and independent contrary to
all custom and received notions of propriety This kind of emancipation
appeared something monstrous and people were almost astonished that
the graceful and dignified bearing of the young lady should belie so
completely the calumnies circulated by Madame de SaintDizier and her
friends with regard to the pretended madness of her niece Many beaux
profiting by their acquaintance with the Marchioness de Morinval or M
de Montbron came by turns to pay their respects and rode for a few
minutes by the side of the carriage so as to have an opportunity
of seeing admiring and perhaps hearing Mdlle de Cardoville she
surpassed their expectations by talking with her usual grace and
spirit Then surprise and enthusiasm knew no bounds What had at first
been blamed as an almost insane caprice was now voted a charming
originality and it only depended on Mdlle de Cardoville herself to be
declared from that day the queen of elegance and fashion The young lady
understood very well the impression she had made she felt proud and
happy for she thought of Djalma when she compared him to all these
men of fashion her happiness was the more increased And verily these
young men most of whom had never quitted Paris or had ventured at most
as far as Naples or Baden looked insignificant enough by the side of
Djalma who at his age had so many times commanded and combated in
bloody wars and whose reputation far courage and generosity mentioned
by travellers with admiration had already reached from India to Paris
And then how could these charming exquisites with their small hats
their scanty frockcoats and their huge cravats compare with the
Indian prince whose graceful and manly beauty was still heightened by
the splendor of a costume at once so rich and so picturesque

On this happy day all was joy and love for Adrienne The sun setting
in a splendidly serene sky flooded the promenade with its golden light
The air was warm Carriages and horsemen passed and repassed in rapid
succession a light breeze played with the scarfs of the women and
the plumes in their bonnets all around was noise movement sunshine
Adrienne leaning back in her carriage amused herself with watching
this busy scene sparkling with Parisian luxury but in the vortex
of this brilliant chaos she saw in thought the mild melancholy
countenance of Djalmawhen suddenly something fell into her lap and
she started It was a bunch of halffaded violets At the same instant
she heard a childs voice following the carriage and saying For the
love of heaven my good lady one little sou Adrienne turned her head
and saw a poor little girl pale and wan with mild sorrowful features
scarcely covered with rags holding out her hand and raising her eyes
in supplication Though the striking contrast of extreme misery side
by side with extreme luxury is so common that it no longer excites
attention Adrienne was deeply affected by it She thought of Mother
Bunch now perhaps the victim of frightful destitution

Ah at least thought the young lady let not this day be one of
happiness for me alone

She leaned from the carriagewindow and said to the poor child Have
you a mother my dear

No my lady I have neither father nor mother

Who takes care of you

No one my lady They give me nosegays to sell and I must bring home
moneyor they beat me

Poor little thing

A sou my good ladya sou for the love of heaven said the child
continuing to follow the carriage which was then moving slowly

My dear count said Adrienne smiling and addressing M de Montbron
you are unfortunately no novice at an elopement Please to stretch
forth your arms take up that child with both hands and lift her into
the carriage We can hide her between Lady de Morinval and myself and
we can drive away before any one perceives this audacious abduction

What said the count in surprise You wish

Yes I beg you to do it

What a folly

Yesterday you might perhaps have treated this caprice as a folly
but today said Adrienne laying great stress upon the word and
glancing at M de Montbron with a significant air today you should
understand that it is almost a duty

Yes I understand you good and noble heart said the count
with emotion while Lady de Morinval who knew nothing of Mdlle de
Cardovilles love for Djalma looked with as much surprise as curiosity
at the count and the young lady

M de Montbron leaning from the carriage stretched out his arms
towards the child and said to her Give me your hands little girl

Though much astonished the child obeyed mechanically and held out both
her little arms then the count took her by the wrists and lifted her
lightly from the ground which he did the more easily as the carnage
was very low and its progress by no means rapid More stupefied than
frightened the child said not a word Adrienne and Lady de Morinval
made room for her to crouch down between them and the little girl was
soon hidden beneath the shawls of the two young women All this was
executed so quickly that it was hardly perceived by a few persons
passing in the sideavenues

Now my dear count said Adrienne radiant with pleasure let us make
off at once with our prey

M de Montbron half rose and called to the postilions Home and the
four horses started at once into a rapid and regular trot

This day of happiness now seems consecrated and my luxury is excused
thought Adrienne till I can again meet with that poor Mother Bunch
and from this day I will make every exertion to find her out her place
will at least not be quite empty

There are often strange coincidences in life At the moment when this
thought of the hunchback crossed the mind of Adrienne a crowd had
collected in one of the sideavenues and other persons soon ran to join
the group

Look uncle said Lady de Morinval how many people are assembled
yonder What can it be Shall we stop and send to inquire

I am sorry my dear but your curiosity cannot be satisfied said
the count drawing out his watch it will soon be six oclock and the
exhibition of the wild beasts begin at eight We shall only just have
time to go home and dine Is not that your opinion my dear child said
he to Adrienne

And yours Julia said Mdlle de Cardoville to the marchioness

Oh certainly answered her friend

I am the less inclined to delay resumed the count as when I have
taken you to the PorteSaintMartin I shall be obliged to go for half
anhour to my club to ballot for Lord Campbell whom I propose

Then Adrienne and I will be left alone at the play uncle

Your husband will go with you I suppose

True dear uncle but do not quite leave us because of that

Be sure I shall not for I am curious as you are to see these terrible
animals and the famous Morok the incomparable liontamer

A few minutes after Mdlle de Cardovilles carriage had left the Champs
Elysees carrying with it the little girl and directing its course
towards the Rue dAnjou As the brilliant equipage disappeared from
the scene the crowd of which we before have spoken greatly increased
about one of the large trees in the ChampsElysees and expressions of
pity were heard here and there amongst the groups A lounger approached
a young man on the skirts of the crowd and said to him What is the
matter sir

I hear it is a poor young girl a hunchback that has fallen from
exhaustion

A hunchback is that all There will always be enough hunchbacks said
the lounger brutally with a coarse laugh

Hunchback or not if she dies of hunger answered the young man
scarcely able to restrain his indignation it will be no less sadand
there is really nothing to laugh at sir

Die of hunger pooh said the lounger shrugging his shoulders It
is only lazy scoundrels that will not work who die of hunger And it
serves them right

I wager sir there is one death you will never die of cried the
young man incensed at the cruel insolence of the lounger

What do you mean answered the other haughtily

I mean sir that your heart is not likely to kill you

Sir cried the lounger in an angry tone

Well what sir replied the young man looking full in his face

Nothing said the lounger turning abruptly on his heel and grumbling
as he sauntered towards an orangecolored cabriolet on which was
emblazoned an enormous coatofarms surmounted by a barons crest
A servant in green livery ridiculously laced with gold was standing
beside the horse and did not perceive his master

Are you catching flies fool said the latter pushing him with his
cane The servant turned round in confusion Sir said he

Will you never learn to call me Monsieur le Baron rascal cried his
master in a rageOpen the door directly

The lounger was Baron Tripeaud the manufacturing baron the
stockjobber The poor hunchback was Mother Bunch who had indeed
fallen with hunger and fatigue whilst on her way to Mdlle de
Cardovilles The unfortunate creature had found courage to brave the
shame of the ridicule she so much feared by returning to that house
from which she was a voluntary exile but this time it was not for
herself but for her sister Cephysethe Bacchanal Queen who had
returned to Paris the previous day and whom Mother Bunch now sought
through the means of Adrienne to rescue from a most dreadful fate

Two hours after these different scenes an enormous crowd pressed round
the doors of the PorteSaintMartin to witness the exercises of Morok
who was about to perform a mock combat with the famous black panther of
Java named Death Adrienne accompanied by Lord and Lady de Morinval
now stepped from a carriage at the entrance of the theatre They were to
be joined in the course of the evening by M de Montbron whom they had
dropped in passing at his club




CHAPTER XII BEHIND THE SCENES

The large theatre of the PorteSaintMartin was crowded by an impatient
multitude All Paris had hurried with eager and burning curiosity to
Moroks exhibition It is quite unnecessary to say that the liontamer
had completely abandoned his small taste in religious baubles which he
had so successfully carried on at the White Falcon Inn at Leipsic
There were moreover numerous tokens by which the surprising effects
of Moroks sudden conversion had been blazoned in the most extraordinary
pictures the antiquated baubles in which he had formerly dealt would
have found no sale in Paris Morok had nearly finished dressing himself
in one of the actors rooms which had been lent to him Over a coat of
mail with cuishes and brassarts he wore an ample pair of red trousers
fastened round his ankles by broad rings of gilt brass His long caftan
of black cloth embroidered with scarlet and gold was bound round his
waist and wrist by other large rings of gilt metal This sombre costume
imparted to him an aspect still more ferocious His thick and redhaired
beard fell in large quantities down to his chest and a long piece
of white muslin was folded round his red head A devout missionary in
Germany and an actor in Paris Morok knew as well as his employers the
Jesuits how to accommodate himself to circumstances

Seated in one corner of the room and contemplating with a sort of
stupid admiration was Jacques Rennepont better known as Sleepinbuff
from the likelihood that he would end his days in rags or his present
antipathy to great care in dress Since the day Hardys factory had
been destroyed by fire Jacques had not quitted Morok passing
the nights in excesses which had no baneful effects on the iron
constitution of the liontamer On the others features on the
contrary a great alteration was perceptible his hollow cheeks marble
pallor his eyes by turns dull and heavy or gleaming with lurid
fire betrayed the ravages of debauchery his parched lips were almost
constantly curled by a bitter and sardonic smile His spirit once
gay and sanguine still struggled against the besotting influence of
habitual intoxication Unfitted for labor no longer able to forego
gross pleasures Jacques sought to drown in wine a few virtuous impulses
which he still possessed and had sunk so low as to accept without shame
the large dole of sensual gratification proffered him by Morok who paid
all the expenses of their orgies but never gave him money in order
that he might be completely dependent on him After gazing at Morok for
some time in amazement Jacques said to him in a familiar tone Well
yours is a famous trade you may boast that at this moment there are
not two men like you in the whole world Thats flattering Its a pity
you dont stick to this fine trade

What do you mean

Why how is the conspiracy going on in whose honor you make me keep it
up all day and all night

It is working but the time is not yet come that is why I wish to have
you always at hand till the great day Do you complain

Hang it no said Jacques What could I do Burnt up with brandy as
I am if I wanted to work Ive no longer the strength to do so I have
not like you a head of marble and a body of iron but as for fuddling
myself with gunpowder instead of anything else thatll do for me Im
only fit for that work nowand then it will drive away thought

Oh what kind

You know that when I do think I think only of one thing said
Jacques gloomily

The Bacchanal queenstill said Morok in a disdainful tone

Still rather when I shall think of her no longer I shall be deador
stupefied Fiend

You were never better or more intelligent you fool replied Morok
fastening his turban The conversation was here interrupted Moroks
aider entered hastily

The gigantic form of this Hercules had increased in width He was
habited like Alcides his enormous limbs furrowed with veins as thick
as whipcord were covered with a closefitting fleshcolored garment to
which a pair of red drawers formed a strong contrast

Why do you rush in like a storm Goliath said Morok

Theres a pretty storm in the house they are beginning to get
impatient and are calling out like madmen But if that were all

Well what else

Death will not be able to play this evening

Morok turned quickly around He seemed uneasy Why so he exclaimed

I have just seen her shes crouching at the bottom of her cage her
ears lie so close to her head she looks as if they had been cut off
You know what that means

Is that all said Morok turning to the glass to complete his head
dress

Its quite enough shes in one of her tearing fits Since that night
in Germany when she ripped up that old hack of a white horse Ive not
seen her look so savage her eyes shine like burning candles

Then she must have her fine collar on said Morok quietly

Her fine collar

Yes her springcollar

And I must be ladysmaid said the giant A nice toilet to attend
to

Hold your tongue

Thats not all continued Goliath hesitating

What more

I might as well tell you at once

Will you speak

Well he is here

Who you stupid brute

The Englishman

Morok started his arms fell powerless by his side Jacques was struck
with the liontamers paleness and troubled countenance

The Englishmanyou have seen him cried Morok addressing Goliath
You are quite sure

Quite sure I was looking through the peephole in the curtain I saw
him in one of the stageboxeshe wishes to see things close hes easy
to recognize with his pointed forehead big nose and goggle eyes

Morok shuddered again usually fierce and unmoved he appeared to be
more and more agitated and so alarmed that Jacques said to him Who
is this Englishman

He has followed me from Strasburg where he fell in with me said
Morok with visible dejection He travelled with his own horses by
short stages as I did stopping where I stopped so as never to miss
one of my exhibitions But two days before I arrived at Paris he left
meI thought I was rid of him said Morok with a sigh

Rid of himhow you talk replied Jacques surprised such a good
customer such an admirer

Aye said Morok becoming more and more agitated this wretch has
wagered an enormous sum that I will be devoured in his presence
during one of my performances he hopes to win his wagerthat is why he
follows me about

Sleepinbuff found the John Bulls idea so amusingly eccentric that for
the first time since a very long period he burst into a peal of hearty
laughter Morok pale with rage rushed towards him with so menacing an
air that Goliath was obliged to interpose

Come come said Jacques dont be angry if it is serious I will
not laugh any more

Morok was appeased and said to Sleepinbuff in a hoarse voice Do you
think me a coward

No by heaven

Well And yet this Englishman with his grotesque face frightens me
more than any tiger or my panther

You say so and I believe it replied Jacques but I cannot
understand why the presence of this man should alarm you

But consider you dull knave cried Morok that obliged to watch
incessantly the least movement of the ferocious beast whom I keep in
subjection by my action and my looks there is something terrible in
knowing that two eyes are therealways therefixedwaiting till
the least absence of mind shall expose me to be torn in pieces by the
animals

Now I understand said Jacques shuddering in his turn It is
terrible

Yes for once there though I may not see this cursed Englishman I
fancy I have his two round eyes fixed and wide open always before me
My tiger Cain once nearly mutilated my arm when my attention was drawn
away by this Englishman whom the devil take Blood and thunder cried
Morok this man will be fatal to me And Morok paced the room in great
agitation

Besides Death lays her ears close to her skull said Goliath
brutally If you persistmind I tell youthe Englishman will win his
wager this evening

Go away you brutedont vex my head with your confounded
predictions cried Morok go and prepare Deaths collar

Well every one to his taste you wish the panther to taste you said
the giant stalking heavily away after this joke

But if you feel these fears said Jacques why do you not say that
the panther is ill

Morok shrugged his shoulders and replied with a sort of feverish
ferocity Have you ever heard of the fierce pleasure of the gamester
who stakes his honor his life upon a card Well I tooin these daily
exhibitions where my life is at stakefind a wild fierce pleasure in
braving death before a crowded assembly shuddering and terrified at my
audacity Yes even in the fear with which this Englishman inspires me
I find in spite of myself a terrible excitement which I abhor and
which yet subjugates me

At this moment the stagemanager entered the room and interrupted the
beasttamer May we give the signal M Morok said the stagemanager
The overture will not last above ten minutes

I am ready said Morok

The policeinspector has just now given orders that the double chain
of the panther and the iron ring riveted to the floor of the stage at
the end of the cavern in the foreground shall be again examined and
everything has been reported quite secure

Yessecureexcept for me murmured the beasttamer

So M Morok the signal may be given

The signal maybe given replied Morok And the manager went out




CHAPTER XIII UP WITH THE CURTAIN

The usual bell sounded with solemnity behind the scenes the overture
began and to say the truth but little attention was paid to it The
interior of the theatre offered a very animated view With the exception
of two stageboxes even with the dress circle one to the left the
other to the right of the audience every seat was occupied A great
number of very fashionable ladies attracted as is always the case by
the strange wildness of the spectacle filled the boxes The stalls were
crowded by most of the young men who in the morning had walked their
horses on the ChampsElysees The observations which passed from one
stall to another will give some idea of their conversation

Do you know my dear boy there would not be so crowded or fashionable
an audience to witness Racines Athalia

Undoubtedly What is the beggarly howling of an actor compared to the
roaring of the lion

I cannot understand how the authorities permit this Morok to fasten his
panther with a chain to an iron ring in the corner of the stage If the
chain were to break

Talking of broken chainstheres little Mme de Blinville who is no
tigress Do you see her in the second tier opposite

It becomes her very well to have broken as you say the marriage
chain she looks very well this season

Oh there is the beautiful Duchess de SaintPrix all the world is here
tonightI dont speak of ourselves

It is a regular opera nightwhat a festive scene

Well after all people do well to amuse themselves perhaps it will
not be for long

Why so

Suppose the cholera were to come to Paris

Oh nonsense

Do you believe in the cholera

To be sure I do Hes coming from the North with his walkingstick
under his arm

The devil take him on the road dont let us see his green visage
here

They say hes at London

A pleasant journey to him

Come let us talk of something else it may be a weakness if you
please but I call this a dull subject

I believe you

Oh gentlemenI am not mistakennoit is she

Who then

Mdlle de Cardoville She is coming into the stagebox with Morinval
and his wife It is a complete resuscitation this morning on the
ChampsElysees in the evening here

Faith you are right It is Mdlle de Cardoville

Good heaven how lovely she is

Lend me your eyeglass

Well what do you think of her

Exquisitedazzling

And in addition to her beauty an inexhaustible flow of wit three
hundred thousand francs a year high birth eighteen years of age
andfree as air

Yes that is to say that provided it pleased her I might be to
morrowor even todaythe happiest of men

It is enough to turn ones brain

I am told that her mansion Rue dAnjou is like an enchanted palace a
great deal is said about a bathroom and bedroom worthy of the Arabian
Nights

And free as airI come back to that

Ah if I were in her place

My levity would be quite shocking

Oh gentlemen what a happy man will he be who is loved first

You think then that she will have many lovers

Being as free as air

All the boxes are full except the stagebox opposite to that in which
Mdlle de Cardoville is seated Happy the occupiers of that box

Did you see the English ambassadors lady in the dress circle

And the Princess dAlvimarwhat an enormous bouquet

I should like to know the nameof that nosegay

Ohits Germigny

How flattering for the lions and tigers to attract so fashionable an
audience

Do you notice gentlemen how all the women are eyeglassing Mdlle de
Cardoville

She makes a sensation

She is right to show herself they gave her out as mad

Oh gentlemen what a capital phiz

Wherewhere

Therein the omnibusbox beneath Mdlle de Cardovilles

Its a Nuremburg nutcracker

An ourangoutang

Did you ever see such round staring eyes

And the nose

And the forehead

Its a caricature

Order order the curtain rises

And in fact the curtain rose Some explanation is necessary for the
clear understanding of what follows In the lower stagebox to the left
of the audience were several persons who had been referred to by the
young men in the stalls The omnibusbox was occupied by the Englishman
the eccentric and portentous bettor whose presence inspired Morok with
so much dread

It would require Hoffmans rare and fantastic genius to describe
worthily that countenance at once grotesque and frightful as it stood
out from the dark background of the box This Englishman was about fifty
years old his forehead was quite bald and of a conical shape beneath
this forehead surmounted by eyebrows like parenthesis marks glittered
large green eyes remarkably round and staring and set very close to a
hooked nose extremely sharp and prominent a chin like that on the old
fashioned nutcrackers was halfhidden in a broad and ample white cravat
as stifflystarched as the roundcornered shirtcollar which nearly
touched his ears The face was exceedingly thin and bony and yet the
complexion was highcolored approaching to purple which made the
bright green of the pupils and the white of the other part of the
eyes still more conspicuous The mouth which was very wide sometimes
whistled inaudibly the tune of a Scotch jig always the same tune
sometimes was slightly curled with a sardonic smite The Englishman was
dressed with extreme care his blue coat with brass buttons displayed
his spotless waistcoat snowy white as his ample cravat his shirt was
fastened with two magnificent ruby studs and his patrician hands were
carefully kid gloved

To any one who knew the eccentric and cruel desire which attracted this
man to every representation his grotesque face became almost terrific
instead of exciting ridicule and it was easy to understand the dread
experience by Morok at sight of those great staring round eyes which
appeared to watch for the death of the liontamer what a horrible
death with unshaken confidence Above the dark box of the Englishman
affording a graceful contrast were seated the Morinvals and Mdlle
de Cardoville The latter was placed nearest the stage Her head was
uncovered and she wore a dress of skyblue China crepe ornamented at
the bosom with a brooch of the finest Oriental pearlsnothing more yet
Adrienne thus attired was charming She held in her hand an enormous
bouquet composed of the rarest flowers of India the stephanotis and
the gardenia mingled the dead white of their blossoms with the purple
hibiscus and Java amaryllis

Madame de Morinval seated on the opposite side of the box was dressed
with equal taste and simplicity Morinval a fair and very handsome
young man of elegant appearance was behind the two ladies M de
Montbron was expected to arrive every moment The reader will please
to recollect that the stagebox to the right of the audience opposite
Adriennes had remained till then quite empty The stage represented
one of the gigantic forests of India In the background tall exotic
trees rose in spiral or spreading forms among rugged masses of
perpendicular rocks with here and there glimpses of a tropical sky The
sidescenes formed tufts of trees interspersed with rocks and at the
side which was immediately beneath Adriennes box appeared the irregular
opening of a deep and gloomy cavern round which were heaped huge blocks
of granite as if thrown together by some convulsion of nature This
scenery full of a wild and savage grandeur was wonderfully built up
so as to make the illusion as complete as possible the footlights
were lowered and being covered with a purple shade threw over this
landscape a subdued reddish light which increased the gloomy and
startling effect of the whole Adrienne leaning forward from the box
with cheeks slightly flushed sparkling eyes and throbbing heart
sought to trace in this scene the solitary forest described by the
traveller who had eulogized Djalmas generosity and courage when he
threw himself upon a ferocious tigress to save the life of a poor black
slave Chance coincided wonderfully indeed with her recollections
Absorbed in the contemplation of the scenery and the thoughts it
awakened in her heart she paid no attention to what was passing in the
house And yet something calculated to excite curiosity was taking place
in the opposite stagebox

The door of this box opened A man about forty years of age of a yellow
complexion entered he was clothed after the East Indian fashion in a
long robe of orange silk bound round the waist with a green sash and
he wore a small white turban He placed two chairs at the front of the
box and having glanced round the house for a moment he started his
black eyes sparkled and he went out quickly That man was Faringhea
His apparition caused surprise and curiosity in the theatre the
majority of the spectators not having like Adrienne a thousand reasons
for being absorbed in the contemplation of a picturesque set scene
The public attention was still more excited when they saw the box which
Faringhea had just left entered by a youth of rare beauty also dressed
Oriental fashion in a long robe of white Cashmere with flowing sleeves
with a scarlet turban striped with gold on his head and a sash to
correspond in which was stuck a long dagger glittering with precious
stones This young man was Prince Djalma For an instant he remained
standing at the door and cast a look of indifference upon the immense
theatre crowded with people then stepping forward with a majestic
and tranquil air the prince seated himself negligently on one of the
chairs and turning his head in a few moments towards the entrance
appeared surprised at not seeing some person whom he doubtless expected
This person appeared at length the boxkeeper had been assisting her to
take off her cloak She was a charming fairhaired girl attired
with more show than taste in a dress of white silk with broad
cherrycolored stripes made ultra fashionably low and with short
sleeves a large bow of cherrycolored ribbon was placed on each side
of her light hair and set off the prettiest sprightliest most wilful
little face in the world

It was RosePompon Her pretty arms were partly covered by long white
gloves and ridiculously loaded with bracelets in her hand she carried
an enormous bouquet of roses

Far from imitating the calm demeanor of Djalma RosePompon skipped into
the box moved the chairs about noisily and fidgeted on her seat for
some time to display her fine dress then without being in the least
intimidated by the presence of the brilliant assembly she with a
little coquettish air held her bouquet towards Djalma that he might
smell it and appeared finally to establish herself on her seat
Faringhea came in shut the door of the box and seated himself behind
the prince Adrienne still completely absorbed in the contemplation of
the Indian forest and in her own sweet thoughts had not observed the
newcomers As she was turning her head completely towards the stage and
Djalma could not for the moment see even her profile he on his side
had not recognized Mdlle de Cardoville




CHAPTER XIV DEATH

The pantomime opening by which was introduced the combat of Morok with
the black panther was so unmeaning that the majority of the audience
paid no attention to it reserving all their interest for the scene in
which the liontamer was to make his appearance

This indifference of the public explains the curiosity excited in
the theatre by the arrival of Faringhea and Djalmaa curiosity which
expressed itself as at this day when uncommon foreigners appear in
public by a slight murmur and general movement amongst the crowd The
sprightly pretty face of RosePompon always charming in spite of her
singularly staring dress in style so ridiculous for such a theatre
and her light and familiar manner towards the handsome Indian who
accompanied her increased and animated the general surprise for at
this moment RosePompon yielding without reserve to a movement of
teasing coquetry had held up as we have already stated her large
bunch of roses to Djalma But the prince at sight of the landscape
which reminded him of his country instead of appearing sensible to this
pretty provocation remained for some minutes as in a dream with his
eyes fixed upon the stage Then RosePompon began to beat time on the
front of the box with her bouquet whilst the somewhat too visible
movement of her pretty shoulders showed that this devoted dancer was
thinking of fastlife dances as the orchestra struck up a more lively
strain

Placed directly opposite the box in which Faringhea Djalma and Rose
Pompon had just taken their seats Lady Morinval soon perceived
the arrival of these two personages and particularly the eccentric
coquetries of RosePompon Immediately the young marchioness leaning
over towards Mdlle de Cardoville who was still absorbed in memories
ineffable said to her laughing My dear the most amusing part of the
performance is not upon the stage Look just opposite

Just opposite repeated Adrienne mechanically and turning towards
Lady Morinval with an air of surprise she glanced in the direction
pointed out

She lookedwhat did she seeDjalma seated by the side of a young
woman who was familiarly offering to his sense of smell the perfume
of her bouquet Amazed struck almost literally to the heart as by an
electric shock swift sharp and painful Adrienne became deadly pale
From instinct she shut her eyes for a second in order not to seeas
men try to ward off the dagger which having once dealt the blow
threatens to strike again Then suddenly to this feeling of grief
succeeded a reflection terrible both to her love and to her wounded
pride

Djalma is present with this woman though he must have received my
letter she said to herselfwherein he was informed of the happiness
that awaited him

At the idea of so cruel an insult a blush of shame and indignation
displaced Adriennes paleness who overwhelmed by this sad reality said
to herself Rodin did not deceive me

We abandon all idea of picturing the lightninglike rapidity of certain
emotions which in a moment may torturemay kill you in the space of a
minute Thus Adrienne was precipitated from the most radiant happiness
to the lowest depths of an abyss of the most heartrending grief in
less than a second for a second had hardly elapsed before she replied
to Lady Morinval What is there then so curious opposite to us my
dear Julia

This evasive question gave Adrienne time to recover her selfpossession
Fortunately thanks to the thick folds of hair which almost entirely
concealed her cheeks the rapid and sudden changes from pallor to blush
escaped the notice of Lady Morinval who gayly replied What my dear
do you not perceive those East Indians who have just entered the box
immediately opposite to ours There just before us

Yes I see them but what then replied Adrienne in a firm tone

And dont you observe anything remarkable said the marchioness

Dont be too hard ladies laughingly interposed the marquis we
ought to allow the poor foreigners some little indulgence They are
ignorant of our manners and customs were it not for that they would
never appear in the face of all Paris in such dubious company

Indeed said Adrienne with a bitter smile their simplicity is
touching we must pity them

And unfortunately the girl is charming spite of her low dress and
bare arms said the marchioness she cannot be more than sixteen or
seventeen at most Look at her my dear Adrienne what a pity

It is one of your charitable days my dear Julia answered Adrienne
we are to pity the Indians to pity this creature andpray whom else
are we to pity

We will not pity that handsome Indian in his redandgold turban
said the marquis laughing for if this goes on the girl with the
cherry colored ribbons will be giving him a kiss See how she leans
towards her sultan

They are very amusing said the marchioness sharing the hilarity
of her husband and looking at RosePompom through her glass then she
resumed in about a minute addressing herself to Adrienne I am quite
certain of one thing Notwithstanding her giddy airs that girl is very
fond of her Indian I just saw a look that expresses a great deal

Why so much penetration my dear Julia said Adrienne mildly what
interest have we to read the heart of that girl

Why if she loves her sultan she is quite in the right said the
marquis looking through his operaglass in turn for in my whole
life I never saw a more handsome fellow than that Indian I can only
catch his sideface but the profile is pure and fine as an antique
cameo Do you not think so added the marquis leaning towards
Adrienne Of course it is only as a matter of art that I permit
myself to ask you the question

As a work of art answered Adrienne it is certainly very fine

But see said the marchioness how impertinent the little creature
isShe is actually staring at us

Well said the marquis and she is actually laying her hand quite
unceremoniously on her sultans shoulder to make him share no doubt
in her admiration of you ladies

In fact Djalma until now occupied with the contemplation of the
scene which reminded him of his country had remained insensible to the
enticements of RosePompon and had not yet perceived Adrienne

Well now said RosePompon bustling herself about in front of the
box and continuing to stare at Mdlle de Cardoville for it was she
and not the marchioness who now drew her attention that is something
quite out of the common waya pretty woman with red hair but such
sweet red it must be owned Look Prince Charming

And so saying she tapped Djalma lightly on the shoulder he started at
these words turned round and for the first time perceived Mdlle de
Cardoville

Though he had been almost prepared for this meeting the prince was so
violently affected by it that he was about involuntarily to rise in
a state of the utmost confusion but he felt the iron hand of Faringhea
laid heavily on his shoulder and heard him whisper in Hindostanee
Courage and by tomorrow she will be at your feet

As Djalma still struggled to rise the halfcaste added to restrain him
Just now she grew pale and red with jealousy No weakness or all is
lost

So there you are again talking your dreadful gibberish said Rose
Pompon turning round towards Faringhea First of all it is not
polite and then the language is so odd that one might suppose you were
cracking nuts

I spoke of you to my master said the halfcaste he is preparing a
surprise for you

A surprise oh that is different Only make hastedo you hear Prince
Charming added she looking tenderly at Djalma

My heart is breaking said Djalma in a hollow voice to Faringhea
still using the language of India

But tomorrow it will bound with joy and love answered the
halfcaste It is only by disdain that you can conquer a proud woman
Tomorrow I tell you she will be trembling confused supplicating at
your feet

Tomorrow she will hate me like death replied the prince
mournfully

Yes were she now to see you weak and cowardly It is now too late to
draw back look full at her take the nosegay from this girl and raise
it to your lips Instantly you will see yonder woman proud as she is
grow pale and red as just now Then will you believe me

Reduced by despair to make almost any attempt and fascinated in spite
of himself by the diabolical hints of Faringhea Djalma looked for a
second full at Mdlle de Cardoville then with a trembling hand he took
the bouquet from RosePompon and again looking at Adrienne pressed it
to his lips

Upon this insolent bravado Mdlle de Cardoville could not restrain so
sudden and visible a pang that the prince was struck by it

She is yours said the halfcaste to him Did you see my lord how
she trembled with jealousyOnly have courage and she is yours She
will soon prefer you to that handsome young man behind herfor it is he
whom she has hitherto fancied herself in love with

As if the halfcaste had guessed the movement of rage and hatred which
this revelation would excite in the heart of the prince he hastily
added Calmness and disdain Is it not his turn now to hate you

The prince restrained himself and drew his hand across his forehead
which glowed with anger

There now what are you telling him that vexes him so said Rose
Pompon to Faringhea with pouting lip Then addressing Djalma she
continued Come Prince Charming as they say in the fairytale give
me back my flowers

As she took it again she added You have kissed it and I could almost
eat it Then with a sigh and a passionate glance at Djalma she said
softly to herself That monster Ninny Moulin did not deceive me All
this is quite proper I have not even that to reproach myself with And
with her little white teeth she bit at a rosy nail of her right hand
from which she had just drawn the glove

It is hardly necessary to say that Adriennes letter had not been
delivered to the prince and that he had not gone to pass the day in the
country with Marshal Simon During the three days in which Montbron had
not seen Djalma Faringhea had persuaded him that by affecting another
passion he would bring Mdlle de Cardoville to terms With regard
to Djalmas presence at the theatre Rodin had learned from her maid
Florine that her mistress was to go in the evening to the PorteSaint
Martin Before Djalma had recognized her Adrienne who felt her
strength failing her was on the point of quitting the theatre the man
whom she had hitherto placed so high whom she had regarded as a hero
and a demigod and whom she had imagined plunged in such dreadful
despair that led by the most tender pity she had written to him with
simple frankness that a sweet hope might calm his griefreplied to
a generous mark of sincerity and love by making himself a ridiculous
spectacle with a creature unworthy of him What incurable wounds for
Adriennes pride It mattered little whether Djalma knew or not that
she would be a spectator of the indignity But when she saw herself
recognized by the prince when he carried the insult so far as to look
full at her and at the same time raise to his lips the creatures
bouquet who accompanied him Adrienne was seized with noble indignation
and felt sufficient courage to remain instead of closing her eyes to
evidence she found a sort of barbarous pleasure in assisting at the
agony and death of her pure and divine love With head erect proud and
flashing eye flushed cheek and curling lip she looked in her turn at
the prince with disdainful steadiness It was with a sardonic smile that
she said to the marchioness who like many others of the spectators
was occupied with what was passing in the stagebox This revolting
exhibition of savage manners is at least in accordance with the rest of
the performance

Certainly said the marchioness and my dear uncle will have lost
perhaps the most amusing part

Montbron said Adrienne hastily with hardly repressed bitterness
yes he will regret not having seen all I am impatient for his
arrival Is it not to him that I am indebted for his charming evening

Perhaps Madame de Morinval would have remarked the expression of bitter
irony that Adrienne could not altogether dissemble if suddenly a
hoarse and prolonged roar had net attracted her attention as well
as that of the rest of the audience who had hitherto been quite
indifferent to the scenes intended for an introduction to the appearance
of Morok Every eye was now turned instinctively towards the cavern
situated to the left of the stage just below Mdlle de Cardovilles
box a thrill of curiosity ran through the house A second roar deeper
and more sonorous and apparently expressive of more irritation than
the first now rose from the cave the mouth of which was halfhidden
by artificial brambles made so as to be easily put on one side At this
sound the Englishman stood up in his little box leaned half over the
front and began to rub his hands with great energy then remaining
perfectly motionless he fixed his large green glittering eyes on the
mouth of the cavern

At these ferocious howlings Djalma also had started notwithstanding
the frenzy of love hate and jealousy to which he was a prey The
sight of this forest and the roarings of the panther filled him with
deep emotion for they recalled the remembrance of his country and of
those great hunts which like war have their own terrible excitement
Had he suddenly heard the horns and gongs of his fathers army sounding
to the charge he could not have been transported with more savage
ardor And now deep growls like distant thunder almost drowned the
roar of the panther The lion and tiger Judas and Cain answered her
from their dens at the back of the stage On this frightful concert
with which his ears had been familiar in the midst of the solitudes of
India when he lay encamped for the purposes of the chase or of war
Djalmas blood boiled in his veins His eyes sparkled with a wild ardor
Leaning a little forward with both hands pressed on the front of the
box his whole body trembled with a convulsive shudder The audience
the theatre Adrienne herself no longer existed for him he was in a
forest of his own lands tracking the tiger

Then there mingled with his beauty so intrepid and ferocious an
expression that RosePompon looked at him with a sort of terror and
passionate admiration For the first time in her life perhaps her
pretty blue eyes generally so gay and mischievous expressed a serious
emotion She could not explain what she felt but her heart seemed
frightened and beat violently as though some calamity were at hand

Yielding to a movement of involuntary fear she seized Djalma by the
arm and said to him Do not stare so into that cavern you frighten
me

Djalma did not hear what she said

Here he is here he is murmured the crowd almost with one voice as
Morok appeared at the back of the stage

Dressed as we have described Morok now carried in addition a bow and
a long quiver full of arrows He slowly descended the line of painted
rocks which came sloping down towards the centre of the stage From
time to time he stopped as if to listen and appeared to advance with
caution Looking from one side to the other his eyes involuntarily
encountered the large green eyes of the Englishman whose box was close
to the cavern Instantly the liontamers countenance was contracted in
so frightful a manner that Lady Morinval who was examining him closely
with the aid of an excellent glass said hastily to Adrienne My dear
the man is afraid Some misfortune will happen

How can accidents happen said Adrienne with a sardonic smile
in the midst of this brilliant crowd so well dressed and full of
animation Misfortunes here this evening why dear Julia you do not
think it It is in darkness and solitude that misfortunes comenever in
the midst of a joyous crowd and in all this blaze of light

Good gracious Adrienne take care cried the marchioness unable to
repress an exclamation of alarm and seizing her arm as if to draw her
closer do you not see it And with a trembling hand she pointed to
the caverns mouth Adrienne hastily bent forward and looked in that
direction Take care do not lean so forward exclaimed Lady Morinval

Your terrors are nonsensical my dear said the marquis to his wife
The panther is securely chained and even were it to break its chains
which is impossible we are here beyond its reach

A long murmur of trembling curiosity here ran through the house and
every eye was intently fixed on the cavern From amongst the artificial
brambles which she abruptly pushed aside with her broad chest the
black panther suddenly appeared Twice she stretched forth her flat
head illumined by yellow flaming eyes then halfopening her
bloodred jaws she uttered another roar and exhibited two rows of
formidable fangs A double iron chain and a collar also of iron
painted black blended with the ebon shades of her hide and with the
darkness of the cavern The illusion was complete and the terrible
animal seemed to be at liberty in her den

Ladies said the marquis suddenly look at those Indians Their
emotion makes them superb

In fact the sight of the panther had raised the wild ardor of Djalma
to its utmost pitch His eyes sparkled in their pearly orbits like two
black diamonds his upper lip was curled convulsively with an expression
of animal ferocity as if he were in a violent paroxysm of rage

Faringhea now leaning on the front of the box was also greatly
excited by reason of a strange coincidence That black panther of so
rare a breed thought he which I see here at Paris upon the stage
must be the very one that the Malaythe Thug who had tatooed Djalma
at Java during his sleeptook quite young from his den and sold to a
European captain Bowanees power is everywhere added the Thug in his
sanguinary superstition

Do you not think resumed the marquis addressing Adrienne that
those Indians are really splendid in their present attitude

Perhaps they may have seen such a hunt in their own country said
Adrienne as if she would recall and brave the most cruel remembrances

Adrienne said the marchioness suddenly in an agitated voice the
liontamer has now come neareris not his countenance fearful to look
atI tell you he is afraid

In truth observed the marquis this time very seriously he is
dreadfully pale and seems to grow worse every minute the nearer he
approaches this side It is said that were he to lose his presence of
mind for a single moment he would run the greatest danger

O it would be horrible cried the marchioness addressing Adrienne
if he were woundedthereunder our eyes

Every wound does not kill replied her friend with an accent of such
cold indifference that the marchioness looked at her with surprise and
said to her My dear girl what you say there is cruel

It is the air of the place that acts on me answered Adrienne with an
icy smile

Look look the liontamer is about to shoot his arrow at the panther
said the marquis suddenly No doubt he will next perform the hand to
hand grapple

Morok was at this moment in front of the stage but he had yet to
traverse its entire breadth to reach the caverns mouth He stopped an
instant adjusted an arrow to the string knelt down behind a mass of
rock took deliberate aimand then the arrow hissed across the stage
and was lost in the depths of the cavern into which the panther
had retired after showing for a moment her threatening head to the
audience Hardly had the arrow disappeared than Death purposely
irritated by Goliath who was invisible sent forth a howl of rage as
if she had been really wounded Moroks actions became so expressive
he evinced so naturally his joy at having hit the wild beast that
a tempest of applause burst from every quarter of the house Then
throwing away his bow he drew a dagger from his girdle took it between
his teeth and began to crawl forward on hands and knees as though he
meant to surprise the wounded panther in his den To render the illusion
perfect Death again excited by Goliath who struck him with an iron
bar sent forth frightful howlings from the depths of the cavern

The gloomy aspect of the forest only halflighted with a reddish glare
was so effectivethe howlings of the panther were so furiousthe
gestures attitude and countenance of Morok were so expressive of
terror that the audience attentive and trembling now maintained a
profound silence Every one held his breath and a kind of shudder came
over the spectators as though they expected some horrible event What
gave such a fearful air of truth to the pantomime of Morok was that
as he approached the cavern step by step he approached also the
Englishmans box In spite of himself the liontamer fascinated by
terror could not take his eyes from the large green eyes of this man
and it seemed as if every one of the abrupt movements which he made in
crawling along was produced by a species of magnetic attraction caused
by the fixed gaze of the fatal wagerer Therefore the nearer Morok
approached the more ghastly and livid he became At sight of this
pantomime which was no longer acting but the real expression of
intense fear the deep and trembling silence which had reigned in the
theatre was once more interrupted by acclamations with which were
mingled the roarings of the panther and the distant growls of the lion
and tiger

The Englishman leaned almost out of his box with a frightful sardonic
smile on his lip and with his large eyes still fixed panted for
breath The perspiration ran down his bald red forehead as if he had
really expended an incredible amount of magnetic power in attracting
Morok whom he now saw close to the cavern entrance The moment was
decisive Crouching down with his dagger in his hand following with eye
and gesture Deaths every movement who roaring furiously and opening
wide her enormous jaws seemed determined to guard the entrance of
her den Morok waited for the moment to rush upon her There is such
fascination in danger that Adrienne shared in spite of herself the
feeling of painful curiosity mixed with terror that thrilled through
all the spectators Leaning forward like the marchioness and gazing
upon this scene of fearful interest the lady still held mechanically in
her hand the Indian bouquet preserved since the morning Suddenly
Morok raised a wild shout as he rushed towards Death who answered this
exclamation by a dreadful roar and threw herself upon her master with
so much fury that Adrienne in alarm believing the man lost drew
herself back and covered her fact with her hands Her flowers slipped
from her grasp and falling upon the stage rolled into the cavern in
which Morok was struggling with the panther

Quick as lightning supple and agile as a tiger yielding to the
intoxication of his love and to the wild ardor excited in him by the
roaring of the panther Djalma sprang at one bound upon the stage drew
his dagger and rushed into the cavern to recover Adriennes nosegay At
that instant Morok being wounded uttered a dreadful cry for help the
panther rendered still more furious at sight of Djalma make the most
desperate efforts to break her chain Unable to succeed in doing so she
rose upon her hind legs in order to seize Djalma then within reach of
her sharp claws It was only by bending down his head throwing himself
on his knees and twice plunging his dagger into her belly with the
rapidity of lightning that Djalma escaped certain death The panther
gave a howl and fell with her whole weight upon the prince For a
second during which lasted her terrible agony nothing was seen but a
confused and convulsive mass of black limbs and white garments
stained with bloodand then Djalma rose pale bleeding for he was
woundedand standing erect his eye flashing with savage pride his
foot on the body of the panther he held in his hand Adriennes bouquet
and cast towards her a glance which told the intensity of his love
Then only did Adrienne feel her strength fail herfor only superhuman
courage had enabled her to watch all the terrible incidents of the
struggle

CHAPTER XV THE CONSTANT WANDERER

It is night The moon shines and the stars glimmer in the midst of a
serene but cheerless sky the sharp whistlings of the north wind that
fatal dry and icy breeze ever and anon burst forth in violent gusts
With its harsh and cutting breath it sweeps Montmartres Heights On
the highest point of the hills a man is standing His long shadow is
cast upon the stony moonlit ground He gazes on the immense city
which lies outspread beneath his feet PARISwith the dark outline of
its towers cupolas domes and steeples standing out from the limpid
blue of the horizon while from the midst of the ocean of masonry rises
a luminous vapor that reddens the starry azure of the sky It is the
distant reflection of the thousand fires which at night the hour of
pleasures light up so joyously the noisy capital

No said the wayfarer it is not to be The Lord will not exact it
Is not twice enough

Five centuries ago the avenging hand of the Almighty drove me hither
from the uttermost confines of Asia A solitary traveller I had left
behind me more grief despair disaster and death than the innumerable
armies of a hundred devastating conquerors I entered this town and it
too was decimated

Again two centuries ago the inexorable hand which leads me through
the world brought me once more hither and then as the time before
the plague which the Almighty attaches to my steps again ravaged this
city and fell first on my brethren already worn out with labor and
misery

My brethrenminethe cobbler of Jerusalem the artisan accursed by
the Lord who in my person condemned the whole race of workmen
ever suffering ever disinherited ever in slavery toiling on like me
without rest or pause without recompense or hope till men women
and children young and old all die beneath the same iron yokethat
murderous yoke which others take in their turn thus to be borne from
age to age on the submissive and bruised shoulders of the masses

And now for the third time in five centuries I reach the summit of
one of the hills that overlook the city And perhaps I again bring with
me fear desolation and death

Yet this city intoxicated with the sounds of its joys and its
nocturnal revelries does not knowoh does not know that I am at its
gates

But no no my presence will not be a new calamity The Lord in his
impenetrable views has hitherto led me through France so as to
avoid the humblest hamlet and the sound of the funeral knell has not
accompanied my passage

And moreover the spectre has left methe green livid spectre with
its hollow bloodshot eyes When I touched the soil of France its damp
and icy hands was no longer clasped in mineand it disappeared

And yetI feel that the atmosphere of death is around me

The sharp whistlings of that fatal wind cease not which catching me
in their whirl seem to propagate blasting and mildew as they blow

But perhaps the wrath of the Lord is appeased and my presence here is
only a threatto be communicated in some way to those whom it should
intimidate

Yes for otherwise he would smite with a fearful blow by first
scattering terror and death here in the heart of the country in the
bosom of this immense city

Oh no no the Lord will be merciful No he will not condemn me to
this new torture

Alas in this city my brethren are more numerous and miserable than
elsewhere And should I be their messenger of death

No the Lord will have pity For alas the seven descendants of my
sister have at length met in this town And to them likewise should I be
the messenger of death instead of the help they so much need

For that woman who like me wanders from one border of the earth to the
other after having once more rent asunder the nets of their enemies
has gone forth upon her endless journey

In vain she foresaw that new misfortunes threatened my sisters family
The invisible hand that drives me on drives her on also

Carried away as of old by the irresistible whirlwind at the moment
of leaving my kindred to their fate she in vain cried with supplicating
tone Let me at least O Lord complete my taskGO ONA few
days in mercy only a few poor daysGO ONI leave those I love
on the brink of the abyssGO ON GO ON

And the wandering staragain started on its eternal round And her
voice passing through space called me to the assistance of mine own

When that voice readied me I knew that the descendants of my sister
were still exposed to frightful perils Those perils are even now on the
increase

Tell me O Lord will they escape the scourge which for so many
centuries has weighed down our race

Wilt thou pardon me in them wilt thou punish me in them Oh that they
might obey the last will of their ancestor

Oh that they might join together their charitable hearts their valor
and their strength their noble intelligence and their great riches

They would then labor for the future happiness of humanitythey would
thus perhaps redeem me from my eternal punishment

The words of the Son of Man LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER will be their only
end their only means

By the help of those allpowerful words they will fight and conquer
the false priests who have renounced the precepts of love peace and
hope for lessons of hatred violence and despair

Those false priests who kept in pay by the powerful and happy of this
world their accomplices in every age instead of asking here below for
some slight share of wellbeing for my unfortunate brethren dare in
thy name O Lord God to assert that the poor are condemned to endless
suffering in this worldand that the desire or the hope to suffer less
is a crime in thine eyesbecause the happiness of the few and the
misery of nearly the whole human race is O blasphemy according to
thy will Is not the very contrary of those murderous words alone worthy
of divinity

In mercy hear me Lord Rescue from their enemies the descendants of
my sisterthe artisan as the kings son Do not let them destroy the
germ of so mighty and fruitful an association which with thy blessing
would make an epoch in the annals of human happiness

Let me unite them O Lord since others would divide themdefend them
since others attack let me give hope to those who have ceased to hope
courage to those who are brought low with fearlet me raise up the
falling and sustain those who persevere in the way of the righteous

And peradventure their struggles devotion virtue and grief may
expiate my faultthat of a man whom misfortune alone rendered unjust
and wicked

Oh since Thy Almighty hand hath led me hitherto what end I know
notlay aside Thy wrath I beseech Theelet me be no longer the
instrument of Thy vengeance

Enough of woe upon the earth for the last two years Thy creatures
have fallen by thousands upon my track The world is decimated A veil
of mourning extends over all the globe

From Asia to the icy Pole they died upon the path of the wanderer
Dost Thou not hear the longdrawn sigh that rises from the earth unto
Thee O Lord

Mercy for all mercy for meLet me but unite the descendants of my
sister for a single day and they will be saved

As he pronounced these words the wayfarer sank upon his knees and
raised to heaven his supplicating hands Suddenly the wind blew with
redoubled violence its sharp whistlings were changed into the roar of a
tempest

The traveller shuddered in a voice of terror he exclaimed The blast
of death rises in its furythe whirlwind carries me onLord Thou art
then deaf to my prayer

The spectre oh the spectre it is again here its green face
twitching with convulsive spasmsits red eyes rolling in their orbits
Begone begoneits hand oh its icy hand has again laid hold of mine
Have mercy heaven

GO ON

Oh Lord the pestilencethe terrible plaguemust I carry it into
this cityAnd my brethren will perish the firstthey who are so
sorely smitten even now Mercy

GO ON

And the descendants of my sister Mercy Mercy

GO ON

Oh Lord have pityI can no longer keep my ground the spectre drags
me to the slope of the hill my walk is rapid as the deadly blast that
rages behind me already do I behold the city gates Have mercy Lord
on the descendants of my sister Spare them do not make me their
executioner let them triumph over their enemies

GO ON GO ON

The ground flies beneath my feet there is the city gate Lord it is
yet time Oh mercy for that sleeping town Let it not waken to cries
of terror despair and death Lord I am on the threshold Must it
beYes it is done Paris the plague is in thy bosom The curseoh
the eternal curse

GO ON GO ON GO ON




CHAPTER XVI THE LUNCHEON

The morning after the doomed traveller descending the heights of
Montmartre had entered the walls of Paris great activity reigned in
St Dizier House Though it was hardly noon the Princess de St Dizier
without being exactly in full dress she had too much taste for that
was yet arrayed with more care than usual Her light hair instead of
being merely banded was arranged in two bunches of curls which suited
very well with her full and florid cheeks Her cap was trimmed with
bright rosecolored ribbon and whoever had seen the lady in her tight
fitting dress of graywatered silk would have easily guessed that
Mrs Grivois her tirewoman must have required the assistance and the
efforts of another of the princesss women to achieve so remarkable a
reduction in the ample figure of their mistress

We shall explain the edifying cause of this partial return to the
vanities of the world The princess attended by Mrs Grivois who
acted as housekeeper was giving her final orders with regard to some
preparations that were going on in a vast parlor In the midst of this
room was a large round table covered with crimson velvet and near it
stood several chairs amongst which in the place of honor was an arm
chair of gilded wood In one corner not far from the chimney in which
burned an excellent fire was a buffet On it were the divers materials
for a most dainty and exquisite collation Upon silver dishes were piled
pyramids of sandwiches composed of the roes of carp and anchovy paste
with slices of pickled tunnyfish and Lenigord truffles it was in
Lent on silver dishes placed over burning spirits of wine so as to
keep them very hot tails of Meuse crawfish boiled in cream smoked in
golden colored pastry and seemed to challenge comparison with delicious
little Marennes oysterpatties stewed in Madeira and flavored with a
seasoning of spiced sturgeon By the side of these substantial
dishes were some of a lighter character such as pineapple tarts
strawberrycreams it was early for such fruit and orangejelly served
in the peel which had been artistically emptied for that purpose
Bordeaux Madeira and Alicant sparkled like rubies and topazes in large
glass decanters while two Sevres ewers were filled one with coffee
a la creme the other with vanilla chocolate almost in the state of
sherbet from being plunged in a large cooler of chiselled silver
containing ice

But what gave to this dainty collation a singularly apostolic and
papal character were sundry symbols of religious worship carefully
represented Thus there were charming little Calvaries in apricot paste
sacerdotal mitres in burnt almonds episcopal croziers in sweet cake
to which the princess added as a mark of delicate attention a little
cardinals hat in cherry sweetmeat ornamented with bands in burnt
sugar The most important however of these Catholic delicacies the
masterpiece of the cook was a superb crucifix in angelica with a crown
of candied berries These are strange profanations which scandalize
even the least devout But from the impudent juggle of the coat of
Triers down to the shameless jest of the shrine at Argenteuil people
who are pious after the fashion of the princess seem to take delight in
bringing ridicule upon the most respectable traditions

After glancing with an air of satisfaction at these preparations for the
collation the lady said to Mrs Grivois as she pointed to the gilded
armchair which seemed destined for the president of the meeting Is
there a cushion under the table for his Eminence to rest his feet on
He always complains of cold

Yes your highness said Mrs Grivois when she had looked under the
table the cushion is there

Let also a pewter bottle be filled with boiling water in case his
Eminence should not find the cushion enough to keep his feet warm

Yes my lady

And put some more wood on the fire

But my lady it is already a very furnace And if his Eminence is
always too cold my lord the Bishop of Halfagen is always too hot He
perspires dreadfully

The princess shrugged her shoulders and said to Mrs Grivois Is not
his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri the superior of his Lordship the Bishop
of Halfagen

Yes your highness

Then according to the rules of the hierarchy it is for his Lordship
to suffer from the heat rather than his Eminence from the cold
Therefore do as I tell you and put more wood on the fire Nothing is
more natural his Eminence being an Italian and his Lordship
coming from the north of Belgium they are accustomed to different
temperatures

Just as your highness pleases said Mrs Grivois as she placed two
enormous logs on the fire but in such a heat as there is here his
Lordship might really be suffocated

I also find it too warm but does not our holy religion teach us
lessons of selfsacrifice and mortification said the princess with a
touching expression of devotion

We have now explained the cause of the rather gay attire of the
princess She was preparing for a reception of prelates who along with
Father dAigrigny and other dignitaries of the Church had already held
at the princely house a sort of council on a small scale A young bride
who gives her first ball an emancipated minor who gives his first
bachelors dinner a woman of talent who reads aloud for the first time
her first unpublished work are not more joyous and proud and at the
same time more attentive to their guests than was this lady with her
prelates To behold great interests discussed in her house and in
her presence to hear men of acknowledged ability ask her advice
upon certain practical matters relating to the influence of female
congregations filled the princess with pride as her claims to
consideration were thus sanctioned by Lordships and Eminences and she
took the position as it were of a mother of the Church Therefore to
win these prelates whether native or foreign she had recourse to no
end of saintly flatteries and sanctified coaxing Nor could anything be
more logical than these successive transfigurations of this heartless
woman who only loved sincerely and passionately the pursuit of intrigue
and domination With the progress of age she passed naturally from the
intrigues of love to those of politics and from the latter to those of
religion

At the moment she finished inspecting her preparations the sound of
coaches was heard in the courtyard apprising her of the arrival of the
persons she had been expecting Doubtless these persons were of the
highest rank for contrary to all custom she went to receive them at
the door of her outer saloon It was indeed Cardinal Malipieri who
was always cold with the Belgian Bishop of Halfagen who was always
hot They were accompanied by Father dAigrigny The Roman cardinal was
a tall man rather bony than thin with a yellowish puffy countenance
haughty and full of craft he squinted a good deal and his black eyes
were surrounded by a deep brown circle The Belgian Bishop was short
thick and fat with a prominent abdomen an apoplectic complexion a
slow deliberate look and a soft dimpled delicate hand

The company soon assembled in the great saloon The cardinal instantly
crept close to the fire whilst the bishop beginning to sweat and blow
cast longing glances at the iced chocolate and coffee which were to aid
him in sustaining the oppressive heat of the artificial dogday Father
dAigrigny approaching the princess said to her in a low voice Will
you give orders for the admittance of Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont when he
arrives

Is that young priest then here asked the princess with extreme
surprise

Since the day before yesterday We had him sent for to Paris by his
superiors You shall know all As for Father Rodin let Mrs Grivois
admit him as the other day by the little door of the back stairs

He will come today

He has very important matters to communicate He desires that both the
cardinal and the bishop should be present for they have been informed
of everything at Rome by the Superior General in their quality of
associates

The princess rang the bell gave the necessary orders and returning
towards the cardinal said to him in a tone of the most earnest
solicitude Does your Eminence begin to feel a little warmer Would
your Eminence like a bottle of hot water to your feet Shall we make a
larger fire for your Eminence

At this proposition the Belgian bishop who was wiping the perspiration
from his forehead heaved a despairing sigh

A thousand thanks princess answered the cardinal to her in very
good French but with an intolerable Italian accent I am really
overcome with so much kindness

Will not your Lordship take some refreshment said the princess to the
bishop as she turned towards the sideboard

With your permission madame I will take a little iced coffee said
the prelate making a prudent circuit to approach the dishes without
passing before the fire

And will not your Eminence try one of these little oysterpatties They
are quite hot said the princess

I know them already princess said the cardinal with the air
and look of an epicure they are delicious and I cannot resist the
temptation

What wine shall I have the honor to offer your Eminence resumed the
princess graciously

A little claret if you please madame and as Father dAigrigny
prepared to fill the cardinals glass the princess disputed with him
that pleasure

Your Eminence will doubtless approve what I have done said Father
dAigrigny to the cardinal whilst the latter was gravely despatching
the oysterpatties in not summoning for today the Bishop of
Mogador the Archbishop of Nanterre and our holy Mother Perpetue the
ladysuperior of St Mary Convent the interview we are about to have
with his Reverence Father Rodin and Abbe Gabriel being altogether
private and confidential

Our good father was perfectly right said the cardinal for though
the possible consequences of this Rennepont affair may interest the
whole Church there are some things that are as well kept secret

Then I must seize this opportunity to thank your Eminence for having
deigned to make an exception in favor of a very obscure and humble
servant of the Church said the princess to the cardinal with a very
deep and respectful curtsey

It is only just and right madame replied the cardinal bowing as he
replaced his empty glass upon the table we know how much the Church
is indebted to you for the salutary direction you give to the religious
institutions of which you are the patroness

With regard to that your Eminence may be assured that I always refuse
assistance to any poor person who cannot produce a certificate from the
confessional

And it is only thus madame resumed the cardinal this time allowing
himself to be tempted by the attractions of the crawfishs tails it
is only thus that charity has any meaning I care little that the
irreligious should feel hunger but with the pious it is different and
the prelate gayly swallowed a mouthful Moreover resumed he it is
well known with what ardent zeal you pursue the impious and those who
are rebels against the authority of our Holy Father

Your Eminence may feel convinced that I am Roman in heart and soul
I see no difference between a Gallican and a Turk said the princess
bravely

The princess is right said the Belgian bishop I will go further
and assert that a Gallican should be more odious to the church than a
pagan In this respect I am of the opinion of Louis XIV They asked him
a favor for a man about the court Never said the great king this
person is a JansenistNo sire he is an atheistOh that is
different I will grant what he asks said the King

This little episcopal jest made them all laugh After which Father
dAigrigny resumed seriously addressing the cardinal Unfortunately
as I was about to observe to your Eminence with regard to the Abbe
Gabriel unless they are very narrowly watched the lower clergy have
a tendency to become infected with dissenting views and with ideas of
rebellion against what they call the despotism of the bishops

This young man must be a Catholic Luther said the bishop And
walking on tiptoe he went to pour himself out a glorious glass of
Madeira in which he soaked some sweet cake made in the form of a
crozier

Led by his example the Cardinal under pretence of warming his feet by
drawing still closer to the fire helped himself to an excellent glass
of old Malaga which he swallowed by mouthfuls with an air of profound
meditation after which he resumed So this Abbe Gabriel starts as a
reformer He must be an ambitious man Is he dangerous

By our advice his superiors have judged him to be so They have ordered
him to come hither He will soon be here and I will tell your Eminence
why I have sent for him But first I have a note on the dangerous
tendencies of the Abbe Gabriel Certain questions were addressed to
him with regard to some of his acts and it was in consequence of his
answers that his superiors recalled him

So saying Father dAigrigny took from his pocketbook a paper which
he read as follows

QuestionIs it true that you performed religious rites for an
inhabitant of your parish who died in final impenitence of the most
detestable kind since he had committed suicide

Answer of Abbe GabrielI paid him the last duties because more
than any one else because of his guilty end he required the prayers of
the church During the night which followed his interment I continually
implored for him the divine mercy

QIs it true that you refused a set of silvergilt sacramental
vessels and other ornaments with which one of the faithful in pious
zeal wished to endow your parish

AI refused the vessels and embellishments because the house of the
Lord should be plain and without ornament so as to remind the faithful
that the divine Saviour was born in a stable I advised the person who
wished to make these useless presents to my parish to employ the money
in judicious almsgiving assuring him it would be more agreeable to the
Lord

What a bitter and violent declamation against the adorning of our
temples cried the cardinal This young priest is most dangerous
Continue my good father

And in his indignation his Eminence swallowed several mouthfuls of
strawberrycream Father dAigrigny continued

QIs it true that you received in your parsonage and kept there for
some days an inhabitant of the village by birth a Swiss belonging to
the Protestant communion Is it true that not only you did not attempt
to convert him to the one Catholic and Apostolic faith but that you
carried so far the neglect of your sacred duties as to inter this
heretic in the ground consecrated for the repose of true believers

AOne of my brethren was houseless His life had been honest and
laborious In his old age his strength had failed him and sickness had
come at the back of it almost in a dying state he had been driven from
his humble dwelling by a pitiless landlord to whom he owed a years
rent I received the old man in my house and soothed his last days The
poor creature had toiled and suffered all his life dying he uttered no
word of bitterness at his hard fate he recommended his soul to God and
piously kissed the crucifix His pure and simple spirit returned to the
bosom of its Creator I closed his eyes with respect I buried him I
prayed for him and though he died in the Protestant faith I thought
him worthy of a place in consecrated ground

Worse and worse said the cardinal This tolerance is monstrous It
is a horrible attack on that maxim of Catholicism Out of the pale of
the Church there is no salvation

And all this is the more serious my lord resumed Father dAigrigny
because the mildness charity and Christian devotion of Abbe Gabriel
have excited not only in his parish but in all the surrounding
districts the greatest enthusiasm The priests of the neighboring
parishes have yielded to the general impulse and it must be confessed
that but for his moderation a widespread schism would have commenced

But what do you hope will result from bringing him here said the
prelate

The position of Abbe Gabriel is complicated first of all he is the
heir of the Rennepont family

But has he not ceded his rights asked the cardinal

Yes my lord and this cession which was at first informal has
lately with his free consent been made perfectly regular in law for
he had sworn happen what might to renounce his part of the inheritance
in favor of the Society of Jesus Nevertheless his Reverence Father
Rodin thinks that if your Eminence after explaining to Abbe Gabriel
that he was about to be recalled by his superiors were to propose to
him some eminent position at Rome he might be induced to leave France
and we might succeed in arousing within him those sentiments of ambition
which are doubtless only sleeping for the present your Eminence having
observed very judiciously that every reformer must be ambitious

I approve of this idea said the cardinal after a moments
reflection with his merit and power of acting on other men Abbe
Gabriel may rise very high if he is docile and if he should not be so
it is better for the safety of the Church that he should be at Rome
than herefor you know my good father we have securities that are
unfortunately wanting in France36

After some moments of silence the cardinal said suddenly to Father
dAigrigny As we were talking of Father Rodin tell me frankly what
you think of him

Your Eminence knows his capacity said Father dAigrigny with a
constrained and suspicious air our reverend FatherGeneral

Commissioned him to take your place said the cardinal I know that
He told me so at Rome But what do you think of the character of Father
Rodin Can one have full confidence in him

He has so complete so original so secret and so impenetrable a
mind said Father dAigrigny with hesitation that it is difficult to
form any certain judgment with respect to him

Do you think him ambitious said the cardinal after another moments
pause Do you not suppose him capable of having other views than those
of the greater glory of his OrderCome I have reasons for speaking
thus added the prelate with emphasis

Why resumed Father dAigrigny not without suspicion for the game
is played cautiously between people of the same craft what should your
Eminence think of him either from your own observation or from the
report of the FatherGeneral

I thinkthat if his apparent devotion to his Order really concealed
some afterthoughtit would be well to discover itfor with the
influence that he has obtained at Rome as I have found out he might
one day and that shortly become very formidable

Well cried Father dAigrigny impelled by his jealousy of Rodin I
am in this respect of the same opinion as your Eminence for I have
sometimes perceived in him flashes of ambition that were as alarming as
they were extraordinaryand since I must tell all to your Eminence

Father dAigrigny was unable to continue at this moment Mrs Grivois
who had been knocking at the door halfopened it and made a sign to
her mistress The princess answered by bowing her head and Mrs Grivois
again withdrew A second afterwards Rodin entered the room

36 It is known that in 1845 the Inquisition solitary confinement
etc still existed at Rome




CHAPTER XVII RENDERING THE ACCOUNT

At sight of Rodin the two prelates and Father dAigrigny rose
spontaneously so much were they overawed by the real superiority
of this man their faces just before contracted with suspicion and
jealousy suddenly brightened up and seemed to smile on the reverend
father with affectionate deference The princess advanced some steps to
meet him

Rodin badly dressed as ever leaving on the soft carpet the muddy track
of his clumsy shoes put his umbrella into one corner and advanced
towards the tablenot with his accustomed humility but with slow step
uplifted head and steady glance not only did he feel himself in the
midst of his partisans but he knew that he could rule them all by the
power of his intellect

We were speaking of your reverence my dear good father said the
cardinal with charming affability

Ah said Rodin looking fixedly at the prelate and what were you
saying

Why replied the Belgian bishop wiping his forehead all the good
that can be said of your reverence

Will you not take something my good father said the princess to
Rodin as she pointed to the splendid sideboard

Thank you madame I have eaten my radish already this morning

My secretary Abbe Berlini who was present at your repast was
indeed much astonished at your reverences frugality said the
prelate it is worthy of an anchorite

Suppose we talk of business said Rodin abruptly like a man
accustomed to lead and control the discussion

We shall always be most happy to hear you said the prelate Your
reverence yourself fixed today to talk over this great Rennepont
affair It is of such importance that it was partly the cause of my
journey to France for to support the interests of the glorious Company
of Jesus with which I have the honor of being associated is to support
the interests of Rome itself and I promised the reverend FatherGeneral
that I would place myself entirely at your orders

I can only repeat what his Eminence has just said added the bishop
We set out from Rome together and our ideas are just the same

Certainly said Rodin addressing the cardinal your Eminence may
serve our cause and that materially I will tell you how presently

Then addressing the princess he continued I have desired Dr
Baleinier to come here madame for it will be well to inform him of
certain things

He will be admitted as usual said the princess

Since Rodins arrival Father dAigrigny had remained silent he seemed
occupied with bitter thoughts and with some violent internal struggle
At last half rising he said to the prelate in a forced tone of voice
I will not ask your Eminence to judge between the reverend Father Rodin
and myself Our General has pronounced and I have obeyed But as your
Eminence will soon see our superior I should wish that you would grant
me the favor to report faithfully the answers of Father Rodin to one or
two questions I am about to put to him

The prelate bowed Rodin looked at Father dAigrigny with an air of
surprise and said to him dryly The thing is decided What is the use
of questions

Not to justify myself answered Father dAigrigny but to place
matters in their true light before his Eminence

Speak then but let us have no useless speeches said Rodin drawing
out his large silver watch and looking at it By two oclock I must be
at SaintSulpice

I will be as brief as possible said Father dAigrigny with repressed
resentment Then addressing Rodin he resumed When your reverence
thought fit to take my place and to blame very severely perhaps
the manner in which I had managed the interests confided to my care I
confess honestly that these interests were gravely compromised

Compromised said Rodin ironically you mean lost Did you not order
me to write to Rome to bid them renounce all hope

That is true said Father dAigrigny

It was then a desperate case given up by the best doctors continued
Rodin with irony and yet I have undertaken to restore it to life Go
on

And plunging both hands into the pockets of his trousers he looked
Father dAigrigny full in the face

Your reverence blamed me harshly resumed Father dAigrigny not for
having sought by every possible means to recover the property odiously
diverted from our society

All your casuists authorize you to do so said the cardinal the
texts are clear and positive you have a right to recover per fas aut
nefas what has been treacherously taken from you

And therefore resumed Father dAigrigny Father Rodin only
reproached me with the military roughness of my means Their violence
he said was in dangerous opposition to the manners of the age Be it
so but first of all I could not be exposed to any legal proceedings
and but for one fatal circumstance success would have crowned the
course I had taken however rough and brutal it may appear Now may I
ask your reverence what

What I have done more than you said Rodin to Father dAigrigny
giving way to his impertinent habit of interrupting people what I have
done better than youwhat step I have taken in the Rennepont affair
since I received it from you in a desperate condition Is that what you
wish to know

Precisely said Father dAigrigny dryly

Well I confess resumed Rodin in a sardonic tone just as you did
great things coarse things turbulent things I have been doing little
puerile secret things Oh heaven you cannot imagine what a foolish
part I who passed for a man of enlarged views have been acting for the
last six weeks

I should never have allowed myself to address such a reproach to your
reverence however deserved it may appear said Father dAigrigny with
a bitter smile

A reproach said Rodin shrugging his shoulders a reproach You
shall be the judge Do you know what I wrote about you some six weeks
ago Here it is Father dAigrigny has excellent qualities He will
be of much service to meand from tomorrow I shall employ you very
actively added Rodin by way of parenthesisbut he is not great
enough to know how to make himself little on occasion Do you
understand

Not very well said Father dAigrigny blushing

So much the worse for you answered Rodin it only proves that I was
right Well since I must tell you I have been wise enough to play the
most foolish part for six whole weeks Yes I have chatted nonsense with
a grisettehave talked of liberty progress humanity emancipation of
women with a young excited girl of Napoleon the Great and all sorts
of Bonapartist idolatry with an old imbecile soldier of imperial
glory humiliation of France hopes in the King of Rome with a certain
marshal of France who with a heart full of adoration for the robber of
thrones that was transported to SaintHelena has a head as hollow and
sonorous as a trumpet into which you have only to blow some warlike or
patriotic notes and it will flourish away of itself without knowing
why or how More than all this I have talked of love affairs with
a young tiger When I told you it was lamentable to see a man of
any intelligence descend as I have done to all such petty ways of
connecting the thousand threads of this dark web was I not right Is it
not a fine spectacle to see the spider obstinately weaving its netto
see the ugly little black animal crossing thread upon thread fastening
it here strengthening it there and again lengthening it in some
other place You shrug your shoulders in pity but return two hours
afterwhat will you find The little black animal eating its fill and
in its web a dozen of the foolish flies bound so securely that the
little black animal has only to choose the moment of its repast

As he uttered those words Rodin smiled strangely his eyes gradually
half closed opened to their full width and seemed to shine more
than usual The Jesuit felt a sort of feverish excitement which he
attributed to the contest in which he had engaged before these eminent
personages who already felt the influence of his original and cutting
speech

Father dAigrigny began to regret having entered on the contest He
resumed however with illrepressed irony I do not dispute the
smallness of your means I agree with you they are very puerilethey
are even very vulgar But that is not quite sufficient to give an
exalted notion of your merit May I be allowed to ask

What these means have produced resumed Rodin with an excitement that
was not usual with him Look into my spiders web and you will see
there the beautiful and insolent young girl so proud six weeks ago of
her grace mind and audacitynow pale trembling mortally wounded at
the heart

But the act of chivalrous intrepidity of the Indian prince with which
all Paris is ringing said the princess must surely have touched
Mdlle de Cardoville

Yes but I have paralyzed the effect of that stupid and savage
devotion by demonstrating to the young lady that it is not sufficient
to kill black panthers to prove ones self a susceptible delicate and
faithful lover

Be it so said Father dAigrigny we will admit the fact that Mdlle
de Cardoville is wounded to the heart

But what does this prove with regard to the Rennepont affair asked
the cardinal with curiosity as he leaned his elbows on the table

There results from it said Rodin that when our most dangerous enemy
is mortally wounded she abandons the battlefield That is something I
should imagine

Indeed said the princess the talents and audacity of Mdlle de
Cardoville would make her the soul of the coalition formed against us

Be it so replied Father dAigrigny obstinately she may be no
longer formidable in that respect But the wound in her heart will not
prevent her from inheriting

Who tells you so asked Rodin coldly and with assurance Do you
know why I have taken such pains first to bring her in contact with
Djalma and then to separate her from him

That is what I ask you said Father DAigrigny how can this storm of
passion prevent Mdlle de Cardoville and the prince from inheriting

Is it from the serene or from the stormy sky that darts the
destroying thunderbolt said Rodin disdainfully Be satisfied I
shall know where to place the conductor As for M Hardy the man lived
for three things his workmen his friend his mistress He has been
thrice wounded in the heart I always take aim at the heart it is legal
and sure

It is legal and sure and praiseworthy said the bishop for if
I understand you rightly this manufacturer had a concubine now it is
well to make use of an evil passion for the punishment of the wicked

True quite true added the cardinal if they have evil passion for
us to make use of it it is their own fault

Our holy Mother Perpetue said the princess took every means to
discover this abominable adultery

Well then M Hardy is wounded in his dearest affections I admit
said Father dAigrigny still disputing every inch of ground ruined
too in his fortune which will only make him the more eager after this
inheritance

The argument appeared of weight to the two prelates and the princess
all looked at Rodin with anxious curiosity Instead of answering he
walked up to the sideboard and contrary to his habits of stoical
sobriety and in spite of his repugnance for wine he examined the
decanters and said What is there in them

Claret and sherry said the hostess much astonished at the sudden
taste of Rodin and

The latter took a decanter at hazard and poured out a glass of Madeira
which he drank off at a draught Just be fore he had felt a strange kind
of shivering to this had succeeded a sort of weakness He hoped the
wine would revive him

After wiping his mouth with the back of his dirty hand he returned to
the table and said to Father dAigrigny What did you tell me about M
Hardy

That being ruined in fortune he would be the more eager to obtain this
immense inheritance answered Father dAigrigny inwardly much offended
at the imperious tone

M Hardy think of money said Rodin shrugging his shoulders He is
indifferent to life plunged in a stupor from which he only starts to
burst into tears Then he speaks with mechanical kindness to those about
him I have placed him in good hands He begins however to be sensible
to the attentions shown him for he is good excellent weak and ii is
to this excellence Father dAigrigny that you must appeal to finish
the work in hand

I said Father dAigrigny much surprised

Yes and then you will find that the result I have obtained is
considerable and

Rodin paused and pressing his hand to his forehead said to himself
It is strange

What is the matter said the princess with interest

Nothing madame answered Rodin with a shiver it is doubtless the
wine I drank I am not accustomed to it I feel a slight headache but
it will pass

Your eyes are very bloodshot my good father said the princess

I have looked too closely into my web answered the Jesuit with a
sinister smile and I must look again to make Father dAigrigny
who pretends to be blind catch a glimpse of my other flies The two
daughters of Marshal Simon for instance growing sadder and more
dejected every day at the icy barrier raised between them and their
father and the latter thinking himself one day dishonored if he does
this another if he does that so that the hero of the Empire has become
weaker and more irresolute than a child What more remains of this
impious family Jacques Rennepont Ask Morok to what a state of
debasement intemperance has reduced him and towards what an abyss he is
rushingThere is my occurrencesheet you see to what are reduced all
the members of this family who six weeks ago had each elements of
strength and union Behold these Renneponts who by the will of their
heretical ancestor were to unite their forces to combat and crush our
SocietyThere was good reason to fear them but what did I say That I
would act upon their passions What have I done I have acted upon their
passions At this hour they are vainly struggling in my webthey are
minethey are mine

As he was speaking Rodins countenance and voice had undergone a
singular alteration his complexion generally so cadaverous had become
flushed but unequally and in patches then strange phenomenon his
eyes grew both more brilliant and more sunken and his voice sharper
and louder The change in the countenance of Rodin of which he did not
appear to be conscious was so remarkable that the other actors in this
scene looked at him with a sort of terror

Deceived as to the cause of this impression Rodin exclaimed with
indignation in a voice interrupted by deep gaspings for breath It is
pity for this impious race that I read upon your faces Pity for the
young girl who never enters a church and erects pagan altars in
her habitation Pity for Hardy the sentimental blasphemer the
philanthropic atheist who had no chapel in his factory and dared
to blend the names of Socrates Marcus Aurelius and Plato with our
Saviors Pity for the Indian worshipper of Brahma Pity for the two
sisters who have never even been baptized Pity for that brute Jacques
Rennepont Pity for the stupid imperial soldier who has Napoleon for
his god and the bulletins of the Grand Army for his gospel Pity
for this family of renegades whose ancestor a relapsed heretic not
content with robbing us of our property excites from his tomb at the
end of a century and a half his cursed race to lift their heads against
us What to defend ourselves from these vipers we shall not have the
right to crush them in their own venomI tell you that it is to
serve heaven and to give a salutary example to the world to devote by
unchaining their own passions this impious family to grief and despair
and death

As he spoke thus Rodin was dreadful in his ferocity the fire of his
eyes became still more brilliant his lips were dry and burning a cold
sweat bathed his temples which could be seen throbbing an icy shudder
ran through his frame Attributing these symptoms to fatigue from
writing through a portion of the night and wishing to avoid fainting
he went to the sideboard filled another glass with wine which he drank
off at a draught and returned as the cardinal said to him If your
course with regard to this family needed justification my good father
your last word would have victoriously justified it Not only are you
right according to your own casuists but there is nothing in your
proceedings contrary to human laws As for the divine law it is
pleasing to the Lord to destroy impiety with its own weapons

Conquered as well as the others by Rodins diabolical assurance and
brought back to a kind of fearful admiration Father dAigrigny said to
him I confess I was wrong in doubting the judgment of your reverence
Deceived by the appearance of the means employed I could not judge
of their connection and above all of their results I now see that
thanks to you success is no longer doubtful

This is an exaggeration replied Rodin with feverish impatience all
these passions are at work but the moment is critical As the alchemist
bends over the crucible which may give him either treasures or sudden
deathI alone at this moment

Rodin did not finish the sentence He pressed both his hands to his
forehead with a stifled cry of pain

What is the matter said Father dAigrigny For some moments you have
been growing fearfully pale

I do not know what is the matter said Rodin in an altered voice
my headache increasesI am seized with a sort of giddiness

Sit down said the princess with interest

Take something said the bishop

It will be nothing said Rodin with an effort I am no milksop
thank heavenI had little sleep last night it is fatiguenothing
more I was saying that I alone could now direct this affair but I
cannot execute the plan myself I must keep out of the way and watch
in the shade I must hold the threads which I alone can manage added
Rodin in a faint voice

My good father said the cardinal uneasily I assure you that you are
very unwell Your paleness is becoming livid

It is possible answered Rodin courageously but I am not to be so
soon conquered To return to our affairthis is the time in which your
qualities Father dAigrigny will turn to good account I have never
denied them and they may now be of the greatest use You have the power
of charminggraceeloquenceyou must

Rodin paused again A cold sweat poured from his forehead He felt his
legs give way under him notwithstanding his obstinate energy

I confess I am not well he said yet this morning I was as well
as ever I shiver I am icy cold

Draw near the fireit is a sudden indisposition said the bishop
offering his arm with heroic devotion it will not be anything of
consequence

If you were to take something warm a cup of tea said the princess
Dr Baleinier will be here directlyhe will reassure us as to
thisindisposition

It is really inexplicable said the prelate

At these words of the cardinal Rodin who had advanced with difficulty
towards the fire turned his eyes upon the prelate and looked at him
fixedly in a strange manner for about a second then strong in his
unconquerable energy notwithstanding the change in his features which
were now visibly disfigured Rodin said in a broken voice which he
tried to make firm The fire has warmed me it will be nothing I have
no time to coddle myself It would be a pretty thing to fall ill just as
the Rennepont affair can only succeed by my exertions Let us return to
business I told you Father dAigrigny that you might serve us a good
deal and you also princess who have espoused this cause as if it were
your own

Rodin again paused This time he uttered a piercing cry sank upon
a chair placed near him and throwing himself back convulsively he
pressed his hands to his chest and exclaimed Oh what pain

Then dreadful sight a cadaverous decomposition rapid as thought
took place in Rodins features His hollow eyes were filled with blood
and seemed to shrink back in their orbits which formed as it were
two dark holes in the centre of which blazed points of fire nervous
convulsions drew the flabby damp and icy skin tight over the bony
prominences of the face which was becoming rapidly green From the
lips writhing with pain issued the struggling breath mingled with the
words Oh I suffer I burn

Then yielding to a transport of fury Rodin tore with his nails his
naked chest for he had twisted off the buttons of his waistcoat and
rent his black and filthy shirtfront as if the pressure of those
garments augmented the violence of the pain under which he was writhing
The bishop the cardinal and Father dAigrigny hastily approached
Rodin to try and hold him he was seized with horrible convulsions
but suddenly collecting all his strength he rose upon his feet stiff
as a corpse Then with his garments in disorder his thin gray hair
standing up all around his greenish face fixing his red and flaming
eyes upon the cardinal he seized him with convulsive grasp and
exclaimed in a terrible voice half stifled in his throat Cardinal
Malipierithis illness is too suddenthey suspect me at Romeyou
are of the race of the Borgiasand your secretary was with me this
morning

Unhappy man what does he dare insinuate cried the prelate as amazed
as he was indignant at the accusation So saying the cardinal strove to
free himself from the grasp of Rodin whose fingers were now as stiff as
iron

I am poisoned muttered Rodin and sinking back he fell into the arms
of Father dAigrigny

Notwithstanding his alarm the cardinal had time to whisper to the
latter He thinks himself poisoned He must therefore be plotting
something very dangerous

The door of the room opened It was Dr Baleinier

Oh doctor cried the princess as she ran pale and frightened towards
him Father Rodin has been suddenly attacked with terrible convulsions
Quick quick

Convulsions oh it will be nothing madame said the doctor throwing
down his hat upon a chair and hastily approaching the group which
surrounded the sick man

Here is the doctor cried the princess All stepped aside except
Father dAigrigny who continued to support Rodin leaning against a
chair

Heavens what symptoms cried Dr Baleinier examining with growing
terror the countenance of Rodin which from green was turning blue

What is it asked all the spectators with one voice

What is it repeated the doctor drawing back as if he had trodden
upon a serpent It is the cholera and contagious

On this frightful magic word Father dAigrigny abandoned his hold of
Rodin who rolled upon the floor

He is lost cried Dr Baleinier But I will run to fetch the means
for a last effort And he rushed towards the door

The Princess de SaintDizier Father dAigrigny the bishop and the
cardinal followed in terror the flight of Dr Baleinier They all
pressed to the door which in their consternation they could not
open It opened at last but from withoutand Gabriel appeared upon
the threshold Gabriel the type of the true priest the holy the
evangelical minister to whom we can never pay enough of respect and
ardent sympathy and tender admiration His angelic countenance in its
mild serenity offered a striking contrast of these faces all disturbed
and contracted with terror

The young priest was nearly thrown down by the fugitives who rushed
through the now open doorway exclaiming Do not go in he is dying of
the cholera Fly

On these words pushing back the bishop who being the last was
trying to force a passage Gabriel ran towards Rodin while the prelate
succeeded in making his escape Rodin stretched upon the carpet his
limbs twisted with fearful cramps was writhing in the extremity
of pain The violence of his fall had no doubt roused him to
consciousness for he moaned in a sepulchral voice They leave me to
dielike a dogthe cowardsHelpno one

And the dying man rolling on his back with a convulsive movement
turned towards the ceiling a face on which was branded the infernal
despair of the damned as he once more repeated No onenot one

His eyes which suddenly flamed with fury just then met the large blue
eyes of the angelic and mild countenance of Gabriel who kneeling beside
him said to him in his soft grave tones I am here fatherto help
you if help be possibleto pray for you if God calls you to him

Gabriel murmured Rodin with failing voice forgive me for the evil
I have done youdo not leave medo not

Rodin could not finish he had succeeded in raising himself into a
sitting posture he now uttered a loud cry and fell back without sense
or motion

The same day it was announced in the evening papers The cholera has
broken out in Paris The first case declared itself this day at half
past three PM in the Rue de Babylone at SaintDizier House




CHAPTER XVIII THE SQUARE OF NOTRE DAME

A week had passed since Rodin was seized with the cholera and its
ravages had continually increased That was an awful time A funeral
pall was spread over Paris once so gay And yet never had the sky been
of a more settled purer blue never had the sun shone more brilliantly
The inexorable serenity of nature during the ravages of the deadly
scourge offered a strange and mysterious contrast The flaunting light
of the dazzling sunshine fell full upon the features contracted by a
thousand agonizing fears Each trembled for himself or for those dear
to him every countenance was stamped with an expression of feverish
astonishment and dread People walked with rapid steps as if they would
escape from the fate which threatened them besides they were in haste
to return to their homes for often they left life health happiness
and two hours later they found agony death and despair

At every moment new dismal objects met the view Sometimes carts passed
along filled with coffins symmetrically piled they stopped before
every house Men in black and gray garments were in waiting before the
door they held out their hands and to some one coffin was thrown to
some two frequently three or four from the same house It sometimes
happened that the store was quickly exhausted and the cart which had
arrived full went away empty whilst many of the dead in the street
were still unserved In nearly every dwelling upstairs and down from
the roof to the cellar there was a stunning tapping of hammers coffins
were being nailed down and so many so very many were nailed that
sometimes those who worked stopped from sheer fatigue Then broke forth
laments heartrending moans despairing imprecations They were uttered
by those from whom the men in black and gray had taken some one to fill
the coffins

Unceasingly were the coffins filled and day and night did those men
work but by day more than by night for as soon as it was dusk came
a gloomy file of vehicles of all kindsthe usual hearses were not
sufficient but cars carts drays hackneycoaches and such like
swelled the funeral procession different to the other conveyances
which entered the streets full and went away emptythese came empty but
soon returned full During that period the windows of many houses were
illuminated and often the lights remained burning till the morning It
was the season These illuminations resembled the gleaming rays which
shine in the gay haunts of pleasure but there were tapers instead
of wax candles and the chanting of prayers for the dead replaced
the murmur of the ballroom In the streets instead of the facetious
transparencies which indicate the costumers there swung at intervals
huge lanterns of a bloodred color with these words in black letters
Assistance for those attacked with the cholera The true places for
revelry during the night were the churchyards they ran riotthey
usually so desolate and silent during the dark quiet hours when the
cypress trees rustle in the breeze so lonely that no human step dared
to disturb the solemn silence which reigned there at night became on
a sudden animated noisy riotous and resplendent with light By
the smoky flames of torches which threw a red glare upon the dark
firtrees and the white tombstones many gravediggers worked merrily
humming snatches of some favorite tune Their laborious and hazardous
industry then commanded a very high price they were in such request
that it was necessary to humor them They drank often and much they
sang long and loud and this to keep up their strength and spirits good
absolute requisites in such an employment If by chance any did not
finish the grave they had begun some obliging comrade finished it for
them fitting expression and placed them in it with friendly care

Other distant sounds responded to the joyous strains of the grave
diggers publichouses had sprung up in the neighborhood of the
churchyards and the drivers of the dead when they had set down their
customers as they jocosely expressed themselves enriched with their
unusual gratuities feasted and made merry like lords dawn often found
them with a glass in their hands and a jest on their lips and strange
to say among these funeral satellites who breathed the very atmosphere
of the disease the mortality was scarcely perceptible In the
dark squalid quarters of the town where surrounded by infectious
exhalations the indigent population was crowded together and miserable
beings exhausted by severe privation were bespoke by the cholera as
it was energetically said at the time not only individuals but whole
families were carried off in a few hours and yet sometimes oh
merciful Providence one or two little children were left in the cold
and empty room after the father and mother brother and sister had
been taken away in their shells

Frequently houses which had swarmed with hard working laborers were
obliged to be shut up for want of tenants in one day they had been
completely cleared by this terrible visitation from the cellars where
little chimneysweepers slept upon straw to the garret on whose cold
brick floor lay stretched some wan and halfnaked being without work
and without bread But of all the wards of Paris that which perhaps
presented the most frightful spectacle during the progress of the
cholera was the City and in the City the square before the cathedral
of NotreDame was almost every day the theatre of dreadful scenes for
this locality was frequently thronged with those who conveyed the sick
from the neighboring streets to the Great Hospital The cholera had
not one aspect but a thousand So that one week after Rodin had
been suddenly attacked several events combining the horrible and the
grotesque occurred in the square of Notre Dame

Instead of the Rue dArcole which now leads directly to the square it
was then approached on one side by a mean narrow lane like all the
other streets of the City and terminating in a dark low archway Upon
entering the square the principal door of the huge Cathedral was to the
left of the spectator and facing him were the Hospital buildings
A little beyond was an opening which gave to view a portion of the
parapet of the Quay NotreDame A placard had been recently stuck on
the discolored and sunken wail of the archway it contained these words
traced in large characters37

VENGEANCE VENGEANCE

The Workingmen carried to the hospitals are poisoned because the
number of patients is too great every night Boats filled with corpses
drop down the Seine

Vengeance and Death to the murderers of the People

Two men enveloped in cloaks and halfhidden in the deep shadow of the
vault were listening with anxious curiosity to the threatening murmur
which rose with increasing force from among a tumultuous assembly
grouped around the Hospital Soon cries of Death to the
doctorsVengeance reached the ears of the persons who were in ambush
under the arch

The posters are working said one the train is on fire When once
the populace is roused we can set them on whom we please

I say replied the other man look over there That Hercules whose
athletic form towers above the mob was cue of the most frantic leaders
when M Hardys factory was destroyed

To be sure he was I know him again Wherever mischief is to be done
you are sure to find those vagabonds

Now take my advice do not let us remain under this archway said
the other man the wind is as cold as ice and though I am cased in
flannel

You are right the cholera is confoundedly impolite Besides
everything is going on well here I am likewise assured that the whole
of the Faubourg SaintAntoine is ready to rise in the republican cause
that will serve our ends and our holy religion will triumph over
revolutionary impiety Let us rejoin Father dAigrigny

Where shall we find him

Near here comecome

The two hastily disappeared

The sun beginning to decline shed its golden rays upon the blackened
sculptures of the porch of NotreDame and upon its two massy towers
rising in imposing majesty against a perfectly blue sky for during
the fast few days a northeast wind dry and cold had driven away
the lightest cloud A considerable number of people as we have already
stated obstructed the approach to the Hospital they crowded round the
iron railings that protect the front of the building behind which was
stationed a detachment of infantry the cries of Death to the doctors
becoming every moment more threatening The people who thus vociferated
belonged to an idle vagabond and depraved populacethe dregs of the
Paris mob and terrible spectacle the unfortunate beings who were
forcibly carried through the midst of these hideous groups entered the
Hospital whilst the air resounded with hoarse clamors and cries of
Death Every moment fresh victims were brought along in litters
and on stretchers the litters were frequently furnished with coarse
curtains and thus the sick occupants were concealed from the public
gaze but the stretchers having no covering the convulsive movements
of the dying patients often thrust aside the sheet and exposed to
view their faces livid as corpses Far from inspiring with terror the
wretches assembled round the Hospital such spectacles became to them
the signal for savage jests and atrocious predictions upon the fate of
these poor creatures when once in the power of the doctors

The big blaster and Ciboule with a good many of their adherents were
among the mob After the destruction of Hardys factory the quarryman
was formally expelled from the union of the Wolves who would have
nothing more to do with this wretch since then he had plunged into
the grossest debauchery and speculating on his herculean strength had
hired himself as the officious champion of Ciboule and her compeers
With the exception therefore of some chance passengers the square of
NotreDame was filled with a ragged crowd composed of the refuse of
the Parisian populacewretches who call for pity as well as blame
for misery ignorance and destitution beget but too fatally vice and
crime These savages of civilization felt neither pity improvement nor
terror at the shocking sights with which they were surrounded careless
of a life which was a daily struggle against hunger or the allurements
of guilt they braved the pestilence with infernal audacity or sank
under it with blasphemy on their lips

The tall form of the quarryman was conspicuous amongst the rest with
inflamed eyes and swollen features he yelled at the top of his voice
Death to the bodysnatchers they poison the people

That is easier than to feed them added Ciboule Then addressing
herself to an old man who was being carried with great difficulty
through the dense crowd upon a chair by two men the hag continued
Hey dont go in there old croaker die here in the open air instead
of dying in that den where youll be doctored like an old rat

Yes added the quarryman and then theyll throw you into the water
to feast the fishes which you wont swallow any more

At these atrocious cries the old man looked wildly around and uttered
faint groans Ciboule wished to stop the persons who were carrying him
and they had much difficulty in getting rid of the hag The number
of cholerapatients arriving increased every moment and soon neither
litters nor stretchers could be obtained so that they were borne along
in the arms of the attendants Several awful episodes bore witness
to the startling rapidity of the infection Two men were carrying a
stretcher covered with a bloodstained sheet one of them suddenly felt
himself attacked with the complaint he stopped short his powerless
arms let go the stretcher he turned pale staggered fell upon the
patient becoming as livid as him the other man struck with terror
fled precipitately leaving his companion and the dying man in the
midst of the crowd Some drew back in horror others burst into a savage
laugh

The horses have taken fright said the quarryman and have left the
turnout in the lurch

Help cried the dying man with a despairing accent for pitys sake
take me in

Theres no more room in the pit said one in a jeering tone

And youve no legs left to reach the gallery added another

The sick man made an effort to rise but his strength failed him he
fell back exhausted on the mattress A sudden movement took place among
the crowd the stretcher was overturned the old man and his companion
were trodden underfoot and their groans were drowned in the cries of
Death to the bodysnatchers The yells were renewed with fresh fury
but the ferocious band who respected nothing in their savage fury
were soon after obliged to open their ranks to several workmen who
vigorously cleared the way for two of their friends carrying in their
arms a poor artisan He was still young but his heavy and already
livid head hung down upon the shoulder of one of them A little child
followed sobbing and holding by one of the workmens coats The
measured and sonorous sound of several drums was now heard at a distance
in the winding streets of the city they were beating the call to
arms for sedition was rife in the Faubourg SaintAntoine The drummers
emerged from under the archway and were traversing the square when one
of them a grayhaired veteran suddenly slackened the rolling of his
drum and stood still his companions turned round in surprisehe had
turned green his legs gave way he stammered some unintelligible words
and had fallen upon the pavement before those in the front rank had time
to pause The overwhelming rapidity of this attack startled for a moment
the most hardened among the surrounding spectators for wondering at
the interruption a part of the crowd had rushed towards the soldiers

At sight of the dying man supported in the arms of two of his comrades
one of the individuals who concealed under the arch had watched the
beginning of the popular excitement said to the drummers Your comrade
drank perhaps at some fountain on the road

Yes sir replied one he was very thirsty he drank two mouthfuls of
water on the Place du Chatelet

Then he is poisoned said the man

Poisoned cried several voices

It is not surprising replied the man in a mysterious tone poison
is thrown into the public fountains and this very morning a man was
massacred in the Rue Beaubourg who was discovered emptying a paper of
arsenic into a pot of wine at a publichouse38

Having said these words the man disappeared in the crowd This report
no less absurd than the tales about the poisoning of the Hospital
patients was received with a general burst of indignation Five or
six ragged beings regular ruffians seized the body of the expiring
drummer hoisted it upon their shoulders in spite of all the efforts
of his comrades to prevent them and paraded the square exhibiting the
dismal trophy Ciboule and the quarryman went before crying Wake way
for the corpse This is how they poison the people

A fresh incident now attracted the attention of the crowd A travelling
carriage which had not been able to pass along the QuaiNapoleon the
pavement of which was up had ventured among the intricate streets of
the city and now arrived in the square of NotreDame on its way to the
other side of the Seine Like many others its owners were flying from
Paris to escape the pestilence which decimated it A manservant and a
ladys maid were in the rumble and they exchanged a glance of alarm as
they passed the Hospital whilst a young man seated in the front part
of the carriage let down the glass and called to the postilions to go
slowly for fear of accident as the crowd was very dense at that part
of the square This young man was Lord Morinval and on the back seat
were Lord Montbron and his niece Lady Morinval The pale and anxious
countenance of the young lady showed the alarm which she felt and
Montbron notwithstanding his firmness of mind appeared to be
very uneasy he as well as his niece frequently had recourse to a
smellingbottle filled with camphor

During the last few minutes the carriage had advanced very slowly
the postilions managing their horses with great caution when a sudden
hubbub at first distant and undefined but soon more distinct arose
among the throng as it drew near the ringing sound of chains and
metal peculiar to the artillerywagons was plainly audible and
presently one of these vehicles came towards the travellingcarriage
from the direction of the Quai NotreDame It seemed strange that
though the crowd was so compact yet at the rapid approach of this
wagon the close ranks of human beings opened as if by enchantment but
the following words which were passed from mouth to mouth soon accounted
for the prodigy A wagon full of dead the wagon of the dead As
we have already stated the usual funeral conveyances were no longer
sufficient for the removal of the corpses a number of artillery wagons
had been put into requisition and the coffins were hastily piled in
these novel hearses

Many of the spectators regarded this gloomy vehicle with dismay but the
quarryman and his band redoubled their horrible jokes

Make way for the omnibus of the departed cried Ciboule

No danger of having ones toes crushed in that omnibus said the
quarryman

Doubtless theyre easy to please the stiffuns in there

They never want to be set down at all events

I say theres only one reglar on duty as postilion

Thats true the leaders are driven by a man in a smockfrock

Oh I daresay the other soldier was tired lazy fellow and got into
the omnibus with the otherstheyll all get out at the same big hole

Head foremost you know

Yes they pitch them head first into a bed of lime

Why one might follow the deadcart blindfold and no mistake Its
worse than Montfaucon knackeryards

Ha ha haits rather gamey said the quarryman alluding to the
infectious and cadaverous odor which this funeral conveyance left behind
it

Heres sport exclaimed Ciboule the omnibus of the dead will run
against the fine coach Hurrah the rich folks will smell death

Indeed the wagon was now directly in front of the carriage and at a
very little distance from it A man in a smockfrock and wooden shoes
drove the two leaders and an artilleryman the other horses The coffins
were so piled up within this wagon that its semicircular top did
not shut down closely so that as it jolted heavily over the uneven
pavement the biers could be seen chafing against each other The fiery
eyes and inflamed countenance of the man in the smockfrock showed that
he was half intoxicated urging on the horses with his voice his heels
and his whip he paid no attention to the remonstrances of the soldier
who had great difficulty in restraining his own animals and was obliged
to follow the irregular movements of the carman Advancing in this
disorderly manner the wagon deviated from its course just as it should
have passed the travellingcarriage and ran against it The shock
forced open the top one of the coffins was thrown out and after
damaging the panels of the carriage fell upon the pavement with a dull
and heavy sound The deal planks had been hastily nailed together and
were shivered in the fall and from the wreck of the coffin rolled a
livid corpse half enveloped in a shroud

At this horrible spectacle Lady Morinval who had mechanically leaned
forward gave a loud scream and fainted The crowd fell back in dismay
the postilions no less alarmed took advantage of the space left open
to them by the retreat of the multitude they whipped their horses and
the carriage dashed on towards the quay As it disappeared behind
the furthermost buildings of the Hospital the shrill joyous notes
of distant trumpets were heard and repeated shouts proclaimed The
Cholera Masquerade The words announced one of those episodes combining
buffoonery with terror which marked the period when the pestilence was
on the increase though now they can with difficulty be credited If
the evidence of eyewitnesses did not agree in every particular with the
accounts given in the public papers of this masquerade they might be
regarded as the ravings of some diseased brain and not as the notice of
a fact which really occurred

The Masquerade of the Cholera appeared we say in the square of Notre
Dame just as Morinvals carriage gained the quay after disengaging
itself from the deathwagon

37 It is wellknown that at the time of the cholera such placards
were numerous in Paris and were alternately attributed to opposite
parties Among others to the priests many of the bishops having
published mandatory letters or stated openly in the churches of their
diocese that the Almighty had sent the cholera as a punishment to
France for having driven away its lawful sovereign and assimilated the
Catholic to other forms of worship

38 It is notorious that at this unhappy period several persons were
massacred under a false accusation of poisoning the fountains etc




CHAPTER XIX THE CHOLERA MASQUERADE39

A stream of people who preceded the masquerade made a sudden irruption
through the arch into the square uttering loud cheers as they advanced
Children were also there blowing horns whilst some hooted and others
hissed

The quarryman Ciboule and their band attracted by this new spectacle
rushed tumultuously towards the arch Instead of the two eatinghouses
which now 1845 stand on either side of the Rue dArcole there was
then only one situated to the left of the vaulted passage and much
celebrated amongst the joyous community of students for the excellence
both of its cookery and its wines At the first blare of the trumpets
sounded by the outriders in livery who preceded the masquerade the
windows of the great room of the eatinghouse were thrown open and
several waiters with their napkins under their arms leaned forward
impatient to witness the arrival of the singular guests they were
expecting

At length the grotesque procession made its appearance in the thick of
an immense uproar The train comprised a chariot escorted by men and
women on horseback clad in rich and elegant fancy dresses Most of
these maskers belonged to the middle and easy classes of society The
report had spread that masquerade was in preparation for the purpose
of daring the cholera and by this joyous demonstration to revive
the courage of the affrighted populace Immediately artists young men
about town students and so on responded to the appeal and though
till now unknown one to the other they easily fraternized together
Many brought their mistresses to complete the show A subscription had
been opened to defray the expenses and that morning after a splendid
breakfast at the other end of Paris the joyous troop had started
bravely on their march to finish the day by a dinner in the square of
Notre Dame

We say bravely for it required a singular turn of mind a rare firmness
of character in young women to traverse in this fashion a great
city plunged in consternation and terrorto fall in at every step with
litters loaded with the dying and carriages filled with the deadto
defy as it were in a spirit of strange pleasantry the plague that was
detonating the Parisians It is certain that in Paris alone and
there only amongst a peculiar class could such an idea have ever been
conceived or realized Two men grotesquely disguised as postilions at
a funeral with formidable false noses rosecolored crape hatbands and
large favors of roses and crape bows at their buttonholes rode before
the vehicle Upon the platform of the car were groups of allegorical
personages representing WINE PLEASURE LOVE PLAY The mission of
these symbolical beings was by means of jokes sarcasms and mockeries
to plague the life out of Goodman Cholera a sort of funeral and
burlesque Cassander whom they ridiculed and made game of in a hundred
ways The moral of the play was this To brave Cholera in security let
us drink laugh game and make love

WINE was represented by a huge lusty Silenus thickset and with
swollen paunch a crown of ivy on his brow a panthers skin across his
shoulder and in his hand a large gilt goblet wreathed with flowers
None other than Ninny Moulin the famous moral and religious writer
could have exhibited to the astonished and delighted spectators an
ear of so deep a scarlet so majestic an abdomen and a face of such
triumphant and majestic fulness Every moment Ninny Moulin appeared to
empty his cupafter which he burst out laughing in the face of Goodman
Cholera Goodman Cholera a cadaverous pantaloon was halfenveloped in
a shroud his mask of greenish cardboard with red hollow eyes seemed
every moment to grin as in mockery of death from beneath his powdered
peruke surmounted by a pyramidical cotton nightcap appeared his neck
and arm dyed of a bright green color his lean hand which shook almost
always with a feverish trembling not feigned but natural rested upon
a crutchhandled cane finally as was becoming in a pantaloon he wore
red stockings with buckles at the knees and high slippers of black
beaver This grotesque representative of the cholera was Sleepinbuff

Notwithstanding a slow and dangerous fever caused by the excessive use
of brandy and by constant debauchery that was silently undermining his
constitution Jacques Rennepont had been induced by Morok to join the
masquerade The brutetamer himself dressed as the King of Diamonds
represented PLAY His forehead was adorned with a diadem of gilded
paper his face was pale and impassible and as his long yellow beard
fell down the front of his particolored robe Morok looked exactly
the character he personated From time to time with an air of grave
mockery he shook close to the eyes of Goodman Cholera a large bag full
of sounding counters and on this bag were painted all sorts of playing
cards A certain stiffness in the right arm showed that the liontamer
had not yet quite recovered from the effects of the wound which the
panther had inflicted before being stabbed by Djalma

PLEASURE who also represented Laughter classically shook her rattle
with its sonorous gilded bells close to the ears of Goodman Cholera
She was a quick lively young girl and her fine black hair was crowned
with a scarlet cap of liberty For Sleepinbuffs sake she had taken the
place of the poor Bacchanal queen who would not have failed to attend
on such an occasionshe who had been so valiant and gay when she
bore her part in a less philosophical but not less amusing masquerade
Another pretty creature Modeste Bornichoux who served as a model to
a painter of renown one of the cavaliers of the procession was
eminently successful in her representation of LOVE He could not have
had a more charming face and more graceful form Clad in a light blue
spangled tunic with a blue and silver band across her chestnut hair
and little transparent wings affixed to her white shoulders she
placed one forefinger upon the other and pointed with the prettiest
impertinence at Goodman Cholera Around the principal group other
maskers more or less grotesque in appearance waved each a banner an
which were inscriptions of a very anacreontic character considering the
circumstances

Down with the Cholera Short and sweet Laugh away laugh always
Well collar the Cholera Love forever Wine forever Come if you
dare old terror

There was really such audacious gayety in this masquerade that the
greater number of the spectators at the moment when it crossed the
square in the direction of the eatinghouse where dinner was waiting
applauded it loudly and repeatedly This sort of admiration which
courage however mad and blind almost always inspires appeared to
others a small number it must be confessed a kind of defiance to the
wrath of heaven and these received the procession with angry murmurs
This extraordinary spectacle and the different impressions it
produced were too remote from all customary facts to admit of a just
appreciation We hardly know if this daring bravado was deserving of
praise or blame

Besides the appearance of those plagues which from age to age decimate
the population of whole countries has almost always been accompanied by
a sort of mental excitement which none of those who have been spared
by the contagion can hope to escape It is a strange fever of the mind
which sometimes rouses the most stupid prejudices and the most ferocious
passions and sometimes inspires on the contrary the most magnificent
devotion the most courageous actionswith some driving the fear
of death to a point of the wildest terrorwith others exciting the
contempt of life to express itself in the most audacious bravadoes
Caring little for the praise or blame it might deserve the masquerade
arrived before the eatinghouse and made its entry in the midst of
universal acclamations Everything seemed to combine to give full effect
to this strange scene by the opposition of the most singular contrasts
Thus the tavern in which was to be held this extraordinary feast being
situated at no great distance from the antique cathedral and the gloomy
hospital the religious anthems of the ancient temple the cries of the
dying and the bacchanalian songs of the banqueteers must needs mingle
and by turns drown one another The maskers now got down from their
chariot and from their horses and went to take their places at the
repast which was waiting for them The actors in the masquerade are
at table in the great room of the tavern They are joyous noisy even
riotous Yet their gayety has a strange tone peculiar to itself

Sometimes the most resolute involuntarily remember that their life is
at stake in this mad and audacious game with destiny That fatal thought
is rapid as the icy fevershudder which chills you in an instant
therefore from time to time an abrupt silence lasting indeed only for
a second betrays these passing emotions which are almost immediately
effaced by new bursts of joyful acclamation for each one says to
himself No weakness my chum and my girl are looking at me

And all laugh and knock glasses together and challenge the next man
and drink out of the glass of the nearest woman Jacques had taken off
the mask and peruke of Goodman Cholera His thin leaden features his
deadly paleness the lurid brilliancy of his hollow eyes showed
the incessant progress of the slow malady which was consuming this
unfortunate man brought by excesses to the last extremity of weakness
Though he felt the slow fire devouring his entrails he concealed his
pain beneath a forced and nervous smile

To the left of Jacques was Morok whose fatal influence was ever on the
increase and to his right the girl disguised as PLEASURE She was named
Mariette By her side sat Ninny Moulin in all his majestic bulk who
often pretended to be looking for his napkin under the table in order
to have the opportunity of pressing the knees of his other neighbor
Modeste the representative of LOVE Most of the guests were grouped
according to their several tastes each tender pair together and the
bachelors where they could They had reached the second course and the
excellence of the wine the good cheer the gay speeches and even the
singularity of the occasion had raised their spirits to a high degree
of excitement as may be gathered from the extraordinary incidents of
the following scene

39 We read in the Constitutionnel Saturday March 31st 1832 The
Parisians readily conform to that part of the official instructions
with regard to the cholera which prescribes as a preservation from the
disease not to be afraid to amuse ones self etc The pleasures of
MidLent have been as brilliant and as mad as those of the carnival
itself For a long time past there had not been so many balls at this
period of the year Even the cholera has been made the subject of an
itinerant caricature




CHAPTER XX THE DEFIANCE

Two or three times without being remarked by the guests one of the
waiters had come to whisper to his fellows and point with expressive
gesture to the ceiling But his comrades had taken small account of his
observations or fears not wishing doubtless to disturb the guests
whose mad gayety seemed ever on the increase

Who can doubt now of the superiority of our manner of treating this
impertinent Cholera Has he dared even to touch our sacred battalion
said a magnificent mountebankTurk one of the standardbearers of the
masquerade

Here is all the mystery answered another It is very simple Only
laugh in the face of the plague and it will run away from you

And right enough too for very stupid work it does added a pretty
little Columbine emptying her glass

You are right my darling it is intolerably stupid work answered
the Clown belonging to the Columbine here you are very quiet enjoying
life and all on a sudden you die with an atrocious grimace Well what
then Clever isnt it I ask you what does it prove

It proves replied an illustrious painter of the romantic school
disguised like a Roman out of one of Davids pictures it proves that
the Cholera is a wretched colorist for he has nothing but a dirty
green on his pallet Evidently he is a pupil of Jacobus that king of
classical painters who are another species of plagues

And yet master added respectfully a pupil of the great painter I
have seen some cholera patients whose convulsions were rather fine and
their dying looks firstrate

Gentlemen cried a sculptor of no less celebrity the question
lies in a nutshell The Cholera is a detestable colorist but a good
draughtsman He shows you the skeleton in no time By heaven how he
strips off the fleshMichael Angelo would be nothing to him

True cried they all with one voice the Cholera is a bad colorist
but a good draughtsman

Moreover gentlemen added Ninny Moulin with comic gravity this
plague brings with it a providential lesson as the great Bossuet would
have said

The lesson the lesson

Yes gentlemen I seem to hear a voice from above proclaiming Drink
of the best empty your purse and kiss your neighbors wife for your
hours are perhaps numbered unhappy wretch

So saying the orthodox Silenus took advantage of a momentary absence
of mind on the part of Modeste his neighbor to imprint on the blooming
cheek of LOVE a long loud kiss The example was contagious and a storm
of kisses was mingled with bursts of laughter

Ha blood and thunder cried the great painter as he gayly threatened
Ninny Moulin you are very lucky that tomorrow will perhaps be the end
of the world or else I should pick a quarrel with you for having kissed
my lovely LOVE

Which proves to you O Rubens O Raphael the thousand advantages of
the Cholera whom I declare to be essentially sociable and caressing

And philanthropic said one of the guests thanks to him creditors
take care of the health of their debtors This morning a usurer who
feels a particular interest in my existence brought me all sorts of
anticholeraic drugs and begged me to make use of them

And I said the pupil of the great painter My tailor wished to force
me to wear a flannel band next to the skin because I owe him a thousand
crowns But I answered Oh tailor give me a receipt in full and I
will wrap myself up in flannel to preserve you my custom

O Cholera I drink to thee said Ninny Moulin by way of grotesque
invocation You are not Despair on the contrary you are the emblem
of Hopeyes of hope How many husbands how many wives longed for
a number alas too uncertain chance in the lottery of widowhood You
appear and their hearts are gladdened Thanks to you benevolent pest
their chances of liberty are increased a hundredfold

And how grateful heirs ought to be A colda heata trifleand
there in an hour some old uncle becomes a revered benefactor

And those who are always looking out for other peoples placeswhat an
ally they must find in the Cholera

And how true it will make many vows of constancy said Modeste
sentimentally How many villains have sworn to a poor weak woman to
love her all their lives who never meant the wretches to keep their
word so well

Gentlemen cried Ninny Moulin since we are now perhaps at the eve
of the end of the world as yonder celebrated painter has expressed
it I propose to play the world topsyturvy I beg these ladies to make
advances to us to tease us to excite us to steal kisses from us to
take all sorts of liberties with us and we shall not die of it even
to insult us Yes I declare that I will allow myself to be insulted
So LOVE you may offer me the greatest insult that can be offered to a
virtuous and modest bachelor added the religious writer leaning over
towards his neighbor who repulsed him with peals of laughter and the
proposal of Ninny Moulin being received with general hilarity a new
impulse was given to the mirth and riot

In the midst of the uproar the waiter who had before entered the room
several times to whisper uneasily to his comrades whilst he pointed
to the ceiling again appeared with a pale and agitated countenance
approaching the man who performed the office of butler he said to him
in a low voice tremulous with emotion They are come

Who

You knowup there and he pointed to the ceiling

Oh said the butler becoming thoughtful where are they

They have just gone upstairs they are there now answered the waiter
shaking his head with an air of alarm yes they are there

What does master say

He is very vexed because and the waiter glanced round at the
guests He does not know what to do he has sent me to you

What the devil have I to do with it said the other wiping his
forehead It was to be expected and cannot be helped

I will not remain here till they begin

You may as well go for your long face already attracts attention Tell
master we must wait for the upshot

The above incident was scarcely perceived in the midst of the growing
tumult of the joyous feast But among the guests one alone laughed
not drank not This was Jacques With fixed and lurid eye he gazed
upon vacancy A stranger to what was passing around him the unhappy man
thought of the Bacchanal Queen who had been so gay and brilliant in the
midst of similar saturnalia The remembrance of that one being whom
he still loved with an extravagant love was the only thought that from
time to time roused him from his besotted state

It is strange but Jacques had only consented to join this masquerade
because the mad scene reminded him of the merry day he had spent with
Cephysethat famous breakfast after a night of dancing in which the
Bacchanal Queen from some extraordinary presentiment had proposed a
lugubrious toast with regard to this very pestilence which was then
reported to be approaching France To the Cholera had she said Let
him spare those who wish to live and kill at the same moment those who
dread to part

And now at this time remembering those mournful words Jacques was
absorbed in painful thought Morok perceived his absence of mind and
said aloud to him You have given over drinking Jacques Have you had
enough wine Then you will want brandy I will send for some

I want neither wine nor brandy answered Jacques abruptly and he
fell back into a sombre reverie

Well you may be right resumed Morok in a sardonic tone and raising
his voice still higher You do well to take care of yourself I was
wrong to name brandy in these times There would be as much temerity in
facing a bottle of brandy as the barrel of a loaded pistol

On hearing his courage as a toper called in question Sleepinbuff looked
angrily at Morok You think it is from cowardice that I will not drink
brandy cried the unfortunate man whose halfextinguished intellect
was roused to defend what he called his dignity Is it from cowardice
that I refuse dye think Morok Answer me

Come my good fellow we have all shown our pluck today said one of
the guests to Jacques you above all who being rather indisposed
yet had the courage to take the part of Goodman Cholera

Gentlemen resumed Morok seeing the general attention fixed upon
himself and Sleepinbuff I was only joking for if my comrade pointing
to Jacques had the imprudence to accept my offer it would be an act
not of courage but of foolhardiness Luckily he has sense enough to
renounce a piece of boasting so dangerous at this time and I

Waiter cried Jacques interrupting Morok with angry impatience two
bottles of brandy and two glasses

What are you going to do said Morok with pretended uneasiness Why
do you order two bottles of brandy

For a duel said Jacques in a cool resolute tone

A duel cried the spectators in surprise

Yes resumed Jacques a duel with brandy You pretend there is as
much danger in facing a bottle of brandy as a loaded pistol let us each
take a full bottle and see who will be the first to cry quarter

This strange proposition was received by some with shouts of joy and by
others with genuine uneasiness

Bravo the champions of the bottle cried the first

No no there would be too much danger in such a contest said the
others

Just now added one of the guests this challenge is as serious as an
invitation to fight to the death

You hear said Morok with a diabolical smile you hear Jacques
Will you now retreat before the danger

At these words which reminded him of the peril to which he was about
to expose himself Jacques started as if a sudden idea had occurred to
him He raised his head proudly his cheeks were slightly flushed his
eye shone with a kind of gloomy satisfaction and he exclaimed in a firm
voice Hang it waiter are you deaf I asked you for two bottles of
brandy

Yes sir said the waiter going to fetch them although himself
frightened at what might be the result of this bacchanalian struggle
But the mad and perilous resolution of Jacques was applauded by the
majority

Ninny Moulin moved about on his chair stamped his feet and shouted
with all his might Bacchus and drink bottles and glasses the throats
are dry brandy to the rescue Largess largess

And like a true champion of the tournament he embraced Modeste
adding to excuse the liberty Love you shall be the Queen of Beauty
and I am only anticipating the victors happiness

Brandy to the rescue repeated they all in chorus Largess

Gentlemen added Ninny Moulin with enthusiasm shall we remain
indifferent to the noble example set us by Goodman Cholera He said in
his pride brandy Let us gloriously answer punch

Yes yes punch

Punch to the rescue

Waiter shouted the religious writer with the voice of a Stentor
waiter have you a pan a caldron a hogshead or any other immensity
in which we can brew a monster punch

A Babylonian punch

A lake of punch

An ocean of punch

Such was the ambitious crescendo that followed the proposition of Ninny
Moulin

Sir answered the waiter with an air of triumph we just happen to
have a large copper caldron quite new It has been used and would hold
at least thirty bottles

Bring the caldron said Ninny Moulin majestically

The caldron forever shouted the chorus

Put in twenty bottles of brandy six loaves of sugar a dozen lemons a
pound of cinnamon and thenfire fire shouted the religious writer
with the most vociferous exclamations

Yes yes fire repeated the chorus

The proposition of Ninny Moulin gave a new impetus to the general
gayety the most extravagant remarks were mingled with the sound of
kisses taken or given under the pretext that perhaps there would be
no tomorrow that one must make the most of the present etc etc
Suddenly in one of the moments of silence which sometimes occur in the
midst of the greatest tumult a succession of slow and measured taps
sounded above the ceiling of the banquetingroom All remained silent
and listened




CHAPTER XXI BRANDY TO THE RESCUE

After the lapse of some seconds the singular rapping which had so much
surprised the guests was again heard but this time louder and longer

Waiter cried one of the party what in the devils name is
knocking

The waiter exchanging with his comrades a look of uneasiness and alarm
stammered Out in reply Sirit isit is

Well I suppose it is some crabbed crossgrained lodger some animal
the enemy of joy who is pounding on the floor of his room to warn us to
sing less loud said Ninny Moulin

Then by a general rule answered sententiously the pupil of the great
painter if lodger or landlord ask for silence tradition bids us reply
by an infernal uproar destined to drown all his remonstrances Such at
least added the scapegrace modestly are the foreign relations that
I have always seen observed between neighboring powers

This remark was received with general laughter and applause During the
tumult Morok questioned one of the waiters and then exclaimed in a
shrill tone which rose above the clamor I demand a hearing

Granted cried the others gayly During the silence which followed
the exclamation of Morok the noise was again heard it was this time
quicker than before

The lodger is innocent said Morok with a strange smile and would
be quite incapable of interfering with your enjoyment

Then why does he keep up that knocking said Ninny Moulin emptying
his glass

Like a deaf man who has lost his earhorn added the young artist

It is not the lodger who is knocking said Morok in a sharp quick
tone for they are nailing him down in his coffin A sudden and
mournful silence followed these words

His coffin no I am wrong resumed Morok her coffin I should say
or more properly their coffin for in these pressing times they put
mother and child together

A woman cried PLEASURE addressing the writer is it a woman that is
dead

Yes maam a poor young woman about twenty years of age answered the
waiter in a sorrowful tone Her little girl that she was nursing died
soon afterall in less than two hours My master is very sorry that
you ladies and gents should be disturbed in this way but he could not
foresee this misfortune as yesterday morning the young woman was quite
well and singing with all her mightno one could have been gayer than
she was

Upon these words it was as if a funeral pall had been suddenly thrown
over a scene lately so full of joy all the rubicund and jovial faces
took an expression of sadness no one had the hardihood to make a
jest of mother and child nailed down together in the same coffin The
silence became so profound that one could hear each breath oppressed by
terror the last blows of the hammer seemed to strike painfully on every
heart it appeared as if each sad feeling until now repressed
was about to replace that animation and gayety which had been more
factitious than sincere The moment was decisive It was necessary to
strike an immediate blow and to raise the spirits of the guests for
many pretty rosy faces began to grow pale many scarlet ears became
suddenly white Ninny Moulins were of the number

On the contrary Sleepinbuff exhibited an increase of audacity he drew
up his figure bent down from the effects of exhaustion and with a
cheek slightly flushed he exclaimed Well waiter are those bottles
of brandy coming And the punch Devil and all are the dead to frighten
the living

Hes right Down with sorrow and lets have the punch cried several
of the guests who felt the necessity of reviving their courage

Forward punch

Begone dull care

Jollity forever

Gentlemen here is the punch said a waiter opening the door At
sight of the flaming beverage which was to reanimate their enfeebled
spirits the room rang with the loudest applause

The sun had just set The room was large being capable of dining a
hundred guests and the windows were few narrow and half veiled by red
cotton curtains Though it was not yet night some portions of this vast
saloon were almost entirely dark Two waiters brought the monsterpunch
in an immense brass kettle brilliant as gold suspended from an iron
bar and crowned with flames of changing color The burning beverage was
then placed upon the table to the great joy of the guests who began to
forget their past alarms

Now said Jacques to Morok in a taunting tone while the punch is
burning we will have our duel The company shall judge Then pointing
to the two bottles of brandy which the waiter had brought Jacques
added Choose your weapon

Do you choose answered Morok

Well heres your bottleand heres your glass Ninny Moulin shall be
umpire

I do not refuse to be judge of the field answered the religious
writer only I must warn you comrade that you are playing a desperate
game and that just now as one of these gentlemen has said the neck
of a bottle of brandy in ones mouth is perhaps more dangerous than the
barrel of a loaded pistol

Give the word old fellow said Jacques interrupting Ninny Moulin
or I will give it myself

Since you will have it soso be it

The first who gives in is conquered said Jacques

Agreed answered Morok

Come gentlemen attention we must follow every movement resumed
Ninny Moulin Let us first see if the bottles are of the same
sizeequality of weapons being the foremost condition

During these preparations profound silence reigned in the room The
courage of the majority of those present animated for a moment by the
arrival of the punch was soon again depressed by gloomy thoughts
as they vaguely foresaw the danger of the contest between Morok and
Jacques This impression joined to the sad thoughts occasioned by the
incident of the coffin darkened by degrees many a countenance Some
of the guests indeed continued to make a show of rejoicing but their
gayety appeared forced Under certain circumstances the smallest things
will have the most powerful effect We have said that after sunset
a portion of this large room was plunged in obscurity therefore the
guests who sat in the remote corners of the apartment had no other
light than the reflection of the flaming punch Now it is well known
that the flame of burning spirit throws a livid bluish tint over the
countenance it was therefore a strange almost frightful spectacle to
see a number of the guests who happened to be at a distance from the
windows in this ghastly and fantastic light

The painter more struck than all the rest by this effect of color
exclaimed Look at this end of the table we might fancy ourselves
feasting with cholerapatients we are such fine blues and greens

This jest was not much relished Fortunately the loud voice of Ninny
Moulin demanded attention and for a moment turned the thoughts of the
company

The lists are open cried the religious writer really more frightened
than he chose to appear Are you ready brave champions he added

We are ready said Morok and Jacques

Present fire cried Ninny Moulin clapping his hands And the two
drinkers each emptied a tumbler full of brandy at a draught

Morok did not even knit his brow his marble face remained impassible
with a steady hand he replaced his glass upon the table But Jacques as
he put down his glass could not conceal a slight convulsive trembling
caused by internal suffering

Bravely done cried Ninny Moulin The quarter of a bottle of brandy
at a draughtit is glorious No one else here would be capable of such
prowess And now worthy champions if you believe me you will stop
where you are

Give the word answered Jacques intrepidly And with feverish and
shaking hand he seized the bottle then suddenly instead of filling
his glass he said to Morok Bah we want no glasses It is braver to
drink from the bottle I dare you to it

Moroks only answer was to shrug his shoulders and raise the neck
of the bottle to his lips Jacques hastened to imitate him The thin
yellowish transparent glass gave a perfect view of the progressive
diminution of the liquor The stony countenance of Morok and the pale
thin face of Jacques on which already stood large drops of cold sweat
were now as well as the features of the other guests illuminated
by the bluish light of the punch every eye was fixed upon Morok and
Jacques with that barbarous curiosity which cruel spectacles seem
involuntarily to inspire

Jacques continued to drink holding the bottle in his left hand
suddenly he closed and tightened the fingers of his right hand with
a convulsive movement his hair clung to his icy forehead and his
countenance revealed an agony of pain Yet he continued to drink only
without removing his lips from the neck of the bottle he lowered it for
an instant as if to recover breath Just then Jacques met the sardonic
look of Morok who continued to drink with his accustomed impassibility
Thinking that he saw the expression of insulting triumph in Moroks
glance Jacques raised his elbow abruptly and drank with avidity a few
drops more But his strength was exhausted A quenchless fire devoured
his vitals His sufferings were too intense and he could no longer bear
up against them His head fell backwards his jaws closed convulsively
he crushed the neck of the bottle between his teeth his neck grew
rigid his limbs writhed with spasmodic action and he became almost
senseless

Jacques my good fellow it is nothing cried Morok whose ferocious
glance now sparkled with diabolical joy Then replacing his bottle
on the table he rose to go to the aid of Ninny Moulin who was vainly
endeavoring to hold Sleepinbuff

This sudden attack had none of the symptoms of cholera Yet terror
seized upon all present one of the women was taken with hysterics and
another uttered piercing cries and fainted away Ninny Moulin leaving
Jacques in the hands of Morok ran towards the door to seek for
helpwhen that door was suddenly opened and the religious writer drew
back in alarm at the sight of the unexpected personage who appeared on
the threshold




CHAPTER XXII MEMORIES

The person before whom Ninny Moulin stopped in such extreme astonishment
was the Bacchanal Queen

Pale and wan with hair in disorder hollow cheeks sunken eyes and
clothed almost in rags this brilliant and joyous heroine of so many mad
orgies was now only the shadow of her former self Misery and grief were
impressed on that countenance once so charming Hardly had she entered
the room when Cephyse paused her mournful and unquiet gaze strove
to penetrate the halfobscurity of the apartment in search of him she
longed to see Suddenly the girl started and uttered a loud scream
She had just perceived at the other side of a long table by the bluish
light of the punch Jacques struggling with Morok and one of the guests
who were hardly able to restrain his convulsive movements

At this sight Cephyse in her first alarm carried away by her
affection did what she had so often done in the intoxication of joy and
pleasure Light and agile instead of losing precious time in making a
long circuit she sprang at once upon the table passed nimbly through
the array of plates and bottles and with one spring was by the side of
the sufferer

Jacques she exclaimed without yet remarking the liontamer and
throwing herself on the neck of her lover Jacques it is ICephyse

That wellknown voice that heartpiercing cry which came from the
bottom of the soul seemed not unheard by Sleepinbuff He turned his
head mechanically towards the Bacchanal Queen without opening his eyes
and heaved a deep sigh his stiffened limbs relaxed a slight trembling
succeeded to the convulsions and in a few seconds his heavy eyelids
were raised with an effort so as to uncover his dull and wandering
gaze Mute with astonishment the spectators of this scene felt an
uneasy curiosity Cephyse kneeling beside her lover bathed his hands
in her tears covered them with kisses and exclaimed in a voice broken
by sobs It is ICephyseI have found you againit was not my fault
that I abandoned you Forgive me forgive

Wretched woman cried Morok irritated at this meeting which might
perhaps be fatal to his projects do you wish to kill him In his
present state this agitation is death Begone So saying he seized
Cephyse suddenly by the arm just as Jacques waking as it were from a
painful dream began to distinguish what was passing around him

You It is you cried the Bacchanal Queen in amazement as she
recognized Morok who separated me from Jacques

She paused for the dim eye of the victim as it rested upon her grew
suddenly bright

Cephyse murmured Jacques is it you

Yes it is I answered she in a voice of deep emotion who have
comeI will tell you

She was unable to continue and as she clasped her hands together
her pale agitated tearful countenance expressed her astonishment and
despair at the mortal change which had taken place in the features
of Jacques He understood the cause of her surprise and as he
contemplated in his turn the suffering and emaciated countenance of
Cephyse he said to her Poor girl you also have had to bear much
grief much miseryI should hardly have known you

Yes replied Cephyse much griefmuch miseryand worse than
misery she added trembling whilst a deep blush overspread her pale
features

Worse than misery said Jacques astonished

But it is you who have suffered hastily resumed Cephyse without
answering her lover

Just now I was going to make an end of ityour voice has recalled me
for an instantbut I feel something here and he laid his hand upon
his breast which never gives quarter It is all the same nowI have
seen youI shall die happy

You shall not die Jacques I am here

Listen to one my girl If I had a bushel of live coal in my stomach
it could hardly burn me more For more than a month I have been
consuming my body by a slow fire This gentleman he added glancing at
Morok this dear friend always undertook to feed the flame I do not
regret life I have lost the habit of work and taken to drink and riot
I should have finished by becoming a thorough blackguard I preferred
that my friend here should amuse himself with lighting a furnace in my
inside Since what I drank just now I am certain that it fumes like
yonder punch

You are both foolish and ungrateful said Morok shrugging his
shoulders you held out your glass and I filled itand faith we
shall drink long and often together yet

For some moments Cephyse had not withdrawn her eyes from Morok I tell
you that you have long blown the fire in which I have burnt my skin
resumed Jacques addressing Morok in a feeble voice so that they may
not think I die of cholera It would look as if I had been frightened
by the part I played I do not therefore reproach you my affectionate
friend added he with a sardonic smile you dug my grave gaylyand
sometimes when seeing the great dark hole into which I was about to
fall I drew back a stepbut you my excellent friend still pushed
me forward saying Go on my boy go onand I went onand here I
am

So saying Sleepinbuff burst into a bitter laugh which sent an icy
shudder through the spectators of this scene

My good fellow said Morok coolly listen to me and follow my
advice

Thank you I know your adviceand instead of listening to you I
prefer speaking to my poor Cephyse Before I go down to the moles I
should like to tell her what weighs on my heart

Jacques replied Cephyse do not talk so I tell you you shall not
die

Why then my brave Cephyse I shall owe my life to you returned
Jacques in a tone of serious feeling which surprised the spectators
Yes resumed he when I came to myself and saw you so poorly clad
I felt something good about my heartdo you know whyit was because
I said to myself Poor girl she has kept her word bravely she has
chosen to toil and want and sufferrather than take another lovewho
would have given her what I gave her as long as I couldand that
thought Cephyse refreshed my soul I needed it for I was burningand
I burn still added he clinching his fists with pain but that made
me happyit did me goodthanks my good brave Cephyseyes you are
good and braveand you were right for I never loved any but you in the
wide world and if in my degradation I had one thought that raised me
a little above the filth and made me regret that I was not betterthe
thought was of you Thanks then my poor dear love said Jacques
whose hot and shining eyes were becoming moist thanks once again and
he reached his cold hand to Cephyse if I die I shall die happyif I
live I shall live happy also Give me your hand my brave Cephyseyou
have acted like a good and honest creature

Instead of taking the hand which Jacques offered her Cephyse still
kneeling bowed her head and dared not raise her eyes to her lover

You dont answer said he leaning over towards the young girl you
dont take my handwhy is this

The unfortunate creature only answered by stifled sobs Borne down with
shame she held herself in so humble so supplicating an attitude that
her forehead almost touched the feet of her lover

Amazed at the silence and conduct of the Bacchanal Queen Jacques
looked at her with increasing agitation suddenly he stammered out with
trembling lips Cephyse I know you If you do not take my hand it is
because

Then his voice failing he added in a dull tone after a moments
silence When six weeks ago I was taken to prison did you not say to
me Jacques I swear that I will workand if need be live in horrible
miserybut I will live true That was your promise Now I know you
never speak false tell me you have kept your word and I shall believe
you

Cephyse only answered by a heartrending sob as she pressed the knees
of Jacques against her heaving bosom By a strange contradiction more
common than is generally thoughtthis man degraded by intoxication
and debauchery who since he came out of prison had plunged in every
excess and tamely yielded to all the fatal incitements of Morok yet
received a fearful blow when he learned by the mute avowal of
Cephyse the infidelity of this creature whom he had loved in spite of
degradation The first impulse of Jacques was terrible Notwithstanding
his weakness and exhaustion he succeeded in rising from his seat and
with a countenance contracted by rage and despair he seized a knife
before they had time to prevent him and turned it upon Cephyse But at
the moment he was about to strike shrinking from an act of murder he
hurled the knife far away from him and falling back into the chair
covered his face with his hands

At the cry of Ninny Moulin who had though late thrown himself upon
Jacques to take away the knife Cephyse raised her head Jacquess
woeful dejection wrung her heart she rose and fell upon his neck
notwithstanding his resistance exclaiming in a voice broken by sobs
Jacques if you knew if you only knewlistendo not condemn me
without hearing meI will tell you all I swear to youwithout
falsehoodthis man and she pointed to Morok will not dare deny what
I say he came and told me to have the courage to

I do not reproach you I have no right to reproach you Let me die
in peace I ask nothing but that now said Jacques in a still weaker
voice as he repulsed Cephyse Then he added with a grievous and
bitter smile Luckily I have my dose I knewwhat I was doingwhen I
accepted the duel with brandy

No you shall not die and you shall hear me cried Cephyse with a
bewildered air you shall hear me and everybody else shall hear me
They shall see that it is not my fault Is it not so gentlemen Do I
not deserve pity You will entreat Jacques to forgive me for if driven
by miseryfinding no workI was forced to thisnot for the sake of
any luxuryyou see the rags I wearbut to get bread and shelter for my
poor sick sisterdying and even more miserable than myselfwould you
not have pity upon me Do you think one finds pleasure in ones infamy
cried the unfortunate with a burst of frightful laughter then she
added in a low voice and with a shudder Oh if you knew Jacques it
is so infamous so horrible that I preferred death to falling so low
a second time I should have killed myself had I not heard you were
here Then seeing that Jacques did not answer her but shook his
head mournfully as he sank down though still supported by Ninny
Moulin Cephyse exclaimed as she lifted her clasped hands towards him
Jacques one wordfor pitys sakeforgive me

Gentlemen pray remove this woman cried Morok the sight of her
causes my friend too painful emotions

Come my dear child be reasonable said several of the guests who
deeply moved by this scene were endeavoring to withdraw Cephyse from
it leave him and come with us he is not in any danger

Gentlemen oh gentlemen cried the unfortunate creature bursting
into tears and raising her hands in supplication listen to meI
will do all that you wish meI will gobut in heavens name send
for help and do not let him die thus Look what pain he suffers what
horrible convulsions

She is right said one of the guests hastening towards the door we
must send for a doctor

There is no doctor to be found said another they are all too busy

We will do better than that cried a third the Hospital is just
opposite and we can carry the poor fellow thither They will give him
instant help A leaf of the table will make a litter and the table
cloth a covering

Yes yes that is it said several voices let us carry him over at
once

Jacques burnt up with brandy and overcome by his interview with
Cephyse had again fallen into violent convulsions It was the dying
paroxysm of the unfortunate man They were obliged to tie him with the
ends of the cloth so as to secure him to the leaf which was to serve
for a litter which two of the guests hastened to carry away They
yielded to the supplication of Cephyse who asked as a last favor to
accompany Jacques to the Hospital When the mournful procession quitted
the great room of the eatinghouse there was a general flight among the
guests Men and women made haste to wrap themselves in their cloaks in
order to conceal their costumes The coaches which had been ordered in
tolerable number for the return of the masquerade had luckily
arrived The defiance had been fully carried out the audacious bravado
accomplished and they could now retire with the honors of war Whilst a
part of the guests were still in the room an uproar at first distant
but which soon drew nearer broke out with incredible fury in the square
of Notre Dame

Jacques had been carried to the outer door of the tavern Morok and
Ninny Moulin striving to open a passage through the crowd in the
direction of the Hospital preceded the litter A violent reflux of
the multitude soon forced them to stop whilst a new storm of savage
outcries burst from the other extremity of the square near the angle of
the church

What is it then asked Ninny Moulin of one of those ignoble figures
that was leaping up before him What are those cries

They are making mincemeat of a poisoner like him they have thrown
into the river replied the man If you want to see the fun follow me
close added he and peg away with your elbows for fear you should be
too late

Hardly had the wretch pronounced these words than a dreadful shriek
sounded above the roar of the crowd through which the bearers of the
litter preceded by Morok were with difficulty making their way It
was Cephyse who uttered that cry Jacques one of the seven heirs of the
Rennepont family had just expired in her arms By a strange fatality
at the very moment that the despairing exclamation of Cephyse announced
that death another cry rose from that part of the square where they
were attacking the poisoner That distant supplicating cry tremulous
with horrible alarm like the last appeal of a man staggering beneath
the blows of his murderers chilled the soul of Morok in the midst of
his execrable triumph

Damnation cried the skillful assassin who had selected drunkenness
and debauchery for his murderous but legal weapons it is the voice of
the Abbe dAigrigny whom they have in their clutches




CHAPTER XXIII THE POISONER

It is necessary to go back a little before relating the adventure of
Father dAigrigny whose cry of distress made so deep an impression upon
Morok just at the moment of Jacques Renneponts death We have said that
the most absurd and alarming reports were circulating in Paris not only
did people talk of poison given to the sick or thrown into the public
fountains but it was also said that wretches had been surprised in the
act of putting arsenic into the pots which are usually kept all ready
on the counters of wineshops Goliath was on his way to rejoin Morok
after delivering a message to Father dAigrigny who was waiting in a
house on the Place de lArcheveche He entered a wineshop in the Rue
de la Calandre to get some refreshment and having drunk two glasses
of wine he proceeded to pay for them Whilst the woman of the house was
looking for change Goliath mechanically and very innocently rested
his hand on the mouth of one of the pots that happened to be within his
reach

The tall stature of this man and his repulsive and savage countenance
had already alarmed the good woman whose fears and prejudices had
previously been roused by the public rumors on the subject of poisoning
but when she saw Goliath place his hand over the mouth of one of her
pots she cried out in dismay Oh my gracious what are you throwing
into that pot At these words spoken in a loud voice and with the
accent of terror two or three of the drinkers at one of the tables
rose precipitately and ran to the counter while one of them rashly
exclaimed It is a poisoner

Goliath not aware of the reports circulated in the neighborhood did
not at first understand of what he was accused The men raised their
voices as they called on him to answer the charge but he trusting to
his strength shrugged his shoulders in disdain and roughly demanded
the change which the pale and frightened hostess no longer thought of
giving him

Rascal cried one of the men with so much violence that several of
the passersby stopped to listen you shall have your change when you
tell us what you threw in the pot

Ha did he throw anything into the winepot said one of the passers
by

It is perhaps a poisoner said another

He ought to be taken up added a third

Yes yes cried those in the househonest people perhaps but under
the influence of the general panic he must be taken up for he has
been throwing poison into the winepots

The words He is a poisoner soon spread through the group which at
first composed of three or four persons increased every instant around
the door of the wineshop A dull menacing clamor began to rise from
the crowd the first accuser seeing his fears thus shared and almost
justified thought he was acting like a good and courageous citizen
in taking Goliath by the collar and saying to him Come and explain
yourself at the guardhouse villain

The giant already provoked at insults of which he did not perceive the
real meaning was exasperated at this sudden attack yielding to his
natural brutality he knocked his adversary down upon the counter
and began to hammer him with his fists During this collision several
bottles and two or three panes of glass were broken with much noise
whilst the woman of the house more and more frightened cried out with
all her might Help a poisoner Help murder

At the sound of the breaking windows and these cries of distress the
passersby of whom the greater number believed in the stories about
the poisoners rushed into the shop to aid in securing Goliath But
the latter thanks to his herculean strength after struggling for
some moments with seven or eight persons knocked down two of his most
furious assailants disengaged himself from the others drew near the
counter and taking a vigorous spring rushed headforemost like
a bull about to butt upon the crowd that blocked up the door then
forcing a passage by the help of his enormous shoulders and athletic
arms he made his way into the street and ran with all speed in the
direction of the square of NotreDame his garments torn his head bare
and his countenance pale and full of rage Immediately a number of
persons from amongst the crowd started in pursuit of Goliath and a
hundred voices exclaimed Stopstop the poisoner

Hearing these cries and seeing a man draw near with a wild and troubled
look a butcher who happened to be passing with his large empty tray
on his head threw it against Goliaths shins and taken by surprise he
stumbled and fell The butcher thinking he had performed as heroic an
action as if he had encountered a mad dog flung himself on Goliath
and rolled over with him on the pavement exclaiming Help it is a
poisoner Help help This scene took place not far from the Cathedral
but at some distance from the crowd which was pressing round the
hospital gate as well as from the eatinghouse in which the masquerade
of the cholera then was The day was now drawing to a close On the
piercing call of the butcher several groups at the head of which were
Ciboule and the quarryman flew towards the scene of the struggle
while those who had pursued the pretended poisoner from the Rue de la
Calandre reached the square on their side

At sight of this threatening crowd advancing towards him Goliath
whilst he continued to defend himself against the butcher who held him
with the tenacity of a bulldog felt that he was lost unless he could
rid himself of this adversary before the arrival of the rest with a
furious blow of the fist therefore he broke the jaw of the butcher
who just then was above him and disengaging himself from his hold he
rose and staggered a few steps forward Suddenly he stopped He saw
that he was surrounded Behind him rose the walls of the cathedral to
the right and left and in front of him advanced a hostile multitude
The groans uttered by the butcher who had just been lifted from the
ground covered with blood augmented the fury of the populace

This was a terrible moment for Goliath still standing alone in the
centre of a ring that grew smaller every second he saw on all sides
angry enemies rushing towards him and uttering cries of death As the
wild boar turns round once or twice before resolving to stand at bay
and face the devouring pack Goliath struck with terror made one or
two abrupt and wavering movements Then as he abandoned the possibility
of flight instinct told him that he had no mercy to expect from a crowd
given up to blind and savage furya fury the more pitiless as it was
believed to be legitimate Goliath determined therefore at least to
sell his life dearly he sought for a knife in his pocket but not
finding it he threw out his left leg in an athletic posture and
holding up his muscular arms hard and stiff as bars of iron waited
with intrepidity for the shock

The first who approached Goliath was Ciboule The hag heated and out
of breath instead of rushing upon him paused stooped down and
taking off one of the large wooden shoes that she wore hurled it at the
giants head with so much force and with so true an aim that it struck
him right in the eye which hung half out of its socket Goliath pressed
his hands to his face and uttered a cry of excruciating pain

Ive made him squint said Ciboule with a burst of laughter

Goliath maddened by the pain instead of waiting for the attack which
the mob still hesitated to begin so greatly were they awed by his
appearance of herculean strengththe only adversary worthy to cope with
him being the quarryman who had been borne to a distance by the surging
of the crowdGoliath in his rage rushed headlong upon the nearest
Such a struggle was too unequal to last long but despair redoubled
the Colossuss strength and the combat was for a moment terrible The
unfortunate man did not fall at once For some seconds almost buried
amid a swarm of furious assailants one saw now his mighty arm rise and
fall like a sledge hammer beating upon skulls and faces and now his
enormous head livid and bloody drawn back by some of the combatants
hanging to his tangled hair Here and there sudden openings and violent
oscillations of the crowd bore witness to the incredible energy of
Goliaths defence But when the quarryman succeeded in reaching him
Goliath was overpowered and thrown down A long savage cheer in triumph
announced this fall for under such circumstances to go under is to
die Instantly a thousand breathless and angry voices repeated the cry
of Death to the poisoner

Then began one of those scenes of massacre and torture worthy of
cannibals horrible to relate and the more incredible that they happen
almost always in the presence and often with the aid of honest and
humane people who blinded by false notions and stupid prejudices
allow themselves to be led into all sorts of barbarity under the idea
of performing an act of inexorable justice As it frequently happens
the sight of the blood which flowed in torrents from Goliaths wounds
inflamed to madness the rage of his assailants A hundred fists struck
at the unhappy man he was stamped under foot his face and chest were
beaten in Ever and anon in the midst of furious cries of Death to the
poisoner heavy blows were audible followed by stifled groans It was
a frightful butchery Each individual yielding to a sanguinary frenzy
came in turn to strike his blow or to tear off his morsel of flesh
Womenyes womenmotherscame to spend their rage on this mutilated
form

There was one moment of frightful terror With his face all bruised and
covered with mud his garments in rags his chest bare red gaping with
woundsGoliath availing himself of a moments weariness on the part of
his assassins who believed him already finished succeeded by one of
those convulsive starts frequent in the last agony in raising himself
to his feet for a few seconds then blind with wounds and loss of
blood striking about his arms in the air as if to parry blows that were
no longer struck he muttered these words which came from his mouth
accompanied by a crimson torrent Mercy I am no poisoner Mercy This
sort of resurrection produced so great an effect on the crowd that for
an instant they fell hack affrighted The clamor ceased and a small
space was left around the victim Some hearts began even to feel pity
when the quarryman seeing Goliath blinded with blood groping before
him with his hands exclaimed in ferocious allusion to a wellknown
game Now for blindmansbluff

Then with a violent kick he again threw down the victim whose head
struck twice heavily on the pavement

Just as the giant fell a voice from amongst the crowd exclaimed It is
Goliath stop he is innocent

It was Father dAigrigny who yielding to a generous impulse was
making violent efforts to reach the foremost rank of the actors in this
scene and who cried out as he came nearer pale indignant menacing
You are cowards and murderers This man is innocent I know him You
shall answer for his life

These vehement words were received with loud murmurs

You know that poisoner cried the quarryman seizing the Jesuit by the
collar then perhaps you are a poisoner too

Wretch exclaimed Father dAigrigny endeavoring to shake himself
loose from the grasp do you dare to lay hand upon me

Yes I dare do anything answered the quarryman

He knows him hes a poisoner like the other cried the crowd
pressing round the two adversaries whilst Goliath who had fractured
his skull in the fall uttered a long deathrattle

At a sudden movement of Father dAigrigny who disengaged himself from
the quarryman a large glass phial of peculiar form very thick and
filled with a greenish liquor fell from his pocket and rolled close
to the dying Goliath At sight of this phial many voices exclaimed
together It is poison Only see He had poison upon him

The clamor redoubled at this accusation and they pressed so close to
Abbe dAigrigny that he exclaimed Do not touch me do not approach
me

If he is a poisoner said a voice no more mercy for him than for the
other

I a poisoner said the abbe struck with horror

Ciboule had darted upon the phial the quarryman seized it from her
uncorked it and presenting it to Father dAigrigny said to him Now
tell us what is that

It is not poison cried Father dAigrigny

Then drink it returned the quarryman

Yes yes let him drink it cried the mob

Never answered Father dAigrigny in extreme alarm And he drew back
as he spoke pushing away the phial with his hand

Do you see It is poison He dares not drink it they exclaimed
Hemmed in on every side Father dAigrigny stumbled against the body of
Goliath

My friends cried the Jesuit who without being a poisoner found
himself exposed to a terrible alternative for his phial contained
aromatic salts of extraordinary strength designed for a preservative
against the cholera and as dangerous to swallow as any poison my good
friends you are in error I conjure you in the name of heaven

If that is not poison drink it interrupted the quarryman as he
again offered the bottle to the Jesuit

If he does not drink it death to the poisoner of the poor

Yesdeath to him death to him

Unhappy men cried Father dAigrigny whilst his hair stood on end
with terror do you mean to murder me

What about all those that you and your mate have killed you wretch

But it is not trueand

Drink then repeated the inflexible quarryman I ask you for the
last time

To drink that would be death cried Father dAigrigny

Oh only hear the wretch cried the mob pressing closer to him he
has confessedhe has confessed

He has betrayed himself40

He said to drink that would be death

But listen to me cried the abbe clasping his hands together this
phial is

Furious cries interrupted Father dAigrigny Ciboule make an end of
that one cried the quarryman spurning Goliath with his foot I will
begin this one And he seized Father dAigrigny by the throat

At these words two different groups formed themselves One led by
Ciboule made an end of Goliath with kicks and blows stones and
wooden shoes his body was soon reduced to a horrible thing mutilated
nameless formlessa mere inert mass of filth and mangled flesh
Ciboule gave her cloak which they tied to one of the dislocated ankles
of the body and thus dragged it to the parapet of the quay There with
shouts of ferocious joy they precipitated the bloody remains into
the river Now who does not shudder at the thought that in a time of
popular commotion a word a single word spoken imprudently even by
an honest man and without hatred will suffice to provoke so horrible a
murder

Perhaps it is a poisoner said one of the drinkers in the tavern of
the Rue de la Calandrenothing moreand Goliath had been pitilessly
murdered

What imperious reasons for penetrating the lowest depths of the masses
with instruction and with lightto enable unfortunate creatures
to defend themselves from so many stupid prejudices so many fatal
superstitions so much implacable fanaticismHow can we ask for
calmness reflection selfcontrol or the sentiment of justice from
abandoned beings whom ignorance has brutalized and misery depraved
and suffering made ferocious and of whom society takes no thought
except when it chains them to the galleys or binds them ready for the
executioner The terrible cry which had so startled Morok was uttered
by Father dAigrigny as the quarryman laid his formidable hand upon him
saying to Ciboule Make an end of that oneI will begin this one

40 This fact is historical A man was murdered because a phial full
of ammonia was found upon him On his refusal to drink it the populace
persuaded that the bottle contained poison tore him to pieces




CHAPTER XXIV IN THE CATHEDRAL

Night was almost come as the mutilated body of Goliath was thrown into
the river The oscillations of the mob had carried into the street
which runs along the left side of the cathedral the group into whose
power Father dAigrigny had fallen Having succeeded in freeing himself
from the grasp of the quarryman but still closely pressed by the
multitude that surrounded him crying Death to the poisoner he
retreated step by step trying to parry the blows that were dealt him
By presence of mind address and courage recovering at that critical
moment his old military energy he had hitherto been able to resist and
to remain firm on his feetknowing by the example of Goliath that
to fall was to die Though he had little hope of being heard to any
purpose the abbe continued to call for help with all his might
Disputing the ground inch by inch he manoeuvred so as to draw near
one of the lateral walls of the church and at length succeeded in
ensconcing himself in a corner formed by the projection of a buttress
and close by a little door

This position was rather favorable Leaning with his back against the
wall Father dAigrigny was sheltered from the attacks of a portion of
his assailants But the quarryman wishing to deprive him of this last
chance of safety rushed upon him with the intention of dragging him
out into the circle where he would have been trampled under foot The
fear of death gave Father dAigrigny extraordinary strength and he was
able once more to repulse the quarryman and remain entrenched in the
corner where he had taken refuge The resistance of the victim redoubled
the rage of the assailants Cries of murderous import resounded with
new violence The quarryman again rushed upon Father dAigrigny saying
Follow me friends this lasts too long Let us make an end of it

Father dAigrigny saw that he was lost His strength was exhausted
and he felt himself sinking his legs trembled under him and a cloud
obscured his sight the howling of the furious mob began to sound dull
upon his ear The effects of violent contusions received during the
struggle both on the head and chest were now very perceptible Two or
three times a mixture of blood and foam rose to the lips of the abbe
his position was a desperate one

To be slaughtered by these brutes after escaping death so often in
war Such was the thought of Father dAigrigny as the quarryman rushed
upon him

Suddenly at the very moment when the abbe yielding to the instinct of
selfpreservation uttered one last call for help in a heartpiercing
voice the door against which he leaned opened behind him and a firm
hand caught hold of him and pulled him into the church Thanks to
this movement performed with the rapidity of lightning the quarryman
thrown forward in his attempt to seize Father dAigrigny could not
check his progress and found himself just opposite to the person who
had come as it were to take the place of the victim

The quarryman stopped short and then fell back a couple of paces so
much was he amazed at this sudden apparition and impressed like the
rest of the crowd with a vague feeling of admiration and respect
at sight of him who had come so miraculously to the aid of Father
dAigrigny It was Gabriel The young missionary remained standing on
the threshold of the door His long black cassock was half lost in
the shadows of the cathedral whilst his angelic countenance with its
border of long light hair now pale and agitated by pity and grief was
illumined by the last faint rays of twilight This countenance shone
with so divine a beauty and expressed such touching and tender
compassion that the crowd felt awed as with his large blue eyes full
of tears and his hands clasped together he exclaimed in a sonorous
voice Have mercy my brethren Be humanebe just

Recovering from his first feeling of surprise and involuntary emotion
the quarryman advanced a step towards Gabriel and said to him No
mercy for the poisoner we must have him Give him up to us or we go
and take him

You cannot think of it my brethren answered Gabriel the church is
a sacred placea place of refuge for the persecuted

We would drag our prisoner from the altar answered the quarryman
roughly so give him up to us

Listen to me my brethren said Gabriel extending his arms towards
them

Down with the shaveling cried the quarryman let us go in and hunt
him up in the church

Yes yes cried the mob again led away by the violence of this
wretch down with the black gown

They are all of a piece

Down with them

Let us do as we did at the archbishops

Or at SaintGermainlAuxerrois

What do our likes care for a church

If the priests defend the poisoners well pitch them into the water
too

Yes yes

Ill show you the lead cried the quarryman and followed by Ciboule
and a good number of determined men he rushed towards Gabriel

The missionary who for some moments had watched the increasing fury
of the crowd had foreseen this movement hastily retreating into the
church he succeeded in spite of the efforts of the assailants in
nearly closing the door and in barricading it by the help of a wooden
bar which he held in such a manner as would enable the door to resist
for a few minutes

Whilst he thus defended the entrance Gabriel shouted to Father
dAigrigny Fly father fly through the vestry the other doors are
fastened

The Jesuit overpowered by fatigue covered with contusions bathed in
cold sweat feeling his strength altogether fail and too soon fancying
himself in safety had sunk half fainting into a chair At the
voice of Gabriel he rose with difficulty and with a trembling step
endeavored to reach the choir separated from the rest of the church by
an iron railing

Quick father added Gabriel in alarm using every effort to maintain
the door which was now vigorously assailed Make haste In a few
minutes it will be too late All alone continued the missionary in
despair alone to arrest the progress of these madmen

He was indeed alone At the first outbreak of the attack three or four
sacristans and other members of the establishment were in the church
but struck with terror and remembering the sack of the archbishops
palace and of SaintGermainlAuxerrois they had immediately taken
flight Some of them had concealed themselves in the organloft and
others fled into the vestry the doors of which they locked after them
thus cutting off the retreat of Gabriel and Father dAigrigny The
latter bent double by pain yet roused by the missionarys portentive
warning helping himself on by means of the chairs he met with on his
passage made vain efforts to reach the choir railing After advancing
a few steps vanquished by his suffering he staggered and fell upon the
pavement deprived of sense and motion At the same moment Gabriel
in spite of the incredible energy with which the desire to save Father
dAigrigny had inspired him felt the door giving way beneath the
formidable pressure from without

Turning his head to see if the Jesuit had at least quitted the church
Gabriel to his great alarm perceived that he was lying motionless at
a few steps from the choir To abandon the halfbroken door to run
to Father dAigrigny to lift him in his arms and drag him within
the railing of the choir was for the young priest an action rapid as
thought for he closed the gate of the choir just at the instant that
the quarryman and his band having finished breaking down the door
rushed in a body into the church

Standing in front of the choir with his arms crossed upon his
breast Gabriel waited calmly and intrepidly for this mob still more
exasperated by such unexpected resistance

The door once forced the assailants rushed in with great violence But
hardly had they entered the church than a strange scene took place It
was nearly dark only a few silver lamps shed their pale light round
the sanctuary whose far outlines disappeared in the shadow On suddenly
entering the immense cathedral dark silent and deserted the most
audacious were struck with awe almost with fear in presence of the
imposing grandeur of that stony solitude Outcries and threats died away
on the lips of the most furious They seemed to dread awaking the
echoes of those enormous arches those black vaults from which oozed a
sepulchral dampness which chilled their brows inflamed with anger and
fell upon their shoulders like a mantle of ice

Religious tradition routine habit the memories of childhood have so
much influence upon men that hardly had they entered the church than
several of the quarrymans followers respectfully took off their hats
bowed their bare heads and walked along cautiously as if to check the
noise of their footsteps on the sounding stones Then they exchanged a
few words in a low and fearful whisper Others timidly raised their eyes
to the far heights of the topmost arches of that gigantic building
now lost in obscurity and felt almost frightened to see themselves so
little in the midst of that immensity of darkness But at the first joke
of the quarryman who broke this respectful silence the emotion soon
passed away

Blood and thunder cried he are you fetching breath to sing vespers
If they had wine in the font well and good

These words were received with a burst of savage laughter All this
time the villain will escape said one

And we shall be done added Ciboule

One would think we had cowards here who are afraid of the sacristans
cried the quarryman

Never replied the others in chorus we fear nobody

Forward

Yes yesforward was repeated on all sides And the animation which
had been calmed down for a moment was redoubled in the midst of
renewed tumult Some moments after the eyes of the assailants becoming
accustomed to the twilight were able to distinguish in the midst of
the faint halo shed around by a silver lamp the imposing countenance of
Gabriel as he stood before the iron railing of the choir

The poisoner is here hid in some corner cried the quarryman We
must force this parson to give us back the villain

He shall answer for him

He took him into the church

He shall pay for both if we do not find the other

As the first impression of involuntary respect was effaced from the
minds of the crowd their voices rose the louder and their faces became
the more savage and threatening because they all felt ashamed of their
momentary hesitation and weakness

Yes yes cried many voices trembling with rage we must have the
life of one or the other

Or of both

So much the worse for this priest if he wants to prevent us from
serving out our poisoner

Death to him death to him

With this burst of ferocious yells which were fearfully reechoed from
the groined arches of the cathedral the mob maddened by rage rushed
towards the choir at the door of which Gabriel was standing The young
missionary who when placed on the cross by the savages of the Rocky
Mountains yet entreated heaven to spare his executioners had too much
courage in his heart too much charity in his soul not to risk his life
a thousand times over to save Father dAigrignysthe very man who had
betrayed hire by such cowardly and cruel hypocrisy




CHAPTER XXV THE MURDERERS

The quarryman followed by his gang ran towards Gabriel who had
advanced a few paces from the choirrailing and exclaimed his eyes
sparkling with rage Where is the poisoner We will have him

Who has told you my brethren that he is a poisoner replied
Gabriel with his deep sonorous voice A poisoner Where are the
proofswitnesses or victims

Enough of that stuff we are not here for confession brutally
answered the quarryman advancing towards him in a threatening manner
Give up the man to us he shall be forthcoming unless you choose to
stand in his shoes

Yes yes exclaimed several voices they are in with one another
One or the other we will have

Very well then since it is so said Gabriel raising his head and
advancing with calmness resignation and fearlessness he or me
added heit seems to make no difference to youyou are determined
to have bloodtake mine and I will pardon you my friends for a fatal
delusion has unsettled your reason

These words of Gabriel his courage the nobleness of his attitude
the beauty of his countenance had made an impression on some of
the assailants when suddenly a voice exclaimed Look there is the
poisoner behind the railing

Wherewhere cried they

Theredont you seestretched on the floor

On hearing this the mob which had hitherto formed a compact mass in
the sort of passage separating the two sides of the nave between the
rows of chairs dispersed in every direction to reach the railing
of the choir the last and only barrier that now sheltered Father
dAigrigny During this manoeuvre the quarryman Ciboule and others
advanced towards Gabriel exclaiming with ferocious joy This time we
have him Death to the poisoner

To save Father dAigrigny Gabriel would have allowed himself to be
massacred at the entrance of the choir but a little further on the
railing not above four feet in height would in another instant be
scaled or broken through The Missionary lost all hope of saving the
Jesuit from a frightful death Yet he exclaimed Stop poor deluded
peopleand extending his arms he threw himself in front of the
crowd

His words gesture and countenance were expressive of an authority
at once so affectionate and so fraternal that there was a momentary
hesitation amongst the mob But to this hesitation soon succeeded the
most furious cries of Death death

You cry for his death cried Gabriel growing still paler

Yes yes

Well let him die cried the missionary inspired with a sudden
thought let him die on the instant

These words of the young priest struck the crowd with amazement For a
few moments they all stood mute motionless and as it were paralyzed
looking at Gabriel in stupid astonishment

This man is guilty you say resumed the young missionary in a voice
trembling with emotion You have condemned him without proof without
witnessesno matter he must die You reproach him with being a
poisoner where are his victims You cannot tellbut no matter he is
condemned You refuse to hear his defense the sacred right of every
accused personno matter the sentence is pronounced You are at once
his accusers judges and executioners Be it soYou have never seen
till now this unfortunate man he has done you no harm he has perhaps
not done harm to any oneyet you take upon yourselves the terrible
responsibility of his deathunderstand me wellof his death Be it so
then your conscience will absolve youI will believe it He must die
the sacredness of Gods house will not save him

No no cried many furious voices

No resumed Gabriel with increasing warmth no you have determined
to shed his blood and you will shed it even in the Lords temple It
is you say your right You are doing an act of terrible justice But
why then so many vigorous arms to make an end of one dying man Why
these outcries this fury this violence Is it thus that the people
the strong and equitable people are wont to execute their judgments
No no when sure of their right they strike their enemies it is
with the calmness of the judge who in freedom of soul and conscience
passes sentence No the strong and equitable people do not deal their
blows like men blind or mad uttering cries of rage as if to drown the
sense of some cowardly and horrible murder No it is not thus that they
exercise the formidable right to which you now lay claimfor you will
have it

Yes we will have it shouted the quarryman Ciboule and others of
the more pitiless portion of the mob whilst a great number remained
silent struck with the words of Gabriel who had just painted to them
in such lively colors the frightful act they were about to commit

Yes resumed the quarryman it is our right we have determined to
kill the poisoner

So saying and with bloodshot eyes and flushed cheek the wretch
advanced at the head of a resolute group making a gesture as though he
would have pushed aside Gabriel who was still standing in front of the
railing But instead of resisting the bandit the missionary advanced
a couple of steps to meet him took him by the arm and said in a firm
voice Come

And dragging as it were with him the stupefied quarryman whose
companions did not venture to follow at the moment struck dumb as they
were by this new incident Gabriel rapidly traversed the space which
separated him from the choir opened the iron gate and still holding
the quarryman by the arm led him up to the prostrate form of Father
dAigrigny and said to him There is the victim He is condemned
Strike

I cried the quarryman hesitating Iall alone

Oh replied Gabriel with bitterness there is no danger You can
easily finish him Look he is broken down with suffering he has hardly
a breath of life left he will make no resistance Do not be afraid

The quarryman remained motionless whilst the crowd strangely impressed
with this incident approached a little nearer the railing without
daring to come within the gate

Strike then resumed Gabriel addressing the quarryman whilst he
pointed to the crowd with a solemn gesture there are the judges you
are the executioner

No cried the quarryman drawing back and turning away his eyes Im
not the executionernot I

The crowd remained silent For a few moments not a word not a cry
disturbed the stillness of the solemn cathedral In a desperate case
Gabriel had acted with a profound knowledge of the human heart When the
multitude inflamed with blind rage rushes with ferocious clamor upon
a single victim and each man strikes his blow this dreadful species of
combined murder appears less horrible to each because they all share in
the common crime and then the shouts the sight of blood the desperate
defence of the man they massacre finish by producing a sort of
ferocious intoxication but amongst all those furious madmen who take
part in the homicide select one and place him face to face with the
victim no longer capable of resistance and say to him Strikehe
will hardly ever dare to do so

It was thus with the quarryman the wretch trembled at the idea of
committing a murder in cold blood all alone The preceding scene had
passed very rapidly amongst the companions of the quarryman nearest
to the railing some did not understand an impression which they would
themselves have felt as strongly as this bold man if it had been said
to them Do the office of executioner These therefore began to
murmur aloud at his weakness He dares not finish the poisoner said
one

The coward

He is afraid

He draws back Hearing these words the quarryman ran to the gate
threw it wide open and pointing to Father dAigrigny exclaimed If
there is one here braver than I am let him go and finish the joblet
him be the executionercome

On this proposal the murmurs ceased A deep silence reigned once more in
the cathedral All those countenances but now so furious became sad
confused almost frightened

The deluded mob began to appreciate the ferocious cowardice of the
action it had been about to commit Not one durst go alone to strike the
half expiring man Suddenly Father dAigrigny uttered a dying rattle
his head and one of his arms stirred with a convulsive movement and
then fell back upon the stones as if he had just expired

Gabriel uttered a cry of anguish and threw himself on his knees close
to Father dAigrigny exclaiming Great Heaven he is dead

There is a singular variableness in the mind of a crowd susceptible
alike to good or evil impressions At the heartpiercing cry of Gabriel
all these people who a moment before had demanded with loud uproar
the massacre of this man felt touched with a sudden pity The words
He is dead circulated in low whispers through the crowd accompanied
by a slight shudder whilst Gabriel raised with one hand the victims
heavy head and with the other sought to feel if the pulse still beat
beneath the icecold skin

Mr Curate said the quarryman bending towards Gabriel is there
really no hope

The answer was waited for with anxiety in the midst of deep silence
The people hardly ventured to exchange a few words in whispers

Blessed be God exclaimed Gabriel suddenly His heart beats

His heart beats repeated the quarryman turning his head towards the
crowd to inform them of the good news

Oh his heart beats repeated the others in whispers

There is hope We may yet save him added Gabriel with an expression
of indescribable happiness

We may yet save him repeated the quarryman mechanically

We may yet save him muttered the crowd

Quick quick resumed Gabriel addressing the quarryman help me
brother Let us carry him to a neighboring house where he can have
immediate aid

The quarryman obeyed with readiness Whilst the missionary lifted Father
dAigrigny by holding him under the arms the quarryman took the legs
of the almost inanimate body Together they carried him outside of the
choir At sight of the formidable quarryman aiding the young priest
to render assistance to the man whom he had just before pursued with
menaces of death the multitude felt a sudden thrill of compassion
Yielding to the powerful influence of the words and example of Gabriel
they felt themselves deeply moved and each became anxious to offer
services

Mr Curate he would perhaps be better on a chair that one could carry
upright said Ciboule

Shall I go and fetch a stretcher from the hospital asked another

Mr Curate let me take your place the body is too heavy for you

Dont trouble yourself said a powerful man approaching the
missionary respectfully I can carry him alone

Shall I run and fetch a coach Mr Curate said a young vagabond
taking off his red cap

Right said the quarryman run away my buck

But first ask Mr Curate if you are to go for a coach said Ciboule
stopping the impatient messenger

True added one of the bystanders we are here in a church and Mr
Curate has the command He is at home

Yes yes go at once my child said Gabriel to the obliging young
vagabond

Whilst the latter was making his way through the crowd a voice said
Ive a little wickerbottle of brandy will that be of any use

No doubt answered Gabriel hastily pray give it here We can rub
his temples with the spirit and make him inhale a little

Pass the bottle cried Ciboule but dont put your noses in it
And passed with caution from hand to hand the flask reached Gabriel in
safety

Whilst waiting for the coming of the coach Father dAigrigny had
been seated on a chair Whilst several goodnatured people carefully
supported the abbe the missionary made him inhale a little brandy In a
few minutes the spirit had a powerful influence on the Jesuit he made
some slight movements and his oppressed bosom heaved with a deep sigh

He is savedhe will live cried Gabriel in a triumphant voice he
will live my brothers

Oh glad to hear it exclaimed many voices

Oh yes be glad my brothers repeated Gabriel for instead of
being weighed down with the remorse of crime you will have a just and
charitable action to remember Let us thank God that he has changed
your blind fury into a sentiment of compassion Let us pray to Him that
neither you nor those you love may ever be exposed to such frightful
danger as this unfortunate man has just escaped Oh my brothers added
Gabriel as he pointed to the image of Christ with touching emotion
which communicated itself the more easily to others from the expression
of his angelic countenance oh my brothers let us never forget that
HE who died upon that cross for the defence of the oppressed for
the obscure children of the people like to ourselves pronounced those
affectionate words so sweet to the heart Love ye one anotherLet
us never forget it let us love and help one another and we poor
people shall then become better happier just Loveyes love ye one
anotherand fall prostrate before that Saviour who is the God of all
that are weak oppressed and suffering in this world

So saying Gabriel knelt down All present respectfully followed his
example such power was there in his simple and persuasive words At
this moment a singular incident added to the grandeur of the scene We
have said that a few seconds before the quarryman and his band entered
the body of the church several persons had fled from it Two of these
had taken refuge in the organloft from which retreat they had viewed
the preceding scene themselves remaining invisible One of these
persons was a young man charged with the care of the organ and quite
musician enough to play on it Deeply moved by the unexpected turn of an
event which at first appeared so tragical and yielding to an artistical
inspiration this young man at the moment when he saw the people
kneeling with Gabriel could not forbear striking the notes Then a sort
of harmonious sigh at first almost insensible seemed to rise from the
midst of this immense cathedral like a divine aspiration As soft and
aerial as the balmy vapor of incense it mounted and spread through the
lofty arches Little by little the faint sweet sounds though still as
it were covered changed to an exquisite melody religious melancholy
and affectionate which rose to heaven like a song of ineffable
gratitude and love And the notes were at first so faint so covered
that the kneeling multitude had scarcely felt surprise and had yielded
insensibly to the irresistible influence of that enchanting harmony

Then many an eye until now dry and ferocious became wet with
tearsmany hard hearts beat gently as they remembered the words
pronounced by Gabriel with so tender an accent Love ye one another
It was at this moment that Father dAigrigny came to himselfand opened
his eyes He thought himself under the influence of a dream He had
lost his senses in sight of a furious populace who with insult and
blasphemy on their lips pursued him with cries of death even to the
sanctuary of the temple He opened his eyesand by the pale light of
the sacred lamps to the solemn music of the organ he saw that crowd
just now so menacing and implacable kneeling in mute and reverential
emotion and humbly bowing their heads before the majesty of the shrine

Some minutes after Gabriel carried almost in triumph on the shoulders
of the crowd entered the coach in which Father dAigrigny who by
degrees had completely recovered his senses was already reclining By
the order of the Jesuit the coach stopped before the door of a house
in the Rue de Vaugirard he had the strength and courage to enter this
dwelling alone Gabriel was not admitted but we shall conduct the
reader thither




CHAPTER XXVI THE PATIENT

At the end of the Rue de Vaugirard there was then a very high wall
with only one small doorway in all its length On opening this door
you entered a yard surrounded by a railing with screens like Venetian
blinds to prevent your seeing between the rails Crossing this
courtyard you come to a fine large garden symmetrically planted at
the end of which stood a building two stories high looking perfectly
comfortable without luxury but with all that cozy simplicity which
betokens discreet opulence A few days had elapsed since Father
dAigrigny had been so courageously rescued by Gabriel from the popular
fury Three ecclesiastics wearing black gowns white bands and square
caps were walking in the garden with a slow and measured step The
youngest seemed to be about thirty years of age his countenance was
pale hollow and impressed with a certain ascetic austerity His two
companions aged between fifty or sixty had on the contrary faces at
once hypocritical and cunning their round rosy cheeks shone brightly
in the sunshine whilst their triple chins buried in fat descended in
soft folds over the fine cambric of their bands According to the rules
of their order they belonged to the Society of Jesus which forbade
their walking only two together these three members of the brotherhood
never quitted each other a moment

I fear said one of the two continuing a conversation already begun
and speaking of an absent person I fear that the continual agitation
to which the reverend father has been a prey ever since he was attacked
with the cholera has exhausted his strength and caused the dangerous
relapse which now makes us fear for his life

They say resumed the other that never was there seen anxiety like
to his

And moreover remarked the young priest bitterly it is painful to
think that his reverence Father Rodin has given cause for scandal
by obstinately refusing to make a public confession the day before
yesterday when his situation appeared so desperate that between two
fits of a delirium it was thought right to propose to him to receive
the last sacraments

His reverence declared that he was not so ill as they supposed
answered one of the fathers and that he would have the last duties
performed when he thought necessary

The fact is that for the last ten days ever since he was brought here
dying his life has been as it were only a long and painful agony and
yet he continues to live

I watched by him during the first three days of his malady with M
Rousselet the pupil of Dr Baleinier resumed the youngest father he
had hardly a moments consciousness and when the Lord did grant him
a lucid interval he employed it in detestable execrations against the
fate which had confined him to his bed

It is said resumed the other that Father Rodin made answer to
his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri who came to persuade him to die in an
exemplary manner worthy of a son of Loyola our blessed founderat
these words the three Jesuits bowed their heads together as if they
had been all moved by the same springit is said that Father Rodin
made answer to his eminence I do not need to confess publicly I WANT
TO LIVE AND I WILL LIVE

I did not hear that said the young priest with an indignant air
but if Father Rodin really made use of such expressions it is

Here no doubt reflection came to him just in time for he stole a
sidelong glance at his two silent impassible companions and added It
is a great misfortune for his soul but I am certain his reverence has
been slandered

It was only as a calumnious report that I mentioned those words said
the other priest exchanging a glance with his companion

One of the garden gates opened and one of the three reverend fathers
exclaimed at the sight of the personage who now entered Oh here is
his Eminence Cardinal Malipieri coming to pay a visit to Father Rodin

May this visit of his eminence said the young priest calmly be
more profitable to Father Rodin than the last

Cardinal Malipieri was crossing the garden on his way to the apartment
occupied by Rodin

Cardinal Malipieri whom we saw assisting at the sort of council held at
the Princess de SaintDiziers now on his way to Rodins apartment was
dressed as a layman but enveloped in an ample pelisse of pucecolored
satin which exhaled a strong odor of camphor for the prelate had
taken care to surround himself with all sorts of anticholera specifics
Having reached the second story of the house the cardinal knocked at
a little gray door Nobody answering he opened it and like a man to
whom the locality was well known passed through a sort of antechamber
and entered a room in which was a turnup bed On a black wood table
were many phials which had contained different medicines The prelates
countenance seemed uneasy and morose his complexion was still yellow
and bilious the brown circle which surrounded his black squinting eyes
appeared still darker than usual

Pausing a moment he looked round him almost in fear and several times
stopped to smell at his anticholera bottle Then seeing he was alone
he approached a glass over the chimneypiece and examined with much
attention the color of his tongue after some minutes spent in this
careful investigation with the result of which he appeared tolerably
satisfied he took some preservative lozenges out of a golden box and
allowed them to melt in his mouth whilst he closed his eyes with a
sanctified air Having taken these sanitary precautions and again
pressed his bottle to his nose the prelate prepared to enter the third
room when he heard a tolerably loud noise through the thin partition
which separated him from it and stopping to listen all that was said
in the next apartment easily reached his ear

Now that my wounds are dressed I will get up said weak but sharp
and imperious voice

Do not think of it reverend father was answered in a stronger tone
it is impossible

You shall see if it is impossible replied the other voice

But reverend father you will kill yourself You are not in a state to
get up You will expose yourself to a mortal relapse I cannot consent
to it

To these words succeeded the noise of a faint struggle mingled with
groans more angry than plaintive and the voice resumed No no
father for your own safety I will not leave your clothes within your
reach It is almost time for your medicine I will go and prepare it for
you

Almost immediately after the door opened and the prelate saw enter a
man of about twentyfive years of age carrying on his arm an old olive
greatcoat and threadbare black trousers which he threw down upon a
chair

This personage was Ange Modeste Rousselet chief pupil of Dr Baleinier
the countenance of the young practitioner was mild humble and
reserved his hair very short in front flowed down upon his neck
behind He made a slight start in surprise on perceiving the cardinal
and bowed twice very low without raising his eyes

Before anything else said the prelate with his marked Italian
accent still holding to his nose his bottle of camphor have any
choleraic symptoms returned

No my lord the pernicious fever which succeeded the attack of
cholera still continues

Very good But will not the reverend father be reasonable What was the
noise that I just heard

His reverence wished absolutely to get up and dress himself but his
weakness is so great that he could not have taken two steps from the
bed He is devoured by impatience and we fear that this agitation will
cause a mortal relapse

Has Dr Baleinier been here this morning

He has just left my lord

What does he think of the patient

He finds him in the most alarming state my lord The night was so bad
that he was extremely uneasy this morning Father Rodin is at one of
those critical junctures when a few hours may decide the life or death
of the patient Dr Baleinier is now gone to fetch what is necessary for
a very painful operation which he is about to perform on the reverend
father

Has Father dAigrigny been told of this

Father dAigrigny is himself very unwell as your eminence knows he
has not been able to leave his bed for the last three days

I inquired about him as I came up answered the prelate and I shall
see him directly But to return to Father Rodin have you sent for
his confessor since he is in a desperate state and about to undergo a
serious operation

Dr Baleinier spoke a word to him about it as well as about the last
sacraments but Father Rodin exclaimed with great irritation that they
did not leave him a moments peace that he had as much care as any one
for his salvation and that

Per Bacco I am not thinking of him cried the cardinal interrupting
Ange Modeste Rousselet with his pagan oath and raising his sharp voice
to a still higher key I am not thinking of him but of the interests
of the Company It is indispensable that the reverend father should
receive the sacraments with the most splendid solemnity and that his
end should not only be Christian but exemplary All the people in the
house and even strangers should be invited to the spectacle so that
his edifying death may produce an excellent sensation

That is what Fathers Grison and Brunet have already endeavored to
persuade his reverence my lord but your Eminence knows with what
impatience Father Rodin received this advice and Dr Baleinier did not
venture to persist for fear of advancing a fatal crisis

Well I will venture to do it for in these times of revolutionary
impiety a solemnly Christian death would produce a very salutary
effect on the public It would indeed be proper to make the necessary
preparations to embalm the reverend father he might then lie in state
for some days with lighted tapers according to Romish custom My
secretary would furnish the design for the bier it would be very
splendid and imposing from his position in the Order Father Rodin is
entitled to have everything in the most sumptuous style He must have at
least six hundred tapers and a dozen funeral lamps burning spirits of
wine to hang just over the body and light it from above the effect
would be excellent We must also distribute little tracts to the people
concerning the pious and ascetic life of his reverence

Here a sudden noise like that of some piece of metal thrown angrily on
the floor was heard from the next room in which was the sick man and
interrupted the prelate in his description

I hope Father Rodin has not heard you talk of embalming him my lord
said Rousselet in a whisper his bed touches the partition and almost
everything is audible through it

If Father Rodin has heard me answered the cardinal sinking his
voice and retiring to the other end of the room this circumstance
will enable me to enter at once on the business but in any case
I persist in believing that the embalming and the lying in state are
required to make a good effect upon the public The people are already
frightened at the cholera and such funeral pomp would have no small
influence on the imagination

I would venture to observe to your Eminence that here the laws are
opposed to such exhibitions

The lawsalready the laws said the cardinal angrily has not Rome
also her laws And is not every priest a subject of Rome Is it not
time

But not choosing doubtless to begin a more explicit conversation with
the young doctor the prelate resumed We will talk of this hereafter
But tell me since my last visit has the reverend father had any fresh
attacks of delirium

Yes my lord here is the note as your Eminence commanded So saying
Rousselet delivered a paper to the prelate We will inform the reader
that this part of the conversation between Rousselet and the cardinal
was carried on at a distance from the partition so that Rodin could
hear nothing of it whilst that which related to the embalming had been
perfectly audible to him

The cardinal having received the note from Rousselet perused it with
an expression of lively curiosity When he had finished he crumpled
it in his hand and said without attempting to dissemble his vexation
Always nothing but incoherent expression Not two words together from
which you can draw any reasonable conclusion One would really think
this man had the power to control himself even in his delirium and to
rave about insignificant matters only

Then addressing Rousselet You are sure that you have reported
everything that escaped from him during his delirium

With the exception of the same phrases that he repeated over and over
again your Eminence may be assured that I have not omitted a single
word however unmeaning

Show me into Father Rodins room said the prelate after a moments
silence

But my lord answered the young doctor with some hesitation the
fit has only left him about an hour and the reverend father is still
very weak

The more the reason replied the prelate somewhat indiscreetly
Then recollecting himself he added He will the better appreciate
the consolations I have to offer Should he be asleep awake him and
announce my visit

I have only orders to receive from your Eminence said Rousselet
bowing and entering the next room

Left alone the cardinal said to himself with a pensive air I always
come back to that When he was suddenly attacked by the cholera Father
Rodin believed himself poisoned by order of the Holy See He must then
have been plotting something very formidable against Rome to entertain
so abominable a fear Can our suspicions be well founded Is he acting
secretly and powerfully on the Sacred College But then for what end
This it has been impossible to penetrate so faithfully has the secret
been kept by his accomplices I had hoped that during his delirium he
would let slip some word that would put us on the trace of what we are
so much interested to discover With so restless and active a mind
delirium is often the exaggeration of some dominant idea yet here I
have the report of five different fitsand nothingno nothing but
vague unconnected phrases

The return of Rousselet put an end to these reflections I am sorry to
inform my lord that the reverend father obstinately refuses to see any
one He says that he requires absolute repose Though very weak he has
a savage and angry look and I should not be surprised if he overheard
your Eminence talk about embalming him

The cardinal interrupting Rousselet said to him Did Father Rodin
have his last fit of delirium in the night

Between three and halfpast five this morning my lord

Between three and halfpast five repeated the prelate as if he
wished to impress this circumstance on his memory the attack presented
no particular symptoms

No my lord it consisted of rambling incoherent talk as your
Eminence may see by this note

Then as he perceived the prelate approaching Father Rodins door
Rousselet added The reverend father will positively see no one
my lord he requires rest to prepare for the operation it might be
dangerous

Without attending to these observations the cardinal entered Rodins
chamber It was a tolerably large room lighted by two windows and
simply but commodiously furnished Two logs were burning slowly in the
fireplace in which stood a coffeepot a vessel containing mustard
poultice etc On the chimneypiece were several pieces of rag and some
linen bandages The room was full of that faint chemical odor peculiar
to the chambers of the sick mingled with so putrid a stench that the
cardinal stopped at the door a moment before he ventured to advance
further As the three reverend fathers had mentioned in their walk
Rodin lived because he had said to himself I want to live and I will
live

For as men of timid imaginations and cowardly minds often die from the
mere dread of dying so a thousand facts prove that vigor of character
and moral energy may often struggle successfully against disease and
triumph over the most desperate symptoms

It was thus with the Jesuit The unshaken firmness of his character the
formidable tenacity of his will for the will has sometimes a mysterious
and almost terrific power aiding the skillful treatment of Dr
Baleinier had saved him from the pestilence with which he had been so
suddenly attacked But the shock had been succeeded by a violent fever
which placed Rodins life in the utmost peril This increased danger had
caused the greatest alarm to Father dAigrigny who felt in spite of
his rivalry and jealousy that Rodin was the masterspirit of the plot
in which they were engaged and could alone conduct it to a successful
issue

The curtains of the room was half closed and admitted only a doubtful
light to the bed on which Rodin was lying The Jesuits features
had lost the greenish hue peculiar to cholera patients but remained
perfectly livid and cadaverous and so thin that the dry rugged skin
appeared to cling to the smallest prominence of bone The muscles and
veins of the long lean vulturelike neck resembled a bundle of cords
The head covered with an old black filthy nightcap from beneath
which strayed a few thin gray hairs rested upon a dirty pillow for
Rodin would not allow them to change his linen His irongray beard had
not been shaved for some time and stood out like the hairs of a brush
Under his shirt he wore an old flannel waistcoat full of holes He had
one of his arms out of bed and his bony hairy hand with its bluish
nails held fast a cotton handkerchief of indescribable color

You might have taken him for a corpse had it not been for the two
brilliant sparks which still burned in the depths of his eyes In that
look in which seemed concentrated all the remaining life and energy
of the man you might read the most restless anxiety Sometimes his
features revealed the sharpest pangs sometimes the twisting of his
hands and his sudden starts proclaimed his despair at being thus
fettered to a bed of pain whilst the serious interests which he had
in charge required all the activity of his mind Thus with thoughts
continually on the stretch his mind often wandered and he had fits
of delirium from which he woke as from a painful dream By the prudent
advice of Dr Baleinier who considered him not in a state to attend to
matters ofimportance Father dAigrigny had hitherto evaded Rodins
questions with regard to the Rennepont affair which he dreaded to see
lost and ruined in consequence of his forced inaction The silence of
Father dAigrigny on this head and the ignorance in which they kept
him only augmented the sick mans exasperation Such was the moral and
physical state of Rodin when Cardinal Malipieri entered his chamber
against his will




CHAPTER XXVII THE LURE

To understand fully the tortures of Rodin reduced to inactivity by
sickness and to explain the importance of Cardinal Malipieris visit
we must remember the audacious views of the ambitious Jesuit who
believed himself following in the steps of Sixtus V and expected to
become his equal By the success of the Rennepont affair to attain to
the generalship of his Order by the corruption of the Sacred College
to ascend the pontifical throne and then by means of a change in the
statutes of the Company to incorporate the Society of Jesus with the
Holy See instead of leaving it independent to equal and almost always
rule the Papacysuch were the secret projects of Rodin

Their possibility was sanctioned by numerous precedents for many mere
monks and priests had been suddenly raised to the pontifical dignity
And as for their morality the accession of the Borgias of Julius
II and other dubious Vicars of Christ might excuse and authorize the
pretensions of the Jesuits

Though the object of his secret intrigues at Rome had hitherto been
enveloped in the greatest mystery suspicions had been excited in regard
to his private communications with many members of the Sacred College
A portion of that college Cardinal Malipieri at the head of them had
become very uneasy on the subject and profiting by his journey
to France the cardinal had resolved to penetrate the Jesuits dark
designs If in the scene we have just painted the cardinal showed
himself so obstinately bent on having a conference with Rodin in spite
of the refusal of the latter it was because the prelate hoped as we
shall soon see to get by cunning at the secret which had hitherto
been so well concealed It was therefore in the midst of all these
extraordinary circumstances that Rodin saw himself the victim of a
malady which paralyzed his strength at the moment when he had need of
all his activity and of all the resources of his mind After remaining
for some seconds motionless near the door the cardinal still holding
his bottle under his nose slowly approached the bed where Rodin lay

The latter enraged at this perseverance and wishing to avoid an
interview which for many reasons was singularly odious to him turned
his face towards the wall and pretended to be asleep Caring little for
this feint and determined to profit by Rodins state of weakness the
prelate took a chair and conquering his repugnance sat down close to
the Jesuits bed

My reverend and very dear father how do you find yourself said he to
him in a honeyed tone which his Italian accent seemed to render still
more hypocritical Rodin pretended not to hear breathed hard and made
no answer But the cardinal not without disgust shook with his gloved
hand the arm of the Jesuit and repeated in a louder voice My reverend
and very dear father answer me I conjure you

Rodin could not restrain a movement of angry impatience but he
continued silent The cardinal was not a man to be discouraged by so
little he again shook the arm of the Jesuit somewhat more roughly
repeating with a passionless tenacity that would have incensed the most
patient person in the world My reverend and very dear father since
you are not asleep listen to me I entreat of you

Irritable with pain exasperated by the obstinacy of the prelate Rodin
abruptly turned his head fixed on the Roman his hollow eyes shining
with lurid fire and with lips contracted by a sardonic smile said to
him bitterly You must be very anxious my lord to see me embalmed
and lie in state with tapers as you were saying just now for you thus
to come to torment me in my last moments and hasten my end

Oh my good father how can you talk so cried the cardinal raising
his hands as if to call heaven to witness to the sincerity of the tender
interest he felt for the Jesuit

I tell you that I heard all just now my lord for the partition is
thin added Rodin with redoubled bitterness

If you mean that from the bottom of my soul I desired that you should
make an exemplary and Christian end you are perfectly right my dear
father I did say so for after a life so well employed it would be
sweet to see you an object of adoration for the faithful

I tell you my lord cried Rodin in a weak and broken voice that
it is ferocious to express such wishes in the presence of a dying man
Yes he added with growing animation that contrasted strongly with
his weakness take care what you do for if I am too much plagued and
pesteredif I am not allowed to breathe my last breath quietlyI give
you notice that you will force me to die in anything but a Christian
manner and if you mean to profit by an edifying spectacle you will be
deceived

This burst of anger having greatly fatigued Rodin his head fell back
upon the pillow and he wiped his cracked and bleeding lips with his old
cotton handkerchief

Come come be calm my very dear father resumed the cardinal with
a patronizing air do not give way to such gloomy ideas Doubtless
Providence reserves you for great designs since you have been already
delivered from so much peril Let us hope that you will be likewise
saved from your present danger

Rodin answered by a hoarse growl and turned his face towards the wall

The imperturbable prelate continued The views of Providence are not
confined to your salvation my very dear father Its power has been
manifested in another way What I am about to tell you is of the highest
importance Listen attentively

Without turning his head Rodin muttered in a tone of angry bitterness
which betrayed his intense sufferings They desire my death My chest
is on fire my head racked with pain and they have no pity Oh I
suffer the tortures of the damned

What already thought the Roman with a smile of sarcastic malice
then he said aloud Let me persuade you my very dear fathermake an
effort to listen to me you will not regret it

Still stretched upon the bed Rodin lifted his hands clasped upon his
cotton handkerchief with a gesture of despair and then let them fall
again by his side

The cardinal slightly shrugged his shoulders and laid great stress
on what follows so that Rodin might not lose a word of it My dear
father it has pleased Providence that during your fit of raving you
have made without knowing it the most important revelations

The prelate waited with anxious curiosity for the effect of the pious
trap he had laid for the Jesuits weakened faculties But the latter
still turned towards the wall did not appear to have heard him and
remained silent

You are no doubt reflecting on my words my dear father resumed
the cardinal you are right for it concerns a very serious affair I
repeat to you that Providence has allowed you during your delirium to
betray your most secret thoughtshappily to me alone They are such
as would compromise you in the highest degree In short during your
delirium of last night which lasted nearly two hours you unveiled the
secret objects of your intrigues at Rome with many of the members of the
Sacred College

The cardinal rising softly stooped over the bed to watch the
expression of Rodins countenance But the latter did not give him time
As a galvanized corpse starts into strange and sudden motion Rodin
sprang into a sitting posture at the last words of the prelate

He has betrayed himself said the cardinal in a low voice in
Italian Then resuming his seat he fixed on the Jesuit his eyes that
sparkled with triumphant joy

Though he did not hear the exclamation of Malipieri nor remark the
expression of his countenance Rodin notwithstanding his state of
weakness instantly felt the imprudence of his start He pressed his
hand to his forehead as though he had been seized with a giddiness
then looking wildly round him he pressed to his trembling lips his old
cotton handkerchief and gnawed it mechanically for some seconds

Your emotion and alarm confirm the sad discoveries I have made
resumed the cardinal still more rejoicing at the success of his trick
and now my dear father added he you will understand that it is
for your best interest to enter into the most minute detail as to your
projects and accomplices at Rome You may then hope my dear father
for the indulgence of the Holy Seethat is if your avowals are
sufficiently explicit to fill up the chasms necessarily left in a
confession made during delirium

Rodin recovered from his first surprise perceived but too late that
he had fallen into a snare not by any words he had spoken but by his
too significant movements In fact the Jesuit had feared for a moment
that he might have betrayed himself during his delirium when he heard
himself accused of dark intrigues with Rome but after some minutes of
reflection his common sense suggested If this crafty Roman knew my
secret he would take care not to tell me so He has only suspicions
confirmed by my involuntary start just now

Rodin wiped the cold sweat from his burning forehead The emotion of
this scene augmented his sufferings and aggravated the danger of his
condition Worn out with fatigue he could not remain long in a sitting
posture and soon fell back upon the bed

Per Bacco said the cardinal to himself alarmed at the expression
of the Jesuits face if he were to die before he had spoken and so
escape the snare

Then leaning over the bed the prelate asked What is the matter my
very dear father

I am weak my lordI am in painI cannot express what I suffer

Let us hope my very dear father that this crisis will have no fatal
results but the contrary may happen and it behooves the salvation
of your soul to make instantly the fullest confession Were it even to
exhaust your strength what is this perishable body compared to eternal
life

Of what confession do you speak my lord said Rodin in a feeble and
yet sarcastic tone

What confession cried the amazed cardinal why with regard to your
dangerous intrigues at Rome

What intrigues asked Rodin

The intrigues you revealed during your delirium replied the prelate
with still more angry impatience Were not your avowals sufficiently
explicit Why then this culpable hesitation to complete them

My avowalswere explicityou assure me said Rodin pausing after
each word for want of breath but without losing his energy and presence
of mind

Yes I repeat it resumed the cardinal with the exception of a few
chasms they were most explicit

Then why repeat them said Rodin with the same sardonic smile on his
violet lips

Why repeat them cried the angry prelate In order to gain pardon
for if there is indulgence and mercy for the repentant sinner there
must be condemnation and curses for the hardened criminal

Oh what torture I am dying by slow fire murmured Rodin Since I
have told all he resumed I have nothing more to tell You know it
already

I know alldoubtless I know all replied the prelate in a voice of
thunder but how have I learned it By confessions made in a state
of unconsciousness Do you think they will avail you anything No the
moment is solemndeath is at hand tremble to die with a sacrilegious
falsehood on your lips cried the prelate shaking Rodin violently by
the arm dread the eternal flames if you dare deny what you know to be
the truth Do you deny it

I deny nothing murmured Rodin with difficulty Only leave me
alone

Then heaven inspires you said the cardinal with a sigh of
satisfaction and thinking he had nearly attained his object he
resumed Listen to the divine word that will guide you father You
deny nothing

I wasdeliriousand cannotoh how I suffer added Rodin by way
of parenthesis and cannot thereforedenythe nonsenseI may have
uttered

But when this nonsense agrees with the truth cried the prelate
furious at being again deceived in his expectation but when raving is
an involuntary providential revelation

Cardinal Malipieriyour craft is no matchfor my agony answered
Rodin in a failing voice The proofthat I have not told my
secretif I have a secretisthat you want to make me tell it In
spite of his pain and weakness the Jesuit had courage to raise himself
in the bed and look the cardinal full in the face with a smile of
bitter irony After which he fell back on the pillow and pressed his
hands to his chest with a long sigh of anguish

Damnation the infernal Jesuit has found me out said the cardinal
to himself as he stamped his foot with rage He sees that he was
compromised by his first movement he is now upon his guard I shall get
nothing more from himunless indeed profiting by the state of weakness
in which he is I can by entreaties by threats by terror

The prelate was unable to finish The door opened abruptly and Father
dAigrigny entered the room exclaiming with an explosion of joy
Excellent news




CHAPTER XXVIII GOOD NEWS

By the alteration in the countenance of Father dAigrigny his pale
cheek and the feebleness of his walk one might see that the terrible
scene in the square of NotreDame had violently reacted upon his
health Yet his face was radiant and triumphant as he entered Rodins
chamber exclaiming Excellent news

On these words Rodin started In spite of his weakness he raised his
head and his eyes shone with a curious uneasy piercing expression
With his lean hand he beckoned Father dAigrigny to approach the
bed and said to him in a broken voice so weak that it was scarcely
audible I am very illthe cardinal has nearly finished mebut if
this excellent newsrelates to the Rennepont affairof which I hear
nothingit might save me yet

Be saved then cried Father dAigrigny forgetting the recommendations
of Dr Baleinier read rejoice What you foretold is beginning to be
realized

So saying he drew a paper from his pocket and delivered it to Rodin
who seized it with an eager and trembling hand Some minutes before
Rodin would have been really incapable of continuing his conversation
with the cardinal even if prudence had allowed him to do so nor could
he have read a single line so dim had his sight become But at the
words of Father dAigrigny he felt such a renewal of hope and vigor
that by a mighty effort of energy and will he rose to a sitting
posture and with clear head and look of intelligent animation he
read rapidly the paper that Father dAigrigny had just delivered to him

The cardinal amazed at this sudden transfiguration asked himself if he
beheld the same man who a few minutes before had fallen back on
his bed almost insensible Hardly had Rodin finished reading than
he uttered a cry of stifled joy saying with an accent impossible to
describe ONE gone it workstis well And closing his eyes in
a kind of ecstatic transport a smile of proud triumph overspread his
face and rendered him still more hideous by discovering his yellow and
gumless teeth His emotion was so violent that the paper fell from his
trembling hand

He has fainted cried Father dAigrigny with uneasiness as he leaned
over Rodin It is my fault I forgot that the doctor cautioned me not
to talk to him of serious matters

No do not reproach yourself said Rodin in a low voice halfraising
himself in the bed This unexpected joy may perhaps cure me YesI
scarce know what I feelbut look at my cheeksit seems to me that
for the first time since I have been stretched on this bed of pain they
are a little warm

Rodin spoke the truth A slight color appeared suddenly on his livid and
icy cheeks his voice though still very weak became less tremulous and
he exclaimed in a tone of conviction that startled Father dAigrigny
and the prelate This first success answers for the others I read the
future Yes yes our cause will triumph Every member of the execrable
Rennepont family will be crushedand that soon you will see

Then pausing Rodin threw himself back on the pillow exclaiming Oh
I am choked with joy My voice fails me

But what is it asked the cardinal of Father dAigrigny

The latter replied in a tone of hypocritical sanctity One of the
heirs of the Rennepont family a poor fellow worn out with excesses and
debauchery died three days ago at the close of some abominable
orgies in which he had braved the cholera with sacrilegious impiety
In consequence of the indisposition that kept me at home and of another
circumstance I only received today the certificate of the death of
this victim of intemperance and irreligion I must proclaim it to the
praise of his reverencepointing to Rodinthat he told me the worst
enemies of the descendants of that infamous renegade would be their own
bad passions and that the might look to them as our allies against the
whole impious race And so it has happened with Jacques Rennepont

You see said Rodin in so faint a voice that it was almost
unintelligible the punishment begins already One of the Renneponts
is deadand believe methis certificate and he pointed to the paper
that Father dAigrigny held in his hand will one day be worth forty
millions to the Society of Jesusand thatbecause

The lips alone finished the sentence During some seconds Rodins
voice had become so faint that it was at last quite imperceptible His
larynx contracted by violent emotion no longer emitted any sound
The Jesuit far from being disconcerted by this incident finished his
phrase as it were by expressive pantomime Raising his head proudly he
tapped his forehead with his forefinger as if to express that it was to
his ability this first success was owing But he soon fell back again
on the bed exhausted breathless sinking with his cotton handkerchief
pressed once more to his parched lips The good news as Father
dAigrigny called it had not cured Rodin For a moment only he had had
the courage to forget his pain But the slight color on his cheek soon
disappeared his face became once more livid His sufferings suspended
for a moment were so much increased in violence that he writhed
beneath the coverlet and buried his face in the pillow extending his
arms above his head and holding them stiff as bars of iron After this
crisis intense as it was rapid during which Father dAigrigny and the
prelate bent anxiously over him Rodin whose face was bathed in cold
sweat made a sign that he suffered less and that he wished to drink of
a potion to which he pointed Father dAigrigny fetched it for him
and while the cardinal held him up with marked disgust the abbe
administered a few spoonfuls of the potion which almost immediately
produced a soothing effect

Shall I call M Rousselet said Father dAigrigny when Rodin was once
more laid down in bed

Rodin shook his head then with a fresh effort he raised his right
hand opened it and pointed with his forefinger to a desk in a corner
of the room to signify that being no longer able to speak he wished
to write

I understand your reverence said Father dAigrigny but first
calm yourself Presently if you require it I will give you writing
materials

Two knocks at the outer door of the next room interrupted this scene
From motives of prudence Father dAigrigny had begged Rousselet to
remain in the first of the three rooms He now went to open the door
and Rousselet handed him a voluminous packet saying I beg pardon
for disturbing you father but I was told to let you have these papers
instantly

Thank you M Rousselet said Father dAigrigny do you know at what
hour Dr Baleinier will return

He will not be long father for he wishes to perform before night the
painful operation that will have a decisive effect on the condition of
Father Rodin I am preparing what is necessary for it added Rousselet
as he pointed to a singular and formidable apparatus which Father
dAigrigny examined with a kind of terror

I do not know if the symptom is a serious one said the Jesuit but
the reverend father has suddenly lost his voice

It is the third time this has happened within the last week said
Rousselet the operation of Dr Baleiner will act both on the larynx
and on the lungs

Is the operation a very painful one asked Father dAigrigny

There is perhaps none more cruel in surgery answered the young
doctor and Dr Baleinier has partly concealed its nature from Father
Rodin

Please to wait here for Dr Baleinier and send him to us as soon as he
arrives resumed Father dAigrigny and returning to the sick chamber
he sat down by the bedside and said to Rodin as he showed him the
letter Here are different reports with regard to different members
of the Rennepont family whom I have had looked after by others my
indisposition having kept me at home for the last few days I do not
know father if the state of your health will permit you to hear

Rodin made a gesture at once so supplicating and peremptory that
Father dAigrigny felt there would be at least as much danger in
refusing as in granting his request so turning towards the cardinal
still inconsolable at not having discovered the Jesuits secret he
said to him with respectful deference pointing at the same time to the
letter Have I the permission of your Eminence

The prelate bowed and replied Your affairs are ours my dear father
The Church must always rejoice in what rejoices your glorious Company

Father dAigrigny unsealed the packet and found in it different notes
in different handwritings When he had read the first his countenance
darkened and he said in a grave tone A misfortunea great
misfortune

Rodin turned his head abruptly and looked at him with an air of uneasy
questioning

Florine is dead of the cholera answered Father dAigrigny and what
is the worst added he crumpling the note between his hands before
dying the miserable creature confessed to Mdlle de Cardoville that she
long acted as a spy under the orders of your reverence

No doubt the death of Florine and the confession she had made crossed
some of the plans of Rodin for he uttered an inarticulate murmur and
his countenance expressed great vexation

Passing to another note Father dAigrigny continued This relates
to Marshal Simon and is not absolutely bad but still far from
satisfactory as it announces some amelioration in his position We
shall see if it merits belief by information from another source

Rodin made a sign of impatience to hasten Father dAigrigny to read the
note which he did as follows For some days the mind of the marshal
has appeared to be less sorrowful anxious and agitated He lately
passed two hours with his daughters which had not been the case for
some time before The harsh countenance of the soldier Dagobert is
becoming smoothera sure sign of some amelioration in the condition of
the marshal Detected by their handwriting the last anonymous letters
were returned by Dagobert to the postman without having been opened by
the marshal Some other method must be found to get them delivered

Looking at Rodin Father dAigrigny said to him Your reverence thinks
with me that this note is not very satisfactory

Rodin held down his head One saw by the expression of his countenance
how much he suffered by not being able to speak Twice he put his hand
to his throat and looked at Father dAigrigny with anguish

Oh cried Father dAigrigny angrily when he had perused another
note for one lucky chance today brings some very black ones

At these words turning hastily to Father dAigrigny and extending
his trembling hands Rodin questioned him with look and gesture The
cardinal sharing his uneasiness exclaimed What do you learn by this
note my dear father

We thought the residence of M Hardy in our house completely unknown
replied Father dAigrigny but we now fear that Agricola Baudoin
has discovered the retreat of his old master and that he has even
communicated with him by letter through a servant of the house So
added the reverend father angrily during the three days that I have
not been able to visit the pavilion one of my servants must have been
bought over There is one of them a man blind of one eye whom I
have always suspectedthe wretch But no I will not yet believe this
treachery The consequences would be too deplorable for I know how
matters stand and that such a correspondence might ruin everything
By awaking in M Hardy memories with difficulty laid asleep they might
destroy in a single day all that has been done since he inhabits our
house Luckily this note contains only doubts and fears my other
information will be more positive and will not I hope confirm them

My dear father said the cardinal do not despair The Lord will not
abandon the good cause

Father dAigrigny seemed very little consoled by this assurance He
remained still and thoughtful whilst Rodin writhed his head in a
paroxysm of mute rage as he reflected on this new check

Let us turn to the last note said Father dAigrigny after a moment
of thoughtful silence I have so much confidence in the person who
sends it that I cannot doubt the correctness of the information it
contains May it contradict the others

In order not to break the chain of facts contained in this last note
which was to have so startling an effect on the actors in this scene we
shall leave it to the readers imagination to supply the exclamations
of surprise hate rage and fear of Father dAigrigny and the terrific
pantomime of Rodin during the perusal of this formidable document
the result of the observations of a faithful and secret agent of
the reverend fathers Comparing this note with the other information
received the results appeared more distressing to the reverend fathers
Thus Gabriel had long and frequent conferences with Adrienne who before
was unknown to him Agricola Baudoin had opened a communication with
Francis Hardy and the officers of justice were on the track of the
authors and instigators of the riot which had led to the burning of the
factory of Baron Tripeauds rival It seemed almost certain that Mdlle
de Cardoville had had an interview with Prince Djalma

This combination of facts showed that faithful to the threats she
had uttered to Rodin when she had unmasked the double perfidy of the
reverend father Mdlle de Cardoville was actively engaged in uniting
the scattered members of her family to form a league against those
dangerous enemies whose detestable projects once unveiled and boldly
encountered could hardly have a chance of success The reader will now
understand the tremendous effect of this note on Father dAigrigny and
Rodinon Rodin stretched powerless on a bed of pain at the moment when
the scaffolding raised with so much labor seemed to be tumbling around
him




CHAPTER XXIX THE OPERATION

We have given up the attempt to paint the countenance attitude and
gesticulation of Rodin during the reading of this note which seemed to
ruin all his most cherished hopes Everything was failing at once at
the moment when only superhuman trust in the success of his plans could
give him sufficient energy to strive against mortal sickness A single
absorbing thought had agitated him even to delirium What progress
during his illness had been made in this immense affair He had first
heard a good piece of news the death of Jacques Rennepont but now the
advantages of this decease which reduced the number of the heirs from
seven to six were entirely lost To what purpose would be this death
if the other members of the family dispersed and persecuted with such
infernal perseverance were to unite and discover the enemies who had
so long aimed at them in darkness If all those wounded hearts were to
console enlighten support each other their cause would be gained and
the inheritance rescued from the reverend fathers What was to be done

Strange power of the human willRodin had one foot in the grave he
was almost at the last gasp his voice had failed him And yet that
obstinate nature so full of energy and resources did not despair
Let but a miracle restore his health and that firm confidence in the
success of his projects which has given him power to struggle against
disease tells him that he could yet save allbut then he must have
health and life Health life His physician does not know if he will
survive the shockif he can bear the painof a terrible operation
Health life and just now Rodin heard talk of the solemn funeral they
had prepared for him And yethealth life he will have them Yes he
has willed to liveand he has livedwhy should he not live longer He
will livebecause he has willed it

All that we have just written passed though Rodins mind in a second
His features convulsed by the mental torment he endured must have
assumed a very strange expression for Father dAigrigny and the
cardinal looked at him in silent consternation Once resolved to live
and to sustain a desperate struggle with the Rennepont family Rodin
acted in consequence For a few moments Father dAigrigny and the
prelate believed themselves under the influence of a dream By an effort
of unparalleled energy and as if moved by hidden mechanism Rodin
sprang from the bed dragging the sheet with him and trailing it like
a shroud behind his livid and fleshless body The room was cold the
face of the Jesuit was bathed in sweat his naked and bony feet left
their moist print upon the stones

What are you doing It is death cried Father dAigrigny rushing
towards Rodin to force him to lie down again

But the latter extending one of his skeleton arms as hard as iron
pushed aside Father dAigrigny with inconceivable vigor considering the
state of exhaustion in which he had so long been

He has the strength of a man in a fit of epilepsy said Father
dAigrigny recovering his balance

With a steady step Rodin advanced to the desk on which Dr Baleinier
daily wrote his prescriptions Seating himself before it the Jesuit
took pen and paper and began to write in a firm hand His calm slow
and sure movements had in them something of the deliberateness remarked
in somnambulists Mute and motionless hardly knowing whether they
dreamed or not the cardinal and Father dAigrigny remained staring at
the incredible coolness of Rodin who halfnaked continued to write
with perfect tranquillity

But father said the Abbe dAigrigny advancing towards him this is
madness

Rodin shrugged his shoulders stopped him with a gesture and made him a
sign to read what he had just written

The reverend father expected to see the ravings of a diseased brain but
he took the note whilst Rodin commenced another

My lord exclaimed Father dAigrigny read this

The cardinal read the paper and returning it to the reverend father
with equal amazement added It is full of reason ability and
resources We shall thus be able to neutralize the dangerous combination
of Abbe Gabriel and Mdlle de Cardoville who appear to be the most
formidable leaders of the coalition

It is really miraculous said Father dAigrigny

Oh my dear father whispered the cardinal shaking his head what
a pity that we are the only witnesses of this scene What an excellent
MIRACLE we could have made of it In one sense it is another Raising of
Lazarus

What an idea my lord answered Father dAigrigny in a low voice It
is perfectand we must not give it up

This innocent little plot was interrupted by Rodin who turning his
head made a sign to Father dAigrigny to approach and delivered to him
another sheet with this note attached To be executed within an hour

Having rapidly perused the paper Father dAigrigny exclaimed Right
I had not thought of that Instead of being fatal the correspondence
between Agricola and M Hardy may thus have the best results Really
added the reverend father in a low voice to the prelate while Rodin
continued to write I am quite confounded I readI seeand yet I can
hardly believe my eyes Just before exhausted and dyingand now
with his mind as clear and penetrating as ever Can this be one of the
phenomena of somnambulism in which the mind alone governs and sustains
the body

Suddenly the door opened and Dr Baleinier entered the room At sight
of Rodin seated halfnaked at the desk with his feet upon the cold
stones the doctor exclaimed in a tone of reproach and alarm But my
lordbut fatherit is murder to let the unhappy man do thisIf he
is delirious from fever he must have the straitwaistcoat and be tied
down in bed

So saying Dr Baleinier hastily approached Rodin and took him by the
arm Instead of finding the skin dry and chilly as he expected he
found it flexible almost damp Struck with surprise the doctor sought
to feel the pulse of the left hand which Rodin resigned to him whilst
he continued working with the right

What a prodigy cried the doctor as he counted Rodins pulse for
a week past and even this morning the pulse has been abrupt
intermittent almost insensible and now it is firm regularI am
really puzzledwhat then has happened I can hardly believe what
I see added the doctor turning towards Father dAigrigny and the
cardinal

The reverend father who had first lost his voice was next seized with
such furious and violent despair caused by the receipt of bad news
answered Father dAigrigny that we feared a moment for his life while
now on the contrary the reverend father has gained sufficient strength
to go to his desk and write for some minutes with a clearness of
argument and expression which has confounded both the cardinal and
myself

There is no longer any doubt of it cried the doctor The violent
despair has caused a degree of emotion which will admirably prepare
the reactive crisis that I am now almost certain of producing by the
operation

You persist in the operation whispered Father dAigrigny whilst
Rodin continued to write

I might have hesitated this morning but disposed as he now is for
it I must profit by the moment of excitement which will be followed by
greater depression

Then without the operation said the cardinal

This fortunate and unexpected crisis will soon be over and the
reaction may kill him my lord

Have you informed him of the serious nature of the operation

Pretty nearly my lord

But it is time to bring him to the point

That is what I will do my lord said Dr Baleinier and approaching
Rodin who continued to write he thus addressed him in a firm voice
My reverend father do you wish to be up and well in a week

Rodin nodded full of confidence as much as to say I am up already

Do not deceive yourself replied the doctor This crisis is
excellent but it will not last and if we would profit by it we must
proceed with the operation of which I have spoken to youor I tell you
plainly I answer for nothing after such a shock

Rodin was the more struck with these words as half an hour ago he had
experienced the short duration of the improvement occasioned by Father
dAigrignys good news and as already he felt increased oppression on
the chest

Dr Baleinier wishing to decide him added In a word father will
you live or die

Rodin wrote rapidly this answer which he gave to the doctor To live
I would let you cut me limb from limb I am ready for anything And he
made a movement to rise

I must tell you reverend father so as not to take you by surprise
added Dr Baleinier that this operation is cruelly painful

Rodin shrugged his shoulders and wrote with a firm hand Leave me my
head you may take all the rest

The doctor read these words aloud and the cardinal and Father
dAigrigny looked at each other in admiration of this dauntless courage

Reverend father said Dr Baleinier you must lie down

Rodin wrote Get everything ready I have still some orders to write
Let me know when it is time

Then folding up a paper which he had sealed with a wafer Rodin gave
these words to Father dAigrigny Send this note instantly to the agent
who addressed the anonymous letters to Marshal Simon

Instantly reverend father replied the abbe I will employ a sure
messenger

Reverend father said Baleinier to Rodin since you must write lie
down in bed and write there during our little preparations

Rodin made an affirmative gesture and rose But already the prognostics
of the doctor were realized The Jesuit could hardly remain standing for
a second he fell back into a chair and looked at Dr Baleinier with
anguish whilst his breathing became more and more difficult

The doctor said to him Do not be uneasy But we must make haste Lean
upon me and Father dAigrigny

Aided by these two supporters Rodin was able to regain the bed Once
there he made signs that they should bring him pen ink and paper
Then he continued to write upon his knees pausing from time to time to
breathe with great difficulty

Reverend father said Baleinier to dAigrigny are you capable of
acting as one of my assistants in the operation Have you that sort of
courage

No said the reverend father in the army I could never assist at an
amputation The sight of blood is too much for me

There will be no blood said the doctor but it will be worse Please
send me three of our reverend fathers to assist me and ask M Rousselet
to bring in the apparatus

Father dAigrigny went out The prelate approached the doctor and
whispered pointing to Rodin Is he out of danger

If he stands the operationyes my lord

Are you sure that he can stand it

To him I should say yes to you I hope so

And were he to die would there be time to administer the sacraments in
public with a certain pomp which always causes some little delay

His dying may continue my lorda quarter of an hour

It is short but we must be satisfied with that said the prelate

And going to one of the windows he began to tap with his fingers on
the glass while he thought of the illumination effects in the event of
Rodins lying in state At this moment Rousselet entered with a large
square box under his arm He placed it on the drawers and began to
arrange his apparatus

How many have you prepared said the doctor

Six sir

Four will do but it is well to be fully provided The cotton is not
too thick

Look sir

Very good

And how is the reverend father asked the pupil

Humph answered the doctor in a whisper The chest is terribly
clogged the respiration hissing the voice gonestill there is a
change

All my fear is sir that the reverend father will not be able to stand
the dreadful pain

It is another chance but under the circumstances we must risk all
Come my dear boy light thetaper I hear our assistants

Just then Father dAigrigny entered the room accompanied by the three
Jesuits who in the morning had walked in the garden The two old men
with their rosy cheeks and the young one with the ascetic countenance
all three dressed in black with their square caps and white bands
appeared perfectly ready to assist Dr Baleinier in his formidable
operation




CHAPTER XXX THE TORTURE

Reverend fathers said Dr Baleinier graciously to the three I
thank you for your kind aid What you have to do is very simple and
by the blessing of heaven this operation will save the life of our dear
Father Rodin

The three blackgowns cast up their eyes piously and then bowed
altogether like one man Rodin indifferent to what was passing around
him never ceased an instant to write or reflect Nevertheless in spite
of his apparent calmness he felt such difficulty in breathing that
more than once Dr Baleinier had turned round uneasily as he heard the
stifled rattling in the throat of the sick man Making a sign to his
pupil the doctor approached Rodin and said to him Come reverend
father this is the important moment Courage

No sign of alarm was expressed in the Jesuits countenance His features
remained impassible as those of a corpse Only his little reptile eyes
sparkled still more brightly in their dark cavities For a moment
he looked round at the spectators of this scene then taking his pen
between his teeth he folded and wafered another letter placed it on
the table beside the bed and nodded to Dr Baleinier as if to say I
am ready

You must take off your flannel waistcoat and your shirt father
Rodin hesitated an instant and the doctor resumed It is absolutely
necessary father

Aided by Baleinier Rodin obeyed whilst the doctor added no doubt to
spare his modesty We shall only require the chest right and left my
dear father

And now Rodin stretched upon his back with his dirty nightcap still
on his head exposed the upper part of a livid trunk or rather the
bony cage of a skeleton for the shadows of the ribs and cartilages
encircled the skin with deep black lines As for the arms they
resembled bones twisted with cord and covered with tanned parchment

Come M Rousselet the apparatus said Baleinier

Then addressing the three Jesuits he added Please draw near
gentlemen what you have to do is very simple as you will see

It was indeed very simple The doctor gave to each of his four
assistants a sort of little steel tripod about two inches in diameter
and three in height the circular centre of this tripod was filled with
cotton the instrument was held in the left hand by means of a wooden
handle In the right hand each assistant held a small tin tube about
eighteen inches long at one end was a mouthpiece to receive the lips
of the operator and the other spread out so as to form a cover to the
little tripod These preparations had nothing alarming in them Father
dAigrigny and the prelate who looked on from a little distance
could not understand how this operation should be so painful They soon
understood it

Dr Baleinier having thus provided his four assistants made them
approach Rodin whose bed had been rolled into the middle of the room
Two of them were placed on one side two on the other

Now gentlemen said Dr Baleinier set light to the cotton place
the lighted part on the skin of his reverence by means of the tripod
which contains the wick cover the tripod with the broad part of the
tube and then blow through the other end to keep up the fire It is
very simple as you see

It was in fact full of the most patriarchal and primitive ingenuity
Four lighted cotton rocks so disposed as to burn very slowly were
applied to the two sides of Rodins chest This is vulgarly called the
moxa The trick is done when the whole thickness of the skin has been
burnt slowly through It lasts seven or eight minutes They say that
an amputation is nothing to it Rodin had watched the preparations
with intrepid curiosity But at the first touch of the four fires
he writhed like a serpent without being able to utter a cry Even the
expression of pain was denied him The four assistants being disturbed
by the sudden start of Rodin it was necessary to begin again

Courage my dear father offer these sufferings to the Lord said Dr
Baleinier in a sanctified tone I told you the operation would be
very painful but then it is salutary in proportion Come you that have
shown such decisive resolution do not fail at the last movement

Rodin had closed his eyes conquered by the first agony of pain He now
opened them and looked at the doctor as if ashamed of such weakness
And yet on the sides of his chest were four large bleeding woundsso
violent had been the first singe As he again extended himself on the
bed of torture Rodin made a sign that he wished to write The doctor
gave him the pen and he wrote as follows by way of memorandum It is
better not to lose any time Inform Baron Tripeaud of the warrant issued
against Leonard so that he may be on his guard

Having written this note the Jesuit gave it to Dr Baleinier to hand
it to Father dAigrigny who was as much amazed as the doctor and the
cardinal at such extraordinary presence of mind in the midst of such
horrible pain Rodin with his eyes fixed on the reverend father seemed
to wait with impatience for him to leave the room to execute his orders
Guessing the thought of Rodin the doctor whispered Father dAigrigny
who went out

Come reverend father said the doctor we must begin again This
time do not move

Rodin did not answer but clasped his hands over his head closed his
eyes and presented his chest It was a strange lugubrious almost
fantastic spectacle The three priests in their long black gowns
leaned over this body which almost resembled a corpse and blowing
through their tubes into the chest of the patient seemed as if pumping
up his blood by some magic charm A sickening odor of burnt flesh began
to spread through the silent chamber and each assistant heard a slight
crackling beneath the smoking trivet it was the skin of Rodin giving
way to the action of fire and splitting open in four different parts of
his chest The sweat poured from his livid face which it made to shine
a few locks of his gray hair stood up stiff and moist from his temples
Sometimes the spasms were so violent that the veins swelled on his
stiffened arms and were stretched like cords ready to break

Enduring this frightful torture with as much intrepid resignation as
the savage whose glory consists in despising pain Rodin gathered his
strength and courage from the hopewe had almost said the certaintyof
life Such was the make of this dauntless character such the energy of
this powerful mind that in the midst of indescribable torments
his one fixed idea never left him During the rare intervals of
sufferingfor pain is equal even at this degree of intensityRodin
still thought of the Rennepont inheritance and calculated his chances
and combined his measures feeling that he had not a minute to lose Dr
Baleinier watched him with extreme attention waiting for the effects
of the reaction of pain upon the patient who seemed already to breathe
with less difficulty

Suddenly Rodin placed his hand on his forehead as if struck with some
new idea and turning his head towards Dr Baleinier made a sign to him
to suspend the operation

I must tell you reverend father answered the doctor that it is not
half finished and if we leave off the renewal will be more painful

Rodin made a sign that he did not care and that he wanted to write

Gentlemen stop a moment said Dr Baleinier keep down your moxas
but do not blow the fire

So the fire was to burn slowly instead of fiercely but still upon
the skin of the patient In spite of this pain less intense but still
sharp and keen Rodin stretched upon his back began to write holding
the paper above his head On the first sheet he traced some alphabetic
signs part of a cipher known to himself alone In the midst of the
torture a luminous idea had crossed his mind fearful of forgetting it
amidst his sufferings he now took note of it On another paper he wrote
the following which was instantly delivered to Father dAigrigny Send
B immediately to Faringhea for the report of the last few days with
regard to Djalma and let B bring it hither on the instant Father
dAigrigny went out to execute this new order The cardinal approached
a little nearer to the scene of the operation for in spite of the bad
odor of the room he took delight in seeing the Jesuit half roasted
having long cherished against him the rancor of an Italian and a priest

Come reverend father said the doctor to Rodin continue to be
admirably courageous and your chest will free itself You have still a
bitter moment to go throughand then I have good hope

The patient resumed his former position The moment Father dAigrigny
returned Rodin questioned him with a look to which the reverend father
replied by a nod At a sign from the doctor the four assistants began
to blow through the tubes with all their might This increase of torture
was so horrible that in spite of his selfcontrol Rodin gnashed his
teeth started convulsively and so expanded his palpitating chest
that after a violent spasm there rose from his throat and lungs a
scream of terrific painbut it was free loud sonorous

The chest is free cried the doctor in triumph The lungs have
playthe voice returnshe is savedBlow gentlemen blow and
reverend father cry out as much as you please I shall be delighted to
hear you for it will give you relief Courage I answer for the result
It is a wonderful cure I will publish it by sound of trumpet

Allow me doctor whispered Father dAigrigny as he approached Dr
Baleinier the cardinal can witness that I claimed beforehand the
publication of this affairas a miraculous fact

Let it be miraculous then answered Dr Baleinier disappointedfor
he set some value on his own work

On hearing he was saved Rodin though his sufferings were perhaps worse
than ever for the fire had now pierced the scarfskin assumed almost
an infernal beauty Through the painful contraction of his features
shone the pride of savage triumph the monster felt that he was becoming
once more strong and powerful and he seemed conscious the evils that
his fatal resurrection was to cause And so of still writhing beneath
the flames he pronounced these words the first that struggled from his
chest I told you I should live

You told us true cried the doctor feeling his pulse the
circulation is now full and regular the lungs are free The reaction is
complete You are saved

At this moment the last shreds of cotton had burnt out The trivets
were withdrawn and on the skeleton trunk of Rodin were seen four large
round blisters The skin still smoked and the raw flesh was visible
beneath In one of his sudden movements a lamp had been misplaced and
one of these burns was larger than the other presenting as it were to
the eye a double circle Rodin looked down upon his wounds After
some seconds of silent contemplation a strange smile curled his lips
Without changing his position he glanced at Father dAigrigny with an
expression impossible to describe and said to him as he slowly
counted the wounds touching them with his flat and dirty nail
Father dAigrigny what an omenLook here one Renneponttwo
Rennepontsthree Rennepontsfour Rennepontswhere is then the
fifthAh herethis wound will count for two They are twins41
And he emitted a little dry bitter laugh Father dAigrigny the
cardinal and Dr Baleinier alone understood the sense of these
mysterious and fatal words which Rodin soon completed by a terrible
allusion as he exclaimed with prophetic voice and almost inspired
air Yes I say it The impious race will be reduced to ashes like
the fragments of this poor flesh I say it and it will be so I said I
would liveand I do live

41 Jacques Rennepont being dead and Gabriel out of the field in
consequence of his donation there remained only five persons of the
familyRose and Blanche Djalma Adrienne and Hardy




CHAPTER XXXI VICE AND VIRTUE

Two days have elapsed since Rodin was miraculously restored to life The
reader will not have forgotten the house in the Rue Clovis where the
reverend father had an apartment and where also was the lodging of
Philemon inhabited by RosePompon It is about three oclock in the
afternoon A bright ray of light penetrating through a round hole in
the door Mother Arsenes subterraneous shop forms a striking contrast
with the darkness of this cavern The ray streams full upon a melancholy
object In the midst of fagots and faded vegetables and close to a
great heap of charcoal stands a wretched bed beneath the sheet which
covers it can be traced the stiff and angular proportions of a corpse
It is the body of Mother Arsene herself who died two days before of
the cholera The burials have been so numerous that there has been
no time to remove her remains The Rue Clovis is almost deserted A
mournful silence reigns without often broken by the sharp whistling of
the north wind Between the squalls one hears a sort of pattering It
is the noise of the large rats running to and fro across the heap of
charcoal

Suddenly another sound is heard and these unclean animals fly to hide
themselves in their holes Some one is trying to force open the door
which communicates between the shop and the passage It offers but
little resistance and in a few seconds the wornout lock gives
way and a woman enters For a short time she stands motionless in the
obscurity of the damp and icy cave After a minutes hesitation the
woman advances and the ray of light illumines the features of the
Bacchanal Queen Slowly she approached the funeral couch Since the
death of Jacques the alteration in the countenance of Cephyse had gone
on increasing Fearfully pale with her fine black hair in disorder
her legs and feet naked she was barely covered with an old patched
petticoat and a very ragged handkerchief

When she came near the bed she cast a glance of almost savage assurance
at the shroud Suddenly she drew back with a low cry of involuntary
terror The sheet moved with a rapid undulation extending from the feet
to the head of the corpse But soon the sight of a rat flying along the
side of the wormeaten bedstead explained the movement of the shroud
Recovering from her fright Cephyse began to look for several things
and collected them in haste as though she dreaded being surprised
in the miserable shop First she seized a basket and filled it with
charcoal then looking from side to side she discovered in a corner an
earthen pot which she took with a burst of ominous joy

It is not all it is not all said Cephyse as she continued to search
with an unquiet air

At last she perceived near the stove a little tin box containing flint
steel and matches She placed these articles on the top of the basket
and took it in one hand and the earthen pot in the other As she
passed near the corpse of the poor charcoaldealer Cephyse said with a
strange smile I rob you poor Mother Arsene but my theft will not do
me much good

Cephyse left the shop reclosed the door as well as she could went up
the passage and crossed the little courtyard which separated the
front of the building from that part in which Rodin had lodged With the
exception of the windows of Philemons apartment where RosePompon had
so often sat perched like a bird warbling Beranger the other windows
of the house were open There had been deaths on the first and second
floors and like many others they were waiting for the cart piled up
with coffins

The Bacchanal Queen gained the stairs which led to the chambers
formerly occupied by Rodin Arrived at the landingplace she ascended
another ruinous staircase steep as a ladder and with nothing but an
old rope for a rail She at length reached the halfrotten door of
a garret situated in the roof The house was in such a state of
dilapidation that in many places the roof gave admission to the rain
and allowed it to penetrate into this cell which was not above ten feet
square and lighted by an attic window All the furniture consisted of
an old straw mattress laid upon the ground with the straw peeping out
from a rent in its ticking a small earthenware pitcher with the spout
broken and containing a little water stood by the side of this couch
Dressed in rags Mother Bunch was seated on the side of the mattress
with her elbows on her knees and her face concealed in her thin white
hands When Cephyse entered the room the adopted sister of Agricola
raised her head her pale mild face seemed thinner than ever hollow
with suffering grief misery her eyes red with weeping were fixed on
her sister with an expression of mournful tenderness

I have what we want sister said Cephyse in a low deep voice in
this basket there is wherewith to finish our misery

Then showing to Mother Bunch the articles she had just placed on the
floor she added For the first time in my life I have been a thief
It made me ashamed and frightened I was never intended for that or
worse It is a pity added she with a sardonic smile

After a moments silence the hunchback said to her sister in a heart
rending tone Cephysemy dear Cephyseare you quite determined to
die

How should I hesitate answered Cephyse in a firm voice Come
sister let us once more make our reckoning If even I could forget my
shame and Jacques contempt in his last moments what would remain to
me Two courses only first to be honest and work for my living But
you know that in spite of the best will in the world work will often
fail as it has failed for the last few days and even when I got it I
would have to live on four to five francs a week Live that is to say
die by inches I know that already and I prefer dying at once The
other course would be to live a life of infamyand that I will not do
Frankly sister between frightful misery infamy or death can the
choice be doubtful Answer me

Then without giving Mother Bunch time to speak Cephyse added in an
abrupt tone Besides what is the good of discussing it I have made up
my mind and nothing shall prevent my purpose since all that you dear
sister could obtain from me was a delay of a few days to see if the
cholera would not save us the trouble To please you I consented the
cholera has come killed every one else in the house but left us You
see it is better to do ones own business added she again smiling
bitterly Then she resumed Besides dear sister you also wish to
finish with life

It is true Cephyse answered the sempstress who seemed very much
depressed but aloneone has only to answer for ones selfand to die
with you added she shuddering appears like being an accomplice in
your death

Do you wish then to make an end of it I in one place you in
anotherthat would be agreeable said Cephyse displaying in that
terrible moment the sort of bitter and despairing irony which is more
frequent than may be imagined in the midst of mortal anguish

Oh no no said the other in alarm not aloneI will not die
alone

Do you not see dear sister we are right not to part And yet added
Cephyse in a voice of emotion my heart almost breaks sometimes to
think that you will die like me

How selfish said the hunchback with a faint smile What reasons
have I to love life What void shall I leave behind me

But you are a martyr sister resumed Cephyse The priests talk of
saints Is there one of them so good as you And yet you are about to
die like me who have always been idle careless sinfulwhile you were
so hardworking so devoted to all who suffered What should I say
You were an angel on the earth and yet you will die like me who have
fallen as low as a woman can fall added the unfortunate casting down
her eyes

It is strange answered Mother Bunch thoughtfully Starting from the
same point we have followed different roads and yet we have reached
the same goaldisgust of life For you my poor sister but a few days
ago life was so fair so full of pleasure and of youth and now it is
equally heavy with us both After all I have followed to the end what
was my duty added she mildly Agricola no longer needs me He is
married he loves and is beloved his happiness is secured Mdlle de
Cardoville wants for nothing Fair rich prosperouswhat could a poor
creature like myself do for her Those who have been kind to me are
happy What prevents my going now to my rest I am so weary

Poor sister said Cephyse with touching emotion which seemed to
expand her contracted features when I think that without informing
me and in spite of your resolution never to see that generous young
lady who protected you you yet had the courage to drag yourself to
her house dying with fatigue and want to try to interest her in my
fateyes dying for your strength failed on the ChampsElysees

And when I was able to reach the mansion Mdlle de Cardoville was
unfortunately absentvery unfortunately repeated the hunchback as
she looked at Cephyse with anguish for the next day seeing that our
last resource had failed us thinking more of me than of yourself and
determined at any price to procure us bread

She could not finish She buried her face in her hands and shuddered

Well I did as so many other hapless women have done when work fails or
wages do not suffice and hunger becomes too pressing replied Cephyse
in a broken voice only that unlike so many others instead of living
on my shame I shall die of it

Alas this terrible shame which kills you my poor Cephyse because you
have a heart would have been averted had I seen Mdlle de Cardoville
or had she but answered the letter which I asked leave to write to her
at the porters lodge But her silence proves to me that she is justly
hurt at my abrupt departure from her house I can understand it she
believes me guilty of the blackest ingratitudefor she must have been
greatly offended not to have deigned to answer meand therefore I had
not the courage to write a second time It would have been useless I am
sure for good and just as she is her refusals are inexorable when she
believes them deserved And besides for what good It was too late you
had resolved to die

Oh yes quite resolved for my infamy was gnawing at my heart Jacques
had died in my arms despising me and I loved himmark me sister
added Cephyse with passionate enthusiasm I loved him as we love only
once in life

Let our fate be accomplished then said Mother Bunch with a pensive
air

But you have never told me sister the cause of your departure from
Mdlle de Cardovilles resumed Cephyse after a moments silence

It will be the only secret that I shall take with me dear Cephyse
said the other casting down her eyes And she thought with bitter joy
that she would soon be delivered from the fear which had poisoned the
last days of her sad lifethe fear of meeting Agricola informed of the
fatal and ridiculous love she felt for him

For it must be said this fatal and despairing love was one of
the causes of the suicide of the unfortunate creature Since the
disappearance of her journal she believed that the blacksmith knew
the melancholy secret contained in its sad pages She doubted not
the generosity and good heart of Agricola but she had such doubts of
herself she was so ashamed of this passion however pure and
noble that even in the extremity to which Cephyse and herself were
reducedwanting work wanting breadno power on earth could have
induced her to meet Agricola in an attempt to ask him for assistance
Doubtless she would have taken another view of the subject if her mind
had not been obscured by that sort of dizziness to which the firmest
characters are exposed when their misfortunes surpass all bounds
Misery hunger the influence almost contagious in such a moment of
the suicidal ideas of Cephyse and weariness of a life so long devoted
to pain and mortification gave the last blow to the sewinggirls
reason After long struggling against the fatal design of her sister
the poor dejected brokenhearted creature finished by determining to
share Cephyses fate and seek in death the end of so many evils

Of what are you thinking sister said Cephyse astonished at the long
silence The other replied trembling I think of that which made me
leave Mdlle de Cardoville so abruptly and appear so ungrateful in her
eyes May the fatality which drove me from her house have made no other
victims may my devoted service however obscure and powerless never be
missed by her who extended her noble hand to the poor sempstress
and deigned to call me sister May she be happyoh ever happy said
Mother Bunch clasping her hands with the ardor of a sincere invocation

That is noble sistersuch a wish in such a moment said Cephyse

Oh said her sister with energy I loved I admired that marvel
of genius and heart and ideal beautyI viewed her with pious
respectfor never was the power of the Divinity revealed in a more
adorable and purer creation At least one of my last thoughts will have
been of her

Yes you will have loved and respected your generous patroness to the
last

To the last said the poor girl after a moments silence It is
trueyou are rightit will soon be the lastin a few moments all
will be finished See how calmly we can talk of that which frightens so
many others

Sister we are calm because we are resolved

Quite resolved Cephyse said the hunchback casting once more a deep
and penetrating glance upon her sister

Oh yes if you are only as determined as I am

Be satisfied if I put off from day to day the final moment answered
the sempstress it was because I wished to give you time to reflect As
for me

She did not finish but she shook her head with an air of the utmost
despondency

Well sister let us kiss each other said Cephyse and courage

The hunchback rose and threw herself into her sisters arms They held
one another fast in a long embrace There followed a few seconds of deep
and solemn silence only interrupted by the sobs of the sisters for now
they had begun to weep

Oh heaven to love each other so and to part forever said Cephyse
It is a cruel fate

To part cried Mother Bunch and her pale mild countenance bathed
in tears was suddenly illumined with a ray of divine hope to
part sister oh no What makes me so calm is the deep and certain
expectation which I feel here at my heart of that better world where a
better life awaits us God so great so merciful so prodigal of good
cannot destine His creatures to be forever miserable Selfish men may
pervert His benevolent designs and reduce their brethren to a state of
suffering and despair Let us pity the wicked and leave them Come up on
high sister men are nothing there where God is all We shall do well
there Let us depart for it is late

So saying she pointed to the ruddy beams of the setting sun which
began to shine upon the window

Carried away by the religious enthusiasm of her sister whose
countenance transfigured as it were by the hope of an approaching
deliverance gleamed brightly in the reflected sunset Cephyse took her
hands and looking at her with deep emotion exclaimed Oh sister
how beautiful you look now

Then my beauty comes rather late in the day said Mother Bunch with a
sad smile

No sister for you appear so happy that the last scruples I had upon
your account are quite gone

Then let us make haste said the hunchback as she pointed to the
chafingdish

Be satisfied sisterit will not be long said Cephyse And she took
the chafingdish full of charcoal which she had placed in a corner of
the garret and brought it out into the middle of the room

Do you know how to manage it asked the sewinggirl approaching

Oh it is very simple answered Cephyse we have only to close the
door and window and light the charcoal

Yes sister but I think I have heard that every opening must be well
stopped so as to admit no current of air

You are right and the door shuts so badly

And look at the holes in the roof

What is to be done sister

I will tell you said Mother Bunch The straw of our mattress well
twisted will answer every purpose

Certainly replied Cephyse We will keep a little to light our fire
and with the rest we will stop up all the crevices in the roof and make
filling for our doors and windows

Then smiling with that bitter irony so frequent we repeat in the
most gloomy moments Cephyse added I say sister weatherboards
at our doors and windows to prevent the air from getting inwhat a
luxury we are as delicate as rich people

At such a time we may as well try to make ourselves a little
comfortable said Mother Bunch trying to jest like the Bacchanal
Queen

And with incredible coolness the two began to twist the straw into
lengths of braid small enough to be stuffed into the cracks of the
door and also constructed large plugs destined to stop up the crevices
in the roof While this mournful occupation lasted there was no
departure from the calm and sad resignation of the two unfortunate
creatures




CHAPTER XXXII SUICIDE

Cephyse and her sister continued with calmness the preparations for
their death

Alas how many poor young girls like these sisters have been and
still will be fatally driven to seek in suicide a refuge from despair
from infamy or from a too miserable existence And upon society
will rest the terrible responsibility of these sad deaths so long as
thousands of human creatures unable to live upon the mockery of wages
granted to their labor have to choose between these three gulfs of
shame and woe a life of enervating toil and mortal privations causes
of premature death prostitution which kills also but slowlyby
contempt brutality and uncleanness suicidewhich kills at once

In a few minutes the two sisters had constructed with the straw of
their couch the calkings necessary to intercept the air and to render
suffocation more expeditious and certain

The hunchback said to her sister You are the taller Cephyse and must
look to the ceiling I will take care of the window and door

Be satisfied sister I shall have finished before you answered
Cephyse

And the two began carefully to stop up every crevice through which a
current of air could penetrate into the ruined garret Thanks to her
tall stature Cephyse was able to reach the holes in the roof and
to close them up entirely When they had finished this sad work the
sisters again approached and looked at each other in silence

The fatal moment drew near their faces though still calm seemed
slightly agitated by that strange excitement which always accompanies a
double suicide

Now said Mother Bunch now for the fire

She knelt down before the little chafingdish filled with charcoal But
Cephyse took hold of her under the arm and obliged her to rise again
saying to her Let me light the firethat is my business

But Cephyse

You know poor sister that the smell of charcoal gives you the
headache

At the simplicity of this speech for the Bacchanal Queen had spoken
seriously the sisters could not forbear smiling sadly

Never mind resumed Cephyse why suffer more and sooner than is
necessary

Then pointing to the mattress which still contained a little straw
Cephyse added Lie down there good little sister when our fire is
alight I will come and sit down by you

Do not be long Cephyse

In five minutes it will be done

The tall building which faced the street was separated by a narrow
court from that which contained the retreat of the two sisters and was
so much higher that when the sun had once disappeared behind its lofty
roof the garret soon became dark The light passing through the dirty
panes of the small window fell faintly on the blue and white patchwork
of the old mattress on which Mother Bunch was now stretched covered
with rags Leaning on her left arm with her chin resting in the palm
of her hand she looked after her sister with an expression of
heartrending grief Cephyse kneeling over the chafingdish with her
face close to the black charcoal above which already played a little
bluish flame exerted herself to blow the newlykindled fire which was
reflected on the pale countenance of the unhappy girl

The silence was deep No sound was heard but the panting breath of
Cephyse and at intervals the slight crackling of the charcoal which
began to burn and already sent forth a faint sickening vapor Cephyse
seeing the fire completely lighted and feeling already a little dizzy
rose from the ground and said to her sister as she approached her It
is done

Sister answered Mother Bunch kneeling on the mattress whilst
Cephyse remained standing how shall we place ourselves I should like
to be near you to the last

Stop said Cephyse half executing the measures of which she spoke
I will sit on the mattress with my back against the wall Now little
sister you lie there Lean your head upon my knees and give me your
hand Are you comfortable so

Yesbut I cannot see you

That is better It seems there is a momentvery short it is truein
which one suffers a good deal And added Cephyse in a voice of
emotion it will be as well not to see each other suffer

You are right Cephyse

Let me kiss that beautiful hair for the last time said Cephyse as
she pressed her lips to the silky locks which crowned the hunchbacks
pale and melancholy countenance and thenwe will remain very quiet

Sister your hand said the sewinggirl for the last time your
handand then as you say we will move no more We shall not have to
wait long I think for I begin to feel dizzy And you sister

Not yet replied Cephyse I only perceive the smell of the charcoal

Do you know where they will bury us said Mother Bunch after a
moments silence

No Why do you ask

Because I should like it to be in PerelaChaise I went there once
with Agricola and his mother What a fine view there isand then
the trees the flowers the marbledo you know the dead are better
lodgedthan the livingand

What is the matter sister said Cephyse to her companion who had
stopped short after speaking in a slow voice

I am giddymy temples throb was the answer How do you feel

I only begin to be a little faint it is strangethe effect is slower
with me than you

Oh you see said Mother Bunch trying to smile I was always so
forward At school do you remember they said I was before the others
And now it happens again

I hope soon to overtake you this time said Cephyse

What astonished the sisters was quite natural Though weakened by sorrow
and misery the Bacchanal Queen with a constitution as robust as the
other was frail and delicate was necessarily longer than her sister in
feeling the effects of the deleterious vapor After a moments silence
Cephyse resumed as she laid her hand on the head she still held upon
her knees You say nothing sister You suffer is it not so

No said Mother Bunch in a weak voice my eyelids are heavy as
leadI am getting benumbedI feel that I speak more slowlybut I have
no acute pain And you sister

Whilst you were speaking I felt giddyand now my temples throb
violently

As it was with me just now One would think it was more painful and
difficult to die

Then after a moments silence the hunchback said suddenly to her
sister Do you think that Agricola will much regret me and think of me
for some time

How can you ask said Cephyse in a tone of reproach

You are right answered Mother Bunch mildly there is a bad feeling
in such a doubtbut if you knew

What sister

The other hesitated for an instant and then said dejectedly
Nothing Afterwards she added Fortunately I die convinced that
he will never miss me He married a charming girl who loves him I am
sure and will make him perfectly happy

As she pronounced these last words the speakers voice grew fainter
and fainter Suddenly she started and said to Cephyse in a
trembling almost frightened tone Sister Hold me in your armsI am
afraideverything looks darkeverything is turning round And the
unfortunate girl raising herself a little hid her face in her sisters
bosom and threw his weak arms around her

Courage sister said Cephyse in a voice which was also growing
faint as she pressed her closer to her bosom it will soon be over

And Cephyse added with a kind of envy Oh why does my sisters
strength fail so much sooner than mine I have still my perfect
senses and I suffer less than she does Oh if I thought she would
die firstBut noI will go and hold my face over the chafingdish
rather

At the movement Cephyse made to rise a feeble pressure from her sister
held her back You suffer my poor child said Cephyse trembling

Oh yes a good deal nowdo not leave me

And I scarcely at all said Cephyse gazing wildly at the
chafingdish Ah added she with a kind of fatal joy now I begin
to feel itI chokemy head is ready to split

And indeed the destructive gas now filled the little chamber from which
it had by degrees driven all the air fit for respiration The day was
closing in and the gloomy garret was only lighted by the reflection of
the burning charcoal which threw a red glare on the sisters locked
in each others arms Suddenly Mother Bunch made some slight
convulsive movements and pronounced these words in a failing voice
AgricolaMademoiselle de CardovilleOh farewellAgricolaI

Then she murmured some unintelligible words the convulsive moments
ceased and her arms which had been clasped round Cephyse fell inert
upon the mattress

Sister cried Cephyse in alarm as she raised Mother Bunchs head to
look at her face Not already sisterAnd Iand I

The sewinggirls mild countenance was not paler than usual Only her
eyes halfclosed seemed no longer to see anything and a halfsmile
of mingled grief and goodness lingered an instant about her violet lips
from which stole the almost imperceptible breathand then the mouth
became motionless and the face assumed a great serenity of expression

But you must not die before me cried Cephyse in a heartrending
tone as she covered with kisses the cold cheek Wait for me sister
wait for me

Mother Bunch did not answer The head which Cephyse let slip from her
hands fell back gently on the mattress

My God It is not my fault if we do not die together cried Cephyse
in despair as she knelt beside the couch on which the other lay
motionless

Dead she murmured in terror Dead before mePerhaps it is that I
am the strongest Ah it beginsfortunatelylike her I see everything
darkblueI sufferwhat happinessI can scarcely breathe Sister
she added as she threw her arms round her loved ones neck I am
comingI am here

At the same instant the sound of footsteps and voices was heard from the
staircase Cephyse had still presence of mind enough to distinguish
the sound Stretched beside the body of her sister she raised her head
hastily

The noise approached and a voice was heard exclaiming not far from the
doer Good heavens what a smell of fire

And at the same instant the door was violently shaken and another
voice exclaimed Open open

They will come inthey will save meand my sister is deadOh no I
will not have the baseness to survive her

Such was the last thought of Cephyse Using what little strength she had
left she ran to the window and opened itand at the same instant
that the halfbroken door yielded to a vigorous effort from without the
unfortunate creature precipitated herself from that third story into the
court below Just then Adrienne and Agricola appeared on the threshold
of the chamber In spite of the stifling odor of the charcoal Mdlle de
Cardoville rushed into the garret and seeing the stove she exclaimed
The unhappy girl has killed herself

No she has thrown herself from the window cried Agricola for at
the moment of breaking open the door he had seen a human form disappear
in that direction and he now ran to the window

Oh this is frightful he exclaimed with a cry of horror as he put
his hand before his eyes and returned pale and terrified to Mdlle de
Cardoville

But misunderstanding the cause of his terror Adrienne who had just
perceived Mother Bunch through the darkness hastened to answer No
she is here

And she pointed to the pale form stretched on the mattress beside which
Adrienne now threw herself on her knees Grasping the hands of the poor
sempstress she found them as cold as ice Laying her hand on her heart
she could not feel it beat Yet in a few seconds as the fresh air
rushed into the room from the door and window Adrienne thought she
remarked an almost imperceptible pulsation and she exclaimed Her
heart beats Run quickly for help Luckily I have my smelling bottle

Yes yes help for herand for the other too if it is yet time
cried the smith in despair as he rushed down the stairs leaving Mdlle
de Cardoville still kneeling by the side of the mattress

CHAPTER XXXIII CONFESSIONS

During the painful scene that we have just described a lively emotion
glowed in the countenance of Mdlle de Cardoville grown pale and thin
with sorrow Her cheeks once so full were now slightly hollowed
whilst a faint line of transparent azure encircled those large black
eyes no longer so bright as formerly But the charming lips though
contracted by painful anxiety had retained their rich and velvet
moisture To attend more easily to Mother Bunch Adrienne had thrown
aside her bonnet and the silky waves of her beautiful golden hair
almost concealed her face as she bent over the mattress rubbing the
thin ivory hands of the poor sempstress completely called to life by
the salubrious freshness of the air and by the strong action of the
salts which Adrienne carried in her smellingbottle Luckily Mother
Bunch had fainted rather from emotion and weakness than from the
effects of suffocation the senses of the unfortunate girl having
failed her before the deleterious gas had attained its highest degree of
intensity

Before continuing the recital of the scene between the sempstress and
the patrician a few retrospective words will be necessary Since
the strange adventure at the theatre of the PorteSaintMartin where
Djalma at peril of his life rushed upon the black panther in sight of
Mdlle de Cardoville the young lady had been deeply affected in various
ways Forgetting her jealousy and the humiliation she had suffered in
presence of Djalmaof Djalma exhibiting himself before every one with a
woman so little worthy of himAdrienne was for a moment dazzled by the
chivalrous and heroic action of the prince and said to herself In
spite of odious appearances Djalma loves me enough to brave death in
order to pick up my nosegay

But with a soul so delicate as that of this young lady a character so
generous and a mind so true reflection was certain soon to demonstrate
the vanity of such consolations powerless to cure the cruel wounds of
offended dignity an love

How many times said Adrienne to herself and with reason has the
prince encountered in hunting from pure caprice and with no gain such
danger as he braved in picking up my bouquet and then who tells me he
did not mean to offer it to the woman who accompanied him

Singular it may be in the eyes of the world but just and great in
those of heaven the ideas which Adrienne cherished with regard to love
joined to her natural pride presented an invincible obstacle to the
thought of her succeeding this woman whoever she might be thus
publicly displayed by the prince as his mistress And yet Adrienne
hardly dared avow to herself that she experienced a feeling of
jealousy only the more painful and humiliating the less her rival
appeared worthy to be compared to her

At other times on the contrary in spite of a conscious sense of her
own value Mdlle de Cardoville remembering the charming countenance of
RosePompon asked herself if the bad taste and improper manners of this
pretty creature resulted from precocious and depraved effrontery or
from a complete ignorance of the usages of society In the latter case
such ignorance arising from a simple and ingenuous nature might in
itself have a great charm and if to this attraction combined with that
of incontestable beauty were added sincere love and a pure soul the
obscure birth or neglected education of the girl might be of little
consequence and she might be capable of inspiring Djalma with a
profound passion If Adrienne hesitated to see a lost creature in
RosePompon notwithstanding unfavorable appearances it was because
remembering what so many travellers had related of Djalmas greatness of
soul and recalling the conversation she had overheard between him
and Rodin she could not bring herself to believe that a man of
such remarkable intelligence with so tender a heart so poetical
imaginative and enthusiastic a mind could be capable of loving a
depraved and vulgar creature and of openly exhibiting himself in public
along with her There was a mystery in the transaction which Adrienne
sought in vain to penetrate These trying doubts this cruel curiosity
only served to nourish Adriennes fatal love and we may imagine her
incurable despair when she found that the indifference or even disdain
of Djalma was unable to stifle a passion that now burned more fiercely
than ever Sometimes having recourse to notions of fatality she
fancied that she was destined to feel this love that Djalma must
therefore deserve it and that one day whatever was incomprehensible in
the conduct of the prince would be explained to his advantage At other
times on the contrary she felt ashamed of excusing Djalma and the
consciousness of this weakness was for Adrienne a constant occasion
for remorse and torture The victim of all these agonies she lived in
perfect solitude

The cholera soon broke out startling as a clap of thunder Too unhappy
to fear the pestilence on her own account Adrienne was only moved by
the sorrows of others She was amongst the first to contribute to those
charitable donations which were now flowing in from all sides in the
admirable spirit of benevolence Florine was suddenly attacked by the
epidemic In spite of the danger her mistress insisted on seeing her
and endeavored to revive her failing courage Conquered by this new mark
of kindness Florine could no longer conceal the treachery in which she
had borne a part Death was about to deliver her from the odious tyranny
of the people whose yoke weighed upon her and she was at length in a
position to reveal everything to Adrienne The latter thus learned how
she had been continually betrayed by Florine and also the cause of the
sewinggirls abrupt departure At these revelations Adrienne felt her
affection and tender pity for the poor sempstress greatly increase By
her command the most active steps were taken to discover traces of the
hunchback but Florines confession had a still more important result
Justly alarmed at this new evidence of Rodins machinations Adrienne
remembered the projects formed when believing herself beloved the
instinct of affection had revealed to her the perils to which Djalma and
other members of the Rennepont family were exposed To assemble the
race around her and bid them rally against the common enemy such was
Adriennes first thought when she heard the confession of Florine She
regarded it as a duty to accomplish this project In a struggle with
such dangerous and powerful adversaries as Rodin Father dAigrigny and
the Princess de SaintDizier and their allies Adrienne saw not only
the praiseworthy and perilous task of unmasking hypocrisy and cupidity
but also if not a consolation at least a generous diversion in the
midst of terrible sorrows

From this moment a restless feverish activity took the place of the
mournful apathy in which the young lady had languished She called round
her all the members of her family capable of answering the appeal and
as had been mentioned in the secret note delivered to Father dAigrigny
Cardoville House soon became the centre of the most active and unceasing
operations and also a place of meeting in which the modes of attack
and defence were fully discussed Perfectly correct in all points the
secret note of which we have spoken stated as a mere conjecture that
Mdlle de Cardoville had granted an interview to Djalma This fact was
untrue but the cause which led to the supposition will be explained
hereafter Far from such being the case Mdlle de Cardoville scarcely
found in attending to the great family interests now at stake a
momentary diversion from the fatal love which was slowly undermining
her health and with which she so bitterly reproached herself

The morning of the day on which Adrienne at length discovering Mother
Bunchs residence came so miraculously to rescue her from death
Agricola Baudoin had been to Cardoville House to confer on the subject
of Francis Hardy and had begged Adrienne to permit him to accompany her
to the Rue Clovis whither they repaired in haste

Thus once again there was a noble spectacle a touching symbol Mdlle
de Cardoville and Mother Bunch the two extremities of the social chain
were united on equal termsfor the sempstress and the fair patrician
were equal in intelligence and heartand equal also because the one
was the ideal of riches grace and beauty and the other the ideal
of resignation and unmerited misfortuneand does not a halo rest on
misfortune borne with courage and dignity Stretched on her mattress
the hunchback appeared so weak that even if Agricola had not been
detained on the ground floor with Cephyse now dying a dreadful death
Mdlle de Cardoville would have waited some time before inducing Mother
Bunch to rise and accompany her to her carriage Thanks to the presence
of mind and pious fraud of Adrienne the sewinggirl was persuaded
that Cephyse had been carried to a neighboring hospital to receive
the necessary succors which promised to be crowned with success The
hunchbacks faculties recovering slowly from their stupor she at first
received this fable without the least suspicionfor she did not even
know that Agricola had accompanied Mdlle de Cardoville

And it is to you lady that Cephyse and I owe our lives said she
turning her mild and melancholy face towards Adrienne you kneeling in
this garret near this couch of misery where I and my sister meant to
diefor you assure me lady that Cephyse was succored in time

Be satisfied I was told just now that she was recovering her senses

And they told her I was living did they not lady Otherwise she
would perhaps regret having survived me

Be quite easy my dear girl said Adrienne pressing the poor hands in
her own and gazing on her with eyes full of tears they have told her
all that was proper Do not trouble yourself about anything only think
of recoveringand I hope you will yet enjoy that happiness of which you
have known so little my poor child

How kind you are lady After flying from your houseand when you must
think me so ungrateful

Presently when you are not so weak I have a great deal to tell you
Just now it would fatigue you too much But how do you feel

Better lady This fresh airand then the thought that since you are
comemy poor sister will no more be reduced to despair for I will
tell you all and I am sure you will have pity on Cephysewill you not
lady

Rely upon me my child answered Adrienne forced to dissemble her
painful embarrassment you know I am interested in all that interests
you But tell me added Mdlle de Cardoville in a voice of emotion
before taking this desperate resolution did you not write to me

Yes lady

Alas resumed Adrienne sorrowfully and when you received no
answerhow cruel how ungrateful you must have thought me

Oh never lady did I accuse you of such feelings my poor sister will
tell you so You had my gratitude to the last

I believe youfor I knew your heart But how then did you explain my
silence

I had justly offended you by my sudden departure lady

OffendedAlas I never received your letter

And yet you know that I wrote to you lady

Yes my poor girl I know also that you wrote to me at my porters
lodge Unfortunately he delivered your letter to one of my women named
Florine telling her it came from you

Florine the young woman that was so kind to me

Florine deceived me shamefully she was sold to my enemies and acted
as a spy on my actions

SheGood Heavens cried Mother Bunch Is it possible

She herself answered Adrienne bitterly but after all we
must pity as well as blame her She was forced to obey by a terrible
necessity and her confession and repentance secured my pardon before
her death

Then she is deadso young so fair

In spite of her faults I was greatly moved by her end She confessed
what she had done with such heartrending regrets Amongst her avowals
she told me she had intercepted a letter in which you asked for an
interview that might save your sisters life

It is true lady such were the terms of my letter What interest had
they to keep it from you

They feared to see you return to me my good guardian angel You loved
me so tenderly and my enemies dreaded your faithful affection so
wonderfully aided by the admirable instinct of your heart Ah I shall
never forget how welldeserved was the horror with which you were
inspired by a wretch whom I defended against your suspicions

M Rodin said Mother Bunch with a shudder

Yes replied Adrienne but we will not talk of these people now
Their odious remembrance would spoil the joy I feel in seeing you
restored to lifefor your voice is less feeble your cheeks are
beginning to regain a little color Thank God I am so happy to have
found you once moreif you knew all that I hope all that I expect
from our reunionfor we will not part againpromise me that in the
name of our friendship

Iyour friend said Mother Bunch timidly casting down her eyes

A few days before your departure from my house did I not call you
my friend my sister What is there changed Nothing nothing
added Mdlle de Cardoville with deep emotion One might say on
the contrary that a fatal resemblance in our positions renders your
friendship even dearer to me And I shall have it shall I not Oh do
not refuse it meI am so much in want of a friend

You lady you in want of the friendship of a poor creature like me

Yes answered Adrienne as she gazed on the other with an expression
of intense grief nay more you are perhaps the only person to whom
I could venture to confide my bitter sorrows So saying Mdlle de
Cardoville colored deeply

And how do I deserve such marks of confidence asked Mother Bunch
more and more surprised

You deserve it by the delicacy of your heart by the steadiness of your
character answered Adrienne with some hesitation thenyou are a
womanand I am certain you will understand what I suffer and pity me

Pity you lady said the other whose astonishment continued to
increase You a great lady and so much enviedI so humble and
despised pity you

Tell me my poor friend resumed Adrienne after some moments of
silence are not the worst griefs those which we dare not avow to
any one for fear of raillery and contempt How can we venture to ask
interest or pity for sufferings that we hardly dare avow to ourselves
because they make us blush

The sewinggirl could hardly believe what she heard Had her
benefactress felt like her the effects of an unfortunate passion she
could not have held any other language But the sempstress could not
admit such a supposition so attributing to some other cause the
sorrows of Adrienne she answered mournfully whilst she thought of her
own fatal love for Agricola Oh yes lady A secret grief of which we
are ashamed must be frightfulvery frightful

But then what happiness to meet not only a heart noble enough to
inspire complete confidence but one which has itself been tried by
a thousand sorrows and is capable of affording you pity support and
counselTell me my dear child added Mdlle de Cardoville as she
looked attentively at Mother Bunch if you were weighed down by one of
those sorrows at which one blushes would you not be happy very happy
to find a kindred soul to whom you might entrust your griefs and half
relieve them by entire and merited confidence

For the first time in her life Mother Bunch regarded Mdlle de
Cardoville with a feeling of suspicion and sadness

The last words of the young lady seemed to her full of meaning
Doubtless she knows my secret said Mother Bunch to herself
doubtless my journal has fallen into her handsShe knows my love
for Agricola or at least suspects it What she has been saying to me is
intended to provoke my confidence and to assure herself if she has been
rightly informed

These thoughts excited in the workgirls mind no bitter or ungrateful
feeling towards her benefactress but the heart of the unfortunate girl
was so delicately susceptible on the subject of her fatal passion that
in spite of her deep and tender affection for Mdlle de Cardoville
she suffered cruelly at the thought of Adriennes being mistress of her
secret




CHAPTER XXXIV MORE CONFESSIONS

The fancy at first so painful that Mdlle de Cardoville was informed
of her love for Agricola was soon exchanged in the hunchbacks heart
thanks to the generous instincts of that rare and excellent creature
for a touching regret which showed all her attachment and veneration
for Adrienne

Perhaps said Mother Bunch to herself conquered by the influence
of the adorable kindness of my protectress I might have made to her a
confession which I could make to none other and revealed a secret which
I thought to carry with me to my grave It would at least have been a
mark of gratitude to Mdlle de Cardoville but unfortunately I am
now deprived of the sad comfort of confiding my only secret to my
benefactress And thenhowever generous may be her pity for me however
intelligent her affection she cannotshe that is so fair and so
much admiredshe cannot understand how frightful is the position of a
creature like myself hiding in the depth of a wounded heart a love at
once hopeless and ridiculous No noin spite of the delicacy of her
attachment my benefactress must unconsciously hurt my feelings even
whilst she pities mefor only sympathetic sorrows can console each
other Alas why did she not leave me to die

These reflections presented themselves to the thinkers mind as rapidly
as thought could travel Adrienne observed her attentively she remarked
that the sewinggirls countenance which had lately brightened up was
again clouded and expressed a feeling of painful humiliation Terrified
at this relapse into gloomy dejection the consequences of which might
be serious for Mother Bunch was still very weak and as it were
hovering on the brink of the grave Mdlle de Cardoville resumed
hastily My friend do not you think with me that the most cruel and
humiliating grief admits of consolation when it can be entrusted to a
faithful and devoted heart

Yes lady said the young sempstress bitterly but the heart which
suffers in silence should be the only judge of the moment for making
so painful a confession Until then it would perhaps be more humane to
respect its fatal secret even if one had by chance discovered it

You are right my child said Adrienne sorrowfully if I choose this
solemn moment to entrust you with a very painful secret it is that
when you have heard me I am sure you will set more value on your life
as knowing how much I need your tenderness consolation and pity

At these words the other half raised herself on the mattress and
looked at Mdlle de Cardoville in amazement She could scarcely believe
what she heard far from designing to intrude upon her confidence it
was her protectress who was to make the painful confession and who came
to implore pity and consolation from her

What stammered she you lady

I come to tell you that I suffer and am ashamed of my sufferings
Yes added the young lady with a touching expression yesof all
confessions I am about to make the most painfulI loveand I blush
for my love

Like myself cried Mother Bunch involuntarily clasping her hands
together

I love resumed Adrienne with a longpentup grief I love and am
not belovedand my love is miserable is impossibleit consumes meit
kills meand I dare not confide to any one the fatal secret

Like me repeated the other with a fixed look Shea queen in
beauty rank wealth intelligencesuffers like me Like me poor
unfortunate creature she loves and is not loved again

Well yes like you I love and am not loved again cried Mdlle de
Cardoville was I wrong in saying that to you alone I could confide
my secretbecause having suffered the same pangs you alone can pity
them

Then lady said Mother Bunch casting down her eyes and recovering
from her first amazement you knew

I knew all my poor childbut never should I have mentioned your
secret had I not had one to entrust you with of a still more painful
nature Yours is cruel but mine is humiliating Oh my sister added
Mdlle de Cardoville in a tone impossible to describe misfortune
you see blends and confounds together what are called distinctions of
rank and fortuneand often those whom the world envies are reduced by
suffering far below the poorest and most humble and have to seek from
the latter pity and consolation

Then drying her tears which nosy flowed abundantly Mdlle de
Cardoville resumed in a voice of emotion Come sister courage
courage let us love and sustain each other Let this sad and mysterious
bond unite us forever

Oh lady forgive me But now that you know the secret of my life
said the workgirl casting down her eyes and unable to vanquish
her confusion it seems to me that I can never look at you without
blushing

And why because you love Agricola said Adrienne Then I must die
of shame before you since less courageous than you I had not the
strength to suffer and be resigned and so conceal my love in the depths
of my heart He that I love with a love henceforth deprived of hope
knew of that love and despised itpreferring to me a woman the very
choice of whom was a new and grievous insult if I am not much deceived
by appearances I sometimes hope that I am deceived on this point Now
tell meis it for you to blush

Alas lady who could tell you all this

Which you only entrusted to your journal Well thenit was the dying
Florine who confessed her misdeeds She had been base enough to steal
your papers forced to this odious act by the people who had dominion
over her But she had read your journaland as every good feeling was
not dead within her your admirable resignation your melancholy and
pious love had left such an impression on her mind that she was able
to repeat whole passages to me on her death bed and thus to explain the
cause of your sudden disappearancefor she had no doubt that the fear
of seeing your love for Agricola divulged had been the cause of your
flight

Alas it is but too true lady

Oh yes answered Adrienne bitterly those who employed the wretched
girl to act as she did well knew the effect of the blow It was not
their first attempt They reduced you to despair they would have killed
you because you were devoted to me and because you had guessed their
intentions Oh these blackgowns are implacable and their power is
great said Adrienne shuddering

It is fearful lady

But do not be alarmed dear child you see that the arms of the wicked
have turned against themselves for the moment I knew the cause of your
flight you became dearer to me than ever From that time I made every
exertion to find out where you were after long efforts it was only
this morning that the person I had employed succeeded in discovering
that you inhabited this house Agricola was with me when I heard it and
instantly asked to accompany me

Agricola said Mother Bunch clasping her hands he came

Yes my childbe calm Whilst I attended to you he was busy with your
poor sister You will soon see him

Alas lady resumed the hunchback in alarm He doubtless knows

Your love No no be satisfied Only think of the happiness of again
seeing your good and worthy brother

Ah lady may he never know what caused me so much shame that I was
like to die of it Thank God he is not aware of it

Then let us have no more sad thoughts my child Only remember that
this worthy brother came here in time to save us from everlasting
regretsand you from a great fault Oh I do not speak of the
prejudices of the world with regard to the right of every creature to
return to heaven a life that has become too burdensomeI only say that
you ought not to have died because those who love you and whom you
love were still in need of your assistance

I thought you happy Agricola was married to the girl of his choice
who will I am sure make him happy To whom could I be useful

First to myself as you seeand then who tells you that Agricola
will never have need of you Who tells you that his happiness or that
of his family will last forever and will not be tried by cruel shocks
And even if those you love had been destined to be always happy could
their happiness be complete without you And would not your death with
which they would perhaps have reproached themselves have left behind it
endless regrets

It is true lady answered the other I was wrongthe dizziness of
despair had seized mefrightful misery weighed upon uswe had not
been able to find work for some dayswe lived on the charity of a poor
woman and her the cholera carried off Tomorrow or next day we must
have died of hunger

Die of hungerand you knew where I lived

I had written to you lady and receiving no answer I thought you
offended at my abrupt departure

Poor dear child you must have been as you say seized with dizziness
in that terrible moment so that I have not the courage to reproach you
for doubting me a single instant How can I blame you Did I not myself
think of terminating my life

You lady cried the hunchback

Yes I thought of itwhen they came to tell me that Florine dying
wished to speak to me I heard what she had to say her revelations
changed my projects This dark and mournful life which had become
insupportable to me was suddenly lighted up The sense of duty woke
within me You were no doubt a prey to horrible misery it was my duty
to seek and save you Florines confessions unveiled to me the new plots
of the enemies of my scattered family dispersed by sorrows and cruel
losses it was my duty to warn them of their danger and to unite them
against the common enemy I had been the victim of odious manoeuvres
it was my duty to punish their authors for fear that encouraged by
impunity these blackgowns should make other victims Then the sense of
duty gave me strength and I was able to rouse myself from my lethargy
With the help of Abbe Gabriel a sublime oh a sublime priestthe
ideal of a true Christianthe worthy brother of AgricolaI
courageously entered on the struggle What shall I say to you my child
The performance of these duties the hope of finding you again have
been some relief to me in my trouble If I was not consoled I was at
least occupied Your tender friendship the example of your resignation
will do the restI think soI am sure soand I shall forget this
fatal love

At the moment Adrienne pronounced these words rapid footsteps were
heard upon the stairs and a young clear voice exclaimed Oh dear me
poor Mother Bunch How lucky I have come just now If only I could be of
some use to her

Almost immediately RosePompon entered the garret with precipitation
Agricola soon followed the grisette and pointing to the open window
tried to make Adrienne understand by signs that she was not to mention
to the girl the deplorable end of the Bacchanal Queen This pantomime
was lost on Mdlle de Cardoville Adriennes heart swelled with grief
indignation pride as she recognized the girl she had seen at the Porte
SaintMartin in company with Djalma and who alone was the cause of the
dreadful sufferings she endured since that fatal evening And strange
irony of fate it was at the very moment when Adrienne had just made the
humiliating and cruel confession of her despised love that the woman
to whom she believed herself sacrificed appeared before her

If the surprise of Mdlle de Cardoville was great RosePompons was not
less so Not only did she recognize in Adrienne the fair young lady with
the golden locks who had sat opposite to her at the theatre on the
night of the adventure of the black panther but she had serious reasons
for desiring most ardently this unexpected interview It is impossible
to paint the look of malignant joy and triumph that she affected to
cast upon Adrienne The first impulse of Mdlle de Cardoville was to
quit the room But she could not bear to leave Mother Bunch at this
moment or to give in the presence of Agricola her reasons for such an
abrupt departure and moreover an inexplicable and fatal curiosity held
her back in spite of her offended pride She remained therefore and
was about to examine closely to hear and to judge this rival who
had nearly occasioned her death to whom in her jealous agony she had
ascribed so many different aspects in order to explain Djalmas love
for such a creature




CHAPTER XXXV THE RIVALS

RosePompon whose presence caused such deep emotion in Mdlle de
Cardoville was dressed in the most showy and extravagant bad taste Her
very small narrow rosecolored satin bonnet placed so forward over
her face as almost to touch the tip of her little nose left uncovered
behind half of her light silky hair her plaid dress of an excessively
broad pattern was open in front and the almost transparent gauze
rather too honest in its revelations hardly covered the charms of the
form beneath

The grisette having run all the way upstairs held in her hands the ends
of her large blue shawl which falling from her shoulders had slid
down to her wasplike waist and there been stopped by the swell of the
figure If we enter into these details it is to explain how at the
sight of this pretty creature dressed in so impertinent and almost
indecent a fashion Mdlle de Cardoville who thought she saw in her a
successful rival felt her indignation grief and shame redoubled

But judge of the surprise and confusion of Adrienne when Mdlle
Rose Pompon said to her with the utmost freedom and pertness I am
delighted to see you madame You and I must have a long talk together
Only I must begin by kissing poor Mother Bunchwith your permission
madame

To understand the tone and manner with which this word madame was
pronounced you must have been present at some stormy discussion between
two RosePompons jealous of each other then you would be able to judge
how much provoking hostility may be compressed into the word madame
under certain circumstances Amazed at the impudence of RosePompon
Mdlle de Cardoville remained mute whilst Agricola entirely occupied
with the interest he took in the workgirl who had never withdrawn her
eyes from him since he entered the room and with the remembrance of
the painful scene he had just quitted whispered to Adrienne without
remarking the grisettes effrontery Alas lady it is all over
Cephyse has just breathed her last sigh without recovering her senses

Unfortunate girl said Adrienne with emotion and for the moment she
forgot RosePompon

We must keep this sad news from Mother Bunch and only let her know it
hereafter with great caution resumed Agricola Luckily little Rose
Pompon knows nothing about it

And he pointed to the grisette who was now stooping down by the side
of the workgirl On hearing Agricola speak so familiarly of RosePompon
Adriennes amazement increased It is impossible to describe what she
felt yet strangely enough her sufferings grew less and less and her
anxiety diminished as she listened to the chatter of the grisette

Oh my good dear said the latter with as much volubility as emotion
while her pretty blue eyes were filled with tears is it possible that
you did so stupid a thing Do not poor people help one another Could
you not apply to me You knew that others are welcome to whatever is
mine and I would have made a raffle of Philemons bazaar added this
singular girl with a burst of feeling at once sincere touching and
grotesque I would have sold his three boots pipes boatingcostume
bed and even his great drinkingglass and at all events you should not
have been brought to such an ugly pass Philemon would not have minded
for he is a good fellow and if he had minded it would have been all
the same Thank heaven we are not married I am only wishing to remind
you that you should have thought of little RosePompon

I know you are obliging and kind miss said Mother Bunch for she had
heard from her sister that RosePompon like so many of her class had a
warm and generous heart

After all resumed the grisette wiping with the back of her hand the
tip of her little nose down which a tear was trickling you may tell
me that you did not know where I had taken up my quarters Its a queer
story I can tell you When I say queer added RosePompon with a deep
sigh it is quite the contrarybut no matter I need not trouble you
with that One thing is certain you are getting betterand you and
Cephyse will not do such a thing again She is said to be very weak Can
I not see her yet M Agricola

No said the smith with embarrassment for Mother Bunch kept her eyes
fixed upon him you must have patience

But I may see her today Agricola exclaimed the hunchback

We will talk about that Only be calm I entreat

Agricola is right you must be reasonable my good dear resumed Rose
Pompon we will wait patiently I can wait too for I have to talk
presently to this lady and RosePompon glanced at Adrienne with the
expression of an angry cat Yes yes I can wait for I long to tell
Cephyse also that she may reckon upon me Here RosePompon bridled up
very prettily and thus continued Do not be uneasy It is the least
one can do when one is in a good position to share the advantages with
ones friends who are not so well off It would be a fine thing to keep
ones happiness to ones self to stuff it with straw and put it under
a glass and let no one touch it When I talk of happiness its only
to make talk it is true in one sense but to another you see my good
dearBah I am only seventeenbut no matterI might go on talking
till tomorrow and you would not be any the wiser So let me kiss you
once more and dont be downheartednor Cephyse either do you hear
for I shall be close at hand

And stooping still lower RosePompon cordially embraced Mother Bunch
It is impossible to express what Mdlle de Cardoville felt during this
conversation or rather during this monologue of the grisette on the
subject of the attempted suicide The eccentric jargon of Mdlle Rose
Pompon her liberal facility in disposing of Philemons bazaar to the
owner of which as she said she was luckily not marriedthe goodness
of her heart which revealed itself in her offers of serviceher
contrasts her impertinence her drolleryall this was so new and
inexplicable to Mdlle de Cardoville that she remained for some time
mute and motionless with surprise Such then was the creature to whom
Djalma had sacrificed her

If Adriennes first impression at sight of RosePompon had been horribly
painful reflection soon awakened doubts which were to become shortly
ineffable hopes Remembering the interview she had overheard between
Rodin and Djalma when concealed in the conservatory she had wished
to prove the Jesuits fidelity Adrienne asked herself if it was
reasonable if it was possible to believe that the prince whose ideas
of love seemed to be so poetical so elevated so pure could find any
charm in the disjointed and silly chat of this young girl Adrienne
could not hesitate she pronounced the thing impossible from the moment
she had seen her rival near and witnessed her style both of manners
and conversation which without detracting from the prettiness of
her features gave them a trivial and not very attractive character
Adriennes doubts with regard to the deep love of the prince for Rose
Pompon were hence soon changed to complete incredulity Endowed with
too much sense and penetration not to perceive that this apparent
connection so inconceivable on the part of Djalma must conceal some
mystery Mdlle de Cardoville felt her hopes revive As this consoling
thought arose in her mind her heart until now so painfully oppressed
began once more to dilate she felt vague aspirations towards a better
future and yet cruelly warned by the past she feared to yield too
readily to a mere illusion for she remembered the notorious fact that
the prince had really appeared in public with this girl But now that
Mdlle de Cardoville could fully appreciate what she was she found the
conduct of the prince only the more incomprehensible And how can we
judge soundly and surely of that which is enveloped in mystery And then
a secret presentiment told her that it would perhaps be beside the
couch of the poor sempstress whom she had just saved from death that
by a providential coincidence she would learn the secret on which
depended the happiness of her life

The emotions which agitated she heart of Adrienne became so violent
that her fine face was flushed with a bright red her bosom heaved and
her large black eyes lately dimmed by sadness once more shone with a
mild radiance She waited with inexpressible impatience for what was to
follow In the interview with which RosePompon had threatened her
and which a few minutes before Adrienne would have declined with all the
dignity of legitimate indignation she now hoped to find the explanation
of a mystery which it was of such importance for her to clear up After
once more tenderly embracing Mother Bunch RosePompon got up from the
ground and turning towards Adrienne eyed her from head to foot with
the utmost coolness and said to her in a somewhat impertinent tone
It is now our turn madamethe word madame still pronounced
with the accent before describedwe have a little matter to settle
together

I am at your order answered Adrienne with much mildness and
simplicity

At sight of the triumphant and decisive air of RosePompon and on
hearing her challenge to Mdlle de Cardoville the worthy Agricola
after exchanging a few words with Mother Bunch opened his eyes and ears
very wide and remained staring in amazement at the effrontery of the
grisette then advancing towards her he whispered as he plucked her
by the sleeve I say are you mad Do you know to whom you speak

Well what then Is not one pretty woman worth another I say that for
the lady She will not eat me I suppose replied RosePompon aloud
and with an air of defiance I have to talk with madame here I am
sure she knows why and wherefore If not I will tell her it will not
take me long

Adrienne who feared some ridiculous exposure on the subject of Djalma
in the presence of Agricola made a sign to the latter and thus
answered the grisette I am ready to hear you miss but not in this
place You will understand why

Very well madame I have my key You can come to any apartmentsthe
last word pronounced with an air of ostentatious importance

Let us go then to your apartments miss since you to me the honor to
receive me there answered Mdlle de Cardoville in her mild sweet
voice and with a slight inclination of the head so full of exquisite
politeness that RosePompon was daunted notwithstanding all her
effrontery

What lady said Agricola to Adrienne you are good enough

M Agricola said Mdlle de Cardoville interrupting him please to
remain with our poor friend I shall soon be back

Then approaching Mother Bunch who shared in Agricolas astonishment
she said to her Excuse me for leaving you a few seconds Only regain a
little strength and when I return I will take you home with me dear
sister

Then turning towards RosePompon who was more and more surprised at
hearing so fine a lady call the workgirl her sister she added I am
ready whenever you please mademoiselle

Beg pardon madame if I go first to show you the way but its a
regular breakneck sort of a place answered RosePompon pressing her
elbows to her sides and screwing up her lips to prove that she was no
stranger to polite manners and fine language And the two rivals quitted
the garret together leaving Agricola alone with Mother Bunch

Luckily the disfigured remains of the Bacchanal Queen had been
carried into Mother Arsenes subterraneous shop so that the crowd of
spectators always attracted by any fatal event had assembled in front
of the house and RosePompon meeting no one in the little court she
had to traverse with Adrienne continued in ignorance of the tragical
death of her old friend Cephyse In a few moments the grisette and
Mdlle de Cardoville had reached Philemons apartment This singular
abode remained in the same state of picturesque disorder in which
RosePompon had left it when Ninny Moulin came to fetch her to act the
heroine of a mysterious adventure

Adrienne completely ignorant of the eccentric modes of life of students
and their companions could not in spite of the thoughts which occupied
her mind forebear examining with a mixture of surprise and curiosity
this strange and grotesque chaos composed of the most dissimilar
objectsdisguises for masked balls skulls with pipes in their mouths
odd boots standing on book shelves monstrous bottles womens clothes
ends of tobacco pipes etc etc To the first astonishment of Adrienne
succeeded an impression of painful repugnance The young lady felt
herself uneasy and out of place in this abode not of poverty but
disorder whilst on the contrary the sewinggirls miserable garret
had caused her no such feeling

RosePompon notwithstanding all her airs was considerably troubled
when she found herself alone with Mdlle de Cardoville the rare beauty
of the young patrician her fashionable look the elegance of her
manners the style both dignified and affable with which she had
answered the impertinent address of the grisette began to have their
effect upon the latter who being moreover a goodnatured girl had
been touched at hearing Mdlle de Cardoville call the hunchback friend
and sister Without knowing exactly who Adrienne was RosePompon
was not ignorant that she belonged to the richest and highest class
of society she felt already some remorse at having attacked her so
cavalierly and her intentions at first very hostile with regard to
Mdlle de Cardoville were gradually much modified Yet being very
obstinate and not wishing to appear to submit to an influence that
offended her pride RosePompon endeavored to recover her assurance
and having bolted the door she said to Adrienne Pray do me the favor
to sit down madamestill with the intention of showing that she was
no stranger to refined manners and conversation

Mdlle de Cardoville was about mechanically to take a chair when Rose
Pompon worthy to practise those ancient virtues of hospitality which
regarded even an enemy as sacred in the person of a guest cried out
hastily Dont take that chair madame it wants a leg

Adrienne laid her hand on another chair

Nor that either the back is quite loose again exclaimed RosePompon
And she spoke the truth for the chairback which was made in the form
of a lyre remained in the hands of Mdlle de Cardoville who said as
she replaced it discreetly in its former position I think miss that
we can very well talk standing

As you please madame replied RosePompon steadying herself the more
bravely the more uneasy she felt And the interview of the lady and the
grisette began in this fashion




CHAPTER XXXVI THE INTERVIEW

After a minutes hesitation RosePompon said to Adrienne whose heart
was beating violently I will tell you directly madame what I have
on my mind I should not have gone out of my way to seek you but as I
happen to fall in with you it is very natural I should take advantage
of it

But miss said Adrienne mildly may I at least know the subject of
the conversation we are to have together

Yes madame replied RosePompon affecting an air of still more
decided confidence first of all you must not suppose I am unhappy or
going to make a scene of jealousy or cry like a forsaken damsel Do not
flatter yourself Thank heaven I have no reason to complain of Prince
Charmingthat is the pet name I gave himon the contrary he has made
me very happy If I left him it was against his will and because I
chose

So saying RosePompon whose heart was swelling in spite of her fine
airs could not repress a sigh

Yes madame she resumed I left him because I chosefor he quite
doted on me If I had liked he would have married meyes madame
married meso much the worse if that gives you pain Though when I
say so much the worse it is true that I meant to pain you To be sure
I didbut then just now when I saw you so kind to poor Mother Bunch
though I was certainly in the right still I felt something However to
cut matters short it is clear that I detest you and that you deserve
it added RosePompon stamping her foot

From all this it resulted even for a person much less sagacious than
Adrienne and much less interested in discovering the truth that Rose
Pompon notwithstanding her triumphant airs in speaking of him whom she
represented as so much attached to her and even anxious to wed her
was in reality completely disappointed and was now taking refuge in a
deliberate falsehood It was evident that she was not loved and that
nothing but violent jealousy had induced her to desire this interview
with Mdlle de Cardoville in order to make what is vulgarly called a
scene considering Adrienne the reason will be explained presently as
her successful rival But RosePompon having recovered her goodnature
found it very difficult to continue the scene in question particularly
as for many reasons she felt overawed by Adrienne

Though she had expected if not the singular speech of the grisette at
least something of the same resultfor she felt it was impossible that
the prince could entertain a serious attachment for this girlMdlle de
Cardoville was at first delighted to hear the confirmation of her hopes
from the lips of her rival but suddenly these hopes were succeeded by a
cruel apprehension which we will endeavor to explain What Adrienne had
just heard ought to have satisfied her completely Sure that the heart
of Djalma had never ceased to belong to her she ought according to
the customs and opinions of the world to have cared little if in
the effervescence of an ardent youth he had chanced to yield to some
ephemeral caprice for this creature who was after all very pretty
and desirablethe more especially as he had now repaired his error by
separating from her

Notwithstanding these good reasons such an error of the senses would
not have been pardoned by Adrienne She did not understand that complete
separation of the body and soul that would make the one exempt from the
stains of the other She did not think it a matter of indifference
to toy with one woman whilst you were thinking of another Her young
chaste passionate love demanded an absolute fealtya fealty as just in
the eyes of heaven and nature as it may be ridiculous and foolish in the
eyes of man For the very reason that she cherished a refined religion
of the senses and revered them as an adorable and divine manifestation
Adrienne had all sorts of delicate scruples and nice repugnances
unknown to the austere spirituality of those ascetic prudes who despise
vile matter too much to take notice of its errors and allow it to
grovel in filth to show the contempt in which they hold it Mdlle de
Cardoville was not one of those wonderfully modest creatures who would
die of confusion rather than say plainly that they wished for a young
and handsome husband at once ardent and pure It is true that they
generally marry old ugly and corrupted men and make up for it
by taking two or three lovers six months after But Adrienne felt
instinctively how much of virginal and celestial freshness there is in
the equal innocence of two loving and passionate beingswhat guarantees
for the future in the remembrance which a man preserves of his first
love

We say then that Adrienne was only halfsatisfied though convinced by
the vexation of RosePompon that Djalma had never entertained a serious
attachment for the grisette

And why do you detest me miss said Adrienne mildly when RosePompon
had finished her speech

Oh bless me madame replied the latter forgetting altogether her
assumption of triumph and yielding to the natural sincerity of her
character pretend that you dont know why I detest youOh yes
people go and pick bouquets from the jaws of a panther for people that
they care nothing about dont they And if it was only that added
RosePompon who was gradually getting animated and whose pretty face
at first contracted into a sullen pout now assumed an expression of
real and yet halfcomic sorrow

And if it was only the nosegay resumed she Though it gave me a
dreadful turn to see Prince Charming leap like a kid upon the stage I
might have said to myself Pooh these Indians have their own way of
showing politeness Here a lady drops her nosegay and a gentleman
picks it up and gives it to her but in India it is quite another thing
the man picks up the nosegay and does not return it to the womanhe
only kills a panther before her eyes Those are good manners in that
country I suppose but what cannot be good manners anywhere is to treat
a woman as I have been treated And all thanks to you madame

These complaints of RosePompon at once bitter and laughable did
not at all agree with what she had previously stated as to Djalmas
passionate love for her but Adrienne took care not to point out this
contradiction and said to her mildly You must be mistaken miss
when you suppose that I had anything to do with your troubles But in
any case I regret sincerely that you should have been illtreated by
any one

If you think I have been beaten you are quite wrong exclaimed Rose
Pompon Ah well I am sure No it is not that But I am certain that
had it not been for you Prince Charming would have got to love me
a little I am worthy of the trouble after alland then there are
different sorts of loveI am not so very particularnot even so much
as that added RosePompon snapping her fingers

Ah she continued when Ninny Moulin came to fetch me and brought
me jewels and laces to persuade me to go with him he was quite right in
saying there was no harm in his offers

Ninny Moulin asked Mdlle de Cardoville becoming more and more
interested who is this Ninny Moulin miss

A religious writer answered RosePompon pouting the righthand man
of a lot of old sacristans whose money he takes on pretense of writing
about morality and religion A fine morality it is

At these wordsa religious writersacristans Adrienne instantly
divined some new plot of Rodin or Father dAigrigny of which she and
Djalma were to have been the victims She began vaguely to perceive the
real state of the case as she resumed But miss under what pretence
could this man take you away with him

He came to fetch me and said I need not fear for my virtue and was
only to make myself look pretty So I said to myself Philemons out of
town and its very dull here all alone This seems a droll affair
what can I risk by itAlas I didnt know what I risked added
Rose Pompon with a sigh Well Ninny Moulin takes me away in a fine
carriage We stop in the Place du PalaisRoyal A sullenlooking man
with a yellow face gets up in the room of Ninny Moulin and takes me to
the house of Prince Charming When I saw himla he was so handsome
so very handsome that I was quite dizzylike and he had such a kind
noble air that I said to myself Well there will be some credit if
I remain a good girl nowI did not know what a true word I was
speaking I have been goodoh worse than good

What miss do you regret having been so virtuous

Why you see I regret at least that I have not had the pleasure of
refusing But how can you refuse when nothing is askedwhen you are
not even thought worth one little loving word

But miss allow me to observe to you that the indifference of which
you complain does not see to have prevented your making a long stay in
the house in question

How should I know why the prince kept me there or took me out riding
with him or to the play Perhaps it is the fashion in his savage
country to have a pretty girl by your side and to pay no attention to
her at all

But why then did you remain miss

Why did I remain said RosePompon stamping her loot with vexation
I remained because without knowing how it happened I began to get
very fond of Prince Charming and what is queer enough I who am as gay
as a lark loved him because he was so sorrowful which shows that it
was a serious matter At last one day I could hold out no longer I
said Never mind I dont care for the consequences Philemon I am
sure is having his fun in the country That set my mind at ease So
one morning I dress myself in my best all very pretty look in my
glass and say Well that will dohe cant stand that and going to
his room I tell him all that passes through my head I laugh I cryat
last I tell him that I adore him What do you think he answers in his
mild voice and as cold as a piece of marble Why Poor childpoor
childpoor child added RosePompon with indignation neither more
nor less than if I had come to complain to him of the toothache But
the worst of it is that I am sure if he were not in love elsewhere he
would be all fire and gunpowder Only now he is so sad so dejected

Then pausing a moment RosePompon added No I will not tell
you that you would be too pleased But after another pause she
continued Well never mind I will tell you though and this
singular girl looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with a mixture of sympathy
and deference Why should I keep it from you I began by riding
the high horse and saying that the prince wished to marry me and I
finished by confessing that he almost turned me out Well its not my
fault when I try to fib I am sure to get confused So madame this is
the plain truthWhen I met you at poor Mother Bunchs I was at first
as angry as a little turkeycock but when I heard you that are such a
fine great lady speak so kindly to the poor girl and treat her as your
sister do what I would my anger began to go away Since we have
been here I have done my utmost to get it up again but I find it
impossible and the more I see the difference between us the more I
perceive that Prince Charming was right in thinking so much of you For
you must know madame that he is over head and ears in love with you
I dont say so merely because he killed the panther for you at the
PorteSaintMartin but if you knew all the tricks he played with your
bouquet and how he will sit up all night weeping in that room where he
saw you for the first timeand then your portrait that he has
drawn upon glass after the fashion of his country and so many other
thingsthe fact is that I who was fond of him and saw all this was
at first in a great rage but afterwards it was so touching that it
brought the tears into my eyes Yes madame just as it does now when
I merely think of the poor prince Oh madame added RosePompon her
eyes swimming in tears and with such an expression of sincere interest
that Adrienne was much moved by it oh madame you look so mild and
good that you will not make this poor prince miserable Pray love him a
little bit what can it matter to you

So saying RosePompon with a perfectly simple though too familiar
gesture took hold of Adriennes hand as if to enforce her request It
had required great selfcommand in Mdlle de Cardoville to repress the
rush of joy that was mounting from her heart to her lips to check the
torrent of questions which she burned to address to RosePompon and to
restrain the sweet tears of happiness that for some seconds had trembled
in her eyes and strangely enough when RosePompon took her hand
Adrienne instead of withdrawing it pressed the offered hand almost
affectionately and led her towards the window as if to examine her
sweet face more attentively

On entering the room the grisette had thrown her bonnet and shawl down
upon the bed so that Adrienne could admire the thick and silky masses
of light hair that crowned the fresh face of the charming girl with
its firm rosy cheeks its mouth as red as a cherry and its large blue
laughing eyes and thanks to the somewhat scanty dress of RosePompon
Adrienne could fully appreciate the various graces of her nymphlike
figure Strange as it may appear Adrienne was delighted at finding
the girl still prettier than she had at first imagined The stoical
indifference of Djalma to so attractive a creature was the best proof of
the sincerity of the passion by which he was actuated

Having taken the hand of Adrienne RosePompon was herself confused and
surprised at the kindness with which Mdlle de Cardoville permitted
this familiarity Emboldened by this indulgence and by the silence of
Adrienne who for some moments had been contemplating her with almost
grateful benevolence the grisette resumed Oh you will not refuse
madame You will take pity on this poor prince

We cannot tell how Adrienne would have answered this indiscreet question
of RosePompon for suddenly a loud wild shrill piercing sound
evidently intended to imitate the crowing of a cock was heard close to
the door of the room

Adrienne started in alarm but the countenance of Rose Pompon just now
so sad brightened up joyously at this signal and clapping her hands
she exclaimed It is Philemon

Whatwho said Adrienne hastily

My lover oh the monster he must have come upstairs on tiptoe to
take me by surprise with his crowing Just like him

A second cockadoodledoo still louder than the first was heard close
to the door What a stupid droll creature it is Always the same joke
and yet it always amuses me said RosePompon

And drying her tears with the back of her hand she began to laugh
like one bewitched at Philemons jest which though well known to her
always seemed new and agreeable

Do not open the door whispered Adrienne much embarrassed do not
answer I beg of you

Though the door is bolted the key is on the outside Philemon can see
that there is some one at home

No matterdo not let him in

But madame he lives here the room belongs to him

In fact Philemon probably growing tired of the little effect produced
by his two ornithological imitations turned the key in the lock and
finding himself unable to open the door said in a deep bass voice
What dearest puss have you shut yourself in Are you praying Saint
Flambard for the return of Philly short for Philemon

Adrienne not coshing to increase by prolonging it the awkwardness of
this ridiculous situation went straight to the door and opened it
to the great surprise of Philemon who recoiled two or three steps
Notwithstanding the annoyance of this incident Mdlle de Cardoville
could not help smiling at sight of RosePompons lover and of the
articles he carried in his hand or under his arm

Philemon was a tall fellow with dark hair and a very fresh color and
being just arrived from a journey he wore a white cap his thick black
beard flowed down on his skyblue waistcoat and a short olivecolored
velvet shootingcoat with extravagantly large plaid trousers completed
his costume As for the accessories which had provoked a smile from
Adrienne they consisted first of a portmanteau tucked under his arm
with the head and neck of a goose protruding from it secondly of a
cage held in his hand with an enormous white rabbit all alive within
it

Oh the darling white rabbit what pretty red eyes Such it must be
confessed was the first exclamation of RosePompon though Philemon
to whom it was not addressed had returned after a long absence but the
student far from being shocked at seeing himself thus sacrificed to his
longearned companion smiled complacently rejoicing at the success of
his attempt to please his mistress

All this passed very rapidly While RosePompon kneeling before the
cage was still occupied with her admiration of the rabbit Philemon
struck with the lofty air of Mdlle de Cardoville raised his hand to
his cap and bowed respectfully as he made way for her to pass Adrienne
returned his salutation with politeness full of grace and dignity and
lightly descending the stairs soon disappeared Dazzled by her beauty
as well as impressed with her noble and lofty bearing and curious
to know how in the world RosePompon had fallen in with such an
acquaintance Philemon said to her in his amorous jargon Dearest
puss tell her Philly who is that fine lady

One of my schoolfellows you great satyr said RosePompon still
playing with the rabbit

Then glancing at a box which Philemon deposited close to the cage and
the portmanteau she added Ill wager anything you have brought me
some more preserves

Philly has brought something better to his dear puss said the
student imprinting two vigorous kisses on the rosy cheeks of
RosePompon who had at length consented to stand up Philly has
brought her his heart

Fudge said the grisette delicately placing the thumb of her left
hand on the tip of her nose and opening the fingers which she slightly
moved to and fro Philemon answered this provocation by putting his arm
around her waist and then the happy pair shut their door




CHAPTER XXXVII SOOTHING WORDS

During the interview of Adrienne with RosePompon a touching scene took
place between Agricola and Mother Bunch who had been much surprised
at Mdlle de Cardovilles condescension with regard to the grisette
Immediately after the departure of Adrienne Agricola had knelt down
beside Mother Bunch and said to her with profound emotion We are
alone and I can at length tell you what weighs upon my heart This act
is too cruelto die of misery and despair and not to send to me for
assistance

Listen to me Agricola

No there is no excuse for this What we called each other by the
names of brother and sister and for fifteen years gave every proof of
sincere affectionand when the day of misfortune comes you quit life
without caring for those you must leave behindwithout considering that
to kill yourself is to tell them they are indifferent to you

Forgive me Agricola it is true I had never thought of that said
the workgirl casting down her eyes but povertywant of work

Misery want of work and was I not here

And despair

But why despair This generous young lady had received you in her
house she knew your worth and treated you as her friendand just at
the moment when you had every chance of happiness you leave the house
abruptly and we remain in the most horrible anxiety on your account

I fearedto beto be a burden to my benefactress stammered she

You a burden to Mdlle de Cardoville that is so rich and good

I feared to be indiscreet said the sewinggirl more and more
embarrassed

Instead of answering his adopted sister Agricola remained silent and
contemplated her for some moments with an undefinable expression then
he exclaimed suddenly as if replying to a question put by himself She
will forgive me for disobeying herI am sure of it

He next turned towards Mother Bunch who was looking at him in
astonishment and said to her in a voice of emotion I am too frank
to keep up this deception I am reproaching youblaming youand my
thoughts are quite different

How so Agricola

My heart aches when I think of the evil I have done you

I do not understand you my friend you have never done me any evil

What never even in little things when for instance yielding to a
detestable habit I who loved and respected you as my sister insulted
you a hundred times a day

Insulted me

Yeswhen I gave you an odious and ridiculous nickname instead of
calling you properly

At these words Mother Bunch looked at the smith in the utmost alarm
trembling lest he had discovered her painful secret notwithstanding
the assurance she had received from Mdlle de Cardoville Yet she calmed
herself a little when she reflected that Agricola might of himself have
thought of the humiliation inflicted on her by calling her Mother Bunch
and she answered him with a forced smile Can you be grieved at so
small a thing It was a habit Agricola from childhood When did your
good and affectionate mother who nevertheless loved me as her daughter
ever call me anything else

And did my mother consult you about my marriage speak to you of the
rare beauty of my bride beg you to come and see her and study her
character in the hope that the instinct of your affection for me would
warn youif I made a bad choice Did my mother have this crueltyNo
it was I who thus pierced your heart

The fears of the hearer were again aroused there could be but little
doubt that Agricola knew her secret She felt herself sinking with
confusion yet making a last effort not to believe the discovery she
murmured in a feeble voice True Agricola It was not your mother but
yourself who made me that requestand I was grateful to you for such a
mark of confidence

Grateful my poor girl cried the smith whilst his eyes filled
with tears no it is not true I pained you fearfullyI was
mercilessheaven knows without being aware of it

But said the other in a voice now almost unintelligible what makes
you think so

Your love for me cried the smith trembling with emotion as he
clasped Mother Bunch in a brotherly embrace

Oh heaven murmured the unfortunate creature as she covered her face
with her hands he knows all

Yes I know all resumed Agricola with an expression of ineffable
tenderness and respect yes I know all and I will not have you blush
for a sentiment which honors me and of which I feel so justly proud
Yes I know all and I say to myself with joy and pride that the best
the most noble heart in the world is minewill be mine always Come
Magdalen let us leave shame to evil passions Raise your eyes and look
at me You know if my countenance was ever falseif it ever reflected
a feigned emotion Then look and tell me if you cannot read in my
features how proud I am Magdalen how justly proud of your love

Overwhelmed with grief and confusion Mother Bunch had not dared to look
on Agricola but his words expressed so deep a conviction the tones of
his voice revealed so tender an emotion that the poor creature felt her
shame gradually diminish particularly when Agricola added with rising
animation Be satisfied my sweet my noble Magdalen I will be worthy
of this love Believe me it shall yet cause you as much happiness as it
has occasioned tears Why should this love be a motive for estrangement
confusion fear For what is love in the sense in which it is held
by your generous heart Is it not a continual exchange of devotion
tenderness esteem of mutual and blind confidenceWhy Magdalen
we may have all this for one anotherdevotion tenderness
confidenceeven more than in times past for on a thousand occasions
your secret inspired you with fear and suspicionwhile for the future
on the contrary you will see me take such delight in the place I fill
in your good and valiant heart that you will be happy in the happiness
you bestow What I have just said may seem very selfish and conceited
so much the worse I do not know how to lie

The longer the smith spoke the less troubled became Mother Bunch What
she had above all feared in the discovery of her secret was to see it
received with raillery contempt or humiliating compassion far from
this joy and happiness were distinctly visible on the manly and
honest face of Agricola The hunchback knew him incapable of deception
therefore she exclaimed this time without shame or confusion but
rather with a sort of pride

Every sincere and pure passion is so far good and con soling as to end
by deserving interest and sympathy when it has triumphed over its first
excess It is alike honorable to the heart which feels and that which
inspires itThanks to you Agricolathanks to the kind words which
have raised me in my own esteemI feel that instead of blushing I
ought to be proud of this love My benefactress is rightyou are right
why should I be ashamed of it Is it not a true and sacred love To be
near you to love you to tell you so to prove it by constant devotion
what did I ever desire more And yet shame and fear joined with that
dizziness of the brain which extreme misery produces drove me to
suicideBut then some allowance must be made for the suspicions of a
poor creature who has been the subject of ridicule from her cradle
So my secret was to die with me unless some unforeseen accident should
reveal it to you and in that case you are rightsure of myself sure
of you I ought to have feared nothing But I may claim some indulgence
mistrust cruel mistrust of ones self makes one doubt others also Let
us forget all that Agricola my generous brother I will say to you
as you said to me just now Look at me you know my countenance cannot
lie Look at me see if I shun your gaze see if ever in my life I
looked so happyand yet even now I was about to die

She spoke the truth Agricola himself could not have hoped so prompt an
effect from his words In spite of the deep traces which misery grief
and sickness had imprinted on the girls features they now shone with
radiant happiness and serenity whilst her blue eyes gentle and pure as
her soul were fixed without embarrassment on those of Agricola

Oh thanks thanks cried the smith in a rapture of delight when I
see you so calm and so happy Magdalen I am indeed grateful

Yes I am calm I am happy replied she and happy I shall be for
I can now tell you my most secret thoughts Yes happy for this day
which began so fatally ends like a divine dream Far from being afraid
I now look at you with hope and joy I have again found my generous
benefactress and I am tranquil as to the fate of my poor sister
Oh shall we not soon see her I should like her to take part in this
happiness

She seemed so happy that the smith did not dare to inform her of the
death of Cephyse and reserved himself to communicate the same at a
more fitting opportunity Therefore he answered Cephyse being the
stronger has been the more shaken it will not be prudent I am told
to see her today

I will wait then I can repress my impatience I have so much to say to
you

Dear gentle Magdalen

Oh my friend cried the girl interrupting Agricola with tears of
joy I cannot tell you what I feel when I hear you call me Magdalen
It is so sweet so soothing that my heart expands with delight

Poor girl how dreadfully she must have suffered cried the smith
with inexpressible emotion when she displays so much happiness so
much gratitude at being called by her own poor name

But consider my friend that word in your mouth contains a new life
for me If you only knew what hopes what pleasures I can now see
gleaming in the future If you knew all the cherished longings of my
tenderness Your wife the charming Angela with her angel face and
angelsouloh in my turn I can say to you Look at me and see how
sweet that name is to my lips and heart Yes your charming your
good Angela will call me Magdalenand your children Agricola
your childrendear little creaturesto them also I shall be
Magdalentheir good Magdalenand the love I shall bear them will make
them mine as well as their mothersand I shall have my part in
every maternal careand they will belong to us three will they not
AgricolaOh let me let me weep These tears without bitterness do me
so much good they are tears that need not be concealed Thank heaven
thank you my friend those other tears are I trust dried forever

For some seconds this affecting scene had been overlooked by an
invisible witness The smith and Mother Bunch had not perceived Mdlle
de Cardoville standing on the threshold of the door As Mother Bunch
had said this day which dawned with all under such fatal auspices had
become for all a day of ineffable felicity Adrienne too was full of
joy for Djalma had been faithful to her Djalma loved her with passion
The odious appearances of which she had been the dupe and victim
evidently formed part of a new plot of Rodin and it only remained for
Mdlle de Cardoville to discover the end of these machinations

Another joy was reserved for her The happy are quick in detecting
happiness in others and Adrienne guessed by the hunchbacks last
words that there was no longer any secret between the smith and the
sempstress She could not therefore help exclaiming as she entered
Oh this will be the brightest day of my life for I shall not be happy
alone

Agricola and Mother Bunch turned round hastily Lady said the smith
in spite of the promise I made you I could not conceal from Magdalen
that I knew she loved me

Now that I no longer blush for this love before Agricola why should I
blush for it before you lady that told me to be proud of it because
it is noble and pure said Mother Bunch to whom her happiness gave
strength enough to rise and to lean upon Agricolas arm

It is well my friend said Adrienne as she threw her arms round her
to support her only one word to excuse the indiscretion with which
you will perhaps reproach me If I told your secret to M Agricola

Do you know why it was Magdalen cried the smith interrupting
Adrienne It was only another proof of the ladys delicate generosity
I long hesitate to confide to you this secret said she to me this
morning but I have at length made up my mind to it We shall probably
find your adopted sister you have been to her the best of brothers
but many times without knowing it you have wounded her feelings
cruellyand now that you know her secret I trust in your kind heart to
keep it faithfully and so spare the poor child a thousand pangspangs
the more bitter because they come from you and are suffered in
silence Hence when you speak to her of your wife your domestic
happiness take care not to gall that noble and tender heartYes
Magdalen these were the reasons that led the lady to commit what she
called an indiscretion

I want words to thank you now and ever said Mother Bunch

See my friend replied Adrienne how often the designs of the wicked
turn against themselves They feared your devotion to me and therefore
employed that unhappy Florine to steal your journal

So as to drive me from your house with shame lady When I supposed my
most secret thoughts an object of ridicule to all There can be no doubt
such was their plan said Mother Bunch

None my child Well this horrible wickedness which nearly caused
your death now turns to the confusion of the criminals Their plot is
discoveredand luckily many other of their designs said Adrienne
as she thought of RosePompon

Then she resumed with heartfelt joy At last we are again united
happier than ever and in our very happiness we shall find new resources
to combat our enemies I say our enemiesfor all that love me are
odious to these wretches But courage the hour is come and the good
people will have their turn

Thank heaven lady said the smith or my part I shall not be
wanting in zeal What delight to strip them of their mask

Let me remind you M Baudoin that you have an appointment for to
morrow with M Hardy

I have not forgotten it lady any more than the generous offers I am
to convey to him

That is nothing He belongs to my family Tell him what indeed I
shall write to him this evening that the funds necessary to reopen his
factory are at his disposal I do not say so for his sake only but for
that of a hundred families reduced to want Beg him to quit immediately
the fatal abode to which they have taken him for a thousand reasons he
should be on his guard against all that surround him

Be satisfied lady The letter he wrote to me in reply to the one I got
secretly delivered to him was short affectionate sadbut he grants
me the interview I had asked for and I am sure I shall be able to
persuade him to leave that melancholy dwelling and perhaps to depart
with me he has always had so much confidence in my attachment

Well M Baudoin courage said Adrienne as she threw her cloak over
the workgirls shoulders and wrapped her round with care Let us be
gone for it is late As soon as we get home I will give you a letter
for M Hardy and tomorrow you will come and tell me the result of your
visit No not tomorrow she added blushing slightly Write to me
tomorrow and the day after about twelve come to me

Some minutes later the young sempstress supported by Agricola and
Adrienne had descended the stairs of that gloomy house and being
placed in the carriage by the side of Mdlle de Cardoville she
earnestly entreated to be allowed to see Cephyse it was in vain that
Agricola assured her it was impossible and that she should see her the
next day Thanks to the information derived from RosePompon Mdlle de
Cardoville was reasonably suspicious of all those who surrounded Djalma
and she therefore took measures that very evening to have a letter
delivered to the prince by what she considered a sure hand




CHAPTER XXXVIII THE TWO CARRIAGES

It is the evening of the day on which Mdlle de Cardoville prevented the
sewinggirls suicide It strikes eleven the night is dark the
wind blows with violence and drives along great black clouds which
completely hide the pale lustre of the moon A hackneycoach drawn by
two brokenwinded horses ascends slowly and with difficulty the slope
of the Rue Blanche which is pretty steep near the barrier in the part
where is situated the house occupied by Djalma

The coach stops The coachman cursing the length of an interminable
drive within the circuit leading at last to this difficult ascent
turns round on his box leans over towards the front window of the
vehicle and says in a gruff tone to the person he is driving Come
are we almost there From the Rue de Vaugirard to the Barriere Blanche
is a pretty good stretch I think without reckoning that the night
is so dark that one can hardly see two steps before oneand the
streetlamps not lighted because of the moon which doesnt shine after
all

Look out for a little door with a porticodrive on about twenty yards
beyondand then stop close to the wall answered a squeaking voice
impatiently and with an Italian accent

Here is a beggarly Dutchman that will make me as savage as a bear
muttered the angry Jehu to himself Then he added Thousand thunders
I tell you that I cant see How the devil can I find out your little
door

Have you no sense Follow the wall to the right brush against it and
you will easily find the little door It is next to No 50 If you do
not find it you must be drunk answered the Italian with increased
bitterness

The coachman only replied by swearing like a trooper and whipping up
his jaded horses Then keeping close to the wall he strained his eyes
in trying to read the numbers of the houses by the aid of his carriage
lamps

After some moments the coach again stopped I have passed No 50 and
here is a little door with a portico said the coachman Is that the
one

Yes said the voice Now go forward some twenty yards and then
stop

Well I never

Then get down from your box and give twice three knocks at the little
door we have just passedyou understand metwice three knocks

Is that all you give me to drink cried the exasperated coachman

When you have taken me back to the Faubourg SaintGermain where I
live you shall have something handsome if you do but manage matters
well

Ha now the Faubourg SaintGermain Only that little bit of distance
said the driver with repressed rage And I who have winded my horses
wanted to be on the boulevard by the time the play was out Well
Im blowed Then putting a good face on his bad luck and consoling
himself with the thought of the promised drinkmoney he resumed I am
to give twice three knocks at the little door

Yes three knocks firstthen pausethen three other knocks Do you
understand

What next

Tell the person who comes that he is waited for and bring him here to
the coach

The devil burn you said the coachman to himself as he turned round
on the box and whipped up his horses adding this crusty old Dutchman
has something to do with Freemasons or perhaps smugglers seeing we
are so near the gates He deserves my giving him in charge for bringing
me all the way from the Rue de Vaugirard

At twenty steps beyond the little door the coach again stopped and the
coachman descended from the box to execute the orders he had received
Going to the little door he knocked three times then paused as he had
been desired and then knocked three times more The clouds which had
hitherto been so thick as entirely to conceal the disk of the moon just
then withdrew sufficiently to afford a glimmering light so that when
the door opened at the signal the coachman saw a middlesized person
issue from it wrapped in a cloak and wearing a colored cap

This man carefully locked the door and then advanced two steps into the
street They are waiting for you said the coachman I am to take you
along with me to the coach

Preceding the man with the cloak who only answered him by a nod he led
him to the coachdoor which he was about to open and to let down the
step when the voice exclaimed from the inside It is not necessary
The gentleman may talk to me through the window I will call you when it
is time to start

Which means that I shall be kept here long enough to send you to all
the devils murmured the driver However I may as well walk about
just to stretch my legs

So saying he began to walk up and down by the side of the wall in
which was the little door Presently he heard the distant sound of
wheels which soon came nearer and nearer and a carriage rapidly
ascending the slope stopped on the other side of the little
gardendoor

Come I say a private carriage said the coachman Good horses
those to come up the Rue Blanche at a trot

The coachman was just making this observation when by favor of a
momentary gleam of light he saw a man step from the carriage advance
rapidly to the little door open it and go in closing it after him

It gets thicker and thicker said the coachman One comes out and
the other goes in

So saying he walked up to the carriage It was splendidly harnessed
and drawn by two handsome and vigorous horses The driver sat
motionless in his great boxcoat with the handle of his whip resting
on his right knee

Heres weather to drive about in with such tidy dukes as yours
comrade said the humble hackneycoachman to this automaton who
remained mute and impassible without even appearing to know that he was
spoken to

He doesnt understand Frenchhes an Englishman One could tell that
by his horses said the coachman putting this interpretation on the
silence of his brother whip Then perceiving a tall footman at a little
distance dressed in a long gray livery coat with blue collar and
silver buttons the coachman addressed himself to him by way of
compensation but without much varying his phrase Heres nice weather
to stand about in comrade On the part of the footman he was met with
the same imperturbable silence

Theyre both Englishmen resumed the coachman philosophically
and though somewhat astonished at the incident of the little door he
recommenced his walk in the direction of his own vehicle

While these facts were passing the man in the cloak and the man with
the Italian accent continued their conversation the one still in the
coach and the other leaning with his hand on the door It had already
lasted for some time and was carried on in Italian They were evidently
talking of some absent person as will appear from the following

So said the voice from the coach that is agreed to

Yes my lord answered the man in the cloak but only in case the
eagle should become a serpent

And in the contrary event you will receive the other half of the
ivory crucifix I gave you

I shall know what it means my lord

Continue to merit and preserve his confidence

I will merit and preserve it my lord because I admire and respect
this man who is stronger than the strongest by craft and courage and
will I have knelt before him with humility as I would kneel before one
of the three black idols that stand between Bowanee and her worshippers
for his religion like mine teaches to change life into nothingness

Humph said the voice in a tone of some embarrassment these
comparisons are useless and inaccurate Only think of obeying him
without explaining your obedience

Let him speak and I perform his will I am in his hands like a corpse
as he himself expresses it He has seen he sees every day my devotion
to his interests with regard to Prince Djalma He has only to say Kill
himand this son of a king

For heavens salve do not have such ideas cried the voice
interrupting the man in the cloak Thank heaven you will never be
asked for such proofs of your submission

What I am ordered I do Bowanee sees me

I do not doubt your zeal I know that you are a loving and intelligent
barrier placed between the prince and many guilty interests and it is
because I have heard of that zeal of your skill in circumventing this
young Indian and above all of the motives of your blind devotion
that I have wished to inform you of everything You are the fanatical
worshipper of him you serve That is well man should be the obedient
slave of the god he chooses for himself

Yes my lord so long as the god remains a god

We understand each other perfectly As for your recompense you know
what I have promised

My lord I have my reward already

How so

I know what I know

Very well Then as for secrecy

You have securities my lord

Yesand sufficient ones

The interest of the cause I serve my lord would alone be enough to
secure my zeal and discretion

True you are a man of firm and ardent convictions

I strive to be so my lord

And after all a very religious man in your way It is very
praiseworthy in these irreligious times to have any views at all on
such mattersparticularly when those views will just enable me to count
upon your aid

You may count upon it my lord for the same reason that the intrepid
hunter prefers a jackal to ten foxes a tiger to ten jackals a lion to
ten tigers and the welmiss to ten lions

What is the welmiss

It is what spirit is to matter the blade to the scabbard the perfume
to the flower the head to the body

I understand There never was a more just comparison You are a man of
sound judgment Always recollect what you have just told me and make
yourself more and more worthy of the confidence ofyour idol

Will he soon be in a state to hear me my lord

In two or three days at most Yesterday a providential crisis saved
his life and he is endowed with so energetic a will that his cure will
be very rapid

Shall you see him again tomorrow my lord

Yes before my departure to bid him farewell

Then tell him a strange circumstance of which I have not been able to
inform him but which happened yesterday

What was it

I had gone to the garden of the dead I saw funerals everywhere and
lighted torches in the midst of the black night shining upon tombs
Bowanee smiled in her ebon sky As I thought of that divinity of
destruction I beheld with joy the deadcart emptied of its coffins
The immense pit yawned like the mouth of hell corpses were heaped
upon corpses and still it yawned the same Suddenly by the light of a
torch I saw an old man beside me He wept I had seen him before He is
a Jewthe keeper of the house in the Rue SaintFrancoisyou know what
I mean Here the man in the cloak started

Yes I know but what is the matter why do you stop short

Because in that house there has been for a hundred and fifty years the
portrait of a man whom I once met in the centre of India on the banks
of the Ganges And the man in the cloak again paused and shuddered

A singular resemblance no doubt

Yes my lord a singular resemblancenothing more

But the Jewthe old Jew

I am coming to that my lord Still weeping he said to a gravedigger
Well and the coffin You were right answered the man I found it
in the second row of the other grave It had the figure of a cross on
it formed by seven black nails But how could you know the place and
the mark Alas it is no matter replied the old Jew with bitter
melancholy You see that I was but too well informed on the subject
But where is the coffin Behind the great tomb of black marble I have
hidden it there So make haste for in the confusion nothing will be
noticed You have paid me well and I wish you to succeed in what you
require

And what did the old Jew do with the coffin marked with the seven black
nails

Two men accompanied him my lord bearing a covered litter with
curtains drawn round it He lighted a lantern and followed by these
two men went towards the place pointed out by the gravedigger A
stoppage occasioned by the deadcarts made me lose sight of the old
Jew whom I was following amongst the tombs Afterwards I was unable to
find him

It is indeed a strange affair What could this old Jew want with the
coffin

It is said my lord that they use dead bodies in preparing their magic
charms

Those unbelievers are capable of anythingeven of holding
communication with the Enemy of mankind However we will look after
this the discovery may be of importance

At this instant a clock struck twelve in the distance

Midnight already

Yes my lord

I must be gone Goodbyebut for the last time swear to me that
should matters so turn out as soon as you receive the other half of the
ivory crucifix I have just given you you will keep your promise

I have sworn it by Bowanee my lord

Dont forget that to make all sure the person who will deliver to you
the other half of the crucifix is to saycome what is he to say

He is to say my lord There is many a slip twixt the cup and the
lip

Very well Adieu secrecy and fidelity

Secrecy and fidelity my lord answered the man in the cloak

Some seconds after the hackneycoach started carrying with it Cardinal
Malipieri one of the speakers in the above dialogue The other whom
the reader has no doubt recognized as Faringhea returned to the little
gardendoor of the house occupied by Djalma At the moment he
was putting the key into the lock the door opened to his great
astonishment and a man came forth Faringhea rushed upon the unknown
seized him violently by the collar and exclaimed Who are you whence
came you

The stranger evidently found the tone of this question anything but
satisfactory for instead of answering he struggled to disengage
himself from Faringheas hold and cried out in a loud voice Help
Peter

Instantly the carriage which had been standing a few yards off dashed
up at full speed and Peter the tall footman seizing the halfbreed by
the shoulders flung him back several paces and thus made a seasonable
diversion in favor of the unknown

Now sir said the latter to Faringhea shaking himself and still
protected by the gigantic footman I am in a state to answer your
questions though you certainly have a very rough way of receiving an
old acquaintance I am Dupont exbailiff of the estate of Cardoville
and it was I who helped to fish you out of the water when the ship was
wrecked in which you had embarked

By the light of the carriagelamps indeed the halfcaste
recognized the good honest face of Dupont formerly bailiff and now
housesteward to Mdlle de Cardoville It must not be forgotten that
Dupont had been the first to write to Mdlle de Cardoville to ask her
to interest herself for Djalma who was then detained at Cardoville
Castle by the injuries he had received during the shipwreck

But sir what is your business here Why do you introduce yourself
clandestinely into this house said Faringhea in an abrupt and
suspicious tone

I willjust observe to you that there is nothing clandestine in the
matter I came here in a carriage with servants in the livery of my
excellent mistress Mdlle de Cardoville charged by her without any
disguise or mystery to deliver a letter to Prince Djalma her cousin
replied Dupont with dignity

On these words Faringhea trembled with mute rage as he answered And
why sir come at this late hour and introduce yourself by this little
door

I came at this hour my dear sir because such was Mdlle de
Cardovilles command and I entered by this little gate because there is
every reason to believe that if I had gone around to the other I should
not have been permitted to see the prince

You are mistaken sir replied the halfcaste

It is possible but as we knew that the prince usually passed a good
portion of the night in the little saloon which communicates with the
greenhouse and as Mdlle de Cardoville had kept a duplicate key of this
door I was pretty certain by taking this course to be able to deliver
into the princes own hands the letter from Mdlle de Cardoville his
cousin which I have now had the honor of doing my dear sir and I have
been deeply touched by the kindness with which the prince deigned to
receive me and to remember our last interview

And who kept you so well informed sir of the princes habits said
Faringhea unable to control his vexation

If I have been well informed as to his habits my dear sir I have had
no such correct knowledge of yours answered Dupont with a mocking
air for I assure you that I had no more notion of seeing you than you
had of seeing me

So saying M Dupont bowed with something like mock politeness to the
halfcaste and got into the carriage which drove off rapidly leaving
Faringhea in a state of the utmost surprise and anger




CHAPTER XXXIX THE APPOINTMENT

The morning afterDuponts mission to Prince Djalma the latter was
walking with hasty and impatient step up and down the little saloon
which communicated as we already know with the greenhouse from which
Adrienne had entered when she first appeared to him In remembrance of
that day he had chosen to dress himself as on the occasion in question
he wore the same tunic of white cashmere with a cherrycolored turban
to match with his girdle his gaiters of scarlet velvet embroidered
with silver displayed the fine form of his leg and terminated in small
white morocco slippers with red heels Happiness has so instantaneous
and as it were material an influence upon young lively and ardent
natures that Djalma dejected and despairing only the day before
was no longer like the same person The pale transparent gold of his
complexion was no longer tarnished by a livid hue His large eyes of
late obscured like black diamonds by a humid vapor now shone with mild
radiance in the centre of their pearly setting his lips long pale
had recovered their natural color which was rich and soft as the fine
purple flowers of his country

Ever and anon pausing in his hasty walk he stopped suddenly and
drew from his bosom a little piece of paper carefully folded which he
pressed to his lips with enthusiastic ardor Then unable to restrain
the expression of his full happiness he uttered a full and sonorous
cry of joy and with a bound he was in front of the plateglass which
separated the saloon from the conservatory in which he had first seen
Mdlle de Cardoville By a singular power of remembrance or marvellous
hallucination of a mind possessed by a fixed idea Djalma had often
seen or fancied he saw the adored semblance of Adrienne appear to him
through this sheet of crystal The illusion had been so complete that
with his eyes ardently fixed on the vision he invoked he had been able
with the aid of a pencil dipped in carmine to trace with astonishing
exactness the profile of the ideal countenance which the delirium
of his imagination had presented to his view42 It was before
these delicate lines of bright carmine that Djalma now stood in deep
contemplation after perusing and reperusing and raising twenty times
to his lips the letter he had received the night before from the hands
of Dupont Djalma was not alone Faringhea watched all the movements
of the prince with a subtle attentive and gloomy aspect Standing
respectfully in a corner of the saloon the halfcaste appeared to be
occupied in unfolding and spreading out Djalmas sash light silky
Indian web the brown ground of which was almost entirely concealed by
the exquisite gold and silver embroidery with which it was overlaid

The countenance of the halfcaste wore a dark and gloomy expression
He could not deceive himself The letter from Mdlle de Cardoville
delivered by Dupont to Djalma must have been the cause of the delight
he now experienced for without doubt he knew himself beloved In that
event his obstinate silence towards Faringhea ever since the latter
had entered the saloon greatly alarmed the halfcaste who could not
tell what interpretation to put upon it The night before after parting
with Dupont he had hastened in a state of anxiety easily understood
to look for the prince in the hope of ascertaining the effect produced
by Mdlle de Cardovilles letter But he found the parlor door closed
and when he knocked he received no answer from within Then though the
night was far advanced he had dispatched a note to Rodin in which he
informed him of Duponts visit and its probable intention Djalma had
indeed passed the night in a tumult of happiness and hope and a fever
of impatience quite impossible to describe Repairing to his bedchamber
only towards the morning he had taken a few moments of repose and had
then dressed himself without assistance

Many times but in vain the halfcaste had discreetly knocked at
the door of Djalmas apartment It was only in the early part of the
afternoon that the prince had rung the bell to order his carriage to be
ready by halfpast two Faringhea having presented himself the prince
had given him the order without looking at him as he might have done to
any other of his servants Was this suspicion aversion or mere absence
of mind on the part of Djalma Such were the questions which the half
caste put to himself with growing anguish for the designs of which he
was the most active and immediate instrument might all be ruined by the
least suspicion in the prince

Oh the hoursthe hourshow slow they are cried the young Indian
suddenly in a low and trembling voice

The day before yesterday my lord you said the hours were very long
observed Faringhea as he drew near Djalma in order to attract his
attention Seeing that he did not succeed in this he advanced a few
steps nearer and resumed Your joy seems very great my lord tell the
cause of it to your poor and faithful servant that he also may rejoice
with you

If he heard the words Djalma did not pay any attention to them He made
no answer and his large black eyes gazed upon vacancy He seemed to
smile admiringly upon some enchanting vision and he folded his two
hands upon his bosom in the attitude which his countrymen assume at
the hour of prayer After some instants of contemplation he said What
oclock is itbut he asked this question of himself rather than of
any third person

It will soon be two oclock my lord said Faringhea

Having heard this answer Djalma seated himself and hid his face in his
hands as if completely absorbed in some ineffable meditation Urged on
by his growing anxiety and wishing at any cost to attract the attention
of Djalma Faringhea approached still nearer to him and almost certain
of the effect of the words he was about to utter said to him in a slow
and emphatic voice My lord I am sure that you owe the happiness which
now transports you to Mdlle de Cardoville

Hardly had this name been pronounced than Djalma started from his
chair looked the halfbreed full in the face and exclaimed as if only
just aware of his presence Faringhea you herewhat is the matter

Your faithful servant shares in your joy my lord

What joy

That which the letter of Mdlle de Cardoville has occasioned my lord

Djalma returned no answer but his eye shone with so much serene
happiness that the halfcaste recovered from his apprehensions No
cloud of doubt or suspicion obscured the radiant features of the prince
After a few moments of silence Djalma fixed upon the halfcaste a look
halfveiled with a tear of joy and said to him with the expression of
one whose heart overflows with love and happiness Oh such delight is
goodgreatlike heavenfor it is heaven which

You deserve this happiness my lord after so many sufferings

What sufferingsOh yes I formerly suffered at Java but that was
years ago

My lord this great good fortune does not astonish me What have I
always told you Do not despair feign a violent passion for some other
woman and then this proud young lady

At these words Djalma looked at the halfcaste with so piercing a
glance that the latter stopped short but the prince said to him with
affectionate goodness Go on I listen

Then leaning his chin upon his hand and his elbow on his knee he
gazed so intently on Faringhea and yet with such unutterable mildness
that even that iron soul was touched for a moment with a slight feeling
of remorse

I was saying my lord he resumed that by following the counsels of
your faithful slave who persuaded you to feign a passionate love for
another woman you have brought the proud Mdlle de Cardoville to come
to you Did I not tell you it would be so

Yes you did tell me so answered Djalma still maintaining the same
position and examining the halfcaste with the same fixed and mild
attention

The surprise of Faringhea increased generally the prince without
treating him with the least harshness preserved the somewhat distant
and imperious manners of their common country and he had never before
spoken to him with such extreme mildness Knowing all the evil he
had done the prince and suspicious as the wicked must ever be the
halfcaste thought for a moment that his masters apparent kindness
might conceal a snare He continued therefore with less assurance
Believe me my lord this day if you do but know how to profit by your
advantages will console you for all your troubles which have indeed
been greatfor only yesterday though you were generous enough to
forget it only yesterday you suffered cruellybut you were not alone
in your sufferings This proud young lady suffered also

Do you think so said Djalma

Oh it is quite sure my lord What must she not have felt when she
saw you at the theatre with another womanIf she loved you only a
little she must have been deeply wounded in her selfesteem if she
loved you with passion she must have been struck to the heart At
length you see wearied out with suffering she has come to you

So that any way she must have sufferedand that does not move your
pity said Djalma in a constrained but still very mild voice

Before thinking of others my lord I think of your distresses and
they touch me too nearly to leave me any pity for other woes added
Faringhea hypocritically so greatly had the influence of Rodin already
modified the character of the Phansegar

It is strange said Djalma speaking to himself as he viewed the half
caste with a glance still kind but piercing

What is strange my lord

Nothing But tell me since your advice has hitherto prospered so well
what think you of the future

Of the future my lord

Yes in an hour I shall be with Mdlle de Cardoville

That is a serious matter my lord The whole future will depend upon
this interview

That is what I was just thinking

Believe me my lord women never love any so well as the bold man who
spares them the embarrassment of a refusal

Explain more fully

Well my lord they despise the timid and languishing lover who asks
humbly for what he might take by force

But today I shall meet Mdlle de Cardoville for the first time

You have met her a thousand times in your dreams my lord and depend
upon it she has seen you also in her dreams since she loves you Every
one of your amorous thoughts has found an echo in her heart All your
ardent adorations have been responded to by her Love has not two
languages and without meeting you have said all that you had to say
to each other Now it is for you to act as her master and she will be
yours entirely

It is strangevery strange said Djalma a second time without
removing his eyes from Faringheas face

Mistaking the sense which the prince attached to these words the half
caste resumed Believe me my lord however strange it may appear this
is the wisest course Remember the past Was it by playing the part of a
timid lover that you have brought to your feet this proud young lady
my lord No it was by pretending to despise her in favor of another
woman Therefore let us have no weakness The lion does not woo like
the poor turtledove What cares the sultan of the desert for a few
plaintive howls from the lioness who is more pleased than angry at his
rude and wild caresses Soon submissive fearful and happy she follows
in the track of her master Believe me my lordtry everythingdare
everythingand today you will become the adored sultan of this young
lady whose beauty all Paris admires

After some minutes silence Djalma shaking his head with an expression
of tender pity said to the halfcaste in his mild sonorous voice
Why betray me thus Why advise me thus wickedly to use violence
terror and surprise towards an angel of purity whom I respect as
my mother Is it not enough for you to have been so long devoted to my
enemies whose hatred has followed me from Java

Had Djalma sprung upon the halfcaste with bloodshot eye menacing
brow and lifted poniard the latter would have been less surprised
and perhaps less frightened than when he heard the prince speak of his
treachery in this tone of mild reproach

He drew back hastily as if about to stand on his guard But Djalma
resumed with the same gentleness Fear nothing Yesterday I should
have killed you But today happy love renders me too just too merciful
for that I pity you without any feeling of bitternessfor you must
have been very unhappy or you could not have become so wicked

My lord said the halfcaste with growing amazement

Yes you must have suffered much and met with little mercy poor
creature to have become so merciless in your hate and proof against
the sight of a happiness like mine When I listened to you just now
and saw the sad perseverance of your hatred I felt the deepest
commiseration for you

I do not know my lordbut stammered the halfcaste and was unable
to find words to proceed

Come nowwhat harm have I ever done you

None my lord answered Faringhea

Then why do you hate me thus why pursue me with so much animosity Was
it not enough to give me the perfidious counsel to feign a shameful love
for the young girl that was brought hither and who quitted the house
disgusted at the miserable part she was to play

Your feigned love for that young girl my lord replied Faringhea
gradually recovering his presence of mind conquered the coldness of

Do not say that resumed the prince interrupting him with the same
mildness If I enjoy this happiness which makes me compassionate
towards you and raises me above myself it is because Mdlle de
Cardoville now knows that I have never for a moment ceased to love her
as she ought to be loved with adoration and reverence It was your
intention to have parted us forever and you had nearly succeeded

If you think this of me my lord you must look upon me as your most
mortal enemy

Fear nothing I tell you I have no right to blame you In the madness
of my grief I listened to you and followed your advice I was not only
your dupe but your accomplice Only confess that when you saw me at
your mercy dejected crushed despairing it was cruel in you to advise
the course that might have been most fatal to me

The ardor of my zeal may have deceived me my lord

I am willing to believe it And yet again today there were the same
evil counsels You had no more pity for my happiness than for my sorrow
The rapture of my heart inspires you with only one desirethat of
changing this rapture into despair

I my lord

Yes you It was your intention to ruin meto dishonor me forever in
the eyes of Mdlle de Cardoville Now tell mewhy this furious hate
what have I done to you

You misjudge me my lordand

Listen to me I do not wish you to be any longer wicked and
treacherous I wish to make you good In our country they charm
serpents and tame the wildest tigers You are a man with a mind to
reason a heart to love and I will tame you too by gentleness This day
has bestowed on me divine happiness you shall have good cause to bless
this day What can I do for you what would you havegold You shall
have it Do you desire more than gold Do you desire a friend to
console you for the sorrows that made you wicked and to teach you to
be good Though a kings son I will be that friendin spite of the
evilay because of the evil you have done me Yes I will be your
sincere friend and it shall be my delight to say to myself The day
on which I learned that my angel loved me my happiness was great
indeedfor in the morning I had an implacable enemy and ere night
his hatred was changed to friendship Believe me Faringhea misery
makes crime but happiness produces virtue Be happy

At this moment the clock struck two The prince started It was time to
go on his visit to Adrienne The handsome countenance of Djalma doubly
embellished by the mild ineffable expression with which it had been
animated whilst he was talking to the halfcaste now seemed illumined
with almost divine radiance

Approaching Faringhea he extended his hand with the utmost grace and
courtesy saying to him Your hand

The halfcaste whose brow was bathed with a cold sweat whose
countenance was pale and agitated seemed to hesitate for an instant
then overawed conquered fascinated he offered his trembling hand to
the prince who pressed it and said to him in their countrys fashion
You have laid your hand honestly in a friends this hand shall never
be closed against you Faringhea farewell I now feel myself more
worthy to kneel before my angel

And Djalma went out on his way to the appointment with Adrienne In
spite of his ferocity in spite of the pitiless hate he bore to the
whole human race the dark sectary of Bowanee was staggered by the noble
and clement words of Djalma and said to himself with terror I have
taken his hand He is now sacred for me

Then after a moments silence a thought occurred to him and he
exclaimed Yesbut he will not be sacred for him who according to the
answer of last night waits for him at the door of the house

So saying the halfcaste hastened into the next room which looked upon
the street and raising a corner of the curtain muttered anxiously to
himself The carriage moves offthe man approaches Perdition it is
gone and I see no more




CHAPTER XL ANXIETY

By a singular coincidence of ideas Adrienne like Djalma had wished
to be dressed exactly in the same costume as at their interview in
the house in the Rue Blanche For the site of this solemn meeting so
important to her future happiness Adrienne had chosen with habitual
tact the grand drawingroom of Cardoville House in which hung many
family portraits The most apparent were those of her father and mother
The room was large and lofty and furnished like those which preceded
it with all the imposing splendor of the age of Louis XIV The ceiling
painted by Lebrun to represent the Triumph of Apollo displayed his
bold designing and vigorous coloring in the centre of a wide cornice
magnificently carved and gilt and supported at its angles by four
large gilt figures representing the Seasons Huge panels covered
with crimson damask and set in frames served as the background to the
family portraits which adorned this apartment It is easier to conceive
than describe the thousand conflicting emotions which agitated the bosom
of Mdlle de Cardoville as the moment approached for her interview with
Djalma Their meeting had been hitherto prevented by so many painful
obstacles and Adrienne was so well aware of the vigilant and active
perfidy of her enemies that even now she doubted of her happiness
Every instant in spite of herself her eyes wandered to the clock
A few minutes more and the hour of the appointment would strike
It struck at last Every reverberation was echoed from the depth of
Adriennes heart She considered that Djalmas modest reserve had
doubtless prevented his coming before the moment fixed by herself Far
from blaming this discretion she fully appreciated it But from that
moment at the least noise in the adjoining apartments she held her
breath and listened with the anxiety of expectation

For the first few minutes which followed the hour at which she expected
Djalma Mdlle de Cardoville felt no serious apprehension and calmed
her impatience by the notion which appears childish enough to those who
have never known the feverish agitation of waiting for a happy meeting
that perhaps the clocks in the Rue Blanche might vary a little from
those in the Rue dAnjou But when this supposed variation conceivable
enough in itself could no longer explain a delay of a quarter of an
hour of twenty minutes of more Adrienne felt her anxiety gradually
increase Two or three times the young girl rose with palpitating
heart and went on tiptoe to listen at the door of the saloon She
heard nothing The clock struck halfpast three

Unable to suppress her growing terror and clinging to a last hope
Adrienne returned towards the fireplace and rang the bell After which
she endeavored to compose her features so as to betray no outward sign
of emotion In a few seconds a grayhaired footman dressed in black
opened the door and waited in respectful silence for the orders of his
mistress The latter said to him in a calm voice Andrew request Hebe
to give you the smelling bottle that I left on the chimneypiece in my
room and bring it me here Andrew bowed but just as he was about
to withdraw to execute Adriennes orders which was only a pretext to
enable her to ask a question without appearing to attach much importance
to it in her servants eyes already informed of the expected visit of
the prince Mdlle de Cardoville added with an air of indifference
Pray is that clock right

Andrew drew out his watch and replied as he cast his eyes upon it
Yes mademoiselle I set my watch by the Tuileries It is more than
half past three

Very wellthank you said Adrienne kindly

Andrew again bowed but before going out he said to Adrienne I
forgot to tell you lady that Marshal Simon called about an hour ago
but as you were only to be at home to Prince Djalma we told him that
you received no company

Very well said Adrienne With another low bow Andrew quitted the
room and all returned to silence

For the precise reason that up to the last minute of the hour previous
to the time fixed for her interview with Djalma the hopes of
Adrienne had not been disturbed by the slightest shadow of doubt the
disappointment she now felt was the more dreadful Casting a desponding
look at one of the portraits placed above her she murmured with a
plaintive and despairing accent Oh mother

Hardly had Mdlle de Cardoville uttered the words than the windows were
slightly shaken by a carriage rolling into the courtyard The young lady
started and was unable to repress a low cry of joy Her heart bounded
at the thought of meeting Djalma for this time she felt that he was
really come She was quite as certain of it as if she had seen him
She resumed her seat and brushed away a tear suspended from her long
eyelashes Her hand trembled like a leaf The sound of several doors
opening and shutting proved that the young lady was right in her
conjecture The gilded panels of the drawingroom door soon turned upon
their hinges and the prince appeared

While a second footman ushered in Djalma Andrew placed on a gilded
table within reach of his mistress a little silver salver on which
stood the crystal smellingbottle Then he withdrew and the door of
the room was closed The prince and Mdlle de Cardoville were left alone
together




CHAPTER XLI ADRIENNE AND DJALMA

The prince had slowly approached Mdlle de Cardoville Notwithstanding
the impetuosity of the Orientals passions his uncertain and timid
steptimid yet gracefulbetrayed his profound emotion He did not
venture to lift his eyes to Adriennes face he had suddenly become very
pale and his finely formed hands folded over his bosom in the attitude
of adoration trembled violently With head bent down he remained
standing at a little distance from Adrienne This embarrassment
ridiculous in any other person appeared touching in this prince of
twenty years of age endowed with an almost fabulous intrepidity and of
so heroic and generous a character that no traveller could speak of
the son of Kadja sing without a tribute of admiration and respect Sweet
emotion chaste reserve doubly interesting if we consider that the
burning passions of this youth were all the more inflammable because
they had hitherto been held in check

No less embarrassed than her cousin Adrienne de Cardoville remained
seated Like Djalma she cast down her eyes but the burning blush on
her cheeks the quick heaving of her virgin bosom revealed an emotion
that she did not even attempt to hide Notwithstanding the powers of her
mind by turns gay graceful and wittynotwithstanding the decision of
her proud and independent character and her complete acquaintance with
the manners of the worldAdrienne shared Djalmas simple and enchanting
awkwardness and partook of that kind of temporary weakness beneath
which these two pure ardent and loving beings appeared sinkingas if
unable to support the boiling agitation of the senses combined with the
intoxicating excitement of the heart And yet their eyes had not met
Each seemed to fear the first electric shock of the others glancethat
invincible attraction of two impassioned beingsthat sacred fire which
suddenly kindles the blood and lifts two mortals from earth to heaven
for it is to approach the Divinity to give ones self up with religious
fervor to the most noble and irresistible sentiment that He has
implanted within usthe only sentiment that in His adorable wisdom
the Dispenser of all good has vouchsafed to sanctify by endowing it
with a spark of His own creative energy

Djalma was the first to raise his eyes They were moist and sparkling
The excitement of passionate love the burning ardor of his age so long
repressed the intense admiration in which he held ideal beauty were
all expressed in his look mingled with respectful timidity and gave
to the countenance of this youth an undefinable irresistible character
Yes irresistiblefor when Adrienne encountered his glance she
trembled in every limb and felt herself attracted by a magnetic power
Already her eyes were heavy with a kind of intoxicating languor when
by a great effort of will and dignity she succeeded in overcoming
this delicious confusion rose from her chair and said to Djalma in
a trembling voice Prince I am happy to receive you here Then
pointing to one of the portraits suspended above her she added as if
introducing him to a living person Princemy mother

With an instinct of rare delicacy Adrienne had thus summoned her mother
to be present at her interview with Djalma It seemed a security
for herself and the prince against the seductions of a first
interviewwhich was likely to be all the more perilous that they both
knew themselves madly loved that they both were free and had only to
answer to Providence for the treasures of happiness and enjoyment
with which He had so magnificently endowed them The prince understood
Adriennes thoughts so that when the young lady pointed to the
portrait Djalma by a spontaneous movement full of grace and
simplicity knelt down before the picture and said to it in a gentle
but manly voice I will love and revere you as my mother And in
thought my mother too shall be present and stand like you beside your
child

No better answer could have been given to the feeling which induced
Mdlle de Cardoville to place herself as it were under the protection
of her mother From that moment confident in Djalma confident in
herself the young lady felt more at her ease and the delicious sense
of happiness replaced those exciting emotions which had at first so
violently agitated her

Then seating herself once more she said to Djalma as she pointed to
the opposite chair Pray take a seat my dear cousin and allow me to
call you so for there is too much ceremony in the word prince and
do you call me cousin also for I find other names too grave Having
settled this point we can talk together like old friends

Yes cousin answered Djalma blushing

And as frankness is proper between friends resumed Adrienne I have
first to make you a reproach she added with a halfsmile

The prince had remained standing with his arm resting on the chimney
piece in an attitude full of grace and respect

Yes cousin continued Adrienne a reproach that you will perhaps
forgive me for making I had expected you a little sooner

Perhaps cousin you may blame me for having come so soon

What do you mean

At the moment when I left home a man whom I did not know approached
my carriage and said to me with such an air of sincerity that I
believed him You are able to save the life of a person who has been a
second father to you Marshal Simon is in great danger and to rescue
him you must follow me on the instant

It was a snare cried Adrienne hastily Marshal Simon was here
scarcely an hour ago

Indeed exclaimed Djalma joyfully and as if he had been relieved
from a great weight Then there will be nothing to sadden this happy
day

But cousin resumed Adrienne how came you not to suspect this
emissary

Some words which afterwards escaped from him inspired me with
doubts answered Djalma but at first I followed him fearing the
marshal might be in dangerfor I know that he also has enemies

Now that I reflect on it you were quite right cousin for some new
plot against the marshal was probable enough and the least doubt was
enough to induce you to go to him

I did soeven though you were waiting for me

It was a generous sacrifice and my esteem for you is increased by it
if it could be increased said Adrienne with emotion But what became
of this man

At my desire he got into the carriage with me Anxious about the
marshal and in despair at seeing the time wasted that I was to have
passed with you cousin I pressed him with all sorts of questions
Several times he replied to me with embarrassment and then the idea
struck me that the whole might be a snare Remembering all that they had
already attempted to ruin me in your opinion I immediately changed
my course The vexation of the man who accompanied me then because so
visible that I ought to have had no doubt upon the subject Still when
I thought of Marshal Simon I felt a kind of vague remorse which you
cousin have now happily set at rest

Those people are implacable said Adrienne but our happiness will be
stronger than their hate

After a moments silence she resumed with her habitual frankness My
dear cousin it is impossible for me to conceal what I have at heart
Let us talk for a few seconds of the past which was made so painful to
us and then we will forget it forever like an evil dream

I will answer you sincerely at the risk of injuring myself said the
prince

How could you make up your mind to exhibit yourself in public with

With that young girl interrupted Djalma

Yes cousin replied Mdlle de Cardoville and she waited for Djalmas
answer with anxious curiosity

A stranger to the customs of this country said Djalma without
any embarrassment for he spoke the truth with a mind weakened
with despair and misled by the fatal counsels of a man devoted to my
enemies I believed even as I was told that by displaying before
you the semblance of another love I should excite your jealousy and
thus

Enough cousin I understand it all said Adrienne hastily
interrupting Djalma in her turn that she might spare him a painful
confession I too must have been blinded by despair not to have
seen through this wicked plot especially after your rash and intrepid
action To risk death for the sake of my bouquet added Adrienne
shuddering at the mere remembrance But one last question she
resumed though I am already sure of your answer Did you receive a
letter that I wrote to you on the morning of the day in which I saw you
at the theatre

Djalma made no reply A dark cloud passed over his fine countenance
and for a second his features assumed so menacing an expression that
Adrienne was terrified at the effect produced by her words But this
violent agitation soon passed away and Djalmas brow became once more
calm and serene

I have been more merciful that I thought said the prince to Adrienne
who looked at him with astonishment I wished to come hither worthy of
you my cousin I pardoned the man who to serve my enemies had given
me all those fatal counsels The same person I am sure must have
intercepted your letter Just now at the memory of the evils he thus
caused me I for a moment regretted my clemency But then again I
thought of your letter of yesterdayand my anger is all gone

Then the sad time of fear and suspicion is oversuspicion that made
me doubt of your sentiments and you of mine Oh yes far removed from
us be that fatal past cried Adrienne de Cardoville with deep joy

Then as if she had relieved her heart from the last thought of sadness
she continued The future is all your ownthe radiant future without
cloud or obstacle pure in the immensity of its horizon and extending
beyond the reach of sight

It is impossible to describe the tone of enthusiastic hope which
accompanied these words But suddenly Adriennes features assumed an
expression of touching melancholy and she added in a voice of profound
emotion And yetat this hourso many unfortunate creatures suffer
pain

This simple touch of pity for the misfortunes of others at the
moment when the noble maiden herself attained to the highest point of
happiness had such an effect on Djalma that involuntarily he fell
on his knees before Adrienne clasped his hands together and turned
towards her his fine countenance with an almost daring expression
Then hiding his face in his hands he bowed his head without speaking a
single word There was a moment of deep silence Adrienne was the first
to break it as she saw a tear steal through the slender fingers of the
prince

My friend what is the matter she exclaimed as with a movement rapid
as thought she stooped forward and taking hold of Djalmas hands drew
them from before his face That face was bathed in tears

You weep cried Mdlle de Cardoville so much agitated that she kept
the hands of Djalma in her own and unable to dry his tears the young
Hindoo allowed them to flow like so many drops of crystal over the pale
gold of his cheeks

There is not in this wide world a happiness like to mine said the
prince in his soft melodious voice and with a kind of exhaustion
therefore do I feel great sadness and so it should be You give me
heavenand were I to give you the whole earth it would be but a poor
return Alas what can man do for a divinity but humbly bless and
adore He can never hope to return the gifts bestowed and this makes
him suffernot in his pridebut in his heart

Djalma did not exaggerate He said what he really felt and the rather
hyperbolical form familiar to Oriental nations could alone express his
thought The tone of his regret was so sincere his humility so gentle
and full of simplicity that Adrienne also moved to tears answered him
with an effusion of serious tenderness My friend we are both at
the supreme point of happiness Our future felicity appears to have no
limits and yet though derived from different sources sad reflections
have come to both of us It is you see that there are some sorts of
happiness which make you dizzy with their own immensity For a moment
the heart the mind the soul are incapable of containing so much
bliss it overflows and drowns us Thus the flowers sometimes hang their
heads oppressed by the too ardent rays of the sun which is yet their
love and life Oh my friend this sadness may be great but it also
sweet

As she uttered these words the voice of Adrienne grew fainter and
fainter and her head bowed lower as if she were indeed sinking beneath
the weight of her happiness Djalma had remained kneeling before her
his hands in hersso that as she thus bent forward her ivory forehead
and golden hair touched the ambercolored brow and ebon curls of Djalma
And the sweet silent tears of the two young lovers flowed together and
mingled as they fell on their clasped hands

Whilst this scene was passing in Cardoville House Agricola had gone to
the Rue de Vaugirard to deliver a letter from Adrienne to M Hardy




CHAPTER XLII THE IMITATION

As we have already said M Hardy occupied a pavilion in the Retreat
annexed to the house in the Rue de Vaugirard inhabited by a goodly
number of the reverend fathers of the Company of Jesus Nothing could be
calmer and more silent than this dwelling Every one spoke in whispers
and the servants themselves had something oily in their words something
sanctified in their very walk

Like all that is subject to the chilling and destructive influences of
these men this mournfully quiet house was entirely wanting in life
and animation The boarders passed an existence of wearisome and icy
monotony only broken by the use of certain devotional exercises
and thus in accordance with the selfish calculation of the reverend
fathers the mind deprived of all nourishment and all external support
soon began to droop and pine away in solitude The heart seemed to beat
more slowly the soul was benumbed the character weakened at last
all freewill all power of discrimination was extinguished and the
boarders submitting to the same process of selfannihilation as the
novices of the Company became like them mere corpses in the hands
of the brotherhood

The object of these manoeuvres was clear and simple They secured the
means of obtaining all kinds of donations the constant aim of the
skillful policy and merciless cupidity of these priests By the aid of
enormous sums of which they thus become the possessors or the trustees
they follow out and obtain the success of their projects even though
murder incendiarism revolt and all the horrors of civil war excited
by and through them should drench in blood the lands over which they
seek to extend their dark dominion

Such then was the asylum of peace and innocence in which Francois
Hardy had taken refuge He occupied the groundfloor of a summerhouse
which opened upon a portion of the garden His apartments had been
judiciously chosen for we know with what profound and diabolical craft
the reverend fathers avail themselves of material influences to make
a deep impression upon the minds they are moulding to their purpose
Imagine a prospect bounded by a high wall of a blackish gray
halfcovered with ivy the plant peculiar to ruins A dark avenue of
old yewtrees so fit to shade the grave with their sepulchral verdure
extended from this wall to a little semicircle in front of the
apartment generally occupied by M Hardy Two or three mounds of earth
bordered with box symmetrically cut completed the charms of this
garden which in every respect resembled a cemetery

It was about two oclock in the afternoon Though the April sun shone
brightly its rays intercepted by the high wall of which we have
spoken could not penetrate into that portion of the garden obscure
damp and cold as a cavern which communicated with M Hardys
apartment The room was furnished with a perfect sense of the
comfortable A soft carpet covered the floor thick curtains of dark
green baize the same color as the walls sheltered an excellent bed
and hung in folds about the glass door which opened on the garden Some
pieces of mahogany furniture plain but very clean and bright stood
round the room Above the secretary placed just in front of the
bed was a large ivory crucifix upon a black velvet ground The
chimneypiece was adorned with a clock in an ebony case with
ivory ornaments representing all sorts of gloomy emblems such as
hourglasses scythes deathsheads etc Now imagine this scene in
twilight with its solitary and mournful silence only broken at the
hour of prayer by the lugubrious sound of the bells of the neighboring
chapel and you will recognize the infernal skill with which these
dangerous priests know how to turn to account every external object
when they wish to influence the mind of those they are anxious to gain
over

And this was not all After appealing to the senses it was necessary to
address themselves to the intellectand this was the method adopted by
the reverend fathers A single bookbut onewas left as if by chance
within reach This book was Thomas a Kempis Imitation But as it
might happen that M Hardy would not have the courage or the desire to
read this book thoughts and reflections borrowed from its merciless
pages and written in very large characters were suspended in black
frames close to the bed or at other parts within sight so that
involuntarily in the sad leisure of his inactive dejection the
dwellers eyes were almost necessarily attracted by them To that fatal
circle of despairing thoughts they confined the already weakened mind of
this unfortunate man so long a prey to the most acute sorrow What
he read mechanically every instant of the day and night whenever the
blessed sleep fled from his eyes inflamed with tears was not enough
merely to plunge the soul of the victim into incurable despair but also
to reduce him to the corpselike obedience required by the Society of
Jesus In that awful book may be found a thousand terrors to operate
on weak minds a thousand slavish maxims to chain and degrade the
pusillanimous soul

And now imagine M Hardy carried wounded into this house while his
heart torn by bitter grief and the sense of horrible treachery bled
even faster than his external injuries Attended with the utmost care
and thanks to the acknowledged skill of Dr Baleinier M Hardy soon
recovered from the hurts he had received when he threw himself into the
embers of his burning factory Yet in order to favor the projects
of the reverend fathers a drug harmless enough in its effects but
destined to act for a time upon the mind of the patient and often
employed for that purpose in similar important cases by the pious
doctor was administered to Hardy and had kept him pretty long in
a state of mental torpor To a soul agonized by cruel deceptions it
appears an inestimable benefit to be plunged into that kind of torpor
which at least prevents one from dwelling upon the past

Hardy resigned himself entirely to this profound apathy and at length
came to regard it as the supreme good Thus do unfortunate wretches
tortured by cruel diseases accept with gratitude the opiate which kills
them slowly but which at least deadens the sense of pain

In sketching the portrait of M Hardy we tried to give some idea of
the exquisite delicacy of his tender soul of his painful susceptibility
with regard to anything base or wicked and of his extreme goodness
uprightness and generosity We now allude to these admirable qualities
because we must observe that with him as with almost all who possess
them they were not and could not be united with an energetic and
resolute character Admirably persevering in good deeds the influence
of this excellent man was insinuating rather than commanding it was
not by the bold energy and somewhat overbearing will peculiar to other
men of great and noble heart that Hardy had realized the prodigy of his
Common Dwellinghouse it was by affectionate persuasion for with him
mildness took the place of force At sight of any baseness or injustice
he did not rouse himself furious and threatening but he suffered
intense pain He did not boldly attack the criminal but he turned
away from him in pity and sorrow And then his loving heart so full of
feminine delicacy had an irresistible longing for the blessed contact
of dear affections they alone could keep it alive Even as a poor
frail bird dies with the cold when it can no longer lie close to its
brethren and receive and communicate the sweet warmth of the maternal
nest And now this sensitive organization this extremely susceptible
nature receives blow after blow from sorrows and deceptions one of
which would suffice to shake if it did not conquer the firmest and
most resolute character Hardys best friend has infamously betrayed
him His adored mistress has abandoned him

The house which he had founded for the benefit of his workmen whom he
loved as brethren is reduced to a heap of ashes What then happens All
the springs of his soul are at once broken Too feeble to resist
such frightful attacks too fatally deceived to seek refuge in other
affections too much discouraged to think of laying the first stone
of any new edificethis poor heart isolated from every salutary
influence finds oblivion of the world and of itself in a kind of gloomy
torpor And if some remaining instincts of life and affection at
long intervals endeavored to rouse themselves within him and if
halfopening his minds eye which he had kept closed against the
present the past and the future Hardy looks around himwhat does he
see Only these sentences so full of terrible despair

Thou art nothing but dust and ashes Grief and tears art thy portion
Believe not in any son of man There are no such things as friendship or
ties of kindred All human affections are false Die in the morning and
thou wilt be forgotten before night Be humbledespise thyselfand
let others despise thee Think not reason not live notbut commit
thy fate to the hands of a superior who will think and reason for thee
Weep suffer think upon death Yes death always deaththat should
be thy thought when thou thinkestbut it is better not to think at all
Let a feeling of ceaseless woe prepare thy way to heaven It is only by
sorrow that we are welcome to the terrible God whom we adore

Such were the consolations offered to this unfortunate man Affrighted
he again closed his eyes and fell back into his lethargy As for
leaving this gloomy retreat he could not or rather he did not desire
to do so He had lost the power of will and then it must be confessed
he had finished by getting accustomed to this house and liked it
wellthey paid him such discreet attentions and yet left him so
much alone with his griefthere reigned all around such a deathlike
silence which harmonized closely with the silence of his heart and
that was now the tomb of his last love last friendship last hope
All energy was dead within him Then began that slow but inevitable
transformation so judiciously foreseen by Rodin who directed the whole
of this machination even in its smallest details At first alarmed
by the dreadful maxims which surrounded him M Hardy had at length
accustomed himself to read them over almost mechanically just as the
captive in his mournful hours of leisure counts the nails in the door
of his prison or the bars of the grated window This was already a
great point gained by the reverend fathers

And soon his weakened mind was struck with the apparent correctness of
these false and melancholy aphorisms

Thus he read Do not count upon the affection of any human
creatureand he had himself been shamefully betrayed

Man is born to sorrow and despairand he was himself despairing

There is no rest save in the cessation of thoughtand the slumber of
his mind had brought some relief to his pain

Peepholes skillfully concealed by the hangings and in the wainscoting
of these apartments enabled the reverend fathers at all times to see
and hear the boarders and above all to observe their countenance and
manner when they believed themselves to be alone Every exclamation of
grief which escaped Hardy in his gloomy solitude was repeated to Father
dAigrigny by a mysterious listener The reverend father following
scrupulously Rodins instructions had at first visited his boarder very
rarely We have said that when Father dAigrigny wished it he could
display an almost irresistible power of charming and accordingly he
threw all his tact and skill into the interviews he had with Hardy
when he came from time to time to inquire after his health Informed of
everything by his spies and aided by his natural sagacity he soon saw
all the use that might be made of the physical and moral prostration of
the boarder Certain beforehand that Hardy would not take the hint
he spoke to him frequently of the gloom of the house advising him
affectionately to leave it if he felt oppressed by its monotony or at
all events to seek beyond its walls for some pleasure and amusement
To speak of pleasure and amusement to this unfortunate man was in his
present state to insure a refusal and so it of course happened Father
dAigrigny did not at first try to gain the recluses confidence nor
did he speak to him of sorrow but every time he came he appeared to
take such a tender interest in him and showed it by a few simple and
well timed words By degrees these interviews at first so rare became
more frequent and longer Endowed with a flow of honeyed insinuating
and persuasive eloquence Father dAigrigny naturally took for his
theme those gloomy maxims to which Hardys attention was now so often
directed

Supple prudent skillful knowing that the hermit had hitherto
professed that generous natural religion which teaches the grateful
adoration of God the love of humanity the worship of what is just and
good and which disdaining dogmas professes the same veneration for
Marcus Aurelius as for Confucius for Plato as for Christ for Moses as
for LycurgusFather dAigrigny did not at first attempt to convert
him but began by incessantly reminding him of the abominable deceptions
practised upon him and instead of describing such treachery as an
exception in lifeinstead of trying to calm encourage and revive
his drooping soulinstead of exhorting Hardy to seek oblivion and
consolation in the discharge of his duties toward humanity towards his
brethren whom he had previously loved and succoredFather dAigrigny
strove to inflame the bleeding wounds of the unfortunate man painted
the human race in the most atrocious blackness and by declaring all
men treacherous ungrateful wicked succeeded in rendering his despair
incurable Having attained this object the Jesuit took another step
Knowing Hardys admirable goodness of heart and profiting by the
weakened state of his mind he spoke to him of the consolation to be
derived by a man overwhelmed with sorrow from the belief that every one
of his tears instead of being unfruitful was in fact agreeable to God
and might aid in the salvation of soulsthe belief as the reverend
father adroitly added that by faith alone can sorrow be made useful to
humanity and acceptable to Divinity

Whatever impiety whatever atrocious Machiavelism there was in these
detestable maxims which make of a lovingkind Deity a being delighted
with the tears of his creatures was thus skillfully concealed from
Hardys eyes whose generous instincts were still alive Soon did this
loving and tender soul whom unworthy priests were driving to a sort of
moral suicide find a mournful charm in the fiction that his sorrows
would at least be profitable to other men It was at first only a
fiction but the enfeebled mind which takes pleasure in such a fable
finishes by receiving it as a reality and by degrees will submit to the
consequences Such was Hardys moral and physical state when by means
of a servant who had been bought over he received from Agricola Baudoin
a letter requesting an interview Alone the workman could not have
broken the band of the Jesuits pleadings but he was accompanied by
Gabriel whose eloquence and reasonings were of a most convincing nature
to a spirit like Hardys

It is unnecessary to point out to the reader with what dignified
reserve Gabriel had confined himself to the most generous means of
rescuing Hardy from the deadly influence of the reverend fathers It
was repugnant to the great soul of the young missionary to stoop to
a revelation of the odious plots of these priests He would only have
taken this extreme course had his powerful and sympathetic words have
failed to have any effect on Hardys blindness About a quarter of an
hour had elapsed since Gabriels departure when the servant appointed
to wait on this boarder of the reverend fathers entered and delivered to
him a letter

From whom is this asked Hardy

From a boarder in the house sir answered the servant bowing

This man had a crafty hypocritical face he wore his hair combed over
his forehead spoke in a low voice and always cast clown his eyes
Waiting the answer he joined his hands and began to twiddle his
thumbs Hardy opened the letter and read as follows

SIRI have only just heard by mere chance that you also inhabit
this respectable house a long illness and the retirement in which I
live will explain my ignorance of your being so near Though we have
only met once sir the circumstance which led to that meeting was of so
serious a nature that I cannot think you have forgotten it

Hardy stopped and tasked his memory for an explanation and not finding
anything to put him on the right track he continued to read

This circumstance excited in me a feeling of such deep and respectful
sympathy for you sir that I cannot resist my anxious desire to wait
upon you particularly as I learn that you intend leaving this house to
daya piece of information I have just derived from the excellent and
worthy Abbe Gabriel one of the men I most love esteem and reverence
May I venture to hope sir that just at the moment of quitting our
common retreat to return to the world you will deign to receive
favorably the request however intrusive of a poor old man whose life
will henceforth be passed in solitude and who cannot therefore have
any prospect of meeting you in that vortex of society which he has
abandoned forever Waiting the honor of your answer I beg you to
accept sir the assurance of the sentiments of high esteem with which I
remain sir with the deepest respect

Your very humble and most obedient servant

RODIN

After reading this letter and the signature of the writer Hardy
remained for some time in deep thought without being able to recollect
the name of Rodin or to what serious circumstances he alluded

After a silence of some duration he said to the servant M Rodin gave
you this letter

Yes sir

And who is M Rodin

A good old gentleman who is just recovering from a long illness that
almost carried him off Lately he has been getting better but he is
still so weak and melancholy that it makes one sad to see him It is a
great pity for there is not a better and more worthy gentleman in the
houseunless it be you sir added the servant bowing with an air of
flattering respect

M Rodin said Hardy thoughtfully It is singular that I should not
remember the name nor any circumstance connected with it

If you will give me your answer sir resumed the servant I will
take it to M Rodin He is now with Father dAigrigny to whom he is
bidding farewell

Farewell

Yes sir the posthorses have just come

Posthorses for whom asked Hardy

For Father dAigrigny sir

He is going on a journey then said Hardy with some surprise

Oh he will not I think be long absent said the servant with a
confidential air for the reverend father takes no one with him and
but very light luggage No doubt the reverend father will come to say
farewell to you sir before he starts But what answer shall I give M
Rodin

The letter just received was couched in such polite termsit spoke
of Gabriel with so much respectthat Hardy urged moreover by a natural
curiosity and seeing no motive to refuse this interview before quitting
the house said to the servant Please tell M Rodin that if he will
give himself the trouble to come to me I shall be glad to see him

I will let him know immediately sir answered the servant bowing as
he left the room

When alone Hardy while wondering who this M Rodin could be began
to make some slight preparations for his departure For nothing in the
world would he have passed another night in this house and in order
to keep up his courage he recalled every instant the mild evangelical
language of Gabriel just as the superstitious recite certain litanies
with a view of escaping from temptation

The servant soon returned and said M Rodin is here sir

Beg him to walk in

Rodin entered clad in his long black dressinggown and with his
old silk cap in his hand The servant then withdrew The day was just
closing Hardy rose to meet Rodin whose features he did not at first
distinguish But as the reverend father approached the window Hardy
looked narrowly at him for an instant and then uttered an exclamation
wrung from him by surprise and painful remembrance But recovering
himself from this first movement Hardy said to the Jesuit in an
agitated voice You here sir Oh you are right It was indeed a very
serious circumstance that first brought us together

Oh my dear sir said Rodin in a kindly and unctuous tone I was
sure you would not have forgotten me




CHAPTER XLIII PRAYER

It will doubtless be remembered that Rodin had gone although a stranger
to Hardy to visit him at his factory and inform him of De Blessacs
shameful treacherya dreadful blow which had only preceded by a few
moments a second no less horrible misfortune for it was in the presence
of Rodin that Hardy had learned the unexpected departure of the woman
he adored Painful to him must have been the sudden appearance of
Rodin Yes thanks to the salutary influence of Gabriels counsels he
recovered himself by degrees and the contraction of his features being
succeeded by a melancholy calm he said to Rodin I did not indeed
expect to meet you sir in this house

Alas sir answered Rodin with a sigh I did not expect to come
hither probably to end my days beneath this roof when I went without
being acquainted with you but only as one honest man should serve
another to unveil to you a great infamy

Indeed sir you then rendered me a true service perhaps in that
painful moment I did not fully express my gratitude for at the same
moment in which you revealed to me the treachery of M de Blessac

You were overwhelmed by another piece of painful intelligence said
Rodin interrupting M Hardy I shall never forget the sudden arrival
of that poor woman who pale and affrighted and without considering my
presence came to inform you that a person who was exceedingly dear to
you had quitted Paris abruptly

Yes sir and without stopping to thank you I set out immediately
answered Hardy with a mournful air

Do you know sir said Rodin after a moments silence that there
are sometimes very strange coincidences

To what do you allude sir

While I went to inform you that you were betrayed in so infamous a
mannerI was myself

Rodin paused as if unable to control his deep emotion and his
countenance wore the expression of such overpowering grief that Hardy
said to him with interest What ails you sir

Forgive me replied Rodin with a bitter smile Thanks to the
ghostly counsels of the angelic Abbe Gabriel I have reached a sort of
resignation Still there are certain memories which affect me with the
most acute pain I told you resumed Rodin in a firmer voice or was
going to tell you that the very day after that on which I informed you
of the treachery practised against you I was myself the victim of a
frightful deception An adopted sona poor unfortunate child whom
I had brought up He paused again drew his trembling hand over his
eyes and added Pardon me sir for speaking of matters which must
be indifferent to you Excuse the intrusive sorrow of a poor broken
hearted old man

I have suffered too much myself sir to be indifferent to any kind of
sorrow replied Hardy Besides you are no stranger to mefor you
did me a real serviceand we both agree in our veneration for the same
young priest

The Abbe Gabriel cried Rodin interrupting Hardy ah sir he is my
deliverer my benefactor If you knew all his care and devotion during
my long illness caused by intense griefif you knew the ineffable
sweetness of his counsels

I know them sir cried Hardy oh yes I know how salutary is the
influence

In his mouth sir the precepts of religion are full of mildness
resumed Rodin with excitement Do they not heal and console do they
not make us love and hope instead of fear and tremble

Alas sir in this very house said Hardy I have been able to make
the comparison

I was happy enough said Rodin to have the angelic Abbe Gabriel for
my confessor or rather my confidant

Yes replied Hardy for he prefers confidence to confession

How well you know him said Rodin in a tone of the utmost simplicity
Then he resumed He is not a man but an angel His words would convert
the most hardened sinner Without being exactly impious I had myself
lived in the profession of what is called Natural Religion but the
angelic Abbe Gabriel has by degrees fixed my wavering belief given it
body and soul and in fact endowed me with faith

Yes he is a truly Christian priesta priest of love and pardon
cried Hardy

What you say is perfectly true replied Rodin for I came here almost
mad with grief thinking only of the unhappy boy who had repaid my
paternal goodness with the most monstrous ingratitude and sometimes I
yielded to violent bursts of despair and sometimes sank into a state
of mournful dejection cold as the grave itself But suddenly the
Abbe Gabriel appearedand the darkness fled before the dawning of a new
day

You were right sir there are strange coincidences said Hardy
yielding more and more to the feeling of confidence and sympathy
produced by the resemblance of his real position to Rodins pretended
one And to speak frankly he added I am very glad I have seen you
before quitting this house Were I capable of falling back into fits of
cowardly weakness your example alone would prevent me Since I listen
to you I feel myself stronger in the noble path which the angelic Abbe
Gabriel has opened before me as you so well express it

The poor old man will not then regret having listened to the first
impulse of his heart which urged him to come to you said Robin with
a touching expression You will sometimes remember me in that world to
which you are returning

Be sure of it sir but allow me to ask one question You remain you
say in this house

What would you have me do There reigns here a calm repose and one is
not disturbed in ones prayers said Rodin in a very gentle tone You
see I have suffered so muchthe conduct of that unhappy youth was
so horriblehe plunged into such shocking excessesthat the wrath of
heaven must be kindled against him Now I am very old and it is only by
passing the few days that are left me in fervent prayer that I can hope
to disarm the just anger of the Lord Oh prayerprayer It was
the Abbe Gabriel who revealed to me all its power and sweetnessand
therewith the formidable duties it imposes

Its duties are indeed great and sacred answered Hardy with a pensive
air

Do you remember the life of Rancey said Rodin abruptly as he darted
a peculiar glance at Hardy

The founder of La Trappe said Hardy surprised at Rodins question
I remember hearing a very vague account some time ago of the motives
of his conversion

There is mark you no more striking an example of the power of prayer
and of the state of almost divine ecstasy to which it may lead a
religious soul In a few words I will relate to you this instructive
and tragic history Ranceybut I beg your pardon I fear I am
trespassing on your time

No no answered Hardy hastily You cannot think how interested I
am in what you tell me My interview with the Abbe Gabriel was abruptly
broken off and in listening to you I fancy that I hear the further
development of his views Go on I conjure you

With all my heart I only wish that the instruction which thanks
to our angelic priest I derived from the story of Rancey might be as
profitable to you as it was to me

This then also came from the Abbe Gabriel

He related to me this kind of parable in support of his exhortations
replied Rodin Oh sir do I not owe to the consoling words of that
young priest all that has strengthened and revived my poor old broken
heart

Then I shall listen to you with a double interest

Rancey was a man of the world resumed Rodin as he looked attentively
at Hardy a gentlemanyoung ardent handsome He loved a young lady
of high rank I cannot tell what impediments stood in the way of their
union But this love though successful was kept secret and every
evening Rancey visited his mistress by means of a private staircase It
was they say one of those passionate loves which men feel but once
in their lives The mystery even the sacrifice made by the unfortunate
girl who forgot every duty seemed to give new charms to this guilty
passion In the silence and darkness of secrecy these two lovers passed
two years of voluptuous delirium which amounted almost to ecstasy

At these words Hardy started For the first time of late his brow was
suffused with a deep blush his heart throbbed violently he remembered
that he too had once known the ardent intoxication of a guilty and
hidden love Though the day was closing rapidly Rodin cast a sidelong
glance at Hardy and perceived the impression he had made Some
times he continued thinking of the dangers to which his mistress
was exposed if their connection should be discovered Rancey wished to
sever these delicious ties but the girl beside herself with passion
threw herself on the neck of her lover and threatened him in the
language of intense excitement to reveal and to brave all if he
thought of leaving her Too weak and loving to resist the prayers of his
mistress Rancey again and again yielded and they both gave themselves
up to a torrent of delight which carried them along forgetful of earth
and heaven

M Hardy listened to Rodin with feverish and devouring avidity The
Jesuit in painting with these almost sensual colors an ardent and
secret love revived in Hardy burning memories which till now had been
drowned in tears To the beneficent calm produced by the mild language
of Gabriel had succeeded a painful agitation which mingled with the
reaction of the shocks received that day began to throw his mind into a
strange state of confusion

Rodin having so far succeeded in his object continued as follows A
fatal day came at last Rancey obliged to go to the wars quitted the
girl but after a short campaign he returned more in love than ever
He had written privately to say he would arrive almost immediately
after his letter He came accordingly It was night He ascended as
usual the private staircase which led to the chamber of his mistress
he entered the room his heart beating with love and hope His mistress
had died that morning

Ah cried Hardy covering his face with his hands in terror

She was dead resumed Rodin Two waxcandles were burning beside the
funeral couch Rancey could not would not believe that she was dead
He threw himself on his knees by the corpse In his delirium he seized
that fair beloved head to cover it with kisses The head parted from
the body and remained in his hands Yes resumed Rodin as Hardy drew
back pale and mute with terror yes the girl had fallen a victim
to so swift and extraordinary a disease that she had not been able to
receive the last sacraments After her death the doctors in the hope
of discovering the cause of this unknown malady had begun to dissect
that fair form

As Rodin reached this part of his narrative night was almost come
A sort of hazy twilight alone reigned in this silent chamber in the
centre of which appeared the pale and ghastly form of Rodin clad in his
long black gown whilst his eyes seemed to sparkle with diabolic fire
Overcome by the violent emotions occasioned by this story in which
thoughts of death and voluptuousness love and horror were so strangely
mingled Hardy remained fixed and motionless waiting for the words of
Rodin with a combination of curiosity anguish and alarm

And Rancey said he at last in an agitated voice whilst he wiped
the cold sweat from his brow

After two days of furious delirium resumed Rodin he renounced the
world and shut himself up in impenetrable solitude The first period
of his retreat was frightful in his despair he uttered loud yells of
grief and rage that were audible at some distance Twice he attempted
suicide to escape from the terrible visions

He had visions then said Hardy with an increased agony of
curiosity

Yes replied Rodin in a solemn tone he had fearful visions He saw
the girl who for his sake had died in mortal sin plunged in the
heat of the everlasting flames of hell On that fair face disfigured by
infernal tortures was stamped the despairing laugh of the damned Her
teeth gnashed with pain her arms writhed in anguish She wept tears
of blood and with an agonized and avenging voice she cried to her
seducer Thou art the cause of my perditionmy curse my curse be upon
thee

As he pronounced these last words Rodin advanced three steps nearer to
Hardy accompanying each step with a menacing gesture If we remember
the state of weakness trouble and fear in which M Hardy wasif we
remember that the Jesuit had just roused in the soul of this unfortunate
man all the sensual and spiritual memories of a love cooled but not
extinguished in tearsif we remember too that Hardy reproached
himself with the seduction of a beloved object whom her departure from
her duties might according to the Catholic faith doom to
everlasting flameswe shall not wonder at the terrible effect of this
phantasmagoria conjured up in silence and solitude in the evening
dusk by this fearful priest

The effect on Hardy was indeed striking and the more dangerous that
the Jesuit with diabolical craft seemed only to be carrying out from
another point of view the ideas of Gabriel Had not the young
priest convinced Hardy that nothing is sweeter than to ask of heaven
forgiveness for those who have sinned or whom we have led astray But
forgiveness implies punishment and it was to the punishment alone that
Rodin drew the attention of his victim by painting it in these terrible
hues With hands clasped together and eye fixed and dilated Hardy
trembled in all his limbs and seemed still listening to Rodin though
the latter had ceased to speak Mechanically he repeated My curse my
curse be upon thee

Then suddenly he exclaimed in a kind of frenzy The curse is on me
also The woman whom I taught to forget her sacred duties and to
commit mortal sinone day plunged in the everlasting flamesher arms
writhing in agonyweeping tears of bloodwill cry to me from the
bottomless pit My curse my curse be upon theeOne day he
added with redoubled terror one daywho knows perhaps at
this momentfor if the sea voyage had been fatal to herif a
shipwreckoh God she too would have died in mortal sinlost lost
foreverOh have mercy on her my God Crush me in Thy wrathbut have
mercy on herfor I alone am guilty

And the unfortunate man almost delirious sank with clasped hands upon
the ground

Sir cried Rodin in an affectionate voice as he hastened to lift him
up my dear sirmy dear friendbe calm Comfort yourself I cannot
bear to see you despond Alas my intention was quite the contrary to
that

The curse the curse yes she will curse me alsoshe that I loved
so muchin the everlasting flames murmured Hardy shuddering and
apparently insensible to the others words

But my dear sir listen to me I entreat you resumed the latter
let me finish my story and then you will find it as consoling as it
now seems terrible For heavens sake remember the adorable words of
our angelic Abbe Gabriel with regard to the sweetness of prayer

At the name of Gabriel Hardy recovered himself a little and exclaimed
in a heartrending tone Ay his words were sweet and beneficent Where
are they now For mercys sake repeat to me those consoling words

Our angelic Abbe Gabriel resumed Rodin spoke to you of the
sweetness of prayer

Oh yes prayer

Well my dear sir listen to me and you shall see how prayer saved
Rancey and made a saint of him Yes these frightful torments that I
have just described these threatening visions were all conquered by
prayer and changed into celestial delights

I beg of you said Hardy in a faint voice speak to me of Gabriel
speak to me of heavenbut no more flamesno more hellwhere sinful
women weep tears of blood

No no replied Rodin and even as in describing hell his tone had
been harsh and threatening it now became warm and tender as he uttered
the following words No we will have no more images of despairfor
as I have told you after suffering infernal tortures Rancey thanks to
the power of prayer enjoyed the delights of paradise

The delights of paradise repeated Hardy listening with anxious
attention

One day at the height of his grief a priest a good priestanother
Abbe Gabrielcame to Rancey Oh happiness oh providential change In
a few days he taught the sufferer the sacred mysteries of prayerthat
pious intercession of the creature addressed to the Creator in
favor of a soul exposed to the wrath of heaven Then Rancey seemed
transformed His grief was at once appeased He prayed and the more
he prayed the greater was his hope He felt that God listened to his
prayer Instead of trying to forget his beloved he now thought of her
constantly and prayed for her salvation Happy in his obscure cell
alone with that adored remembrance he passed days and nights in praying
for herplunged in an ineffable burning I had almost said amorous
ecstasy

It is impossible to give an idea of the tone of almost sensual energy
with which Rodin pronounced the word amorous Hardy started changing
from hot to cold For the first time his weakened mind caught a glimpse
of the fatal pleasures of asceticism and of that deplorable catalepsy
described in the lives of St Theresa St Aubierge and others

Rodin perceived the others thoughts and continued Oh Rancey was not
now the man to content himself with a vague passing prayer uttered in
the whirl of the worlds business which swallows it up and prevents
it from reaching the ear of heaven No no in the depth of solitude he
endeavored to make his prayers even more efficacious so ardently did he
desire the eternal salvation of his mistress

What did he do thenoh what did he do in his solitude cried Hardy
who was now powerless in the hands of the Jesuit

First of all said Rodin with a slight emphasis he became a monk

A monk repeated Hardy with a pensive air

Yes resumed Rodin he became a monk because his prayers were thus
more likely to be favorably accepted And then as in solitude our
thoughts are apt to wander he fasted and mortified his flesh and
brought into subjection all that was carnal within him so that
becoming all spirit his prayers might issue like a pure flame from his
bosom and ascend like the perfume of incense to the throne of the Most
High

Oh what a delicious dream cried Hardy more and more under the
influence of the spell to pray for the woman we have adored and to
become spiritperfumelight

Yes spirit perfume light said Rodin with emphasis But it is no
dream How many monks how many hermits like Rancey have by prayers
and austerity and macerations attained a divine ecstasy and if you
only knew the celestial pleasures of such ecstasiesThus after he
became a monk the terrible dreams were succeeded by enchanting visions
Many times after a day of fasting and a night passed in prayers and
macerations Rancey sank down exhausted on the floor of his cell Then
the spirit freed itself from the vile clogs of matter His senses were
absorbed in pleasure the sound of heavenly harmony struck upon his
ravished car a bright mild light which was not of this world
dawned upon his halfclosed eyes and at the height of the melodious
vibrations of the golden harps of the Seraphim in the centre of a
glory compared to which the sun is pale the monk beheld the image of
that beloved woman

Whom by his prayers he had at length rescued from the eternal flames
said Hardy in a trembling voice

Yes herself replied Rodin with eloquent enthusiasm for this
monster was skilled in every style of speech Thanks to the prayers of
her lover which the Lord had granted this woman no longer shed tears
of bloodno longer writhed her beautiful arms in the convulsions of
infernal anguish No no still fairoh a thousand times fairer than
when she dwelt on earthfair with the everlasting beauty of angelsshe
smiled on her lover with ineffable ardor and her eyes beaming with a
mild radiance she said to him in a tender and passionate voice Glory
to the Lord glory to thee O my beloved Thy prayers and austerities
have saved me I am numbered amongst the chosen Thanks my beloved and
gloryAnd therewith radiant in her felicity she stooped to
kiss with lips fragrant with immortality the lips of the enraptured
monkand their souls mingled in that kiss burning as love chaste as
divine grace immense as eternity

Oh cried Hardy completely beside himself a whole life of prayer
fasting torture for such a momentwith her whom I mournwith her
whom I have perhaps led to perdition

What do you say such a moment cried Rodin whose yellow forehead was
bathed in sweat like that of a magnetizer and who now took Hardy by
the hand and drew still closer as if to breathe into him the burning
delirium it was not once in his religious lifeit was almost every
day that Rancey plunged in divine ecstasy enjoyed these delicious
ineffable superhuman pleasures which are to the pleasures of earth
what eternity is to mans existence

Seeing no doubt that Hardy was now at the point to which he wished to
bring him and the night being almost entirely come the reverend father
coughed two or three times in a significant manner and looked towards
the door At this moment Hardy in the height of his frenzy exclaimed
with a supplicating voice A cella tomband the Ecstatic Vision

The door of the room opened and Father dAigrigny entered with a cloak
under his arm A servant followed him bearing a light

About ten minutes after this scene a dozen robust men with frank
open countenances led by Agricola entered the Rue de Vaugirard and
advanced joyously towards the house of the reverend fathers It was a
deputation from the former workmen of M Hardy They came to escort him
and to congratulate him on his return amongst them Agricola walked at
their head Suddenly he saw a carriage with posthorses issuing from
the gateway of the house The postilion whipped up the horses and
they started at full gallop Was it chance or instinct The nearer the
carriage approached the group of which he formed a part the more did
Agricolas heart sink within him

The impression became so vivid that it was soon changed into a terrible
apprehension and at the moment when the vehicle which had its blinds
down was about to pass close by him the smith in obedience to a
resistless impulse exclaimed as he rushed to the horses heads Help
friends stop them

Postilion ten louis if you ride over him cried from the carriage the
military voice of Father dAigrigny

The cholera was still raging The postilion had heard of the murder of
the poisoners Already frightened at the sudden attack of Agricola
he struck him a heavy blow on the head with the butt of his whip which
stretched him senseless on the ground Then spurring with all his
might he urged his three horses into a triple gallop and the carriage
rapidly disappeared whilst Agricolas companions who had neither
understood his actions nor the sense of his words crowded around the
smith and did their best to revive him




CHAPTER XLIV REMEMBRANCES

Other events took place a few days after the fatal evening in which M
Hardy fascinated and misled by the deplorable mystic jargon of Rodin
had implored Father dAigrigny on his knees to remove him far from
Paris into some deep solitude where he might devote himself to a life
of prayer and ascetic austerities Marshal Simon since his arrival
in Paris had occupied with his two daughters a house in the Rue des
TroisFreres Before introducing the reader into this modest dwelling
we are obliged to recall to his memory some preceding facts The day of
the burning of Hardy s factory Marshal Simon had come to consult with
his father on a question of the highest importance and to communicate
to him his painful apprehensions on the subject of the growing sadness
of his twin daughters which he was unable to explain

Marshal Simon held in religious reverence the memory of the Great
Emperor His gratitude to the hero was boundless his devotion blind
his enthusiasm founded upon reason his affection warm as the most
sincere and passionate friendship But this was not all

One day the emperor in a burst of joy and paternal tenderness had led
the marshal to the cradle of the sleeping King of Rome and said to him
as he proudly pointed to the beautiful child My old friend swear to
me that you will serve the son as you have served the father

Marshal Simon took and kept that vow During the Restoration the chief
of a military conspiracy in favor of Napoleon II he had attempted
in vain to secure a regiment of cavalry at that time commanded by
the Marquis dAigrigny Betrayed and denounced the marshal after a
desperate duel with the future Jesuit had succeeded in reaching Poland
and thus escaping a sentence of death It is useless to repeat the
series of events which led the marshal from Poland to India and then
brought him back to Paris after the Revolution of Julyan epoch at
which a number of his old comrades in arms had solicited and obtained
from the government without his knowledge the confirmation of the rank
and title which the emperor had bestowed upon him just before Waterloo

On his return to Paris after his long exile in spite of all the
happiness he felt in at length embracing his children Marshal Simon was
deeply affected on learning the death of their mother whom he
adored Till the last moment he had hoped to find her in Paris The
disappointment was dreadful and he felt it cruelly though he sought
consolation in his childrens affection

But soon new causes of trouble and anxiety were interwoven with his
life by the machinations of Rodin Thanks to the secret intrigues of the
reverend father at the Courts of Rome and Vienna one of his emissaries
in a condition to inspire full confidence and provided with undeniable
evidence to support his words went to Marshal Simon and said to him
The son of the emperor is dying the victim of the fears with which the
name of Napoleon still inspires Europe

From this slow expiring you Marshal Simon one of the emperors most
faithful friends are able to rescue this unfortunate prince

The correspondence in my hand proves that it would be easy to open
relations of the surest and most secret nature with one of the most
influential persons about the King of Rome and this person would be
disposed to favor the princes escape

It is possible by a bold unexpected stroke to deliver Napoleon II
from the custody of Austria which would leave him to perish by inches
in an atmosphere that is fatal to him

The enterprise may be a rash one but it has chances of success that
you Marshal Simon more than any other could change into certainties
for your devotion to the emperor is well known and we remember with
what adventurous audacity you conspired in 1815 in favor of Napoleon
II

The state of languor and decline of the King of Rome was then in France
a matter of public notoriety People even went so far as to affirm that
the son of the hero was carefully trained by priests who kept him in
complete ignorance of the glory of his paternal name and that by the
most execrable machinations they strove day by day to extinguish every
noble and generous instinct that displayed itself in the unfortunate
youth The coldest hearts were touched and softened at the story of
so sad and fatal a destiny When we remember the heroic character and
chivalrous loyalty of Marshal Simon and his passionate devotion to the
emperor we can understand how the father of Rose and Blanche was more
interested than any one else in the fate of the young prince and how
if occasion offered he would feel himself obliged not to confine
his efforts to mere regrets With regard to the reality of the
correspondence produced by Rodins emissary it had been submitted by
the marshal to a searching test by means of his intimacy with one of
his old companions in arms who had been for a long period on a mission
to Vienna in the time of the empire The result of this investigation
conducted with as much prudence as address so that nothing should
transpire showed that the marshal might give his serious attention to
the advances made him

Hence this proposition threw the father of Rose and Blanche into a
cruel perplexity for to attempt so bold and dangerous an enterprise
he must once more abandon his children whilst on the contrary if
alarmed at this separation he renounced the endeavor to save the
King of Rome whose lingering death was perfectly true and well
authenticated the marshal would consider himself as false to the vow
he had sworn to the emperor To end these painful hesitations full of
confidence in the inflexible uprightness of his fathers character the
marshal had gone to ask his advice unfortunately the old republican
workman mortally wounded during the attack on M Hardys factory but
still pondering over the serious communication of his son died with
these words upon his Lips My son you have a great duty to perform
under pain of not acting like a man of honor and of disobeying my last
will You must without hesitation

But by a deplorable fatality the last words which would have
completed the sense of the old workmans thought were spoken in so
feeble a voice as to be quite unintelligible He died leaving Marshal
Simon in a worse state of anxiety as one of the two courses open to him
had now been formally condemned by his father in whose judgment he had
the most implicit and merited confidence In a word his mind was now
tortured by the doubt whether his father had intended in the name of
honor and duty to advise him not to abandon his children to engage in
so hazardous an enterprise or whether on the contrary he had wished
him to leave them for a time to perform the vow made to the emperor
and endeavor at least to rescue Napoleon II from a captivity that might
soon be mortal

This perplexity rendered more cruel by certain circumstances to be
related hereafter the tragical death of his father who had expired
in his arms the incessant and painful remembrance of his wife who
had perished in a land of exile and finally the grief he felt at
perceiving the overgrowing sadness of Rose and Blanche occasioned
severe shocks to Marshal Simon Let us add that in spite of his natural
intrepidity so nobly proved by twenty years of war the ravages of the
cholera the same terrible malady to which his wife had fallen a victim
in Siberia filled the marshal with involuntary dread Yes this man of
iron nerves who had coolly braved death in so many battles felt the
habitual firmness of his character give way at sight of the scenes of
desolation and mourning which Paris offered at every step Yet when
Mdlle de Cardoville gathered round her the members of her family to
warn them against the plot of their enemies the affectionate tenderness
of Adrienne for Rose and Blanche appeared to exercise so happy an
influence on their mysterious sorrow that the marshal forgetting for a
moment his fatal regrets thought only of enjoying this blessed change
which alas was but of short duration Having now recalled these facts
to the mind of the reader we shall continue our story




CHAPTER XLV THE BLOCKHEAD

We have stated that Marshal Simon occupied a small house in the Rue
des TroisFreres Two oclock in the afternoon had just struck in the
marshals sleepingchamber a room furnished with military simplicity
In the recess in which stood the bed hung a trophy composed of the
arms used by the marshal during his campaigns On the secretary opposite
was a small bronze bust of the emperor the only ornament of the
apartment Out of doors the temperature was far from warm and the
marshal had become susceptible to cold during his long residence in
India A good fire therefore blazed upon the hearth A door concealed
by the hangings and leading to a back staircase opened slowly and
a man entered the chamber He carried a basket of wood and advanced
leisurely to the fireplace before which he knelt clown and began to
arrange the logs symmetrically in a box that stood besides the hearth
After some minutes occupied in this manner still kneeling he gradually
approached another door at a little distance from the chimney and
appeared to listen with deep attention as if he wished to hear what was
passing in the next room

This man employed as an inferior servant in the house had the most
ridiculously stupid look that can be imagined His functions consisted
in carrying wood running errands etc In other respects he was a kind
of laughingstock to the other servants In a moment of good humor
Dagobert who filled the post of majordomo had given this idiot the
name of Loony lunatic which he had retained ever since and which
he deserved in every respect as well for his awkwardness and folly as
for his unmeaning face with its grotesquely flat nose sloping chin
and wide staring eyes Add to this description a jacket of red stuff
and a triangular white apron and we must acknowledge that the simpleton
was quite worthy of his name

Yet at the moment when Loony listened so attentively at the door of the
adjoining room a ray of quick intelligence animated for an instant his
dull and stupid countenance

When he had thus listened for a short time Loony returned to the
fireplace still crawling on his knees then rising he again took his
basket half full of wood and once more approaching the door at which
he had listened knocked discreetly No one answered He knocked a second
time and more loudly Still there was the same silence

Then he said in a harsh squeaking laughable voice Ladies do you
want any wood if you please for your fire

Receiving no answer Loony placed his basket on the ground opened the
door gently and entered the next room after casting a rapid glance
around He came out again in a few seconds looking from side to side
with an anxious air like a man who had just accomplished some important
and mysterious task

Taking up his basket he was about to leave Marshal Simons room when
the door of the private staircase was opened slowly and with precaution
and Dagobert appeared

The soldier evidently surprised at the servants presence knitted his
brows and exclaimed abruptly What are you doing here

At this sudden interrogation accompanied by a growl expressive of the
illhumor of Spoilsport who followed close on his masters heels
Loony uttered a cry of real or pretended terror To give perhaps an
appearance of greater reality to his dread the supposed simpleton let
his basket fall on the ground as if astonishment and fear had loosened
his hold of it

What are you doing numbskull resumed Dagobert whose countenance was
impressed with deep sadness and who seemed little disposed to laugh at
the fellows stupidity

Oh M Dagobert how you frighten me Dear me what a pity I had not an
armful of plates to prove it was not my fault if I broke them all

I ask what you are doing resumed the soldier

You see M Dagobert replied Loony pointing to his basket that I
came with some wood to masters room so that he might burn it if it
was coldwhich it is

Very well Pick up your wood and begone

Oh M Dagobert my legs tremble under me How you did scare me to be
sure

Will you begone brute resumed the veteran and seizing Loony by the
arm he pushed him towards the door while Spoilsport with recumbent
ears and hair standing up like the quills of a porcupine seemed
inclined to accelerate his retreat

I am going M Dagobert I am going replied the simpleton as he
hastily gathered up his basket only please to tell the dog

Go to the devil you stupid chatterbox cried Dagobert as he pushed
Loony through the doorway

Then the soldier bolted the door which led to the private staircase and
going to that which communicated with the apartments of the two sisters
he doublelocked it Having done this he hastened to the alcove
in which stood the bed and taking down a pair of loaded pistols he
carefully removed the percussion caps and unable to repress a deep
sigh restored the weapons to the place in which he had found them
Then as if on second thoughts he took down an Indian dagger with a
very sharp blade and drawing it from its silvergilt sheath proceeded
to break the point of this murderous instrument by twisting it beneath
one of the iron castors of the bed

Dagobert then proceeded to unfasten the two doors and returning slowly
to the marble chimneypiece he leaned against it with a gloomy and
pensive air Crouching before the fire Spoilsport followed with an
attentive eye the least movement of his master The good dog displayed
a rare and intelligent sagacity The soldier having drawn out his
handkerchief let fall without perceiving it a paper containing a roll
of tobacco Spoilsport who had all the qualities of a retriever of
the Rutland race took the paper between his teeth and rising upon
his hindlegs presented it respectfully to Dagobert But the latter
received it mechanically and appeared indifferent to the dexterity of
his dog The grenadiers countenance revealed as much sorrow as
anxiety After remaining for some minutes near the fire with fixed and
meditative look he began to walk about the room in great agitation one
of his hands thrust into the bosom of his long blue frockcoat which
was buttoned up to the chin and the other into one of his hindpockets

From time to time he stopped abruptly and seemed to make reply to his
own thoughts or uttered an exclamation of doubt and uneasiness then
turning towards the trophy of arms he shook his head mournfully
and murmured No matterthis fear may be idle but he has acted so
extraordinarily these two days that it is at all events more prudent

He continued his walk and said after a new and prolonged silence Yes
he must tell me It makes me too uneasy And then the poor childrenit
is enough to break ones heart

And Dagobert hastily drew his moustache between his thumb and
forefinger a nervous movement which with him was an evident symptom
of extreme agitation Some minutes after the soldier resumed still
answering his inward thoughts What can it be It is hardly possible to
be the letters they are too infamous he despises them And yet But no
nohe is above that

And Dagobert again began to walk with hasty steps Suddenly Spoilsport
pricked up his ears turned his head in the direction of the staircase
door and growled hoarsely A few seconds after some one knocked at the
door

Who is there said Dagobert There was no answer but the person
knocked again Losing patience the soldier went hastily to open it and
saw the servants stupid face

Why dont you answer when I ask who knocks said the soldier
angrily

M Dagobert you sent me away just now and I was afraid of making you
cross if I said I had come again

What do you want Speak thencome in stupid cried the exasperated
Dagobert as he pulled him into the room

M Dagobert dont be angryIll tell you all about itit is a young
man

Well

He wants to speak to you directly Mr Dagobert

His name

His name M Dagobert replied Loony rolling about and laughing with
an idiotic air

Yes his name Speak idiot

Oh M Dagobert its all in joke that you ask me his name

You are determined fool that you are to drive me out of my senses
cried the soldier seizing Loony by the collar The name of this young
man

Dont be angry M Dagobert I didnt tell you the name because you
know it

Beast said Dagobert shaking his fist at him

Yes you do know it M Dagobert for the young man is your own son He
is downstairs and wants to speak to you directlyyes directly

The stupidity was so well assumed that Dagobert was the dupe of it
Moved to compassion rather than anger by such imbecility he looked
fixedly at the servant shrugged his shoulders and said as he advanced
towards the staircase Follow me

Loony obeyed but before closing the door he drew a letter secretly
from his pocket and dropped it behind him without turning his head
saying all the while to Dagobert for the purpose of occupying his
attention Your son is in the court M Dagobert He would not come
upthats why he is still downstairs

Thus talking he closed the door believing he had left the letter
on the floor of Marshal Simons room But he had reckoned without
Spoilsport Whether he thought it more prudent to bring up the rear
or from respectful deference for a biped the worthy dog had been the
last to leave the room and being a famous carrier as soon as he saw
the letter dropped by Loony he took it delicately between his teeth
and followed close on the heels of the servant without the latter
perceiving this new proof of the intelligence and sagacity of
Spoilsport




CHAPTER XLVI THE ANONYMOUS LETTERS

We will explain presently what became of the letter which Spoilsport
held between his teeth and why he left his master when the latter ran
to meet Agricola Dagobert had not seen his son for some days Embracing
him cordially he led him into one of the rooms on the ground floor
which he usually occupied And how is your wife said the soldier to
his son

She is well father thank you

Perceiving a great change in Agricolas countenance Dagobert resumed
You look sad Has anything gone wrong since I saw you last

All is over father We have lost him said the smith in a tone of
despair

Lost whom

M Hardy

M Hardywhy three days ago you told me you were going to see him

Yes father I have seen himand my dear brother Gabriel saw him
and spoke to himhow he speaks with a voice that comes from the
heartand he had so revived and encouraged him that M Hardy
consented to return amongst us Then I wild with joy ran to tell the
good news to some of my mates who were waiting to hear the result of
nay interview with M Hardy I brought them all with me to thank and
bless him We were within a hundred yards of the house belonging to the
blackgowns

Ali the blackgowns said Dagobert with a gloomy air Then some
mischief will happen I know them

You are not mistaken father answered Agricola with a sigh I was
running on with my comrades when I saw a carriage coming towards us
Some presentiment told me that they were taking away M Hardy

By force said Dagobert hastily

No answered Agricola bitterly nothe priests are too cunning for
that They know how to make you an accomplice in the evil they do you
Shall I not always remember how they managed with my good mother

Yes the worthy woman there was a poor fly caught in the spiders web
But this carriage of which you speak

On seeing it start from the house of the blackgowns replied
Agricola my heart sank within me and by an impulse stronger than
myself I rushed to the horses heads calling on my comrades to help
me But the postilion knocked me down and stunned me with a blow from
his whip When I recovered my senses the carriage was already far
away

You were not hurt cried Dagobert anxiously as he examined his son
from top to toe

No father a mere scratch

What did you next my boy

I hastened to our good angel Mdlle de Cardoville and told her all
You must follow M Hardy on the instant said she to me Take my
carriage and posthorses Dupont will accompany you follow M Hardy
from stage to stage should you succeed in overtaking him your presence
and your prayers may perhaps conquer the fatal influence that these
priests have acquired over him

It was the best advice she could give you That excellent young lady is
always right

An hour after we were upon our way for we learned by the returned
postilions that M Hardy had taken the Orleans road We followed him as
far as Etampes There we heard that he had taken a crossroad to reach
a solitary house in a valley about four leagues from the highway They
told us that this house called the ValdeSt Herem belonged to certain
priests and that as the night was so dark and the road so bad we
had better sleep at the inn and start early in the morning We followed
this advice and set out at dawn In a quarter of an hour we quitted
the highroad for a mountainous and desert track We saw nothing but
brown rocks and a few birch trees As we advanced the scene became
wilder and wilder We might have fancied ourselves a hundred leagues
from Paris At last we stopped in front of a large old blacklooking
house with only a few small windows in it and built at the foot of a
high rocky mountain In my whole life I have never seen anything so
deserted and sad We got out of the carriage and I rang the bell A
man opened the door Did not the Abbe dAigrigny arrive here last night
with a gentleman said I to this man with a confidential air Inform
the gentleman directly that I come on business of importance and that
I must see him forthwithThe man believing me an accomplice showed
us in immediately a moment after the Abbe dAigrigny opened the door
saw me and drew back yet in five minutes more I was in presence of
M Hardy

Well said Dagobert with interest

Agricola shook his head sorrowfully and replied I knew by the very
countenance of M Hardy that all was over Addressing me in a mild but
firm voice he said to me I understand I can even excuse the motives
that bring you hither But I am quite determined to live henceforth
in solitude and prayer I take this resolution freely and voluntarily
because I would fain provide for the salvation of my soul Tell your
fellows that my arrangements will be such as to leave them a good
remembrance of meAnd as I was about to speak M Hardy interrupted
me saying It is useless my friend My determination is unalterable
Do not write to me for your letters would remain unanswered Prayer
will henceforth be my only occupation Excuse me for leaving you but I
am fatigued from my journeyHe spoke the truth for he was as pale as
a spectre with a kind of wildness about the eyes and so changed since
the day before as to be hardly the same man His hand when he offered
it on parting from me was dry and burning The Abbe dAigrigny soon
came in Father said M Hardy to him have the goodness to see M
Baudoin to the doorSo saying he waved his hand to me in token of
farewell and retired to the next chamber All was over he is lost to
us forever

Yes said Dagobert those blackgowns have enchanted him like so
many others

In despair resumed Agricola I returned hither with M Dupont This
then is what the priests have made of M Hardyof that generous man
who supported nearly three hundred industrious workmen in order and
happiness increasing their knowledge improving their hearts and
earning the benediction of that little people of which he was the
providence Instead of all this M Hardy is now forever reduced to a
gloomy and unavailing life of contemplation

Oh the blackgowns said Dagobert shuddering and unable to conceal
a vague sense of fear The longer I live the more I am afraid of them
You have seen what those people did to your poor mother you see what
they have just done to M Hardy you know their plots against my two
poor orphans and against that generous young lady Oh these people are
very powerful I would rather face a battalion of Russian grenadiers
than a dozen of these cassocks But dont lets talk of it I have
causes enough beside for grief and fear

Then seeing the astonished look of Agricola the soldier unable to
restrain his emotion threw himself into the arms of his son exclaiming
with a choking voice I can hold out no longer My heart is too full I
must speak and whom shall I trust if not you

Father you frighten me said Agricola What is the matter

Why you see had it not been for you and the two poor girls I should
have blown out my brains twenty times over rather than see what I
seeand dread what I do

What do you dread father

Since the last few days I do not know what has come over the
marshalbut he frightens me

Yet in his last interviews with Mdlle de Cardoville

Yes he was a little better By her kind words this generous young
lady poured balm into his wounds the presence of the young Indian
cheered him he appeared to shake off his cares and his poor little
girls felt the benefit of the change But for some days I know not what
demon has been loosed against his family It is enough to turn ones
head First of all I am sure that the anonymous letters have begun
again

What letters father

The anonymous letters

But what are they about

You know how the marshal hated that renegade the Abbe dAigrigny When
he found that the traitor was here and that he had persecuted the two
orphans even as he persecuted their mother to the deathbut that now
he had become a priestI thought the marshal would have gone mad with
indignation and fury He wishes to go in search of the renegade With
one word I calmed him He is a priest I said you may do what you
will insult or strike himhe will not fight He began by serving
against his country he ends by becoming a bad priest It is all in
character He is not worth spitting uponBut surely I may punish the
wrong done to my children and avenge the death of my wife cried the
marshal much exasperatedThey say as you well know that there are
courts of law to avenge your wrongs answered I Mdlle de Cardoville
has lodged a charge against the renegade for having attempted to
confine your daughters in a convent We must champ the bit and wait

Yes said Agricola mournfully and unfortunately there lacks proof
to bring it home to the Abbe dAigrigny The other day when I was
examined by Mdlle de Cardovilles lawyer with regard to our attempt
on the convent he told me that we should meet with obstacles at every
step for want of legal evidence and that the priests had taken their
precautions with so much skill that the indictment would be quashed

That is just what the marshal thinks my boy and this increases his
irritation at such injustice

He should despise the wretches

But the anonymous letters

Well what of them father

You shall know all A brave and honorable man like the marshal when
his first movement of indignation was over felt that to insult the
renegade disguised in the garb of a priest would be like insulting
an old man or a woman He determined therefore to despise him and to
forget him as soon as possible But then almost every day there
came by the post anonymous letters in which all sorts of devices were
employed to revive and excite the anger of the marshal against
the renegade by reminding him of all the evil contrived by the Abbe
dAigrigny against him and his family The marshal was reproached with
cowardice for not taking vengeance on this priest the persecutor of his
wife and children the insolent mocker at his misfortunes

And from whom do you suspect these letters to come father

I cannot tellit is that which turns ones brain They must come from
the enemies of the marshal and he has no enemies but the blackgowns

But father since these letters are to excite his anger against the
Abbe dAigrigny they can hardly have been written by priests

That is what I have said to myself

But what then can be their object

Their object oh it is too plain cried Dagobert The marshal is
hasty ardent he has a thousand reasons to desire vengeance on the
renegade But he cannot do himself justice and the other sort of
justice fails him Then what does he do He endeavors to forget he
forgets But every day there comes to him an insolent letter to provoke
and exasperate his legitimate hatred by mockeries and insults Devil
take me my head is not the weakestbut at such a game I should go
mad

Father such a plot would be horrible and only worthy of hell

And that is not all

What more

The marshal has received other letters those he has not shown mebut
after he had read the first he remained like a man struck motionless
and murmured to himself They do not even respect thatoh it is too
muchtoo muchAnd hiding his face in his hands he wept

The marshal wept cried the blacksmith hardly able to believe what he
heard

Yes answered Dagobert he wept like a child

And what could these letters contain father

I did not venture to ask him he appeared so miserable and dejected

But thus harassed and tormented incessantly the marshal must lead a
wretched life

And his poor little girls too he sees them grow sadder and sadder
without being able to guess the cause And the death of his father
killed almost in his arms Perhaps you will think all this enough but
no I am sure there is something still more painful behind Lately you
would hardly know the marshal He is irritable about nothing and falls
into such fits of passion that After a moments hesitation the
soldier resumed I way tell this to you my poor boy I have just been
upstairs to take the caps from his pistols

What father cried Agricola you fear

In the state of exasperation in which I saw him yesterday there is
everything to fear

What then happened

Since some time he has often long secret interviews with a gentleman
who looks like an old soldier and a worthy man I have remarked that
the gloom and agitation of the marshal are always redoubled after one of
these visits Two or three times I have spoken to him about it but I
saw by his look that I displeased him and therefore I desisted

Well yesterday this gentleman came in the evening He remained here
until eleven oclock and his wife came to fetch him and waited for him
in a coach After his departure I went up to see if the marshal wanted
anything He was very pale but calm he thanked me and I came down
again You know that my room is just under his I could hear the marshal
walking about as if much agitated and soon after he seemed to be
knocking down the furniture In alarm I once more went upstairs He
asked me with an irritated air what I wanted and ordered me to leave
the room Seeing him in that way I remained he grew more angry still
I remained perceiving a chair and table thrown down I pointed to them
with so sad an air that he understood me You know that he has the best
heart in the world so taking me by the hand he said to me Forgive
me for causing you this uneasiness my good Dagobert but just now I
lost my senses and gave way to a burst of absurd fury I think I should
have thrown myself out of the window had it been open I only hope
that my poor dear girls have not heard me added he as he went on
tiptoe to open the door which communicates with his daughters bedroom
When he had listened anxiously for a moment he returned to me and
said Luckily they are asleepThen I asked him what was the cause
of his agitation and if in spite of my precautions he had received
any more anonymous letters No replied he with a gloomy air but
leave me my friend I am now better It has done me good to see you
Goodnight old comrade go downstairs to bedI took care not to
contradict him but pretending to go down I came up again and seated
myself on the top stair listening No doubt to calm himself entirely
the marshal went to embrace his children for I heard him open and shut
their door Then he returned to his room and walked about for a long
time but with a more quiet step At last I heard him throw himself on
his bed and I came down about break of day After that all remained
tranquil

But whatever can be the matter with him father

I do not know When I went up to him I was astonished at the agitation
of his countenance and the brilliancy of his eyes He would have looked
much the same had he been delirious or in a burning feverso that
when I heard him say he could have thrown himself out of the window
had it been open I thought it more prudent to remove the caps from his
pistols

I cannot understand it said Agricola So firm intrepid and cool a
man as the marshal a prey to such violence

I tell you that something very extraordinary is passing within him
For two days he has not been to see his children which is always a bad
sign with himto say nothing of the poor little angels themselves who
are miserable at the notion that they have displeased their father They
displease him If you only knew the life they lead dear creatures a
walk or ride with me and their companion for I never let them go
out alone and the rest of their time at their studies reading or
needleworkalways togetherand then to bed Yet their duenna who is
I think a worthy woman tells me that sometimes at night she has seen
them shed tears in their sleep Poor children they have hitherto known
but little happiness added the soldier with a sigh

At this moment hearing some one walk hastily across the courtyard
Dagobert raised his eyes and saw Marshal Simon with pale face and
bewildered air holding in his two hands a letter which he seemed to
read with devouring anxiety




CHAPTER XLVII THE GOLDEN CITY

While Marshal Simon was crossing the little court with so agitated
an air reading the anonymous letter which he had received by
Spoilsports unexpected medium Rose and Blanche were alone together
in the sitting room they usually occupied which had been entered for a
moment by Loony during their absence The poor children seemed destined
to a succession of sorrows At the moment their mourning for their
mother drew near its close the tragical death of their grandfather had
again dressed them in funereal weeds They were seated together upon a
couch in front of their worktable Grief often produces the effect of
years Hence in a few months Rose and Blanche had become quite young
women To the infantine grace of their charming faces formerly so plump
and rosy but now pale and thin had succeeded an expression of grave
and touching sadness Their large mild eyes of limpid azure which
always had a dreamy character were now never bathed in those joyous
tears with which a burst of frank and hearty laughter used of old to
adorn their silky lashes when the comic coolness of Dagobert or some
funny trick of Spoilsport cheered them in the course of their long and
weary pilgrimage

In a word those delightful faces which the flowery pencil of Greuze
could alone have painted in all their velvet freshness were now worthy
of inspiring the melancholy ideal of the immortal Ary Scheffer who gave
us Mignon aspiring to Paradise and Margaret dreaming of Faust Rose
leaning back on the couch held her head somewhat bowed upon her
bosom over which was crossed a handkerchief of black crape The light
streaming from a window opposite shone softly on her pure white
forehead crowned by two thick bands of chestnut hair Her look was
fixed and the open arch of her eyebrows now somewhat contracted
announced a mind occupied with painful thoughts Her thin white little
hands had fallen upon her knees but still held the embroidery on which
she had been engaged The profile of Blanche was visible leaning a
little towards her sister with an expression of tender and anxious
solicitude whilst her needle remained in the canvas as if she had just
ceased to work

Sister said Blanche in a low voice after some moments of silence
during which the tears seemed to mount to her eyes tell me what you
are thinking of You look so sad

I think of the Golden City of our dreams replied Rose almost in a
whisper after another short silence

Blanche understood the bitterness of these words Without speaking she
threw herself on her sisters neck and wept Poor girls the Golden
City of their dreams was Paris with their father in itParis the
marvellous city of joys and festivals through all of which the orphans
had beheld the radiant and smiling countenance of their sire But alas
the Beautiful City had been changed into a place of tears and death
and mourning The same terrible pestilence which had struck down their
mother in the heart of Siberia seemed to have followed them like a dark
and fatal cloud which always hovering above them hid the mild blue of
the sky and the joyous light of the sun

The Golden City of their dreams It was the place where perhaps one day
their father would present to them two young lovers good and fair as
themselves They love you he was to say they are worthy of you
Let each of you have a brother and me two sons Then what chaste
enchanting confusion for those two orphans whose hearts pure as
crystal had never reflected any image but that of Gabriel the
celestial messenger sent by their mother to protect them

We can therefore understand the painful emotion of Blanche when she
heard her sister repeat with bitter melancholy those words which
described their whole situation I think of the Golden City of our
dreams

Who knows proceeded Blanche drying her sisters tears perhaps
happiness may yet be in store for us

Alas if we are not happy with our father by usshall we ever be so

Yes when we rejoin our mother said Blanche lifting her eyes to
heaven

Then sister this dream may be a warningit is so like that we had in
Germany

The difference being that then the Angel Gabriel came down from heaven
to us and that this time he takes us from earth to our mother

And this dream will perhaps come true like the other my sister We
dreamt that the Angel Gabriel would protect us and he came to save us
from the shipwreck

And this time we dream that he will lead us to heaven Why should not
that happen also

But to bring that about sister our Gabriel who saved us from the
shipwreck must die also No no that must not happen Let us pray that
it may not happen

No it will not happenfor it is only Gabriels good angel who is so
like him that we saw in our dreams

Sister dear how singular is this dreamHere as in Germany we have
both dreamt the samethree times the very same

It is true The Angel Gabriel bent over us and looked at us with so
mild and sad an air saying Come my children come my sisters Your
mother waits for you Poor children arrived from so far added he in
his tender voice You have passed over the earth gentle and innocent
as two doves to repose forever in the maternal nest

Yes those were the words of the archangel said the other orphan
with a pensive air we have done no harm to any one and we have loved
those who loved uswhy should we fear to die

Therefore dear sister we rather smiled than wept when he took us
by the hand and spreading wide his beautiful white wings carried us
along with him to the blue depths of the sky

To heaven where our dear mother waited for us with open arms her face
all bathed in tears

Oh sweet sister one has not dreams like ours for nothing And then
added she looking at Rose with a sad smile that went to the heart
our death might perhaps end the sorrow of which we have been the
cause

Alas it is not our fault We love him so much But we are so timid and
sorrowful before him that he may perhaps think we love him not

So saying Rose took her handkerchief from her workbasket to dry her
fears a paper folded in the form of a letter fell out

At this sight the two shuddered and pressed close to one mother
and Rose said to Blanche in a trembling voice Another of these
lettersOh I am afraid It will doubtless be like the last

We must pick it up quickly that it may not be seen said Blanche
hastily stooping to seize the letter the people who take interest in
us might otherwise be exposed to great danger

But how could this letter come to us

How did the others come to be placed right under our hand and always
in the absence of our duenna

It is true Why seek to explain the mystery We should never be able to
do so Let us read the letter It will perhaps be more favorable to us
than the last And the two sisters read as followsContinue to love
your father dear children for he is very miserable and you are the
involuntary cause of his distress You will never know the terrible
sacrifices that your presence imposes on him but alas he is the
victim of his paternal duties His sufferings are more cruel than ever
spare him at least those marks of tenderness which occasion him so much
more pain than pleasure Each caress is a daggerstroke for he sees in
you the innocent cause of his misfortunes Dear children you must not
therefore despair If you have enough command over yourselves not to
torture him by the display of too warm a tenderness if you can mingle
some reserve with your affection you will greatly alleviate his sorrow
Keep these letters a secret from every one even from good Dagobert
who loves you so much otherwise both he and you your father and
the unknown friend who is writing to you will be exposed to the utmost
peril for your enemies are indeed formidable Courage and hope May
your fathers tenderness be once more free from sorrow and regretThat
happy day is perhaps not so far distant Burn this letter like all the
others

The above note was written with so much cunning that even supposing the
orphans had communicated it to their father or Dagobert it would at the
worst have been considered a strange intrusive proceeding but almost
excusable from the spirit in which it was conceived Nothing could
have been contrived with more perfidious art if we consider the cruel
perplexity in which Marshal Simon was struggling between the fear
of again leaving his children and the shame of neglecting what he
considered a sacred duty All the tenderness all the susceptibility
of heart which distinguished the orphans had been called into play by
these diabolical counsels and the sisters soon perceived that their
presence was in fact both sweet and painful to their father for
sometimes he felt himself incapable of leaving them and sometimes the
thought of a neglected duty spread a cloud of sadness over his brow
Hence the poor twins could not fail to value the fatal meaning of the
anonymous letters they received They were persuaded that from some
mysterious motive which they were unable to penetrate their presence
was often importunate and even painful to their father Hence the
growing sadness of Rose and Blanchehence the sort of fear and reserve
which restrained the expression of their filial tenderness A most
painful situation for the marshal who deceived by inexplicable
appearances mistook in his turn their manner of indifference to
himand so with breaking heart and bitter grief upon his face often
abruptly quitted his children to conceal his tears

And the desponding orphans said to each other We are the cause of our
fathers grief It is our presence which makes him so unhappy

The reader may new judge what ravages such a thought when fixed and
incessant must have made on these young loving timid and simple
hearts Haw could the orphans be on their guard against such anonymous
communications which spoke with reverence of all they loved and seemed
every day justified by the conduct of their father Already victims of
numerous plots and hearing that they were surrounded by enemies we
can understand how faithful to the advice of their unknown friend they
forbore to confide to Dagobert these letters in which he was so justly
appreciated The object of the proceeding was very plain By continually
harassing the marshal on all sides and persuading him of the coldness
of his children the conspirators might naturally hope to conquer the
hesitation which had hitherto prevented his again quitting his daughters
to embark in a dangerous enterprise To render the marshals life so
burdensome that he would desire to seek relief from his torments in airy
project of daring and generous chivalry was one of the ends proposed by
Rodinand as we have seen it wanted neither logic nor possibility

After having read the letter the two remained for a moment silent
and dejected Then Rose who held the paper in her hand started up
suddenly approached the chimneypiece and threw the letter into the
fire saying with a timid air We must burn it quickly or perhaps
some great danger will ensue

What greater misfortune can happen to us said Blanche despondingly
than to cause such sorrow to our father What can be the reason of it

Perhaps said Rose whose tears were slowly trickling down her cheek
he does not find us what he could have desired He may love us well
as the children of our poor mother but we are not the daughters he had
dreamed of Do you understand me sister

Yes yesthat is perhaps what occasioned all his sorrow We are so
badly informed so wild so awkward that he is no doubt ashamed of us
and as he loves us in spite of all it makes him suffer

Alas it is not our fault Our dear mother brought us up in the deserts
of Siberia as well as she could

Oh father himself does not reproach us with it only it gives him
pain

Particularly if he has friends whose daughters are very beautiful and
possessed of all sorts of talents Then he must bitterly regret that we
are not the same

Dost remember when he took us to see our cousin Mdlle Adrienne who
was so affectionate and kind to us that he said to us with admiration
Did you notice her my children How beautiful she is and what talent
what a noble heart and therewith such grace and elegance

Oh it is very true Mdlle de Cardoville is so beautiful her voice
is so sweet and gentle that when we saw and heard her we fancied that
all our troubles were at an end

And it is because of such beauty no doubt that our father comparing
us with our cousin and so many other handsome young ladies cannot be
very proud of us And he who is so loved and honored would have liked
to have been proud of his daughters

Suddenly Rose laid her hand on her sisters arm and said to her
with anxiety Listen listen they are talking very loud in fathers
bedroom

Yes said Blanche listening in her turn and I can hear him walking
That is his step

Good heaven how he raises his voice he seems to be in a great
passion he will perhaps come this way

And at the thought of their fathers comingthat father who really
adored themthe unhappy children looked in terror at each other The
sound of a loud and angry voice became more and more distinct and Rose
trembling through all her frame said to her sister Do not let us
remain here Come into our room

Why

We should hear without designing it the words of our fatherand he
does not perhaps know that we are so near

You are right Come come answered Blanche as she rose hastily from
her seat

Oh I am afraid I have never heard him speak in so angry a tone

Oh kind heaven said Blanche growing pale as she stopped
involuntarily It is to Dagobert that he is talking so loud

What can be the matterto make our father speak to him in that way

Alas some great misfortune must have happened

Oh sister do not let us remain here It pains me too much to hear
Dagobert thus spoken to

The crash of some article hurled with violence and broken to pieces in
the next room so frightened the orphans that pale and trembling with
emotion they rushed into their own apartment and fastened the door We
must now explain the cause of Marshal Simons violent anger




CHAPTER XLVIII THE STUNG LION

This was the scene the sound of which had so terrified Rose and
Blanche At first alone in his chamber in a state of exasperation
difficult to describe Marshal Simon had begun to walk hastily up and
down his handsome manly face inflamed with rage his eyes sparkling
with indignation while on his broad forehead crowned with shortcut
hair that was now turning gray large veins of which you might count
the pulsations were swollen almost to bursting and sometimes his
thick black moustache was curled with a convulsive motion not unlike
that which is seen in the visage of a raging lion And even as the
wounded lion in its fury harassed and tortured by a thousand invisible
darts walks up and down its den with savage wrath so Marshal Simon
paced the floor of his room as if bounding from side to side
sometimes he stooped as though bending beneath the weight of his anger
sometimes on the contrary he paused abruptly drew himself up to his
full height crossed his arms upon his vigorous chest and with raised
brow threatening and terrible look seemed to defy some invisible
enemy and murmur confused exclamations Then he stood like a man of war
and battle in all his intrepid fire

And now he stamped angrily with his foot approached the chimneypiece
and pulled the bell so violently that the bellrope remained in his
hand A servant hastened to attend to this precipitate summons Did you
not tell Dagobert that I wished to speak to him cried the marshal

I executed your graces orders but M Dagobert was accompanying his
son to the door and

Very well interrupted Marshal Simon with an abrupt and imperious
gesture

The servant went out and his master continued to walk up and down with
impatient steps crumpling in his rage a letter that he held in his
left hand This letter had been innocently delivered by Spoilsport
who seeing him come in had run joyously to meet him At length the
door opened and Dagobert appeared I have been waiting for you a long
time sirrah cried the marshal in an irritated tone

Dagobert more pained than surprised at this burst of anger which he
rightly attributed to the constant state of excitement in which the
marshal had now been for some time past answered mildly I beg your
pardon general but I was letting out my son

Read that sir said the marshal abruptly giving him the letter

While Dagobert was reading it the marshal resumed with growing anger
as he kicked over a chair that stood in his way Thus even in my
own house there are wretches bribed to harass me with incredible
perseverance Well have you read it sir

It is a fresh insult to add to the others said Dagobert coolly as
he threw the letter into the fire

The letter is infamousbut it speaks the truth replied the marshal
Dagobert looked at him in amazement

And can you tell who brought me this infamous letter continued the
marshal One would think the devil had a hand in itfor it was your
dog

Spoilsport said Dagobert in the utmost surprise

Yes answered the marshal bitterly it is no doubt a joke of your
invention

I have no heart for joking general answered Dagobert more and more
saddened by the irritable state of the marshal I cannot explain how it
happened Spoilsport is a good carrier and no doubt found the letter
in the house

And who can have left it there Am I surrounded by traitors Do you
keep no watch You in whom I have every confidence

Listen to me general

But the marshal proceeded without waiting to hear him What I have
made war for fiveandtwenty years I have battled with armies I have
struggled victoriously through the evil times of exile and proscription
I have withstood blows from maces of ironand now I am to be killed
with pins Pursued into my own house harassed with impunity worn out
tortured every minute to gratify some unknown miserable hateWhen I
say unknown I am wrongit is dAigrigny the renegade who is at the
bottom of all this I am sure I have in the world but one enemy and
he is the man I must finish with him for I am weary of thisit is too
much

But general remember he is a priest

What do I care for that Have I not seen him handle the sword I will
yet make a soldiers blood rise to the forehead of the traitor

But general

I tell you that I must be avenged on some one cried the marshal
with an accent of the most violent exasperation I tell you that I
mast find a living representative of these cowardly plots that I may at
once make an end of himThey press upon me from all sides they make
my life a hellyou know itand you do nothing to save me from these
tortures which are killing me as by a slow fire Can I have no one in
whom to trust

General I cant let you say that replied Dagobert in a calm but
firm voice

And why not

General I cant let you say that you have no one to trust to You
might end perhaps in believing it and then it would be even worse for
yourself than for those who well know their devotion for you and would
go through fire and water to serve you I am one of themand you know
it

These simple words pronounced by Dagobert with a tone of deep
conviction recalled the marshal to himself for although his honorable
and generous character might from time to time be embittered by
irritation and grief he soon recovered his natural equanimity So
addressing Dagobert in a less abrupt tone he said to him though still
much agitated You are right I could never doubt your fidelity But
anger deprives me of my senses This infamous letter is enough to drive
one mad I am unjust ungratefulyes ungratefuland to you

Do not think of me general With a kind word at the end you might
blow me up all the year round But what has happened

The generals countenance again darkened as he answered rapidly I am
looked down upon and despised

You

Yes I After all resumed the marshal bitterly why should I conceal
from you this new wound If I doubted you a moment I owe you some
compensation and you shall know all For some time past I perceived
that when I meet any of my old companions in arms they try to avoid
me

What was it to this that the anonymous letter alluded

Yes and it spoke the truth replied the marshal with a sigh of grief
and indignation

But it is impossible generalyou are so loved and respected

Those are mere words I speak of positive facts When I appear the
conversation is often interrupted Instead of treating me as an old
comrade they affect towards me a rigorously cold politeness There are
a thousand little shades a thousand trifles which wound the heart but
which it is impossible to notice

What you are now saying general quite confounds me replied
Dagobert You assure me of it and I am forced to believe you

Oh it is intolerable I was resolved to ease my heart of it so this
morning I went to General dHavrincourt who was colonel with me in the
Imperial Guard he is honor and honesty itself I went to him with
open heart I perceive said I the coldness that is shown me Some
calumny must be circulating to my disadvantage Tell me all about it
Knowing the attack I shall be able to defend myself

Well general

DHavrincourt remained impassible ceremoniously polite To all my
questions he answered coldly I am not aware my lord duke that any
calumny has been circulated with regard to youDo not call me
my lord duke my dear DHavrincourt we are old fellowsoldiers and
friends my honor is somewhat touchy I confess and I find that you and
our comrades do not receive me so cordially as in times past You
do not deny it I see I know I feel it To all this DHavrincourt
answered with the same coldness I have never seen any one wanting in
respect towards youI am not talking of respect exclaimed I as
I clasped his hand affectionately though I observed that he but feebly
returned the pressure I speak of cordiality confidence which I once
enjoyed while now I am treated like a stranger Why is it What has
occasioned this changeStill cold and reserved he answered These
distinctions are so nice marshal that it is impossible for me to give
you any opinion on the subjectMy heart swelled with grief and anger
What was I to do To quarrel with DHavrincourt would have been absurd
A sense of dignity forced me to break off the interview but it has
only confirmed my fears Thus added the marshal getting more and more
animated thus am I fallen from the esteem to which I am entitled thus
am I despised without even knowing the cause Is it not odious If
they would only utter a charge against meI should at least be able to
defend myself and to find an answer But no no not even a wordonly
the cold politeness that is worse than any insult Oh it is too much
too much for all this comes but in addition to other cares What a
life is mine since the death of my father If I did but find rest and
happiness at homebut no I come in but to read shameful letters and
still worse added the marshal in a heartrending tone and after a
moments hesitation to find my children grow more and more indifferent
towards meYes continued he perceiving the amazement of Dagobert
and yet they know how much I love them

Your daughters indifferent exclaimed Dagobert in astonishment You
make them such a reproach

Oh I do not blame them They have hardly had time to know me

Not had time to know you returned the soldier in a tone of
remonstrance and warming up in his turn Ah of what did their mother
talk to them except you and I too what could I teach your children
except to know and love you

You take their partthat is naturalthey love you better than they do
me said the marshal with growing bitterness Dagobert felt himself so
painfully affected that he looked at the marshal without answering

Yes continued the other yes it may be base and ungratefulbut no
matterTwenty times I have felt jealous of the affectionate confidence
which my children display towards you while with me they seem always to
be in fear If their melancholy faces ever grow animated for a moment
it is in talking to you in seeing you while for me they have nothing
but cold respectand that kills me Sure of the affection of my
children I would have braved and surmounted every difficulty Then
seeing that Dagobert rushed towards the door which led to the chamber of
Rose and Blanche the marshal asked Where are you going

For your daughters general

What for

To bring them face to face with youto tell them My children your
father thinks that you do not love himI will only say thatand then
you will see

Dagobert I forbid you to do it cried the marshal hastily

I dont care for thatyou have no right to be unjust to the poor
children said the soldier as he again advanced towards the door

Dagobert I command you to remain here cried the marshal

Listen to me general I am your soldier your inferior your servant
if you will said the old grenadier roughly but neither rank nor
station shall keep me silent when I have to defend your daughters
All must be explainedI know but one wayand that is to bring honest
people face to face

If the marshal had not seized him by the arm Dagobert would have
entered the apartment of the young girls

Remain said the marshal so imperiously that the soldier accustomed
to obedience hung his head and stood still

What would you do resumed the marshal Tell my children that I
think they do not love me induce them to affect a tenderness they do
not feelwhen it is not their fault but mine

Oh general said Dagobert in a tone of despair I no longer feel
anger in hearing you speak thus of your children It is such grief
that it breaks my heart

Touched by the expression of the soldiers countenance the marshal
continued less abruptly Come I may be wrong and yet I ask you
without bitterness or jealousy are not my children more confiding more
familiar with you than with me

God bless me general cried Dagobert if you come to that they are
more familiar with Spoilsport than with either of us You are their
father and however kind a father may be he must always command some
respect Familiar with me I should think so A fine story What the
devil should they respect in me who except that I am six feet
high and wear a moustache might pass for the old woman that nursed
themand then I must say that even before the death of your worthy
father you were sad and full of thought the children have remarked
that and what you take for coldness on their part is I am sure
anxiety for you Come general you are not just You complain because
they love you too much

I complain because I suffer said the marshal in an agony of
excitement I alone know my sufferings

They must indeed be grievous general said Dagobert carried further
than he would otherwise have gone by his attachment for the orphans
since those who love you feel them so cruelly

What sir more reproaches

Yes general reproaches cried Dagobert Your children have the
right to complain of you since you accuse them so unjustly

Sir said the marshal scarcely able to contain himself this is
enoughthis is too much

Oh yes it is enough replied Dagobert with rising emotion Why
defend unfortunate children who can only love and submit Why defend
them against your unhappy blindness

The marshal started with anger and impatience but then replied with a
forced calmness I needs must remember all that I owe youand I will
not forget it say what you will

But general cried Dagobert why will you not let me fetch your
children

Do you not see that this scene is killing me cried the exasperated
marshal Do you not understand that I will not have my children
witness what I suffer A fathers grief has its dignity sir and you
ought to feel for and respect it

Respect it nonot when it is founded on injustice

Enough sirenough

And not content with tormenting yourself cried Dagobert unable any
longer to control his feelings do you know what you will do You will
make your children die of sorrow Was it for this that I brought them
to you from the depths of Siberia

More reproaches

Yes for the worst ingratitude towards me is to make your children
unhappy

Leave the room sir cried the marshal quite beside himself and so
terrible with rage and grief that Dagobert regretting that he had gone
so far resumed I was wrong general I have perhaps been wanting in
respect to youforgive mebut

I forgive youonly leave me said the marshal hardly restraining
himself

One word general

I entreat you to leave meI ask it as a serviceis that enough
said the marshal with renewed efforts to control the violence of his
emotions

A deadly paleness succeeded to the high color which during this painful
scene had inflamed the cheeks of the marshal Alarmed at this symptom
Dagobert redoubled his entreaties I implore you general said he in
an agitated mice to permit me for one moment

Since you will have it so sir I must be the one to leave said the
marshal making a step towards the door

These words were said in such a manner that Dagobert could no longer
resist He hung his head in despair looked for a moment in silent
supplication at the marshal and then as the latter seemed yielding to
a new movement of rage the soldier slowly quitted the room

A few minutes had scarcely elapsed since the departure of Dagobert when
the marshal who after a long and gloomy silence had repeatedly drawn
near the door of his daughters apartment with a mixture of hesitation
and anguish suddenly made a violent effort wiped the cold sweat from
his brow and entered the chamber in which Rose and Blanche had taken
refuge




CHAPTER XLIX THE TEST

Dagobert was right in defending his children as he paternally called
Rose and Blanche and yet the apprehensions of the marshal with regard
to the coldness of his daughters were unfortunately justified by
appearances As he had told his father unable to explain the sad
and almost trembling embarrassment which his daughters felt in his
presence he sought in vain for the cause of what he termed their
indifference Now reproaching himself bitterly for not concealing from
them his grief at the death of their mother he feared he might have
given them to understand that they would be unable to console him now
supposing that he had not shown himself sufficiently tender and that
had chilled them with his military sternness and now repeating with
bitter regret that having always lived away from them he must be
always a stranger to them In a word the most unlikely suppositions
presented themselves by turns to his mind and whenever such seeds of
doubt suspicion or fear are blended with a warm affection they
will sooner or later develop themselves with fatal effect Yet
notwithstanding this fancied coldness from which he suffered so much
the affection of the marshal for his daughters was so true and deep
that the thought of again quitting them caused the hesitations which
were the torment of his life and provoked an incessant struggle between
his paternal love and the duty he held most sacred

The injurious calumnies which had been so skillfully propagated that
men of honor like his old brothers in arms were found to attach
some credit to them had been spread with frightful pertinacity by the
friends of the Princess de SaintDizier We shall describe hereafter the
meaning and object of these odious reports which joined with so
many other fatal injuries had filled up the measure of the marshals
indignation Inflamed with anger excited almost to madness by this
incessant stabbing with pins as he had himself called it and
offended at some of Dagoberts words he had spoken harshly to him
But after the soldiers departure when left to reflect in silence the
marshal remembered the warm and earnest expressions of the defender
of his children and doubt crossed his mind as to the reality of the
coldness of which he accused them Therefore having taken a terrible
resolution in case a new trial should confirm his desponding doubts he
entered as we before said his daughters chamber The discussion with
Dagobert had been so loud that the sound of the voices had confusedly
reached the ears of the two sisters even after they had taken refuge in
their bedroom So that on the arrival of their father their pale
faces betrayed their fear and anxiety At sight of the marshal whose
countenance was also much agitated the girls rose respectfully but
remained close together trembling in each others arms And yet there
was neither anger nor severity on their fathers faceonly a deep
almost supplicating grief which seemed to say My children I
sufferI have come to youconsole me love me or I shall die

The marshals countenance was at this moment so expressive that the
first impulse of fear once surmounted the sisters were about to throw
themselves into his arms but remembering the recommendations of the
anonymous letter which told them how painful any effusion of their
tenderness was to their father they exchanged a rapid glance and
remained motionless By a cruel fatality the marshal at this moment
burned to open his arms to his children He looked at them with love he
even made a slight movement as if to call them to him but he would
not attempt more for fear of meeting with no response Still the poor
children paralyzed by perfidious counsels remained mute motionless
trembling

It is all over thought he as he gazed upon them No chord of
sympathy stirs in their bosom Whether I gowhether I remainmatters
not to them No I am nothing to these childrensince at this awful
moment when they see me perhaps for the last time no filial instinct
tells them that their affection might save me still

During these terrible reflections the marshal had not taken his eyes
off his children and his manly countenance assumed an expression
at once so touching and mournfulhis look revealed so painfully the
tortures of his despairing soulthat Rose and Blanche confused
alarmed but yielding together to a spontaneous movement threw
themselves on their fathers neck and covered him with tears and
caresses Marshal Simon had not spoken a word his daughters had not
uttered a sound and yet all three had at length understood one another
A sympathetic shock had electrified and mingled those three hearts Vain
fears false doubts lying counsel all had yielded to the irresistible
emotion which had brought the daughters to their fathers arms A sudden
revelation gave them faith at the fatal moment when incurable suspicion
was about to separate them forever

In a second the marshal felt all this but words failed him Pale
bewildered kissing the brows the hair the hands of his daughters
weeping sighing smiling all in turn he was wild delirious drunk
with happiness At length he exclaimed I have found themor rather
I have never lost them They loved me and did not dare to tell me so
I overawed them And I thought it was my fault Heavens what good that
does what strength what heart what hopeHa ha cried he laughing
and weeping at the same time whilst he covered his children with
caresses they may despise me now they may harass me nowI defy them
all My own blue eyes my sweet blue eyes look at me well and inspire
me with new life

Oh father you love us then as much as we love you cried Rose with
enchanting simplicity

And we may often very often perhaps every day throw ourselves on
your neck embrace you and prove how glad we are to be with you

Show you dear father all the store of love we were heaping up in our
heartsso sad alas that we could not spend it upon you

Tell you aloud all that we think in secret

Yesyou may do soyou may do so said Marshal Simon faltering with
joy what prevented you my children But no do not answer enough of
the pastI know all I understand all You misinterpreted my gloom
and it made you sad I in my turn misinterpreted your sadness But
never mind I scarcely know what I am saying to you I only think of
looking at youand it dazzles meit confuses meit is the dizziness
of joy

Oh look at us father look into our eyes into our hearts cried
Rose with rapture

And you will read there happiness for us and love for you sir
added Blanche

Sir sir said the marshal in a tone of affectionate reproach what
does that mean Will you call me father if you please

Dear father your hand said Blanche as she took it and placed it on
her heart

Dear father your hand said Rose as she took the other hand of the
marshal Do you believe now in our love and happiness she continued

It is impossible to describe the charming expression of filial pride in
the divine faces of the girls as their father slightly pressing their
virgin bosoms seemed to count with delight the joyous pulsations of
their hearts

Oh yes happiness and affection can alone make the heart beat thus
cried the marshal

A hoarse sob heard in the direction of the open door made the three
turn round and there they saw the tall figure of Dagobert with the
black nose of Spoilsport reaching to his masters knee The soldier
drying his eyes and moustache with his little blue cotton handkerchief
remained motionless as the god Terminus When he could speak he
addressed himself to the marshal and shaking his head muttered in a
hoarse voice for the good man was swallowing his tears Did I not tell
you so

Silence said the marshal with a sign of intelligence You were a
better father than myself my old friend Come and kiss them I shall
not be jealous

The marshal stretched out his hand to the soldier who pressed it
cordially whilst the two sisters threw themselves on his neck and
Spoilsport according to custom wishing to have his share in the
general joy raised himself on his hind legs and rested his forepaws
against his masters back There was a moment of profound silence
The celestial felicity enjoyed during that moment by the marshal
his daughters and the soldier was interrupted by the barking of
Spoilsort who suddenly quitted the attitude of a biped The happy
group separated looked round and saw Loonys stupid face He looked
even duller than usual as he stood quite still in the doorway staring
with wide stretched eyes and holding a featherbroom under his arm and
in his hand the everpresent basket of wood

Nothing makes one so gay as happiness and though this grotesque figure
appeared at a very unseasonable moment it was received with frank
laughter from the blooming lips of Rose and Blanche Having made the
marshals daughters laugh after their long sadness Loony at once
acquired a claim to the indulgence of the marshal who said to him good
humoredly What do you want my lad

Its not me my lord duke answered Loony laying his hand on his
breast as if it were taking a vow so that his featherbrush fell down
from under his arm The laughter of the girls redoubled

It is not you said the marshal

Here Spoilsport Dagobert called for the honest dog seemed to have
a secret dislike for the pretended idiot and approached him with an
angry air

No my lord duke it is not me resumed Loony It is the footman who
told me to tell M Dagobert when I brought up the wood to tell my lord
duke as I was coming up with the basket that M Robert wants to see
him

The girls laughed still more at this new stupidity But at the name of
Robert Marshal Simon started

M Robert was the secret emissary of Rodin with regard to the possible
but adventurous enterprise of attempting the liberation of Napoleon II
After a moments silence the marshal whose face was still radiant with
joy and happiness said to Loony Beg M Robert to wait for me a moment
in my study

Yes my lord duke answered Loony bowing almost to the ground

The simpleton withdrew and the marshal said to his daughters in a
joyous tone You see that in a moment like this one does not leave
ones children even for M Robert

Oh thats right father cried Blanche gayly for I was already
very angry with this M Robert

Have you pen and paper at hand asked the marshal

Yes father there on the table said Rose hastily as she pointed
to a little desk near one of the windows towards which the marshal now
advanced rapidly

From motives of delicacy the girls remained where they were close to
the fireplace and caressed each other tenderly as if to congratulate
themselves in private on the unexpected happiness of this day

The marshal seated himself at the desk and made a sign to Dagobert to
draw near

While he wrote rapidly a few words in a firm hand he said to the
soldier with a smile in so low a tone that it was impossible for his
daughters to hear Do you know what I had almost resolved upon before
entering this room

What general

To blow my brains out It is to my children that I owe my life And
the marshal continued writing

Dagobert started at this communication and then replied also in a
whisper It would not have been with your pistols I took off the
caps

The marshal turned round hastily and looked at him with an air of
surprise But the soldier only nodded his head affirmatively and added
Thank heaven we have now done with all those ideas

The marshals only answer was to glance at his children his eyes
swimming with tenderness and sparkling with delight then sealing the
note he had written he gave it to the soldier and said to him Give
that to M Robert I will see him tomorrow

Dagobert took the letter and went out Returning towards his daughters
the marshal joyfully extended his arms to them and said Now young
ladies two nice kisses for having sacrificed M Robert to you Have
I not earned them And Rose and Blanche threw themselves on their
fathers neck

About the time that these events were taking place at Paris two
travellers wide apart from each other exchanged mysterious thoughts
through the breadth of space

CHAPTER L THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY OF ST JOHN THE BAPTIST

The sun is fast sinking In the depths of an immense piny wood in the
midst of profound solitude rise the ruins of an abbey once sacred to
St John the Baptist Ivy moss and creeping plants almost entirely
conceal the stones now black with age Some broken arches some
walls pierced with ovals still remain standing visible on the dark
background of the thick wood Looking down upon this mass of ruins from
a broken pedestal halfcovered with ivy a mutilated but colossal
statue of stone still keeps its place This statue is strange and awful
It represents a headless human figure Clad in the antique toga it
holds in its hand a dish and on that dish is a head This head is its
own It is the statue of St John the Baptist and Martyr put to death
by wish of Herodias

The silence around is solemn From time to time however is heard the
dull rustling of the enormous branches of the pinetrees shaken by the
wind Coppercolored clouds reddened by the setting sun pass slowly
over the forest and are reflected in the current of a brook which
deriving its source from a neighboring mass of rocks flows through the
ruins The water flows the clouds pass on the ancient trees tremble
the breeze murmurs

Suddenly through the shadow thrown by the overhanging wood which
stretches far into endless depths a human form appears It is a woman
She advances slowly towards the ruins She has reached them She treads
the once sacred ground This woman is pale her look sad her long
robe floats on the wind her feet covered with dust She walks with
difficulty and pain A block of stone is placed near the stream almost
at the foot of the statue of John the Baptist Upon this stone she sinks
breathless and exhausted worn out with fatigue And yet for many days
many years many centuries she has walked on unwearied

For the first time she feels an unconquerable sense of lassitude For
the first time her feet begin to fail her For the first time she
who traversed with firm and equal footsteps the moving lava of torrid
deserts while whole caravans were buried in drifts of fiery sandwho
passed with steady and disdainful tread over the eternal snows of
Arctic regions over icy solitudes in which no other human being could
livewho had been spared by the devouring flames of conflagrations and
by the impetuous waters of torrentsshe in brief who for centuries
had had nothing in common with humanityfor the first time suffers
mortal pain

Her feet bleed her limbs ache with fatigue she is devoured by burning
thirst She feels these infirmities yet scarcely dares to believe them
real Her joy would be too immense But now her throat becomes dry
contracted all on fire She sees the stream and throws herself on her
knees to quench her thirst in that crystal current transparent as
a mirror What happens then Hardly have her fevered lips touched the
fresh pure water than still kneeling supported on her hands she
suddenly ceases to drink and gazes eagerly on the limpid stream
Forgetting the thirst which devours her she utters a loud crya cry
of deep earnest religious joy like a note of praise and infinite
gratitude to heaven In that deep mirror she perceives that she has
grown older

In a few days a few hours a few minutes perhaps in a single second
she has attained the maturity of age She who for more than eighteen
centuries has been as a woman of twenty carrying through successive
generations the load of her imperishable youthshe has grown old and
may perhaps at length hope to die Every minute of her life may now
bring her nearer to the last home Transported by that ineffable hope
she rises and lifts her eyes to heaven clasping her hands in an
attitude of fervent prayer Then her eyes rest on the tall statue of
stone representing St John The head which the martyr carries in his
hand seems from beneath its halfclosed granite eyelid to cast upon
the Wandering Jewess a glance of commiseration and pity And it was she
Herodias who in the cruel intoxication of a pagan festival demanded
the murder of the saint And it is at the foot of the martyrs image
that for the first time the immortality which weighed on her for so
many centuries seems likely to find a term

Oh impenetrable mystery oh divine hope she cries The wrath of
heaven is at length appeased The hand of the Lord brings me to the
feet of the blessed martyr and I begin once more to feel myself a
human creature And yet it was to avenge his death that the same heaven
condemned me to eternal wanderings

Oh Lord grant that I may not be the only one forgiven May
hethe artisan who like me daughter of a king wanders on for
centurieslikewise hope to reach the end of that immense journey

Where is he Lord where is he Hast thou deprived me of the power once
bestowed to see and hear him through the vastness of intervening space
Oh in this mighty moment restore me that divine giftfor the more I
feel these human infirmities which I hail and bless as the end of
my eternity of ills the more my sight loses the power to traverse
immensity and my ear to catch the sound of that wanderers accent from
the other extremity of the globe

Night had fallen dark and stormy The wind rose in the midst of the
great pinetrees Behind their black summits through masses of dark
cloud slowly sailed the silver disk of the moon The invocation of the
Wandering Jewess had perhaps been heard Suddenly her eyes closedwith
hands clasped together she remained kneeling in the heart of the
ruinsmotionless as a statue upon a tomb And then she had a wondrous
dream




CHAPTER LI THE CALVARY

This was the vision of Herodias On the summit of a high steep rocky
mountain there stands a cross The sun is sinking even as when the
Jewess herself worn out with fatigue entered the ruins of St Johns
Abbey The great figure on the crosswhich looks down from this
Calvary on the mountain and on the vast dreary plain beyondstands
out white and pale against the dark blue clouds which stretch across
the heavens and assume a violent tint towards the horizon There where
the setting sun has left a long track of lurid light almost of the
hue of bloodas far as the eye can reach no vegetation appears on the
surface of the gloomy desert covered with sand and stones like the
ancient bed of some driedup ocean A silence as of death broods over
this desolate tract Sometimes gigantic black vultures with red
unfeathered necks luminous yellow eyes stooping from their lofty
flight in the midst of these solitudes come to make their bloody feast
on the prey they have carried off from less uncultivated regions

How then did this Calvary this place of prayer come to be erected so
far from the abodes of men This Calvary was prepared at a great cost by
a repentant sinner He had done much harm to his fellowcreatures and
in the hope of obtaining pardon for his crimes he had climbed this
mountain on his knees and become a hermit and lived there till his
death at the foot of this cross only sheltered by a roof of thatch
now long since swept away by the wind The sun is still sinking The
sky becomes darker The luminous lines on the horizon grow fainter and
fainter like heated bars of iron that gradually grow cool Suddenly
on the eastern side of the Calvary is heard the noise of some falling
stones which loosened from the side of the mountain roll down
rebounding to its base These stones have been loosened by the foot of
a traveller who after traversing the plain below has during the last
hour been climbing the steep ascent He is not yet visiblebut one
hears the echo of his treadslow steady and firm At length he
reaches the top of the mountain and his tall figure stands out against
the stormy sky

The traveller is pale as the great figure on the cross On his broad
forehead a black line extends from one temple to the other It is
the cobbler of Jerusalem The poor artisan who hardened by misery
injustice and oppression without pity for the suffering of the Divine
Being who bore the cross repulsed him from his dwelling and bade him
Go ON GO ON GO ON And from that day the avenging Deity has in his
turn said to the artisan of Jerusalem GO ON GO ON GO ON

And he has gone on without end or rest Nor did the divine vengeance
stop there From time to time death has followed the steps of the
wanderer and innumerable graves have been even as milestones on his
fatal path And if ever he found periods of repose in the midst of
his infinite grief it was when the hand of the Lord led him into deep
solitudes like that where he now dragged his steps along In passing
over that dreary plain or climbing to that rude Calvary he at least
heard no more the funeral knell which always always sounded behind him
in every inhabited region

All day long even at this hour plunged in the black abyss of his
thoughts following the fatal trackgoing whither he was guided by the
invisible hand with head bowed on his breast and eyes fixed upon
the ground the wanderer had passed over the plain and ascended the
mountain without once looking at the skywithout even perceiving the
Calvarywithout seeing the image upon the cross He thought of the
last descendants of his race He felt by the sinking of his heart
that great perils continued to threaten him And in the bitterness of
a despair wild and deep as the ocean the cobbler of Jerusalem seated
himself at the foot of the cross At this moment a farewell ray of the
setting sun piercing the dark mass of clouds threw a refection upon
the Calvary vivid as a conflagrations glare The Jew rested his
forehead upon his hand His long hair shaken by the evening breeze
fell over his pale facewhen sweeping it back from his brow he started
with surprisehe who had long ceased to wonder at anything With eager
glance he contemplated the long lock of hair that he held between his
fingers That hair until now black as night had become gray He also
like unto Herodias was growing older

His progress towards old age stopped for eighteen hundred years had
resumed its course Like the Wandering Jewess he might henceforth hope
for the rest of the grave Throwing himself on his knees he stretched
his hands towards heaven to ask for the explanation of the mystery
which filled him with hope Then for the first time his eyes rested on
the Crucified One looking down upon the Calvary even as the Wandering
Jewess had fixed her gaze on the granite eyelids of the Blessed Martyr

The Saviour his head bowed under the weight of his crown of thorns
seemed from the cross to view with pity and pardon the artisan who for
so many centuries had felt his curseand who kneeling with his body
thrown backward in an attitude of fear and supplication now lifted
towards the crucifix his imploring hands

Oh Messiah cried the Jew the avenging arm of heaven brings me back
to the foot of this heavy cross which thou didst bear when stopping
at the door of my poor dwelling thou wert repulsed with merciless
harshness and I said unto thee Go on go onAfter my long life of
wanderings I am again before this cross and my hair begins to whiten
Oh Lord in thy divine mercy hast thou at length pardoned me Have I
reached the term of my endless march Will thy celestial clemency grant
me at length the repose of the sepulchre which until now alas has
ever fled before meOh if thy mercy should descend upon me let it
fall likewise upon that woman whose woes are equal to mine own Protect
also the last descendants of my race What will be their fate Already
Lord one of themthe only one that misfortune had pervertedhas
perished from the face of the earth Is it for this that my hair grows
gray Will my crime only be expiated when there no longer remains in
this world one member of our accursed race Or does this proof of thy
powerful goodness Lord which restores me to the condition of humanity
serve also as a sign of the pardon and happiness of my family Will
they at length triumph over the perils which beset them Will they
accomplishing the good which their ancestor designed for his fellow
creatures merit forgiveness both for themselves and me Or will they
inexorably condemned as the accursed scions of an accursed stock
expiate the original stain of my detested crime

Oh tell metell me gracious Lord shall I be forgiven with them or
will they be punished with me

The twilight gave place to a dark and stormy night yet the Jew
continued to pray kneeling at the foot of the cross




CHAPTER LII THE COUNCIL

The following scene took place at SaintDizier House two days after
the reconciliation of Marshal Simon with his daughters The princess is
listening with the most profound attention to the words of Rodin The
reverend father according to his habit stands leaning against the
mantelpiece with his hands thrust into the pockets of his old brown
greatcoat His thick dirty shoes have left their mark on the ermine
hearthrug A deep sense of satisfaction is impressed on the Jesuits
cadaverous countenance Princess de SaintDizier dressed with that sort
of modest elegance which becomes a mother of the church keeps her
eyes fixed on Rodinfor the latter has completely supplanted Father
dAigrigny in the good graces of this pious lady The coolness audacity
lofty intelligence and rough and imperious character of the exsocius
have overawed this proud woman and inspired her with a sincere
admiration Even his filthy habits and often brutal repartees have their
charm for her and she now prefers them to the exquisite politeness and
perfumed elegance of the accomplished Father dAigrigny

Yes madame said Rodin in a sanctified tone for these people do not
take off their masks even with their accomplices yes madame we have
excellent news from our house at St Herem M Hardy the infidel the
freethinker has at length entered the pale of the holy Roman Catholic
and Apostolic Church Rodin pronounced these last word with a nasal
twang and the devout lady bowed her head respectfully

Grace has at length touched the heart of this impious man continued
Rodin and so effectually that in his ascetic enthusiasm he has
already wished to take the vows which will bind him forever to our
divine Order

So soon father said the princess in astonishment

Our statutes are opposed to this precipitation unless in the case of
a penitent in articulo mortison the very gasp of deathshould such
a person consider it necessary for his salvation to die in the habit
of our Order and leave us all his wealth for the greater glory of the
Lord

And is M Hardy in so dangerous a condition father

He has a violent fever After so many successive calamities which
have miraculously brought him into the path of salvation said Rodin
piously his frail and delicate constitution is almost broken up
morally and physically Austerities macerations and the divine joys of
ecstasy will probably hasten his passage to eternal life and in a few
clays said the priest shaking his head with a solemn air perhaps

So soon as that father

It is almost certain I have therefore made use of my dispensations to
receive the dear penitent as in articulo mortis a member of our
divine Company to which in the usual course he has made over all
his possessions present and to comeso that now he can devote himself
entirely to the care of his soul which will be one victim more rescued
from the claws of Satan

Oh father cried the lady in admiration it is a miraculous
conversion Father dAigrigny told me how you had to contend against the
influence of Abbe Gabriel

The Abbe Gabriel replied Rodin has been punished for meddling with
what did not concern him I have procured his suspension and he has
been deprived of his curacy I hear that he now goes about the cholera
hospitals to administer Christian consolation we cannot oppose
thatbut this universal comforter is of the true heretical stamp

He is a dangerous character no doubt answered the princess for he
has considerable influence over other men It must have needed all your
admirable and irresistible eloquence to combat the detestable counsels
of this Abbe Gabriel who had taken it into his head to persuade M
Hardy to return to the life of the world Really father you are a
second St Chrysostom

Tut tut madame said Rodin abruptly for he was very little
sensible to flattery keep that for others

I tell you that youre a second St Chrysostom father repeated the
princess with enthusiasm like him you deserve the name of Golden
Mouth

Stuff madame said Rodin brutally shrugging his shoulders my lips
are too pale my teeth too black for a mouth of gold You must be only
joking

But father

No madame you will not catch old birds with chaff replied Rodin
harshly I hate compliments and I never pay them

Your modesty must pardon me father said the princess humbly I
could not resist the desire to express to you my admiration for as
you almost predicted or at least foresaw two members of the Rennepont
family have within the last few months resigned all claim to the
inheritance

Rodin looked at Madame de SaintDizier with a softened and approving
air as he heard her thus describe the position of the two defunct
claimants For in Rodins view of the case M Hardy in consequence
of his donation and his suicidal asceticism belonged no longer to this
world

The lady continued One of these men a wretched artisan has been led
to his ruin by the exaggeration of his vices You have brought the
other into the path of salvation by carrying out his loving and tender
qualities Honor then to your foresight father for you said that you
would make use of the passions to attain your end

Do not boast too soon said Rodin impatiently Have you forgotten
your niece and the Hindoo and the daughters of Marshal Simon Have
they also made a Christian end or resigned their claim to share in this
inheritance

No doubtless

Hence you see madame we should not lose time in congratulating
ourselves on the past but make ready for the future The great day
approaches The first of June is not far off Heaven grant we may not
see the four surviving members of the family continue to live impenitent
up to that period and so take possession of this enormous propertythe
source of perdition in their handsbut productive of the glory of the
Church in the hands of our Company

True father

By the way you were to see your lawyers on the subject of your niece

I have seen them father However uncertain may be the chance of which
I spoke it is worth trying I shall know today I hope if it is
legally possible

Perhaps thenin the new condition of life to which she would be
reduced we might find means to effect her conversion said Rodin with
a strange and hideous smile until now since she has been so fatally
brought in contact with the Oriental the happiness of these two pagans
appears bright and changeless as the diamond Nothing bites into it not
even Faringheas tooth Let us hope that the Lord will wreak justice on
their vain and guilty felicity

This conversation was here interrupted by Father dAigrigny who entered
the room with an air of triumph and exclaimed Victory

What do you say asked the princess

He is gonelast night said Father dAigrigny

Who said Rodin

Marshal Simon replied the abbe

At last said Rodin unable to hide his joy

It was no doubt his interview with General dHavrincourt which
filled up the measure cried the princess for I know he had a long
conversation with the general who like so many others believed the
reports in circulation All means are good against the impious added
the princess by way of moral

Have you any details asked Rodin

I have just left Robert said Father dAigrigny His age and
description agree with the marshals and the latter travels with his
papers Only one thing has greatly surprised your emissary

What is that said Rodin

Until now he had always to contend with the hesitations of the
marshal and had moreover noticed his gloomy and desponding air
Yesterday on the contrary he found him so bright with happiness that
he could not help asking him the cause of the alteration

Well said Rodin and the princess together both extremely surprised

The marshal answered I am indeed the happiest man in the world for I
am going joyfully to accomplish a sacred duty

The three actors in this scene looked at each other in silence

And what can have produced this sudden change in the mind of the
marshal said the princess with a pensive air We rather reckon
on sorrow and every kind of irritation to urge him to engage in this
adventurous enterprise

I cannot make it out said Rodin reflecting but no matterhe
is gone We must not lose a moment to commence operations on his
daughters Has he taken that infernal soldier with him

No said Father dAigrigny unfortunately he has not done so Warned
by the past he will redouble his precautions and a man whom we
might have used against him at a pinch has just been taken with the
contagion

Who is that asked the princess

Morok I could count upon him anywhere and for anything He is lost
to us for should he recover from the cholera I fear he will fall a
victim to a horrible and incurable disease

How so

A few days ago he was bitten by one of the mastiffs of his menagerie
and the next day the dog showed symptoms of hydrophobia

Ah it is dreadful cried the princess and where is this unfortunate
man

He has been taken to one of the temporary hospitals established in
Paris for at present he has only been attacked with cholera It is
doubly unfortunate I repeat for he was a devoted determined fellow
ready for anything Now this soldier who has the care of the orphans
will be very difficult to get at and yet only through him can we hope
to reach Marshal Simons daughters

That is clear said Rodin thoughtfully

Particularly since the anonymous letters have again awakened his
suspicions added Father dAigrigny and

Talking of the anonymous letters said Rodin suddenly interrupting
Father dAigrigny there is a fact that you ought to know I will tell
you why

What is it

Besides the letters that you know of Marshal Simon has received a
number of others unknown to you in which by every possible means it
is tried to exasperate his irritation against yourselffor they remind
him of all the reasons he has to hate you and mock at him because your
sacred character shelters you from his vengeance

Father dAigrigny looked at Rodin with amazement colored in spite of
himself and said to him But for what purpose has your reverence acted
in this manner

First of all to clear myself of suspicion with regard to the letters
then to excite the rage of the marshal to madness by incessantly
reminding him of the just grounds he has to hate you and of the
impossibility of being avenged upon you This joined to the other
emotions of sorrow and anger which ferment in the savage bosom of this
man of bloodshed tended to urge him on to the rash enterprise which
is the consequence and the punishment of his idolatry for a miserable
usurper

That may be said Father dAigrigny with an air of constraint but
I will observe to your reverence that it was perhaps rather dangerous
thus to excite Marshal Simon against me

Why asked Rodin as he fixed a piercing look upon Father dAigrigny

Because the marshal excited beyond all bounds and remembering only
our mutual hate might seek me out

Well and what then

Well he might forget that I am a priest

Oh you are afraid are you said Rodin disdainfully interrupting
Father dAigrigny

At the words You are afraid the reverend father almost started from
his chair but recovering his coolness he answered Your reverence
is right yes I should be afraid under such circumstances I should
be afraid of forgetting that I am a priest and of remembering too well
that I have been a soldier

Really said Rodin with sovereign contempt You are still no further
than that stupid and savage point of honor Your cassock has not yet
extinguished the warlike fire So that if this brawling swordsman whose
poor weak head empty and sonorous as a drum is so easily turned with
the stupid jargon of Military honor oaths Napoleon IIif this
brawling bravo I say were to commit some violence against you it
would require a great effort I suppose for you to remain calm

It is useless I think said Father dAigrigny quite unable
to control his agitation for your reverence to enter upon such
questions

As your superior answered Rodin severely I have the right to ask
If Marshal Simon had lifted his hand against you

Sir cried the reverend father

There are no sirs herewe are only priests said Rodin harshly
Father dAigrigny held down his head scarcely able to repress his rage

I ask you continued Rodin obstinately if Marshal Simon had struck
you Is that clear

Enough in mercy said Father dAigrigny enough

Or if you like it better had Marshal Simon left the marks of his
fingers on your cheek resumed Rodin with the utmost pertinacity

Father dAigrigny pale as death ground his teeth in a kind of fury
at the very idea of such an insult while Rodin who had no doubt his
object in asking the question raised his flabby eyelids and seemed
to watch attentively the significant symptoms revealed in the agitated
countenance of the excolonel

At length recovering partly his presence of mind Father dAigrigny
replied in a forcedly calm tone If I were to be exposed to such an
insult I would pray heaven to give me resignation and humility

And no doubt heaven would hear your prayers said Rodin coldly
satisfied with the trial to which he had just put him Besides you are
now warned and it is not very probable added he with a grim smile
that Marshal Simon will ever return to test your humility But if he
were to return said Rodin fixing on the reverend father a long and
piercing look you would know how to show this brutal swordsman in
spite of all his violence what resignation and humility there is in a
Christian soul

Two humble knocks at the door here interrupted the conversation for a
moment A footman entered bearing a large sealed packet on a salver
which he presented to the princess After this he withdrew Princess
de SaintDizier having by a look asked Rodins permission to open the
letter began to read itand a cruel satisfaction was soon visible on
her face

There is hope cried she addressing herself to Rodin the demand is
rigorously legal and the consequence may be such as we desire In a
word my niece may any day be exposed to complete destitution She
who is so extravagant what a change in her life

We shall then no doubt have some hold on that untamable character
said Rodin with a meditative air for till now all has failed in
that direction and one would suppose some kinds of happiness are
invulnerable added the Jesuit gnawing his flat and dirty nails

But to obtain the result we desire we must exasperate my nieces
pride It is therefore absolutely necessary that I should see and
talk to her said the Princess de SaintDizier reflecting

Mdlle de Cardoville will refuse this interview said Father
dAigrigny

Perhaps replied the princess But she is so happy that her audacity
must be at its height Yes yesI know herand I will write in such a
manner that she will come

You think so asked Rodin with a doubtful air

Do not fear it father answered the lady she will come And her
pride once brought into play we may hope a good deal from it

We must then act lady resumed Rodin yes act promptly The moment
approaches Hate and suspicion are awake There is not a moment to
lose

As for hate replied the princess Mdlle de Cardoville must have
seen to what her lawsuit would lead about what she called her illegal
detention in a lunatic asylum and that of the two young ladies in St
Marys Convent Thank heaven we have friends everywhere I know from
good authority that the case will break down from want of evidence in
spite of the animosity of certain parliamentary magistrates who shall
be well remembered

Under these circumstances replied Rodin the departure of the
marshal gives us every latitude We must act immediately on his
daughters

But how said the princess

We must see them resumed Rodin talk with them study them Then we
shall act in consequence

But the soldier will not leave them a second said Father dAigrigny

Then replied Rodin we must talk to them in presence of the soldier
and get him on our side

That hope is idle cried Father dAigrigny You do not know the
military honor of his character You do not know this man

Dont I know him said Rodin shrugging his shoulders Did not Mdlle
de Cardoville present me to him as her liberator when I denounced you
as the soul of the conspiracy Did I not restore to him his ridiculous
imperial relichis cross of honorwhen we met at Dr Baleiniers Did
I not bring him back the girls from the convent and place them in the
arms of their father

Yes replied the princess but since that time my abominable niece
has either guessed or discovered all She told you so herself father

She told me that she considered me her most mortal enemy said
Rodin Be it so But did she tell the same to the marshal Has she
ever mentioned me to him and if she have done so has the marshal
communicated this circumstance to his soldier It may be so but it is
by no means sure in any case I must ascertain the fact if the soldier
treats me as an enemy we shall see what is next to be donebut I will
first try to be received as a friend

When asked the princess

Tomorrow morning replied Rodin

Good heaven my clear father cried the Princess de SaintDizier in
alarm if this soldier were to treat you as an enemybeware

I always beware madame I have had to face worse enemies than he is
said the Jesuit showing his black teeth the cholera to begin with

But he may refuse to see you and in what way will you then get at
Marshal Simons daughters said Father dAigrigny

I do not yet know answered Rodin But as I intend to do it I shall
find the means

Father said the princess suddenly on reflection these girls have
never seen me and I might obtain admittance to them without sending in
my name

That would be perfectly useless at present madame for I must first
know what course to take with respect to them I must see and converse
with them at any cost and then after I have fixed my plan your
assistance may be very useful In any case please to be ready to
morrow madame to accompany me

To what place father

To Marshal Simons

To the marshals

Not exactly You will get into your carriage and I will take a
hackneycoach I will then try to obtain an interview with the girls
and during that time you will wait for me at a few yards from the
house If I succeed and require your aid I will come and fetch you I
can give you my instructions without any appearance of concert between
us

I am content reverend father but in truth I tremble at the thought
of your interview with that rough trooper

The Lord will watch over his servant madame replied Rodin As
for you father added he addressing the Abbe dAigrigny despatch
instantly to Vienna the note which is all prepared to announce the
departure and speedy arrival of the marshal Every precaution has been
taken I shall write more fully this evening

The next morning about eight oclock the Princess de SaintDizier
in her carriage and Rodin in his hackneycoach took the direction of
Marshal Simons house




CHAPTER LIII HAPPINESS

Marshal Simon has been absent two days It is eight oclock in the
morning Dagobert walking on tiptoe with the greatest caution so as
not to make the floor creak beneath his tread crosses the room which
leads to the bedchamber of Rose and Blanche and applies his ear to the
door of the apartment With equal caution Spoilsport follows exactly
the movements of his master The countenance of the soldier is uneasy
and full of thought As he approaches the door he says to himself I
hope the dear children heard nothing of what happened in the night It
would alarm them and it is much better that they should not know it at
present It might afflict them sadly poor dears and they are so gay
so happy since they feel sure of their fathers love for them They
bore his departure so bravely I would not for the world that they
should know of this unfortunate event

Then as he listened the soldier resumed I hear nothingand yet they
are always awake so early Can it be sorrow

Dagoberts reflections were here interrupted by two frank hearty bursts
of laughter from the interior of the bedroom

Come they are not so sad as I thought said the soldier breathing
more freely Probably they know nothing about it

Soon the laughter was again heard with redoubled force and the
soldier delighted at this gayety so rare on the part of his
children was much affected by it the tears started to his eyes at the
thought that the orphans had at length recovered the serenity natural to
their age then passing from one emotion to the other still listening
at the door with his body leaning forward and his hands resting on
his knees Dagoberts lip quivered with an expression of mute joy and
shaking his head a little he accompanied with his silent laughter
the increasing hilarity of the young girls At last as nothing is so
contagious as gayety and as the worthy soldier was in an ecstasy of
joy he finished by laughing aloud with all his might without knowing
why and only because Rose and Blanche were laughing Spoilsport had
never seen his master in such a transport of delight he looked at him
for a while in deep and silent astonishment and then began to bark in a
questioning way

At this wellknown sound the laughter within suddenly ceased and a
sweet voice still trembling with joyous emotion exclaimed Is it you
Spoilsport that have come to wake us The dog understood what was
said wagged his tail held down his ears and approaching close to the
door answered the appeal of his young mistress by a kind of friendly
growl

Spoilsport said Rose hardly able to restrain her laughter you are
very early this morning

Tell us what oclock it is if you please old fellow added Blanche

Young ladies it is past eight said suddenly the gruff voice of
Dagobert accompanying this piece of humor with a loud laugh

A cry of gay surprise was heard and then Rose resumed Goodmorning
Dagobert

Goodmorning my children You are very lazy today I must tell you

It is not our fault Our dear Augustine has not yet been to call us We
are waiting for her

Oh there it is said Dagobert to himself his features once more
assuming an expression of anxiety Then he returned aloud in a tone of
some embarrassment for the worthy man was no hand at a falsehood My
children our companion went out this morningvery early She is gone
to the countryon businessshe will not return for some daysso you
had better get up by yourselves for today

Our good Madame Augustine exclaimed Blanche with interest I hope
it is nothing bad that has made her leave suddenlyeh Dagobert

No nonot at allonly business answered the soldier To see one
of her relations

Oh so much the better said Rose Well Dagobert when we call you
can come in

I will come back in a quarter of an hour said the soldier as
he withdrew and he thought to himself I must lecture that fool
Loonyfor he is so stupid and so fond of talking that he will let it
all out

The name of the pretended simpleton will serve as a natural transition
to inform the reader of the cause of the hilarity of the sisters They
were laughing at the numberless absurdities of the idiot The girls rose
and dressed themselves each serving as ladysmaid to the other Rose
had combed and arranged Blanches hair it was now Blanches turn to do
the same for her sister Thus occupied they formed a charming picture
Rose was seated before the dressingtable her sister standing behind
her was smoothing her beautiful brown hair Happy age so little
removed from childhood that present joy instantly obliterates the
traces of past sorrow But the sisters felt more than joy it was
happiness deep and unalterable for their father loved them and their
happiness was a delight and not a pain to him Assured of the affection
of his children he also thanks to them no longer feared any grief
To those three beings thus certain of their mutual love what was a
momentary separation Having explained this we shall understand
the innocent gayety of the sisters notwithstanding their fathers
departure and the happy joyous expression which now filled with
animation their charming faces on which the late fading rose had begun
once more to bloom Their faith in the future gave to their countenances
something resolute and decisive which added a degree of piquancy to the
beauty of their enchanting features

Blanche in smoothing her sisters hair let fall the comb and as she
was stooping to pick it up Rose anticipated her saying If it had
been broken we would have put it into the handlebasket

Then the two laughed merrily at this expression which reminded them of
an admirable piece of folly on the part of Loony

The supposed simpleton had broken the handle of a cup and when the
governess of the young ladies had reprimanded him for his carelessness
he had answered Never mind madame I have put it into the handle
basket

The handlebasket what is that

Yes Madame it is where I keep all the handles I break off the
things

Dear me said Rose drying her eyes how silly it is to laugh at such
foolishness

It is droll replied Blanche how can we help it

All I regret is that father cannot hear us laugh

He was so happy to see us gay

We must write to him today the story of the handlebasket

And that of the featherbrush to show that according to promise we
kept up our spirits during his absence

Write to him sister no he is to write to us and we are not to
answer his letters

True well then I have an idea Let us address letters to him here
Dagobert can put them into the post and on his return our father will
read our correspondence

That will be charming What nonsense we will write to him since he
takes pleasure in it

And we too like to amuse ourselves

Oh certainly fathers last words have given us so much courage

As I listened to them I felt quite reconciled to his going

When he said to us My children I will confide in you all I can I
go to fulfill a sacred duty and I must be absent for some time for
though when I was blind enough to doubt your affection I could not
make up my mind to leave you my conscience was by no means tranquil
Grief takes such an effect on us that I had not the strength to come to
a decision and my days were passed in painful hesitation But now that
I am certain of your tenderness all this irresolution has ceased and
I understand how one duty is not to be sacrificed to another and that I
have to perform two duties at once both equally sacred and this I now
do with joy and delight and courage

Go on sister cried Blanche rising to draw nearer to Rose I think
I hear our father when I remember those words which must console and
support us during his absence

And then our father continued Instead of grieving at my departure
you would rejoice in it you should be proud and happy I go to perform
a good and generous act Fancy to yourselves that there is somewhere a
poor orphan oppressed and abandoned by alland that the father of that
orphan was once my benefactor and that I had promised him to protect
his sonand that the life of that son is now in periltell me my
children would you regret that I should leave you to fly to the aid of
such an orphan

No no brave father we answered we should not then be your
daughters continued Rose with enthusiasm Count upon us We should
be indeed unhappy if we thought that our sorrow could deprive thee of
thy courage Go and every day we will say to ourselves proudly It was
to perform a great and noble duty that our father left uswe can wait
calmly for his return

How that idea of duty sustains one sister resumed Rose with growing
enthusiasm It gave our father the courage to leave us without regret
and to us the courage to bear his absence gayly

And then how calm we are now Those mournful dreams which seemed to
portend such sad events no longer afflict us

I tell you sister this time we are really happy once for all

And then do you feel like me I fancy that I am stronger and more
courageous and that I could brave every danger

I should think so We are strong enough now Our father in the midst
you on one side I on the other

Dagobert in the vanguard and Spoilsport in the rear Then the army
will be complete and let em come on by thousands added a gruff but
jovial voice interrupting the girl as Dagobert appeared at the half
open door of the room It was worth looking at his face radiant with
joy for the old fellow had somewhat indiscreetly been listening to the
conversation

Oh you were listening Paul Pry said Rose gayly as she entered the
adjoining room with her sister and both affectionately embraced the
soldier

To be sure I was listening and I only regretted not to have ears
as large as Spoilsports Brave good girls thats how I like to see
youbold as brass and saying to care and sorrow Right about face
march go to the devil

He will want to make us swear now said Rose to her sister laughing
with all her might

Well now and then it does no harm said the soldier it relieves
and calms one when if one could not swear by five hundred thousand
de

Thats enough said Rose covering with her pretty hand the gray
moustache so as to stop Dagobert in his speech If Madame Augustine
heard you

Our poor governess so mild and timid resumed Blanche How you would
frighten her

Yes said Dagobert as he tried to conceal his rising embarrassment
but she does not hear us She is gone into the country

Good worthy woman replied Blanche with interest She said
something of you which shows her excellent heart

Certainly resumed Rose for she said to us in speaking of you Ah
young ladies my affection must appear very little compared with M
Dagoberts But I feel that I also have the right to devote myself to
you

No doubt no doubt she has a heart of gold answered Dagobert Then
he added to himself Its as if they did it on purpose to bring the
conversation back to this poor woman

Father made a good choice continued Rose She is the widow of an old
officer who was with him in the wars

When we were out of spirits said Blanche you should have seen her
uneasiness and grief and how earnestly she set about consoling us

I have seen the tears in her eyes when she looked at us resumed Rose
Oh she loves us tenderly and we return her affection With regard to
that Dagobert we have a plan as soon as our father comes back

Be quiet sister said Blanche laughing Dagobert will not keep our
secret

He

Will you keep it for us Dagobert

I tell you what said the soldier more and more embarrassed you had
better not tell it to me

What can you keep nothing from Madame Augustine

Ah Dagobert Dagobert said Blanche gayly holding up her finger at
the soldier I suspect you very much of paying court to our governess

I pay court said the soldierand the expression of his face was so
rueful as he pronounced these words that the two sisters burst out
laughing

Their hilarity was at its height when the door opened and Loony advanced
into room announcing with a loud voice M Rodin In fact the Jesuit
glided almost imperceptibly into the apartment as if to take possession
of the ground Once there he thought the game his own and his reptile
eyes sparkled with joy It would be difficult to paint the surprise of
the two sisters and the anger of the soldier at this unexpected visit

Rushing upon Loony Dagobert seized him by the collar and exclaimed
Who gave you leave to introduce any one here without my permission

Pardon M Dagobert said Loony throwing himself on his knees and
clasping his hands with an air of idiotic entreaty

Leave the roomand you too added the soldier with a menacing
gesture as he turned towards Rodin who had already approached the
girls with a paternal smile on his countenance

I am at your orders my dear sir said the priest humbly and he made
a low bow but without stirring from the spot

Will you go cried the soldier to Loony who was still kneeling and
who thanks to the advantages of this position was able to utter a
certain number of words before Dagobert could remove him

M Dagobert said Loony in a doleful voice I beg pardon for bringing
up the gentleman without leave but alas my head is turned because of
the misfortune that happened to Madame Augustine

What misfortune cried Rose and Blanche together as they advanced
anxiously towards Loony

Will you go thundered Dagobert shaking the servant by the collar to
force him to rise

Speakspeak said Blanche interposing between the soldier and his
prey What has happened to Madame Augustine

Oh shouted Loony in spite of the cuffs of the soldier Madame
Augustine was attacked in the night with cholera and taken

He was unable to finish Dagobert struck him a tremendous blow with
his fist right on the jaw and putting forth his still formidable
strength the old horsegrenadier lifted him to his legs and with one
violent kick bestowed on the lower part of his back sent him rolling
into the ante chamber

Then turning to Rodin with flushed cheek and sparkling eye Dagobert
pointed to the door with an expressive gesture and said in an angry
voice Now be off with you and that quickly

I must pay my respects another time my dear sir said Rodin as he
retired towards the door bowing to the young girls




CHAPTER LIV DUTY

Rodin retreating slowly before the fire of Dagoberts angry looks
walked backwards to the door casting oblique but piercing glances at
the orphans who were visibly affected by the servants intentional
indiscretion Dagobert had ordered him not to speak before the girls of
the illness of their governess and that was quite enough to induce the
simpleton to take the first opportunity of doing so

Rose hastily approached the soldier and said to him Is it trueis
it really true that poor Madame Augustine has been attacked with the
cholera

NoI do not knowI cannot tell replied the soldier hesitating
besides what is it to you

Dagobert you would conceal from us a calamity said Blanche I
remember now your embarrassment when we spoke to you of our governess

If she is ill we ought not to abandon her She had pity on our
sorrows we ought to pity her sufferings

Come sister come to her room said Blanche advancing towards the
door where Rodin had stopped short and stood listening with growing
attention to this unexpected scene which seemed to give him ample food
for thought

You will not leave this room said the soldier sternly addressing
the two sisters

Dagobert replied Rose firmly it is a sacred duty and it would be
cowardice not to fulfil it

I tell you that you shall not leave the room said the soldier
stamping his foot with impatience

Dagobert replied Blanche with as resolute an air as her sisters
and with a kind of enthusiasm which brought the blood to her fair cheek
our father when he left us give us an admirable example of devotion
and duty He would not forgive us were we to forget the lesson

What cried Dagobert in a rage and advancing towards the sisters to
prevent their quitting the apartment you think that if your governess
had the cholera I would let you go to her under the pretext of
dutyYour duty is to live to live happy for your fathers sakeand
for mine into the bargainso not a word more of such folly

We can run no danger by going to our governess in her room said Rose

And if there were danger added Blanche we ought not to hesitate
So Dagobert be good and let us pass

Rodin who had listened to what precedes with sustained attention
suddenly started as if a thought had struck him his eye shone
brightly and an expression of fatal joy illumined his countenance

Dagobert do not refuse said Blanche You would do for us what you
reproach us with wishing to do for another

Dagobert had as it were till now stood in the path of the Jesuit and
the twins by keeping close to the door but after a moments reflection
he shrugged his shoulders stepped to one side and said calmly I was
an old fool Come young ladies if you find Madame Augustine in the
house I will allow you to remain with her

Surprised at these words the girls stood motionless and irresolute

If our governess is not here where is she then said Rose

You think perhaps that I am going to tell you in the excitement in
which you are

She is dead cried Rose growing pale

No nobe calm said the soldier hastily I swear to you by your
fathers honor that she is not dead At the first appearance of the
disorder she begged to be removed from the house fearing the contagion
for those in it

Good and courageous woman said Rose tenderly And you will not allow
us

I will not allow you to go out even if I have to lock you up in your
room cried the soldier again stamping with rage then remembering
that the blunderheads indiscretion was the sole cause of this
unfortunate incident he added with concentrated fury Oh I will
break my stick upon that rascals back

So saying he turned towards the door where Rodin still stood silent
and attentive dissembling with habitual impassibility the fatal hopes
he had just conceived in his brain The girls no longer doubting the
removal of their governess and convinced that Dagobert would not tell
them whither they had conveyed her remained pensive and sad

At sight of the priest whom he had forgotten for the moment the
soldiers rage increased and he said to him abruptly Are you still
there

I would merely observe to you my dear sir said Rodin with that air
of perfect good nature which he knew so well how to assume that you
were standing before the door which naturally prevented me from going
out

Well now nothing prevents youso file off

Certainly I will file off if you wish it my dear sir though I think
I have some reason to be surprised at such a reception

It is no reception at allso begone

I had come my dear sir to speak to you

I have no time for talking

Upon business of great importance

I have no other business of importance than to remain with these
children

Very good my dear sir said Rodin pausing on the threshold I
will not disturb you any longer excuse my indiscretion The bearer of
excellent news from Marshal Simon I came

News from our father cried Rose drawing nearer to Rodin

Oh speak speak sir added Blanche

You have news of the marshal said Dagobert glancing suspiciously at
Rodin Pray what is this news

But Rodin without immediately answering the question returned from the
threshold into the room and contemplating Rose and Blanche by turns
with admiration he resumed What happiness for me to be able to bring
some pleasure to these dear young ladies They are even as I left them
graceful and fair and charmingonly less sad than on the day when I
fetched them from the gloomy convent in which they were kept prisoners
to restore them to the arms of their glorious father

That was their place and this is not yours said Dagobert harshly
still holding the door open behind Rodin

Confess at least that I was not so much out of place at Dr
Baleiniers said the Jesuit with a cunning air You know for it
was there that I restored to you the noble imperial cross you so much
regrettedthe day when that good Mdlle de Cardoville only prevented
you from strangling me by telling you that I was her liberator Aye
it was just as I have the honor of stating young ladies added Rodin
with a smile this brave soldier was very near strangling me for be
it said without offense he has in spite of his age a grasp of iron
Ha ha the Prussians and Cossacks must know that better than I

These few words reminded Dagobert and the twins of the services which
Rodin had really rendered them and though the marshal had heard
Mdlle de Cardoville speak of Rodin as of a very dangerous man he
had forgotten in the midst of so many anxieties to communicate this
circumstance to Dagobert But this latter warned by experience felt
in spite of favorable appearances a secret aversion for the Jesuit so
he replied abruptly The strength of my grasp has nothing to do with
the matter

If I allude to that little innocent playfulness on your part my dear
sir said Rodin in his softest tone approaching the two sisters with
a wriggle which was peculiar to him if I allude to it you see it was
suggested by the involuntary recollection of the little services I
was happy enough to render you Dagobert looked fixedly at Rodin who
instantly veiled his glance beneath his flabby eyelids

First of all said the soldier after a moments silence a true man
never speaks of the services he has rendered and you come back three
times to the subject

But Dagobert whispered Rose if he brings news of our father

The soldier made a sign as if to beg the girl to let him speak
and resumed looking full at Rodin You are cunning but Im no raw
recruit

I cunning said Rodin with a sanctified air

Yes very You think to puzzle me with your fine phrases but Im
not to be caught in that way Just listen to me Some of your band of
blackgowns stole my cross you returned it to me Some of the same band
carried off these children you brought them back It is also true that
you denounced the renegade DAigrigny But all this only proves two
things first that you were vile enough to be the accomplice of these
scoundrels and secondly that having been their accomplice you were
base enough to betray them Now those two facts are equally bad and I
suspect you most furiously So march off at once your presence is not
good for these children

But my dear sir

I will have no buts answered Dagobert in an angry voice When a man
of your look does good it is only to hide some evil and one must be on
guard

I understand your suspicions said Rodin coolly hiding his growing
disappointment for he had hoped it would have been easy to coax the
soldier but if you reflect what interest have I in deceiving you
And in what should the deception consist

You have some interest or other in persisting to remain here when I
tell you to go away

I have already had the honor of informing you of the object of my
visit my dear sir

To bring news of Marshal Simon

That is exactly the case I am happy enough to have news of the
marshal Yes my dear young ladies added Rodin as he again approached
the two sisters to recover as it were the ground he had lost I have
news of your glorious father

Then come to my room directly and you can tell it to me replied
Dagobert

What you would be cruel enough to deprive these dear ladies of the
pleasure

By heaven sir cried Dagobert in a voice of thunder you will make
me forget myself I should be sorry to fling a man of your age down the
stairs Will you be gone

Well well said Rodin mildly do not be angry with a poor old man
I am really not worth the trouble I will go with you to your room and
tell you what I have to communicate You will repent not having let me
speak before these dear young ladies but that will be your punishment
naughty man

So saying Rodin again bowed very low and concealing his rage and
vexation left the room before Dagobert who made a sign to the two
sisters and then followed closing the door after him

What news of our father Dagobert said Rose anxiously when the
soldier returned after a quarter of an hours absence

Well that old conjurer knows that the marshal set out in good spirits
and he seems acquainted with M Robert How could he be informed of all
this I cannot tell added the soldier with a thoughtful air but it
is only another reason to be on ones guard against him

But what news of our father asked Rose

One of that old rascals friends I think him a rascal still knows
your father he tells me and met him fiveandtwenty leagues from here
Knowing that this man was coming to Paris the marshal charged him to
let you know that he was in perfect health and hoped soon to see you
again

Oh what happiness cried Rose

You see you were wrong to suspect the poor old man Dagobert added
Blanche You treated him so harshly

Possibly so but I am not sorry for it

And why

I have my reasons and one of the best is that when I saw him came in
and go sidling and creeping round about us I felt chilled to the marrow
of my bones without knowing why Had I seen a serpent crawling towards
you I should not have been more frightened I knew of course that he
could not hurt you in my presence but I tell you my children in spite
of the services he has no doubt rendered us it was all I could do to
refrain from throwing him out of the window Now this manner of proving
my gratitude is not natural and one must be on ones guard against
people who inspire us with such ideas

Good Dagobert it is your affection for us that makes you so
suspicious said Rose in a coaxing tone it proves how much you love
us




CHAPTER LV THE IMPROVISED HOSPITAL

Among a great number of temporary hospitals opened at the time of the
cholera in every quarter of Paris one had been established on the
groundfloor of a large house in the Rue du MontBlanc The vacant
apartments had been generously placed by their proprietor at the
disposal of the authorities and to this place were carried a number
of persons who being suddenly attacked with the contagion were
considered in too dangerous a state to be removed to the principal
hospitals

Two days had elapsed since Rodins visit to Marshal Simons daughters
Shortly after he had been expelled the Princess de SaintDizier had
entered to see them under the cloak of being a housetohouse visitor
to collect funds for the cholera sufferers

Choosing the moment when Dagobert deceived by her ladylike demeanor
had withdrawn she counselled the twins that it was their duty to go
and see their governess whom she stated to be in the hospital we now
describe

It was about ten oclock in the morning The persons who had watched
during the night by the sick people in the hospital established in
the Rue du MontBlanc were about to be relieved by other voluntary
assistants

Well gentlemen said one of those newly arrived how are we getting
on Has there been any decrease last night in the number of the sick

Unfortunately no but the doctors think the contagion has reached its
height

Then there is some hope of seeing it decrease

And have any of the gentlemen whose places we come to take been
attacked by the disease

We came eleven strong last night we are only nine now

That is bad Were these two persons taken off rapidly

One of the victims a young man of twentyfive years of age a cavalry
officer on furlough was struck as it were by lightning In less than a
quarter of an hour he was dead Though such facts are frequent we were
speechless with horror

Poor young man

He had a word of cordial encouragement and hope for every one He had
so far succeeded in raising the spirits of the patients that some of
them who were less affected by the cholera than by the fear of it were
able to quit the hospital nearly well

What a pity So good a young man Well he died gloriously it requires
as much courage as on the field of battle

He had only one rival in zeal and courage and that is a Young priest
with an angelic countenance whom they call the Abbe Gabriel He is
indefatigable he hardly takes an hours rest but runs from one to
the other and offers himself to everybody He forgets nothing The
consolation which he offers come from the depths of his soul and are
not mere formalities in the way of his profession No no I saw him
weep over a poor woman whose eyes he had closed after a dreadful agony
Oh if all priests were like him

No doubt a good priest is most worthy of respect But who is the
other victim of last night

Oh his death was frightful Do not speak of it I have still the
horrible scene before my eyes

A sudden attack of cholera

If it had only been the contagion I should not so shudder at the
remembrance

What then did he die of

It is a string of horrors Three days ago they brought here a man who
was supposed to be only attacked with cholera You have no doubt heard
speak of this personage He is the liontamer that drew all Paris to
the PorteSaintMartin

I know the man you mean Called Morok He performed a kind of play with
a tame panther

Exactly so I was myself present at a similar scene which a stranger
an Indian in consequence of a wager was said at the time jumped upon
the stage and killed the panther

Well this Morok brought here as a cholerapatient and indeed with
all the symptoms of the contagion soon showed signs of a still more
frightful malady

And this was

Hydrophobia

Did he become mad

Yes he confessed that he had been bitten a few days before by one
of the mastiffs in his menagerie unfortunately we only learnt this
circumstance after the terrible attack which cost the life of the poor
fellow we deplore

How did it happen then

Morok was in a room with three other patients Suddenly seized with a
sort of furious delirium he rose uttering ferocious cries and rushed
raving mad into the passage Our poor friend made an attempt to stop
him This kind of resistance increased the frenzy of Morok who threw
himself on the man that crossed his path and tearing him with his
teeth fell down in horrible convulsions

Oh you are right Twas indeed frightful And not withstanding every
assistance this victim of Moroks

Died during the night in dreadful agony for the shock had been so
violent that brainfever almost instantly declared itself

And is Morok dead

I do not know He was to be taken to another hospital after being fast
bound in the state of weakness which generally succeeds the fit But
till he can be removed he has been confined in a room upstairs

But he cannot recover

I should think he must be dead by this time The doctors did not give
him twentyfour hours to live

The persons engaged in this conversation were standing in an
antechamber on the groundfloor in which usually assembled those who
came to offer their voluntary aid to the sick One door of this room
communicated with the rest of the hospital and the other with the
passage that opened upon the courtyard

Dear me said one of the two speakers looking through the window
See what two charming girls have just got out of that elegant carriage
How much alike they are Such a resemblance is indeed extraordinary

No doubt they are twins Poor young girls dressed in Mourning They
have perhaps lost father or mother

One would imagine they are coming this way

Yes they are coming up the steps

And indeed Rose and Blanche soon entered the antechamber with a timid
anxious air though a sort of feverish excitement was visible in their
looks One of the two men that were talking together moved by the
embarrassment of the girls advanced toward them and said in a tone of
attentive politeness Is there anything I can do for you ladies

Is not this sir replied Rose the infirmary of the Rue du Mont
Blanc

Yes miss

A lady called Madame Augustine du Tremblay was brought here we are
told about two days ago Could we see her

I would observe to you miss that there is some danger in entering the
sickwards

It is a dear friend that we wish to see answered Rose in a mild and
firm tone which sufficiently expressed that she was determined to brave
the danger

I cannot be sure miss resumed the other that the person you seek
is here but if you will take the trouble to walk into this room on the
left you will find there the good Sister Martha she has the care
of the womens wards and will give you all the information you can
desire

Thank you sir said Blanche with a graceful bow and she and her
sister entered together the apartment which had been pointed out to
them

They are really charming said the man looking after the two sisters
who soon disappeared from his view It would be a great pity if

He was unable to finish A frightful tumult mingled with cries of alarm
and horror rose suddenly from the adjoining rooms Almost instantly
two doors were thrown open and a number of the sick halfnaked pale
fleshless and their features convulsed with terror rushed into the
antechamber exclaiming Help help the madman It is impossible to
paint the scene of despairing and furious confusion which followed this
panic of so many affrighted wretches flying to the only other door to
escape from the perils they dreaded and there struggling and trampling
on each other to pass through the narrow entrance

At the moment when the last of these unhappy creatures succeeded in
reaching the door dragging himself along upon his bleeding hands for
he had been thrown down and almost crushed in the confusionMorok
the object of so much terrorMorok himself appeared He was a horrible
sight With the exception of a rag bound about his middle his wan form
was entirely naked and from his bare legs still hung the remnants of
the cords he had just broken His thick yellow hair stood almost on
end his beard bristled his savage eyes rolled full of blood in their
orbits and shone with a glassy brightness his lips were covered with
foam from time to time he uttered hoarse guttural cries The veins
visible on his iron limbs were swollen almost to bursting He bounded
like a wild beast and stretched out before him his bony and quivering
hands At the moment Morok reached the doorway by which those he
pursued made their escape some persons attracted by the noise managed
to close this door from without whilst others secured that which
communicated with the sickward

Morok thus found himself a prisoner He ran to the window to force it
open and threw himself into the courtyard But stopping suddenly he
drew back from the glittering panes seized with that invincible horror
which all the victims of hydrophobia feel at the sight of any shining
object particularly glass The unfortunate creatures whom he had
pursued saw him from the courtyard exhausting himself in furious
efforts to open the doors that just had been closed upon him Then
perceiving the inutility of his attempts he uttered savage cries and
rushed furiously round the room like a wild beast that seeks in vain to
escape from its cage

But suddenly those spectators of this scene who had approached
nearest to the window uttered a loud exclamation of fear and anguish
Morok had perceived the little door which led to the closet occupied by
Sister Martha where Rose and Blanche had entered a few minutes before
Hoping to get out by this way Morok drew the door violently towards
him and succeeded in half opening it notwithstanding the resistance he
experienced from the inside For an instant the affrighted crowd saw the
stiffened arms Of Sister Martha and the orphans clinging to the door
and holding it back with all their might




CHAPTER LVI HYDROPHOBIA

When the sick people assembled in the courtyard saw the desperate
efforts of Morok to force the door of the room which contained Sister
Martha and the orphans their fright redoubled It is all over Sister
Martha cried they

The door will give way

And the closet has no other entrance

There are two young girls in mourning with her

Come we must not leave these poor women to encounter the madman
Follow me friends cried generously one of the spectators who was
still blessed with health and he rushed towards the steps to return to
the antechamber

Its too late its only exposing yourself in vain cried many
persons holding him back by force

At this moment voices were heard exclaiming Here is the Abbe
Gabriel

He is coming downstairs He has heard the noise

He is asking what is the matter

What will he do

Gabriel occupied with a dying person in a neighboring room had
indeed just learned that Morok having broken his bonds had succeeded
in escaping from the chamber in which he had been temporarily confined
Foreseeing the terrible dangers which might result from the escape of
the liontamer the missionary consulted only his courage and hastened
down in the hope of preventing greater misfortunes In obedience to
his orders an attendant followed him bearing a brazier full of hot
cinders on which lay several irons at a white heat used by the
doctors for cauterizing in desperate cases of cholera

The angelic countenance of Gabriel was very pale but calm intrepidity
shone upon his noble brow Hastily crossing the passage and making his
way through the crowd he went straight to the antechamber door As
he approached it one of the sick people said to him in a lamentable
voice Ah sir it is all over Those who can see through the window
say that Sister Martha is lost

Gabriel made no answer but grasped the key of the door Before entering
the room however he turned to the attendant and said to him in a firm
voice Are the irons of a white heat

Yes sir

Then wait here and be ready As for you my friends he added
turning to some of the sick who shuddered with terror as soon as
I enter shut the door after me I will answer for the rest And you
friend only bring your irons when I call

And the young missionary turned the key in the lock At this juncture
a cry of alarm pity and admiration rose from every lip and the
spectators drew back from the door with an involuntary feeling of
fear Raising his eyes to heaven as if to invoke its assistance at this
terrible moment Gabriel pushed open the door and immediately closed it
behind him He was alone with Morok

The liontamer by a last furious effort had almost succeeded in
opening the door to which Sister Martha and the orphans were clinging
in a fit of terror uttering piercing cries At the sound of Gabriels
footsteps Morok turned round suddenly Then instead of continuing
his attack on the closet he sprang with a roar and a bound upon the
newcomer

During this time Sister Martha and the orphans not knowing the
cause of the sudden retreat of their assailant took advantage of the
opportunity to close and bolt the door and thus placed themselves
in security from a new attack Morok with haggard eye and teeth
convulsively clinched had rushed upon Gabriel his hands extended
to seize him by the throat The missionary stood the shock valiantly
Guessing at a glance the intention of his adversary he seized him
by the wrists as he advanced and holding him back bent him down
violently with a vigorous hand For a second Morok and Gabriel remained
mute breathless motionless gazing on each other then the missionary
strove to conquer the efforts of the madman who with violent jerks
attempted to throw himself upon him and to seize and tear him with his
teeth

Suddenly the liontamers strength seemed to fail his knees quivered
his livid head sank upon his shoulder his eyes closed The missionary
supposing that a momentary weakness had succeeded to the fit of rage
and that the wretch was about to fall relaxed his hold in order to lend
him assistance But no sooner did he feel himself at liberty thanks
to his crafty device than Morok flung himself furiously upon Gabriel
Surprised by this sudden attack the latter stumbled and at once felt
himself clasped into the iron arms of the madman Yet with redoubled
strength and energy struggling breast to breast foot to foot the
missionary in his turn succeeded in tripping up his adversary and
throwing him with a vigorous effort again seized his hands and now
held him down beneath his knee Having thus completely mastered him
Gabriel turned his head to call for assistance when Morok by a
desperate strain succeeded in raising himself a little and seized with
his teeth the left arm of the missionary At this sharp deep horrible
bite which penetrated to the very bone Gabriel could not restrain a
scream of anguish and horror He strove in vain to disengage himself
for his arm was held fast as in a vice between the firmset jaws of
Morok

This frightful scene had lasted less time than it has taken in the
description when suddenly the door leading to the passage was violently
opened and several courageous men who had learned from the patients
to what danger the young priest was exposed came rushing to his
assistance in spite of his recommendation not to enter till he should
call The attendant was amongst the number with the brazier and the hot
irons Gabriel as soon as he perceived him said to him in an agitated
voice Quick friend your iron Thank God I had thought of that

One of the men who had entered the room was luckily provided with a
blanket and the moment the missionary succeeded in wresting his arm
from the clinched teeth of Morok whom he still held down with his knee
this blanket was thrown over the madmans head so that he could now be
held and bound without danger notwithstanding his desperate resistance
Then Gabriel rose tore open the sleeve of his cassock and laying bare
his left arm on which a deep bite was visible bleeding of a bluish
color he beckoned the attendant to draw near seized one of the hot
irons and with a firm and sure hand twice applied the burning metal
to the wound with a calm heroism which struck all the spectators with
admiration But soon so many various emotions intrepidly sustained
were followed by a natural reaction Large drops of sweat stood upon
Gabriels brow his long light hair clung to his temples he grew deadly
pale reeled lost his senses and was carried into the next room to
receive immediate attention

An accidental circumstance likely enough to occur had converted one
of the Princess de SaintDiziers falsehoods into a truth To induce
the orphans to go to the hospital she had told them Gabriel was there
which at the time she was far from believing On the contrary she would
have wished to prevent a meeting which from the attachment of the
missionary to the girls might interfere with her projects A little
while after the terrible scene we have just related Rose and Blanche
accompanied by Sister Martha entered a vast room of a strange and
fatal aspect containing a number of women who had suddenly been seized
with cholera

These immense apartments generously supplied for the purpose of a
temporary hospital had been furnished with excessive luxury The room
now occupied by the sick women of whom we speak had been used for
a ballroom The white panels glittered with sumptuous gilding and
magnificent pierglasses occupied the spaces between the windows
through which could be seen the fresh verdure of a pleasant garden
smiling beneath the influence of budding May In the midst of all
this gilded luxury on a rich inlaid floor of costly woods were seen
arranged in regular order four rows of beds of every shape and kind
from the humble trucklebed to the handsome couch in carved mahogany

This long room was divided into two compartments by a temporary
partition four or five feet in height They had thus been able to
manage the four rows of beds This partition finished at some little
distance from either end of the room so as to leave an open space
without beds for the volunteer attendants when the sick did not
require their aid At one of these extremities of the room was a lofty
and magnificent marble chimney piece ornamented with gilt bronze
On the fire beneath various drinks were brewing for the patients To
complete the singular picture women of every class took their turns in
attending upon the sick to whose sighs and groans they always responded
with consoling words of hope and pity Such was the place strange and
mournful that Rose and Blanche entered together hand in hand a short
time after Gabriel had displayed such heroic courage in the struggle
against Morok Sister Martha accompanied Marshal Simons daughters
After speaking a few words to them in a whisper she pointed out to them
the two divisions in which the beds were arranged and herself went to
the other end of the room to give some orders

The orphans still under the impression of the terrible danger from
which Gabriel had rescued them without their knowing it were both
excessively pale yet their eyes were expressive of firm resolution
They had determined not only to perform what they considered an
imperative duty but to prove themselves worthy of their valiant father
they were acting too for their mothers sake since they had been told
that dying in Siberia without receiving the sacrament her eternal
felicity might depend on the proofs they gave of Christian devotion
Need we add that the Princess de SaintDizier following the advice of
Rodin had in a second interview skillfully brought about without the
knowledge of Dagobert taken advantage of the excitable qualities
of these poor confiding simple and generous souls by a fatal
exaggeration of the most noble and courageous sentiments The orphans
having asked Sister Martha if Madame Augustine du Tremblay had been
brought to this asylum within the last three days that person had
answered that she really did not know but if they would go through
the womens wards it would be easy for them to ascertain For the
abominable hypocrite who in conjunction with Rodin had sent these
two children to encounter a mortal peril had told an impudent falsehood
when she affirmed that their governess had been removed to this
hospital During their exile and their toilsome journey with Dagobert
the sisters had been exposed to many hard trials But never had they
witnessed so sad a spectacle as that which now offered itself to their
view

The long row of beds on which so many poor creatures writhed in agony
some uttering deep groans some only a dull rattle in the throat some
raving in the delirium of fever or calling on those from whom they were
about to part foreverthese frightful sights and sounds which are
too much even for brave men would inevitably such was the execrable
design of Rodin and his accomplices make a fatal impression on these
young girls urged by the most generous motives to undertake this
perilous visit And thensad memory which awoke in all its deep and
poignant bitterness by the side of the first beds they came toit was
of this very malady the Cholera that their mother had died a painful
death Fancy the twins entering this vast room of so fearful an
aspect and already much shaken by the terror which Morok had inspired
pursuing their search in the midst of these unfortunate creatures whose
dying pangs reminded them every instant of the dying agony of their
mother For a moment at sight of the funeral hall Rose and Blanche had
felt their resolution fail them A black presentiment made them regret
their heroic imprudence and moreover since several minutes they had
begun to feel an icy shudder and painful shootings across the temples
but attributing these symptoms to the fright occasioned by Morok their
good and valiant natures soon stifled all these fears They exchanged
glances of affection their courage revived and both of themRose
on one side of the partition and Blanche on the otherproceeded with
their painful task Gabriel carried to the doctors private room had
soon recovered his senses Thanks to his courage and presence of mind
his wound cauterized in time could have no dangerous consequences
As soon as it was dressed he insisted on returning to the womens ward
where he had be offering pious consolations to a dying person at the
moment they had come to inform him of the frightful danger caused by the
escape of Morok

A few minutes before the missionary entered the room Rose and Blanche
arrived almost together at the term of their mournful search one from
the left the other from the righthand row of beds separated by the
partition which divided the hall into compartments The sisters had not
yet seen each other Their steps tottered as they advanced and they
were forced from time to time to lean against the beds as they passed
along Their strength wasrapidly failing them Giddy with fear and
pain they appeared to act almost mechanically Alas the orphans had
been seized almost at the same moment with the terrible symptoms of
cholera In consequence of that species of physiological phenomenon of
which we have already spokena phenomenon by no means rare in twins
which had already been displayed on one or two occasions of their
sicknesstheir organizations seemed liable to the same sensations the
same simultaneous accidents like two flowers on one stem which bloom
and fade together The sight of so much suffering and so many deaths
had accelerated the development of this dreadful disease Already on
their agitated and altered countenances they bore the mortal tokens of
the contagion as they came forth each on her own side from the
two subdivisions of the room in which they had vainly sought their
governess Until now separated by the partition Rose and Blanche had
not yet seen each other but when at length their eyes met there
ensued a heart rending scene




CHAPTER LVII THE GUARDIAN ANGEL

To the charming freshness of the sisters faces had succeeded a livid
pallor Their large blue eyes now hollow and sunk in appeared of
enormous dimensions Their lips once so rosy were now suffused with a
violet hue and a similar color was gradually displacing the transparent
carmine of their cheeks and fingers It was as if all the roses in their
charming countenances were fading and turning blue before the icy blast
of death

When the orphans met tottering and hardly able to sustain themselves
a cry of mutual horror burst from their lips Each of them exclaimed at
sight of the fearful change in her sisters features Are you also ill
sister And then bursting into tears they threw themselves into each
others arms and looked anxiously at one another

Good heaven Rose how pale you are

Like you sister

And do you feel a cold shudder

Yes and my sight fails me

My bosom is all on fire

Sister we are perhaps going to die

Let it only be together

And our poor father

And Dagobert

Sister our dream has come true cried Rose almost deliriously as
she threw her arms round Blanches neck Look look the Angel Gabriel
is here to fetch us

Indeed at this moment Gabriel entered the open space at the end of the
room Heaven what do I see cried the young priest The daughters of
Marshal Simon

And rushing forward he received the sisters in his arms for they were
no longer able to stand Already their drooping heads their halfclosed
eyes their painful and difficult breathing announced the approach of
death Sister Martha was close at hand She hastened to respond to the
call of Gabriel Aided by this pious woman he was able to lift the
orphans upon a bed reserved for the doctor in attendance For fear that
the sight of this mournful agony should make too deep an impression on
the other patients Sister Martha drew a large curtain and the sisters
were thus in some sort walled off from the rest of the room Their hands
had been so tightly clasped together during a nervous paroxysm that it
was impossible to separate them It was in this position that the first
remedies were appliedremedies incapable of conquering the violence
of the disease but which at least mitigated for a few moments the
excessive pains they suffered and restored some faint glimmer of
perception to their obscured and troubled senses At this moment
Gabriel was leaning over the bed with a look of inexpressible grief
With breaking heart and face bathed in tears he thought of the strange
destiny which thus made him a witness of the death of these girls his
relations whom but a few months before he had rescued from the horrors
of the tempest In spite of his firmness of soul the missionary could
not help shuddering as he reflected on the fate of the orphans the
death of Jacques Rennepont and the fearful devices by which M Hardy
retired to the cloistered solitude of St Herein had become a member
of the Society of Jesus almost in dying The missionary said to himself
that already four members of the Rennepont familyhis familyhad been
successively struck down by some dreadful fate and he asked himself
with alarm how it was that the detestable interests of the Society of
Loyola should be served by a providential fatality The astonishment of
the young missionary would have given place to the deepest horror could
he have known the part that Rodin and his accomplices had taken both
in the death of Jacques Rennepont by exciting through Morok the evil
propensities of the artisan and in the approaching end of Rose and
Blanche by converting through the Princess de SaintDizier the
generous inspirations of the orphans into suicidal heroism

Roused for a moment from the painful stupor in which they had been
plunged Rose and Blanche halfopened their large eyes already dull
and faded Then more and more bewildered they both gazed fixedly at the
angelic countenance of Gabriel

Sister said Rose in a faint voice do you see the archangelas in
our dreams in Germany

Yesthree days agohe appeared to us

He is come to fetch us

Alas will our death save our poor mother from purgatory

Angel blessed angel pray God for our motherand for us Until
now stupefied with amazement and sorrow almost suffocated with sobs
Gabriel had not been able to utter a word But at these words of the
orphans he exclaimed Dear children why doubt of your mothers
salvation Oh never did a purer soul ascend to its Creator Your
mother I know from my adopted father that her virtues and courage
were the admiration of all who knew her Oh believe me God has blessed
her

Do you hear sister cried Rose as a ray of celestial joy illumined
for an instant the livid faces of the orphans God has blessed our
mother

Yes yes resumed Gabriel banish these gloomy ideas Take courage
poor children You must not die Think of your father

Our father said Blanche shuddering and she continued with a
mixture of reason and wild excitement which would have touched the
soul of the most indifferent Alas he will not find us on his return
Forgive us father we did not think to do any harm We wished like
you to do something generousto help our governess

And we did not think to die so quickly and so soon Yesterday we were
gay and happy

Oh good angel you will appear to our father even as you have
appeared to us You will tell him that in dyingthe last thought of
his childrenwas of him

We came here without Dagoberts knowing itdo not let our father scold
him

Blessed angel resumed the other sister in a still more feeble voice
appear to Dagobert also Tell him that we ask his forgiveness for
the grief our death will occasion him

And let our old friend caress our poor Spoilsport for usour faithful
guardian added Blanche trying to smile

And then resumed Rose in a voice that was growing still fainter
promise to appear to two other persons that have been so kind to
usgood Mother Bunchand the beautiful Lady Adrienne

We forget none whom we have loved said Blanche with a last effort
Now God grant we may go to our mother never to leave her more

You promised it good angelyou know you didin the dream You said
to us Poor childrencome from so faryou will have traversed the
earthto rest on the maternal bosom

Oh it is dreadfuldreadful So youngand no hope murmured Gabriel
as he buried his face in his hands Almighty Father Thy views are
impenetrable Alas yet why should these children die this cruel death

Rose heaved a deep sigh and said in an expiring tone Let us be buried
togetherunited in life in death not divided

And the two turned their dying looks upon Gabriel and stretched out
towards him their supplicating hands

Oh blessed martyrs to a generous devotion cried the missionary
raising to heaven his eyes streaming with tears Angelic souls
treasures of innocence and truth ascend ascend to heavensince God
calls you to him and the earth is not worthy to possess you

Sister father were the last words that the orphans pronounced with
their dying voices

And then the twins by a last instinctive impulse endeavored to clasp
each other and their eyes halfopened to exchange yet another glance
They shuddered twice or thrice their limbs stiffened a deep sigh
struggled from their violetcolored lips Rose and Blanche were both
dead Gabriel and Sister Martha after closing the eyes of the orphans
knelt down to pray by the side of that funeral couch Suddenly a
great tumult was heard in the room Rapid footsteps mingled with
imprecations sounded close at hand the curtain was drawn aside from
this mournful scene and Dagobert entered precipitately pale haggard
his dress in disorder At sight of Gabriel and the Sister of Charity
kneeling beside the corpses of his children the soldier uttered a
terrible roar and tried to advancebut in vainfor before Gabriel
could reach him Dagobert fell flat on the ground and his gray head
struck violently on the floor

It is nighta dark and stormy night One oclock in the morning has
just sounded from the church of Montmartre It is to the cemetery of
Montmartre that is carried the coffin which according to the last
wishes of Rose and Blanche contains them both Through the thick shadow
which rests upon that field of death may be seen moving a pale light
It is the gravedigger He advances with caution a dark lantern is in
his hand A man wrapped in a cloak accompanies him He holds down his
head and weeps It is Samuel The old Jewthe keeper of the house
in the Rue SaintFrancois On the night of the funeral of Jacques
Rennepont the first who died of the seven heirs and who was buried
in another cemetery Samuel had a similar mysterious interview with the
gravedigger to obtain a favor at the price of gold A strange and awful
favor After passing down several paths bordered with cypress trees by
the side of many tombs the Jew and the gravedigger arrived at a little
glade situated near the western wall of the cemetery The night was so
dark that scarcely anything could be seen After moving his lantern up
and down and all about the gravedigger showed Samuel at the foot of a
tall yewtree with long black branches a little mound of newlyraised
earth and said It is here

You are sure of it

Yes yestwo bodies in one coffin it is not such a common thing

Alas two in the same coffin said the Jew with a deep sigh

Now that you know the place what do you want more asked the
gravedigger

Samuel did not answer He fell on his knees and piously kissed
the little mound Then rising with his cheeks bathed in tears he
approached the gravedigger and spoke to him for some moments in a
whisperthough they were alone and in the centre of that deserted
place Then began between those two men a mysterious dialogue which the
night enveloped in shade and silence The gravedigger alarmed at what
Samuel asked him at first refused his request

But the Jew employing persuasions entreaties tears and at last the
seduction of the jingling gold succeeded in conquering the scruples of
the gravedigger Though the latter trembled at the thought of what he
promised he said to Samuel in an agitated tone Tomorrow night then
at two oclock

I shall be behind the wall answered Samuel pointing out the place
with the aid of a lantern I will throw three stones into the cemetery
for a signal

Yes three stonesas a signal replied the gravedigger shuddering
and wiping the cold sweat from his forehead

With considerable remains of vigor notwithstanding his great age
Samuel availed himself of the broken surface of the low wall and
climbing over it soon disappeared The gravedigger returned home with
hasty strides From time to time he looked fearfully behind him as
though he had been pursued by some fatal vision

On the evening after the funeral of Rose and Blanche Rodin wrote two
letters The first addressed to his mysterious correspondent at Rome
alluded to the deaths of Jacques Rennepont and Rose and Blanche Simon
as well as to the cession of M Hardys property and the donation
of Gabrielevents which reduced the claimants of the inheritance to
twoMdlle de Cardoville and Djalma This first note written by Rodin
for Rome contained only the following words Five from seven leaves
two Announce this result to the CardinalPrince Let him go on I
advance advanceadvance The second note in a feigned hand was
addressed to Marshal Simon to be delivered by a sure messenger
contained these few lines If there is yet time make haste to return
Your daughters are both dead You shall learn who killed them




CHAPTER LVIII RUIN

It is the day after the death of Marshal Simons daughters Mdlle de
Cardoville is yet ignorant of the sad end of her young relatives Her
countenance is radiant with happiness and never has she looked more
beautiful her eye has never been more brilliant her complexion more
dazzling white her lip of a richer coral According to her somewhat
eccentric custom of dressing herself in her own house in a picturesque
style Adrienne wears today though it is about three oclock in the
afternoon a pale green wateredsilk dress with a very full skirt the
sleeves and bodice slashed with rosecolored ribbon and adorned with
white buglebeads of exquisite workmanship while a slender network
also of white buglebeads concealing the thick plait of Adriennes
back hair forms an oriental headdress of charming originality and
contrasts agreeably with the long curls which fall in front almost to
the swell of the bosom To the expression of indescribable happiness
which marks the features of Mdlle de Cardoville is added a certain
resolute cutting satirical air which is not habitual to her Her
charming head and graceful swanlike neck are raised in an attitude
of defiance her small rosecolored nostrils seem to dilate with
illrepressed ardor and she waits with haughty impatience for the
moment of an aggressive and ironical interview Not far from Adrienne is
Mother Bunch She has resumed in the house the place which she at first
occupied The young sempstress is in mourning for her sister but her
countenance is expressive of a mild calm sorrow She looks at Mdlle de
Cardoville with surprise for never till now has she seen the features
of the fair patrician impressed with such a character of ironical
audacity Mdlle de Cardoville was exempt from the slightest coquetry
in the narrow and ordinary sense of the word Yet she now cast an
inquiring look at the glass before which she was standing and having
restored the elastic smoothness to one of her long golden curls by
rolling it for a moment round her ivory finger she carefully effaced
with her hands some almost imperceptible folds which had formed
themselves in the thick material of her elegant corsage This movement
and that of turning her back to the glass to see if her dress sat
perfectly on all points revealed in serpentine undulations all the
charms and graces of her light and elegant figure for in spite of the
rich fulness of her shoulders white and firm as sculptured alabaster
Adrienne belonged to that class of privileged persons who are able at
need to make a girdle out of a garter

Having performed with indescribable grace these charming evolutions of
feminine coquetry Adrienne turned towards Mother Bunch whose surprise
was still on the increase and said to her smiling My dear Magdalen
do not laugh at my questionbut what would you say to a picture that
should represent me as I am now

Why lady

There you are again with your ladying said Adrienne in a tone of
gentle reproach

Well then Adrienne resumed Mother Bunch I think it would be a
charming picture for you are dressed as usual with perfect taste

But am I not better dressed than on other days my dear poetess I
began by telling you that I do not ask the question for my own sake
said Adrienne gayly

Well I suppose so replied Mother Bunch with a faint smile It is
certainly impossible to imagine anything that would suit you better The
light green and the pale rosecolor with the soft lustre of the white
ornaments harmonize so well with your golden hair that I cannot
conceive I tell you a more graceful picture

The speaker felt what she said and she was happy to be able to express
it for we know the intense admiration of that poetic soul for all that
was beautiful

Well went on Adrienne gayly I am glad my dear that you find me
better dressed than usual

Only said the hunchback hesitating

Only repeated Adrienne looking at her with an air of interrogation

Why only continued the other if I have never seen you look more
pretty I have also never observed in your features the resolute and
ironical expression which they had just now It was like an air of
impatient defiance

And so it was my dear little Magdalen said Adrienne throwing her
arms round the girls neck with joyous tenderness I must kiss you for
having guessed it You see I expect a visit from my dear aunt

The Princess de SaintDizier cried Mother Bunch in alarm That
wicked lady who did you so much evil

The very same She has asked for an interview and I shall be delighted
to receive her

Delighted

Yesa somewhat ironical and malicious delight it is true answered
Adrienne still more gayly You shall judge for yourself She regrets
her gallantries her beauty her youtheven her size afflicts the
holy womanand she will see me young fair belovedand above all
thinyes thin added Mdlle de Cardoville laughing merrily And you
may imagine my dear how much envy and despair the sight of a young
thin woman excites in a stout one of a certain age

My friend said Mother Bunch gravely you speak in jest And yet I
know not why the coming of this princess alarms me

Dear gentle soul be satisfied answered Adrienne affectionately I
do not fear this womanI no longer have any fear of herand to prove
it to her confusion I will treat hera monster of hypocrisy and
wickedness who comes here no doubt on some abominable designI will
treat her as an inoffensive ridiculous fat woman And Adrienne again
laughed

A servant here entered the room and interrupted the mirth of Adrienne
by saying The Princess de SaintDizier wishes to know if you can
receive her

Certainly said Mdlle de Cardoville and the servant retired Mother
Bunch was about to rise and quit the room but Adrienne held her back
and said to her taking her hand with an air of serious tenderness
Stay my dear friend I entreat you

Do you wish it

Yes I wishstill in revenge you know said Adrienne with a smile
to prove to her highness of SaintDizier that I have an affectionate
friendthat I have in fact every happiness

But Adrienne replied the other timidly consider

Silence here is the princess Remain I ask it as a favor The
instinct of your heart will discover any snare she may have laid Did
not your affection warn me of the plots of Rodin

Mother Bunch could not refuse such a request She remained but was
about to draw back from the fireplace Adrienne however took her by
the hand and made her resume her seat in the armchair saying My
dear Magdalen keep your place You owe nothing to the lady With me it
is different she comes to my house

Hardly had Adrienne uttered these words than the princess entered with
head erect and haughty air we have said she could carry herself most
loftily and advanced with a firm step The strongest minds have their
side of puerile weakness a savage envy excited by the elegance wit
and beauty of Adrienne bore a large part in the hatred of the princess
for her niece and though it was idle to think of eclipsing Adrienne
and the Princess de SaintDizier did not seriously mean to attempt it
she could not forbear in preparing for the interview she had demanded
taking more pains even than usual in the arrangement of her dress
Beneath her robe of shot silk she was laced in and tightened to
excessa pressure which considerably increased the color in her cheeks
The throng of jealous and hateful sentiments which inspired her with
regard to Adrienne had so troubled the clearness of her ordinarily calm
judgment that instead of the plain and quiet style in which as a
woman of tact and taste she was generally attired she now committed
the folly of wearing a dress of changing hues and a crimson hat
adorned with a magnificent bird of paradise Hate envy the pride of
triumphfor she thought of the skillful perfidy with which she had
sent to almost certain death the daughters of Marshal Simonand the
execrable hope of succeeding in new plots were all expressed in the
countenance of the Princess de SaintDizier as she entered her nieces
apartment

Without advancing to meet her aunt Adrienne rose politely from the sofa
on which she was seated made a halfcurtsey full of grace and dignity
and immediately resumed her former posture Then pointing to an arm
chair near the fireplace at one corner of which sat Mother Bunch and
she herself at the other she said Pray sit down your highness
The princess turned very red remained standing and cast a disdainful
glance of insolent surprise at the sempstress who in compliance with
Adriennes wish only bowed slightly at the entrance of the Princess de
SaintDizier without offering to give up her place In acting thus the
young sempstress followed the dictates of her conscience which told her
that the real superiority did not belong to this base hypocritical and
wicked princess but rather to such a person as herself the admirable
and devoted friend

Let me beg your highness to sit down resumed Adrienne in a mild
tone as she pointed to the vacant chair

The interview I have demanded niece said the princess must be a
private one

I have no secrets madame from my best friend you may speak in the
presence of this young lady

I have long known replied Madame de SaintDizier with bitter irony
that in all things you care little for secrecy and that you are easy
in the choice of what you call your friends But you will permit me to
act differently from you If you have no secrets madame I haveand I
do not choose to confide them to the first comer

So saying the pious lady glanced contemptuously at the sempstress The
latter hurt at the insolent tone of the princess answered mildly and
simply

I do not see what can be the great difference between the first and the
last comer to Mdlle de Cardovilles

What can it speak cried the princess insolently

It can at least answer madame replied Mother Bunch in her calm
voice

I wish to see you alone nieceis that clear said the princess
impatiently to her niece

I beg your pardon but I do not quite understand your highness said
Adrienne with an air of surprise This young lady who honors me with
her friendship is willing to be present at this interview which you
have asked forI say she has consented to be present for it needs
I confess the kindest condescension in her to resign herself from
affection for me to hear all the graceful obliging and charming
things which you have no doubt come hither to communicate

Madame began the princess angrily

Permit me to interrupt your highness returned Adrienne in a tone
of perfect amenity as if she were addressing the most flattering
compliments to her visitor To put you quite at your ease with the lady
here I will begin by informing you that she is quite aware of all the
holy perfidies pious wrongs and devout infamies of which you nearly
made me the victim She knows that you are a mother of the Church such
as one sees but few of in these days May I hope therefore that your
highness will dispense with this delicate and interesting reserve

Really said the princess with a sort of incensed amazement I
scarcely know if I wake or sleep

Dear me said Adrienne in apparent alarm this doubt as to the state
of your faculties is very shocking madame I see that the blood flies
to your head for your face sufficiently shows it you seem oppressed
confined uncomfortableperhaps we women may say so between
ourselves perhaps you are laced a little too tightly madame

These words pronounced by Adrienne with an air of warm interest and
perfect simplicity almost choked the princess with rage She became
crimson seated herself abruptly and exclaimed Be it so madame I
prefer this reception to any other It puts me at my ease as you say

Does it indeed madame said Adrienne with a smile You may now at
least speak frankly all that you feel which must for you have the charm
of novelty Confess that you are obliged to me for enabling you even
for a moment to lay aside that mask of piety amiability and goodness
which must be so troublesome to you

As she listened to the sarcasms of Adrienne an innocent and excusable
revenge if we consider all the wrongs she had suffered Mother Bunch
felt her heart sink within her for she dreaded the malignity of the
princess who replied with the utmost calmness A thousand thanks
madame for your excellent intentions and sentiments I appreciate them
as I ought and I hope in a short time to prove it to you

Well madame said Adrienne playfully let us have it all at once I
am full of impatient curiosity

And yet said the princess feigning in her turn a bitter and ironical
delight you are far from having the least notion of what I am about to
announce to you

Indeed I fear that your highnesss candor and modesty deceive you
replied Adrienne with the same mocking affability for there are very
few things on your part that can surprise me madame You must be aware
that from your highness I am prepared for anything

Perhaps madame said the princess laying great stress on her
words if for instance I were to tell you that within twentyfour
hourssuppose between this and tomorrowthou will be reduced to
poverty

This was so unexpected that Mdlle de Cardoville started in spite of
herself and Mother Bunch shuddered

Ah madame said the princess with triumphant joy and cruel mildness
as she watched the growing surprise of her niece confess that I have
astonished you a little You were right in giving to our interview the
turn it has taken I should have needed all sorts of circumlocution to
say to you Niece tomorrow you will be as poor as you are rich to
day But now I can tell you the fact quite plainly and simply

Recovering from her first amazement Adrienne replied with a calm
smile which checked the joy of the princess Well I confess frankly
madame that you have surprised me I expected from you one of those
black pieces of malignity one of those welllaid plots in which you
are known to excel and I did not think you would make all this fuss
about such a trifle

To be ruinedcompletely ruined cried the princess and that by to
morrowyou that have been so prodigal will see your house furniture
horses jewels even the ridiculous dresses of which you are so vain
all taken from youdo you call that a trifle You that spend with
indifference thousands of louis will be reduced to a pension inferior
to the wages you gave your footboydo you call that a trifle

To her aunts cruel disappointment Adrienne who appeared quite to have
recovered her serenity was about to answer accordingly when the door
suddenly opened and without being announced Prince Djalma entered the
room A proud and tender expression of delight beamed from the radiant
brow of Adrienne at sight of the prince and it is impossible to
describe the look of triumphant happiness and high disdain that she cast
upon the Princess de SaintDizier Djalma himself had never looked more
handsome and never had more intense happiness been impressed on a human
countenance The Hindoo wore a long robe of white Cashmere adorned with
innumerable stripes of gold and purple his turban was of the same color
and material a magnificent figured shawl was twisted about his waist
On seeing the Indian whom she had not hoped to meet at Mdlle de
Cardovilles the Princess de SaintDizier could not at first conceal
her extreme surprise It was between these four then that the
following scene took place




CHAPTER LIX MEMORIES

Djalma having never before met the Princess de SaintDizier at
Adriennes at first appeared rather astonished at her presence The
princess keeping silence for a moment contemplated with implacable
hatred and envy those two beings both so fair and young so loving and
happy Suddenly she started as if she had just remembered something of
great importance and for some seconds she remained absorbed in thought

Adrienne and Djalma availed themselves of this interval to gaze fondly
on each other with a sort of ardent idolatry which filled their eyes
with sweet tears Then at a movement of the Princess de SaintDizier
who seemed to rouse herself from her momentary trance Mdlle de
Cardoville said to the young prince with a smile My dear cousin I
have to repair an omission voluntary I confess and for good reasons
in never having before mentioned to you one of my relations whom I have
now the honor to present to you The Princess de SaintDizier

Djalma bowed but Mdlle de Cardoville resumed just as her aunt was
about to make some reply Her Highness of SaintDizier came very kindly
to inform me of an event which is a most fortunate one for me and of
which I will speak to you hereafter cousinunless this amiable
lady should wish to deprive me of the pleasure of making such a
communication

The unexpected arrival of the prince and the recollections which had
suddenly occurred to the princess had no doubt greatly modified her
first plans for instead of continuing the conversation with regard
to Adriennes threatened loss of fortune the princess answered with a
bland smile that covered an odious meaning I should be sorry prince
to deprive my dear and amiable niece of the pleasure of announcing to
you the happy news to which she alludes and which as a near relative
I lost no time in communicating to her I have here some notes on this
subject added the princess delivering a paper to Adrienne which I
hope will prove to her entire satisfaction the reality of what I have
announced to her

A thousand thanks my dear aunt said Adrienne receiving the paper
with perfect indifference these precautions and proofs are quite
superfluous You know that I always believe you on your word when it
concerns your good feeling towards myself

Notwithstanding his ignorance of the refined perfidy and cruel
politeness of civilized life Djalma endowed with a tact and fineness
of perception common to most natures of extreme susceptibility felt
some degree of mental discomfort as he listened to this exchange of
false compliments He could not guess their full meaning but they
sounded hollow to his ear and moreover whether from instinct or
presentiment he had conceived a vague dislike for the Princess de
SaintDizier That pious lady full of the great affair in hand was a
prey to the most violent agitation which betrayed itself in the growing
color of her cheeks her bitter smile and the malicious brightness of
her glance As he gazed on this woman Djalma was unable to conquer
his rising antipathy and he remained silent and attentive whilst his
handsome countenance lost something of its former serenity Mother Bunch
also felt the influence of a painful impression She glanced in terror
at the princess and then imploringly at Adrienne as though she
entreated the latter to but an end to an interview of which the young
sempstress foresaw the fatal consequences But unfortunately the
Princess de SaintDizier was too much interested in prolonging this
conversation and Mdlle de Cardoville gathering new courage and
confidence from the presence of the man she adored took delight in
vexing the princess with the exhibition of their happy love

After a short silence the Princess de SaintDizier observed in a soft
and insinuating tone Really prince you cannot think how pleased I
was to learn by public report for people talk of nothing else and
with good reason of your chivalrous attachment to my dear niece for
without knowing it you will extricate me from a difficult position

Djalma made no answer but he looked at Mdlle de Cardoville with a
surprised and almost sorrowful air as if to ask what her aunt meant to
insinuate

The latter not perceiving this mute interrogation resumed as follows
I will express myself more clearly prince You can understand that
being the nearest relative of this dear obstinate girl I am more or
less responsible for her conduct in the eyes of the world and you
prince seem just to have arrived on purpose from the end of the
earth to take charge of a destiny which had caused me considerable
apprehension It is charming it is excellent and I know not which
most to admire your courage or your good fortune The princess threw a
glance of diabolical malice at Adrienne and awaited her answer with an
air of defiance

Listen to our good aunt my dear cousin said the young lady smiling
calmly Since our affectionate kinswoman sees you and me united and
happy her heart is swelling with such a flood of joy that it must run
over and the effects will be delightful Only have a little patience
and you will behold them in their full beauty I do not know
added Adrienne in the most natural tone why in thinking of these
outpourings of our dear aunts affection I should remember what you
told me cousin of a certain viper in your country which sometimes
in a powerless bite breaks its fangs and absorbing its own venom
becomes the victim of the poison it distills Come my dear aunt you
that had so good and noble a heart I am sure you must feel interested
in the fate of those poor vipers

The princess darted an implacable look at her niece and replied in an
agitated voice I do not see the object of this selection of natural
history Do you prince

Djalma made no answer leaning with his arm on the mantelpiece he threw
dark and piercing glances upon the princess His involuntary hatred of
this woman filled his heart

Ah my dear aunt resumed Adrienne in a tone of selfreproach have
I presumed too much on the goodness of your heart Have you not even
sympathy for vipers For whom then have you any After all I can very
well understand it added Adrienne as if to herself vipers are so
thin But to lay aside these follies she continued gayly as she
saw the illrepressed rage of the pious woman tell us at once my dear
aunt all the tender things which the sight of our happiness inspires

I hope to do so my amiable niece First I must congratulate this dear
prince on having come so far to take charge in all confidence and
with his eyes shut of you my poor child whom we were obliged to
confine as mad in order to give a decent color to your excesses You
remember the handsome lad that we found in your apartment You cannot
be so faithless as already to have forgotten his name He was a fine
youth and a poetone Agricola Baudoinand was discovered in a secret
place attached to your bedchamber All Paris was amused with the
scandalfor you are not about to marry an unknown person dear prince
her name has been in every mouth

At these unexpected and dreadful words Adrienne Djalma and Mother
Bunch though under the influence of different kinds of resentment
remained for a moment mute with surprise and the princess judging it
no longer necessary to repress her infernal joy and triumphant hatred
exclaimed as she rose from her seat with flushed cheek and flashing
eyes Yes I defy you to contradict me Were we not forced to confine
you on the plea of madness And did we not find a workman your lover
concealed in your bedroom

On this horrible accusation Djalmas golden complexion transparent as
amber became suddenly the color of lead his eyes fixed and staring
showed the white round the pupilhis upper lip red as blood
was curled in a kind of wild convulsion which exposed to view the
firmlyset teethand his whole countenance became so frightfully
threatening and ferocious that Mother Bunch shuddered with terror
Carried away by the ardor of his blood the young Oriental felt a sort
of dizzy unreflecting involuntary ragea fiery commotion like that
which makes the blood leap to the brave mans eyes and brain when he
feels a blow upon his face If during that moment rapid as the passage
of the lightning through the cloud action could have taken the place of
thought the princess and Adrienne Mother Bunch and himself would all
have been annihilated by an explosion as sudden and fatal as that of
the bursting of a mine He would have killed the princess because she
accused Adrienne of infamous deception he would have killed Adrienne
because she could even be suspected of such infamyand Mother Bunch
for being a witness of the accusationand himself in order not to
survive such horrid treachery But oh wonder his furious and bloodshot
gaze met the calm look of Adriennea look so full of dignity and serene
confidenceand the expression of ferocious rage passed away like a
flash of lightning

Much more to the great surprise of the princess and the young workgirl
as the glances which Djalma cast upon Adrienne went as it were deeper
into that pure soul not only did the Indian grow calm but by a
kind of transfiguration his countenance seemed to borrow her serene
expression and reflect as in a mirror the noble serenity impressed
on the young ladys features Let us explain physically this moral
revolution as consoling to the terrified workgirl as provoking to the
princess Hardly had the princess distilled the atrocious calumny from
her venomous lips than Djalma then standing before the fireplace had
in the first paroxysm of his fury advanced a step towards her
but wishing as it were to moderate his rage he held by the marble
chimneypiece which he grasped with iron strength A convulsive
trembling shook his whole body and his features altered and
contracted became almost frightful Adrienne on her part when she
heard the accusation yielding to a first impulse of just indignation
even as Djalma had yielded to one of blind fury rose abruptly with
offended pride flashing from her eyes but almost immediately appeased
by the consciousness of her own purity her charming face resumed its
expression of adorable serenity It was then that her eyes met Djalmas
For a second the young lady was even more afflicted than terrified
at the threatening and formidable expression of the young Indians
countenance Can stupid indignity exasperate him to this degree said
Adrienne to herself Does he suspect me then

But to this reflection as rapid as it was painful succeeded the most
lively joy when the eyes of Adrienne rested for a short time on those
of the Indian and she saw his agitated countenance grow calm as if
by magic and become radiant and beautiful as before Thus was the
abominable plot of the princess de SaintDizier utterly confounded by
the sincere and confiding expression of Adriennes face That was not
all At the moment when as a spectator of this mute and expressive
scene which proved so well the wondrous sympathy of those two beings
who without speaking a word had understood and satisfied each other
the princess was choking with rage and vexationAdrienne with a
charming smile and gesture extended her fair hand to Djalma who
kneeling imprinted on it a kiss of fire which sent a light blush to
the forehead of the young lady

Then the Hindoo placing himself on the ermine carpet at the feet of
Mdlle de Cardoville in an attitude full of grace and respect rested
his chin on the palm of one of his hands and gazed on her silently in
a sort of mute adorationwhile Adrienne bending over him with a happy
smile looked at the babies in his eyes as the song says with as much
amorous complacency as if the hateful princess had not been present
But soon as if something were wanting to complete her happiness
Adrienne beckoned to Mother Bunch and made her sit down by her side
Then with her hand clasped in that of this excellent friend Mdlle de
Cardoville smiled on Djalma stretched adoringly at her feet and cast
on the dismayed princess a look of such calm and firm serenity so
nobly expressive of the invincible quiet of her happiness and her lofty
disdain of all calumnious attacks that the Princess de SaintDizier
confused and stupefied murmured some hardly intelligible words in a
voice trembling with passion and completely losing her presence of
mind rushed towards the door But at this moment the hunchback who
feared some ambush some perfidious plot in the background resolved
after exchanging a glance with Adrienne to accompany the princess to
her carriage

The angry disappointment of the Princess de SaintDizier when she saw
herself thus followed and watched appeared so comical to Mdlle de
Cardoville that she could not help laughing aloud and it was to the
sound of contemptuous hilarity that the hypocritical princess with rage
and despair in her heart quitted the house to which she had hoped to
bring trouble end misery Adrienne and Djalma were left alone Before
relating the scene which took place between them a few retrospective
words are indispensable It will easily be imagined that since Mdlle
de Cardoville and the Oriental had been brought into such close contact
after so many disappointments their days had passed away like a dream
of happiness Adrienne had especially taken pains to bring to light one
by one all the generous qualities of Djalma of which she had read so
much in her books of travels The young lady had imposed on herself this
tender and patient study of Djalmas character not only to justify
to her own mind the intensity of her love but because this period
of trial to which she had assigned a term enabled her to temper and
divert the violence of Djalmas passiona task the more meritorious
as she herself was of the same ardent temperament For in those two
lovers the finest qualities of sense and soul seemed exactly to balance
each other and heaven had bestowed on them the rarest beauty of form
and the most adorable excellence of heart as if to legitimatize the
irresistible attraction which drew and bound them together What then
was to be the term of this painful trial which Adrienne had imposed
on Djalma and on herself This is what Mdlle de Cardoville intended
to tell the prince in the interview she had with him after the abrupt
departure of the Princess de SaintDizier




CHAPTER LX THE ORDEAL

Adrienne de Cardoville and Djalma had remained alone Such was the
noble confidence which had succeeded in the Hindoos mind to his first
movement of unreflecting fury caused by the infamous calumny that
once alone with Adrienne he did not even allude to that shameful
accusation

On her side touching and admirable sympathy of those two hearts
the young lady was too proud conscious of the purity of her love to
descend to any justification of herself

She would have considered it an insult both to herself and him
Therefore the lovers began their interview as if the princess had
never made any such remark The same contempt was extended to the
papers which the princess had brought with her to prove the imminent
ruin to which Adrienne was exposed The young lady had laid them down
without reading them on a stand within her reach She made a graceful
sign to Djalma to seat himself by her side and accordingly he quitted
not without regret the place he had occupied at her feet

My love said Adrienne in a grave and tender voice you have often
impatiently asked me when would come the term of the trial we have laid
upon ourselves That moment is at hand

Djalma started and could not restrain a cry of surprise and joy but
this almost trembling exclamation was so soft and sweet that it seemed
rather the expression of ineffable gratitude than of exulting passion

Adrienne continued Separatedsurrounded by treachery and
fraudmutually deceived as to each others sentimentswe yet loved
on and in that followed an irresistible attraction stronger than every
opposing influence But since then in these days of happy retirement
from the world we have learned to value and esteem each other more
Left to ourselves in perfect freedom we have had the courage to resist
every temptation that hereafter we might be happy without remorse
During these days in which our hearts had been laid open to each other
we have read them thoroughly Yes Djalma I believe in you and you in
meI find in you all that you find in meevery possible human security
for our future happiness But this love must yet be consecrated and in
the eyes of the world in which we are called upon to live marriage is
the only consecration and marriage enchains ones whole life

Djalma looked at the young lady with surprise

Yes ones whole life and yet who can answer for the sentiments of a
whole life resumed Adrienne A God that could see into the future
could alone bind irrevocably certain hearts for their own happiness
but alas to human eyes the future is impenetrable Therefore to
accept indissoluble ties for any longer than one can answer for a
present sentiment is to commit an act of selfish and impious folly

Djalma made no reply but with an almost respectful gesture he urged
the speaker to continue

And then proceeded she with a mixture of tenderness and pride from
respect for your dignity and mine I would never promise to keep a law
made by man against woman with contemptuous and brutal egotisma
law which denies to woman soul mind and hearta law which none can
accept without being either a slave or perjureda law which takes
from the girl her name reduces the wife to a state of degrading
inferiority denies to the mother all rights over her own children
and enslaves one human creature to the will of another who is in all
respects her equal in the sight of GodYou know my love added the
young lady with passionate enthusiasm how much I honor you whose
father was called the Father of the Generous I do not then fear noble
and valiant heart to see you use against me these tyrannical powers
but throughout my life I never uttered a falsehood and our love is
too sacred and celestial to be purchased by a double perjury No never
will I swear to observe a law that my dignity and my reason refuse to
sanction If tomorrow the freedom of divorce were established and
the rights of women recognized I should be willing to observe usages
which would then be in accordance with my conscience and with what is
just possible and humane Then after a pause Adrienne continued
with such deep and sweet emotion that a tear of tenderness veiled her
beauteous eyes Oh if you knew my love what your love is to me if
you knew how dear and sacred I hold your happinessyou would excuse
you would understand these generous superstitions of a loving and
honest heart which could only see a fatal omen in forms degraded by
falsehood and perjury What I wish is to attach you by love to bind
you in chains of happinessand to leave you free that I may owe your
constancy only to your affection

Djalma had listened to the young girl with passionate attention Proud
and generous himself he admired this proud and generous character
After a moments meditative silence he answered in his sweet sonorous
voice in an almost solemn tone Like you I hold in detestation
falsehood and perjury Like you I think that man degrades himself by
accepting the right of being a cowardly tyrant even though resolved
never to use the power Like you I could not bear the thought that
I owed all I most valued not to your love alone but to the eternal
constraint of an indissoluble bond Like you I believe there is no
dignity but in freedom But you have said that for this great and holy
love you demand a religious consecration and if you reject vows that
you cannot make without folly and perjury are there then others which
your reason and your heart approveWho will pronounce the required
blessing To whom must these vows be spoken

In a few days my love I believe I shall be able to tell you all
Every evening after your departure I have no other thought I wish to
find the means of uniting yourself and mein the eyes of God not of
the lawwithout offending the habits and prejudices of a world in
which it may suit us hereafter to live Yes my friend when you know
whose are the noble hands that are to join ours together who is to
bless and glorify God in our uniona sacred union that will leave us
worthy and freeyou will say I am sure that never purer hands could
have been laid upon us Forgive me friend all this is in earnestyes
earnest as our love earnest as our happiness If my words seem to you
strange my thoughts unreasonable tell it me love We will seek and
find some better means to reconcile that we owe to heaven with what
we owe to the world and to ourselves It is said that lovers are beside
themselves added the young lady with a smile but I think that no
creatures are more reasonable

When I hear you speak thus of our happiness said Djalma deeply
moved with so much calm and earnest tenderness I think I see a mother
occupied with the future prospects of her darling childtrying
to surround him with all that can make him strong valiant and
generoustrying to remove far from him all that is ignoble and
unworthy You ask me to tell you if your thoughts seem strange to
me Adrienne You forget that what makes my faith in our love is
my feeling exactly as you do What offends you offends me also what
disgusts you disgusts me Just now when you cited to me the laws of
this country which respect in a woman not even a mothers rightI
thought with pride of our barbarous countries where woman though a
slave is made free when she becomes a mother No no such laws are not
made either for you or me Is it not to prove your sacred respect for
our love to wish to raise it above the shameful servitude that would
degrade it You see Adrienne I have often heard said by the priests of
my country that there were beings inferior to the gods but superior
to every other creature I did not believe those priests but now I do
These last words were uttered not in the tone of flattery but with
an accent of sincere conviction and with that sort of passionate
veneration and almost timid fervor which mark the believer talking of
his faith but what is impossible to describe is the ineffable harmony
of these almost religious words with the mild deep tone of the
young Orientals voiceas well as the ardent expression of amorous
melancholy which gave an irresistible charm to his enchanting features

Adrienne had listened to Djalma with an indescribable mixture of joy
gratitude and pride Laying her hand on her bosom as if to keep down
its violent pulsations she resumed as she looked at the prince with
delight Behold him ever the samejust good greatOh my heart
my heart how proudly it beats Blessed be God who created me for this
adored lover He must mean to astonish the world by the prodigies of
tenderness and charity that such a love may produce They do not yet
know the sovereign might of free happy ardent love Yes Djalma on
the day when our hands are joined together what hymns of gratitude
will ascend to heavenAh they do not know the immense the insatiable
longing for joy aria delight which possesses two hearts like ours they
do not know what rays of happiness stream from the celestial halo of
such a flameOh yes I feel it Many tears will be dried many cold
hearts warmed at the divine fire of our love And it will be by the
benedictions of those we serve that they will learn the intoxication of
our rapture

To the dazzled eyes of Djalma Adrienne appeared more and more an ideal
beingpartaking of the Divinity by her goodness of the animal nature
by passionfor yielding to the intensity of excitement Adrienne fixed
upon Djalma looks that sparkled with love

Then almost beside himself the Asiatic fell prostrate at the feet of
the maiden and exclaimed in a supplicating voice Mercy my courage
fails me Have pity on me do not talk thus Oh that day what years of
my life would I not give to hasten it

Silence no blasphemy Do not your years belong to me

Adrienne you love me

The young lady did not answer but her halfveiled burning glance
dealt the last blow to reason Seizing her hands in his own he
exclaimed with a tremulous voice That day in which we shall mount
to heaven in which we shall be gods in happinesswhy postpone it any
longer

Because our love must be consecrated by the benediction of heaven

Are we not free

Yes yes my love we are free Let us be worthy of our liberty

Adrienne mercy

I ask you also to have mercyto have mercy on the sacredness of our
love Do not profane it in its very flower Believe my heart believe my
presentiments to profane it would be to kill Courage my adored lover
a few days longerand then happinesswithout regret and without
remorse

And until then hell tortures without a name You do not cannot know
what I suffer when I leave your presence Your image follows me your
breath burns me up I cannot sleep but call on you every night with
sighs and tearsjust as I called on you when I thought you did not
love meand yet I know you love me I know you are mine But to see you
every day more beautiful more adoredand every day to quit you more
impassionedoh you cannot tell

Djalma was unable to proceed What he said of his devouring tortures
Adrienne had felt perhaps even more intensely Electrified by the
passionate words of Djalma so beautiful in his excitement her courage
failed and she perceived that an irresistible languor was creeping
over her By a last chaste effort of the will she rose abruptly and
hastening to the door which communicated with Mother Bunchs chamber
she exclaimed My sister help me

In another moment Mdlle de Cardoville her face bathed in tears
clasped the young sempstress in her arms while Djalma knelt
respectfully on the threshold he did not dare to pass




CHAPTER LXI AMBITION

A few days after the interview of Djalma and Adrienne just described
Rodin was alone in his bedchamber in the house in the Rue de
Vaugirard walking up and down the room where he had so valiantly
undergone the moxas of Dr Baleinier With his hands thrust into the
hindpockets of his greatcoat and his head bowed upon his breast the
Jesuit seemed to be reflecting profoundly and his varying walk now
slow now quick betrayed the agitation of his mind

On the side of Rome said Rodin to himself I am tranquil All is
going well The abdication is as good as settled and if I can pay them
the price agreed the Prince Cardinal can secure me a majority of nine
voices in the conclave Our General is with me the doubts of Cardinal
Malipieri are at an end or have found no echo Yet I am not quite easy
with regard to the reported correspondence between Father dAigrigny and
Malipieri I have not been able to intercept any of it No matter that
soldiers business is settled A little patience and he will be wiped
out

Here the pale lips were contracted by one of those frightful smiles
which gave to Rodins countenance so diabolical an expression

After a pause he resumed The funeral of the freethinker the
philanthropist the workmans friend took place yesterday at St
Herem Francis Hardy went off in a fit of ecstatic delirium I had
his donation it is true but this is more certain Everything may be
disputed in this world the dead dispute nothing

Rodin remained in thought for some moments then he added in a grave
tone There remain this redhaired wench and her mulatto This is the
twentyseventh of May the first of June approaches and these turtle
doves still seem invulnerable The princess thought she had hit upon
a good plan and I should have thought so too It was a good idea to
mention the discovery of Agricola Baudoin in the madcaps room for it
made the Indian tiger roar with savage jealousy Yes but then the
dove began to coo and hold out her pretty beak and the foolish tiger
sheathed his claws and rolled on the ground before her Its a pity
for there was some sense in the scheme

The walk of Rodin became more and more agitated Nothing is more
extraordinary continued he than the generative succession of ideas
In comparing this redhaired jade to a dove colombe I could not
help thinking of that infamous old woman SainteColombe whom that big
rascal Jacques Dumoulin pays his court to and whom the Abbe Corbinet
will finish I hope by turning to good account I have often remarked
that as a poet may find an excellent rhyme by mere chance so the
germ of the best ideas is sometimes found in a word or in some absurd
resemblance like the present That abominable hag SainteColombo and
the pretty Adrienne de Cardoville go as well together as a ring would
suit a cat or a necklace a fish Well there is nothing in it

Hardly had Rodin pronounced these words than he started suddenly
and his face shone with a fatal joy Then it assumed an expression of
meditative astonishment as happens when chance reveals some unexpected
discovery to the surprised and charmed inquirer after knowledge

Soon with raised head and sparkling eye his hollow cheeks swelling
with joy and pride Rodin folded his arms in triumph on his breast
and exclaimed Oh how admirable and marvellous are these mysterious
evolutions of the mind how incomprehensible is the chain of human
thought which starting from an absurd jingle of words arrives at
a splendid or luminous idea Is it weakness or is it strength
Strangevery strange I compare the redhaired girl to a dovea
colombe That makes me think of the hag who traded in the bodies and
souls of so many creatures Vulgar proverbs occur to me about a ring
and a cat a fish and a necklaceand suddenly at the word NECKLACE
a new light dawns upon me Yes that one word NECKLACE shall be to me a
golden key to open the portals of my brain so long foolishly closed

And after again walking hastily up and down Rodin continued Yes it
is worth attempting The more I reflect upon it the more feasible it
appears Only how to get at that wretch SaintColombe Well there
is Jacques Dumoulin and the otherwhere to find her That is the
stumblingblock I must not shout before I am out of the wood

Rodin began again to walk biting his nails with an air of deep thought
For some moments such was the tension of his mind large drops of sweat
stood on his yellow brow He walked up and down stopped stamped with
his foot now raised his eyes as if in search of an inspiration and now
scratched his head violently with his left hand whilst he continued
to gnaw the nails of the right Finally from time to time he uttered
exclamations of rage despondency or hope as by turns they took
possession of his mind If the cause of this monsters agitation had not
been horrible it would have been a curious and interesting spectacle to
watch the labors of that powerful brainto follow as it were on that
shifting countenance the progress and development of the project
on which he was now concentrating all the resources of his strong
intellect At length the work appeared to be near completion for Rodin
resumed Yes yes it is bold hazardousbut then it is prompt and
the consequences may be incalculable Who can foresee the effects of the
explosion of a mine

Then yielding to a movement of enthusiasm which was hardly natural
to him the Jesuit exclaimed with rapture Oh the passions the
passions what a magical instrument do they form if you do but touch
the keys with a light skillful and vigorous hand How beautiful too
is the power of thought Talk of the acorn that becomes an oak the seed
that grows up to the cornthe seed takes months the acorn centuries
to unfold its splendorsbut here is a little word in eight letters
necklace and this word falling into my brain but a few minutes ago has
grown and grown till it has become larger than any oak Yes that word
is the germ of an idea that like the oak lifts itself up towards
heaven for the greater glory of the Lordsuch as they call Him
and such as I would assert Him to be should I attainand I shall
attainfor these miserable Renneponts will pass away like a shadow And
what matters it after all to the moral order I am reserved to guide
whether these people live or die What do such lives weigh in the
balance of the great destinies of the world while this inheritance
which I shall boldly fling into the scale will lift me to a sphere
from which one commands many kings many nationslet them say and make
what noise they will The idiotsthe stupid idiots or rather the
kind blessed adorable idiots They think they have crushed us when
they say to us men of the church You take the spiritual but we will
keep the temporalOh their conscience or their modesty inspires them
well when it bids them not meddle with spiritual things They abandon
the spiritual they despise it they will have nothing to do with
itoh the venerable asses they do not see that even as they go
straight to the mill it is by the spiritual that we go straight to
the temporal As if the mind did not govern the body They leave us
the spiritualthat is command of the conscience soul heart and
judgmentthe spiritualthat is the distribution of heavens rewards
and punishments and pardonswithout check without control in the
secrecy of the confessionaland that dolt the temporal has nothing
but brute matter for his portion and yet rubs his paunch for joy Only
from time to time he perceives too late that if he has the body we
have the soul and that the soul governs the body and so the body ends
by coming with us alsoto the great surprise of Master Temporal who
stands staring with his hands on his paunch and says Dear me is it
possible

Then with a laugh of savage contempt Rodin began to walk with great
strides and thus continued Oh let me reach itlet me but reach the
place of SIXTUS Vand the world shall see one day when it awakes
what it is to have the spiritual power in hands like minein the hands
of a priest who for fifty years has lived hardly frugally chastely
and who were he pope would continue to live hardly frugally
chastely

Rodin became terrible as he spoke thus All the sanguinary
sacrilegious execrable ambition of the worst popes seemed written in
fiery characters on the brow of this son of Ignatius A morbid desire
of rule seemed to stir up the Jesuits impure blood he was bathed in
a burning sweat and a kind of nauseous vapor spread itself round about
him Suddenly the noise of a travellingcarriage which entered
the courtyard of the house attracted his attention Regretting his
momentary excitement he drew from his pocket his dirty white and red
cotton handkerchief and dipping it in a glass of water he applied
it to his cheeks and temples while he approached the window to look
through the halfopen blinds at the traveller who had just arrived
The projection of a portico over the door at which the carriage had
stopped intercepted Rodins view

No matter said he recovering his coolness I shall know presently
who is there I must write at once to Jacques Dumoulin to come hither
immediately He served me well with regard to that little slut in the
Rue Clovis who made my hair stand on end with her infernal Beranger
This time Dumoulin may serve me again I have him in my clutches and
he will obey me

Rodin sat down to his desk and wrote A few seconds later some one
knocked at the door which was doublelocked quite contrary to the
rules of the order But sure of his own influence and importance
Rodin who had obtained from the general permission to be rid for a
time of the inconvenient company of a socius often took upon himself to
break through a number of the rules A servant entered and delivered
a letter to Rodin Before opening it the latter said to the man What
carriage is that which just arrived

It comes from Rome father answered the servant bowing

From Rome said Rodin hastily and in spite of himself a vague
uneasiness was expressed in his countenance But still holding the
letter in his hands he added Who comes in the carriage

A reverend father of our blessed Company

Notwithstanding his ardent curiosity for he knew that a reverend
father travelling post is always charged with some important mission
Rodin asked no more questions on the subject but said as he pointed to
the paper in his hand Whence comes this letter

From our house at St Herem father

Rodin looked more attentively at the writing and recognized the hand of
Father dAigrigny who had been commissioned to attend M Hardy in his
last moments The letter ran as follows

I send a despatch to inform your reverence of a fact which is perhaps
more singular than important After the funeral of M Francis Hardy the
coffin which contained his remains had been provisionally deposited in
a vault beneath our chapel until it could be removed to the cemetery of
the neighboring town This morning when our people went down into
the vault to make the necessary preparations for the removal of the
bodythe coffin had disappeared

That is strange indeed said Rodin with a start Then he continued to
read

All search has hitherto been vain to discover the authors of the
sacrilegious deed The chapel being as you know at a distance from the
house they were able to effect an entry without disturbing us We
have found traces of a fourwheeled carriage on the damp ground in the
neighborhood but at some little distance from the chapel these marks
are lost in the sand and it has been impossible to follow them any
farther

Who can have carried away this body said Rodin with a thoughtful
air Who could have any interest in doing so

He continued to read

Luckily the certificate of death is quite correct I sent for a doctor
from Etampes to prove the disease and no question can be raised on
that point The donation is therefore good and valid in every respect
but I think it best to inform your reverence of what has happened that
you may take measures accordingly etc etc

After a moments reflection Rodin said to himself DAigrigny is right
in his remark it is more singular than important Still it makes one
think We must have an eye to this affair

Turning towards the servant who had brought him the letter Rodin gave
him the note he had just written to Ninny Moulin and said to him Let
this letter be taken instantly to its address and let the bearer wait
for an answer

Yes father

At the moment the servant left the room a reverend father entered
and said to Rodin Father Caboccini of Rome has just arrived with a
mission from our general to your reverence

At these words Rodins blood ran cold but he maintained his immovable
calmness and said simply Where is Father Caboccini

In the next room father

Beg him to walk in and leave us said the other

A second after Father Caboccini of Rome entered the room and was left
alone with Rodin




CHAPTER LXII TO A SOCIUS A SOCIUS AND A HALF

The Reverend Father Caboccini the Roman Jesuit who now came to visit
Rodin was a short man of about thirty years of age plump in good
condition and with an abdomen that swelled out his black cassock The
good little father was blind with one eye but his remaining organ of
vision sparkled with vivacity His rosy countenance was gay smiling
joyous splendidly crowned with thick chestnut hair which curled like
a wax dolls His address was cordial to familiarity and his expansive
and petulant manners harmonized well with his general appearance In a
second Rodin had taken his measure of the Italian emissary and as he
knew the practice of his Company and the ways of Rome he felt by
no means comfortable at sight of this jolly little father with such
affable manners He would have less feared some tall bony priest with
austere and sepulchral countenance for he knew that the Company loves
to deceive by the outward appearance of its agents and if Rodin guessed
rightly the cordial address of this personage would rather tend to show
that he was charged with some fatal mission

Suspicious attentive with eye and mind on the watch like an old wolf
expecting an attack Rodin advanced as usual slowly and tortuously
towards the little man so as to have time to examine him thoroughly
and penetrate beneath his jovial outside But the Roman left him no
space for that purpose In his impetuous affection he threw himself
right on the neck of Rodin pressed him in his arms with an effusion
of tenderness and kissed him over and over again upon both cheeks so
loudly and plentifully that the echo resounded through the apartment
In his life Rodin had never been so treated More and more uneasy at the
treachery which must needs lurk under such warm embraces and irritated
by his own evil presentiments the French Jesuit did all he could to
extricate himself from the Romans exaggerated tokens of tenderness
But the latter kept his hold his arms though short were vigorous and
Rodin was kissed over and over again till the little oneeyed man was
quite out of breath It is hardly necessary to state that these embraces
were accompanied by the most friendly affectionate and fraternal
exclamationsall in tolerably good French but with a strong Italian
accent which we muss beg the reader to supply for himself after we
have given a single specimen It will perhaps be remembered that
fully aware of the danger he might possibly incur by his ambitious
machinations and knowing from history that the use of poison had often
been considered at Rome as a state necessity Rodin on being suddenly
attacked with the cholera had exclaimed with a furious glance at
Cardinal Malipieri I am poisoned

The same apprehensions occurred involuntarily to the Jesuits mind as
he tried by useless efforts to escape from the embraces of the Italian
emissary and he could not help muttering to himself This oneeyed
fellow is a great deal too fond I hope there is no poison under his
Judaskisses At last little Father Caboccini being quite out
of breath was obliged to relinquish his hold on Rodins neck who
readjusting his dirty collar and his old cravat and waistcoat somewhat
in disorder in consequence of this hurricane of caresses said in a
gruff tone Your humble servant father but you need not kiss quite so
hard

Without making any answer to this reproach the little father riveted
his one eye upon Rodin with an expression of enthusiasm and exclaimed
whilst he accompanied his words with petulant gestures At lazt I
zee te zuperb light of our zacred Company and can zalute him from my
heartvonse more vonse more

As the little father had already recovered his breath and was about to
rush once again into Rodins arms the latter stepped back hastily and
held out his arm to keep him off saying in allusion to the illogical
metaphor employed by Father Caboccini First of all father one
does not embrace a lightand then I am not a lightI am a humble and
obscure laborer in the Lords vineyard

The Roman replied with enthusiasm we shall henceforth translate his
gibberish You are right father we cannot embrace a light but we
can prostrate ourselves before it and admire its dazzling brightness

So saying Caboccini was about to suit the action to the word and to
prostrate himself before Rodin had not the latter prevented this mode
of adulation by seizing the Roman by the arm and exclaiming This is
mere idolatry father Pass over my qualities and tell me what is the
object of your journey

The object my dear father fills me with joy and happiness I have
endeavored to show you my affection by my caresses for my heart is
overflowing I have hardly been able to restrain myself during my
journey hither for my heart rushed to meet you The object transports
delights enchants me

But what enchants you cried Rodin exasperated by these Italian
exaggerations What is the object

This rescript of our very reverend and excellent General will inform
you my clear father

Caboccini drew from his pocketbook a folded paper with three seals
which he kissed respectfully and delivered to Rodin who himself kissed
it in his turn and opened it with visible anxiety While he read it the
countenance of the Jesuit remained impassible but the pulsation of the
arteries on his temples announced his internal agitation Yet he put the
letter coolly into his pocket and looking at the Roman said to him
Be it as our excellent General has commanded

Then father cried Caboccini with a new effusion of tenderness and
admiration I shall be the shadow of your light and in fact your
second self I shall have the happiness of being always with you day
and night and of acting as your socius since after having allowed
you to be without one for some time according to your wish and for the
interest of our blessed Company our excellent General now thinks fit to
send me from Rome to fill that post about your personan unexpected
an immense favor which fills me with gratitude to our General and with
love to you my dear my excellent father

It is well played thought Rodin but I am not so soft and tis only
among the blind that your Cyclops are kings

The evening of the day in which this scene took place between the
Jesuit and his new socius Ninny Moulin after receiving in presence
of Caboccini the instructions of Rodin went straight to Madame de la
SainteColombes

This woman had made her fortune at the time of the allies taking Paris
by keeping one of those pretty milliners shops whose pink bonnets
have run into a proverb not extinct in these days when bonnets are not
known Ninny Moulin had no better well to draw inspiration from when
as now he had to find out as per Rodins order a girl of an age and
appearance which singularly enough were closely resembling those of
Mdlle de Cardoville

No doubt of Ninny Moulins success in this mission for the next morning
Rodin whose countenance wore a triumphant expression put with his own
hand a letter into the post

This letter was addressed

To M Agricola Baudoin No 2 Rue BriseMiche Paris




CHAPTER LXIII FARINGHEAS AFFECTION

It will perhaps be remembered that Djalma when he heard for the first
time that he was beloved by Adrienne had in the fulness of his joy
spoken thus to Faringhea whose treachery he had just discovered You
leagued with my enemies and I had done you no harm You are wicked
because you are no doubt unhappy I will strive to make you happy so
that you may be good Would you have goldyou shall have it Would
you have a friendthough you are a slave a kings son offers you his
friendship

Faringhea had refused the gold and appeared to accept the friendship
of the son of Kadjasing Endowed with remarkable intelligence and
extraordinary power of dissimulation the halfbreed had easily persuaded
the prince of the sincerity of his repentance and obtained credit for
his gratitude and attachment from so confiding and generous a character
Besides what motives could Djalma have to suspect the slave now become
his friend Certain of the love of Mdlle de Cardoville with whom he
passed a portion of every day her salutary influence would have guarded
him against any dangerous counsels or calumnies of the halfcaste a
faithful and secret instrument of Rodin and attached by him to the
Company But Faringhea whose tact was amazing did not act so lightly
he never spoke to the prince of Mdlle de Cardoville and waited
unobtrusively for the confidential communications into which Djalma was
sometimes hurried by his excessive joy A few days after the interview
last described between Adrienne and Djalma and on the morrow of the day
when Rodin certain of the success of Ninny Moulins mission to Sainte
Colombe had himself put a letter in the post to the address of Agricola
Baudoin the halfcaste who for some time had appeared oppressed with a
violent grief seemed to get so much worse that the prince struck with
the desponding air of the man asked him kindly and repeatedly the cause
of his sorrow But Faringhea while he gratefully thanked the prince for
the interest he took in him maintained the most absolute silence and
reserve on the subject of his grief

These preliminaries will enable the reader to understand the following
scene which took place about noon in the house in the Rue de Clichy
occupied by the Hindoo Contrary to his habit Djalma had not passed
that morning with Adrienne He had been informed the evening before
by the young lady that she must ask of him the sacrifice of this whole
day to take the necessary measures to make their marriage sacred and
acceptable in the eyes of the world and yet free from the restrictions
which she and Djalma disapproved As for the means to be employed by
Mdlle de Cardoville to attain this end and the name of the pure and
honorable person who was to consecrate their union these were secrets
which not belonging exclusively to the young lady could not yet be
communicated to Djalma To the Indian so long accustomed to devote
every instant to Adrienne this day seemed interminable By turns a
prey to the most burning agitation and to a kind of stupor in which
he plunged himself to escape from the thoughts that caused his tortures
Djalma lay stretched upon a divan with his face buried in his hands
as if to shut out the view of a too enchanting vision Suddenly
without knocking at the door as usual Faringhea entered the princes
apartment

At the noise the halfcaste made in entering Djalma started raised
his head and looked round him with surprise but on seeing the pale
agitated countenance of the slave he rose hastily and advancing
towards him exclaimed What is the matter Faringhea

After a moments silence and as if struggling with a painful feeling of
hesitation Faringhea threw himself at the feet of Djalma and murmured
in a weak despairing almost supplicating voice I am very miserable
Pity me my good lord

The tone was so touching the grief under which the halfbreed suffered
seemed to give to his features generally fixed and hard as bronze
such a heartrending expression that Djalma was deeply affected and
bending to raise him from the ground said to him in a kindly voice
Speak to me Confidence appeases the torments of the heart Trust me
friendfor my angel herself said to me that happy love cannot bear to
see tears about him

But unhappy love miserable love betrayed loveweeps tears of blood
replied Faringhea with painful dejection

Of what love dost thou speak asked Djalma in surprise

I speak of my love answered the halfcaste with a gloomy air

Of your love said Djalma more and more astonished not that the half
caste still young and with a countenance of sombre beauty appeared
to him incapable of inspiring or feeling the tender passion but that
until now he had never imagined him capable of conceiving so deep a
sorrow

My lord resumed the halfcaste you told me that misfortune had
made me wicked and that happiness would make me good In those words
I saw a presentiment and a noble love entered my heart at the moment
when hatred and treachery departed from it I the halfsavage found a
woman beautiful and young to respond to my passion At least I thought
so But I had betrayed you my lord and there is no happiness for
a traitor even though he repent In my turn I have been shamefully
betrayed

Then seeing the surprise of the prince the halfcaste added as if
overwhelmed with confusion Do not mock me my lord The most frightful
tortures would not have wrung this confession from me but you the son
of a king deigned to call the poor slave your friend

And your friend thanks you for the confidence answered Djalma Far
from mocking he will console you Mock you do you think it possible

Betrayed love merits contempt and insult said Faringhea bitterly
Even cowards may point at one with scornfor in this country the
sight of the man deceived in what is dearest to his soul the very life
blood of his life only makes people shrug their shoulders and laugh

But are you certain of this treachery said Djalma mildly Then he
added with visible hesitation that proved the goodness of his heart
Listen to me and forgive me for speaking of the past It will only be
another proof that I cherish no evil memories and that I fully believe
in your repentance and affection Remember that I also once thought
that she who is the angel of my life did not love meand yet it
was false Who tells you that you are not like me deceived by false
appearances

Alas my lord could I only believe so But I dare not hope it My
brain wanders uncertain I cannot come to any resolution and therefore
I have recourse to you

But what causes your suspicions

Her coldness which sometimes succeeds to apparent tenderness The
refusals she gives me in the name of duty Yes added the halfcaste
after a moments silence she reasons about her lovea proof that she
has never loved me or that she loves me no more

On the contrary she perhaps loves you all the more that she takes
into consideration the interest and the dignity of her love

That is what they all say replied the halfcaste with bitter irony
as he fixed a penetrating look on Djalma thus speak all those who love
weakly coldly but those who love valiantly never show these insulting
suspicions For them a word from the man they adore is a command
they do not haggle and bargain for the cruel pleasure of exciting the
passion of their lover to madness and so ruling him more surely No
what their lover asks of them were it to cost life and honor they
would grant it without hesitationbecause with them the will of the
man they love is above every other consideration divine and human But
those crafty women whose pride it is to tame and conquer manwho take
delight in irritating his passion and sometimes appear on the point of
yielding to itare demons who rejoice in the tears and torments of the
wretch that loves them with the miserable weakness of a child While we
expire with love at their feet the perfidious creatures are calculating
the effects of their refusals and seeing how far they can go without
quite driving their victim to despair Oh how cold and cowardly are
they compared to the valiant truehearted women who say to the men
of their choice Let me be thine todayand tomorrow come shame
despair and deathit matters little Be happy my life is not worth
one tear of thine

Djalmas brow had darkened as he listened Having kept inviolable the
secret of the various incidents of his passion for Mdlle de Cardoville
he could not but see in these words a quite involuntary allusion to the
delays and refusals of Adrienne And yet Djalma suffered a moment in his
pride at the thought of considerations and duties that a woman holds
dearer than her love But this bitter and painful thought was soon
effaced from the orientals mind thanks to the beneficent influence of
the remembrance of Adrienne His brow again cleared and he answered
the halfcaste who was watching him attentively with a sidelong glance
You are deluded by grief If you have no other reason to doubt her you
love than these refusals and vague suspicions be satisfied You are
perhaps loved better than you can imagine

Alas would it were so my lord replied the halfcaste dejectedly
as if he had been deeply touched by the words of Djalma Yet I say
to myself There is for this woman something stronger than her
lovedelicacy dignity honor what you willbut she does not love me
enough to sacrifice for me this something

Friend you are deceived answered Djalma mildly though the words
affected him with a painful impression The greater the love of a
woman the more it should be chaste and noble It is love itself that
awakens this delicacy and these scruples He rules instead of being
ruled

That is true replied the halfcaste with bitter irony Love so
rules me that this woman bids me love in her own fashion and I have
only to submit

Pausing suddenly Faringhea hid his face in his hands and heaved a deep
drawn sigh His features expressed a mixture of hate rage and despair
at once so terrible and so painful that Djalma more and more affected
exclaimed as he seized the others hand Calm this fury and listen to
the voice of friendship It will disperse this evil influence Speak to
me

No no it is too dreadful

Speak I bid thee

No leave the wretch to his despair

Do you think me capable of that said Djalma with a mixture of
mildness and dignity which seemed to make an impression on the half
caste

Alas replied he hesitating do you wish to hear more my lord

I wish to hear all

Well then I have not told you allfor at the moment of making this
confession shame and the fear of ridicule kept me back You asked me
what reason I had to believe myself betrayed I spoke to you of vague
suspicions refusals coldness That is not allthis evening

Go on

This eveningshe made an appointmentwith a man that she prefers to
me

Who told you so

A stranger who pitied my blindness

And suppose the man deceived youor deceives himself

He has offered me proofs of what he advances

What proofs

He will enable me this evening to witness the interview It may be
said he that this appointment may have no guilt in it notwithstanding
appearances to the contrary Judge for yourself have courage and your
cruel indecision will be at an end

And what did you answer

Nothing my lord My head wandered as it does now and I came to you for
advice

Then making a gesture of despair he proceeded with a savage laugh
Advice It is from the blade of my kandjiar that I should ask counsel
It would answer Blood blood

Faringhea grasped convulsively the long dagger attached to his girdle
There is a sort of contagion in certain forms of passion At sight of
Faringheas countenance agitated by jealous fury Djalma shudderedfor
he remembered the fit of insane rage with which he had been possessed
when the Princess de SaintDizier had defied Adrienne to contradict her
as to the discovery of Agricola Baudoin in her bedchamber But then
reassured by the ladys proud and noble bearing Djalma had soon learned
to despise the horrible calumny which Adrienne had not even thought
worthy of an answer Still two or three times as the lightning will
flash suddenly across the clearest sky the remembrance of that shameful
accusation had crossed the princes mind like a streak of fire but
had almost instantly vanished in the serenity and happiness of his
ineffable confidence in Adriennes heart These memories however
whilst they saddened the mind of Djalma only made him more
compassionate with regard to Faringhea than he might have been without
this strange coincidence between the position of the halfcaste and his
own Knowing by his own experience to what madness a blind fury may
be carried and wishing to tame the halfcaste by affectionate
kindness Djalma said to him in a grave and mild tone I offered you my
friendship I will now act towards you a friend

But Faringhea seemingly a prey to a dull and mute frenzy stood with
fixed and haggard eyes as though he did not hear Djalma

The latter laid his hand on his shoulder and resumed Faringhea
listen to me

My lord said the halfcaste starting abruptly as from a dream
forgive mebut

In the anguish occasioned by these cruel suspicions it is not of your
kandjiar that you must take counselbut of your friend

My lord

To this interview which will prove the innocence or the treachery of
your beloved you will do well to go

Oh yes said the halfcaste in a hollow voice and with a bitter
smile I shall be there

But you must not go alone

What do you mean my lord cried the halfcaste Who will accompany
me

I will

You my lord

Yesperhaps to save you from a crimefor I know how blind and unjust
is the earliest outburst of rage

But that transport gives us revenge cried the halfcaste with a
cruel smile

Faringhea this day is all my own I shall not leave you said the
prince resolutely Either you shall not go to this interview or I
will accompany you

The halfcaste appeared conquered by this generous perseverance He fell
at the feet of Djalma pressed the princes hand respectfully to his
forehead and to his lips and said My lord be generous to the end
forgive me

For what should I forgive you

Before I spoke to you I had the audacity to think of asking for what
you have just freely offered Not knowing to what extent my fury might
carry me I had thought of asking you this favor which you would not
perhaps grant to an equal but I did not dare to do it I shrunk even
from the avowal of the treachery I have cause to fear and I came only
to tell you of my miserybecause to you alone in all the world I could
tell it

It is impossible to describe the almost candid simplicity with which
the halfbreed pronounced these words and the soft tones mingled with
tears which had succeeded his savage fury Deeply affected Djalma
raised him from the ground and said You were entitled to ask of me a
mark of friendship I am happy in having forestalled you Courage be of
good cheer I will accompany you to this interview and if my hopes
do not deceive me you will find you have been deluded by false
appearances

When the night was come the halfbreed and Djalma wrapped in their
cloaks got into a hackneycoach Faringhea ordered the coachman to
drive to the house inhabited by SainteColombe




CHAPTER LXIV AN EVENING AT SAINTECOLOMBES

Leaving Djalma and Faringhea in the coach on their way a few words are
indispensable before continuing this scene Ninny Moulin ignorant of
the real object of the step he took at the instigation of Rodin had
on the evening before according to orders received from the latter
offered a considerable sum to SainteColombe to obtain from that
creature still singularly rapacious the use of her apartments for
whole day SainteColombe having accepted this proposition too
advantageous to be refused had set out that morning with her servants
to whom she wished she said in return for their good services to give
a days pleasure in the country Master of the house Rodin in a black
wig blue spectacles and a cloak and with his mouth and chin buried
in a worsted comforterin a word perfectly disguisedhad gone that
morning to take a look at the apartments and to give his instructions
to the halfcaste The latter in two hours from the departure of the
Jesuit had thanks to his address and intelligence completed the most
important preparation and returned in haste to Djalma to play with
detestable hypocrisy the scene at which we have just been present

During the ride from the Rue de Clichy to the Rue de Richelieu
Faringhea appeared plunged in a mournful reverie Suddenly he said
to Djalma to a quick tone My lord if I am betrayed I must have
vengeance

Contempt is a terrible revenge answered Djalma

No no replied the halfcaste with an accent of repressed rage It
is not enough The nearer the moment approaches the more I feel I must
have blood

Listen to me

My lord have pity on me I was a coward to draw back from my revenge
Let me leave you my lord I will go alone to this interview

So saying Faringhea made a movement as if he would spring from the
carriage

Djalma held him by the arm and said Remain I wilt not leave you
If you are betrayed you shall not shed blood Contempt will avenge and
friendship will console you

No no my lord I am resolved When I have killedthen I will kill
myself cried the halfcaste with savage excitement This kandjiar
for the false ones added he laying his hand on his dagger The
poison in the hilt for me

Faringhea

If I resist you my lord forgive me My destiny must be accomplished

Time pressed and Djalma despairing to calm the others ferocious rage
resolved to have recourse to a stratagem

After some minutes silence he said to Faringhea I will not leave
you I will do all I can to save you from a crime If I do not succeed
the blood you shed be on your own head This hand shall never again be
locked in yours

These words appeared to make a deep impression on Faringhea He breathed
a long sigh and bowing his head upon his breast remained silent
and full of thought Djalma prepared by the faint light of the lamps
reflected in the interior of the coach to throw himself suddenly on
the halfcaste and disarm him But the latter who saw at a glance the
intention of the prince drew his kandjiar abruptly from his girdle
and holding it still in its sheath said to the prince in a halfsolemn
halfsavage tone This dagger in a strong hand is terrible and in
this phial is one of the most subtle poisons of our country

He touched a spring and the knob at the top of the hilt rose like a
lid discovering the mouth of a small crystal phial concealed in this
murderous weapon

Two or three drops of this poison upon the lips resumed the half
caste and death comes slowly and peacefully in a few hours and
without pain Only for the first symptom the nails turn blue But he
who emptied this phial at a draught would fall dead as if struck by
lightning

Yes replied Djalma I know that our country produces such mysterious
poisons But why lay such stress on the murderous properties of this
weapon

To show you my lord that this kandjiar would ensure the success and
impunity of my vengeance With the blade I could destroy and by the
poison escape from human justice Well my lord this kandjiartake
itI give it up to youI renounce my vengeancerather than render
myself unworthy to clasp again your hand

He presented the dagger to the prince who as pleased as surprised
at this unexpected determination hastily secured the terrible weapon
beneath his own girdle whilst the halfbreed continued in a voice of
emotion Deep this kandjiar my lordand when you have seen and heard
all that we go to hear and seeyou shall either give me the dagger
to strike a wretchor the poison to die without striking You shall
command I will obey

Djalma was about to reply when the coach stopped at the house inhabited
by SainteColombe The prince and the halfcaste well enveloped in
their mantles entered a dark porch and the door was closed after them
Faringhea exchanged a few words with the porter and the latter gave him
a key The two Orientals soon arrived at SainteColombes apartments
which had two doors opening upon the landingplace besides a private
entrance from the courtyard As he put the key into the lock Faringhea
said to Djalma in an agitated voice Pity my weakness my lordbut
at this terrible moment I tremble and hesitate It were perhaps better
to doubtor to forget

Then as the prince was about to answer the halfcaste exclaimed No
we must have no cowardice and opening the door precipitately he
entered followed by Djalma

When the door was again closed the prince and the halfcaste found
themselves in a dark and narrow passage Your hand my lordlet me
guide youwalk lightly said Faringhea in a low whisper

He extended his hand to the prince who took hold of it and they
both advanced silently through the darkness After leading Djalma some
distance and opening and closing several doors the halfcaste stopped
abruptly and abandoning the hand which he had hitherto held said to
the prince My lord the decisive moment approaches let us wait here
for a few seconds

A profound silence followed these words of the halfcaste The darkness
was so complete that Djalma could distinguish nothing In about a
minute he heard Faringhea moving away from him and then a door was
suddenly opened and as abruptly closed and locked This circumstance
made Djalma somewhat uneasy By a mechanical movement he laid his hand
upon his dagger and advanced cautiously towards the side where he
supposed the door to be

Suddenly the halfcastes voice struck upon his ear though it was
impossible to guess whence it came My lord it said you told me
you were my friend I act as a friend If I have employed stratagem
to bring you hither it is because the blindness of your fatal passion
would otherwise have prevented your accompanying me The Princess de
Saint Dizier named to you Agricola Baudoin the lover of Adrienne de
Cardoville Listenlookjudge

The voice ceased It appeared to have issued from one corner of the
room Djalma still in darkness perceived too late into what a snare he
had fallen and trembled with ragealmost with alarm

Faringhea he exclaimed where am I where are you Open the door on
your life I would leave this place instantly

Extending his arms the prince advanced hastily several steps but he
only touched a tapestried wall he followed it hoping to find the
door and he at length found it but it was locked and resisted all his
efforts He continued his researches and came to a fireplace with no
fire in it and to a second door equally fast In a few moments he
had thus made the circle of the room and found himself again at the
fireplace The anxiety of the prince increased more and more He called
Faringhea in a voice trembling with passion There was no answer
Profound silence reigned without and complete darkness within Ere
long a perfumed vapor of indescribable sweetness but very subtle and
penetrating spread itself insensibly through the little room in which
Djalma was It might be that the orifice of a tube passing through one
of the doors of the room introduced this balmy current At the height
of angry and terrible thoughts Djalma paid no attention to this
odorbut soon the arteries of his temples began to beat violently a
burning heat seemed to circulate rapidly through his veins he felt a
sensation of pleasure his resentment died gradually away and a mild
ineffable torpor crept over him without his being fully conscious of
the mental transformation that was taking place Yet by a last effort
of the wavering will Djalma advanced once more to try and open one
of the doors he found it indeed but at this place the vapor was so
strong that its action redoubled and unable to move a step further
Djalma was obliged to support himself by leaning against the wall43

Then a strange thing happened A faint light spread itself gradually
through an adjoining apartment and Djalma now perceived for the first
time the existence of a little round window in the wall of the room in
which he was On the side of the prince this opening was protected by
a slight but strong railing which hardly intercepted the view On the
other side a thick piece of plateglass was fixed at the distance of two
or three inches from the railing in question The room which Djalma saw
through this window and through which the faint light was now gradually
spreading was richly furnished Between two windows hung with crimson
silk curtains stood a kind of wardrobe with a lookingglass front
opposite the fireplace in which glowed the burning coals was a long
wide divan furnished with cushions

In another second a woman entered this apartment Her face and figure
were invisible being wrapped in a long hooded mantle of peculiar
form and a dark color The sight of this mantle made Djalma start To
the pleasure he at first felt succeeded a feverish anxiety like the
growing fumes of intoxication There was that strange buzzing in his
ears which we experience when we plunge into deep waters It was in a
kind of delirium that Djalma looked on at what was passing in the next
room The woman who had just appeared entered with caution almost with
fear Drawing aside one of the window curtains she glanced through
the closed blinds into the street Then she returned slowly to the
fireplace where she stood for a moment pensive still carefully
enveloped in her mantle Completely yielding to the influence of the
vapor which deprived him of his presence of mindforgetting Faringhea
and all the circumstances that had accompanied his arrival at this
houseDjalma concentrated all the powers of his attention on the
spectacle before him at which he seemed to be present as in a dream

Suddenly Djalma saw the woman leave the fireplace and advance towards
the lookingglass Turning her face toward it she allowed the mantle
to glide down to her feet Djalma was thunderstruck He saw the face
of Adrienne de Cardoville Yes Adrienne as he had seen her the night
before attired as during her interview with the Princess de Saint
Dizierthe light green dress the rosecolored ribbons the white
head ornaments A network of white beads concealed her back hair and
harmonized admirably with the shining gold of her ringlets Finally as
far as the Hindoo could judge through the railing and the thick glass
and in the faint light it was the figure of Adrienne with her marble
shoulders and swanlike neck so proud and so graceful In a word he
could not he did not doubt that it was Adrienne de Cardoville Djalma
was bathed in a burning dew his dizzy excitement increased and with
bloodshot eye and heaving bosom he remained motionless gazing almost
without the power of thought The young lady with her back still
turned towards Djalma arranged her hair with graceful art took off the
network which formed her headdress placed it on the chimneypiece and
began to unfasten her gown then withdrawing from the lookingglass
she disappeared for an instant from Djalmas view

She is expecting Agricola Baudoin her lover said a voice which
seemed to proceed from the wall of the dark room in which Djalma was

Notwithstanding his bewilderment these terrible words She is
expecting Agricola Baudoin her lover passed like a stream of fire
through the brain and heart of the prince A cloud of blood came over
his eyes he uttered a hollow moan which the thickness of the glass
prevented from being heard in the next room and broke his nails in
attempting to tear down the iron railing before the window

Having reached this paroxysm of delirious rage Djalma saw the uncertain
light grow still fainter as if it had been discreetly obscured and
through the vapory shadow that hung before him he perceived the young
lady returning clad in a long white dressinggown and with her
golden curls floating over her naked arms and shoulders She advanced
cautiously in the direction of a door which was hid from Djalmas view
At this moment one of the doors of the apartment in which the prince
was concealed was gently opened by an invisible hand Djalma noticed it
by the click of the lock and by the current of fresh air which streamed
upon his face for he could see nothing This door left open for
Djalma like that in the next room to which the young lady had drawn
near led to a sort of antechamber communicating with the stairs which
some one now rapidly ascended and stopping short knocked twice at the
outer door

Here comes Agricola Baudoin Look and listen said the same voice that
the prince had already heard

Mad intoxicated but with the fixed idea and reckless determination of
a madman or a drunkard Djalma drew the dagger which Faringhea had left
in his possession and stood in motionless expectation Hardly were the
two knocks heard before the young lady quitted the apartment from which
streamed a faint ray of light ran to the door of the staircase so that
some faint glimmer reached the place where Djalma stood watching his
dagger in his hand He saw the young lady pass across the antechamber
and approach the door of the staircase where she said in a whisper
Who is there

It is IAgricola Baudoin answered from without a manly voice

What followed was rapid as lightning and must be conceived rather than
described Hardly had the young lady drawn the bolt of the door hardly
had Agricola Baudoin stepped across the threshold than Djalma with the
bound of a tiger stabbed as it were at once so rapid were the strokes
both the young lady who fell dead on the floor and Agricola who sank
dangerously wounded by the side of the unfortunate victim This
scene of murder rapid as thought took place in the midst of a half
obscurity Suddenly the faint light from the chamber was completely
extinguished and a second after Djalma felt his arm seized in the
darkness by an iron grasp and the voice of Faringhea whispered You
are avenged Come we can secure our retreat Inert stupefied at what
he had done Djalma offered no resistance and let himself be dragged
by the halfcaste into the inner apartment from which there was another
way out

When Rodin had exclaimed in his admiration of the generative power
of thought that the word NECKLACE had been the germ of the infernal
project he then contemplated it was that chance had brought to his
mind the remembrance of the too famous affair of the diamond necklace
in which a woman thanks to her vague resemblance to Queen Marie
Antoinette being dressed like that princess and favored by the
uncertainty of a twilight had played so skillfully the part of her
unfortunate sovereign as to make the Cardinal Prince de Rohan though
familiar with the court the complete dupe of the illusion Having once
determined on his execrable design Rodin had sent Jacques Dumoulin to
SainteColombe without telling him the real object of his mission to
ask this experienced woman to procure a fine young girl tall and
with red hair Once found a costume exactly resembling that worn by
Adrienne and of which the Princess de SaintDizier gave the description
to Rodin though herself ignorant of this new plot was to complete the
deception The rest is known or may be guessed The unfortunate girl
who acted as Adriennes double believed she was only aiding in a jest
As for Agricola he had received a letter in which he was invited to
a meeting that might be of the greatest importance to Mdlle de
Cardoville

43 See the strange effect of hasheesh To the effect of this is
attributed the kind of hallucination which seized on those unhappy
persons whom the Prince of the Assassins the Old Man of the Mountain
used as the instruments of his vengeance




CHAPTER LXV THE NUPTIAL BED

The mild light of a circular lamp of oriental alabaster suspended from
the ceiling by three silver chains spreads a faint lustre through the
bedchamber of Adrienne de Cardoville

The large ivory bedstead inlaid with motherofpearl is not at present
occupied and almost disappears beneath snowy curtains of lace
and muslin transparent and vapory as clouds On the white marble
mantlepiece from beneath which the fire throws ruddy beams on the
ermine carpet is the usual basket filled with a bush of red camellias
in the midst of their shining green leaves A pleasant aromatic odor
rising from a warm and perfumed bath in the next room penetrates every
corner of the bedchamber All without is calm and silent It is hardly
eleven oclock The ivory door opposite to that which leads to the
bathroom opens slowly Djalma appears Two hours have elapsed since he
committed a double murder and believed that he had killed Adrienne in a
fit of jealous fury

The servants of Mdlle de Cardoville accustomed to Djalmas daily
visits no longer announced his arrival and admitted him without
difficulty having received no orders to the contrary from their
mistress He had never before entered the bedchamber but knowing that
the apartment the lady occupied was on the first floor of the house
he had easily found it As he entered that virgin sanctuary his
countenance was pretty calm so well did he control his feelings only a
slight paleness tarnished the brilliant amber of his complexion He wore
that day a robe of purple cashmere striped with silvera color which
did not show the stains of blood upon it Djalma closed the door after
him and tore off his white turban for it seemed to him as if a band of
hot iron encircled his brow His dark hair streamed around his handsome
face He crossed his arms upon his bosom and looked slowly about him
When his eyes rested on Adriennes bed he started suddenly and his
cheek grew purple Then he drew his hand across his brow hung down his
head and remained standing for some moments in a dream motionless as a
statue

After a mournful silence of a few seconds duration Djalma fell upon
his knees and raised his eyes to heaven The Asiatics countenance was
bathed in tears and no longer expressed any violent passion On his
features was no longer the stamp of hate or despair or the ferocious
joy of vengeance gratified It was rather the expression of grief at
once simple and immense For several minutes he was almost choked with
sobs and tears ran freely down his cheeks

Dead dead he murmured in a halfstifled voice She who this
morning slept so peacefully in this chamber And I have killed her Now
that she is dead what is her treachery to me I should not have killed
her for that She had betrayed me she loved the man whom I slewshe
loved him Alas I could not hope to gain the preference added he
with a touching mixture of resignation and remorse I poor untaught
youthhow could I merit her love It was my fault that she did not love
me but always generous she concealed from me her indifference that
she might not make me too unhappyand for that I killed her What
was her crime Did she not meet me freely Did she not open to me her
dwelling Did she not allow me to pass whole days with her No doubt she
tried to love me and could not I loved her with all the faculties of
my soul but my love was not such as she required For that I should
not have killed her But a fatal delusion seized me and after it was
done I woke as from a dream Alas it was not a dream I have killed
her And yetuntil this eveningwhat happiness I owed to herwhat
hopewhat joy She made my heart better nobler more generous All
came from her added the Indian with a new burst of grief That
remained with meno one could take from me that treasure of the
pastthat ought to have consoled me But why think of it I struck them
bothher and the manwithout a struggle It was a cowardly murderthe
ferocity of the tiger that tears its innocent prey

Djalma buried his face in his hands Then drying his tears he resumed
I know clearly that I mean to die also But my death will not restore
her to life

He rose from the ground and drew from his girdle Faringheas bloody
dagger then taking the little phial from the hilt he threw the blood
stained blade upon the ermine carpet the immaculate whiteness of which
was thus slightly stained with red

Yes resumed Djalma holding the phial with a convulsive grasp I
know well that I am about to die It is right Blood for blood my life
for hers How happens it that my steel did not turn aside How could I
kill herbut it is doneand my heart is full of remorse and sorrow
an inexpressible tendernessand I have come hereto die

Here in this chamber he continued the heaven of my burning
visions And then he added with a heartrending accent as he again
buried his face in his hands Dead dead

Well I too shall soon be dead he resumed in a firmer voice
But no I will die slowly gradually A few drops of the poison will
suffice and when I am quite certain of dying my remorse will perhaps
be less terrible Yesterday she pressed my hand when we parted Who
could have foretold me this The Indian raised the phial resolutely to
his lips He drank a few drops of the liquor it contained and replaced
it on a little ivory table close to Adriennes bed

This liquor is sharp and hot said he Now I am certain to die Oh
that I may still have time to feast on the sight and perfume of this
chamberto lay my dying head on the couch where she has reposed

Djalma fell on his knees beside the bed and leaned against it his
burning brow At this moment the ivory door which communicated with
the bathroom rolled gently on its hinges and Adrienne entered The
young lady had just sent away her woman who had assisted to undress
her She wore a long muslin wrapper of lustrous whiteness Her golden
hair neatly arranged in little plaits formed two bands which gave
to her sweet face an extremely juvenile air Her snowy complexion was
slightly tinged with rosecolor from the warmth of the perfumed bath
which she used for a few seconds every evening When she opened the
ivory door and placed her little naked foot in its white satin
slipper upon the ermine carpet Adrienne was dazzlingly beautiful
Happiness sparkled in her eyes and adorned her brow All the
difficulties relative to her union with Djalma had now been removed In
two days she would be his The sight of the nuptial chamber oppressed
her with a vague and ineffable languor The ivory door had been opened
so gently the ladys first steps were so soft upon the fur carpet that
Djalma still leaning against the bed had heard nothing But suddenly a
cry of surprise and alarm struck upon his ear He turned round abruptly
Adrienne stood before him

With an impulse of modesty Adrienne closed her nightdress over her
bosom and hastily drew back still more afflicted than angry at what
she considered a guilty attempt on the part of Djalma Cruelly hurt
and offended she was about to reproach him with his conduct when she
perceived the dagger which he had thrown down upon the ermine carpet
At sight of this weapon and the expression of fear and stupor which
petrified the features of Djalma who remained kneeling motionless
with his body thrown back hands stretched out his eyes fixed and
wildly staring Adrienne no longer dreading an amorous surprise was
seized with an indescribable terror and instead of flying from the
prince advanced several steps towards him and said in an agitated
voice whilst she pointed to the kandjiar My friend why are you here
what ails you why this dagger

Djalma made no answer At first the presence of Adrienne seemed to him
a vision which he attributed to the excitement of his brain already
it might be under the influence of the poison But when the soft voice
sounded in his earswhen his heart bounded with the species of electric
shock which he always felt when he met the gaze of that woman so
ardently belovedwhen he had contemplated for an instant that
adorable face so fresh and fair in spite of its expression of deep
uneasinessDjalma understood that he was not the sport of a dream but
that Mdlle de Cardoville was really before his eyes

Then as he began fully to grasp the thought that Adrienne was not dead
though he could not at all explain the prodigy of her resurrection the
Hindoos countenance was transfigured the pale gold of his complexion
became warm and red his eyes tarnished by tears of remorse shone with
new radiance and his features so lately contracted with terror and
despair expressed all the phases of the most ecstatic joy Advancing
still on his knees towards Adrienne he lifted up to her his trembling
hands and too deeply affected to pronounce a word he gazed on her
with so much amazement love adoration gratitude that the young lady
fascinated by those inexplicable looks remained mute also motionless
also and felt by the precipitate beating of her heart and by the
shudder which ran through her frame that there was here some dreadful
mystery to be unfolded

At last Djalma clasping his hands together exclaimed with an accent
impossible to describe Thou art not dead

Dead repeated the young lady in amazement

It was not thou really not thou whom I killed God is kind and just

And as he pronounced these words with intense joy the unfortunate youth
forgot the victim whom he had sacrificed in error

More and more alarmed and again glancing at the dagger en which she now
perceived marks of blooda terrible evidence in confirmation of the
words of DjalmaMdlle de Cardoville exclaimed You have killed some
one Djalma Oh what does he say It is dreadful

You are aliveI see youyou are here said Djalma in a voice
trembling with rapture You are herebeautiful pure for it was not
you Oh no had it been you the steel would have turned back upon
myself

You have killed some one cried the young lady beside her with this
unforeseen revelation and clasping her hands in horror Why whom did
you kill

I do not know A woman that was like youa man that I thought your
loverit was an illusion a frightful dreamyou are aliveyou are
here

And the oriental wept for joy

A dream but no it is not a dream There is blood upon that dagger
cried the young lady as she pointed wildly to the kandjiar I tell you
there is blood upon it

Yes I threw it down just now when I took the poison from it thinking
that I had killed you

The poison exclaimed Adrienne and her teeth chattered convulsively
What poison

I thought I had killed you and I came here to die

To die Oh wherefore who is to die cried the young lady almost in
delirium

I replied Djalma with inexpressible tenderness I thought I had
killed youand I took poison

You exclaimed Adrienne becoming pale as death You

Yes

Oh it is not true said the young lady shaking her head

Look said the Asiatic Mechanically he turned towards the
bedtowards the little ivory table on which sparkled the crystal
phial

With a sudden movement swifter than thought swifter it may be than
the will Adrienne rushed to the table seized the phial and applied it
eagerly to her lips

Djalma had hitherto remained on his knees but he now uttered a terrible
cry made one spring to the drinkers side and dragged away the phial
which seemed almost glued to her mouth

No matter I have swallowed as much as you said Adrienne with an air
of gloomy triumph

For an instant there followed an awful silence Adrienne and Djalma
gazed upon each other mute motionless horrorstruck The young lady
was the first to break this mournful silence and said in a tone which
she tried to make calm and steady Well what is there extraordinary in
this You have killed and death most expiate your crime It is just I
will not survive you That also is natural enough Why look at me thus
This poison has a sharp tastedoes it act quickly Tell me my Djalma

The prince did not answer Shuddering through all his frame he looked
down upon his hands Faringhea had told the truth a slight violet
tint appeared already beneath the nails Death was approaching slowly
almost insensibly but not the less certain Overwhelmed with despair
at the thought that Adrienne too was about to die Djalma felt his
courage fail him He uttered a long groan and hid his face in his
hands His knees shook under him and he felt down upon the bed near
which he was standing

Already cried the young lady in horror as she threw herself on her
knees at Djalmas feet Death already Do you hide your face from me

In her fright she pulled his hands from before his face That face was
bathed in tears

No not yet murmured he through his sobs The poison is slow

Really cried Adrienne with ineffable joy Then kissing the hands of
Djalma she added tenderly If the poison is slow why do you weep

For you for you said the Indian in a heartrending tone

Think not of me replied Adrienne resolutely You have killed and
we must expiate the crime I know not what has taken place but I swear
by our love that you did not do evil for evils sake There is some
horrible mystery in all this

On a pretence which I felt bound to believe replied Djalma speaking
quickly and panting for breath Faringhea led me to a certain house
Once there he told me that you had betrayed me I did not believe him
but I know not what strange dizziness seized upon meand then through
a halfobscurity I saw you

Me

Nonot youbut a woman resembling you dressed like you so that I
believed the illusionand then there came a manand you flew to meet
himand Imad with ragestabbed her stabbed him saw them falland
so came here to die And now I find you only to cause your death Oh
misery misery that you should die through me

And Djalma this man of formidable energy began again to weep with
the weakness of a child At sight of this deep touching passionate
despair Adrienne with that admirable courage which women alone possess
in love thought only of consoling Djalma By an effort of superhuman
passion as the prince revealed to her this infernal plot the ladys
countenance became so splendid with an expression of love and happiness
that the East Indian looked at her in amazement fearing for an instant
that he must have lost his reason

No more tears my adored cried the young lady exultingly No more
tearsbut only smiles of joy and love Our cruel enemies shall not
triumph

What do you say

They wished to make us miserable We pity them Our felicity shall be
the envy of the world

Adriennebethink you

Oh I have all my senses about me Listen to me my adored I now
understand it all Falling into a snare which these wretches spread for
you you have committed murder Now in this country murder leads to
infamy or the scaffoldand tomorrowtonight perhapsyou would be
thrown into prison But our enemies have said A man like Prince Djalma
does not wait for infamyhe kills himself A woman like Adrienne de
Cardoville does not survive the disgrace or death of her lovershe
prefers to die

Therefore a frightful death awaits them both said the blackrobed
men and that immense inheritance which we covet

And for youso young so beautiful so innocentdeath is frightful
and these monsters triumph cried Djalma They have spoken the truth

They have lied answered Adrienne Our death shall be celestial This
poison is slowand I adore you my Djalma

She spoke those words in a low voice trembling with passionate love
and leaning upon Djalmas knees approached so near that he felt her
warm breath upon his cheek As he felt that breath and saw the humid
flame that darted from the large swimming eyes of Adrienne whose half
opened lips were becoming of a still deeper and brighter hue the Indian
startedhis young blood boiled in his veinshe forgot everythinghis
despair and the approach of death which as yet as with Adrienne
only showed itself in a kind of feverish ardor His face like the young
girls became once more splendidly beautiful

Oh my lover my husband how beautiful you are said Adrienne with
idolatry Those eyesthat browthose lipshow I love themHow many
times has the remembrance of your grace and beauty coupled with your
love unsettled my reason and shaken my resolveseven to this moment
when I am wholly yoursYes heaven wills that we should be united
Only this morning I gave to the apostolic man that was to bless our
union in thy name and mine a royal gifta gift that will bring joy
and peace to the heart of many an unfortunate creature Then what have
we to regret my beloved Our immortal souls will pass away in a kiss
and ascend full of love to that God who is all love

Adrienne

Djalma

The light transparent curtains fell like a cloud over that nuptial and
funereal couch Yes funereal for two hours after Adrienne and Djalma
breathed their last sigh in a voluptuous agony




CHAPTER LXVI A DUEL TO THE DEATH

Adrienne and Djalma died on the 30th of May The following scene took
place on the 31st the eve of the day appointed for the last convocation
of the heirs of Marius de Rennepont The reader will no doubt remember
the room occupied by M Hardy in the house of retreat in the Rue de
Vaugirarda gloomy and retired apartment opening on a dreary little
garden planted with yewtrees and surrounded by high walls To reach
this chamber it was necessary to cross two vast rooms the doors of
which once shut intercepted all noise and communication from without
Bearing this in mind we may go on with our narrative For the last
three or four days Father dAigrigny occupied this apartment He had
not chosen it but had been induced to accept it under most plausible
pretexts given him at the instigation of Rodin It was about noon
Seated in an armchair by the window opening on the little garden
Father dAigrigny held in his hand a newspaper in which he read as
follows under the head of Paris

Eleven pmA most horrible and tragical event has just excited the
greatest consternation in the quarter of the Rue de Richelieu A double
murder has been committed on the person of a young man and woman
The girl was killed on the spot by the stroke of a dagger hopes are
entertained of saving the life of the young man The crime is attributed
to jealousy The officers of justice are investigating the matter We
shall give full particulars tomorrow

When he had read these lines Father dAigrigny threw down the paper and
remained in deep thought

It is incredible said he with bitter envy in allusion to Rodin He
has attained his end Hardly one of his anticipations has been defeated
This family is annihilated by the mere play of the passions good and
evil that he has known how to set in motion He said it would be so
Oh I must confess added Father dAigrigny with a jealous and hateful
smile that Rodin is a man of rare dissimulation patience energy
obstinacy and intelligence Who would have told a few months ago when
he wrote under my orders a discreet and humble socius that he had
already conceived the most audacious ambition and dared to lift his
eyes to the Holy See itself that thanks to intrigues and corruption
pursued with wondrous ability these views were not so unreasonable
Nay that this infernal ambition would soon be realized were it not
that the secret proceedings of this dangerous man have long been as
secretly watchedAh sneered Father dAigrigny with a smile of
irony and triumph you wish to be a second Sixtus V do you And
not content with this audacious pretension you mean if successful to
absorb our Company in the Papacy even as the Sultan has absorbed the
Janissaries Ah You would make us your steppingstone to power And you
have thought to humiliate and crush me with your insolent disdain But
patience patience the day of retribution approaches I alone am the
depository of our Generals will Father Caboccini himself does not
know that The fate of Rodin is in my hands Oh it will not be what he
expects In this Rennepont affair which I must needs confess he has
managed admirably he thinks to outwit us all and to work only for
himself But tomorrow

Father dAigrigny was suddenly disturbed in these agreeable reflections
He heard the door of the next room open and as he turned round to see
who was coming the door of the apartment in which he was turned upon
its hinges Father dAigrigny started with surprise and became almost
purple Marshal Simon stood before him And behind the marshal in the
shadow of the door Father dAigrigny perceived the cadaverous face
of Rodin The latter cast on him one glance of diabolical delight and
instantly disappeared The door was again closed and Father dAigrigny
and Marshal Simon were left alone together The father of Rose and
Blanche was hardly recognizable His gray hair had become completely
white His pale thin face had not been shaved for some days His hollow
eyes were bloodshot and restless and had in them something wild and
haggard He was wrapped in a large cloak and his black cravat was tied
loosely about his neck In withdrawing from the apartment Rodin had as
if by inadvertence doublelocked the door on the outside When he
was alone with the Jesuit the marshal threw back his cloak from his
shoulders and Father dAigrigny could see two naked swords stuck
through a silk handkerchief which served him as a belt

Father dAigrigny understood it all He remembered how a few days
before Rodin had obstinately pressed him to say what he would do if the
marshal were to strike him in the face There could be no doubt that
he who thought to have held the fate of Rodin in his hands had been
brought by the latter into a fearful peril for he knew that the two
outer rooms being closed there was no possibility of making himself
heard and that the high walls of the garden only bordered upon some
vacant lots The first thought which occurred to him one by no means
destitute of probability was that Rodin either by his agents at Rome
or by his own incredible penetration had learned that his fate
depended on Father dAigrigny and hoped therefore to get rid of him
by delivering him over to the inexorable vengeance of the father of
Rose and Blanche Without speaking a word the marshal unbound the
handkerchief from his waist laid the two swords upon the table
and folding his arms upon his breast advanced slowly towards Father
dAigrigny Thus these two men who through life had pursued each other
with implacable hatred at length met face to facethey who had fought
in hostile armies and measured swords in single combat and one of whom
now came to seek vengeance for the death of his children As the marshal
approached Father dAigrigny rose from his seat He wore that day a
black cassock which rendered still more visible the pale hue which had
now succeeded to the sudden flush on his cheek For a few seconds the
two men stood face to face without speaking The marshal was terrific
in his paternal despair His calmness inexorable as fate was more
impressive than the most furious burst of anger

My children are dead said he at last in a slow and hollow tone I
come to kill you

Sir cried Father dAigrigny listen to me Do not believe

I must kill you resumed the marshal interrupting the Jesuit your
hate followed my wife into exile where she perished You and your
accomplices sent my children to certain death For twenty years you have
been my evil genius I must have your life and I will have it

My life belongs first to God answered Father dAigrigny piously
and then to who likes to take it

We will fight to the death in this room said the marshal and as I
have to avenge my wife and children I am tranquil as to the result

Sir answered Father dAigrigny coldly you forget that my
profession forbids me to fight Once I accepted your challengebut my
position is changed since then

Ah said the marshal with a bitter smile you refuse to fight
because you are a priest

Yes sirbecause I am a priest

So that because he is a priest a wretch like you may commit any
crime any baseness under shelter of his black gown

I do not understand a word of your accusations In any case the law is
open said Father dAigrigny biting his pale lips for he felt deeply
the insult offered by the marshal if you have anything to complain of
appeal to that law before which all are equal

Marshal Simon shrugged his shoulders in angry disdain Your crimes
escape the lawand could it even reach you that would not satisfy my
vengeance after all the evil you have done me after all you have taken
from me said the marshal and at the memory of his children his
voice slightly trembled but he soon proceeded with terrible calmness
You must feel that I now only live for vengeance And I must have
such revenge as is worth the seekingI must have your cowards heart
palpitating on the point of my sword Our last duel was play this will
be earnestoh you shall see

The marshal walked up to the table where he had laid the two swords
Father dAigrigny needed all his resolution to restrain himself The
implacable hate which he had always felt for Marshal Simon added to
these insults filled him with savage ardor Yet he answered in a tone
that was still calm For the last time sir I repeat to you that my
profession forbids me to fight

Then you refuse said the marshal turning abruptly towards him

I refuse

Positively

Positively Nothing on earth should force me to it

Nothing

No sir nothing

We shall see said the marshal as his hand fell with its full force
on the cheek of Father dAigrigny

The Jesuit uttered a cry of fury all his blood rushed to his face so
roughly handled the courage of the man for he was brave his ancient
military ardor carried him away his eyes sparkled and with teeth
firmly set and clenched fists he advanced towards the marshal
exclaiming The swords the swords

But suddenly remembering the appearance of Rodin and the interest
which the latter had in bringing about this encounter he determined to
avoid the diabolical snare laid by his former socius and so gathered
sufficient resolution to restrain his terrible resentment

To his passing fury succeeded a calm full of contrition and wishing
to play his part out to the end he knelt down and bowing his head
and beating his bosom repeated Forgive me Lord for yielding to a
movement of rage and above all forgive him who has injured me

In spite of his apparent resignation the Jesuits voice was neatly
agitated He seemed to feel a hot iron upon his cheek for never before
in his life whether as a soldier or a priest had he suffered such
an insult He had thrown himself upon his knees partly from religious
mummery and partly to avoid the gaze of the marshal fearing that were
he to meet his eye he should not be able to answer for himself but
give way to his impetuous feelings On seeing the Jesuit kneel down and
on hearing his hypocritical invocation the marshal whose sword was in
his hand shook with indignation

Stand up scoundrel he said stand up wretch And he spurned the
Jesuit with his boot

At this new insult Father dAigrigny leaped up as if he had been moved
by steel springs It was too much he could bear no more Blinded with
rage he rushed to the able caught up the other sword and exclaimed
grinding his teeth together Ah you will have blood Well then it
shall be yoursif possible

And the Jesuit still in all the vigor of manhood his face purple his
large gray eyes sparkling with hate fell upon his guard with the ease
and skill of a finished swordsman

At last cried the marshal as their blades were about to cross

But once more reflection came to damp the fire of the Jesuit He
remembered how this hazardous duel would gratify the wishes of Rodin
whose fate was in his hands and whom he hated perhaps even more than
the marshal Therefore in spite of the fury which possessed him
in spite of his secret hope to conquer in this combat so strong and
healthy did he feel himself and so fatal had been the effects of grief
on the constitution of Marshal Simon he succeeded in mastering his
rage and to the amazement of the marshal dropped the point of his
sword exclaiming I am a minister of the Lord and must not shed
blood Forgive ne heaven and oh forgive my brother also

Then placing the blade beneath his heel he drew the hilt suddenly
towards him and broke the weapon into two pieces The duel was no
longer possible Father dAigrigny had put it out of his own power to
yield to a new burst of violence of which he saw the imminent danger
Marshal Simon remained for an instant mute and motionless with surprise
and indignation for he also saw that the duel was now impossible But
suddenly imitating the Jesuit the marshal placed his blade also
under his heel broke it in half and picking up the pointed end about
eighteen inches in length tore off his black silk cravat rolled
it round the broken part so as to form a handle and said to Father
dAigrigny Then we will fight with daggers

Struck with this mixture of coolness and ferocity the Jesuit exclaimed
Is this then a demon of hell

No it is a father whose children have been murdered said the
marshal in a hollow voice whilst he fitted the blade to his hand and
a tear stood in the eye that instantly after became fierce and ardent

The Jesuit saw that tear There was in this mixture of vindictive rage
and paternal grief something so awful and yet so sacred that for the
first time in his life Father dAigrigny felt fearcowardly ignoble
fearfear for his own safety While a combat with swords was in
question in which skill agility and experience are such powerful
auxiliaries to courage his only difficulty had been to repress the
ardor of his hatebut when he thought of the combat proposed body
to body face to face heart to heart he trembled grew pale and
exclaimed A butchery with knivesnever

His countenance and the accent betrayed his alarm so that the marshal
himself was struck with it and fearing to lose his revenge he cried
After all he is a coward The wretch had only the courage or
the vanity of a fencer This pitiful renegadethis traitor to
his countrywhom I have cuffed kickedyes kicked most noble
marquisshame of your ancient housedisgrace to the rank of
gentleman old or newah it is not hypocrisy it is not calculation
as I at first thoughtit is fear You need the noise of war and the
eyes of spectators to give you courage

Sirhave a care said Father dAigrigny stammering through his
clenched teeth for rage and hate now made him forget his fearMust I
then spit on you to make the little blood you have left rise to your
face cried the exasperated marshal

Oh this is too much too much said the Jesuit seizing the pointed
piece of the blade that lay at his feet

It is not enough said the marshal panting for breath There
Judas and he spat in his face

If you will not fight now added the marshal I will beat you like a
dog base childmurderer

On receiving the uttermost insult which can be offered to an already
insulted man Father dAigrigny lost all his presence of mind forgot
his interests his resolutions his fears forgot even Rodinfelt only
the frenzied ardor of revengeand recovering his courage rejoiced
in the prospect of a close struggle in which his superior strength
promised success over the enfeebled frame of the marshal for in this
kind of brutal and savage combat physical strength offers an immense
advantage In an instant Father dAigrigny had rolled his handkerchief
round the broken blade and rushed upon Marshal Simon who received the
shock with intrepidity For the short time that this unequal struggle
lastedunequal for the marshal had since some days been a prey to a
devouring fever which had undermined his strengththe two combatants
mute in their fury uttered not a word or a cry Had any one been
present at this horrible scene it would have been impossible for him
to tell how they dealt their blows He would have seen two
headsfrightful livid convulsedrising falling now here
now therearms now stiff as bars of iron and now twisting like
serpentsand in the midst of the undulation of the blue coat of the
marshal and the black cassock of the Jesuit from time to time the
sudden gleam of the steel He would have heard only a dull stamping
and now and then a deep breath In about two minutes at most the two
adversaries fell and rolled one over the other One of themit was
Father dAigrignycontrived to disengage himself with a violent effort
and to rise upon his knees His arms fell powerless by his side and
then the dying voice of the marshal murmured My children Dagobert

I have killed him said Father dAigrigny in a weak voice but I
feelthat I am woundedto death

Leaning with one hand on the ground the Jesuit pressed the other to
his bosom His black cassock was pierced through and through but the
blades which had served for the combat being triangular and very
sharp the blood instead of issuing from the wounds was flowing
inwards

Oh I dieI choke said Father dAigrigny whose features were
already changing with the approach of death

At this moment the key turned twice in the door Rodin appeared on the
threshold and thrusting in his head he said in a humble and discreet
voice May I come in

At this dreadful irony Father dAigrigny strove to rise and rush upon
Rodin but he fell back exhausted the blood was choking him

Monster of hell he muttered casting on Rodin a terrible glance of
rage and agony Thou art the cause of my death

I always told you my dear father that your old military habits would
be fatal to you answered Rodin with a frightful smile Only a few
days ago I gave you warning and advised you take a blow patiently from
this old swordsmanwho seems to have done with that work forever which
is wellfor the Scripture says All they that take the sword shall
perish with the sword And then this Marshal Simon might have had some
claim on his daughters inheritance And between ourselves my dear
father what was I to do It was necessary to sacrifice you for the
common interest the rather that I well knew what you had in pickle for
me tomorrow But I am not so easily caught napping

Before I die said Father dAigrigny in a failing voice I will
unmask you

Oh no you will not said Rodin shaking his head with a knowing air
I alone if you please will receive your last confession

Oh this is horrible moaned Father dAigrigny whose eyes were
closing May God have mercy on me if it is not too lateAlas at
this awful moment I feel that I have been a great sinner

And above all a great fool said Rodin shrugging his shoulders and
watching with cold disdain the dying moments of his accomplice

Father dAigrigny had now but a few minutes more to live Rodin
perceived it and said It is time to call for help And the Jesuit
ran with an air of alarm and consternation into the courtyard of the
house

Others came at his cries but as he had promised Rodin had only
quitted Father dAigrigny as the latter had breathed his last sigh

That evening alone in his chamber by the glimmer of a little lamp
Rodin sat plunged in a sort of ecstatic contemplation before the print
representing Sixtus V The great houseclock struck twelve At the last
stroke Rodin drew himself up in all the savage majesty of his infernal
triumph and exclaimed This is the first of June There are no more
RennepontsMethinks I hear the hour from the clock of St Peters at
Rome striking




CHAPTER LXVII A MESSAGE

While Rodin sat plunged in ambitious reverie contemplating the portrait
of Sixtus V good little Father Caboccini whose warm embraces had
so much irritated the first mentioned personage went secretly to
Faringhea to deliver to him a fragment of an ivory crucifix and
said to him with his usual air of jovial goodnature His Excellency
Cardinal Malipieri on my departure from Rome charged me to give you
this only on the 31st of May

The halfcaste who was seldom affected by anything started abruptly
almost with an expression of pain His face darkened and bending upon
the little father a piercing look he said to him You were to add
something

True replied Father Caboccini the words I was to add are these
There is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip

It is well said the other Heaving a deep sigh he joined the
fragment of the ivory crucifix to a piece already in his possession it
fitted exactly

Father Caboccini looked at him with curiosity for the cardinal had only
told him to deliver the ivory fragment to Faringhea and to repeat the
above words Being somewhat mystified with all this the reverend father
said to the halfcaste What are you going to do with that crucifix

Nothing said Faringhea still absorbed in painful thought

Nothing resumed the reverend father in astonishment What then
was the use of bringing it so far

Without satisfying his curiosity Faringhea replied At what hour to
morrow does Father Rodin go to the Rue Saint Francois

Very early

Before leaving home he will go to say prayers in the chapel

Yes according to the habit of our reverend fathers

You sleep near him

Being his socius I occupy the room next to his

It is possible said Faringhea after a moments silence that the
reverend father full of the great interests which occupy his mind
might forget to go to the chapel In that case pray remind him of this
pious duty

I shall not fail

Pray do not fail repeated Faringhea anxiously

Be satisfied said the good little father I see that you take great
interest in his salvation

Great interest

It is very praiseworthy in you Continue as you have begun and you
may one day belong completely to our Company said Father Caboccini
affectionately

I am as yet but a poor auxiliary member said Faringhea humbly but
no one is more devoted to the Society body and soul Bowanee is nothing
to it

Bowanee who is that my good friend

Bowanee makes corpses which rot in the ground The Society makes
corpses which walk about

Ah yes Perinde ac cadaverthey were the last words of our great
saint Ignatius de Loyola But who is this Bowanee

Bowanee is to the Society what a child is to a man replied the
Asiatic with growing excitement Glory to the Companyglory Were my
father its enemy I would kill my father The man whose genius inspires
me most with admiration respect and terrorwere he its enemy I would
kill in spite of all said the halfcaste with an effort Then after
a moments silence he looked full in Caboccinis face and added I
say this that you may report my words to Cardinal Malipieri and beg
him to mention them to

Faringhea stopped short To whom should the cardinal mention your
words asked Caboccini

He knows replied the halfcaste abruptly Good night

Goodnight my friend I can only approve of your excellent sentiments
with regard to our Company Alas it is in want of energetic defenders
for there are said to be traitors in its bosom

For those said Faringhea we must have no pity

Certainly said the good little father we understand one another

Perhaps said the halfcaste Do not at all events forget to remind
Father Rodin to go to chapel tomorrow morning

I will take care of that said Father Caboccini

The two men parted On his return to the house Caboccini learned that
a courier only arrived that night from Rome had brought despatches to
Rodin




CHAPTER LXVIII THE FIRST OF JUNE

The chapel belonging to the house of the reverend fathers in the Rue de
Vaugirard was gay and elegant Large panes of stained glass admitted
a mysterious light the altar shone with gold and silver and at the
entrance of this little church in an obscure corner beneath the organ
loft was a font for holy water in sculptured marble It was close to
this font in a dark nook where he could hardly be seen that Faringhea
knelt down early on the 1st of June as soon indeed as the chapel doors
were opened The halfcaste was exceedingly sad From time to time he
started and sighed as if agitated by a violent internal struggle
This wild untamable being possessed with the monomania of evil and
destruction felt as may be imagined a profound admiration for Rodin
who exercised over him a kind of magnetic fascination The halfcaste
almost a wild beast in human form saw something supernatural in the
infernal genius of Rodin And the latter too sagacious not to have
discovered the savage devotion of this wretch had made as we have
seen good use of him is bringing about the tragical termination of the
loves of Adrienne and Djalma But what excited to an incredible degree
the admiration of Faringhea was what he knew of the Society of
Jesus This immense occult power which undermined the world by its
subterraneous ramifications and reached its ends by diabolical means
had inspired the halfcaste with a wild enthusiasm And if anything in
the world surpassed his fanatical admiration for Rodin it was his blind
devotion to the Company of Ignatius de Loyola which as he said could
make corpses that walk about Hid in the shadow of the organloft
Faringhea was reflecting deeply on these things when footsteps were
heard and Rodin entered the chapel accompanied by his socius the
little oneeyed father

Whether from absence of mind or that the shadow of the orangeloft
completely concealed the halfcaste Rodin dipped his fingers into the
font without perceiving Faringhea who stood motionless as a statue
though a cold sweat streamed from his brow The prayer of Rodin was
as may be supposed short he was in haste to get to the Rue
SaintFrancois After kneeling down with Father Caboccini for a few
seconds he rose bowed respectfully to the altar and returned towards
the door followed by his socius At the moment Rodin approached the
font he perceived the tall figure of the halfcaste standing out from
the midst of the dark shadow advancing a little Faringhea bowed
respectfully to Rodin who said to him in a low voice Come to me at
two oclock

So saying Rodin stretched forth his hand to dip it into the holy water
but Faringhea spared him the trouble by offering him the sprinkling
brush which generally stood in the font

Pressing between his dirty fingers the damp hairs of the brush
which the halfcaste held by the handle Rodin wetted his thumb and
forefinger and according to custom traced the sign of the cross upon
his forehead Then opening the door of the chapel he went out after
again repeating to Faringhea Come to me at two oclock

Thinking he would also make use of the sprinklingbrush which
Faringhea still motionless held with a trembling hand Father
Caboccini stretched out his fingers to reach it when the halfbreed
as if determined to confine his favors to Rodin hastily withdrew the
instrument Deceived in his expectation Father Caboccini lost no time
in following Rodin whom he was not to leave that day for a single
moment and getting into a hackneycoach with him set out for the Rue
SaintFrancois It is impossible to describe the look which the half
breed fixed upon Rodin as the latter quitted the chapel Left alone in
the sacred edifice Faringhea sank upon the stones half kneeling half
crouching with his face buried in his hands As the coach drew near
the quarter of the Marais in which was situated the house of Marius
de Rennepont a feverish agitation and the devouring impatience of
triumph were visible on the countenance of Rodin Two or three times he
opened his pocketbook and read and arranged the different certificates
of death of the various members of the Rennepont family and from time
to time he thrust his head anxiously from the coachwindow as if he had
wished to hasten the slow progress of the vehicle

The good little father his socius did not take his eye off Rodin and
his look had a strange and crafty expression At last the coach entered
the Rue SaintFrancois and stopped before the ironstudded door of the
old house which had been closed for a century and a half Rodin sprang
from the coach with the agility of a young man and knocked violently
at the door whilst Father Caboccini less light of foot descended more
prudently to the ground No answer was returned to the loud knocking
of Rodin Trembling with anxiety he knocked again This time as he
listened attentively he heard slow steps approaching They stopped at
some distance from the door which was not yet opened

It is keeping one upon redhot coals said Rodin for he felt as
if there was a burning fire in his chest He again shook the door
violently and began to gnaw his nails according to his custom

Suddenly the door opened and Samuel the Jew guardian appeared beneath
the porch The countenance of the old man expressed bitter grief Upon
his venerable cheeks were the traces of recent tears which he strove to
dry with his trembling hands as he opened the door to Rodin

Who are you gentlemen said Samuel

I am the bearer of a power of attorney from the Abbe Gabriel the only
living representative of the Rennepont family answered Rodin
hastily This gentleman is my secretary added he pointing to Father
Caboccini who bowed

After looking attentively at Rodin Samuel resumed I recognize you
sir Please to follow me And the old guardian advanced towards the
house in the garden making a sign to the two reverend fathers to
follow

That confounded old man kept me so long at the door said Rodin to his
socius that I think I have caught a cold in consequence My lips and
throat are dried up like parchment baked at the fire

Will you not take something my dear good father Suppose you were to
ask this man for a glass of water cried the little oneeyed priest
with tender solicitude

No no answered Rodin it is nothing I am devoured by impatience
That is all

Pale and desolate Bathsheba the wife of Samuel was standing at the
door of the apartment she occupied with her husband in the building
next the street As the Jew passed before her he said in Hebrew The
curtains of the Hall of Mourning

Are closed

And the iron casket

Is prepared answered Bathsheba also in Hebrew

After pronouncing these words completely unintelligible to Rodin
and Caboccini Samuel and Bathsheba exchanged a bitter smile
notwithstanding the despair impressed on their countenances

Ascending the steps followed by the two reverend fathers Samuel
entered the vestibule of the house in which a lamp was burning Endowed
with an excellent local memory Rodin was about to take the direction
of the Red Saloon in which had been held the first convocation of the
heirs when Samuel stopped him and said It is not that way

Then taking the lamp he advanced towards a dark staircase for the
windows of the house had not been unbricked

But said Rodin the last time we met in a saloon on the ground
floor

Today we must go higher answered Samuel as he began slowly to
ascend the stairs

Where to higher said Rodin following him

To the Hall of Mourning replied the Jew and he continued to ascend

What is the Hall of Mourning resumed Rodin in some surprise

A place of tears and death answered the Israelite and he kept on
ascending through the darkness for the little lamp threw but a faint
light around

But said Rodin more and more astonished and stopping short on the
stairs why go to this place

The money is there answered Samuel and he went on

Oh if the money is there that alters the case replied Rodin and he
made haste to regain the few steps he had lost by stopping

Samuel continued to ascend and at a turn of the staircase the two
Jesuits could see by the pale light of the little lamp the profile of
the old Israelite in the space left between the iron balustrade and the
wall as he climbed on with difficulty above them Rodin was struck with
the expression of Samuels countenance His black eyes generally
so calm sparkled with ardor His features usually impressed with a
mixture of sorrow intelligence and goodness seemed to grow harsh and
stern and his thin lips wore a strange smile

It is not so very high whispered Rodin to Caboccini and yet my legs
ache and I am quite out of breath There is a strange throbbing too in
my temples

In fact Rodin breathed hard and with difficulty To this confidential
communication good little Father Caboccini in general so full of
tender care for his colleague made no answer He seemed to be in deep
thought

Will we soon be there said Rodin impatiently to Samuel

We are there replied the Israelite

And a good thing too said Rodin

Very good said the Jew

Stopping in the midst of a corridor he pointed with the hand in which
he held the lamp to a large door from which streamed a faint light In
spite of his growing surprise Rodin entered resolutely followed
by Father Caboccini and Samuel The apartment in which these three
personage now found themselves was very large The daylight only
entered from a belvedere in the roof the four sides of which had been
covered with leaden plates each of which was pierced with seven holes
forming a cross thus

 
   
 
 
 

Now the light being only admitted through these holes the obscurity
would have been complete had it not been for a lamp which burned on a
large massive slab of black marble fixed against one of the walls
One would have taken it for a funeral chamber for it was all hung with
black curtains fringed with white There was no furniture save the
slab of black marble we have already mentioned On this slab was an iron
casket of the manufacture of the seventeenth century admirably adorned
with open work like lace made of metal

Addressing Rodin who was wiping his forehead with his dirty
handkerchief and looking round him with surprise but not fear Samuel
said to him The will of the testator however strange it may appear
is sacred with me and must be accomplished in all things

Certainly said Rodin but what are we to do here

You will know presently sir You are the representative of the only
remaining heir of the Rennepont family the Abbe Gabriel de Rennepont

Yes sir and here are my papers replied Rodin

To save time resumed Samuel I will previous to the arrival of the
magistrate go through the inventory of the securities contained in
this casket which I withdrew yesterday from the custody of the Bank of
France

The securities are there cried Rodin advancing eagerly towards the
casket

Yes sir replied Samuel as by the list Your secretary will call
them over and I will produce each in turn They can then be replaced
in the casket which I will deliver up to you in presence of the
magistrate

All this seems perfectly correct said Rodin

Samuel delivered the list to Father Caboccini and approaching the
casket touched a spring which was not seen by Rodin The heavy lid
flew open and while Father Caboccini read the names of the different
securities Samuel showed them to Rodin who returned them to the old
Jew after a careful examination This verification did not last long
for this immense fortune was all comprised as we already know in eight
government securities five hundred thousand francs in banknote
thirty five thousand francs in gold and two hundred and fifty francs in
silvermaking in all an amount of two hundred and twelve millions one
hundred and seventyfive thousand francs When Rodin had counted the
last of the five hundred banknotes of a thousand francs each he
said as he returned them to Samuel It is quite right Two hundred and
twelve millions one hundred and seventyfive thousand francs

He was no doubt almost choked with joy for he breathed with difficulty
his eyes closed and he was obliged to lean upon Father Caboccinis arm
as he said to him in an altered voice It is singular I thought myself
proof against all such emotions but what I feel is extraordinary

The natural paleness of the Jesuit increased so much and he seemed
so much agitated with convulsive movements that Father Caboccini
exclaimed My dear father collect yourself do not let success
overcome you thus

Whilst the little oneeyed man was attending to Rodin Samuel carefully
replaced the securities in the iron casket Thanks to his unconquerable
energy and to the joy he felt at seeing himself so near the term of his
labors Rodin mastered this attack of weakness and drawing himself up
calm and proud he said to Caboccini It is nothing I did not survive
the cholera to die of joy on the first of June

And though still frightfully pale the countenance of the Jesuit shone
with audacious confidence But now when Rodin appeared to be quite
recovered Father Caboccini seemed suddenly transformed Though short
fat and oneeyed his features assumed on the instant so firm harsh
and commanding an expression that Rodin recoiled a step as he looked at
him Then Father Caboccini drawing a paper from his pocket kissed it
respectfully glanced sternly at Rodin and read as follows in a severe
and menacing tone

On receipt of the present rescript the Reverend Father Rodin will
deliver up all his powers to the Reverend Father Caboccini who is
alone commissioned with the Reverend Father dAigrigny to receive the
inheritance of the Rennepont family if in His eternal justice
the Lord should restore this property of which our Company has been
wronged

Moreover on receipt of the present rescript the Reverend Father
Rodin in charge of a person to be named by the Reverend Father
Caboccini shall be conveyed to our house in the Town of Laval to be
kept in strict seclusion in his cell until further orders

Then Father Caboccini handed the rescript to Rodin that the latter
might read the signature of the General of the Company Samuel greatly
interested by this scene drew a few steps nearer leaving the casket
halfopen Suddenly Rodin burst into a loud laugha laugh of joy
contempt and triumph impossible to describe Father Caboccini looked
at him with angry astonishment when Rodin growing still more imperious
and haughty and with an air of more sovereign disdain than ever pushed
aside the paper with the back of his dirty hand and said What is the
date of that scribble

The eleventh of May answered Father Caboccini in amazement

Here is a brief that I received last night from Rome under date of
the eighteenth It informs me that I am appointed GENERAL OF THE ORDER
Read

Father Caboccini took the paper read it and remained thunderstruck
Then returning it humbly to Rodin he respectfully bent his knee before
him Thus seemed the ambitious views of Rodin accomplished In spite of
the hatred and suspicion of that party of which Cardinal Malipieri was
the representative and the chief Rodin by address and craft audacity
and persuasion and in consequence of the high esteem in which his
partisans at Rome held his rare capacity had succeeded in deposing his
General and in procuring his own elevation to that eminent post Now
according to his calculation aided by the millions he was about to
possess it would be but one step from that post to the pontifical
throne A mute witness of this scene Samuel smiled also with an air of
triumph as he closed the casket by means of the spring known only to
himself That metallic sound recalled Rodin from the heights of his
mad ambition to the realities of life and he said to Samuel in a sharp
voice You have heard These millions must be delivered to me alone

He extended his hands eagerly and impatiently towards the casket as
if he would have taken possession of it before the arrival of the
magistrate Then Samuel in his turn seemed transfigured and folding
his arms upon his breast and drawing up his aged form to its full
height he assumed a threatening and imposing air His eyes flashed with
indignation and he said in a solemn tone This fortuneat first the
humble remains of the inheritance of the most noble of men whom the
plots of the sons of Loyola drove to suicidethis fortune which has
since become royal in amount thanks to the sacred probity of three
generations of faithful servantsthis fortune shall never be the reward
of falsehood hypocrisy and murder No the eternal justice of heaven
will not allow it

On murder what do you mean sir asked Rodin boldly

Samuel made no answer He stamped his foot and extended his arm slowly
towards the extremity of the apartment Then Rodin and Father Caboccini
beheld an awful spectacle The draperies on the wall were drawn aside
as if by an invisible hand Round a funeral vault faintly illuminedby
the bluish light of a silver lamp six dead bodies were ranged
upon black biers dressed in long black robes They were Jacques
RennepontFrancois HardyRose and Blanche SimonAdrienne and Djalma
They appeared to be asleep Their eyelids were closed their hands
crossed over their breasts Father Caboccini trembling in every limb
made the sign of the cross and retreating to the opposite wall buried
his face in his hands Rodin on the contrary with agitated countenance
staring eyes and hair standing on end yielding to an invincible
attraction advanced towards those inanimate forms One would have said
that these last of the Renneponts had only just expired They seemed to
be in the first hour of the eternal sleep44

Behold those whom thou host slain cried Samuel in a voice broken
with sobs Yea your detestable plots caused their deathand as they
fell one by one it was my pious care to obtain possession of their
poor remains that they may all repose in the same sepulchre
Ohcursedcursedcursedbe thou who has killed them But their
spoils shall escape thy murderous hands

Rodin still drawn forward in spite of himself had approached the
funeral couch of Djalma Surmounting his first alarm the Jesuit to
assure himself that he was not the sport of frightful dream ventured
to touch the hands of the Asiaticand found that they were damp and
pliant though cold as ice

The Jesuit drew back in horror For some seconds he trembled
convulsively But his first amazement over reflection returned and
with reflection came that invincible energy that infernal obstinacy of
character that gave him so much power Steadying himself on his legs
drawing his hand across his brow raising his head moistening his lips
two or three times before he spokefor his throat and mouth grew
ever drier and hotter without his being able to explain the causehe
succeeded in giving to his features an imperious and ironical
expression and turning towards Samuel who wept in silence he said to
him in a hoarse guttural voice I need not show you the certificates
of their death There they are in person And he pointed with his bony
hand to the six dead bodies

At these words of his General Father Caboccini again made the sign of
the cross as if he had seen a fiend

Oh my God cried Samuel Thou hast quite abandoned this man With
what a calm look he contemplates his victims

Come sir said Rodin with a horrid smile this is a natural waxwork
exhibition that is all My calmness proves my innocenceand we had
best come at once to business I have an appointment at two oclock So
let us carry down this casket

He advanced towards the marble slab Seized with indignation and horror
Samuel threw himself before him and pressing with all his might on a
knob in the lid of the casketa knob which yielded to the pressurehe
exclaimed Since your infernal soul is incapable of remorse it may
perhaps be shaken by disappointed avarice

What does he say cried Rodin What is he doing

Look said Samuel in his turn assuming an air of savage triumph I
told you that the spoils of your victims should escape your murderous
hands

Hardly had he uttered these words before through the openwork of the
iron casket rose a light cloud of smoke and an odor as of burnt paper
spread itself through the room Rodin understood it instantly Fire
he exclaimed as he rushed forward to seize the casket It had been made
fast to the heavy marble slab

Yes fire said Samuel In a few minutes of that immense treasure
there will remain nothing but ashes And better so than that it should
belong to you or yours This treasure is not mine and it only remains
for me to destroy itsince Gabriel de Rennepont will be faithful to the
oath he has taken

Help water water cried Rodin as he covered the casket with his
body trying in vain to extinguish the flames which fanned by the
current of air now issued from the thousand apertures in the lid but
soon the intensity of the fire diminished a few threads of bluish smoke
alone mounted upwardsand then all was extinct

The work was done Breathless and faint Rodin leaned against the marble
slab For the first time in his life he wept large tears of rage
rolled down his cadaverous cheeks But suddenly dreadful pains at
first dull but gradually augmenting in intensity seized on him with so
much fury though he employed all his energy to struggle against them
that he fell on his knees and pressing his two hands to his chest
murmured with an attempt to smile It is nothing Do not be alarmed A
few spasmsthat is all The treasure is destroyedbut I remain General
of the Order Oh I suffer What a furnace he added writhing in
agony Since I entered this cursed house I know not what ails me
IfI had not lived on rootswaterbreadwhich I go myself to buyI
should thinkI was poisonedfor I triumphand Cardinal Malipieri has
long arms YesI still triumphfor I will not diethis time no more
than the otherI will not die

Then as he stretched out his arms convulsively he continued It is
fire that devours my entrails No doubt they have tried to poison me
But when but how

After another pause Rodin again cried out in a stifled voice Help
help me you that stand looking onlike spectresHelp me I say

Horrorstruck at this dreadful agony Samuel and Father Caboccini were
unable to stir

Help repeated Rodin in a tone of strangulation This poison is
horribleBut how Then with a terrific cry of rage as if a sudden
idea had struck him he exclaimed Ha Faringheathis morningthe
holy waterhe knows such subtle poisons Yesit is hehe had an
interview with Malipieri The demonOh it was well played The
Borgias are still the same Oh it is all over I die They will regret
me the foolsOh hell hell The Church knows not its lossbut I
burnhelp

They came to his assistance Quick steps were heard upon the stairs and
Dr Baleinier followed by the Princess de SaintDizier appeared at the
entrance of the Hall of Mourning The princess had learned vaguely that
morning the death of Father dAigrigny and had come to question Rodin
upon the subject When this woman entering the room suddenly saw the
frightful spectacle that offered itself to her viewwhen she saw
Rodin writhing in horrible agony and further on by the light of the
sepulchral lamp those six corpsesand amongst them her own niece
and the two orphans whom she had sent to meet their deathshe stood
petrified with horror and her reason was unable to withstand the shock
She looked slowly round her and then raised her arms on high and burst
into a wild fit of laughter She had gone mad Whilst Dr Baleinier
supported the head of Rodin who expired in his arms Faringhea appeared
at the door remaining in the shade he cast a ferocious glance at
the corpse of the Jesuit He would have made himself the chief of the
Company of Jesus to destroy it said he with me the Company of
Jesus stands in the place of Bowanee I have obeyed the cardinal

EPILOGUE




CHAPTER I FOUR YEARS AFTER

Four years had elapsed since the events we have just related
when Gabriel de Rennepont wrote the following letter to Abbe Joseph
Charpentier curate of the Parish of SaintAubin a hamlet of Sologne

Springwater Farm June 2d 1836

Intending to write to you yesterday my bear Joseph I seated myself
at the little old black table that you will remember well My window
looks you know upon the farmyard and I can see all that takes place
there These are grave preliminaries my friend but I am coming to the
point I had just taken my seat at the table when looking from the
window this is what I saw You my dear Joseph who can draw so well
should have been there to have sketched the charming scene The sun was
sinking the sky serene the air warm and balmy with the breath of the
hawthorn which flowering by the side of a little rivulet forms the
edge which borders the yard Under the large peartree close to the
wall of the barn sat upon the stone bench my adopted father Dagobert
that brave and honest soldier whom you love so much He appeared
thoughtful his white head was bowed on his bosom with absent mind
he patted old Spoilsport whose intelligent face was resting on his
masters knees By his side was his wife my dear adopted mother
occupied with her sewing and near them on a stool sat Angela
the wife of Agricola nursing her lastborn child while the gentle
Magdalen with the eldest boy in her lap was occupied in teaching him
the letters of the alphabet Agricola had just returned from the fields
and was beginning to unyoke his cattle when struck like me no doubt
with this picture he stood gazing on it for a moment with his hand
still leaning on the yoke beneath which bent submissive the broad
foreheads of his two large black oxen I cannot express to you my
friend the enchanting repose of this picture lighted by the last rays
of the sun here and there broken by the thick foliage What various
and touching types The venerable face of the soldierthe good loving
countenance of my adopted motherthe fresh beauty of Angela smiling
on her little childthe soft melancholy of the hunchback now and
then pressing her lips to the fair laughing cheek of Agricolas eldest
sonand then Agricola himself in his manly beauty which seems to
reflect so well the valor and honesty of his heart Oh my Friend
in contemplating this assemblage of good devoted noble and loving
beings so dear to each other living retired in a little farm of our
poor Sologne my heart rose towards heaven with a feeling of ineffable
gratitude This peace of the family circlethis clear evening with the
perfume of the woods and wild flowers wafted on the breezethis deep
silence only broken by the murmur of the neighboring rillall affected
me with one of these passing fits of vague and sweet emotion which
one feels but cannot express You well know it my friend who in your
solitary walks in the midst of your immense plains of flowering heath
surrounded by forests of fir trees often feel your eyes grow moist
without being able to explain the cause of that sweet melancholy which
I too have often felt during those glorious nights passed in the
profound solitudes of America

But alas a painful incident disturbed the serenity of the picture
Suddenly I heard Dagoberts wife say to him My dearyou are weeping

At these words Agricola Angela and Magdalen gathered round the
soldier Anxiety was visible upon every face Then as he raised his
head abruptly one could see two large tears trickle down his cheek to
his white moustache It is nothing my children said he in a voice
of emotion it is nothing Only today is the first of Juneand this
day four years He could not complete the sentence and as he raised
his hands to his eyes to brush away the tears we saw that he held
between his fingers a little bronze chain with a medal suspended to it
That is his dearest relic Four years ago almost dying with despair at
the loss of the two angels of whom I have so often spoken to you my
friend he took from the neck of Marshal Simon brought home dead from a
fatal duel this chain and medal which his children had so long worn
I went down instantly as you may suppose to endeavor to soothe the
painful remembrances of this excellent man gradually he grew calmer
and the evening was passed in a pious and quiet sadness

You cannot imagine my friend when I returned to my chamber what
cruel thoughts came to my mind as I recalled those past events from
which I generally turn away with fear and horror Then I saw once more
the victims of those terrible and mysterious plots the awful depths of
which have never been penetrated thanks to the death of Father dA
and Father R and the incurable madness of Madame de StD the three
authors or accomplices of the dreadful deeds The calamities occasioned
by them are irreparable for those who were thus sacrificed to a
criminal ambition would have been the pride of humanity by the good
they would have done Ah my friend if you had known those noble
hearts if you had known the projects of splendid charity formed by
that young lady whose heart was so generous whose mind so elevated
whose soul so great On the eve of her death as a kind of prelude to
her magnificent designs after a conversation the subject of which I
must keep secret even from you she put into my hands a considerable
sum saying with her usual grace and goodness I have been threatened
with ruin and it might perhaps come What I now confide to you will at
least be safesafefor those who suffer Give muchgive freelymake
as many happy hearts as you can My happiness shall have a royal
inauguration I do not know whether I ever told you my friend
that after those fatal events seeing Dagobert and his wife reduced to
misery poor Mother Bunch hardly able to earn a wretched subsistence
Agricola soon to become a father and myself deprived of my curacy and
suspended by my bishop for having given religious consolations to
a Protestant and offered up prayers at the tomb of an unfortunate
suicideI considered myself justified in employing a small portion of
the sum intrusted to me by Mdlle de Cardoville in the purchase of this
farm in Dagoberts name

Yes my friend such is the origin of my fortune The farmer to
whom these few acres formerly belonged gave us the rudiments of our
agricultural education and common sense and the study of a few good
practical books completed it From an excellent workman Agricola has
become an equally excellent husbandman I have tried to imitate him and
have put my hand also to the plough there is no derogation in it for
the labor which provides food for man is thrice hallowed and it is
truly to serve and glorify God to cultivate and enrich the earth He has
created Dagobert when his first grief was a little appeased seemed to
gather new vigor from this healthy life of the fields and during his
exile in Siberia he had already learned to till the ground Finally my
dear adopted mother and sister and Agricolas good wife have divided
between them the household cares and God has blessed this little colony
of people who alas have been sorely tried by misfortune and who now
only ask of toil and solitude a quite laborious innocent life and
oblivion of great sorrows Sometimes in our winter evenings you have
been able to appreciate the delicate and charming mind of the gentle
Mother Bunch the rare poetical imagination of Agricola the
tenderness of his mother the good sense of his father the exquisite
natural grace of Angela Tell me my friend was it possible to unite
more elements of domestic happiness What long evenings have we passed
round the fire of crackling wood reading or commenting on a few
immortal works which always warm the heart and enlarge the soul
What sweet talk have we had prolonged far into the night And then
Agricolas pastorals and the timid literary confidences of Magdalen
And the fresh clear voice of Angela joined to the deep manly tones of
Agricola in songs of simple melody And the old stories of Dagobert
so energetic and picturesque in their warlike spirit And the adorable
gayety of the children in their sports with good old Spoilsport
who rather lends himself to their play than takes part in itfor the
faithful intelligent creature seems always to be looking for somebody
as Dagobert saysand he is right Yes the dog also regrets those two
angels of whom he was the devoted guardian

Do not think my friend that our happiness makes us forgetful No no
not a day passes without our repeating with pious and tender respect
those names so dear to our heart And these painful memories hovering
forever about us give to our calm and happy existence that shade of
mild seriousness which struck you so much No doubt my friend this
kind of life bounded by the family circle and not extending beyond
for the happiness or improvement of our brethren may be set down as
selfish but alas we have not the meansand though the poor man
always finds a place at our frugal table and shelter beneath our roof
we must renounce all great projects of fraternal action The little
revenue of our farm just suffices to supply our wants Alas when I
think over it notwithstanding a momentary regret I cannot blame my
resolution to keep faithfully my sacred oath and to renounce that great
inheritance which alas had become immense by the death of my kindred
Yes I believe I performed a duty when I begged the guardian of that
treasure to reduce it to ashes rather than let it fall into the hands
of people who would have made an execrable use of it or to perjure
myself by disputing a donation which I had granted freely voluntarily
sincerely And yet when I picture to myself the realization of the
magnificent views ofmy ancestoran admirable Utopia only possible
with immense resourcesand which Mdlle de Cardoville hoped to carry
into execution with the aid of M Francois Hardy of Prince Djalma
of Marshal Simon and his daughters and of myselfwhen I think of the
dazzling focus of living forces which such an association would have
been and of the immense influence it might have had on the happiness of
the whole human racemy indignation and horror as an honest man and
a Christian are excited against that abominable Company whose black
plots nipped in their bud all those great hopes which promised so much
for futurity What remains now of all these splendid projects Seven
tombs For my grave also is dug in that mausoleum which Samuel has
erected on the site of the house in the Rue NeuveSaintFrancois and of
which he remains the keeperfaithful to the end

I had written thus far my friend when I received your letter So
after having forbidden you to see me your bishop now orders that you
shall cease to correspond with me Your touching painful regrets
have deeply moved me my friend Often have we talked together of
ecclesiastical discipline and of the absolute power of the bishops
over us the poor working clergy left to their mercy without remedy
It is painful but it is the law of the church my friend and you have
sworn to observe it Submit as I have submitted Every engagement is
binding upon the man of honor My poor dear Joseph would that you had
the compensations which remained to me after the rupture of ties that I
so much value But I know too well what you must feelI cannot go on
I find it impossible to continue this letter I might be bitter against
those whose orders we are bound to respect Since it must be so this
letter shall be my last Farewell my friend farewell forever My heart
is almost broken

GABRIEL DE RENNEPONT




CHAPTER II THE REDEMPTION

Day was about to dawn A rosy light almost imperceptible began to
glimmer in the east but the stars still shone sparkling with radiance
upon the azure of the zenith The birds awoke beneath the fresh foliage
of the great woods and with isolated warblings sang the prelude of
their morningconcert A light mist rose from the high grass bathed in
nocturnal dew while the calm and limpid waters of a vast lake reflected
the whitening dawn in their deep blue mirror Everything promised one
of those warm and joyous days that belong to the opening of summer

Halfway up the slope of a hill facing the east a tuft of old moss
grown willows whose rugged bark disappeared beneath the climbing
branches of wild honeysuckle and harebells formed a natural harbor
and on their gnarled and enormous roots covered with thick moss were
seated a man and a woman whose white hair deep wrinkles and bending
figures announced extreme old age And yet this woman had only lately
been young and beautiful with long black hair overshadowing her pale
forehead And yet this man had a short time ago been still in the
vigor of his age From the spot where this man and woman were reposing
could be seen the valley the lake the woods and soaring above the
woods the blue summit of a high mountain from behind which the sun was
about to rise This picture half veiled by the pale transparency of the
morning twilight was pleasing melancholy and solemn

Oh my sister said the old man to the woman who was reposing with
him beneath the rustic arbor formed by the tuft of willowtrees oh
my sister how many times during the centuries in which the hand of the
Lord carried us onward and separated from each other we traversed the
world from pole to polehow many times we have witnessed this awakening
of nature with a sentiment of incurable griefAlas it was but another
day of wanderinganother useless day added to our life since it
brought death no nearer

But now what happiness oh my brother since the Lord has had mercy on
us and with us as with all other creatures every returning day is a
step nearer to the grave Glory to Him yes glory

Glory to Him my sister for since yesterday when we again met I feel
that indescribable languor which announces the approach of death

Like you my brother I feel my strength already shaken passing away
in a sweet exhaustion Doubtless the term of our life approaches The
wrath of the Lord is satisfied

Alas my sister doubtless also the last of my doomed race will at
the same time complete our redemption by his death for the will of
heaven is manifest that I can only be pardoned when the last of
my family shall have disappeared from the face of the earth To him
holiest amongst the holiestwas reserved the favor of accomplishing
this end he who has done so much for the salvation of his brethren

Oh yes my brother he who has suffered so much and without
complaining drunk to the dregs the bitter cup of woehe the minister
of the Lord who has been his Masters image upon earthhe was fitted
for the last instrument of this redemption

Yes for I feel my sister that at this hour the last of my race
touching victim of slow persecution is on the point of resigning his
angelic soul to God Thus even to the end have I been fatal to
my doomed family Lord if Thy mercy is great Thy anger is great
likewise

Courage and hope my brother Think how after the expiration cometh
pardon and pardon is followed by a blessing The Lord punished in
you and your posterity the artisan rendered wicked by misfortune and
injustice He said to you Go on without truce or restand your labor
shall be vainand every evening throwing yourself on the hard ground
you shall be no nearer to the end of your eternal courseAnd so for
centuries men without pity have said to the artisan Work work work
without truce or restand your labor shall be fruitful for all others
but fruitless for yourselfand every evening throwing yourself on the
hard ground you shall be no nearer to happiness and repose and your
wages shall only suffice to keep you alive in pain privation and
poverty

Alas alas will it be always thus

No no my brother and instead of weeping over your lost race rejoice
for themsince their death was needed for your redemption and in
redeeming you heaven will redeem the artisan cursed and feared by
thosewho have laid on him the iron yoke Yes my brother the time
draweth nighheavens mercy will not stop with us alone Yes I tell
you in us will be rescued both the WOMAN and the SLAVE of these
modern ages The trial has been hard brother it has lasted throughout
eighteen centuries but it will last no longer Look my brother
see that rosy light there in the east gradually spreading over the
firmament Thus will rise the sun of the new emancipationpeaceful
holy great salutary fruitful filling the world with light and
vivifying heat like the daystar that will soon appear in heaven

Yes yes my sister I feel it Your words are prophetic We
shall close our heavy eyes just as we see the aurora of the day of
deliverancea fair a splendid day like that which is about to dawn
Henceforth I will only shed tears of pride and glory for those of my
race who have died the martyrs of humanity sacrificed by humanitys
eternal enemiesfor the true ancestors of the sacrilegious wretches
who blaspheme the name of Jesus by giving it to their Company were the
false Scribes and Pharisees whom the Saviour cursedYes glory to the
descendants of my family who have been the last martyrs offered up by
the accomplices of all slavery and all despotism the pitiless enemies
of those who wish to think and not to suffer in silenceof those that
would feign enjoy as children of heaven the gifts which the Creator
has bestowed upon all the human family Yes the day approachesthe end
of the reign of our modern Phariseesthe false priests who lend their
sacrilegious aid to the merciless selfishness of the strong against the
weak by daring to maintain in the face of the exhaustless treasures
of the creation that God has made man for tears and sorrow and
sufferingthe false priests who are the agents of all oppression and
would bow to the earth in brutish and hopeless humiliation the brow of
every creature No no let man lift his head proudly God made him to
be noble and intelligent free and happy

Oh my brother your words also are prophetic Yes yes the dawn of
that bright day approaches even as the dawn of the natural day which
by the mercy of God will be our last on earth

The last my sister for a strange weakness creeps over me all matter
seems dissolving in me and my soul aspires to mount to heaven

Mine eyes are growing dim brother I can scarcely see that light in
the east which lately appeared so red

Sister it is through a confused vapor that I now see the valleythe
lakethe woods My strength fails me

Blessed be God brother the moment of eternal rest is at hand

Yes it comes my sister the sweetness of the everlasting sleep takes
possession of my senses

Oh happiness I am dying

These eyes are closing sister

We are then forgiven

Forgiven

Oh my brother may this Divine redemption extend to all those who
suffer upon the earth

Die in peace my sister The great day has dawnedthe sun is
risingbehold

Blessed be God

Blessed be God

And at the moment when those two voices ceased forever the sun rose
radiant and dazzling and deluged the valley with its beams

To M CP

To you my friend I dedicated this book To inscribe it with your name
was to assume an engagement that in the absence of talent it should
be at least conscientious sincere and of a salutary influence however
limited My object is attained Some select hearts like yours my
friend have put into practice the legitimate association of labor
capital and intelligence and have already granted to their workmen a
proportionate share in the profits of their industry Others have
laid the foundations of Common Dwellinghouses and one of the chief
capitalists of Hamburg has favored me with his views respecting an
establishment of this kind on the most gigantic scale

As for the dispersion of the members of the Company of Jesus I have
taken less part in it than other enemies of the detestable doctrines of
Loyola whose influence and authority were far greater than mine

Adieu my friend I could have wished this work more worthy of you but
you are indulgent and will at least give me credit for the intentions
which dictated it

Believe me Yours truly
