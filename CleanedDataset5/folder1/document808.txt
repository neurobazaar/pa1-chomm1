ACT I


 Scene the Piazzetta Venice The Ducal Palace on the right

 Fiametta Giulia Vittoria and other Contadine discovered each
 tying a bouquet of roses

 CHORUS OF CONTADINE

 List and learn ye dainty roses
 Roses white and roses red
 Why we bind you into posies
 Ere your morning bloom has fled
 By a law of maidens making
 Accents of a heart thats aching
 Even though that heart be breaking
 Should by maiden be unsaid
 Though they love with love exceeding
 They must seem to be unheeding
 Go ye then and do their pleading
 Roses white and roses red

 FIAMETTA

 Two there are for whom in duty
 Every maid in Venice sighs
 Two so peerless in their beauty
 That they shame the summer skies
 We have hearts for them in plenty
 They have hearts but all too few
 We alas are fourandtwenty
 They alas are only two
 We alas

 CHORUS Alas

 FIA Are fourandtwenty
 They alas

 CHORUS Alas

 FIA Are only two

 CHORUS They alas are only two alas
 Now ye know ye dainty roses
 Roses white and roses red
 Why we bind you into posies
 Ere your morning bloom has fled
 Roses white and roses red

 Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girlsat first two

 FIA and VIT Till then enjoy your dolce far niente

 ANT With pleasure nobody contradicente

 For the merriest fellows are we tra la

 choice

 DUETMARCO and GIUSEPPE

 Were called gondolieri
 But thats a vagary
 Its quite honorary
 The trade that we ply
 For gallantry noted
 Since we were shortcoated
 To beauty devoted
 GiuseppeAre Marco and I

 When morning is breaking
 Our couches forsaking
 To greet their awaking
 With carols we come
 At summer days nooning
 When weary lagooning
 Our mandolins tuning
 We lazily thrum

 When vespers are ringing
 To hope ever clinging
 With songs of our singing
 A vigil we keep
 When daylight is fading
 Enwrapt in nights shading
 With soft serenading
 We sing them to sleep

 Were called gondolieri etc

 RECITATIVEMARCO and GIUSEPPE

 MAR And now to choose our brides

 GIU As all are young and fair

 ALL Viva

 GIRLS A bias to disclose

 MEN But how do they propose
 To let impartial Fate
 Select for them a mate

 GIU These handkerchiefs upon our eyes be good enough to

 They all dance off two and twoGianetta with Marco Tessa with
 Giuseppe

 Flourish A gondola arrives at the Piazzetta steps from which
 enter the Duke of Plazatoro the Duchess their daughter
 Casilda and their attendant Luiz who carries a drum All are
 dressed in pompous but old and faded clothes

 Entrance of Duke Duchess Casilda and Luiz

 DUKE From the sunny Spanish shore
 The Duke of PlazaTor

 DUCH And His Graces Duchess true

 CAS And His Graces daughter too

 LUIZ And His Graces private drum
 To Venetias shores have come

 ALL If ever ever ever
 They get back to Spain
 They will never never never
 Cross the sea again

 DUKE Neither that Grandee from the Spanish shore
 The noble Duke of PlazaTor

 DUCH Nor His Graces Duchess staunch and true

 CAS You may add His Graces daughter too

 LUIZ Nor His Graces own particular drum
 To Venetias shores will come

 ALL If ever ever ever
 They get back to Spain
 They will never never never
 Cross the sea again

 DUKE At last we have arrived at our destination This is
 the Ducal Palace and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor
 resides As a Castilian hidalgo of ninetyfive quarterings I
 regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse As a
 Castilian hidalgo of that description I should have preferred to
 ride through the streets of Venice but owing I presume to an
 unusually wet season the streets are in such a condition that
 equestrian exercise is impracticable No matter Where is our
 suite
 LUIZ coming forward Your Grace I am here
 DUCH Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when
 you address His Grace
 DUKE My love it is so small a matter To Luiz Still
 you may as well do it Luiz kneels
 CAS The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect
 appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian
 hidalgo
 DUKE My child you are hard upon our suite
 CAS Papa Ive no patience with the presumption of persons
 in his plebeian position If he does not appreciate that
 position let him be whipped until he does
 DUKE Let us hope the omission was not intended as a
 slight I should be much hurt if I thought it was So would he
 To Luiz Where are the halberdiers who were to have had the
 honour of meeting us here that our visit to the Grand Inquisitor
 might be made in becoming state
 LUIZ Your Grace the halberdiers are mercenary people who
 stipulated for a trifle on account
 DUKE How tiresome Well let us hope the Grand Inquisitor
 is a blind gentleman And the band who were to have had the
 honour of escorting us I see no band
 LUIZ Your Grace the band are sordid persons who required
 to be paid in advance
 DUCH Thats so like a band
 DUKE annoyed Insuperable difficulties meet me at every
 turn
 DUCH But surely they know His Grace
 LUIZ Exactlythey know His Grace
 DUKE Well let us hope that the Grand Inquisitor is a deaf
 gentleman A cornetapiston would be something You do not
 happen to possess the accomplishment of tootling like a
 cornetapiston
 LUIZ Alas no Your Grace But I can imitate a farmyard
 DUKE doubtfully I dont see how that would help us I
 dont see how we could bring it in
 CAS It would not help us in the least We are not a
 parcel of graziers come to market dolt
 Luiz
 rises
 DUKE My love our suites feelings To Luiz Be so
 good as to ring the bell and inform the Grand Inquisitor that his
 Grace the Duke of PlazaToro Count Matadoro Baron Picadoro
 DUCH And suite
 DUKE And suitehave arrived at Venice and seek
 CAS Desire
 DUCH Demand
 DUKE And demand an audience
 LUIZ Your Grace has but to command
 DUKE much moved I felt sure of itI felt sure of it
 Exit Luiz into Ducal Palace And now my loveaside to
 Duchess Shall we tell her I think soaloud to Casilda And
 now my love prepare for a magnificent surprise It is my
 agreeable duty to reveal to you a secret which should make you
 the happiest young lady in Venice
 CAS A secret
 DUCH A secret which for State reasons it has been
 necessary to preserve for twenty years
 DUKE When you were a prattling babe of six months old you
 were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son
 and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of
 Barataria
 CAS Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria
 Was I consulted Duke shakes his head Then it was a most
 unpardonable liberty
 DUKE Consider his extreme youth and forgive him Shortly
 after the ceremony that misguided monarch abandoned the creed of
 his forefathers and became a Wesleyan Methodist of the most
 bigoted and persecuting type The Grand Inquisitor determined
 that the innovation should not be perpetuated in Barataria
 caused your smiling and unconscious husband to be stolen and
 conveyed to Venice A fortnight since the Methodist Monarch and
 all his Wesleyan Court were killed in an insurrection and we are
 here to ascertain the whereabouts of your husband and to hail
 you our daughter as Her Majesty the reigning Queen of
 Barataria Kneels

 During this speech Luiz reenters

 DUCH Your Majesty Kneels Drum roll
 DUKE It is at such moments as these that one feels how
 necessary it is to travel with a full band
 CAS I the Queen of Barataria But Ive nothing to wear
 We are practically penniless
 DUKE That point has not escaped me Although I am
 unhappily in straitened circumstances at present my social
 influence is something enormous and a Company to be called the
 Duke of PlazaToro Limited is in course of formation to work
 me An influential directorate has been secured and I shall
 myself join the Board after allotment
 CAS Am I to understand that the Queen of Barataria may be
 called upon at any time to witness her honoured sire in process
 of liquidation
 DUCH The speculation is not exempt from that drawback If
 your father should stop it will of course be necessary to wind
 him up
 CAS But its so undignifiedits so degrading A Grandee
 of Spain turned into a public company Such a thing was never
 heard of
 DUKE My child the Duke of PlazaToro does not follow
 fashionshe leads them He always leads everybody When he was
 in the army he led his regiment He occasionally led them into
 action He invariably led them out of it

 SONGDUKE OF PLAZATORO

 In enterprise of martial kind
 When there was any fighting
 He led his regiment from behind
 He found it less exciting
 But when away his regiment ran
 His place was at the fore O
 That celebrated
 Cultivated
 Underrated
 Nobleman
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 ALL In the first and foremost flight ha ha
 You always found that knight ha ha
 That celebrated
 Cultivated
 Underrated
 Nobleman
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 DUKE When to evade Destructions hand
 To hide they all proceeded
 No soldier in that gallant band
 Hid half as well as he did
 He lay concealed throughout the war
 And so preserved his gore O
 That unaffected
 Undetected
 Wellconnected
 Warrior
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 ALL In every doughty deed ha ha
 He always took the lead ha ha
 That unaffected
 Undetected
 Wellconnected
 Warrior
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 DUKE When told that they would all be shot
 Unless they left the service
 That hero hesitated not
 So marvellous his nerve is
 He sent his resignation in
 The first of all his corps O
 That very knowing
 Overflowing
 Easygoing
 Paladin
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 ALL To men of grosser clay ha ha
 He always showed the way ha ha
 That very knowing
 Overflowing
 Easygoing
 Paladin
 The Duke of PlazaToro

 Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace As soon as
 they have disappeared Luiz and Casilda rush to each others
 arms

 RECITATIVE AND DUETCASILDA AND LUIZ

 O rapture when alone together
 Two loving hearts and those that bear them
 May join in temporary tether
 Though Fate apart should rudely tear them

 CAS Necessity Inventions mother
 Compelled me to a course of feigning
 But left alone with one another
 I will atone for my disdaining

 AIR

 CAS Ah wellbeloved
 Mine angry frown
 Is but a gown
 That serves to dress
 My gentleness

 LUIZ Ah wellbeloved
 Thy cold disdain
 It gives no pain
 Tis mercy played
 In masquerade

 BOTH Ah wellbeloved etc

 CAS O Luiz Luizwhat have you said What have I done
 What have I allowed you to do
 LUIZ Nothing I trust that you will ever have reason to
 repent Offering to embrace her
 CAS withdrawing from him Nay Luiz it may not be I
 have embraced you for the last time
 LUIZ amazed Casilda
 CAS I have just learnt to my surprise and indignation
 that I was wed in babyhood to the infant son of the King of
 Barataria
 LUIZ The son of the King of Barataria The child who was
 stolen in infancy by the Inquisition
 CAS The same But of course you know his story
 LUIZ Know his story Why I have often told you that my
 mother was the nurse to whose charge he was entrusted
 CAS True I had forgotten Well he has been discovered
 and my father has brought me here to claim his hand
 LUIZ But you will not recognize this marriage It took
 place when you were too young to understand its import
 CAS Nay Luiz respect my principles and cease to torture
 me with vain entreaties Henceforth my life is anothers
 LUIZ But staythe present and the futurethey are
 anothers but the pastthat at least is ours and none can take
 it from us As we may revel in naught else let us revel in
 that
 CAS I dont think I grasp your meaning
 LUIZ Yet it is logical enough You say you cease to love
 me
 CAS demurely I say I may not love you
 LUIZ Ah but you do not say you did not love me
 CAS I loved you with a frenzy that words are powerless to
 expressand that but ten brief minutes since
 LUIZ Exactly My ownthat is until ten minutes since
 my ownmy lately loved my recently adoredtell me that until
 say a quarter of an hour ago I was all in all to thee
 Embracing her
 CAS I see your idea Its ingenious but dont do that
 Releasing herself
 LUIZ There can be no harm in revelling in the past
 CAS None whatever but an embrace cannot be taken to act
 retrospectively
 LUIZ Perhaps not
 CAS We may recollect an embraceI recollect manybut we
 must not repeat them
 LUIZ Then let us recollect a few A moments pause as
 they recollect then both heave a deep sigh
 LUIZ Ah Casilda you were to me as the sun is to the
 earth
 CAS A quarter of an hour ago
 LUIZ About that
 CAS And to think that but for this miserable discovery
 you would have been my own for life
 LUIZ Through life to deatha quarter of an hour ago
 CAS How greedily my thirsty ears would have drunk the
 golden melody of those sweet words a quarterwell its now
 about twenty minutes since Looking at her watch
 LUIZ About that In such a matter one cannot be too
 precise
 CAS And now our love so full of life is but a silent
 solemn memory
 LUIZ Must it be so Casilda
 CAS Luiz it must be so

 DUETCASILDA and LUIZ

 LUIZ There was a time
 A time for ever goneah woe is me
 It was no crime
 To love but thee aloneah woe is me
 One heart one life one soul
 One aim one goal
 Each in the others thrall
 Each all in all ah woe is me

 BOTH Oh bury burylet the grave close oer
 The days that werethat never will be more
 Oh bury bury love that all condemn
 And let the whirlwind mourn its requiem

 CAS Dead as the last years leaves
 As gathered flowersah woe is me
 Dead as the garnered sheaves
 That love of oursah woe is me
 Born but to fade and die
 When hope was high
 Dead and as far away
 As yesterdayah woe is me

 BOTH Oh bury burylet the grave close oer etc

 Reenter from the Ducal Palace the Duke and Duchess followed by
 Don Alhambra del Bolero the Grand Inquisitor

 DUKE My child allow me to present to you His Distinction
 Don Alhambra del Bolero the Grand Inquisitor of Spain It was
 His Distinction who so thoughtfully abstracted your infant
 husband and brought him to Venice
 DON AL So this is the little lady who is so unexpectedly
 called upon to assume the functions of Royalty And a very nice
 little lady too
 DUKE Jimp isnt she
 DON AL Distinctly jimp Allow me Offers his hand She
 turns away scornfully Naughty temper
 DUKE You must make some allowance Her Majestys head is
 a little turned by her access of dignity
 DON AL I could have wished that Her Majestys access of
 dignity had turned it in this direction
 DUCH Unfortunately if I am not mistaken there appears to
 be some little doubt as to His Majestys whereabouts
 CAS aside A doubt as to his whereabouts Then we may
 yet be saved
 DON AL A doubt Oh dear nono doubt at all He is
 here in Venice plying the modest but picturesque calling of a
 gondolier I can give you his addressI see him every day In
 the entire annals of our history there is absolutely no
 circumstance so entirely free from all manner of doubt of any
 kind whatever Listen and Ill tell you all about it

 SONGDON ALHAMBRA
 with DUKE DUCHESS CASILDA and LUIZ

 I stole the Prince and I brought him here
 And left him gaily prattling
 With a highly respectable gondolier
 Who promised the Royal babe to rear
 And teach him the trade of a timoneer
 With his own beloved bratling

 Both of the babes were strong and stout
 And considering all things clever
 Of that there is no manner of doubt
 No probable possible shadow of doubt
 No possible doubt whatever

 ALL No possible doubt whatever

 But owing Im much disposed to fear
 To his terrible taste for tippling
 That highly respectable gondolier
 Could never declare with a mind sincere
 Which of the two was his offspring dear
 And which the Royal stripling

 Which was which he could never make out
 Despite his best endeavour
 Of that there is no manner of doubt
 No probable possible shadow of doubt
 No possible doubt whatever

 ALL No possible doubt whatever

 Time sped and when at the end of a year
 I sought that infant cherished
 That highly respectable gondolier
 Was lying a corpse on his humble bier
 I dropped a Grand Inquisitors tear
 That gondolier had perished

 A taste for drink combined with gout
 Had doubled him up for ever
 Of that there is no manner of doubt
 No probable possible shadow of doubt
 No possible doubt whatever

 ALL No possible doubt whatever

 The children followed his old career
 This statement cant be parried
 Of a highly respectable gondolier
 Well one of the two who will soon be here
 But which of the two is not quite clear
 Is the Royal Prince you married

 Search in and out and round about
 And youll discover never
 A tale so free from every doubt
 All probable possible shadow of doubt
 All possible doubt whatever

 ALL A tale free from every doubt etc

 CAS Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of
 two gondoliers but it is impossible to say which
 DON AL Without any doubt of any kind whatever But be
 reassured the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the
 mother of the musical young man who is such a pastmaster of that
 delicately modulated instrument indicating the drum She can
 no doubt establish the Kings identity beyond all question
 LUIZ Heavens how did he know that
 DON AL My young friend a Grand Inquisitor is always up to
 date To Cas His mother is at present the wife of a highly
 respectable and oldestablished brigand who carries on an
 extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova Accompanied
 by two of my emissaries he will set off at once for his mothers
 address She will return with them and if she finds any
 difficulty in making up her mind the persuasive influence of the
 torture chamber will jog her memory

 RECITATIVECASILDA and DON ALHAMBRA

 CAS But bless my heart consider my position
 I am the wife of one thats very clear
 But who can tell except by intuition
 Which is the Prince and which the Gondolier

 DON AL Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle
 Such complications frequently occur
 Life is one closely complicated tangle
 Death is the only true unraveller

 QUINTETDUKE DUCHESS CASILDA LUIZ and GRAND INQUISITOR

 ALL Try we lifelong we can never
 Straighten out lifes tangled skein
 Why should we in vain endeavour
 Guess and guess and guess again

 LUIZ Lifes a pudding full of plums

 DUCH Cares a canker that benumbs

 ALL Lifes a pudding full of plums
 Cares a canker that benumbs
 Wherefore waste our elocution
 On impossible solution
 Lifes a pleasant institution
 Let us take it as it comes

 Set aside the dull enigma
 We shall guess it all too soon
 Failure brings no kind of stigma
 Dance we to another tune

 LUIZ String the lyre and fill the cup

 DUCH Lest on sorrow we should sup

 ALL Hop and skip to Fancys fiddle
 Hands across and down the middle
 Lifes perhaps the only riddle
 That we shrink from giving up

 Exeunt all into Ducal Palace except Luiz who goes off in
 gondola

 Enter Gondoliers and Contadine followed by Marco Gianetta
 Giuseppe and Tessa

 CHORUS

 Bridegroom and bride
 Knot thats insoluble
 Voices all voluble
 Hail it with pride
 Bridegroom and bride
 We in sincerity
 Wish you prosperity
 Bridegroom and bride

 SONGTESSA

 TESS When a merry maiden marries
 Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries
 Every sound becomes a song
 All is right and nothings wrong
 From today and ever after
 Let our tears be tears of laughter
 Every sigh that finds a vent
 Be a sigh of sweet content
 When you marry merry maiden
 Then the air with love is laden
 Every flower is a rose
 Every goose becomes a swan
 Every kind of trouble goes
 Where the last years snows have gone

 CHORUS Sunlight takes the place of shade
 When you marry merry maid

 TESS When a merry maiden marries
 Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries
 Every sound becomes a song
 All is right and nothings wrong
 Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow
 Get ye gone until tomorrow
 Jealousies in grim array
 Ye are things of yesterday
 When you marry merry maiden
 Then the air with joy is laden
 All the corners of the earth
 Ring with music sweetly played
 Worry is melodious mirth
 Grief is joy in masquerade

 CHORUS Sullen night is laughing day
 All the year is merry May

 At the end of the song Don Alhambra enters at back The
 Gondoliers and Contadine shrink from him and gradually go off
 much alarmed

 GIU And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest
 Whats a bachelor A mere nothinghes a chrysalis He cant
 be said to livehe exists
 MAR What a delightful institution marriage is Why have
 we wasted all this time Why didnt we marry ten years ago
 TESS Because you couldnt find anybody nice enough
 GIA Because you were waiting for us
 MAR I suppose that was the reason We were waiting for
 you without knowing it Don Alhambra comes forward Hallo
 DON AL Good morning
 GIU If this gentleman is an undertaker its a bad omen
 DON AL Ceremony of some sort going on
 GIU aside He is an undertaker Aloud Noa little
 unimportant family gathering Nothing in your line
 DON AL Somebodys birthday I suppose
 GIA Yes mine
 TESS And mine
 MAR And mine
 GIU And mine
 DON AL Curious coincidence And how old may you all be
 TESS Its a rude questionbut about ten minutes
 DON AL Remarkably fine children But surely you are
 jesting
 TESS In other words we were married about ten minutes
 since
 DON AL Married You dont mean to say you are married
 MAR Oh yes we are married
 DON AL What both of you
 ALL All four of us
 DON AL aside Bless my heart how extremely awkward
 GIA You dont mind I suppose
 TESS You were not thinking of either of us for yourself I
 presume Oh Giuseppe look at himhe was Hes heartbroken
 DON AL No no I wasnt I wasnt
 GIU Now my man slapping him on the back we dont want
 anything in your line today and if your curiositys
 satisfiedyou can go
 DON AL You mustnt call me your man Its a liberty I
 dont think you know who I am
 GIU Not we indeed We are jolly gondoliers the sons of
 Baptisto Palmieri who led the last revolution Republicans
 heart and soul we hold all men to be equal As we abhor
 oppression we abhor kings as we detest vainglory we detest
 rank as we despise effeminacy we despise wealth We are
 Venetian gondoliersyour equals in everything except our
 calling and in that at once your masters and your servants
 DON AL Bless my heart how unfortunate One of you may be
 Baptistos son for anything I know to the contrary but the
 other is no less a personage than the only son of the late King
 of Barataria
 ALL What
 DON AL And I trustI trust it was that one who slapped me
 on the shoulder and called me his man
 GIU One of us a king
 MAR Not brothers
 TESS The King of Barataria Together
 GIA Well whod have thought it
 MAR But which is it
 DON AL What does it matter As you are both Republicans
 and hold kings in detestation of course youll abdicate at once
 Good morning Going
 GIA and TESS Oh dont do that Marco and Giuseppe stop
 him
 GIU Well as to that of course there are kings and kings
 When I say that I detest kings I mean I detest bad kings
 DON AL I see Its a delicate distinction
 GIU Quite so Now I can conceive a kind of kingan ideal
 kingthe creature of my fancy you knowwho would be absolutely
 unobjectionable A king for instance who would abolish taxes
 and make everything cheap except gondolas
 MAR And give a great many free entertainments to the
 gondoliers
 GIU And let off fireworks on the Grand Canal and engage
 all the gondolas for the occasion
 MAR And scramble money on the Rialto among the gondoliers
 GIU Such a king would be a blessing to his people and if
 I were a king that is the sort of king I would be
 MAR And so would I
 DON AL Come Im glad to find your objections are not
 insuperable
 MAR and GIU Oh theyre not insuperable
 GIA and TESS No theyre not insuperable
 GIU Besides we are open to conviction
 GIA Yes they are open to conviction
 TESS Oh theyve often been convicted
 GIU Our views may have been hastily formed on insufficient
 grounds They may be crude illdigested erroneous Ive a
 very poor opinion of the politician who is not open to
 conviction
 TESS to Gia Oh hes a fine fellow
 GIA Yes thats the sort of politician for my money
 DON AL Then well consider it settled Now as the
 country is in a state of insurrection it is absolutely necessary
 that you should assume the reins of Government at once and
 until it is ascertained which of you is to be king I have
 arranged that you will reign jointly so that no question can
 arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts
 MAR As one individual
 DON AL As one individual
 GIU linking himself with Marco Like this
 DON AL Something like that
 MAR And we may take our friends with us and give them
 places about the Court
 DON AL Undoubtedly Thats always done
 MAR Im convinced

 FINALE ACT I

 SONGGIANETTA

 Kind sir you cannot have the heart
 Our lives to part
 From those to whom an hour ago
 We were united
 Before our flowing hopes you stem
 Ah look at them
 And pause before you deal this blow
 All uninvited
 You men can never understand
 That heart and hand
 Cannot be separated when
 We go ayearning
 You see youve only womens eyes
 To idolize
 And only womens hearts poor men
 To set you burning
 Ah me you men will never understand
 That womans heart is one with womans hand

 Some kind of charm you seem to find
 In womankind
 Some source of unexplained delight
 Unless youre jesting
 But what attracts you I confess
 I cannot guess
 To me a womans face is quite
 Uninteresting
 If from my sister I were torn
 It could be borne
 I should no doubt be horrified
 But I could bear it
 But Marcos quite another thing
 He is my King
 He has my heart and none beside
 Shall ever share it
 Ah me you men will never understand
 That womans heart is one with womans hand

 RECITATIVEDON ALHAMBRA

 Do not give way to this uncalledfor grief
 Your separation will be very brief
 To ascertain which is the King
 And which the other
 To Baratarias Court Ill bring
 His fostermother
 Her former nurseling to declare
 Shell be delighted
 That settled let each happy pair
 Be reunited

 MAR GIU Viva His argument is strong
 GIA TESS Viva Well not be parted long
 Viva It will be settled soon
 Viva Then comes our honeymoon

 MAR Shell drive about in a carriage and pair
 With the King on her lefthand side

 And as much as she wants to eat

 ALL Oh tis a glorious thing I ween etc

 TESS Whenever she condescends to walk
 Be sure shell shine at that
 With her haughty stare

 And I trust I see you well

 ALL Oh tis a glorious thing I ween etc

 GIU And noble lords will scrape and bow
 And double themselves in two
 And open their eyes
 In blank surprise
 At whatever she likes to do
 And everybody will roundly vow
 Shes fair as flowers in May

 ALL Oh tis a glorious thing I ween
 To be a regular Royal Queen
 No halfandhalf affair I mean
 But a rightdown regular Royal Queen

 But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart

 Addressing Gianetta and
 Tessa

 GIANETTA and TESSA together

 Farewell my love on board you must be getting
 But while upon the sea you gaily roam
 Remember that a heart for thee is fretting
 The tender little heart youve left at home

 GIA Now Marco dear
 My wishes hear
 While youre away
 Its understood
 You will be good
 And not too gay
 To every trace
 Of maiden grace
 You will be blind
 And will not glance
 By any chance
 On womankind

 If you are wise
 Youll shut your eyes
 Till we arrive
 And not address
 A lady less
 Than fortyfive
 Youll please to frown
 On every gown
 That you may see
 And O my pet
 You wont forget
 Youve married me

 And O my darling O my pet
 Whatever else you may forget
 In yonder isle beyond the sea
 Do not forget youve married me

 TESS Youll lay your head
 Upon your bed
 At set of sun
 You will not sing
 Of anything
 To any one
 Youll sit and mope
 All day I hope
 And shed a tear
 Upon the life
 Your little wife
 Is passing here

 And if so be
 You think of me
 Please tell the moon
 Ill read it all
 In rays that fall
 On the lagoon
 Youll be so kind
 As tell the wind
 How you may be
 And send me words
 By little birds
 To comfort me

 And O my darling O my pet
 Whatever else you may forget
 In yonder isle beyond the sea
 Do not forget youve married me

 END OF ACT I




ACT II


 SCENEPavilion in the Court of Barataria Marco and
 Giuseppe magnificently dressed are seated on two thrones
 occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre The Gondoliers
 are discovered dressed some as courtiers officers of rank
 etc and others as private soldiers and servants of various
 degrees All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
 distinctionssome playing cards others throwing dice some
 reading others playing cup and ball morra etc

 CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE

 Of happiness the very pith
 In Barataria you may see
 A monarchy thats tempered with
 Republican Equality
 This form of government we find
 The beau ideal of its kind
 A despotism strict combined
 With absolute equality

 MARCO and GIUSEPPE

 Two kings of undue pride bereft
 Who act in perfect unity
 Whom you can order right and left
 With absolute impunity
 Who put their subjects at their ease
 By doing all they can to please
 And thus to earn their breadandcheese
 Seize every opportunity

 CHORUS Of happiness the very pith etc

 MAR Gentlemen we are much obliged to you for your
 expressions of satisfaction and good feelingI say we are much
 obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
 feeling
 ALL We heard you
 MAR We are delighted at any time to fall in with
 sentiments so charmingly expressed
 ALL Thats all right
 GIU At the same time there is just one little grievance
 that we should like to ventilate
 ALL angrily What
 GIU Dont be alarmedits not serious It is arranged
 that until it is decided which of us two is the actual King we
 are to act as one person
 GIORGIO Exactly
 GIU Now although we act as one person we are in point
 of fact two persons
 ANNIBALE Ah I dont think we can go into that It is a
 legal fiction and legal fictions are solemn things Situated as
 we are we cant recognize two independent responsibilities
 GIU No but you can recognize two independent appetites
 Its all very well to say we act as one person but when you
 supply us with only one ration between us I should describe it
 as a legal fiction carried a little too far
 ANNI Its rather a nice point I dont like to express an
 opinion offhand Suppose we reserve it for argument before the
 full Court
 MAR Yes but what are we to do in the meantime
 MAR and GIU We want our tea
 ANNI I think we may make an interim order for double
 rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to
 indemnify in the event of an adverse decision
 GIOR That I think will meet the case But you must work
 hardstick to itnothing like work
 GIU Oh certainly We quite understand that a man who
 holds the magnificent position of King should do something to
 justify it We are called Your Majesty we are allowed to buy
 ourselves magnificent clothes our subjects frequently nod to us
 in the streets the sentries always return our salutes and we
 enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists
 to all the principal charities In return for these advantages
 the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace
 SONGGIUSEPPE with CHORUS

 Rising early in the morning
 We proceed to light the fire
 Then our Majesty adorning
 In its workaday attire
 We embark without delay
 On the duties of the day

 First we polish off some batches
 Of political despatches
 And foreign politicians circumvent
 Then if business isnt heavy
 We may hold a Royal levee
 Or ratify some Acts of Parliament
 Then we probably review the household troops
 With the usual Shalloo humps and Shalloo hoops
 Or receive with ceremonial and state
 An interesting Eastern potentate
 After that we generally
 Go and dress our private valet
 Its a rather nervous dutyhes a touchy little man
 Write some letters literary
 For our private secretary
 He is shaky in his spelling so we help him if we can
 Then in view of cravings inner
 We go down and order dinner
 Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate
 Spend an hour in titivating
 All our GentlemeninWaiting
 Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State

 Oh philosophers may sing
 Of the troubles of a King
 Yet the duties are delightful and the privileges great
 But the privilege and pleasure
 That we treasure beyond measure
 Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State

 CHORUS Oh philosophers may sing etc

 After luncheon making merry
 On a bun and glass of sherry
 If weve nothing in particular to do
 We may make a Proclamation
 Or receive a deputation
 Then we possibly create a Peer or two
 Then we help a fellowcreature on his path
 With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath
 Or we dress and toddle off in semistate
 To a festival a function or a fete
 Then we go and stand as sentry
 At the Palace private entry
 Marching hither marching thither up and down and to and
 fro
 While the warrior on duty
 Goes in search of beer and beauty
 And it generally happens that he hasnt far to go
 He relieves us if hes able
 Just in time to lay the table
 Then we dine and serve the coffee and at halfpast twelve
 or one
 With a pleasure thats emphatic
 We retire to our attic
 With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done

 Oh philosophers may sing
 Of the troubles of a King
 But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are
 none
 And the culminating pleasure
 That we treasure beyond measure
 Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done

 CHORUS Oh philosophers may sing etc

 Exeunt all but Marco and
 Giuseppe

 GIU Yes it really is a very pleasant existence Theyre
 all so singularly kind and considerate You dont find them
 wanting to do this or wanting to do that or saying Its my
 turn now No they let us have all the fun to ourselves and
 never seem to grudge it
 MAR It makes one feel quite selfish It almost seems like
 taking advantage of their good nature
 GIU How nice they were about the double rations
 MAR Most considerate Ah theres only one thing wanting
 to make us thoroughly comfortable
 GIU And that is
 MAR The dear little wives we left behind us three months
 ago
 GIU Yes it is dull without female society We can do
 without everything else but we cant do without that
 MAR And if we have that in perfection we have everything
 There is only one recipe for perfect happiness

 SONGMARCO

 Take a pair of sparkling eyes
 Hidden ever and anon
 In a merciful eclipse
 Do not heed their mild surprise
 Having passed the Rubicon
 Take a pair of rosy lips
 Take a figure trimly planned
 Such as admiration whets
 Be particular in this
 Take a tender little hand
 Fringed with dainty fingerettes
 Press itin parenthesis
 Ah Take all these you lucky man
 Take and keep them if you can

 Take a pretty little cot
 Quite a miniature affair
 Hung about with trellised vine
 Furnish it upon the spot
 With the treasures rich and rare
 Ive endeavoured to define
 Live to love and love to live
 You will ripen at your ease
 Growing on the sunny side
 Fate has nothing more to give
 Youre a dainty man to please
 If you are not satisfied
 Ah Take my counsel happy man
 Act upon it if you can

 CHORUS They will both go on requesting etc

 TESS Is the populace exacting
 GIA Do they keep you at a distance

 TESS When youre busy have you got to
 Get up early in the morning

 patch their clothesat least I hope they haventlet us all
 pack up a change and go and see how theyre getting on And she

 The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don
 Alhambra who looks on with astonishment Marco and Giuseppe
 appear embarrassed The others run off except Drummer Boy who
 is driven off by Don Alhambra

 DON AL Good evening Fancy ball
 GIU No not exactly A little friendly dance Thats
 all Sorry youre late
 DON AL But I saw a groom dancing and a footman
 MAR Yes Thats the Lord High Footman
 DON AL And dear me a common little drummer boy
 GIU Oh no Thats the Lord High Drummer Boy
 DON AL But surely surely the servantshall is the place
 for these gentry
 GIU Oh dear no We have appropriated the servantshall
 Its the Royal Apartment and accessible only by tickets
 obtainable at the Lord Chamberlains office
 MAR We really must have some place that we can call our
 own
 DON AL puzzled Im afraid Im not quite equal to the
 intellectual pressure of the conversation
 GIU You see the Monarchy has been remodelled on
 Republican principles
 DON AL What
 GIU All departments rank equally and everybody is at the
 head of his department
 DON AL I see
 MAR Im afraid youre annoyed
 DON AL No I wont say that Its not quite what I
 expected
 GIU Im awfully sorry
 MAR So am I
 GIU By the by can I offer you anything after your voyage
 A plate of macaroni and a rusk
 DON AL preoccupied No nonothingnothing
 GIU Obliged to be careful
 DON AL Yesgout You see in every Court there are
 distinctions that must be observed
 GIU puzzled There are are there
 DON AL Why of course For instance you wouldnt have a
 Lord High Chancellor play leapfrog with his own cook
 MAR Why not
 DON AL Why not Because a Lord High Chancellor is a
 personage of great dignity who should never under any
 circumstances place himself in the position of being told to
 tuck in his tuppenny except by noblemen of his own rank A Lord
 High Archbishop for instance might tell a Lord High Chancellor
 to tuck in his tuppenny but certainly not a cook gentlemen
 certainly not a cook
 GIU Not even a Lord High Cook
 DON AL My good friend that is a rank that is not
 recognized at the Lord Chamberlains office No no it wont
 do Ill give you an instance in which the experiment was tried

 SONGDON ALHAMBRA with MARCO and GIUSEPPE

 DON AL There lived a King as Ive been told
 In the wonderworking days of old
 When hearts were twice as good as gold
 And twenty times as mellow
 Goodtemper triumphed in his face
 And in his heart he found a place
 For all the erring human race
 And every wretched fellow
 When he had Rhenish wine to drink
 It made him very sad to think
 That some at junket or at jink
 Must be content with toddy

 MAR and GIU With toddy must be content with toddy

 DON AL He wished all men as rich as he
 And he was rich as rich could be
 So to the top of every tree
 Promoted everybody

 MAR and GIU Now thats the kind of King for me
 He wished all men as rich as he
 So to the top of every tree
 Promoted everybody

 DON AL Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats
 And Bishops in their shovel hats
 Were plentiful as tabby cats
 In point of fact too many
 Ambassadors cropped up like hay
 Prime Ministers and such as they
 Grew like asparagus in May
 And Dukes were three a penny
 On every side FieldMarshals gleamed
 Small beer were LordsLieutenant deemed
 With Admirals the ocean teemed
 All round his wide dominions

 MAR and GIU With Admirals all round his wide dominions

 DON AL And Party Leaders you might meet
 In twos and threes in every street
 Maintaining with no little heat
 Their various opinions

 MAR and GIU Now thats a sight you couldnt beat
 Two Party Leaders in each street
 Maintaining with no little heat
 Their various opinions

 DON AL That King although no one denies
 His heart was of abnormal size
 Yet hed have acted otherwise
 If he had been acuter
 The end is easily foretold
 When every blessed thing you hold
 Is made of silver or of gold
 You long for simple pewter
 When you have nothing else to wear
 But cloth of gold and satins rare
 For cloth of gold you cease to care
 Up goes the price of shoddy

 MAR and GIU Of shoddy up goes the price of shoddy

 DON AL In short whoever you may be
 To this conclusion youll agree
 When every one is somebodee
 Then no ones anybody

 MAR and GIU Now thats as plain as plain can be
 To this conclusion we agree

 ALL When every one is somebodee
 Then no ones anybody

 Gianetta and Tessa enter unobserved The two girls impelled by
 curiosity remain listening at the back of the stage

 DON AL And now I have some important news to communicate
 His Grace the Duke of PlazaToro Her Grace the Duchess and
 their beautiful daughter CasildaI say their beautiful daughter
 Casilda
 GIU We heard you
 DON AL Have arrived at Barataria and may be here at any
 moment
 MAR The Duke and Duchess are nothing to us
 DON AL But the daughterthe beautiful daughter Aha
 Oh youre a lucky dog one of you
 GIU I think youre a very incomprehensible old gentleman
 DON AL Not a bitIll explain Many years ago when you

 married to a little girl who has grown up to be the most
 beautiful young lady in Spain That beautiful young lady will be
 here to claim you whichever you are in half an hour and I
 congratulate that one whichever it is with all my heart
 MAR Married when a baby
 GIU But we were married three months ago
 DON AL One of youonly one The other whichever it is

 GIA and TESS coming forward Well upon my word
 DON AL Eh Who are these young people
 TESS Who are we Why their wives of course Weve just
 arrived
 DON AL Their wives Oh dear this is very unfortunate
 Oh dear this complicates matters Dear dear what will Her
 Majesty say
 GIA And do you mean to say that one of these Monarchs was
 already married
 TESS And that neither of us will be a Queen
 DON AL That is the idea I intended to convey Tessa and
 Gianetta begin to cry
 GIU to Tessa Tessa my dear dear child
 TESS Get away perhaps its you
 MAR to Gia My poor poor little woman
 GIA Dont Who knows whose husband you are
 TESS And pray why didnt you tell us all about it before
 they left Venice
 DON AL Because if I had no earthly temptation would have
 induced these gentlemen to leave two such extremely fascinating
 and utterly irresistible little ladies
 TESS Theres something in that
 DON AL I may mention that you will not be kept long in
 suspense as the old lady who nursed the Royal child is at
 present in the torture chamber waiting for me to interview her
 GIU Poor old girl Hadnt you better go and put her out
 of her suspense
 DON AL Oh notheres no hurryshes all right She has
 all the illustrated papers However Ill go and interrogate
 her and in the meantime may I suggest the absolute propriety
 of your regarding yourselves as single young ladies Good
 evening
 Exit Don

 lady whom nobody can identify
 GIA And one of us is married to one of you and the other
 is married to nobody
 TESS But which of you is married to which of us and
 whats to become of the other About to cry
 GIU Its quite simple Observe Two husbands have
 managed to acquire three wives Three wivestwo husbands
 Reckoning up Thats twothirds of a husband to each wife

 GIU Youve no right to call me a vulgar fraction

 Announce these comers

 Comes Baratarias highborn bride
 Ye sounding cymbals clang
 She comes to claim the Royal hand
 Proclaim their Graces
 O ye double basses
 Of the King who rules this goodly land
 Ye brazen brasses bang

 DUKE to his attendants Be good enough to inform His Majesty
 that His Grace the Duke of PlazaToro Limited has arrived and
 begs
 CAS Desires
 DUCH Demands
 DUKE And demands an audience Exeunt attendants And
 now my child prepare to receive the husband to whom you were
 united under such interesting and romantic circumstances
 CAS But which is it There are two of them
 DUKE It is true that at present His Majesty is a double
 gentleman but as soon as the circumstances of his marriage are
 ascertained he will ipso facto boil down to a single
 gentlemanthus presenting a unique example of an individual who
 becomes a single man and a married man by the same operation
 DUCH severely I have known instances in which the
 characteristics of both conditions existed concurrently in the
 same individual
 DUKE Ah he couldnt have been a PlazaToro
 DUCH Oh couldnt he though
 CAS Well whatever happens I shall of course be a
 dutiful wife but I can never love my husband
 DUKE I dont know Its extraordinary what
 unprepossessing people one can love if one gives ones mind to
 it
 DUCH I loved your father
 DUKE My lovethat remark is a little hard I think
 Rather cruel perhaps Somewhat uncalledfor I venture to
 believe
 DUCH It was very difficult my dear but I said to myself
 That man is a Duke and I will love him Several of my
 relations bet me I couldnt but I diddesperately

 SONGDUCHESS

 On the day when I was wedded
 To your admirable sire
 I acknowledge that I dreaded
 An explosion of his ire
 I was overcome with panic
 For his temper was volcanic
 And I didnt dare revolt
 For I feared a thunderbolt
 I was always very wary
 For his fury was ecstatic
 His refined vocabulary
 Most unpleasantly emphatic
 To the thunder
 Of this Tartar
 I knocked under
 Like a martyr
 When intently
 He was fuming
 I was gently
 Unassuming
 When reviling
 Me completely
 I was smiling
 Very sweetly
 Giving him the very best and getting back the very worst
 That is how I tried to tame your great progenitorat first
 But I found that a reliance
 On my threatening appearance
 And a resolute defiance
 Of marital interference
 And a gentle intimation
 Of my firm determination
 To see what I could do
 To be wife and husband too
 Was the only thing required
 For to make his temper supple
 And you couldnt have desired
 A more reciprocating couple
 Ever willing
 To be wooing
 We were billing
 We were cooing
 When I merely
 From him parted
 We were nearly
 Brokenhearted
 When in sequel
 Reunited
 We were equal
 Ly delighted
 So with doubleshotted guns and colours nailed unto the mast
 I tamed your insignificant progenitorat last

 CAS My only hope is that when my husband sees what a shady

 BERTHA OLGA MARTHA and other members of ERNEST DUMMKOPFS

 tables enjoying a repast in honour of the nuptials of LUDWIG
 his leading comedian and LISA his soubrette

 CHORUS

 Wont it be a pretty wedding
 Will not Lisa look delightful
 Smiles and tears in plenty shedding
 Which in brides of course is rightful
 One could say if one were spiteful
 Contradiction little dreading
 Her bouquet is simply frightful
 Still twill be a pretty wedding
 Oh it is a pretty wedding
 Such a pretty pretty wedding

 ELSA If her dress is badly fitting
 Theirs the fault who made her trousseau

 LUDWIG and LISA come forward

 DUETLUDWIG and LISA

 LUD Pretty Lisa fair and tasty
 Tell me now and tell me truly
 Havent you been rather hasty
 Havent you been rash unduly
 Am I quite the dashing sposo
 That your fancy could depict you
 Perhaps you think Im only soso
 She expresses admiration
 Well I will not contradict you

 CHORUS No he will not contradict you

 LISA Who am I to raise objection
 Im a child untaught and homely
 When you tell me youre perfection
 Tender truthful true and comely
 That in quarrel no ones bolder
 Though dissensions always grieve you
 Why my love youre so much older
 That of course I must believe you

 CHORUS Yes of course she must believe you

 CHORUS
 If he ever acts unkindly
 Shut your eyes and love him blindly
 Should he call you names uncomely
 Shut your mouth and love him dumbly
 Should he rate you rightlyleftly
 Shut your ears and love him deafly
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
 Thus and thus and thus alone
 Ludwigs wife may hold her own

 LUDWIG and LISA sit at table

 Enter NOTARY TANNHAUSER

 NOT Hallo Surely Im not late All chatter
 unintelligibly in reply
 NOT But dear me youre all at breakfast Has the
 wedding taken place All chatter unintelligibly in reply
 NOT My good girls one at a time I beg Let me
 understand the situation As solicitor to the conspiracy to
 dethrone the Grand Dukea conspiracy in which the members of
 this company are deeply involvedI am invited to the marriage of
 two of its members I present myself in due course and I find
 not only that the ceremony has taken placewhich is not of the
 least consequence but the wedding breakfast is half
 eatenwhich is a consideration of the most serious importance

 LUDWIG and LISA come down

 LUD But the ceremony has not taken place We cant get a
 parson
 NOT Cant get a parson Why hows that Theyre three
 a
 penny
 LUD Oh its the old storythe Grand Duke
 ALL Ugh
 LUD It seems that the little imp has selected this our
 wedding day for a convocation of all the clergy in the town to
 settle the details of his approaching marriage with the
 enormously wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt and there wont be a
 parson to be had for love or money until six oclock this
 evening
 LISA And as we produce our magnificent classical revival
 of Troilus and Cressida tonight at seven we have no alternative
 but to eat our wedding breakfast before weve earned it So sit
 down and make the best of it
 GRET Oh I should like to pull his Grand Ducal ears for
 him that I should Hes the meanest the cruellest the most
 spiteful little ape in Christendom
 OLGA Well we shall soon be freed from his tyranny
 Tomorrow the Despot is to be dethroned
 LUD Hush rash girl You know not what you say
 OLGA Dont be absurd Were all in itwere all tiled
 here
 LUD That has nothing to do with it Know ye not that in
 alluding to our conspiracy without having first given and
 received the secret sign you are violating a fundamental
 principle of our Association

 SONGLUDWIG

 By the mystic regulation
 Of our dark Association
 Ere you open conversation
 With another kindred soul
 You must eat a sausageroll Producing one

 ALL You must eat a sausageroll

 LUD If in turn he eats another
 Thats a sign that hes a brother
 Each may fully trust the other
 It is quaint and it is droll
 But its bilious on the whole

 ALL Very bilious on the whole

 LUD Its a greasy kind of pasty
 Which perhaps a judgement hasty
 Might consider rather tasty
 Once to speak without disguise
 It found favour in our eyes

 ALL It found favour in our eyes

 LUD But when youve been six months feeding
 As we have on this exceeding
 Bilious food its no illbreeding
 If at these repulsive pies
 Our offended gorges rise

 ALL Our offended gorges rise

 MARTHA Oh bother the secret sign Ive eaten it until
 Im quite uncomfortable Ive given it six times already
 todayand whimpering I cant eat any breakfast
 BERTHA And its so unwholesome Why we should all be as
 yellow as frogs if it wasnt for the makeup
 LUD All this is rank treason to the cause I suffer as
 much as any of you I loathe the repulsive thingI cant
 contemplate it without a shudderbut Im a conscientious
 conspirator and if you wont give the sign I will Eats
 sausageroll with an effort
 LISA Poor martyr Hes always at it and its a wonder
 where he puts it
 NOT Well now about Troilus and Cressida What do you
 play
 LUD struggling with his feelings If youll be so
 obliging as to wait until Ive got rid of this feeling of warm
 oil at the bottom of my throat Ill tell you all about it
 LISA gives him some brandy Thank you my love its gone
 Well the piece will be produced upon a scale of unexampled
 magnificence It is confidently predicted that my appearance as
 King Agamemnon in a Louis Quatorze wig will mark an epoch in
 the theatrical annals of Pfennig Halbpfennig I endeavoured to
 persuade Ernest Dummkopf our manager to lend us the classical
 dresses for our marriage Think of the effect of a real Athenian
 wedding procession cavorting through the streets of Speisesaal
 Torches burningcymbals bangingflutes tootlingcitharae
 twangingand a throng of fifty lovely Spartan virgins capering
 before us all down the High Street singing Eloia Eloia
 Opoponax Eloia It would have been tremendous
 NOT And he declined
 LUD He did on the prosaic ground that it might rain and
 the ancient Greeks didnt carry umbrellas If as is confidently
 expected Ernest Dummkopf is elected to succeed the dethroned
 one mark any words he will make a mess of it
 Exit LUDWIG with LISA
 OLGA Hes sure to be elected His entire company has
 promised to plump for him on the understanding that all the
 places about the Court are filled by members of his troupe
 according to professional precedence

 ERNEST enters in great excitement

 BERTHA looking off Here comes Ernest Dummkopf Now we
 shall know all about it
 ALL Wellwhats the news How is the election going
 ERN Oh its a certaintya practical certainty Two of
 the candidates have been arrested for debt and the third is a
 baby in armsso if you keep your promises and vote solid Im
 cocksure of election
 OLGA Trust to us But you remember the conditions
 ERN Yesall of you shall be provided for for life
 Every man shall be ennobledevery lady shall have unlimited
 credit at the Court Milliners and all salaries shall be paid
 weekly in advance
 GRET Oh its quite clear he knows how to rule a Grand
 Duchy
 ERN Rule a Grand Duchy Why my good girl for ten years
 past Ive ruled a theatrical company A man who can do that can
 rule anything

 SONGERNEST

 Were I a king in very truth
 And had a sona guileless youth
 In probable succession
 To teach him patience teach him tact
 How promptly in a fix to act
 He should adopt in point of fact
 A managers profession
 To that condition he should stoop
 Despite a too fond mother
 With eight or ten stars in his troupe
 All jealous of each other
 Oh the man who can rule a theatrical crew
 Each member a genius and some of them two
 And manage to humour them little and great
 Can govern this tuppenny State

 ALL Oh the man etc

 Both A and B rehearsal slight
 They say theyll be all right at night
 Theyve both to go to school yet
 C in each act must change her dress
 D will attempt to square the press
 E wont play Romeo unless
 His grandmother plays Juliet
 F claims all hoydens as her rights
 Shes played them thirty seasons
 And G must show herself in tights
 For two convincing reasons
 Two very wellshaped reasons
 Oh the man who can drive a theatrical team
 With wheelers and leaders in order supreme
 Can govern and rule with a wave of his fin
 All Europewith Ireland thrown in

 ALL Oh the man etc
 Exeunt all but ERNEST

 ERN Elected by my fellowconspirators to be Grand Duke of
 Pfennig Halbpfennig as soon as the contemptible little occupant
 of the historical throne is deposedhere is promotion indeed
 Why instead of playing Troilus of Troy for a month I shall play
 Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig for a lifetime Yet am I
 happy Nofar from happy The lovely English comdiennethe
 beautiful Julia whose dramatic ability is so overwhelming that
 our audiences forgive even her strong English accentthat rare
 and radiant being treats my respectful advances with disdain
 unutterable And yet who knows She is haughty and ambitious
 and it may be that the splendid change in my fortunes may work a
 corresponding change in her feelings towards me

 Enter JULIA JELLICOE

 JULIA Herr Dummkopf a word with you if you please
 ERN Beautiful English maiden
 JULIA No compliments I beg I desire to speak with you
 on a
 purely professional matter so we will if you please dispense
 with
 allusions to my personal appearance which can only tend to widen
 the
 breach which already exists between us
 ERN aside My only hope shattered The haughty
 Londoner
 still despises me Aloud It shall be as you will
 JULIA I understand that the conspiracy in which we are
 all
 concerned is to develop tomorrow and that the company is likely
 to elect you to the throne on the understanding that the posts
 about the Court are to be filled by members of your theatrical
 troupe according to their professional importance
 ERN That is so
 JULIA Then all I can say is that it places me in an
 extremely awkward position
 ERN very depressed I dont see how it concerns you
 JULIA Why bless my heart dont you see that as your
 leading lady I am bound under a serious penalty to play the
 leading part in all your productions
 ERN Well
 JULIA Why of course the leading part in this production
 will be the Grand Duchess
 ERN My wife
 JULIA That is another way of expressing the same idea
 ERN asidedelighted I scarcely dared even to hope
 for
 this
 JULIA Of course as your leading lady youll be mean
 enough to hold me to the terms of my agreement Oh thats so
 like a man Well I suppose theres no help for itI shall have
 to do it
 ERN aside Shes mine Aloud Butdo you really
 think you would care to play that part Taking her hand
 JULIA withdrawing it Care to play it Certainly
 notbut what am I to do Business is business and I am bound
 by the terms of my agreement
 ERN Its for a long run minda run that may last many
 many yearsno understudyand once embarked upon theres no
 throwing it up
 JULIA Oh were used to these long runs in England they
 are the curse of the stagebut you see Ive no option
 ERN You think the part of Grand Duchess will be good
 enough for you
 JULIA Oh I think so Its a very good part in
 Gerolstein and oughtnt to be a bad one in Pfennig Halbpfennig
 Why what did you suppose I was going to play
 ERN keeping up a show of reluctance But considering
 your strong personal dislike to me and your persistent rejection
 of my repeated offers wont you find it difficult to throw
 yourself into the part with all the impassioned enthusiasm that
 the character seems to demand Remember its a strongly
 emotional part involving long and repeated scenes of rapture
 tenderness adoration devotionall in luxuriant excess and all
 of the most demonstrative description
 JULIA My good sir throughout my career I have made it a
 rule never to allow private feeling to interfere with my
 professional duties You may be quite sure that however
 distasteful the part may be if I undertake it I shall consider
 myself professionally bound to throw myself into it with all the
 ardour at my command
 ERN asidewith effusion Im the happiest fellow
 alive
 Aloud Nowwould you have any objectiontoto give me some
 ideaif its only a mere sketchas to how you would play it
 It would be really interestingto meto know your conception
 ofofthe part of my wife
 JULIA How would I play it Now let me seelet me see
 Considering Ah I have it

 BALLADJULIA

 How would I play this part
 The Grand Dukes Bride
 All rancour in my heart
 Id duly hide
 Id drive it from my recollection
 And whelm you with a mock affection
 Well calculated to defy detection
 Thats how Id play this part
 The Grand Dukes Bride

 With many a winsome smile
 Id witch and woo
 With gay and girlish guile
 Id frenzy you
 Id madden you with my caressing
 Like turtle her first love confessing
 That it was mock no mortal would be
 guessing
 With so much winsome wile
 Id witch and woo

 Did any other maid
 With you succeed
 Id pinch the forward jade
 I would indeed
 With jealous frenzy agitated
 Which would of course be simulated
 Id make her wish shed never been created
 Did any other maid
 With you succeed

 And should there come to me
 Some summers hence
 In all the childish glee
 Of innocence
 Fair babes aglow with beauty vernal
 My heart would bound with joy diurnal
 This sweet display of sympathy maternal
 Well that would also be
 A mere pretence

 My histrionic art
 Though you deride
 Thats how Id play that part
 The Grand Dukes Bride

 ENSEMBLE
 ERNEST JULIA
 Oh joy when two glowing young My boy when two
 glowing
 hearts young hearts

 From the rise of the curtain From the rise of the
 curtain
 Thus throw themselves into their Thus throw themselves
 into
 their parts parts
 Success is most certain Success is most
 certain
 If the role youre prepared to endow The role Im prepared
 to
 endow
 With such delicate touches With most delicate
 touch
 es
 By the heaven above us I vow By the heaven above us
 I
 vow
 You shall be my Grand Duchess I will be your Grand
 Duchess



 Dance

 Enter all the Chorus with LUDWIG NOTARY
 and LISAall greatly agitated

 EXCITED CHORUS

 My goodness me What shall we do Why what a dreadful
 situation
 To LUD Its all your fault you booby youyou lump of
 indiscrimination
 Im sure I dont know where to goits put me into such a
 tetter
 But this at all events I knowthe sooner we are off the
 better

 ERN What means this agitato What dye seek
 As your Grand Duke elect I bid you speak

 SONGLUDWIG

 Ten minutes since I met a chap
 Who bowed an easy salutation
 Thinks I This gentleman mayhap
 Belongs to our Association
 But on the whole
 Uncertain yet
 A sausageroll
 I took and eat
 That chap replied I dont embellish
 By eating three with obvious relish

 CHORUS angrily Why gracious powers
 No chum of ours
 Could eat three sausagerolls with relish

 LUD Quite reassured I let him know
 Our ploteach incident explaining
 That stranger chuckled much as though
 He thought me highly entertaining
 I told him all
 Both bad and good
 I bade him call
 He said he would
 I added muchthe more I muckled
 The more that chuckling chummy chuckled

 ALL angrily A bat could see
 He couldnt be
 A chum of ours if he chuckled

 LUD Well as I bowed to his applause
 Down dropped he with hysteric bellow
 And that seemed right enough because
 I am a devilish funny fellow
 Then suddenly
 As still he squealed
 It flashed on me
 That Id revealed
 Our plot with all details effective
 To Grand Duke Rudolphs own detective

 ALL What folly fell
 To go and tell
 Our plot to any ones detective

 CHORUS

 Attacking LUDWIG You booby dense
 You oaf immense
 With no pretence
 To common sense
 A stupid muff
 Whos made of stuff
 Not worth a puff
 Of candlesnuff

 Pack up at once and off we go unless were anxious to exhibit
 Our fairy forms all in a row strung up upon the Castle gibbet

 Exeunt Chorus Manent LUDWIG LISA
 ERNEST JULIA and NOTARY
 JULIA Well a nice mess youve got us into Theres an
 end of our precious plot All uppopfizzlebangdone for
 LUD Yes butha hafancy my choosing the Grand Dukes
 private detective of all men to make a confidant of When you
 come to think of it its really devilish funny
 ERN angrily When you come to think of it its
 extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every
 puddingheaded baboon who presents himself
 LUD YesI should never do that If I were chairman of
 this gang I should hesitate to enrol any baboon who couldnt
 produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological
 Gardens
 LISA Ludwig is far from being a baboon Poor boy he
 could not help giving us awayits his trusting naturehe was
 deceived
 JULIA furiously His trusting nature To LUDWIG Oh
 I should like to talk to you in my own language for five
 minutesonly five minutes I know some good strong energetic
 English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into
 raisinsonly you wouldnt understand them
 LUD Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a
 neglected education
 ERN to JULIA And I suppose youll never be my Grand
 Duchess now
 JULIA Grand Duchess My good friend if you dont
 produce
 the piece how can I play the part
 ERN True To LUDWIG You see what youve done
 LUD But my dear sir you dont seem to understand that
 the man ate three sausagerolls Keep that fact steadily before
 you Three large sausagerolls
 JULIA BahLots of people eat sausagerolls who are not
 conspirators
 LUD Then they shouldnt Its bad form Its not the
 game When one of the Human Family proposes to eat a
 sausageroll it is his duty to ask himself Am I a
 conspirator And if on examination he finds that he is not a
 conspirator he is bound in honour to select some other form of
 refreshment
 LISA Of course he is One should always play the game
 To NOTARY who has been smiling placidly through this What
 are you grinning at you greedy old man
 NOT Nothingdont mind me It is always amusing to the
 legal mind to see a parcel of laymen bothering themselves about a
 matter which to a trained lawyer presents no difficulty whatever
 ALL No difficulty
 NOT None whatever The way out of it is quite simple
 ALL Simple
 NOT Certainly Now attend In the first place you two
 men fight a Statutory Duel
 ERN A Statutory Duel
 JULIA A Stattattatutory Duel Ach what a crackjaw
 language this German is
 LUD Never heard of such a thing
 NOT It is true that the practice has fallen into abeyance
 through disuse But all the laws of Pfennig Halbpfennig run for
 a hundred years when they die a natural death unless in the
 meantime they have been revived for another century The Act
 that institutes the Statutory Duel was passed a hundred years
 ago and as it has never been revived it expires tomorrow So
 youre just in time
 JULIA But what is the use of talking to us about
 Statutory
 Duels when we none of us know what a Statutory Duel is
 NOT Dont you Then Ill explain

 SONGNOTARY

 About a century since
 The code of the duello
 To sudden death
 For want of breath
 Sent many a strapping fellow
 The then presiding Prince
 Who useless bloodshed hated
 He passed an Act
 Short and compact
 Which may be briefly stated
 Unlike the complicated laws
 A Parliamentary draftsman draws
 It may be briefly stated

 ALL We know that complicated laws
 Such as a legal draftsman draws
 Cannot be briefly stated

 NOT By this ingenious law
 If any two shall quarrel
 They may not fight
 With falchions bright
 Which seemed to him immoral
 But each a card shall draw
 And he who draws the lowest
 Shall so twas said
 Be thenceforth dead
 In fact a legal ghoest
 When exigence of rhyme compels
 Orthography forgoes her spells
 And ghost is written ghoest

 ALL aside With what an emphasis he dwells
 Upon orthography and spells
 That kind of funs the lowest

 NOT When off the losers popped
 By pleasing legal fiction
 And friend and foe
 Have wept their woe
 In counterfeit affliction
 The winner must adopt
 The losers poor relations
 Discharge his debts
 Pay all his bets
 And take his obligations

 In short to briefly sum the case
 The winner takes the losers place
 With all its obligations

 ALL How neatly lawyers state a case
 The winner takes the losers place
 With all its obligations

 LUD I see The man who draws the lowest card
 NOT Dies ipso facto a social death He loses all his
 civil rightshis identity disappearsthe Revising Barrister
 expunges his name from the list of voters and the winner takes
 his place whatever it may be discharges all his functions and
 adopts all his responsibilities
 ERN This is all very well as far as it goes but it only
 protects one of us Whats to become of the survivor
 LUD Yes thats an interesting point because I might be
 the survivor
 NOT The survivor goes at once to the Grand Duke and in
 a
 burst of remorse denounces the dead man as the moving spirit of
 the plot He is accepted as Kings evidence and as a matter of
 course receives a free pardon Tomorrow when the law expires
 the dead man will ipso facto come to life againthe Revising
 Barrister will restore his name to the list of voters and he
 will resume all his obligations as though nothing unusual had
 happened
 JULIA When he will be at once arrested tried and
 executed on the evidence of the informer Candidly my friend I
 dont think much of your plot
 NOT Dear dear dear the ignorance of the laity My
 good
 young lady it is a beautiful maxim of our glorious Constitution
 that a man can only die once Death expunges crime and when he
 comes to life again it will be with a clean slate
 ERN Its really very ingenious
 LUD to NOTARY My dear sir we owe you our lives
 LISA aside to LUDWIG May I kiss him
 LUD Certainly not youre a big girl now To ERNEST
 Well miscreant are you prepared to meet me on the field of
 honour
 ERN At once By Jove what a couple of fireeaters we
 are
 LISA Ludwig doesnt know what fear is
 LUD Oh I dont mind this sort of duel
 ERN Its not like a duel with swords I hate a duel with
 swords Its not the blade I mindits the blood
 LUD And I hate a duel with pistols Its not the ball I
 mindits the bang
 NOT Altogether it is a great improvement on the old
 method
 of giving satisfaction

 QUINTET
 LUDWIG LISA NOTARY ERNEST JULIA

 Two young fellows quarrel
 Then they fight for both are bold
 Rage of both is uncontrolled
 Both are stretched out stark and cold
 Prithee wheres the moral

 Theres an end to further action
 And this barbarous transaction
 Is described as satisfaction
 Ha ha ha ha satisfaction

 Each is laid in churchyard mould
 Strange the views some people hold

 Better than the method old
 Which was coarse and cruel
 Is the plan that weve extolled
 Sing thy virtues manifold
 Better than refined gold

 Sword or pistol neither uses
 Playing card he lightly chooses
 And the loser simply loses

 March Enter the seven Chamberlains of the
 GRAND DUKE RUDOLPH

 CHORUS OF CHAMBERLAINS

 The good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig
 Though in his own opinion very very big
 In point of fact hes nothing but a miserable prig
 Is the good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig

 Though quite contemptible as every one agrees
 We must dissemble if we want our bread and cheese
 So hail him in a chorus with enthusiasm big
 The good Grand Duke of Pfennig Halbpfennig

 Enter the GRAND DUKE RUDOLPH He is meanly and miserably dressed
 in old and patched clothes but blazes with a profusion of
 orders and decorations He is very weak and ill from low
 living

 SONGRUDOLPH

 A pattern to professors of monarchical autonomy
 I dont indulge in levity or compromising bonhomie
 But dignified formality consistent with economy
 Above all other virtues I particularly prize
 I never join in merrimentI dont see joke or jape any
 I never tolerate familiarity in shape any
 This joined with an extravagant respect for
 tuppencehapenny
 A keynote to my character sufficiently supplies

 Speaking Observe To Chamberlains My snuffbox

 The snuffbox is passed with much ceremony from the Junior
 Chamberlain through all the others until it is presented
 by the Senior Chamberlain to RUDOLPH who uses it

 That incident a keynote to my character supplies

 RUD I weigh out tea and sugar with precision mathematical
 Instead of beer a penny eachmy orders are emphatical
 Extravagance unpardonable any more than that I call
 But on the other hand my Ducal dignity to keep
 All Courtly ceremonialto put it comprehensively
 I rigidly insist upon but not I hope offensively
 Whenever ceremonial can be practised inexpensively
 And when you come to think of it its really very
 cheap

 Speaking Observe To Chamberlains My handkerchief

 Handkerchief is handed by Junior Chamberlain to the next in
 order and so on until it reaches RUDOLPH who is much
 inconvenienced by the delay

 Its sometimes inconvenient but its always very cheap

 RUD My Lord Chamberlain as you are aware my marriage
 with the wealthy Baroness von Krakenfeldt will take place
 tomorrow and you will be good enough to see that the rejoicings
 are on a scale of unusual liberality Pass that on Chamberlain
 whispers to ViceChamberlain who whispers to the next and so
 on The sports will begin with a Wedding Breakfast Bee The
 leading pastrycooks of the town will be invited to compete and
 the winner will not only enjoy the satisfaction of seeing his
 breakfast devoured by the Grand Ducal pair but he will also be
 entitled to have the Arms of Pfennig Halbpfennig tattood between
 his shoulderblades The ViceChamberlain will see to this All
 the public fountains of Speisesaal will run with Gingerbierheim
 and Currantweinmilch at the public expense The Assistant
 ViceChamberlain will see to this At night everybody will
 illuminate and as I have no desire to tax the public funds
 unduly this will be done at the inhabitants private expense
 The Deputy Assistant ViceChamberlain will see to this All my
 Grand Ducal subjects will wear new clothes and the SubDeputy
 Assistant ViceChamberlain will collect the usual commission on
 all sales Wedding presents which on this occasion should be
 on a scale of extraordinary magnificence will be received at the
 Palace at any hour of the twentyfour and the Temporary
 SubDeputy Assistant ViceChamberlain will sit up all night for
 this purpose The entire population will be commanded to enjoy
 themselves and with this view the Acting Temporary SubDeputy
 Assistant ViceChamberlain will sing comic songs in the
 Marketplace from noon to nightfall Finally we have composed a
 Wedding Anthem with which the entire population are required to
 provide themselves It can be obtained from our Grand Ducal
 publishers at the usual discount price and all the Chamberlains
 will be expected to push the sale Chamberlains bow and
 exeunt I dont feel at all comfortable I hope Im not doing
 a foolish thing in getting married After all its a poor heart
 that never rejoices and this wedding of mine is the first little
 treat Ive allowed myself since my christening Besides
 Carolines income is very considerable and as her ideas of
 economy are quite on a par with mine it ought to turn out well
 Bless her tough old heart shes a mean little darling Oh here
 she is punctual to her appointment

 Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT

 BAR Rudolph Why whats the matter
 RUD Why Im not quite myself my pet Im a little
 worried and upset I want a tonic Its the low diet I think
 I am afraid after all I shall have to take the bull by the
 horns and have an egg with my breakfast
 BAR I shouldnt do anything rash dear Begin with a
 jujube Gives him one
 RUD about to eat it but changes his mind Ill keep it
 for supper He sits by her and tries to put his arm round her
 waist
 BAR Rudolph dont What in the world are you thinking
 of
 RUD I was thinking of embracing you my sugarplum Just
 as a little cheap treat
 BAR What here In public Really you appear to have
 no
 sense of delicacy
 RUD No sense of delicacy Bonbon
 BAR No I cant make you out When you courted me all
 your courting was done publicly in the Marketplace When you
 proposed to me you proposed in the Marketplace And now that
 were engaged you seem to desire that our first tte
 occur in the Marketplace Surely youve a room in your
 Palacewith blindsthat would do
 RUD But my own I cant help myself Im bound by my
 own
 decree
 BAR Your own decree
 RUD Yes You see all the houses that give on the
 Marketplace belong to me but the drains which date back to the
 reign of Charlemagne want attending to and the houses wouldnt
 letso with a view to increasing the value of the property I
 decreed that all loveepisodes between affectionate couples
 should take place in public on this spot every Monday
 Wednesday and Friday when the band doesnt play
 BAR Bless me what a happy idea So moral too And have
 you found it answer
 RUD Answer The rents have gone up fifty per cent and
 the sale of operaglasses which is a Grand Ducal monopoly has
 received an extraordinary stimulus So under the circumstances
 would you allow me to put my arm round your waist As a source
 of income Just once
 BAR But its so very embarrassing Think of the
 operaglasses
 RUD My good girl thats just what I am thinking of
 Hang
 it all we must give them something for their money Whats
 that
 BAR unfolding paper which contains a large letter
 which
 she hands to him Its a letter which your detective asked me
 to hand to you I wrapped it up in yesterdays paper to keep it
 clean
 RUD Oh its only his report Thatll keep But I say
 youve never been and bought a newspaper
 BAR My dear Rudolph do you think Im mad It came
 wrapped round my breakfast
 RUD relieved I thought you were not the sort of girl
 to
 go and buy a newspaper Well as weve got it we may as well
 read it What does it say
 BAR Whydear meheres your biography Our Detested
 Despot
 RUD YesI fancy that refers to me
 BAR And it saysOh it cant be
 RUD What cant be
 BAR Why it says that although youre going to marry me
 tomorrow you were betrothed in infancy to the Princess of Monte
 Carlo
 RUD Oh yesthats quite right Didnt I mention it
 BAR Mention it You never said a word about it
 RUD Well it doesnt matter because you see its
 practically off
 BAR Practically off
 RUD Yes By the terms of the contract the betrothal is
 void unless the Princess marries before she is of age Now her
 father the Prince is stonybroke and hasnt left his house for
 years for fear of arrest Over and over again he has implored me
 to come to him to be marriedbut in vain Over and over again he
 has implored me to advance him the money to enable the Princess
 to come to mebut in vain I am very young but not as young as
 that and as the Princess comes of age at two tomorrow why at
 two tomorrow Im a free man so I appointed that hour for our
 wedding as I shall like to have as much marriage as I can get
 for my money
 BAR I see Of course if the married state is a happy
 state its a pity to waste any of it
 RUD Why every hour we delayed I should lose a lot of you
 and youd lose a lot of me
 BAR My thoughtful darling Oh Rudolph we ought to be
 very happy
 RUD If Im not itll be my first bad investment Still
 there is such a thing as a slump even in Matrimonials
 BAR I often picture us in the long cold dark December
 evenings sitting close to each other and singing impassioned
 duets to keep us warm and thinking of all the lovely things we
 could afford to buy if we chose and at the same time planning
 out our lives in a spirit of the most rigid and exacting economy
 RUD Its a most beautiful and touching picture of
 connubial bliss in its highest and most rarefied development

 DUETBARONESS and RUDOLPH

 BAR As oer our penny roll we sing
 It is not reprehensive
 To think what joys our wealth would bring
 Were we disposed to do the thing
 Upon a scale extensive
 Theres rich mockturtlethick and clear

 BAR delighted You are an openhanded dear

 RUD Though mind you its expensive

 BAR No doubt it is expensive

 BOTH How fleeting are the gluttons joys
 With fish and fowl he lightly toys

 RUD And pays for such expensive tricks
 Sometimes as much as twoandsix

 BAR As twoandsix

 RUD As twoandsix

 BOTH Sometimes as much as twoandsix

 BAR It gives him no advantage mind
 For you and he have only dined
 And you remain when once its down
 A better man by halfacrown

 I moisten my insipid fare
 With waterwhich I cant abear

 RUD Nor II cant abide it

 BAR This pleasing fact our souls will cheer
 With fifty thousand pounds a year
 We could indulge in table beer

 Exit
 BARONESS

 RUD Oh now for my detectives report Opens letter
 Whats this Another conspiracy A conspiracy to depose me
 And my private detective was so convulsed with laughter at the
 notion of a conspirator selecting him for a confidant that he was
 physically unable to arrest the malefactor Why itll come
 off This comes of engaging a detective with a keen sense of the
 ridiculous For the future Ill employ none but Scotchmen And
 the plot is to explode tomorrow My wedding day Oh
 Caroline Caroline Weeps This is perfectly frightful
 Whats to be done I dont know I ought to keep cool and
 think but you cant think when your veins are full of hot
 sodawater and your brains fizzing like a firework and all
 your faculties are jumbled in a perfect whirlpool of
 tumblication And Im going to be ill I know I am Ive been
 living too low and Im going to be very ill indeed

 SONGRUDOLPH

 When you find youre a brokendown critter
 Who is all of a trimmle and twitter
 With your palate unpleasantly bitter
 As if youd just eaten a pill
 When your legs are as thin as dividers
 And youre plagued with unruly insiders
 And your spine is all creepy with spiders
 And youre highly gamboge in the gill
 When youve got a beehive in your head
 And a sewing machine in each ear
 And you feel that youve eaten your bed
 And youve got a bad headache down here
 When such facts are about
 And these symptoms you find
 In your body or crown
 Well youd better look out
 You may make up your mind
 You had better lie down

 When your lips are all smearylike tallow
 And your tongue is decidedly yallow
 With a pint of warm oil in your swallow
 And a pound of tintacks in your chest
 When youre down in the mouth with the vapours
 And all over your Morris wallpapers
 Blackbeetles are cutting their capers
 And crawly things never at rest
 When you doubt if your head is your own
 And you jump when an open door slams
 Then youve got to a state which is known
 To the medical world as jimjams
 If such symptoms you find
 In your body or head
 Theyre not easy to quell
 You may make up your mind
 You are better in bed
 For youre not at all well

 Sinks exhausted and weeping at foot of well

 Enter LUDWIG

 LUD Now for my confession and full pardon They told me
 the Grand Duke was dancing duets in the Marketplace but I dont
 see him Sees RUDOLPH Hallo Whos this Aside Why it
 is the Grand Duke
 RUD sobbing Who are you sir who presume to address
 me in person If youve anything to communicate you must fling
 yourself at the feet of my Acting Temporary SubDeputy Assistant
 ViceChamberlain who will fling himself at the feet of his
 immediate superior and so on with successive footflingings
 through the various gradesyour communication will in course of
 time come to my august knowledge
 LUD But when I inform your Highness that in me you see

 most unhappy the most unfortunate the most completely miserable
 man in your whole dominion
 RUD still sobbing You the most miserable man in my
 whole dominion How can you have the face to stand there and say
 such a thing Why look at me Look at me Bursts into
 tears
 LUD Well I wouldnt be a crybaby
 RUD A crybaby If you had just been told that you were
 going to be deposed tomorrow and perhaps blown up with dynamite
 for all I know wouldnt you be a crybaby I do declare if I
 could only hit upon some cheap and painless method of putting an
 end to an existence which has become insupportable I would
 unhesitatingly adopt it
 LUD You would Aside I see a magnificent way out of
 this By Jupiter Ill try it Aloud Are you by any
 chance in earnest

 survivor will have had to bear the brunt of it
 RUD Yes thats all very well but wholl be fool enough
 to be the survivor
 LUD kneeling Actuated by an overwhelming sense of
 attachment to your Grand Ducal person I unhesitatingly offer
 myself as the victim of your subjects fury
 RUD You do Well really thats very handsome I

 LUD Oh yes it is It mixes one up awfully
 RUD But suppose I were to lose
 LUD Oh thats easily arranged Producing cards Ill

 LUD No I dont think I should like to put down a

 LUD Good I saywe must have a devil of a quarrel
 RUD Oh a devil of a quarrel
 LUD Just to give colour to the thing Shall I give you a
 sound thrashing before all the people Say the wordits no

 When they learn the fact tremendous
 That to give this man his gruel

 During this Chorus of men and women have entered all trembling
 with apprehension under the impression that they are to be
 arrested for their complicity in the conspiracy

 CHORUS

 SONGLUDWIG

 Oh a Monarch who boasts intellectual graces
 Can do if he likes a good deal in a day
 He can put all his friends in conspicuous places
 With plenty to eat and with nothing to pay
 Youll tell me no doubt with unpleasant grimaces
 Tomorrow deprived of your ribbons and laces
 Youll get your dismissalwith very long faces
 But wait on that topic Ive something to say
 Dancing Ive something to sayIve something to

 Oh our rule shall be merryIm not an ascetic
 And while the sun shines we will get up our hay

 A very great deal may be done in a day

 CHORUS Oh his rule will be merry etc

 During this LUDWIG whispers to NOTARY who writes

 For instance this measure his ancestor drew it
 alluding to NOTARY
 This law against duelstomorrow will die
 The Duke will revive and youll certainly rue it
 Hell give you what for and hell let you know why
 But in twentyfour hours theres time to renew it
 With a centurys life Ive the right to imbue it
 Its easy to doand by Jingo Ill do it

 Signing paper which NOTARY presents

 Its done Till I perish your Monarch am I
 Your Monarch am Iyour Monarch am Iyour Monarch am I
 Though I do not pretend to be very prophetic

 LISA overwhelmed with grief

 NOT The ladys right Though Julias engagement

 Dramatic contracts which you all adore so
 Are even more so

 ALL Thats very true
 Though marriage contracts etc

 SONGLISA

 The die is cast

 Ludwig and his Julia true
 Wedded are each other to
 So we sing till all is blue
 Eloia Eloia
 Opoponax Eloia

 Wreaths of bay and ivy twine
 Eloia Eloia
 Fill the bowl with Lesbian wine
 And to revelry incline

 For as gaily we pass on
 Probably we shall anon
 Sing a Diergeticon

 RECITLUDWIG

 Your loyalty our Ducal heartstrings touches
 Allow me to present your new Grand Duchess
 Should she offend youll graciously excuse her
 And kindly recollect I didnt choose her

 SONGLUDWIG

 At the outset I may mention its my sovereign intention
 To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best
 For the company possesses all the necessary dresses
 And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the
 rest
 Weve a choir hyporchematic that is balletoperatic
 Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age
 And our clever chorusmaster all but captious criticaster
 Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage
 This return to classic ages is considered in their wages
 Which are always calculated by the day or by the week
 And Ill pay em if theyll back me all in oboloi and drachm
 Which theyll get if they prefer it at the Kalends that
 are Greek

 Confidentially to audience
 At this juncture I may mention
 That this erudition sham
 Is but classical pretension
 The result of steady cram
 Periphrastic methods spurning
 To this audience discerning
 I admit this show of learning
 Is the fruit of steady cram

 CHORUS Periphrastic methods etc

 In the period Socratic every diningroom was Attic
 Which suggests an architecture of a topsyturvy kind
 There theyd satisfy their thirst on a recherche cold Greek
 word
 Which is what they called their lunchand so may you if
 youre inclined
 As they gradually got on theyd four Greek words
 Which is Attic for a steady and a conscientious drink
 But they mixed their wine with waterwhich Im sure they didnt
 oughter
 And we modern Saxons know a trick worth two of that I
 think
 Then came rather risky dances under certain circumstances
 Which would shock that worthy gentleman the Licenser of
 Plays
 Corybantian maniac kickDionysiac or Bacchic
 And the Dithyrambic revels of those undecorous days

 Confidentially to audience
 And perhaps Id better mention
 Lest alarming you I am
 That it isnt our intention
 To perform a Dithyramb
 It displays a lot of stocking
 Which is always very shocking
 And of course Im only mocking
 At the prevalence of cram

 CHORUS It displays a lot etc

 Yes on reconsideration there are customs of that nation
 Which are not in strict accordance with the habits of our
 day
 And when I come to codify their rules I mean to modify
 Or Mrs Grundy praps may have a word or two to say
 For they hadnt macintoshes or umbrellas or goloshes
 And a shower with their dresses must have played the very
 deuce
 And it must have been unpleasing when they caught a fit of
 sneezing
 For it seems of pockethandkerchiefs they didnt know the
 use
 They wore little underclothingscarcely anythingor nothing
 And their dress of Coan silk was quite transparent in
 design
 Well in fact in summer weather something like the altogether
 And its there I rather fancy I shall have to draw the
 line

 Confidentially to audience
 And again I wish to mention
 That this erudition sham
 Is but classical pretension
 The result of steady cram
 Yet my classic lore aggressive
 If youll pardon the possessive
 Is exceedingly impressive
 When youre passing an exam

 CHORUS Yet his classic lore etc

 Exeunt Chorus Manent LUDWIG JULIA and LISA

 LUD recit
 Yes Ludwig and his Julia are mated
 For when an obscure comedian whom the law backs
 To sovereign rank is promptly elevated
 He takes it with its incidental drawbacks
 So Julia and I are duly mated

 LISA through this has expressed intense distress at
 having to surrender LUDWIG

 SONGLISA

 Take care of himhes much too good to live
 With him you must be very gentle
 Poor fellow hes so highly sensitive
 And O so sentimental
 Be sure you never let him sit up late
 In chilly open air conversing
 Poor darling hes extremely delicate
 And wants a deal of nursing

 LUD I want a deal of nursing

 LISA And O remember this
 When he is cross with pain
 A flower and a kiss
 A simple flowera tender kiss
 Will bring him round again

 His moods you must assiduously watch
 When he succumbs to sorrow tragic
 Some hardbake or a bit of butterscotch
 Will work on him like magic
 To contradict a character so rich
 In trusting love were simple blindness
 Hes one of those exalted natures which
 Will only yield to kindness

 LUD I only yield to kindness

 LISA And O the bygone bliss
 And O the present pain
 That flower and that kiss
 That simple flowerthat tender kiss
 I neer shall give again

 Exit
 weeping

 JULIA And now that everybody has gone and were happily
 and comfortably married I want to have a few words with my
 newborn husband
 LUD aside Yes I expect youll often have a few words
 with your newborn husband Aloud Well what is it
 JULIA Why Ive been thinking that as you and I have to
 play our parts for life it is most essential that we should come
 to a definite understanding as to how they shall be rendered
 Now Ive been considering how I can make the most of the Grand
 Duchess
 LUD Have you Well if youll take my advice youll
 make
 a very fine part of it
 JULIA Why thats quite my idea
 LUD I shouldnt make it one of your hoitytoity vixenish
 viragoes
 JULIA You think not
 LUD Oh Im quite clear about that I should make her a
 tender gentle submissive affectionate but not too
 affectionate childwifetimidly anxious to coil herself into
 her husbands heart but kept in check by an awestruck reverence
 for his exalted intellectual qualities and his majestic personal
 appearance
 JULIA Oh that is your idea of a good part
 LUD Yesa wife who regards her husbands slightest wish
 as an inflexible law and who ventures but rarely into his august
 presence unless which would happen seldom he should summon her
 to appear before him A crushed despairing violet whose
 blighted existence would culminate all too soon in a lonely and
 pathetic deathscene A fine part my dear
 JULIA Yes Theres a good deal to be said for your view
 of it Now there are some actresses whom it would fit like a
 glove
 LUD aside I wish Id married one of em
 JULIA But you see I must consider my temperament For
 instance my temperament would demand some strong scenes of
 justifiable jealousy
 LUD Oh theres no difficulty about that You shall have
 them
 JULIA With a lovely but detested rival
 LUD Oh Ill provide the rival
 JULIA Whom I should stabstabstab
 LUD Oh I wouldnt stab her Its been done to death I
 should treat her with a silent and contemptuous disdain and
 delicately withdraw from a position which to one of your
 sensitive nature would be absolutely untenable Dear me I can
 see you delicately withdrawing up centre and off
 JULIA Can you
 LUD Yes Its a fine situationand in your hands full
 of quiet pathos

 DUETLUDWIG and JULIA

 LUD Now Julia come
 Consider it from
 This dainty point of view
 A timid tender
 Feminine gender
 Prompt to coyly coo
 Yet silence seeking
 Seldom speaking
 Till shes spoken to
 A comfy cosy
 Rosyposy
 Innocent ingenoo
 The part youre suited to
 To give the deuce her due
 A sweet O jiminy

 ENSEMBLE

 LUD JULIA

 The part youre suited to Im much obliged to you
 To give the deuce her due I dont think that would do
 A sweet O jiminy To play O jiminy
 Miminypiminy Miminypiminy
 Innocent ingenoo Innocent ingenoo

 JULIA You forget my special magic
 In a high dramatic sense
 Lies in situations tragic
 Undeniably intense
 As Ive justified promotion
 In the histrionic art
 Ill submit to you my notion
 Of a firstrate part

 LUD Well let us see your notion
 Of a firstrate part

 JULIA dramatically
 I have a rival Frenzythrilled
 I find you both together
 My heart stands stillwith horror chilled
 Hard as the millstone nether
 Then softly slyly snaily snaky
 Crawly creepy quaily quaky
 I track her on her homeward way
 As panther tracks her fated prey

 Furiously I fly at her soft white throat
 The lilywhite laughing leman
 On her agonized gaze I gloat
 With the glee of a dancing demon
 My rival sheI have no doubt of her
 So I hold ontill the breath is out of her
 till the breath is out of her

 And thenRemorse Remorse
 O cold unpleasant corse
 Avaunt Avaunt
 That lifeless form
 I gaze upon
 That face still warm
 But weirdly wan
 Those eyes of glass
 I contemplate
 And then alas
 Too latetoo late
 I find she isyour Aunt
 Shuddering Remorse Remorse

 Then madmadmad
 With fancies wildchimerical
 Now sorrowfulsilentsad
 Now hullaballoo hysterical
 Ha ha ha ha
 But whether Im sad or whether Im glad
 Mad mad mad mad

 This calls for the resources of a highclass art
 And satisfies my notion of a firstrate part


 Exit JULIA

 Enter all the Chorus hurriedly and in great excitement

 CHORUS

 Your Highness theres a party at the door
 Your Highness at the door there is a party
 She says that we expect her

 That voice from the tomb
 Oh spectre wont anything lay thee
 Though pained to deny or gainsay thee

 His health and his brides let us toast
 In a magnum of merry champagne

 SONGBARONESS with CHORUS

 I once gave an evening party
 A sandwich and cutorange ball
 But my guests had such appetites hearty
 That I couldnt enjoy it enjoy it at all
 I made a heroic endeavour
 To look unconcerned but in vain
 And I vowd that I neveroh never
 Would ask anybody again
 But theres a distinction decided
 A difference truly immense
 When the wine that you drink is provided provided
 At somebody elses expense
 So bumpersaye ever so many
 The cost we may safely ignore
 For the wine doesnt cost us a penny
 Tho its Pommry seventyfour

 CHORUS So bumpersaye ever so manyetc

 Come bumpersaye ever so many
 And then if you will many more
 This wine doesnt cost us a penny
 Tho its Pommry Pommry seventyfour
 Old wine is a true panacea
 For evry conceivable ill
 When you cherish the soothing idea
 That somebody else pays the bill
 Old wine is a pleasure thats hollow
 When at your own table you sit
 For youre thinking each mouthful you swallow
 Has cost you has cost you a threepennybit
 So bumpersaye ever so many
 And then if you will many more
 This wine doesnt cost us a penny
 Tho its Pommry seventyfour

 CHORUS So bumpersaye ever so manyetc

 Upon our joy encroaching
 Some rascal come apoaching
 Whos heard that wine were broaching

 Remarkable for cut and dried formality

 Reprise of March Exit HERALD

 LUD I have a planIll tell you all the plot of it

 All conceal themselves behind the draperies that enclose the
 stage

 Pompous March Enter the PRINCE and PRINCESS OF MONTE CARLO
 attended by six theatricallooking nobles and the Court
 Costumier

 DUETPrince and PRINCESS

 PRINCE Were rigged out in magnificent array
 Our own clothes are much gloomier
 In costumes which weve hired by the day
 From a very wellknown costumier

 COST bowing I am the wellknown costumier

 PRINCESS With a brilliant staff a Prince should make a show
 Its a rule that never varies
 So weve engaged from the Theatre Monaco
 Six supernumeraries

 NOBLES Were the supernumeraries

 ALL At a salary immense
 Quite regardless of expense
 Six supernumeraries

 PRINCE They do not speak for they break our grammars laws
 And their language is lamentable
 And they never take off their gloves because
 Their nails are not presentable

 NOBLES Our nails are not presentable

 PRINCESS To account for their shortcomings manifest
 We explain in a whisper bated
 They are wealthy members of the brewing interest
 To the Peerage elevated

 NOBLES To the Peerage elevated

 ALL TheyreWere very very rich
 And accordingly as sich
 To the Peerage elevated

 PRINCE Well my dear here we are at lastjust in time
 to
 compel Duke Rudolph to fulfil the terms of his marriage contract
 Another hour and we should have been too late
 PRINCESS Yes papa and if you hadnt fortunately
 discovered a means of making an income by honest industry we
 should never have got here at all
 PRINCE Very true Confined for the last two years within
 the precincts of my palace by an obdurate bootmaker who held a
 warrant for my arrest I devoted my enforced leisure to a study
 of the doctrine of chancesmainly with the view of ascertaining
 whether there was the remotest chance of my ever going out for a
 walk againand this led to the discovery of a singularly
 fascinating little round game which I have called Roulette and
 by which in one sitting I won no less than five thousand
 francs My first act was to pay my bootmakermy second to
 engage a good useful working set of secondhand noblesand my
 third to hurry you off to Pfennig Halbpfennig as fast as a train
 de luxe could carry us
 PRINCESS Yes and a pretty joblot of secondhand nobles
 youve scraped together
 PRINCE doubtfully Pretty you think Humph I dont
 know I should say tollol my loveonly tollol They are not
 wholly satisfactory There is a certain air of unreality about
 themthey are not convincing
 COST But my goot friend vhat can you expect for
 eighteenpence a day
 PRINCE Now take this Peer for instance What the deuce
 do you call him
 COST Him Oh hes a swellhes the Duke of Riviera
 PRINCE Oh hes a Duke is he Well thats no reason
 why
 he should look so confoundedly haughty To Noble Be affable
 sir Noble takes attitude of affability Thats better
 Passing to another Now whos this with his moustache coming
 off
 COST Vhy youre Viscount Mentone aint you
 NOBLE Blest if I know Turning up swordbelt Its
 wrote hereyes Viscount Mentone
 COST Then vhy dont you say so Old yerself upyou
 aint carryin sandwich boards now Adjusts his moustache
 PRINCE Now once for all you Peerswhen His Highness
 arrives dont stand like sticks but appear to take an
 intelligent and sympathetic interest in what is going on You
 neednt say anything but let your gestures be in accordance with
 the spirit of the conversation Now take the word from me
 Affability attitude Submission attitude Surprise
 attitude Shame attitude Grief attitude Joy
 attitude Thats better You can do it if you like
 PRINCESS But papa where in the world is the Court
 There is positively no one here to receive us I cant help
 feeling that Rudolph wants to get out of it because Im poor
 Hes a miserly little wretchthats what he is
 PRINCE Well I shouldnt go so far as to say that I
 should rather describe him as an enthusiastic collector of
 coinsof the realmand we must not be too hard upon a
 numismatist if he feels a certain disinclination to part with
 some of his really very valuable specimens Its a pretty hobby
 Ive often thought I should like to collect some coins myself
 PRINCESS Papa Im sure theres some one behind that
 curtain I saw it move
 PRINCE Then no doubt they are coming Now mind you
 Peershaughty affability combined with a sense of what is due to
 your exalted ranks or Ill fine you half a franc eachupon my
 soul I will

 Gong The curtains fly back and the Court are discovered They
 give a wild yell and rush on to the stage dancing wildly
 with PRINCE PRINCESS and Nobles who are taken by
 surprise
 at first but eventually join in a reckless dance At the
 end all fall down exhausted

 LUD There what do you think of that Thats our
 official
 ceremonial for the reception of visitors of the very highest
 distinction
 PRINCE puzzled Its very quaintvery curious indeed
 Prettily footed too Prettily footed
 LUD Would you like to see how we say goodbye to
 visitors of distinction That ceremony is also performed with
 the foot
 PRINCE Really this toneah but perhaps you have not
 completely grasped the situation
 LUD Not altogether
 PRINCE Ah then Ill give you a lead over
 Significantly I am the father of the Princess of Monte Carlo
 Doesnt that convey any idea to the Grand Ducal mind
 LUD stolidly Nothing definite
 PRINCE aside Hmvery odd Never mindtry again

 significance Twenty years ago Little doddle doddle Two

 equal to the intellectual pressure of the conversation I wish
 hed say something intelligible
 PRINCE You didnt expect me
 LUD jumping at it No no I grasp thatthank you
 very
 much Shaking hands with him No I did not expect you
 PRINCE I thought not But ha ha at last I have escaped

 We sail the ocean blue
 And our saucy ships a beauty

 When at anchor we ride
 On the Portsmouth tide
 We have plenty of time to play

 To his humble wail
 The echoing hills replied

 BALLAD  RALPH

 A maiden fair to see
 The pearl of minstrelsy
 A bud of blushing beauty
 For whom proud nobles sigh
 And with each other vie
 To do her menials duty
 ALL To do her menials duty

 A suitor lowly born
 With hopeless passion torn
 And poor beyond denying
 Has dared for her to pine
 At whose exalted shrine
 A world of wealth is sighing
 ALL A world of wealth is sighing

 Unlearned he in aught
 Save that which love has taught
 For love had been his tutor
 Oh pity pity me
 Our captains daughter she

 she lads
 ALL No no
 DICK No no captains daughters dont marry foremast hands
 ALL recoiling from him Shame shame
 BOAT Dick Deadeye them sentiments o yourn are a disgrace to
 our
 common natur
 RALPH But its a strange anomaly that the daughter of a man
 who hails
 from the quarterdeck may not love another who lays out on the
 foreyard
 arm For a man is but a man whether he hoists his flag at the
 maintruck
 or his slacks on the maindeck
 DICK Ah its a queer world
 RALPH Dick Deadeye I have no desire to press hardly on you
 but such
 a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor
 shudder
 BOAT My lads our gallant captain has come on deck let us
 greet him
 as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves

 BUT Sir you are sad The silent eloquence
 Of yonder tear that trembles on your eyelash
 Proclaims a sorrow far more deep than common
 Confide in mefear notI am a mother

 CAPT Yes Little Buttercup Im sad and sorry
 My daughter Josephine the fairest flower
 That ever blossomed on ancestral timber
 Is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph Porter
 Our Admiraltys First Lord but for some reason
 She does not seem to tackle kindly to it

 BUT with emotion Ah poor Sir Joseph Ah I know too well
 The anguish of a heart that loves but vainly
 But see here comes your most attractive daughter
 I goFarewell
 Exit

 CAPT looking after her A plump and pleasing person
 Exit

 Enter JOSEPHINE twining some flowers which she carries in a
 small
 basket

 BALLAD JOSEPHINE

 Sorry her lot who loves too well
 Heavy the heart that hopes but vainly
 Sad are the sighs that own the spell
 Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly
 Heavy the sorrow that bows the head
 When love is alive and hope is dead

 Sad is the hour when sets the sun
 Dark is the night to earths poor daughters
 When to the ark the wearied one
 Flies from the empty waste of waters
 Heavy the sorrow that bows the head
 When love is alive and hope is dead

 Enter CAPTAIN

 CAPT My child I grieve to see that you are a prey to
 melancholy You
 should look your best today for Sir Joseph Porter KCB will
 be here
 this afternoon to claim your promised hand
 JOS Ah father your words cut me to the quick I can esteem
 reverencevenerate Sir Joseph for he is a great and good man
 but oh I
 cannot love him My heart is already given
 CAPT aside It is then as I feared Aloud Given And to
 whom Not
 to some gilded lordling
 JOS No fatherthe object of my love is no lordling Oh pity
 me for
 he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship
 CAPT Impossible
 JOS Yes it is true
 CAPT A common sailor Oh fie
 JOS I blush for the weakness that allows me to cherish such a
 passion
 I hate myself when I think of the depth to which I have stooped
 in
 permitting myself to think tenderly of one so ignobly born but I
 love
 him I love him I love him Weeps
 CAPT Come my child let us talk this over In a matter of the
 heart I
 would not coerce my daughterI attach but little value to rank
 or
 wealth but the line must be drawn somewhere A man in that
 station may
 be brave and worthy but at every step he would commit solecisms
 that
 society would never pardon
 JOS Oh I have thought of this night and day But fear not
 father I
 have a heart and therefore I love but I am your daughter and
 therefore
 I am proud Though I carry my love with me to the tomb he shall
 never
 never know it

 SONG  SIR JOSEPH

 When I was a lad I served a term
 As office boy to an Attorneys firm
 I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor
 And I polished up the handle of the big front door
 I polished up that handle so carefullee
 That now I am the Ruler of the Queens Navee

 CHORUSHe polished etc

 As office boy I made such a mark
 That they gave me the post of a junior clerk
 I served the writs with a smile so bland
 And I copied all the letters in a big round hand
 I copied all the letters in a hand so free
 That now I am the Ruler of the Queens Navee

 CHORUS He copied etc

 In serving writs I made such a name
 That an articled clerk I soon became
 I wore clean collars and a brandnew suit
 For the pass examination at the Institute
 And that pass examination did so well for me
 That now I am the Ruler of the Queens Navee

 CHORUSAnd that pass examination etc

 Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip
 That they took me into the partnership
 And that junior partnership I ween
 Was the only ship that I ever had seen
 But that kind of ship so suited me
 That now I am the Ruler of the Queens Navee

 CHORUS But that kind etc

 I grew so rich that I was sent
 By a pocket borough into Parliament
 I always voted at my partys call
 And I never thought of thinking for myself at all
 I thought so little they rewarded me
 By making me the Ruler of the Queens Navee

 CHORUS He thought so little etc

 Now landsmen all whoever you may be
 If you want to rise to the top of the tree
 If your soul isnt fettered to an office stool
 Be careful to be guided by this golden rule
 Stick close to your desks and never go to sea
 And you all may be rulers of the Queens Navee

 CHORUSStick close etc

 SIR JOSEPH Then hum this at your leisure Giving him MS
 music It

 GLEERALPH BOATSWAIN BOATSWAINS MATE and CHORUS

 A British tar is a soaring soul
 As free as a mountain bird
 His energetic fist should be ready to resist
 A dictatorial word
 His nose should pant and his lip should curl
 His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl
 His bosom should heave and his heart should glow
 And his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow

 CHORUSHis nose should pant etc

 His eyes should flash with an inborn fire
 His brow with scorn be wrung
 He never should bow down to a domineering frown
 Or the tang of a tyrant tongue
 His foot should stamp and his throat should growl
 His hair should twirl and his face should scowl
 His eyes should flash and his breast protrude
 And this should be his customary attitudepose

 CHORUSHis foot should stamp etc

 All dance off excepting RALPH who remains leaning pensively
 against
 bulwark

 Enter JOSEPHINE from cabin

 JOS It is uselessSir Josephs attentions nauseate me I know
 that he
 is a truly great and good man for he told me so himself but to
 me he
 seems tedious fretful and dictatorial Yet his must be a mind
 of no
 common order or he would not dare to teach my dear father to
 dance a
 hornpipe on the cabin table Sees RALPH Ralph Rackstraw
 Overcome by
 emotion
 RALPH Aye ladyno other than poor Ralph Rackstraw
 JOS aside How my heart beats Aloud And why poor Ralph
 RALPH I am poor in the essence of happiness ladyrich only
 in never
 ending unrest In me there meet a combination of antithetical
 elements
 which are at eternal war with one another Driven hither by
 objective
 influencesthither by subjective emotionswafted one moment
 into
 blazing day by mocking hopeplunged the next into the Cimmerian
 darkness of tangible despair I am but a living ganglion of
 irreconcilable antagonisms I hope I make myself clear lady
 JOS Perfectly Aside His simple eloquence goes to my heart
 Oh if
 I daredbut no the thought is madness Aloud Dismiss these
 foolish
 fancies they torture you but needlessly Come make one effort
 RALPH aside I willone Aloud Josephine
 JOS Indignantly Sir
 RALPH Aye even though Joves armoury were launched at the
 head of the
 audacious mortal whose lips unhallowed by relationship dared to
 breathe
 that precious word yet would I breathe it once and then
 perchance be
 silent evermore Josephine in one brief breath I will
 concentrate the
 hopes the doubts the anxious fears of six weary months
 Josephine I am
 a British sailor and I love you
 JOS Sir this audacity Aside Oh my heart my beating
 heart
 Aloud This unwarrantable presumption on the part of a common
 sailor
 Aside Common oh the irony of the word Crossing aloud
 Oh sir

 RALPH I forget nothing haughty lady I love you desperately
 my life
 is in your handI lay it at your feet Give me hope and what I
 lack in
 education and polite accomplishments that I will endeavour to
 acquire
 Drive me to despair and in death alone I shall look for
 consolation I
 am proud and cannot stoop to implore I have spoken and I wait
 your word
 JOS You shall not wait long Your proffered love I haughtily
 reject
 Go sir and learn to cast your eyes on some village maiden in
 your own
 poor rankthey should be lowered before your captains daughter

 DUETJOSEPHINE and RALPH

 Unfeeling beauty
 You speak and I obey
 It is my duty
 I am the lowliest tar
 That sails the water
 And you proud maiden are
 My captains daughter
 Aside My heart with anguish torn
 Bows down before her
 She laughs my love to scorn
 Yet I adore her

 Repeat refrain ensemble then exit JOSEPHINE into cabin

 DICK DEADEYE

 He thinks hes won his Josephine
 But though the sky is now serene
 A frowning thunderbolt above

 To make his Josephine less coy
 In many various ways Exit

 Exit DICK

 Lets give three cheers for the sailors bride
 Who casts all thought of rank aside
 Who gives up home and fortune too
 For the honest love of a sailor true
 For a British tar is a soaring soul
 As free as a mountain bird

 A dictatorial word
 His foot should stamp and his throat should growl
 His hair should twirl and his face should scowl
 His eyes should flash and his breast protrude
 And this should be his customary attitudepose

 singing on poop deck and accompanying himself on a
 mandolin LITTLE
 BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck gazing sentimentally at
 him

 SONGCAPTAIN

 Fair moon to thee I sing
 Bright regent of the heavens
 Say why is everything
 Either at sixes or at sevens
 I have lived hitherto
 Free from breath of slander
 Beloved by all my crew
 A really popular commander
 But now my kindly crew rebel
 My daughter to a tar is partial
 Sir Joseph storms and sad to tell
 He threatens a court martial
 Fair moon to thee I sing
 Bright regent of the heavens
 Say why is everything
 Either at sixes or at sevens

 BUT How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
 unconscious
 moon Of whom is he thinking Of some highborn beauty It may
 be Who is
 poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
 on one so
 lowly And yet if he knewif he only knew
 CAPT coming down Ah Little Buttercup still on board
 That is
 not quite right little one It would have been more respectable
 to have
 gone on shore at dusk
 BUT True dear Captainbut the recollection of your sad
 pale
 face seemed to chain me to the ship I would fain see you smile
 before I
 go
 CAPT Ah Little Buttercup I fear it will be long before I
 recover my accustomed cheerfulness for misfortunes crowd upon
 me and
 all my old friends seem to have turned against me
 BUT Oh nodo not say all dear Captain That were
 unjust to
 one at least
 CAPT True for you are staunch to me Aside If ever I
 gave my
 heart again methinks it would be to such a one as this Aloud
 I am
 touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me and were we
 differently situated I think I could have returned it But as it
 is I
 fear I can never be more to you than a friend
 BUT I understand You hold aloof from me because you are
 rich and
 loftyand I poor and lowly But take care The poor bumboat
 woman has
 gipsy blood in her veins and she can read destinies
 CAPT Destinies
 BUT There is a change in store for you
 CAPT A change
 BUT Ayebe prepared

 Skim milk masquerades as cream
 Highlows pass as patent leathers

 Storks turn out to be but logs
 Bulls are but inflated frogs

 Turbot is ambitious brill
 Gild the farthing if you will
 Yet it is a farthing still
 CAPT puzzled Yes I know

 I could talk like that for ever
 Once a cat was killed by care
 Only brave deserve the fair
 Very true
 So they do
 CAPT Wink is often good as nod
 Spoils the child who spares the rod
 Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers
 Dogs are found in many mangers

 feel that
 they are dictated by a sincere regard for me But to what new
 misery is
 she referring Time alone can tell

 Enter SIR JOSEPH

 SIR JOSEPH Captain Corcoran I am much disappointed with your
 daughter In fact I dont think she will do
 CAPT She wont do Sir Joseph
 SIR JOSEPH Im afraid not The fact is that although I have
 urged my
 suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official
 utterance
 I have done so hitherto without success How do you account for
 this
 CAPT Really Sir Joseph I hardly know Josephine is of course
 sensible of your condescension
 SIR JOSEPH She naturally would be
 CAPT But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her
 SIR JOSEPH You think it does
 CAPT I can hardly say but she is a modest girl and her
 social
 position is far below your own It may be that she feels she is
 not
 worthy of you
 SIR JOSEPH That is really a very sensible suggestion and
 displays
 more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for
 CAPT See she comes If your lordship would kindly reason with
 her and
 assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty
 that
 love levels all ranks her respect for an official utterance
 might induce
 her to look upon your offer in its proper light
 SIR JOSEPH It is not unlikely I will adopt your suggestion
 But soft
 she is here Let us withdraw and watch our opportunity

 Enter JOSEPHINE from cabin FIRST LORD and CAPTAIN retire

 SCENEJOSEPHINE

 The hours creep on apace
 My guilty heart is quaking
 Oh that I might retrace
 The step that I am taking
 Its folly it were easy to be showing
 What I am giving up and whither going
 On the one hand papas luxurious home
 Hung with ancestral armour and old brasses
 Carved oak and tapestry from distant Rome
 Rare blue and white Venetian fingerglasses
 Rich oriental rugs luxurious sofa pillows
 And everything that isnt old from Gillows
 And on the other a dark and dingy room
 In some back street with stuffy children crying
 Where organs yell and clacking housewives fume
 And clothes are hanging out all day adrying
 With one cracked lookingglass to see your face
 in
 And dinner served up in a pudding basin

 A simple sailor lowly born
 Unlettered and unknown
 Who toils for bread from early mom
 Till half the night has flown
 No golden rank can he impart
 No wealth of house or land
 No fortune save his trusty heart
 And honest brown right hand
 And yet he is so wondrous fair
 That love for one so passing rare
 So peerless in his manly beauty
 Were little else than solemn duty
 Oh god of love and god of reason say
 Which of you twain shall my poor heart obey

 SIR JOSEPH and CAPTAIN enter

 SIR JOSEPH Madam it has been represented to me that you are
 appalled
 by my exalted rank I desire to convey to you officially my
 assurance
 that if your hesitation is attributable to that circumstance it
 is
 uncalled for
 JOS Oh then your lordship is of opinion that married
 happiness is not
 inconsistent with discrepancy in rank
 SIR JOSEPH I am officially of that opinion
 JOS That the high and the lowly may be truly happy together
 provided
 that they truly love one another
 SIR JOSEPH Madam I desire to convey to you officially my
 opinion that
 love is a platform upon which all ranks meet
 JOS I thank you Sir Joseph I did hesitate but I will
 hesitate no
 longer Aside He little thinks how eloquently he has pleaded
 his
 rivals cause

ACT I


 SCENEAn Arcadian Landscape A river runs around the back of the
 stage A rustic bridge crosses the river

 Enter Fairies led by Leila Celia and Fleta They trip around
 the stage singing as they dance

 CHORUS

 Tripping hither tripping thither
 Nobody knows why or whither
 We must dance and we must sing
 Round about our fairy ring

 SOLOCELIA

 We are dainty little fairies
 Ever singing ever dancing
 We indulge in our vagaries
 In a fashion most entrancing
 If you ask the special function
 Of our neverceasing motion
 We reply without compunction
 That we havent any notion

 CHORUS

 No we havent any notion
 Tripping hither etc

 SOLOLEILA

 If you ask us how we live
 Lovers all essentials give
 We can ride on lovers sighs
 Warm ourselves in lovers eyes
 Bathe ourselves in lovers tears
 Clothe ourselves with lovers fears
 Arm ourselves with lovers darts
 Hide ourselves in lovers hearts
 When you know us youll discover
 That we almost live on lover

 CHORUS

 Yes we live on lover
 Tripping hither etc
 At the end of Chorus all sigh wearily

 CELIA Ah its all very well but since our Queen banished
 Iolanthe fairy revels have not been what they were

 LEILA Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland Why she
 wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances We sing her songs
 and we trip her measures but we dont enjoy ourselves
 FLETA To think that fiveandtwenty years have elapsed since
 she was banished What could she have done to have deserved so
 terrible a punishment
 LEILA Something awful She married a mortal
 FLETA Oh Is it injudicious to marry a mortal
 LEILA Injudicious It strikes at the root of the whole
 fairy system By our laws the fairy who marries a mortal dies
 CELIA But Iolanthe didnt die

 Enter Fairy Queen

 QUEEN No because your Queen who loved her with a
 surpassing love commuted her sentence to penal servitude for life
 on condition that she left her husband and never communicated with
 him again
 LEILA That sentence of penal servitude she is now working
 out on her head at the bottom of that stream
 QUEEN Yes but when I banished her I gave her all the
 pleasant places of the earth to dwell in Im sure I never
 intended that she should go and live at the bottom of a stream It
 makes me perfectly wretched to think of the discomfort she must
 have undergone
 LEILA Think of the damp And her chest was always delicate
 QUEEN And the frogs Ugh I never shall enjoy any peace of
 mind until I know why Iolanthe went to live among the frogs
 FLETA Then why not summon her and ask her
 QUEEN Why Because if I set eyes on her I should forgive
 her at once
 CELIA Then why not forgive her Twentyfive yearsits a
 long time
 LEILA Think how we loved her
 QUEEN Loved her What was your love to mine Why she was
 invaluable to me Who taught me to curl myself inside a buttercup
 Iolanthe Who taught me to swing upon a cobweb Iolanthe Who
 taught me to dive into a dewdropto nestle in a nutshellto
 gambol upon gossamer Iolanthe
 LEILA She certainly did surprising things
 FLETA Oh give her back to us great Queen for your sake if
 not for ours All kneel in supplication
 QUEEN irresolute Oh I should be strong but I am weak
 I should be marble but I am clay Her punishment has been heavier
 than I intended I did not mean that she should live among the
 frogsandwell well it shall be as you wishit shall be as you
 wish

 INVOCATIONQUEEN

 Iolanthe
 From thy dark exile thou art summoned
 Come to our call
 Come come Iolanthe

 CELIA Iolanthe

 LEILA Iolanthe

 ALL Come to our call Iolanthe
 Iolanthe come

 Iolanthe rises from the water She is clad in waterweeds She
 approaches the Queen with head bent and arms crossed

 IOLANTHE With humbled breast
 And every hope laid low
 To thy behest
 Offended Queen I bow

 QUEEN For a dark sin against our fairy laws
 We sent thee into lifelong banishment
 But mercy holds her sway within our hearts
 Risethou art pardoned

 IOL Pardoned

 ALL Pardoned

 Her weeds fall from her and she appears clothed as a fairy The
 Queen places a diamond coronet on her head and embraces her The
 others also embrace her

 CHORUS

 Welcome to our hearts again
 Iolanthe Iolanthe
 We have shared thy bitter pain
 Iolanthe Iolanthe

 Every heart and every hand
 In our loving little band
 Welcomes thee to Fairyland
 Iolanthe

 QUEEN And now tell me with all the world to choose from
 why on earth did you decide to live at the bottom of that stream
 IOL To be near my son Strephon
 QUEEN Bless my heart I didnt know you had a son
 IOL He was born soon after I left my husband by your royal
 commandbut he does not even know of his fathers existence
 FLETA How old is he
 IOL Twentyfour
 LEILA Twentyfour No one to look at you would think you
 had a son of twentyfour But thats one of the advantages of
 being immortal We never grow old Is he pretty
 IOL Hes extremely pretty but hes inclined to be stout
 ALL disappointed Oh
 QUEEN I see no objection to stoutness in moderation
 CELIA And what is he
 IOL Hes an Arcadian shepherdand he loves Phyllis a Ward
 in Chancery
 CELIA A mere shepherd and he half a fairy
 IOL Hes a fairy down to the waistbut his legs are mortal
 ALL Dear me
 QUEEN I have no reason to suppose that I am more curious
 than other people but I confess I should like to see a person who
 is a fairy down to the waist but whose legs are mortal
 IOL Nothing easier for here he comes

 Enter Strephon singing and dancing and playing on a flageolet
 He does not see the Fairies who retire up stage as he enters

 SONGSTREPHON

 Good morrow good mother
 Good mother good morrow
 By some means or other
 Pray banish your sorrow
 With joy beyond telling
 My bosom is swelling
 So join in a measure
 Expressive of pleasure
 For Im to be married todaytoday
 Yes Im to be married today

 CHORUS aside Yes hes to be married todaytoday
 Yes hes to be married today

 IOL Then the Lord Chancellor has at last given his consent
 to your marriage with his beautiful ward Phyllis
 STREPH Not he indeed To all my tearful prayers he answers
 me A shepherd lad is no fit helpmate for a Ward of Chancery I
 stood in court and there I sang him songs of Arcadee with
 flageolet accompanimentin vain At first he seemed amused so
 did the Bar but quickly wearying of my song and pipe bade me get
 out A servile usher then in crumpled bands and rusty bombazine
 led me still singing into Chancery Lane Ill go no more Ill
 marry her today and brave the upshot be it what it may Sees
 Fairies But who are these
 IOL Oh Strephon rejoice with me my Queen has pardoned
 me
 STREPH Pardoned you mother This is good news indeed
 IOL And these ladies are my beloved sisters
 STREPH Your sisters Then they aremy aunts
 QUEEN A pleasant piece of news for your bride on her wedding
 day
 STREPH Hush My bride knows nothing of my fairyhood I
 dare not tell her lest it frighten her She thinks me mortal and
 prefers me so
 LEILA Your fairyhood doesnt seem to have done you much
 good
 STREPH Much good My dear aunt its the curse of my
 existence Whats the use of being half a fairy My body can
 creep through a keyhole but whats the good of that when my legs
 are left kicking behind I can make myself invisible down to the
 waist but thats of no use when my legs remain exposed to view
 My brain is a fairy brain but from the waist downwards Im a
 gibbering idiot My upper half is immortal but my lower half
 grows older every day and some day or other must die of old age
 Whats to become of my upper half when Ive buried my lower half I
 really dont know
 FAIRIES Poor fellow
 QUEEN I see your difficulty but with a fairy brain you
 should seek an intellectual sphere of action Let me see Ive a
 borough or two at my disposal Would you like to go into
 Parliament
 IOL A fairy Member That would be delightful
 STREPH Im afraid I should do no good thereyou see down
 to the waist Im a Tory of the most determined description but my
 legs are a couple of confounded Radicals and on a division
 theyd be sure to take me into the wrong lobby You see theyre
 two to one which is a strong working majority
 QUEEN Dont let that distress you you shall be returned as
 a LiberalConservative and your legs shall be our peculiar care
 STREPH bowing I see your Majesty does not do things by
 halves
 QUEEN No we are fairies down to the feet

 ENSEMBLE

 QUEEN Fare thee well attractive stranger
 FAIRIES Fare thee well attractive stranger
 QUEEN Shouldst thou be in doubt or danger
 Peril or perplexitee
 Call us and well come to thee
 FAIRIES Aye Call us and well come to thee
 Tripping hither tripping thither
 Nobody knows why or whither
 We must now be taking wing
 To another fairy ring

 Fairies and Queen trip off Iolanthe who takes an affectionate
 farewell of her son going off last

 Enter Phyllis singing and dancing and accompanying herself on a
 flageolet

 Some means of concealing

 STREPH embracing her My Phyllis And today we are to be
 made happy for ever
 PHYL Well were to be married
 STREPH Its the same thing
 PHYL I suppose it is But oh Strephon I tremble at the
 step Im taking I believe its penal servitude for life to marry
 a Ward of Court without the Lord Chancellors consent I shall be
 of age in two years Dont you think you could wait two years
 STREPH Two years Have you ever looked in the glass
 PHYL No never
 STREPH Here look at that showing her a pocket mirror and
 tell me if you think it rational to expect me to wait two years
 PHYL looking at herself No Youre quite rightits
 asking too much One must be reasonable
 STREPH Besides who knows what will happen in two years
 Why you might fall in love with the Lord Chancellor himself by
 that time
 PHYL Yes Hes a clean old gentleman
 STREPH As it is half the House of Lords are sighing at your
 feet
 PHYL The House of Lords are certainly extremely attentive
 STREPH Attentive I should think they were Why did
 fiveandtwenty Liberal Peers come down to shoot over your
 grassplot last autumn It couldnt have been the sparrows Why
 did fiveandtwenty Conservative Peers come down to fish your pond
 Dont tell me it was the goldfish No nodelays are dangerous
 and if we are to marry the sooner the better

 SONGLORD CHANCELLOR

 The Law is the true embodiment
 Of everything thats excellent
 It has no kind of fault or flaw
 And I my Lords embody the Law
 The constitutional guardian I
 Of pretty young Wards in Chancery
 All very agreeable girlsand none
 Are over the age of twentyone
 A pleasant occupation for
 A rather susceptible Chancellor

 ALL A pleasant etc

 But though the compliment implied
 Inflates me with legitimate pride
 It nevertheless cant be denied
 That it has its inconvenient side
 For Im not so old and not so plain
 And Im quite prepared to marry again
 But thered be the deuce to pay in the Lords
 If I fell in love with one of my Wards
 Which rather tries my temper for
 Im such a susceptible Chancellor

 ALL Which rather etc

 And every one whod marry a Ward
 Must come to me for my accord
 And in my court I sit all day
 Giving agreeable girls away
 With one for himand one for he
 And one for youand one for ye
 And one for thouand one for thee
 But never oh never a one for me
 Which is exasperating for
 A highly susceptible Chancellor

 ALL Which is etc

 Enter Lord Tolloller

 LORD TOLL And now my Lords to the business of the day
 LORD CH By all means Phyllis who is a Ward of Court has
 so powerfully affected your Lordships that you have appealed to me
 in a body to give her to whichever one of you she may think proper
 to select and a noble Lord has just gone to her cottage to request
 her immediate attendance It would be idle to deny that I myself
 have the misfortune to be singularly attracted by this young
 person My regard for her is rapidly undermining my constitution
 Three months ago I was a stout man I need say no more If I
 could reconcile it with my duty I should unhesitatingly award her
 to myself for I can conscientiously say that I know no man who is
 so well fitted to render her exceptionally happy Peers Hear
 hear But such an award would be open to misconstruction and
 therefore at whatever personal inconvenience I waive my claim
 LORD TOLL My Lord I desire on the part of this House to
 express its sincere sympathy with your Lordships most painful
 position
 LORD CH I thank your Lordships The feelings of a Lord
 Chancellor who is in love with a Ward of Court are not to be
 envied What is his position Can he give his own consent to his
 own marriage with his own Ward Can he marry his own Ward without
 his own consent And if he marries his own Ward without his own
 consent can he commit himself for contempt of his own Court And
 if he commit himself for contempt of his own Court can he appear
 by counsel before himself to move for arrest of his own judgement
 Ah my Lords it is indeed painful to have to sit upon a woolsack
 which is stuffed with such thorns as these

 Enter Lord Mountararat

 LORD MOUNT My Lord I have much pleasure in announcing that
 I have succeeded in inducing the young person to present herself at
 the Bar of this House

 Enter Phyllis

 SOLOLORD MOUNTARARAT

 Though the views of the House have diverged
 On every conceivable motion
 All questions of Party are merged
 In a frenzy of love and devotion
 If you ask us distinctly to say
 What Party we claim to belong to
 We reply without doubt or delay
 The Party Im singing this song to

 SOLOPHYLLIS

 Im very much pained to refuse
 But Ill stick to my pipes and my tabors
 I can spell all the words that I use
 And my grammars as good as my neighbours
 As for birthI was born like the rest
 My behaviour is rustic but hearty
 And I know where to turn for the best
 When I want a particular Party

 PHYLLIS LORD TOLL and LORD MOUNT

 Though her station is none of the best
 I suppose she was born like the rest
 And she knows where to look for her hearty
 When she wants a particular Party

 Nay tempt me not
 To rank Ill not be bound
 In lowly cot
 Alone is virtue found

 CHORUS No no indeed high rank will never hurt you
 The Peerage is not destitute of virtue

 BALLADLORD TOLLOLLER

 Spurn not the nobly born
 With love affected
 Nor treat with virtuous scorn
 The wellconnected
 High rank involves no shame
 We boast an equal claim
 With him of humble name
 To be respected
 Blue blood blue blood
 When virtuous love is sought
 Thy power is naught
 Though dating from the Flood
 Blue blood Ah blue blood

 CHORUS When virtuous love is sought etc

 Spare us the bitter pain
 Of stern denials
 Nor with lowborn disdain
 Augment our trials
 Hearts just as pure and fair
 May beat in Belgrave Square
 As in the lowly air
 Of Seven Dials
 Blue blood blue blood
 Of what avail art thou
 To serve us now
 Though dating from the Flood
 Blue blood Ah blue blood

 CHORUS Of what avail art thou etc

 Exeunt all the Peers marching round stage with much dignity
 Lord Chancellor separates Phyllis from Strephon and orders her off
 She follows Peers Manent Lord Chancellor and Strephon

 LORD CH Now sir what excuse have you to offer for having
 disobeyed an order of the Court of Chancery
 STREPH My Lord I know no Courts of Chancery I go by
 Natures Acts of Parliament The beesthe breezethe seasthe
 rooksthe brooksthe galesthe valesthe fountains and the
 mountains cry You love this maidentake her we command you
 Tis writ in heaven by the bright barbed dart that leaps forth into
 lurid light from each grim thundercloud The very rain pours forth
 her sad and sodden sympathy When chorused Nature bids me take my
 love shall I reply Nay but a certain Chancellor forbids it
 Sir you are Englands Lord High Chancellor but are you Chancellor
 of birds and trees King of the winds and Prince of thunderclouds
 LORD CH No Its a nice point I dont know that I ever
 met it before But my difficulty is that at present theres no
 evidence before the Court that chorused Nature has interested
 herself in the matter
 STREPH No evidence You have my word for it I tell you
 that she bade me take my love
 LORD CH Ah but my good sir you mustnt tell us what she
 told youits not evidence Now an affidavit from a thunderstorm
 or a few words on oath from a heavy shower would meet with all the
 attention they deserve
 STREPH And have you the heart to apply the prosaic rules of
 evidence to a case which bubbles over with poetical emotion
 LORD CH Distinctly I have always kept my duty strictly
 before my eyes and it is to that fact that I owe my advancement to
 my present distinguished position

 SONGLORD CHANCELLOR

 When I went to the Bar as a very young man
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 Ill work on a new and original plan
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 Ill never assume that a rogue or a thief
 Is a gentleman worthy implicit belief
 Because his attorney has sent me a brief
 Said I to myselfsaid I

 Ere I go into court I will read my brief through
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 And Ill never take work Im unable to do
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 My learned profession Ill never disgrace
 By taking a fee with a grin on my face
 When I havent been there to attend to the case
 Said I to myselfsaid I

 Ill never throw dust in a jurymans eyes
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 Or hoodwink a judge who is not overwise
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 Or assume that the witnesses summoned in force
 In Exchequer Queens Bench Common Pleas or Divorce
 Have perjured themselves as a matter of course
 Said I to myselfsaid I

 In other professions in which men engage
 Said I to myself said I
 The Army the Navy the Church and the Stage
 Said I to myselfsaid I
 Professional licence if carried too far
 Your chance of promotion will certainly mar
 And I fancy the rule might apply to the Bar
 Said I to myselfsaid I

 SONGPRIVATE WILLIS

 When all night long a chap remains
 On sentrygo to chase monotony
 He exercises of his brains
 That is assuming that hes got any
 Though never nurtured in the lap
 Of luxury yet I admonish you
 I am an intellectual chap
 And think of things that would astonish you
 I often think its comicalFal lal la
 How Nature always does contriveFal lal la
 That every boy and every gal
 Thats born into the world alive
 Is either a little Liberal
 Or else a little Conservative
 Fal lal la

 When in that House MPs divide
 If theyve a brain and cerebellum too
 Theyve got to leave that brain outside
 And vote just as their leaders tell em to
 But then the prospect of a lot
 Of dull M Ps in close proximity
 All thinking for themselves is what
 No man can face with equanimity
 Then lets rejoice with loud Fal laFal la la
 That Nature always does contriveFal lal la
 That every boy and every gal
 Thats born into the world alive
 Is either a little Liberal
 Or else a little Conservative

 CELIA You seem annoyed
 LORD MOUNT Annoyed I should think so Why this
 ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything
 Tonight is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
 open to Competitive Examination
 LORD TOLL And hell carry it too
 LORD MOUNT Carry it Of course he will Hes a
 Parliamentary Pickfordhe carries everything
 LEILA Yes If you please thats our fault
 LORD MOUNT The deuce it is
 CELIA Yes we influence the members and compel them to vote
 just as he wishes them to
 LEILA Its our system It shortens the debates
 LORD TOLL Well but think what it all means I dont so
 much mind for myself but with a House of Peers with no
 grandfathers worth mentioning the country must go to the dogs
 LEILA I suppose it must
 LORD MOUNT I dont want to say a word against brainsIve
 a great respect for brainsI often wish I had some myselfbut
 with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect
 whats to become of the House of Commons
 LEILA I never thought of that
 LORD MOUNT This comes of women interfering in politics It
 so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
 is not susceptible of any improvement at all it is the House of
 Peers

 SONGLORD MOUNTARARAT

 When Britain really ruled the waves
 In good Queen Besss time
 The House of Peers made no pretence
 To intellectual eminence
 Or scholarship sublime
 Yet Britain won her proudest bays
 In good Queen Besss glorious days

 CHORUS Yes Britain won etc

 When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte
 As every child can tell
 The House of Peers throughout the war
 Did nothing in particular
 And did it very well
 Yet Britain set the world ablaze
 In good King Georges glorious days

 CHORUS Yes Britain set etc

 And while the House of Peers withholds
 Its legislative hand
 And noble statesmen do not itch
 To interfere with matters which
 They do not understand
 As bright will shine Great Britains rays
 As in King Georges glorious days

 CHORUS As bright will shine etc

 LEILA who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
 song Charming persons are they not
 CELIA Distinctly For selfcontained dignity combined with
 airy condescension give me a British Representative Peer

 too late Think of the mischief youre doing

 QUEEN Youre a very fine fellow sir
 WILLIS I am generally admired
 QUEEN I can quite understand it To Fairies Now here is
 a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike That man has
 a most extraordinary effect upon me If I yielded to a natural
 impulse I should fall down and worship that man But I mortify
 this inclination I wrestle with it and it lies beneath my feet
 That is how I treat my regard for that man

 SONGFAIRY QUEEN

 Oh foolish fay
 Think you because
 His brave array
 My bosom thaws
 Id disobey
 Our fairy laws
 Because I fly
 In realms above
 In tendency
 To fall in love
 Resemble I
 The amorous dove
 Aside Oh amorous dove
 Type of Ovidius Naso
 This heart of mine
 Is soft as thine
 Although I dare not say so

 CHORUS Oh amorous dove etc

 On fire that glows
 With heat intense
 I turn the hose
 Of common sense
 And out it goes
 At small expense
 We must maintain
 Our fairy law
 That is the main
 On which to draw
 In that we gain
 A Captain Shaw
 Aside Oh Captain Shaw
 Type of true love kept under
 Could thy Brigade
 With cold cascade
 Quench my great love I wonder

 CHORUS Oh Captain Shaw etc

 Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen sorrowfully

 Enter Phyllis

 PHYL half crying I cant think why Im not in better

 LORD MOUNT So we are At least I am
 LORD TOLL So am I
 LORD MOUNT No no
 LORD TOLL I am indeed Very plain
 LORD MOUNT Well wellperhaps you are
 PHYL Theres really nothing to choose between you If one
 of you would forgo his title and distribute his estates among his
 Irish tenantry why then I should then see a reason for accepting
 the other
 LORD MOUNT Tolloller are you prepared to make this
 sacrifice
 LORD TOLL No
 LORD MOUNT Not even to oblige a lady
 LORD TOLL No not even to oblige a lady
 LORD MOUNT Then the only question is which of us shall
 give way to the other Perhaps on the whole she would be happier
 with me I dont know I may be wrong
 LORD TOLL No I dont know that you are I really believe
 she would But the awkward part of the thing is that if you rob me
 of the girl of my heart we must fight and one of us must die
 Its a family tradition that I have sworn to respect Its a
 painful position for I have a very strong regard for you George
 LORD MOUNT much affected My dear Thomas
 LORD TOLL You are very dear to me George We were boys
 togetherat least I was If I were to survive you my existence
 would be hopelessly embittered
 LORD MOUNT Then my dear Thomas you must not do it I say
 it again and againif it will have this effect upon you you must
 not do it No no If one of us is to destroy the other let it
 be me
 LORD TOLL No no
 LORD MOUNT Ah yesby our boyish friendship I implore you
 LORD TOLL much moved Well well be it so But
 nonoI cannot consent to an act which would crush you with
 unavaillng remorse
 LORD MOUNT But it would not do so I should be very sad at
 firstoh who would not bebut it would wear off I like you
 very muchbut not perhaps as much as you like me
 LORD TOLL George youre a noble fellow but that telltale
 tear betrays you No George you are very fond of me and I
 cannot consent to give you a weeks uneasiness on my account
 LORD MOUNT But dear Thomas it would not last a week
 Remember you lead the House of Lords On your demise I shall take
 your place Oh Thomas it would not last a day

 Love hopeless love my ardent soul encumbers

 And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers

 SONGLORD CHANCELLOR

 When youre lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is
 tabood by anxiety
 I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in
 without impropriety
 For your brain is on firethe bedclothes conspire of usual
 slumber to plunder you
 First your counterpane goes and uncovers your toes and your
 sheet slips demurely from under you
 Then the blanketing ticklesyou feel like mixed picklesso
 terribly sharp is the pricking
 And youre hot and youre cross and you tumble and toss till
 theres nothing twixt you and the ticking
 Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap and you
 pick em all up in a tangle
 Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its
 usual angle
 Well you get some repose in the form of a doze with hot
 eyeballs and head ever aching
 But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that youd
 very much better be waking
 For you dream you are crossing the Channel and tossing about in
 a steamer from Harwich
 Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very
 small secondclass carriage
 And youre giving a treat penny ice and cold meat to a party of
 friends and relations
 Theyre a ravenous hordeand they all came on board at Sloane
 Square and South Kensington Stations
 And bound on that journey you find your attorney who started that
 morning from Devon
 Hes a bit undersized and you dont feel surprised when he tells
 you hes only eleven
 Well youre driving like mad with this singular lad by the by
 the ships now a fourwheeler
 And youre playing round games and he calls you bad names when
 you tell him that ties pay the dealer
 But this you cant stand so you throw up your hand and you find
 youre as cold as an icicle
 In your shirt and your socks the black silk with gold clocks
 crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle
 And he and the crew are on bicycles toowhich theyve somehow or
 other invested in
 And hes telling the tars all the particulars of a company hes
 interested in
 Its a scheme of devices to get at low prices all goods from
 cough mixtures to cables
 Which tickled the sailors by treating retailers as though they
 were all vegetables
 You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman first take
 off his boots with a boottree
 And his legs will take root and his fingers will shoot and
 theyll blossom and bud like a fruittree
 From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea
 cauliflower pineapple and cranberries
 While the pastrycook plant cherry brandy will grant apple puffs
 and three corners and Banburys
 The shares are a penny and ever so many are taken by Rothschild
 and Baring
 And just as a few are allotted to you you awake with a shudder
 despairing
 Youre a regular wreck with a crick in your neck and no wonder
 you snore for your heads on the floor and youve needles and
 pins from your soles to your shins and your flesh is acreep for
 your left legs asleep and youve cramp in your toes and a fly on
 your nose and some fluff in your lung and a feverish tongue and
 a thirst thats intense and a general sense that you havent been
 sleeping in clover
 But the darkness has passed and its daylight at last and the
 night has been longditto ditto my songand thank goodness
 theyre both of them over

 Lord Chancellor falls exhausted on
 a seat

 Enter Lords Mountararat and Tolloller

 LORD MOUNT I am much distressed to see your Lordship in this
 condition
 LORD CH Ah my Lords it is seldom that a Lord Chancellor
 has reason to envy the position of another but I am free to
 confess that I would rather be two Earls engaged to Phyllis than
 any other halfdozen noblemen upon the face of the globe
 LORD TOLL without enthusiasm Yes Its an enviable
 position when youre the only one
 LORD MOUNT Oh yes no doubtmost enviable At the same
 time seeing you thus we naturally say to ourselves This is very
 sad His Lordship is constitutionally as blithe as a birdhe
 trills upon the bench like a thing of song and gladness His
 series of judgements in F sharp minor given andante in sixeight
 time are among the most remarkable effects ever produced in a
 Court of Chancery He is perhaps the only living instance of a
 judge whose decrees have received the honour of a double encore
 How can we bring ourselves to do that which will deprive the Court
 of Chancery of one of its most attractive features
 LORD CH I feel the force of your remarks but I am here in
 two capacities and they clash my Lords they clash I deeply
 grieve to say that in declining to entertain my last application to
 myself I presumed to address myself in terms which render it
 impossible for me ever to apply to myself again It was a most
 painful scene my Lordsmost painful
 LORD TOLL This is what it is to have two capacities Let us
 be thankful that we are persons of no capacity whatever
 LORD MOUNT Come come Remember you are a very just and
 kindly old gentleman and you need have no hesitation in
 approaching yourself so that you do so respectfully and with a
 proper show of deference
 LORD CH Do you really think so
 LORD MOUNT I do
 LORD CH Well I will nerve myself to another effort and
 if that fails I resign myself to my fate

 Much Id spend
 To gain my end

 Crime is no exotic
 Bitter is your bane
 Terrible your trials
 Dingy Drury Lane
 Soapless Seven Dials
 Take a tipsy lout
 Gathered from the gutter
 Hustle him about
 Strap him to a shutter
 What am I but he
 Washed at hours stated
 Fed on filagree
 Clothed and educated
 Hes a mark of scorn
 I might be another
 If I had been born
 Of a tipsy mother
 Take a wretched thief
 Through the city sneaking
 Pocket handkerchief
 Ever ever seeking
 What is he but I
 Robbed of all my chances
 Picking pockets by
 force of circumstances
 I might be as bad
 As unlucky rather
 If Id only had
 Fagin for a father

 Enter Lord Chancellor

 LORD CH Victory Victory Success has crowned my efforts
 and I may consider myself engaged to Phyllis At first I wouldnt
 hear of itit was out of the question But I took heart I
 pointed out to myself that I was no stranger to myself that in
 point of fact I had been personally acquainted with myself for
 some years This had its effect I admitted that I had watched my
 professional advancement with considerable interest and I
 handsomely added that I yielded to no one in admiration for my
 private and professional virtues This was a great point gained
 I then endeavoured to work upon my feelings Conceive my joy when
 I distinctly perceived a tear glistening in my own eye
 Eventually after a severe struggle with myself I
 reluctantlymost reluctantlyconsented

 Iolanthe comes down
 veiled

 RECITATIVEIOLANTHE kneeling

 My lord a suppliant at your feet I kneel
 Oh listen to a mothers fond appeal
 Hear me tonight I come in urgent need
 Tis for my son young Strephon that I plead

 BALLADIOLANTHE

 He loves If in the bygone years
 Thine eyes have ever shed
 Tearsbitter unavailing tears
 For one untimely dead
 If in the eventide of life
 Sad thoughts of her arise
 Then let the memory of thy wife
 Plead for my boyhe dies

 He dies If fondly laid aside
 In some old cabinet
 Memorials of thy longdead bride
 Lie dearly treasured yet
 Then let her hallowed bridal dress
 Her little dainty gloves
 Her withered flowersher faded tress
 Plead for my boyhe loves

 The Lord Chancellor is moved by this appeal After a pause

 LORD CH It may not befor so the fates decide
 Learn thou that Phyllis is my promised bride
 IOL in horror Thy bride No no
 LORD CH It shall be so
 Those who would separate us woe betide

 IOL My doom thy lips have spoken
 I plead in vain

ACT I

 SCENECourtyard of KoKos Palace in Titipu Japanese nobles
 discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by
 native drawings

 CHORUS OF NOBLES

 If you want to know who we are
 We are gentlemen of Japan
 On many a vase and jar
 On many a screen and fan
 We figure in lively paint
 Our attitudes queer and quaint
 Youre wrong if you think it aint oh

 If you think we are worked by strings
 Like a Japanese marionette
 You dont understand these things
 It is simply Court etiquette
 Perhaps you suppose this throng
 Cant keep it up all day long
 If thats your idea youre wrong oh

 Enter NankiPoo in great excitement He carries a native guitar
 on his back and a bundle of ballads in his hand

 RECITNANKIPOO

 Gentlemen I pray you tell me
 Where a gentle maiden dwelleth
 Named YumYum the ward of KoKo
 In pity speak oh speak I pray you

 A NOBLE Why who are you who ask this question
 NANK Come gather round me and Ill tell you

 SONG and CHORUSNANKIPOO

 A wandering minstrel I
 A thing of shreds and patches
 Of ballads songs and snatches
 And dreamy lullaby

 My catalogue is long
 Through every passion ranging
 And to your humours changing
 I tune my supple song

 Are you in sentimental mood
 Ill sigh with you
 Oh sorrow sorrow
 On maidens coldness do you brood
 Ill do so too
 Oh sorrow sorrow
 Ill charm your willing ears
 With songs of lovers fears
 While sympathetic tears
 My cheeks bedew
 Oh sorrow sorrow

 But if patriotic sentiment is wanted
 Ive patriotic ballads cut and dried
 For whereer our countrys banner may be planted
 All other local banners are defied
 Our warriors in serried ranks assembled
 Never quailor they conceal it if they do
 And I shouldnt be surprised if nations trembled
 Before the mighty troops of Titipu

 CHORUS We shouldnt be surprised etc

 NANK And if you call for a song of the sea
 Well heave the capstan round
 With a yeo heave ho for the wind is free
 Her anchors atrip and her helms alee
 Hurrah for the homeward bound

 CHORUS Yeohoheave ho
 Hurrah for the homeward bound

 To lay aloft in a howling breeze
 May tickle a landsmans taste
 But the happiest hour a sailor sees
 Is when hes down
 At an inland town
 With his Nancy on his knees yeo ho
 And his arm around her waist

 CHORUS Then man the capstanoff we go
 As the fiddler swings us round
 With a yeo heave ho
 And a rum below
 Hurrah for the homeward bound

 A wandering minstrel I etc

 Enter PishTush

 PISH And what may be your business with YumYum
 NANK Ill tell you A year ago I was a member of the
 Titipu town band It was my duty to take the cap round for
 contributions While discharging this delicate office I saw
 YumYum We loved each other at once but she was betrothed to
 her guardian KoKo a cheap tailor and I saw that my suit was
 hopeless Overwhelmed with despair I quitted the town Judge
 of my delight when I heard a month ago that KoKo had been con
 demned to death for flirting I hurried back at once in the
 hope of finding YumYum at liberty to listen to my protestations
 PISH It is true that KoKo was condemned to death for
 flirting but he was reprieved at the last moment and raised to
 the exalted rank of Lord High Executioner under the following
 remarkable circumstances

 SONGPISHTUSH and CHORUS

 Our great Mikado virtuous man
 When he to rule our land began
 Resolved to try
 A plan whereby
 Young men might best be steadied

 So he decreed in words succinct
 That all who flirted leered or winked
 Unless connubially linked
 Should forthwith be beheaded

 And I expect youll all agree
 That he was right to so decree
 And I am right
 And you are right
 And all is right as right can be

 CHORUS And you are right
 And we are right etc

 This stem decree youll understand
 Caused great dismay throughout the land
 For young and old
 And shy and bold
 Were equally affected
 The youth who winked a roving eye
 Or breathed a nonconnubial sigh
 Was thereupon condemned to die
 He usually objected

 And youll allow as I expect
 That he was right to so object
 And I am right
 And you are right
 And everything is quite correct

 CHORUS And you are right
 And we are right etc

 And so we straight let out on bail
 A convict from the county jail
 Whose head was next
 On some pretext
 Condemned to be mown off
 And made him Headsman for we said
 Whos next to be decapited
 Cannot cut off anothers head
 Until hes cut his own off

 And we are right I think youll say
 To argue in this kind of way
 And I am right
 And you are right
 And all is righttooloorallay

 CHORUS And you are right
 And we are right etc

 Exeunt
 Chorus

 Enter PoohBah

 NANK KoKo the cheap tailor Lord High Executioner of
 Titipu Why thats the highest rank a citizen can attain
 POOH It is Our logical Mikado seeing no moral
 difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
 die and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence
 has rolled the two offices into one and every judge is now his
 own executioner
 NANK But how good of you for I see that you are a
 nobleman of the highest rank to condescend to tell all this to
 me a mere strolling minstrel
 POOH Dont mention it I am in point of fact a
 particularly haughty and exclusive person of preAdamite
 ancestral descent You will understand this when I tell you that
 I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic
 globule Consequently my family pride is something
 inconceivable I cant help it I was born sneering But I
 struggle hard to overcome this defect I mortify my pride
 continually When all the great officers of State resigned in a
 body because they were too proud to serve under an extailor did
 I not unhesitatingly accept all their posts at once
 PISH And the salaries attached to them You did
 POOH It is consequently my degrading duty to serve this
 upstart as First Lord of the Treasury Lord Chief Justice
 CommanderinChief Lord High Admiral Master of the Buckhounds
 Groom of the Back Stairs Archbishop of Titipu and Lord Mayor
 both acting and elect all rolled into one And at a salary A
 PoohBah paid for his services I a salaried minion But I do
 it It revolts me but I do it
 NANK And it does you credit
 POOH But I dont stop at that I go and dine with
 middleclass people on reasonable terms I dance at cheap
 suburban parties for a moderate fee I accept refreshment at any
 hands however lowly I also retail State secrets at a very low
 figure For instance any further information about YumYum
 would come under the head of a State secret NankiPoo takes his
 hint and gives him money Aside Another insult and I
 think a light one

 SONGPOOHBAH with NANKIPOO and PISHTUSH

 Young man despair
 Likewise go to
 YumYum the fair
 You must not woo
 It will not do
 Im sorry for you
 You very imperfect ablutioner
 This very day
 From school YumYum
 Will wend her way
 And homeward come
 With beat of drum
 And a rumtumtum
 To wed the Lord High executioner
 And the brass will crash
 And the trumpets bray
 And theyll cut a dash
 On their wedding day
 Shell toddle away as all aver
 With the Lord High Executioner 

 NANK and POOH And the brass will crash etc

 Its a hopeless case
 As you may see
 And in your place
 Away Id flee
 But dont blame me
 Im sorry to be
 Of your pleasure a diminutioner
 Theyll vow their pact
 Extremely soon
 In point of fact
 This afternoon
 Her honeymoon
 With that buffoon
 At seven commences so you shun her

 ALL And the brass will crash etc
 Exit
 PishTush

 RECITNANKIPOO and POOHBAH

 NANK And I have journeyed for a month or nearly
 To learn that YumYum whom I love so dearly
 This day to KoKo is to be united
 POOH The fact appears to be as youve recited
 But here he comes equipped as suits his station
 Hell give you any further information
 Exeunt PoohBah and
 NankiPoo

 SOLOKOKO

 Taken from the county jail
 By a set of curious chances
 Liberated then on bail
 On my own recognizances
 Wafted by a favouring gale
 As one sometimes is in trances
 To a height that few can scale
 Save by long and weary dances
 Surely never had a male
 Under such like circumstances
 So adventurous a tale
 Which may rank with most romances

 CHORUS Defer defer
 To the Lord High Executioner etc

 KO Gentlemen Im much touched by this reception I can
 only trust that by strict attention to duty I shall ensure a
 continuance of those favours which it will ever be my study to
 deserve If I should ever be called upon to act professionally
 I am happy to think that there will be no difficulty in finding
 plenty of people whose loss will be a distinct gain to society at
 large

 SONGKOKO with CHORUS OF MEN

 As some day it may happen that a victim must be found
 Ive got a little listIve got a little list
 Of society offenders who might well be underground
 And who never would be missedwho never would be missed
 Theres the pestilential nuisances who write for autographs
 All people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs
 All children who are up in dates and floor you with em flat
 All persons who in shaking hands shake hands with you like

 CHORUS Hes got em on the listhes got em on the list

 Theres the banjo serenader and the others of his race
 And the pianoorganistIve got him on the list
 And the people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face
 They never would be missedthey never would be missed
 Then the idiot who praises with enthusiastic tone
 All centuries but this and every country but his own
 And the lady from the provinces who dresses like a guy
 And who doesnt think she waltzes but would rather like to
 try
 And that singular anomaly the lady novelist
 I dont think shed be missedIm sure shed not he missed

 CHORUS Hes got her on the listhes got her on the list

 And that Nisi Prius nuisance who just now is rather rife

 And apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind
 Such asWhat dye call himThingembob and

 Enter PoohBah

 KO PoohBah it seems that the festivities in connection
 with my approaching marriage must last a week I should like to
 do it handsomely and I want to consult you as to the amount I
 ought to spend upon them
 POOH Certainly In which of my capacities As First Lord
 of the Treasury Lord Chamberlain Attorney General Chancellor
 of the Exchequer Privy Purse or Private Secretary
 KO Suppose we say as Private Secretary
 POOH Speaking as your Private Secretary I should say
 that as the city will have to pay for it dont stint yourself
 do it well
 KO Exactlyas the city will have to pay for it That is
 your advice
 POOH As Private Secretary Of course you will understand
 that as Chancellor of the Exchequer I am bound to see that due
 economy is observed
 KO Oh But you said just now Dont stint yourself do it
 well
 POOH As Private Secretary
 KO And now you say that due economy must be observed
 POOH As Chancellor of the Exchequer
 KO I see Come over here where the Chancellor cant hear
 us They cross the stage Now as my Solicitor how do you
 advise me to deal with this difficulty
 POOH Oh as your Solicitor I should have no hesitation in
 saying Chance it
 KO Thank you Shaking his hand I will
 POOH If it were not that as Lord Chief Justice I am
 bound to see that the law isnt violated
 KO I see Come over here where the Chief Justice cant
 hear us They cross the stage Now then as First Lord of
 the Treasury
 POOH Of course as First Lord of the Treasury I could
 propose a special vote that would cover all expenses if it were
 not that as Leader of the Opposition it would be my duty to
 resist it tooth and nail Or as Paymaster General I could so
 cook the accounts that as Lord High Auditor I should never
 discover the fraud But then as Archbishop of Titipu it would
 be my duty to denounce my dishonesty and give myself into my own
 custody as first Commissioner of Police
 KO Thats extremely awkward
 POOH I dont say that all these distinguished people
 couldnt be squared but it is right to tell you that they
 wouldnt be sufficiently degraded in their own estimation unless
 they were insulted with a very considerable bribe
 KO The matter shall have my careful consideration But my
 bride and her sisters approach and any little compliment on your
 part such as an abject grovel in a characteristic Japanese
 attitude would be esteemed a favour
 POOH No money no grovel

 Enter NankiPoo

 NANK YumYum at last we are alone I have sought you
 night and day for three weeks in the belief that your guardian
 was beheaded and I find that you are about to be married to him
 this afternoon
 YUM Alas yes
 NANK But you do not love him
 YUM Alas no
 NANK Modified rapture But why do you not refuse him
 YUM What good would that do Hes my guardian and he
 wouldnt let me marry you
 NANK But I would wait until you were of age
 YUM You forget that in Japan girls do not arrive at years
 of discretion until they are fifty
 NANK True from seventeen to fortynine are considered
 years of indiscretion
 YUM Besidesa wandering minstrel who plays a wind
 instrument outside teahouses is hardly a fitting husband for
 the ward of a Lord High Executioner
 NANK But Aside Shall I tell her Yes She will
 not betray me Aloud What if it should prove that after
 all I am no musician
 YUM There I was certain of it directly I heard you
 play
 NANK What if it should prove that I am no other than the
 son of his Majesty the Mikado
 YUM The son of the Mikado But why is your Highness
 disguised And what has your Highness done And will your
 Highness promise never to do it again
 NANK Some years ago I had the misfortune to captivate
 Katisha an elderly lady of my fathers Court She misconstrued
 my customary affability into expressions of affection and
 claimed me in marriage under my fathers law My father the
 Lucius Junius Brutus of his race ordered me to marry her within
 a week or perish ignominiously on the scaffold That night I
 fled his Court and assuming the disguise of a Second Trombone
 I joined the band in which you found me when I had the happiness
 of seeing you Approaching her
 YUM retreating If you please I think your Highness
 had better not come too near The laws against flirting are
 excessively severe
 NANK But we are quite alone and nobody can see us
 YUM Still that dont make it right To flirt is capital
 NANK It is capital
 YUM And we must obey the law
 NANK Deuce take the law
 YUM I wish it would but it wont
 NANK If it were not for that how happy we might be
 YUM Happy indeed
 NANK If it were not for the law we should now be sitting
 side by side like that Sits by her
 YUM Instead of being obliged to sit half a mile off like
 that Crosses and sits at other side of stage
 NANK We should be gazing into each others eyes like
 that Gazing at her sentimentally
 YUM Breathing sighs of unutterable lovelike that
 Sighing and gazing lovingly at him
 NANK With our arms round each others waists like that
 Embracing her
 YUM Yes if it wasnt for the law
 NANK If it wasnt for the law
 YUM As it is of course we couldnt do anything of the
 kind
 NANK Not for worlds
 YUM Being engaged to KoKo you know
 NANK Being engaged to KoKo

 DUETYUMYUM and NANKIPOO

 NANK Were you not to KoKo plighted
 I would say in tender tone
 Loved one let us be united
 Let us be each others own
 I would merge all rank and station
 Worldly sneers are nought to us
 And to mark my admiration
 I would kiss you fondly thus Kisses her
 BOTH IHe would kiss youme fondly thus Kiss
 YUM But as Im engaged to KoKo
 To embrace you thus con fuoco
 Would distinctly be no giuoco
 And for yam I should get toko

 BOTH Toko toko toko toko

 NANK So In spite of all temptation
 Such a theme Ill not discuss
 And on no consideration
 Will I kiss you fondly thus Kissing her
 Let me make it clear to you
 This is what Ill never do
 This oh this oh this oh thisKissing

 KO looking after YumYum There she goes To think how
 entirely my future happiness is wrapped up in that little parcel
 Really it hardly seems worth while Oh matrimony Enter
 PoohBah and PishTush Now then what is it Cant you see Im
 soliloquizing You have interrupted an apostrophe sir
 PISH I am the bearer of a letter from his Majesty the
 Mikado
 KO taking it from him reverentially A letter from the
 Mikado What in the world can he have to say to me Reads
 letter Ah here it is at last I thought it would come sooner
 or later The Mikado is struck by the fact that no executions
 have taken place in Titipu for a year and decrees that unless
 somebody is beheaded within one month the post of Lord High
 Executioner shall be abolished and the city reduced to the rank
 of a village
 PISH But that will involve us all in irretrievable ruin
 KO Yes There is no help for it I shall have to execute
 somebody at once The only question is who shall it be
 POOH Well it seems unkind to say so but as youre
 already under sentence of death for flirting everything seems to
 point to you
 KO To me What are you talking about I cant execute
 myself
 POOH Why not
 KO Why not Because in the first place self
 decapitation is an extremely difficult not to say dangerous
 thing to attempt and in the second its suicide and suicide
 is a capital offence
 POOH That is so no doubt
 PISH We might reserve that point
 POOH True it could be argued six months hence before the
 full Court
 KO Besides I dont see how a man can cut off his own
 head
 POOH A man might try
 PISH Even if you only succeeded in cutting it half off
 that would be something
 POOH It would be taken as an earnest of your desire to
 comply with the Imperial will
 KO No Pardon me but there I am adamant As official
 Headsman my reputation is at stake and I cant consent to
 embark on a professional operation unless I see my way to a
 successful result
 POOH This professional conscientiousness is highly
 creditable to you but it places us in a very awkward position
 KO My good sir the awkwardness of your position is grace
 itself compared with that of a man engaged in the act of cutting
 off his own head
 PISH I am afraid that unless you can obtain a substitute
 
 KO A substitute Oh certainlynothing easier To
 PoohBah PoohBah I appoint you Lord High Substitute
 POOH I should be delighted Such an appointment would
 realize my fondest dreams But no at any sacrifice I must set
 bounds to my insatiable ambition

 The benefit To quit this sphere The fatal

 couple of years I might contrive to forget her

 SONGYUMYUM

 The sun whose rays
 Are all ablaze
 With everliving glory
 Does not deny
 His majesty
 He scorns to tell a story
 He dont exclaim
 I blush for shame
 So kindly be indulgent
 But fierce and bold
 In fiery gold
 He glories effulgent

 I mean to rule the earth
 As he the sky
 We really know our worth
 The sun and I

 Observe his flame
 That placid dame
 The moons Celestial Highness
 Theres not a trace
 Upon her face
 Of diffidence or shyness
 She borrows light
 That through the night
 Mankind may all acclaim her
 And truth to tell
 She lights up well
 So I for one dont blame her

 Ah pray make no mistake
 We are not shy
 Were very wide awake
 The moon and I

 Little need for woeful weeping

 DUETMIKADO and KATISHA

 MIK From every kind of man
 Obedience I expect
 Im the Emperor of Japan

 KAT And Im his daughterinlaw elect
 Hell marry his son
 Hes only got one
 To his daughterinlaw elect

 MIK My morals have been declared
 Particularly correct

 KAT But theyre nothing at all compared
 With those of his daughterinlaw elect
 BowBow
 To his daughterinlaw elect

 ALL BowBow
 To his daughterinlaw elect

 MIK In a fatherly kind of way
 I govern each tribe and sect
 All cheerfully own my sway

 KAT Except his daughterinlaw elect
 As tough as a bone
 With a will of her own
 Is his daughterinlaw elect

 MIK My nature is love and light
 My freedom from all defect

 KAT Is insignificant quite
 Compared with his daughterinlaw elect
 BowBow

 ALL BowBow

 SONGMIKADO and CHORUS

 A more humane Mikado never
 Did in Japan exist
 To nobody second
 Im certainly reckoned
 A true philanthropist
 It is my very humane endeavour
 To make to some extent
 Each evil liver
 A running river
 Of harmless merriment

 My object all sublime
 I shall achieve in time
 To let the punishment fit the crime
 The punishment fit the crime
 And make each prisoner pent
 Unwillingly represent
 A source of innocent merriment
 Of innocent merriment

 All prosy dull society sinners
 Who chatter and bleat and bore
 Are sent to hear sermons
 From mystical Germans
 Who preach from ten till four
 The amateur tenor whose vocal villainies
 All desire to shirk
 Shall during offhours
 Exhibit his powers
 To Madame Tussauds waxwork

 The lady who dyes a chemical yellow
 Or stains her grey hair puce
 Or pinches her figure
 Is painted with vigour
 With permanent walnut juice
 The idiot who in railway carriages
 Scribbles on windowpanes
 We only suffer
 To ride on a buffer
 In Parliamentary trains

 My object all sublime etc

 CHORUS His object all sublime etc

 The advertising quack who wearies
 With tales of countless cures
 His teeth Ive enacted
 Shall all be extracted
 By terrified amateurs
 The musichall singer attends a series
 Of masses and fugues and ops
 By Bach interwoven
 With Spohr and Beethoven
 At classical Monday Pops

 The billiard sharp who any one catches
 His dooms extremely hard
 Hes made to dwell
 In a dungeon cell
 On a spot thats always barred
 And there he plays extravagant matches
 In fitless fingerstalls
 On a cloth untrue
 With a twisted cue
 And elliptical billiard balls

 My object all sublime etc

 CHORUS His object all sublime etc

 Enter PoohBah KoKo and PittiSing All kneel

 PoohBah hands a paper to KoKo

 KO I am honoured in being permitted to welcome your
 Majesty I guess the object of your Majestys visityour wishes
 have been attended to The execution has taken place
 MIK Oh youve had an execution have you
 KO Yes The Coroner has just handed me his certificate
 POOH I am the Coroner KoKo hands certificate to

 MIK And this is the certificate of his death Reads
 At Titipu in the presence of the Lord Chancellor Lord Chief
 Justice AttorneyGeneral Secretary of State for the Home
 Department Lord Mayor and Groom of the Second Floor Front
 POOH They were all present your Majesty I counted them

 MIK Very good house I wish Id been in time for the

 KO A tough fellow he was tooa man of gigantic strength
 His struggles were terrific It was a remarkable scene
 MIK Describe it

 TRIO and CHORUS

 KOKO PITTISING POOHBAH and CHORUS

 KO The criminal cried as he dropped him down
 In a state of wild alarm
 With a frightful frantic fearful frown
 I bared my big right arm
 I seized him by his little pigtail
 And on his knees fell he
 As he squirmed and struggled
 And gurgled and guggled
 I drew my snickersnee
 Oh never shall I
 Forget the cry
 Or the shriek that shrieked he
 As I gnashed my teeth
 When from its sheath
 I drew my snickersnee

 CHORUS

 We know him well
 He cannot tell
 Untrue or groundless tales
 He always tries
 To utter lies
 And every time he fails

 PITTI He shivered and shook as he gave the sign
 For the stroke he didnt deserve
 When all of a sudden his eye met mine
 And it seemed to brace his nerve
 For he nodded his head and kissed his hand
 And he whistled an air did he
 As the sabre true
 Cut cleanly through
 His cervical vertebrae

 When a mans afraid
 A beautiful maid
 Is a cheering sight to see
 And its oh Im glad
 That moment sad
 Was soothed by sight of me

 CHORUS

 Her terrible tale
 You cant assail
 With truth it quite agrees
 Her taste exact
 For faultless fact
 Amounts to a disease

 POOH Now though youd have said that head was dead
 For its owner dead was he
 It stood on its neck with a smile wellbred
 And bowed three times to me
 It was none of your impudent offhand nods
 But as humble as could be
 For it clearly knew
 The deference due
 To a man of pedigree
 And its oh I vow
 This deathly bow
 Was a touching sight to see
 Though trunkless yet
 It couldnt forget
 The deference due to me

 CHORUS

 This haughty youth
 He speaks the truth
 Whenever he finds it pays
 And in this case
 It all took place
 Exactly as he says
 Exeunt
 Chorus

 MIK All this is very interesting and I should like to
 have seen it But we came about a totally different matter A
 year ago my son the heir to the throne of Japan bolted from our
 Imperial Court
 KO Indeed Had he any reason to be dissatisfied with his
 position
 KAT None whatever On the contrary I was going to marry
 himyet he fled
 POOH I am surprised that he should have fled from one so
 lovely
 KAT Thats not true
 POOH No
 KAT You hold that I am not beautiful because my face is
 plain But you know nothing you are still unenlightened
 Learn then that it is not in the face alone that beauty is to
 be sought My face is unattractive
 POOH It is
 KAT But I have a left shoulderblade that is a miracle of
 loveliness People come miles to see it My right elbow has a
 fascination that few can resist
 POOH Allow me
 KAT It is on view Tuesdays and Fridays on presentation of
 visiting card As for my circulation it is the largest in the
 world
 KO And yet he fled
 MIK And is now masquerading in this town disguised as a
 Second Trombone
 KO POOH and PITTI A Second Trombone
 MIK Yes would it be troubling you too much if I asked you
 to produce him He goes by the name of
 KAT NankiPoo
 MIK NankiPoo
 KO Its quite easy That is its rather difficult In
 point of fact hes gone abroad
 MIK Gone abroad His address
 KO Knightsbridge
 KAT who is reading certificate of death Ha
 MIK Whats the matter

 Oh where shall I find another Where shall I find another

 KoKo PoohBah and PittiSing fall on

 MIK looking at paper Dear dear dear this is very
 tiresome To KoKo My poor fellow in your anxiety to carry
 out my wishes you have beheaded the heir to the throne of Japan
 KO I beg to offer an unqualified apology
 POOH I desire to associate myself with that expression of
 regret
 PITTI We really hadnt the least notion
 MIK Of course you hadnt How could you Come come my
 good fellow dont distress yourselfit was no fault of yours
 If a man of exalted rank chooses to disguise himself as a Second
 Trombone he must take the consequences It really distresses me
 to see you take on so Ive no doubt he thoroughly deserved all
 he got They rise
 KO We are infinitely obliged to your Majesty
 PITTI Much obliged your Majesty
 POOH Very much obliged your Majesty
 MIK Obliged not a bit Dont mention it How could you
 tell
 POOH No of course we couldnt tell who the gentleman
 really was
 PITTI It wasnt written on his forehead you know
 KO It might have been on his pockethandkerchief but
 Japanese dont use pockethandkerchiefs Ha ha ha
 MIK Ha ha ha To Katisha I forget the punishment for
 compassing the death of the Heir Apparent
 KO POOH and PITTI Punishment They drop down on their
 knees again
 MIK Yes Something lingering with boiling oil in it I
 fancy Something of that sort I think boiling oil occurs in
 it but Im not sure I know its something humorous but
 lingering with either boiling oil or melted lead Come come
 dont fretIm not a bit angry
 KO in abject terror If your Majesty will accept our
 assurance we had no idea
 MIK Of course
 PITTI I knew nothing about it
 POOH I wasnt there
 MIK Thats the pathetic part of it Unfortunately the
 fool of an Act says compassing the death of the Heir Apparent
 Theres not a word about a mistake
 KO PITTI and POOH No
 MIK Or not knowing
 KO No
 MIK Or having no notion
 PITTI No
 MIK Or not being there
 POOH No
 MIK There should be of course
 KO PITTI and POOH Yes
 MIK But there isnt

 loved you with a whitehot passion that is slowly but surely
 consuming my very vitals Ah shrink not from me If there is
 aught of womans mercy in your heart turn not away from a
 lovesick suppliant whose every fibre thrills at your tiniest
 touch True it is that under a poor mask of disgust I have
 endeavoured to conceal a passion whose inner fires are broiling
 the soul within me But the fire will not be smotheredit
 defies all attempts at extinction and breaking forth all the
 more eagerly for its long restraint it declares itself in words
 that will not be weighedthat cannot be schooledthat should
 not be too severely criticised Katisha I dare not hope for
 your lovebut I will not live without it Darling
 KAT You whose hands still reek with the blood of my
 betrothed dare to address words of passion to the woman you have
 so foully wronged

 SONGKOKO

 On a tree by a river a little tomtit
 Sang Willow titwillow titwillow
 And I said to him Dickybird why do you sit
 Singing Willow titwillow titwillow
 Is it weakness of intellect birdie I cried
 Or a rather tough worm in your little inside
 With a shake of his poor little head he replied
 Oh willow titwillow titwillow

 He slapped at his chest as he sat on that bough
 Singing Willow titwillow titwillow
 And a cold perspiration bespangled his brow
 Oh willow titwillow titwillow
 He sobbed and he sighed and a gurgle he gave
 Then he plunged himself into the billowy wave
 And an echo arose from the suicides grave
 Oh willow titwillow titwillow

 Now I feel just as sure as Im sure that my name
 Isnt Willow titwillow titwillow
 That twas blighted affection that made him exclaim
 Oh willow titwillow titwillow
 And if you remain callous and obdurate I
 Shall perish as he did and you will know why
 Though I probably shall not exclaim as I die
 Oh willow titwillow titwillow

 During this song Katisha has been greatly affected and at the
 end is almost in tears

 KAT whimpering Did he really die of love
 KO He really did
 KAT All on account of a cruel little hen
 KO Yes
 KAT Poor little chap

 bloodthirstiness
 KAT My idea exactly

 DUETKATISHA and KOKO

 KAT There is beauty in the bellow of the blast
 There is grandeur in the growling of the gale
 There is eloquent outpouring
 When the lion is aroaring
 And the tiger is alashing of his tail
 KO Yes I like to see a tiger
 From the Congo or the Niger
 And especially when lashing of his tail
 KAT Volcanoes have a splendor that is grim
 And earthquakes only terrify the dolts
 But to him whos scientific
 Theres nothing thats terrific
 In the falling of a flight of thunderbolts
 KO Yes in spite of all my meekness
 If I have a little weakness
 Its a passion for a flight of thunderbolts

 BOTH If that is so
 Sing derry down derry

 Information Im requesting
 On a subject interesting
 Is a maiden all the better when shes tough
 KAT Throughout this wide dominion
 Its the general opinion
 That shell last a good deal longer when shes
 tough

 KO Are you old enough to marry do you think
 Wont you wait till you are eighty in the shade
 Theres a fascination frantic
 In a ruin thats romantic
 Do you think you are sufficiently decayed
 KAT To the matter that you mention
 I have given some attention
 And I think I am sufficiently decayed

ACT I

 SceneA rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall In the
 distance is a calm sea on which a schooner is lying at anchor
 Rock L sloping down to LC of stage Under these rocks is a
 cavern the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L A
 natural arch of rock occupies the RC of the stage As the
 curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered  some drinking
 some playing cards SAMUEL the Pirate Lieutenant is going from
 one group to another filling the cups from a flask FREDERIC is
 seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene RUTH
 kneels at his feet

 OPENING CHORUS

 ALL Pour O pour the pirate sherry
 Fill O fill the pirate glass
 And to make us more than merry
 Let the pirate bumper pass

 SAMUEL For today our pirate prentice
 Rises from indentures freed
 Strong his arm and keen his scent is
 Hes a pirate now indeed

 ALL Heres good luck to Fredrics ventures
 Fredrics out of his indentures

 SAMUEL Two and twenty now hes rising
 And alone hes fit to fly
 Which were bent on signalizing
 With unusual revelry

 ALL Heres good luck to Fredrics ventures
 Fredrics out of his indentures
 Pour O pour the pirate sherry
 Fill O fill the pirate glass
 And to make us more than merry
 Let the pirate bumper pass

 FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING who enters

 KING Yes Frederic from today you rank as a fullblown
 member of our band
 ALL Hurrah
 FREDERIC My friends I thank you all from my heart for your
 kindly wishes Would that I could repay them as they
 deserve
 KING What do you mean
 FREDERIC Today I am out of my indentures and today I leave
 you for ever
 KING But this is quite unaccountable a keener hand at
 scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never
 shipped a handspike
 FREDERIC Yes I have done my best for you And why It was my
 duty under my indentures and I am the slave of duty
 As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band
 It was through an error  no matter the mistake was
 ours not yours and I was in honour bound by it
 SAMUEL An error What error RUTH rises and comes forward
 FREDERIC I may not tell you it would reflect upon my wellloved
 Ruth
 RUTH Nay dear master my mind has long been gnawed by the
 cankering tooth of mystery Better have it out at
 once

 SONG  RUTH

 RUTH When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
 daring
 His father thought hed prentice him to some career
 seafaring
 I was alas his nursrymaid and so it fell to my lot
 To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
 pilot 
 A life not bad for a hardy lad though surely not a
 high lot
 Though Im a nurse you might do worse than make your
 boy a pilot
 I was a stupid nursrymaid on breakers always
 steering
 And I did not catch the word aright through being hard
 of hearing
 Mistaking my instructions which within my brain did
 gyrate
 I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a
 pirate
 A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile
 lot
 I bound him to a pirate  you  instead of to a
 pilot
 I soon found out beyond all doubt the scope of this
 disaster
 But I hadnt the face to return to my place and break
 it to my master
 A nursrymaid is not afraid of what you people call
 work
 So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid
 ofallwork
 And that is how you find me now a member of your shy
 lot
 Which you wouldnt have found had he been bound
 apprentice to a pilot
 RUTH Oh pardon Frederic pardon Kneels
 FREDERIC Rise sweet one I have long pardoned you Ruth
 rises
 RUTH The two words were so much alike
 FREDERIC They were They still are though years have rolled
 over their heads But this afternoon my obligation
 ceases Individually I love you all with affection
 unspeakable but collectively I look upon you with a
 disgust that amounts to absolute detestation Oh pity
 me my beloved friends for such is my sense of duty
 that once out of my indentures I shall feel myself
 bound to devote myself heart and soul to your
 extermination
 ALL Poor lad  poor lad All weep
 KING Well Frederic if you conscientiously feel that it is
 your duty to destroy us we cannot blame you for acting
 on that conviction Always act in accordance with the
 dictates of your conscience my boy and chance the
 consequences
 SAMUEL Besides we can offer you but little temptation to
 remain with us We dont seem to make piracy pay Im
 sure I dont know why but we dont
 FREDERIC I know why but alas I mustnt tell you it wouldnt
 be right
 KING Why not my boy Its only halfpast eleven and you
 are one of us until the clock strikes twelve
 SAMUEL True and until then you are bound to protect our
 interests
 ALL Hear hear
 FREDERIC Well then it is my duty as a pirate to tell you
 that you are too tenderhearted For instance you
 make a point of never attacking a weaker party than
 yourselves and when you attack a stronger party you
 invariably get thrashed
 KING There is some truth in that
 FREDERIC Then again you make a point of never molesting an
 orphan
 SAMUEL Of course we are orphans ourselves and know what it
 is
 FREDERIC Yes but it has got about and what is the consequence
 Every one we capture says hes an orphan The last
 three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by
 orphans and so we had to let them go One would think
 that Great Britains mercantile navy was recruited
 solely from her orphan asylums  which we know is not
 the case
 SAMUEL But hang it all you wouldnt have us absolutely
 merciless
 FREDERIC Theres my difficulty until twelve oclock I would
 after twelve I wouldnt Was ever a man placed in so
 delicate a situation
 RUTH And Ruth your own Ruth whom you love so well and who
 has won her middleaged way into your boyish heart
 what is to become of her
 KING Oh he will take you with him
 FREDERIC Well Ruth I feel some difficulty about you It is
 true that I admire you very much but I have been
 constantly at sea since I was eight years old and
 yours is the only womans face I have seen during that
 time I think it is a sweet face
 RUTH It is  oh it is
 FREDERIC I say I think it is that is my impression But as I
 have never had an opportunity of comparing you with
 other women it is just possible I may be mistaken
 KING True
 FREDERIC What a terrible thing it would be if I were to marry
 this innocent person and then find out that she is on
 the whole plain
 KING Oh Ruth is very well very well indeed
 SAMUEL Yes there are the remains of a fine woman about Ruth
 FREDERIC Do you really think so
 SAMUEL I do
 FREDERIC Then I will not be so selfish as to take her from you
 In justice to her and in consideration for you I will
 leave her behind Hands RUTH to KING
 KING No Frederic this must not be We are rough men who
 lead a rough life but we are not so utterly heartless
 as to deprive thee of thy love I think I am right in
 saying that there is not one here who would rob thee of
 this inestimable treasure for all the world holds dear
 ALL loudly Not one
 KING No I thought there wasnt Keep thy love Frederic
 keep thy love Hands her back to FREDERIC
 FREDERIC Youre very good Im sure Exit RUTH
 KING Well its the top of the tide and we must be off
 Farewell Frederic When your process of extermination
 begins let our deaths be as swift and painless as you
 can conveniently make them
 FREDERIC I will By the love I have for you I swear it Would
 that you could render this extermination unnecessary by
 accompanying me back to civilization
 KING No Frederic it cannot be I dont think much of our
 profession but contrasted with respectability it is
 comparatively honest No Frederic I shall live and
 die a Pirate King

 SONG  PIRATE KING

 KING Oh better far to live and die
 Under the brave black flag I fly
 Than play a sanctimonious part
 With a pirate head and a pirate heart
 Away to the cheating world go you
 Where pirates all are welltodo
 But Ill be true to the song I sing
 And live and die a Pirate King
 For I am a Pirate King
 And it is it is a glorious thing
 To be a Pirate King

 SOLOMABEL

 Dear father why leave your bed
 At this untimely hour
 When happy daylight is dead

 Dear father why leave your bed
 When happy daylight is dead

 MABEL Oh Frederic cannot you in the calm excellence of
 your wisdom reconcile it with your conscience to say
 something that will relieve my fathers sorrow
 FREDERIC I will try dear Mabel But why does he sit night
 after night in this draughty old ruin
 GENERAL Why do I sit here To escape from the pirates
 clutches I described myself as an orphan and heaven
 help me I am no orphan I come here to humble myself
 before the tombs of my ancestors and to implore their
 pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
 escutcheon
 FREDERIC But you forget sir you only bought the property a
 year ago and the stucco on your baronial castle is
 scarcely dry
 GENERAL Frederic in this chapel are ancestors you cannot deny
 that With the estate I bought the chapel and its
 contents I dont know whose ancestors they were but
 I know whose ancestors they are and I shudder to think
 that their descendant by purchase if I may so describe
 myself should have brought disgrace upon what I have
 no doubt was an unstained escutcheon
 FREDERIC Be comforted Had you not acted as you did these
 reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
 clergyman and have married your large family on the
 spot
 GENERAL I thank you for your proffered solace but it is
 unavailing I assure you Frederic that such is the
 anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
 by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates that I
 would go to their simpleminded chief this very night
 and confess all did I not fear that the consequences
 would be most disastrous to myself At what time does
 your expedition march against these scoundrels
 FREDERIC At eleven and before midnight I hope to have atoned
 for my involuntary association with the pestilent
 scourges by sweeping them from the face of the earth
 and then dear Mabel you will be mine
 GENERAL Are your devoted followers at hand
 FREDERIC They are they only wait my orders

 RUTH When you had left our pirate fold
 We tried to raise our spirits faint
 According to our custom old
 With quips and quibbles quaint
 But all in vain the quips we heard
 We lay and sobbed upon the rocks
 Until to somebody occurred

 FREDERIC A paradox
 KING laughing A paradox
 RUTH A most ingenious paradox
 Weve quips and quibbles heard in flocks
 But none to beat this paradox
 A paradox a paradox

 Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha
 KING We knew your taste for curious quips
 For cranks and contradictions queer
 And with the laughter on our lips
 We wished you there to hear
 We said If we could tell it him
 How Frederic would the joke enjoy
 And so weve risked both life and limb
 To tell it to our boy

 CHANTKING

 For some ridiculous reason to which however Ive no desire to
 be disloyal
 Some person in authority I dont know who very likely the
 Astronomer Royal
 Has decided that although for such a beastly month as February
 twentyeight days as a rule are plenty
 One year in every four his days shall be reckoned as nine and
 twenty
 Through some singular coincidence I shouldnt be surprised if
 it were owing to the agency of an illnatured fairy
 You are the victim of this clumsy arrangement having been born
 in leapyear on the twentyninth of February
 And so by a simple arithmetical process youll easily discover
 That though youve lived twentyone years yet if we go by
 birthdays youre only five and a little bit over
 RUTH Ha ha ha ha
 KING Ho ho ho ho
 FREDERIC Dear me
 Lets see counting on fingers
 Yes yes with yours my figures do agree
 ALL Ha ha ha ho ho ho ho
 FREDERIC more amused than any How quaint the ways of Paradox
 At common sense she gaily mocks
 Though counting in the usual way
 Years twentyone Ive been alive
 Yet reckning by my natal day
 Yet reckning by my natal day
 I am a little boy of five
 RUTHKING He is a little boy of five
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

 laughter

 FREDERIC Upon my word this is most curious most absurdly
 whimsical Fiveandaquarter No one would think it
 to look at me
 RUTH You are glad now Ill be bound that you spared us
 You would never have forgiven yourself when you
 discovered that you had killed two of your comrades
 FREDERIC My comrades
 KING rises Im afraid you dont appreciate the delicacy
 of your position You were apprenticed to us
 FREDERIC Until I reached my twentyfirst year
 KING No until you reached your twentyfirst birthday
 producing document and going by birthdays you are
 as yet only fiveandaquarter
 FREDERIC You dont mean to say you are going to hold me to that
 KING No we merely remind you of the fact and leave the
 rest to your sense of duty
 RUTH Your sense of duty
 FREDERIC wildly Dont put it on that footing As I was
 merciful to you just now be merciful to me I implore
 you not to insist on the letter of your bond just as
 the cup of happiness is at my lips
 RUTH We insist on nothing we content ourselves with
 pointing out to you your duty
 KING Your duty
 FREDERIC after a pause Well you have appealed to my sense of
 duty and my duty is only too clear I abhor your
 infamous calling I shudder at the thought that I have

 Enter King Hildebrand
 with Cyril

 Hildebd See you no sign of Gama

 Florian None my liege

 Hildebd Its very odd indeed If Gama fail
 To put in an appearance at our Court
 Before the sun has set in yonder west
 And fail to bring the Princess Ida here
 To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed
 At the extremely early age of one
 Theres war between King Gama and ourselves
 aside to Cyril
 Oh Cyril how I dread this interview
 Its twenty years since he and I have met
 He was a twisted monster  all awry
 As though Dame Nature angry with her work
 Had crumpled it in fitful petulance

 Cyril But sir a twisted and ungainly trunk
 Often bears goodly fruit Perhaps he was
 A kind wellspoken gentleman

 Hildebd Oh no
 For adderlike his sting lay in his tongue
 His sting is present though his stung is past

 Florian looking through glass
 But stay my liege oer yonder mountains brow
 Comes a small body bearing Gamas arms
 And now I look more closely at it sir
 I see attached to it King Gamas legs
 From which I gather this corollary
 That that small body must be Gamas own

 Hildebd Ha Is the Princess with him

 Florian Well my liege
 Unless her highness is full six feet high
 And wears mustachios too  and smokes cigars
 And rides en cavalier in coat of steel
 I do not think she is

 Hildebd One never knows
 Shes a strange girl Ive heard and does odd
 things
 Come bustle there
 For Gama place the richest robes we own
 For Gama place the coarsest prison dress
 For Gama let our best spare bed be aired
 For Gama let our deepest dungeon yawn
 For Gama lay the costliest banquet out
 For Gama place cold water and dry bread
 For as King Gama brings the Princess here
 Or brings her not so shall King Gama have
 Much more than everything  much less than nothing

 SONG Hildebrand and Chorus
 Now Hearken to my Strict Command

 Hildebd Now hearken to my strict command
 On every hand on every hand

 Chorus To your command
 On every hand
 We dutifully bow

 Hildebd If Gama bring the Princess here
 Give him good cheer give him good cheer

 Chorus If she come here
 Well give him a cheer
 And we will show you how
 Hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah
 Hip hip hurrah hurrah hurrah
 Well shout and sing
 Long live the King
 And his daughter too I trow
 Then shout ha ha hip hip hurrah
 Hip hip hip hip hurrah
 For the fair Princess and her good papa
 Hurrah hurrah

 Hildebd But if he fail to keep his troth
 Upon our oath well trounce them both

 Chorus Hell trounce them both
 Upon his oath
 As sure as quarterday

 Hildebd Well shut him up in a dungeon cell
 And toll his knell on a funeral bell

 Chorus From his dungeon cell
 His funeral knell
 Shall strike him with dismay
 Hip hip hurrah hip hip hurrah
 Hip hip hurrah hurrah hurrah
 As up we string
 The faithless King
 In the old familiar way
 Well shout ha ha hip hip hurrah
 Hip hip hip hip hurrah
 As we make an end of her false papa
 Hurrah hurrah

 RECITATIVE AND SONG Hilarion
 Today we meet

 RECITATIVE  Hilarion

 Today we meet my baby bride and I
 But ah my hopes are balancd by my fears
 What transmutations have been conjurd by
 The silent alchemy of twenty years

 BALLAD  Hilarion

 Ida was a twelvemonth old
 Twenty years ago
 I was twice her age Im told
 Twenty years ago
 Husband twice as old as wife
 Argues ill for married life
 Baleful prophecies were rife
 Twenty years ago
 Twenty years ago

 Still I was a tiny prince
 Twenty years ago
 She has gained upon me since
 Twenty years ago
 Though shes twentyone its true
 I am barely twentytwo
 False and foolish prophets you
 Twenty years ago
 Twenty years ago

 Enter Hildebrand

 Hilarion Well father is there news for me at last

 Hildebd King Gama is in sight but much I fear
 With no Princess

 Hilarion Alas my liege Ive heard
 That Princess Ida has forsworn the world
 And with a band of women shut herself
 Within a lonely country house and there
 Devotes herself to stern philosophies

 Hildebd Then I should say the loss of such a wife
 Is one to which a reasonable man
 Would easily be reconciled

 Hilarion Oh no
 Or I am not a reasonable man
 She is my wife  has been for twenty years
 Holding glass I think I see her now

 Hildebd Ha Let me look

 Hilarion In my minds eye I mean  a blushing bride
 All bib and tucker frill and furbelow
 How exquisite she looked as she was borne
 Recumbent in her fostermothers arms
 How the bride wept  nor would be comforted
 Until the hireling motherforthenonce
 Administered refreshment in the vestry
 And I remember feeling much annoyed
 That she should weep at marrying with me
 But then I thought These brides are all alike
 You cry at marrying me How much more cause
 Youd have to cry if it were broken off
 These were my thoughts I kept them to myself
 For at that age I had not learnt to speak

 Exeunt Hildebrand
 and Hilarion

 SONG Gama
 If you give me your Attention

 Gama If you give me your attention I will tell you what I
 am
 Im a genuine philanthropist  all other kinds are
 sham
 Each little fault of temper and each social defect
 In my erring fellowcreatures I endeavour to correct
 To all their little weaknesses I open peoples eyes
 And little plans to snub the selfsufficient I devise
 I love my fellow creatures  I do all the good I
 can
 Yet evrybody says Im such a disagreeable man
 And I cant think why

 To compliments inflated Ive a withering reply
 And vanity I always do my best to mortify
 A charitable action I can skillfully dissect
 And interested motives Im delighted to detect
 I know evrybodys income and what evrybody earns
 And I carefully compare it with the incometax
 returns
 But to benefit humanity however much I plan
 Yet evrybody says Im such a disagreeable man
 And I cant think why

 Im sure Im no ascetic Im as pleasant as can be
 Youll always find me ready with a crushing repartee
 Ive an irritating chuckle Ive a celebrated sneer
 Ive an entertaining snigger Ive a fascinating leer
 To evrybodys prejudice I know a thing or two
 I can tell a womans age in half a minute  and I do
 But although I try to make myself as pleasant as I
 can
 Yet evrybody says Im such a disagreeable man
 And I cant think why

 Chorus He cant think why
 He cant think why

 Enter Hildebrand Hilarion Cyril and Florian

 Gama So this is Castle Hildebrand Well well
 Dame Rumour whispered that the place was grand
 She told me that your taste was exquisite
 Superb unparalleled

 Hildebnd Gratified Oh really King

 Gama But shes a liar Why how old youve grown
 Is this Hilarion Why youve changed too
 You were a singularly handsome child
 To Florian Are you a courtier Come then ply your trade
 Tell me some lies How do you like your King
 Vile rumour says hes all but imbecile
 Now thats not true

 Florian My lord we love our King
 His wise remarks are valued by his court
 As precious stones

 Gama And for the selfsame cause
 Like precious stones his sensible remarks
 Derive their value from their scarcity
 Come now be honest tell the truth for once
 Tell it of me Come come Ill harm you not
 This leg is crooked  this foot is illdesigned
 This shoulder wears a hump Come out with it
 Look heres my face Now am I not the worst
 Of Natures blunders

 Cyril Nature never errs
 To those who know the workings of your mind
 Your face and figure sir suggest a book
 Appropriately bound

 Gama Enraged Why harkye sir
 How dare you bandy words with me

 Cyril No need
 To bandy aught that appertains to you

 Gama Furiously Do you permit this King

 Hildebd We are in doubt
 Whether to treat you as an honoured guest
 Or as a traitor knave who plights his word
 And breaks it

 Gama Quickly If the casting votes with me
 I give it for the former

 Hildebd We shall see
 By the terms of our contract signed and sealed
 Youre bound to bring the Princess here today
 Why is she not with you

 Gama Answer me this
 What think you of a wealthy purseproud man
 Who when he calls upon a starving friend
 Pulls out his gold and flourishes his notes
 And flashes diamonds in the paupers eyes
 What name have you for such an one

 Hildebd A snob

 Gama Just so The girl has beauty virtue wit
 Grace humour wisdom charity and pluck
 Would it be kindly think you to parade
 These brilliant qualities before your eyes
 Oh no King Hildebrand I am no snob

 Hildebd Furiously Stop that tongue
 Or you shall lose the monkey head that holds it

 Gama Bravo Your King deprives me of my head
 That he and I may meet on equal terms

 Hildebd Where is she now Threatening

 Gama In Castle Adamant
 One of my many country houses There
 She rules a womans University
 With full a hundred girls who learn of her

 Cyril A hundred girls A hundred ecstasies

 Gama But no mere girls my good young gentleman
 With all the college learning that you boast
 The youngest there will prove a match for you

 Cyril With all my heart if shes the prettiest
 To Florian Fancy a hundred matches  all alight
 Thats if I strike them as I hope to do

 Gama Despair your hope their hearts are dead to men
 He who desires to gain their favour must
 Be qualified to strike their teeming brains
 And not their hearts Theyre safety matches sir
 And they light only on the knowledge box
 So youve no chance

 Florian And there are no males whatever in those walls

 Gama None gentlemen excepting letter mails
 And they are driven as males often are
 In other large communities by women
 Why bless my heart shes so particular
 Shell hardly suffer Dr Wattss hymns
 And all the animals she owns are hers
 The ladies rise at cockcrow every morn

 Cyril Ah then they have male poultry

 Gama Not at all
 Confidentially The crowings done by an accomplished hen

ACT II

 SCENE Gardens in Castle Adamant A river runs across the
 back of the stage crossed by a rustic bridge Castle
 Adamant in the distance

 Girl Graduates discovered seated at the feet of Lady
 Psyche

 CHORUS OF GIRLS  SOLOS Lady Psyche Melissa and
 Sacharissa
 Towards the empyrean heights

 Chorus Towards the empyrean heights
 Of evry kind of lore
 Weve taken several easy flights
 And mean to take some more
 In trying to achieve success
 No envy racks our heart
 And all the knowledge we possess
 We mutually impart

 SOLO  Melissa

 Pray what authors should she read
 Who in Classics would succeed

 SOLO  Psyche

 If youd climb the Helicon
 You should read Anacreon
 Ovids Metamorphoses
 Likewise Aristophanes
 And the works of Juvenal
 These are worth attention all
 But if you will be advised
 You will get them Bowdlerized

 Chorus Ah we will get them Bowdlerized

 SOLO  Sacharissa

 Pray you tell us if you can
 Whats the thing thats known as Man

 SOLO  Psyche

 Man will swear and man will storm
 Man is not at all good form
 Is of no kind of use
 Mans a donkey  Mans a goose
 Man is coarse and Man is plain
 Man is more or less insane
 Mans a ribald  Mans a rake
 Man is Natures sole mistake

 Chorus Well a memorandum make
 Man is Natures sole mistake

 And thus to empyrean height
 Of evry kind of lore
 In search of wisdoms pure delight
 Ambitiously we soar
 In trying to achieve success
 No envy racks our heart
 For all we know and all we guess
 We mutually impart
 And all the knowledge we possess
 We mutually impart
 We mutually impart impart

 Enter Lady Blanche All stand up demurely

 Blanche Attention ladies while I read to you
 The Princess Idas list of punishments
 The first is Sacharissa Shes expelled

 All Expelled

 Blan Expelled because although she knew
 No man of any kind may pass our walls
 She dared to bring a set of chessmen here

 Sach Crying I meant no harm theyre only men of wood

 Blan Theyre men with whom you give each other mate
 And thats enough The next is Chloe

 Chloe Ah

 Blan Chloe will lose three terms for yesterday
 When looking through her drawingbook I found
 A sketch of a perambulator

 All Horrified Oh

 Blan Double perambulator

 All Oh oh

 Blan shameless girl
 Thats all at present Now attention pray
 Your Principal the Princess comes to give
 Her usual inaugural address
 To those young ladies who joined yesterday

 CHORUS OF GIRLS
 Mighty maiden with a mission

 Girls Mighty maiden with a mission
 Paragon of common sense
 Running fount of erudition
 Miracle of eloquence
 Altos We are blind and we
 would see
 Sops We are bound and would be free

 Girls We are dumb and we would talk
 We are lame and we would walk
 Enter

 Mighty maiden with a mission
 Paragon of common sense
 Running found of erudition
 Miracle of eloquence of eloquence

 RECITATIVE  ARIA Princess
 Minerva Oh hear Me

 Princess Minerva Minerva
 Oh hear me
 Oh goddess wise
 That lovest light
 Endow with sight
 Their unillumind eyes

 At this my call
 A fervent few
 Have come to woo
 The rays that from thee fall
 That from thee fall
 Oh goddess wise
 That lovest light
 That lovest light

 Let fervent words and fervent thoughts be mine
 That I may lead them to thy sacred shrine
 Let fervent words and fervent thoughts be mine
 That I may lead them to thy sacred shrine

 Princess Women of Adamant fair Neophytes
 Who thirst for such instruction as we give
 Attend while I unfold a parable
 The elephant is mightier than Man
 Yet Man subdues him Why The elephant
 Is elephantine everywhere but here tapping her
 forehead
 And Man whose brain is to the elephants
 As Womans brain to Mans  thats rule of three
 Conquers the foolish giant of the woods
 As Woman in her turn shall conquer Man
 In Mathematics Woman leads the way
 The narrowminded pedant still believes
 That two and two make four Why we can prove
 We women  household drudges as we are
 That two and two make five  or three  or seven
 Or five and twenty if the case demands
 Diplomacy The wiliest diplomat
 Is absolutely helpless in our hands
 He wheedles monarchs  Woman wheedles him
 Logic Why tyrant Man himself admits
 Its a waste of time to argue with a woman
 Then we excel in social qualities
 Though man professes that he holds our sex
 In utter scorn I venture to believe
 Hed rather pass the day with one of you
 Than with five hundred of his fellowmen
 In all things we excel Believing this
 A hundred maidens here have sworn to place
 Their feet upon his neck If we succeed
 Well treat him better than he treated us
 But if we fail why then let hope fail too
 Let no one care a penny how she looks
 Let red be worn with yellow  blue with green
 Crimson with scarlet  violet with blue
 Let all your things misfit and you yourselves
 At inconvenient moments come undone
 Let hairpins lose their virtue let the hook
 Disdain the fascination of the eye
 The bashful button modestly evade
 The soft embraces of the buttonhole
 Let old associations all dissolve
 Let Swan secede from Edgar  Gask from Gask
 Sewell from Cross  Lewis from Allenby
 In other words let Chaos come again
 Coming down Who lectures in the Hall of Arts today

 Blanche I madam on Abstract Philosophy
 There I propose considering at length
 Three points  The Is the Might Be and the Must
 Whether the Is from being actual fact
 Is more important than the vague Might Be
 Or the Might Be from taking wider scope
 Is for that reason greater than the Is
 And lastly how the Is and Might Be stand
 Compared with the inevitable Must

 Princess The subjects deep  how do you treat it pray

 Blan Madam I take three possibilities
 And strike a balance then between the three
 As thus The Princess Ida Is our head
 the Lady Psyche Might Be  Lady Blanche
 Neglected Blanche inevitably Must
 Given these three hypotheses  to find
 The actual betting against each of them

 Princess Your themes ambitious pray you bear in mind
 Who highest soar fall farthest Fare you well
 You and your pupils Maidens follow me

 Exeunt Princess
 and maidens
 Manet
 Lady Blanche

 EXEUNT FOR PRINCESS IDA  GIRLS
 And thus to Empyrean Height

 Chorus And thus to empyrean height
 Of evry kind of lore
 In search of wisdoms pure delight
 Ambitiously we soar
 In trying to achieve success
 No envy racks our heart
 For all we know and all we guess
 We mutually impart
 And all the knowledge we possess
 We mutually impart
 We mutually impart impart

 Blan I should command here  I was born to rule
 But do I rule I dont Why I dont know
 I shall some day Not yet I bide my time
 I once was Some One  and the Was Will Be
 The Present as we speak becomes the Past
 The Past repeats itself and so is Future
 This sounds involved Its not Its right enough

 Since 1935 the following song has been usually omitted
 SONG Lady Blanche
 Come mighty Must

 Blanche Come mighty Must
 Inevitable Shall
 In thee I trust
 Time weaves my coronal
 Go mocking Is

 Yet humble second shall be first
 I wean
 And dead and buried be the curst
 Has Been

 Oh weak Might Be
 Oh May Might Could Would Should
 How powrless ye
 For evil or for good
 In evry sense
 Your moods I cheerless call
 Whateer your tense
 Ye are imperfect all
 Ye have deceivd the trust Ive shown
 In ye
 Ye have deceivd the trust Ive shown

 These are the phenomena
 That evry pretty domina
 Is hoping at her Universitee we shall see

 Hilarion So thats the Princess Idas castle Well
 They must be lovely girls indeed if it requires
 Such walls as those to keep intruders off

 Cyril To keep men off is only half their charge
 And that the easier half I much suspect
 The object of these walls is not so much
 To keep men off as keep the maidens in

 Florian But what are these Examining some Collegiate robes

 Hilarion looking at them Why Academic robes
 Worn by the lady undergraduates
 When they matriculate Lets try them on They do
 so
 Why see  were covered to the very toes
 Three lovely lady undergraduates
 Who weary of the world and all its wooing  pose

 Florian And penitent for deeds theres no undoing  pose

 Cyril Looked at askance by wellconducted maids  pose

 All Seek sanctuary in these classic shades

 TRIO Cyril Hilarion and Florian
 I am a maiden

 Hilarion I am a maiden cold and stately
 Heartless I with face divine
 What do I want with a heart innately
 Every heart I meet is mine
 Every heart I meet is mine is mine

 All Haughty humble coy or free
 Little care I what maid may be
 So that a maid is fair to see
 Evry maid is the maid for me

 Dance

 Cyril I am a maiden frank and simple
 Brimming with joyous roguery
 Merriment lurks in evry dimple
 Nobody breaks more hearts than I
 Nobody breaks more hearts more hearts than
 I

 All Haughty humble coy or free
 Little care I what maid may be
 So that a maid is fair to see
 Evry maid is the maid for me

 Dance

 Florian I am a maiden coyly blushing
 Timid am I as a startled hind
 Every suitor sets me flushing
 Every suitor sets me flushing
 I am the maid that wins mankind

 All Haughty humble coy or free
 Little care I what maid may be
 So that a maid is fair to see
 Evry maid is the maid for me
 Haughty humble coy or free
 Little care I what maid may be
 So that a maid is fair to see
 Evry maid is the maid for me

 Enter the Princess reading She does not

 Hilarion Aside Why we must brave it out
 Aloud Madam accept our humblest reverence

 They bow then suddenly recollecting
 themselves curtsey

 Princess Surprised We greet you ladies What would you

 Hilarion Aside to Cyril
 What shall I say Aloud We are three students
 maam
 Three wellborn maids of liberal estate
 Who wish to join this University

 Hilarion and Florian curtsey again Cyril bows
 extravagantly
 then being recalled to himself by Florian
 curtseys

 Princess If as you say you wish to join our ranks
 And will subscribe to all our rules tis well

 Florian To all your rules we cheerfully subscribe

 Princess You say youre noblewomen Well youll find
 No sham degrees for noblewomen here
 Youll find no sizars here or servitors
 Or other cruel distinctions meant to draw
 A line twixt rich and poor youll find no tufts
 To mark nobility except such tufts
 As indicate nobility of brain
 As for your fellowstudents mark me well
 There are a hundred maids within these walls
 All good all learned and all beautiful
 They are prepared to love you will you swear
 To give the fullness of your love to them

 Hilarion Upon our words and honours Maam we will

 Princess But we go further Will you undertake
 That you will never marry any man

 Florian Indeed we never will

 Princess Consider well
 You must prefer our maids to all mankind

 Hilarion To all mankind we much prefer your maids

 Cyril We should be dolts indeed if we did not seeing how
 fair 

 Hilarion Aside to Cyril Take care  thats rather strong

 Princess But have you left no lovers at your home
 Who may pursue you here

 Hilarion No madam none
 Were homely ladies as no doubt you see
 And we have never fished for lovers love
 We smile at girls who deck themselves with gems
 False hair and meretricious ornament
 To chain the fleeting fancy of a man
 But do not imitate them What we have
 Of hair is all our own Our colour too
 Unladylike but not unwomanly
 Is Natures handiwork and man has learnt
 To reckon Nature an impertinence

 Princess Well beauty counts for naught within these walls
 If all you say is true youll pass with us
 A happy happy time

 Cyril If as you say
 A hundred lovely maidens wait within
 To welcome us with smiles and open arms
 I think theres very little doubt we shall

 Florian Aside Heres a catastrophe Hilarion
 This is my sister Shell remember me
 Though years have passed since she and I have met

 Hilarion Aside to Florian Then make a virtue of necessity
 And trust our secret to her gentle care

 Psyche Why dont you know me Florian

 Psyche Amazed Why Florian

 Florian My sister Embraces her

 Psyche Oh my dear What are you doing here  and who are

 Hilarion I am that Prince Hilarion to whom
 Your Princess is betrothed I come to claim
 Her plighted love Your brother Florian
 And Cyril came to see me safely through

 Psyche The Prince Hilarion Cyril too How strange
 My earliest playfellows

 Hilarion Why let me look
 Are you that learned little Psyche who
 At school alarmed her mates because she called
 A buttercup ranunculus bulbosus

 Cyril Are you indeed that Lady Psyche who
 At childrens parties drove the conjuror wild
 Explaining all his tricks before he did them

 Hilarion Are you that learned little Psyche who
 At dinner parties brought in to dessert
 Would tackle visitors with You dont know
 Who first determined longitude  I do 
 Hipparchus twas  B C one sixtythree
 Are you indeed that small phenomenon

 Psyche That small phenomenon indeed am I
 But gentlemen tis death to enter here
 We have all promised to renounce mankind

 Florian Renounce mankind On what ground do you base
 This senseless resolution

 Psyche Senseless No
 We are all taught and being taught believe
 That Man sprung from an Ape is Ape at heart

 Cyril Thats rather strong

 Psyche The truth is always strong

 SONG Lady Psyche with Cyril Hilarion and Florian
 A Lady Fair of Lineage High

 Psyche A Lady fair of lineage high
 Was loved by an Ape in the days gone by
 The Maid was radiant as the sun
 The Ape was a most unsightly one
 The Ape was a most unsightly one
 So it would not do
 His scheme fell through
 For the Maid when his love took formal shape
 Expressd such terror
 At his monstrous error
 That he stammerd an apology and made his scape
 The picture of a disconcerted Ape

 With a view to rise in the social scale
 He shaved his bristles and he docked his tail
 He grew mustachios and he took his tub
 And he paid a guinea to a toilet club
 He paid a guinea to a toilet club
 But it would not do
 The scheme fell through
 For the Maid was Beautys fairest Queen
 With golden tresses
 Like a real princesss
 While the Ape despite his razor keen
 Was the apiest Ape that ever was seen
 He bought white ties and he bought dress suits
 He crammed his feet into bright tight boots
 And to start in life on a brandnew plan
 He christend himself Darwinian Man
 But it would not do
 The scheme fell through
 For the Maiden fair whom the monkey cravd
 Was a radiant Being
 With brain farseeing
 While Darwinian Man though wellbehavd
 At best is only a monkey shavd

 3 Men For the Maiden fair whom the monkey cravd

 All Was a radiant being
 With a brain farseeing
 While Darwinian Man though wellbehavd
 At best is only a monkey shavd

 During this Melissa has entered
 unobserved
 she looks on in
 amazement

 Melissa Coming down Oh Lady Psyche

 Psyche Terrified What You heard us then
 Oh all is lost

 Melissa Not so Ill breathe no word
 Advancing in astonishment to Florian
 How marvelously strange and are you then
 Indeed young men

 Florian Well yes just now we are
 But hope by dint of study to become
 In course of time young women

 Melissa Eagerly No no no 
 Oh dont do that Is this indeed a man
 Ive often heard of them but till today
 Never set eyes on one They told me men
 Were hideous idiotic and deformed
 They are quite as beautiful as women are
 As beautiful theyre infinitely more so
 Their cheeks have not that pulpy softness which
 One gets so weary of in womankind
 Their features are more marked  and  oh their
 chins
 Feeling Florians chin
 How curious

 Florian I fear its rather rough

 Melissa Eagerly Oh dont apologize  I like it so

 QUINTET Psyche Melissa Cyril Hilarion and Florian
 The Woman of the Wisest Wit

 Psyche The woman of the wisest win
 May sometimes be mistaken O
 In Idas views I must admit
 My faith is somewhat shaken O

 But Mans a theme with which she is
 Entirely unacquainted O

 Your powers of observation O
 servation O

 All Then jump for joy and gaily bound
 The truth is found the truth is found
 Set bells aringing through the air

 Ida my love my life Oh come to me
 If it be well I say to do all this

 Princess He breathes our name Well its a common one
 And is the booby comely

 Hilarion Pretty well
 Ive heard it said that if I dressed myself
 In Prince Hilarions clothes supposing this
 Consisted with my maiden modesty
 I might be taken for Hilarions self
 But what is this to you or me who think
 Of all mankind with undisguised contempt

 Princess Contempt Why damsel when I think of man
 Contempt is not the word

 Cyril Getting tipsy Im sure of that

 SONG Cyril
 Would you know the Kind of Maid

 During symphony Hilarion and
 Florian try to
 stop Cyril He shakes them
 off angrily

 Cyril Would you know the kind of maid
 Sets my heart aflamea
 Eyes must be downcast and staid
 Cheeks must flush for shamea
 She may neither dance nor sing
 But demure in everything
 Hang her head in modest way
 With pouting lips with pouting lips
 that
 seem to say
 Oh kiss me kiss me kiss me kiss me
 Though I die of shamea
 Please you thats the kind of maid
 Sets my heart aflamea
 Kiss me kiss me kiss me kiss me
 Though I die of shamea
 Please you thats the kind of maid
 Sets my heart aflamea

 When a maid is bold and gay
 With a tongue goes clanga
 Flaunting it in brave array
 Maiden may go hanga
 Sunflowr gay and hollyhock
 Never shall my garden stock
 Mine the blushing rose of May
 With pouting lips with pouting lips
 that
 seem to say
 Oh kiss me kiss me kiss me kiss me
 Though I die for shamea
 Please you thats the kind of maid
 Sets my heart aflamea
 Kiss me kiss me kiss me kiss me
 Though I die of shamea
 Please you thats the kind of maid
 Sets my heart aflamea

 SONG  Hilarion

 Hilarion Whom thou has chaind must wear his chain
 Thou canst not set him free

 Who lives by loving thee
 If heart of stone for heart of fire
 Be all thou hast to give
 If dead to my hearts desire
 Why should I wish to live

 Cyr  Flo Have Girls Have
 mercy O Mer
 lady cy

 Hilarion No word of thine  no stern command
 Can teach my heart to rove
 Then rather perish by thy hand
 Than live without thy love

 RECITATIVE

 Princess Audacious tyrant do you dare
 To beard a maiden in her lair

 Hildebd Since you inquire
 Weve no desire
 To beard a maiden here or anywhere

 Soldiers No no Weve no desire
 To beard a maiden here or anywhere

 SOLO  Hildebrand

 Hildebd Some years ago
 No doubt you know
 And if you dont Ill tell you so
 You gave your troth
 Upon your oath
 To Hilarion my son
 A vow you make
 You must not break
 If you think you may its a great mistake
 For a brides a bride
 Though the knot were tied
 At the early age of one
 And Im a peppery kind of King
 Whose indisposed for parleying
 To fit the wit of a bit of chit
 And thats the long and the short of
 it

 Soldiers For hes a peppery kind of King
 Whose indisposed for parleying
 To fit the wit of a bit of chit
 And thats the long and the short of it

 Hildebd If you decide
 To pocket your pride
 And let Hilarion claim his bride
 Why well and good
 Its understood
 Well let bygones go by
 But if you choose
 To sulk in the blues
 Ill make the whole of you shake in your shoes
 Ill storm your walls
 And level your halls
 In the winking of an eye
 For Im a peppery Potentate
 Whos little inclined his claim to
 bate
 To fit the wit of a bit of a chit
 And thats the long and the short of
 it

 Soldiers For hes a peppery Potentate
 Whose indisposed for parleying
 To fit the wit of a bit of chit
 And thats the long and the short of it

 TRIO  Arac Guron  Scynthius

 Scynthius Yes

 Guron Yes

 Arac Yes

 All 3 Better praps to name it

 Our interests we would not press

 Three hulking brothers more or less

 But when he says hell hang a man
 Hell do it
 To each other
 Scynthius Yes

 Guron Yes

 Arac Yes

 All 3 Devil doubt hell do it

 Princess Be reassured nor fear his anger blind

 And be his bride
 Or youll incur the guilt of fratricide

 Princess To yield at once to such a foe
 With shame were rife
 So quick away with him although
 He savd my life
 That he is fair and strong and tall
 Is very evident to all
 Yet I will die
 Yet I will die before I call myself his

 Princess All Others

ACT III

 SCENE  Outer Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant Melissa
 SachaRissa and ladies discovered armed with
 battleaxes

 CHORUS
 Death to the Invader

 Chorus Death to the invader
 Strike a deadly blow
 As an old Crusader
 Struck his Paynim foe
 Let our martial thunder
 Fill his soul with wonder
 Tear his ranks asunder
 Lay the tyrant low
 Death to the invader
 Strike a deadly blow
 As an old Crusader
 Struck his Paynim foe

 Melissa Thus our courage all untarnishd
 Were instructed to display
 But to tell the truth unvarnishd
 We are more inclined to say
 Please you do not hurt us

 All Do not hurt us if it please you

 Melissa Please you let us be

 All Let us be  let us be

 Melissa Soldiers disconcert us

 All Disconcert us if it please you

 Melissa Frightend maids are we

 All Maids are we maids are we

 Melissa Please you

 All Do not hurt us

 Melissa Please you

 All Let us be

 Mel  Cho Frightend maids are we frightend maids are we

 Melissa But twould be an error
 To confess our terror
 So in Idas name
 Boldly we exclaim

 Mel  Cho Death to the invader
 Strike a deadly blow
 As an old Crusader
 Struck his Paynim foe

 Flourish Enter Princess armed attended by Blanche and Psyche

 Princess I like your spirit girls We have to meet
 Stern bearded warriors in fight today
 Wear naught but what is necessary to
 Preserve your dignity before their eyes
 And give your limbs full play

 Blanche One moment maam
 Here is a paradox we should not pass
 Without inquiry We are prone to say
 This thing is Needful  that Superfluous
 Yet they invariably coexist
 We find the Needful comprehended in
 The circle of the grand Superfluous
 Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
 Unless youre amply furnished with the Needful
 These singular considerations are

 Princess Superfluous yet not Needful  so you see
 The terms may independently exist
 To Ladies Women of Adamant we have to show
 That women educated to the task
 Can meet Man face to face on his own ground
 And beat him there Now let us set to work
 Where is our lady surgeon

 Sach Madam here

 Princess We shall require your skill to heal the wounds
 Of those that fall

 Sach Alarmed What heal the wounded

 Princess Yes

 Sach And cut off real live legs and arms

 Princess Of course

 Sach I wouldnt do it for a thousand pounds

 Princess Why how is this Are you fainthearted girl
 Youve often cut them off in theory

 Sach In theory Ill cut them off again
 With pleasure and as often as you like
 But not in practice

 Princess Coward Get you hence
 Ive craft enough for that and courage too
 Ill do your work My fusiliers advance
 Why you are armed with axes Gilded toys
 Where are your rifles pray

 Chloe Why please you maam
 We left them in the armoury for fear
 That in the heat and turmoil of the fight
 They might go off

 Princess They might Oh craven souls
 Go off yourselves Thank heaven I have a heart
 That quails not at the thought of meeting men
 I will discharge your rifles Off with you

 Exit Chloe
 Wheres my bandmistress

 Ada Please you maam the band
 Do not feel well and cant come out today

 Princess Why this is flat rebellion Ive no time
 To talk to them just now But happily
 I can play several instruments at once
 And I will drown the shrieks of those that fall
 With trumpet music such as soldiers love
 How stand we with respect to gunpowder
 My Lady Psyche  you who superintend
 Our labratory  are you well prepared
 To blow these bearded rascals into shreds

 Psyche Why madam

 Princess Well

 Psyche Let us try gentler means
 We can dispense with fulminating grains
 While we have eyes with which to flash our rage
 We can dispense with villainous saltpetre
 While we have tongues with which to blow them up
 We can dispense in short with all the arts
 That brutalize the practical polemist

 Princess Contemptuously I never knew a more dispensing
 chemist
 Away away  Ill meet these men alone
 Since all my women have deserted me

 Exeunt all but Princess singing
 refrain of
 Please you do not hurt us
 pianissimo

 Princess So fail my cherished plans  so fails my faith
 And with it hope and all that comes of hope

 Song  Princess
 I Built upon a Rock

 Princess I built upon a rock
 But ere Destructions hand
 Dealt equal lot
 To Court and cot
 My rock had turnd to sand
 I leant upon an oak
 But in the hour of need
 Alackaday
 My trusted stay
 Was but a bruised reed
 A bruised reed
 Ah faithless rock
 My simple faith to mock
 Ah traitrous oak
 Thy worthlessness to cloak
 Thy worthlessness to cloak

 I drew a sword of steel
 But when to home and hearth
 The battles breath
 Bore fire and death
 My sword was but a lath
 I lit a beacon fire
 But on a stormy day
 Of frost and rime
 In wintertime
 My fire had died away
 Had died away
 Ah coward steel
 That fear can unanneal
 False fire indeed
 To fail me in my need
 To fail me in my need

 Princess Sinks upon a rock Enter Chloe and all the Ladies

 Chloe Madam your father and your brothers claim
 An audience

 Princess What do they do here

 Chloe They come
 To fight for you

 Princess Admit them

 Blanche Infamous
 Ones brothers maam are men

 Princess So I have heard
 But all my women seem to fail me when
 I need them most In this emergency
 Even ones brothers may be turned to use

 Gama Entering pale and unnerved My daughter

 Princess Father Thou art free

 Gama Aye free
 Free as a tethered ass I come to thee
 With words from Hildebrand Those duly given
 I must return to blank captivity
 Im free so far

 Princess Your message

 Gama Hildebrand
 Is loth to war with women Pit my sons
 My three brave sons against these popinjays
 These tufted jackadandy featherheads
 And on the issue let thy hand depend

 Princess Insult on insults head Are we a stake
 For fighting men What fiend possesses thee
 That thou has come with offers such as these
 From such as he to such an one as I

 Gama I am possessed
 By the pale devil of a shaking heart
 My stubborn will is bent I dare not face
 That devilish monarchs black malignity
 He tortures me with torments worse than death
 I havent anything to grumble at
 He finds out what particular meats I love
 And gives me them The very choicest wines
 The costliest robes  the richest rooms are mine
 He suffers none to thwart my simplest plan
 And gives strict orders none should contradict me
 Hes made my life a curse Weeps

 Princess My tortured father

 SONG King GAMA with CHORUS of GIRLS
 Wheneer I Spoke

 Gama Wheneer I poke
 Sarcastic joke
 Replete with malice spiteful
 This people mild
 Politely smild
 And voted me delightful

 Now when a wight
 Sits up all night
 Illnaturd jokes devising
 And all his wiles
 Are met with smiles
 Its hard theres no disguising

 Ah Oh dont the days seem lank and long
 When all goes right and nothing goes wrong
 And isnt your life extremely flat
 With nothing whatever to grumble at

 Chorus Oh isnt your life extremely flat
 With nothing whatever to grumble at

 Gama When German bands
 From music stands
 Playd Wagner imperfectly 
 I bade them go
 They didnt say no
 But off they went directly
 The organ boys
 They stoppd their noise
 With readiness surprising
 And grinning herds
 Of hurdygurds
 Retired apologising
 Ah Oh dont the days seem lank and long
 When all goes right and nothing goes wrong
 And isnt your life extremely flat
 With nothing whatever to grumble at

 Chorus Oh isnt your life extremely flat
 With nothing whatever to grumble at

 Gama I offerd gold
 In sums untold
 To all whod contradict me
 I said Id pay
 A pound a day
 To any one who kickd me
 Ive bribd with toys
 Great vulgar boys
 To utter something spiteful
 But bless you no
 They would be so
 Confoundedly politeful

 Ah In short these aggravating lads
 They tickle my tastes they feed my fads
 They give me this and they give me that
 And Ive nothing whatever to grumble at

 Chorus Oh isnt your life extremely flat
 With nothing whatever to grumble at

 Gama Bursts into tears and falls sobbing
 on a seat

 Princess My poor old father How he must have suffered
 Well well I yield

 Gama Hysterically She yields Im saved Im saved
 Exit

 Princess Open the gates  admit these warriors
 Then get you all within the castle walls
 Exit

 The gates are opened and the Girls mount the
 battlements as the
 Soldiers enter Arac Guron and Scynthius

 Chorus of Soldiers
 When anger spreads his wing

 Chorus When anger spread his wing
 And all seems dark as night for it
 Theres nothing but to fight for it
 But ere you pitch your ring
 Select a pretty site for it
 This spot is suited quite for it
 And then you gaily sing
 And then you gaily sing

 Oh I love the jolly rattle
 Of an ordeal by battle
 Theres an end of tittletattle
 When your enemy is dead

 Hilar Yes it is

 Gama Why you look handsome in your womens clothes
 Stick to em Mens attire becomes you not
 To CYRIL and FLORIAN And you young ladies will you please to

 King Hildebrand to set me free again
 Hang on his neck and gaze into his eyes
 He never could resist a pretty face

 Hilar You dog youll find though I wear womans garb
 My sword is long and sharp

 Gama Hush pretty one
 Heres a virago Heres a termagant
 If length and sharpness go for anything
 Youll want no sword while you can wag your tongue

 Cyril What need to waste your words on such as he
 Hes old and crippled

 Gama Aye but Ive three sons
 Fine fellows young and muscular and brave
 Theyre well worth talking to Come what dye say

 Arac Aye pretty ones engage yourselves with us
 If three rude warriors affright you not

 Hilar Old as you are Id wring your shrivelled neck
 If you were not the Princess Idas father

 Gama If I were not the Princess Idas father
 And so had not her brothers for my sons
 No doubt youd wring my neck  in safety too
 Come come Hilarion begin begin
 Give them no quarter  they will give you none
 Youve this advantage over warriors
 Who kill their countrys enemies for pay
 You know what you are fighting for  look there
 Pointing to Ladies on the
 battlements

 Exit Gamma Hilarion Florian and Cyril
 are led off

 SONG Arac Guron Scynthius and Chorus
 This Helmet I Suppose

 Arac This helmet I suppose
 Was meant to ward off blows
 Its very hot
 And weighs a lot
 As many a guardsman knows
 As many a guardsman knows
 As many a guardsman knows
 As many a guardsman knows
 So off so off that helmet goes

 Others Yes yes yes
 So off that helmet goes

 Giving their helmets to
 attendants

 Arac This tightfitting cuirass
 Is but a useless mass
 Its made of steel
 And weighs a deal
 This tightfitting cuirass
 Is but a useless mass
 A man is but an ass
 Who fights in a cuirass
 So off so off goes that cuirass

 Others Yes yes yes
 So off goes that cuirass
 Removing
 cuirasses

 Arac These brassets truth to tell
 May look uncommon well
 But in a fight
 Theyre much too tight
 Theyre like a lobster shell
 Theyre like a lobster shell

 Others Yes yes yes
 Theyre like a lobster shell
 Removing
 their brassets

 Arac These things I treat the same
 indicating leg pieces
 I quite forget their name
 They turn ones legs
 To cribbage pegs
 Their aid I thus disclaim
 Their aid I thus disclaim
 Though I forget their name
 Though I forget their name
 Their aid their aid I thus disclaim

 Others Yes yes yes
 All Their aid wethey thus disclaim

 They remove their leg pieces and wear closefitting shape suits

 Enter Hilarion Florian and Cyril

 Desperate fight between the three Princes
 and the three
 Knights during which the Ladies on the
 battlements and
 the Soldiers on the stage sing the
 following chorus

 CHORUS DURING THE FIGHT
 This is our Duty

 Chorus This is our duty plain towards
 Our Princess all immaculate
 We ought to bless her brothers swords
 And piously ejaculate
 Oh Hungary
 Oh Hungary
 Oh doughty sons of Hungary
 May all success
 Attend and bless
 Your warlike ironmongery

 Hilarion Hilarion Hilarion

 By this time Arac Guron and
 Scynthius are
 on the ground wounded 
 Hilarion Cyril and
 Florian stand
 over them

 Princess Entering through gate and followed by Ladies
 Hildebrand and Gama
 Hold stay your hands  we yield ourselves to you
 Ladies my brothers all lie bleeding there
 Bind up their wounds  but look the other way
 Coming down Is this the end Bitterly to Lady
 Blanche
 How say you Lady Blanche
 Can I with dignity my post resign
 And if I do will you then take my place

 Blanche To answer this its meet that we consult
 The great Potential Mysteries I mean
 The five Subjunctive Possibilities
 The May the Might the Would the Could the Should
 Can you resign The Prince May claim you if
 He Might you Could  and if you Should I Would

 Princess I thought as much Then to my fate I yield
 So ends my cherished scheme Oh I had hoped
 To band all women with my maiden throng
 And make them all abjure tyrannic Man

 Hildebd A noble aim

 Princess You ridicule it now
 But if I carried out this glorious scheme
 At my exalted name Posterity
 Would bow in gratitude

 Hildebd But pray
 reflect 
 If you enlist all women in your cause
 And make them all abjure tyrannic Man
 The obvious question then arises How
 Is this Posterity to be provided

 Princess I never thought of that My Lady Blanche
 How do you solve the riddle

 Blanche Dont ask me 
 Abstract Philosophy wont answer it
 Take him  he is your Shall Give in to Fate

 Princess And you desert me I alone am staunch

 Hilarion Madam you placed your trust in Woman  well
 Woman has failed you utterly  try Man
 Give him one chance its only fair  besides
 Women are far too precious too divine
 To try unproven theories upon
 Experiments the proverb says are made
 On humble subjects  try our grosser clay
 And mould it as you will

 Cyril Remember too
 Dear Madam if at any time you feel
 Aweary of the Prince you can return
 To Castle Adamant and rule your girls
 As heretofore you know

 Princess And shall I find
 The Lady Psyche here

 Psyche If Cyril maam
 Does not behave himself I think you will

 Princess And you Melissa shall I find you here

 Melissa Madam however Florian turns out
 Unhesitatingly I answer No

 Gama Consider this my love if your mama
 Had looked on matters from your point of view
 I wish she had why where would you have been

 Blanche Theres an unbounded field of speculation
 On which I could discourse for hours

 Princess No doubt
 We will not trouble you Hilarion
 I have been wrong  I see my error now
 Take me Hilarion  We will walk this world
 Yoked in all exercise of noble end
 And so through those dark gates across the wild
 That no one knows Indeed I love thee  Come

 Finale
 With joy abiding

 Princess With joy abiding
 Together gliding
 Through lifes variety
 In sweet society
 And thus enthroning
 The love Im owning
 On this atoning
 I will rely

 Chorus It were profanity
 For poor humanity
 To treat as vanity
 The sway of Love
 In no locality
 Or principality
 Is our mortality
 Its sway above

 Hilarion When day is fading
 With serenading
 And such frivolity
 Of tender quality
 With scented showers
 Of fairest flowers
 The happy hours
 Will gaily fly
 The happy hours will gaily fly

 Chorus It were profanity
 For poor humanity
 To treat as vanity
 The sway of Love
 In no locality
 Or principality
 Is our mortality
 Its sway above

 1st Sops In no lo Others

 SCENE The fishing village of Rederring in Cornwall Rose
 Maybuds cottage is seen L

 Enter Chorus of Bridesmaids They range themselves in front of
 Roses cottage

 CHORUS OF BRIDESMAIDS

 Fair is Rose as bright Mayday
 Soft is Rose as the warm westwind
 Sweet is Rose as the newmown hay
 Rose is queen of maidenkind
 Rose all glowing
 With virgin blushes say
 Is anybody going
 To marry you today

 SOLOZORAH

 Every day as the days roll on
 Bridesmaids garb we gaily don
 Sure that a maid so fairly famed
 Cant long remain unclaimed
 Hour by hour and day by day
 Several months have passed away
 Though shes the fairest flower that blows
 No one has married Rose

 CHORUS

 Rose all glowing
 With virgin blushes say
 Is anybody going
 To marry you today

 ZORAH Hour by hour and day by day
 Months have passed away

 CHORUS Fair is Rose as bright Mayday etc

 Enter Dame Hannah from cottage

 HANNAH Nay gentle maidens you sing well but vainly for
 Rose is still heartfree and looks but coldly upon her many
 suitors
 ZORAH Its very disappointing Every young man in the
 village is in love with her but they are appalled by her beauty
 and modesty and wont declare themselves so until she makes
 her own choice theres no chance for anybody else
 RUTH This is perhaps the only village in the world that
 possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are
 bound to be on duty every day from ten to fourand it is at
 least six months since our services were required The pious
 charity by which we exist is practically wasted
 ZOR We shall be disendowedthat will be the end of it
 Dame Hannahyoure a nice old personyou could marry if you
 liked Theres old AdamRobins faithful servanthe loves you
 with all the frenzy of a boy of fourteen
 HAN Naythat may never be for I am pledged
 ALL To whom
 HAN To an eternal maidenhood Many years ago I was
 betrothed to a godlike youth who wood me under an assumed name
 But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been
 celebrated I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic
 Murgatroyd one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore and the uncle
 of the man who now bears that title As a son of that accursed
 race he was no husband for an honest girl so madly as I loved
 him I left him then and there He died but ten years since but
 I never saw him again
 ZOR But why should you not marry a bad Baronet of
 Ruddigore
 RUTH All baronets are bad but was he worse than other
 baronets
 HAN My child he was accursed
 ZOR But who cursed him Not you I trust
 HAN The curse is on all his line and has been ever since
 the time of Sir Rupert the first Baronet Listen and you shall
 hear the legend

 LEGENDHANNAH

 Sir Rupert Murgatroyd
 His leisure and his riches
 He ruthlessly employed
 In persecuting witches
 With fear hed make them quake
 Hed duck them in his lake
 Hed break their bones
 With sticks and stones
 And burn them at the stake

 CHORUS This sport he much enjoyed
 Did Rupert Murgatroyd
 No sense of shame
 Or pity came
 To Rupert Murgatroyd

 Once on the village green
 A palsied hag he roasted
 And what took place I ween
 Shook his composure boasted
 For as the torture grim
 Seized on each withered limb
 The writhing dame
 Mid fire and flame
 Yelled forth this curse on him

 Each lord of Ruddigore
 Despite his best endeavour
 Shall do one crime or more
 Once every day for ever
 This doom he cant defy
 However he may try
 For should he stay
 His hand that day
 In torture he shall die

 The prophecy came true
 Each heir who held the title
 Had every day to do
 Some crime of import vital
 Until with guilt oerplied
 Ill Sin no more he cried
 And on the day
 He said that say
 In agony he died

 CHORUS And thus with sinning cloyed
 Has died each Murgatroyd
 And so shall fall
 Both one and all
 Each coming Murgatroyd

 Exeunt Chorus of Bridesmaids

 Enter Rose Maybud from cottage with small basket on her arm

 HAN Whither away dear Rose On some errand of charity
 as is thy wont
 ROSE A few gifts dear aunt for deserving villagers Lo
 here is some peppermint rock for old gaffer Gadderby a set of
 false teeth for pretty little Ruth Rowbottom and a pound of
 snuff for the poor orphan girl on the hill
 HAN Ah Rose pity that so much goodness should not help
 to make some gallant youth happy for life Rose why dost thou
 harden that little heart of thine Is there none hereaway whom
 thou couldst love
 ROSE And if there were such an one verily it would ill
 become me to tell him so
 HAN Nay dear one where true love is there is little
 need of prim formality
 ROSE Hush dear aunt for thy words pain me sorely Hung
 in a plated dishcover to the knocker of the workhouse door with
 naught that I could call mine own save a change of babylinen
 and a book of etiquette little wonder if I have always regarded
 that work as a voice from a parents tomb This hallowed volume
 producing a book of etiquette composed if I may believe the
 titlepage by no less an authority than the wife of a Lord
 Mayor has been through life my guide and monitor By its
 solemn precepts I have learnt to test the moral worth of all who
 approach me The man who bites his bread or eats peas with a
 knife I look upon as a lost creature and he who has not
 acquired the proper way of entering and leaving a room is the
 object of my pitying horror There are those in this village who
 bite their nails dear aunt and nearly all are wont to use their
 pocket combs in public places In truth I could pursue this
 painful theme much further but behold I have said enough
 HAN But is there not one among them who is faultless in
 thine eyes For exampleyoung Robin He combines the manners
 of a Marquis with the morals of a Methodist Couldst thou not
 love him
 ROSE And even if I could how should I confess it unto
 him For lo he is shy and sayeth naught

 BALLADROSE

 If somebody there chanced to be
 Who loved me in a manner true
 My heart would point him out to me
 And I would point him out to you
 Referring But here it says of those who point
 to book Their manners must be out of joint
 You may not point
 You must not point
 Its manners out of joint to point

 Ah Had I the love of such as he
 Some quiet spot hed take me to
 Then he could whisper it to me
 And I could whisper it to you
 Referring But whispering Ive somewhere met
 to book Is contrary to etiquette
 Where can it be Searching book
 Now let me seeFinding reference
 Yes yes
 Its contrary to etiquette

 Showing it to Dame Hannah

 If any wellbred youth I knew
 Polite and gentle neat and trim
 Then I would hint as much to you
 And you could hint as much to him
 Referring But here it says in plainest print
 to book Its most unladylike to hint
 You may not hint
 You must not hint
 It says you mustnt hint in print

 Ah And if I loved him through and through
 True love and not a passing whim
 Then I could speak of it to you
 And you could speak of it to him
 Referring But here I find it doesnt do
 to book To speak until youre spoken to
 Where can it be Searching book
 Now let me seeFinding reference
 Yes yes
 Dont speak until youre spoken to
 Exit Dame Hannah

 ROSE Poor aunt Little did the good soul think when she
 breathed the hallowed name of Robin that he would do even as
 well as another But he resembleth all the youths in this
 village in that he is unduly bashful in my presence and lo it
 is hard to bring him to the point But soft he is here

 Rose is about to go when Robin enters and calls her

 ROBIN Mistress Rose
 ROSE Surprised Master Robin
 ROB I wished to say thatit is fine
 ROSE It is passing fine
 ROB But we do want rain
 ROSE Aye sorely Is that all
 ROB Sighing That is all
 ROSE Good day Master Robin
 ROB Good day Mistress Rose Both goingboth stop
 ROSE I crave pardon I
 ROB I beg pardon I
 ROSE You were about to say
 ROB I would fain consult you
 ROSE Truly
 ROB It is about a friend
 ROSE In truth I have a friend myself
 ROB Indeed I mean of course
 ROSE And I would fain consult you

 life I fled my home and concealed myself in this innocent
 village under the name of Robin Oakapple My younger brother
 Despard believing me to be dead succeeded to the title and its
 attendant curse For twenty years I have been dead and buried
 Dont dig me up now
 ADAM Dear master it shall be as you wish for have I not
 sworn to obey you for ever in all things Yet as we are here
 alone and as I belong to that particular description of good old
 man to whom the truth is a refreshing novelty let me call you by
 your own right title once more Robin assents Sir Ruthven

 SONGROBIN

 My boy you may take it from me
 That of all the afflictions accurst
 With which a mans saddled
 And hampered and addled
 A diffident natures the worst
 Though clever as clever can be
 A Crichton of early romance
 You must stir it and stump it
 And blow your own trumpet
 Or trust me you havent a chance

 If you wish in the world to advance
 Your merits youre bound to enhance
 You must stir it and stump it
 And blow your own trumpet
 Or trust me you havent a chance

 Now take for example my case
 Ive a bright intellectual brain
 In all London city
 Theres no one so witty
 Ive thought so again and again
 Ive a highly intelligent face
 My features cannot be denied
 But whatever I try sir
 I fail inand why sir
 Im modesty personified

 If you wish in the world to advance etc

 As a poet Im tender and quaint
 Ive passion and fervour and grace
 From Ovid and Horace
 To Swinburne and Morris
 They all of them take a back place
 Then I sing and I play and I paint
 Though none are accomplished as I
 To say so were treason
 You ask me the reason
 Im diffident modest and shy

 If you wish in the world to advance etc

 Who uprising from their beds
 Hold on high their shameless heads
 With their pretty lips apouting

 That for Cytherean posies
 He would gather aught but roses

 In a nest of weeds and nettles
 Lay a violet halfhidden
 Hoping that his glance unbidden
 Yet might fall upon her petals
 Though she lived alone apart
 Hope lay nestling at her heart
 But alas the cruel awaking
 Set her little heart abreaking
 For he gathered for his posies
 Only rosesonly roses

 commit his daily crime But ha ha I am even with them
 Mysteriously I get my crime over the first thing in the
 morning and then ha ha for the rest of the day I do goodI

 a child and built an orphan asylum Yesterday I robbed a bank
 and endowed a bishopric Today I carry off Rose Maybud and

 That can never never cloy

 ROSE Richard of him I love bereft
 Through thy design
 Thou art the only one thats left
 So I am thine They embrace

 BRIDESMAIDS

 Hail the Bridegroomhail the Bride
 Let the nuptial knot be tied

 DUETROSE and RICHARD

 Oh happy the lily
 When kissed by the bee
 And sipping tranquilly
 Quite happy is he
 And happy the filly
 That neighs in her pride
 But happier than any
 A pound to a penny
 A lover is when he
 Embraces his bride

 DUETSIR DESPARD and MARGARET

 Oh happy the flowers
 That blossom in June
 And happy the bowers
 That gain by the boon
 But happier by hours
 The man of descent
 Who folly regretting
 Is bent on forgetting
 His bad baronetting
 And means to repent

 TRIOHANNAH ADAM and ZORAH

 Oh happy the blossom
 That blooms on the lea
 Likewise the opossum
 That sits on a tree
 But when you come across em
 They cannot compare
 With those who are treading
 The dance at a wedding
 While people are spreading
 The best of good fare

 SOLOROBIN

 Oh wretched the debtor
 Whos signing a deed
 And wretched the letter
 That no one can read
 But very much better
 Their lot it must be
 Than that of the person
 Im making this verse on
 Whose head theres a curse on
 Alluding to me

 Repeat ensemble with Chorus

 Dance

 At the end of the dance Robin falls senseless on the stage

 marriage Poison their beer
 ROB Nonot thatI know Im a bad Bart but Im not as
 bad a Bart as all that
 ADAM Well there you are you see Its no use my making
 suggestions if you dont adopt them
 ROB melodramatically How would it be do you think
 were I to lure him here with cunning wilebind him with good
 stout rope to yonder postand then by making hideous faces at
 him curdle the heartblood in his arteries and freeze the very
 marrow in his bones How say you Adam is not the scheme well
 planned
 ADAM It would be simply rudenothing more But

 Adam and Robin retire up as Richard and Rose enter preceded by
 Chorus of Bridesmaids

 DUETRICHARD and ROSE

 RICH Happily coupled are we
 You see
 I am a jolly Jack Tar
 My star
 And you are the fairest
 The richest and rarest
 Of innocent lasses you are
 By far
 Of innocent lasses you are
 Fanned by a favouring gale
 Youll sail
 Over lifes treacherous sea
 With me
 And as for bad weather
 Well brave it together
 And you shall creep under my lee
 My wee
 And you shall creep under my lee
 For you are such a smart little craft
 Such a neat little sweet little craft
 Such a bright little tight little
 Slight little light little
 Trim little prim little craft

 CHORUS For she is such etc

 ROSE My hopes will be blighted I fear
 My dear
 In a month youll be going to sea
 Quite free
 And all of my wishes
 Youll throw to the fishes
 As though they were never to be
 Poor me
 As though they were never to be
 And I shall be left all alone
 To moan
 And weep at your cruel deceit
 Complete
 While youll be asserting
 Your freedom by flirting
 With every woman you meet
 You cheatAh
 With every woman you meet Ah

 Though I am such a smart little craft
 Such a neat little sweet little craft
 Such a bright little tight little
 Slight little light little
 Trim little prim little craft

 this glorious rag floats over Rose Maybuds head the man does
 not live who would dare to lay unlicensed hand upon her
 ROB Foiledand by a Union Jack But a time will come
 and then
 ROSE Nay let me plead with him To Robin Sir Ruthven
 have pity In my book of etiquette the case of a maiden about to
 be wedded to one who unexpectedly turns out to be a baronet with
 a curse on him is not considered Time was when you loved me
 madly Prove that this was no selfish love by according your
 consent to my marriage with one who if he be not you yourself
 is the next best thingyour dearest friend

 BALLADROSE

 In bygone days I had thy love
 Thou hadst my heart
 But Fate all human vows above

 By the fond heart that beat for thee
 By joys that never now can be
 Grant thou my prayer

 ALL kneeling Grant thou her prayer

 ROB recitative Take herI yield

 BOTH Trim little prim little craft

 CHORUS For she is such a smart little craft etc

 Exeunt all but Robin

 ROB For a week I have fulfilled my accursed doom I have
 duly committed a crime a day Not a great crime I trust but
 still in the eyes of one as strictly regulated as I used to be
 a crime But will my ghostly ancestors be satisfied with what I
 have done or will they regard it as an unworthy subterfuge
 Addressing Pictures Oh my forefathers wallowers in blood
 there came at last a day when sick of crime you each and
 every vowed to sin no more and so in agony called welcome
 Death to free you from your cloying guiltiness Let the sweet
 psalm of that repentant hour soften your longdead hearts and
 tune your souls to mercy on your poor posterity Kneeling

 The stage darkens for a moment It becomes light again and the
 Pictures are seen to have become animated

 CHORUS OF FAMILY PORTRAITS

 Painted emblems of a race
 All accurst in days of yore
 Each from his accustomed place
 Steps into the world once more

 The Pictures step from their frames and march round the stage

 Baronet of Ruddigore
 Last of our accursed line
 Down upon the oaken floor
 Down upon those knees of thine

 Coward poltroon shaker squeamer
 Blockhead sluggard dullard dreamer
 Shirker shuffler crawler creeper
 Sniffler snuffler wailer weeper
 Earthworm maggot tadpole weevil
 Set upon thy course of evil
 Lest the King of Spectreland
 Set on thee his grisly hand

 The Spectre of Sir Roderic descends from his frame

 SIR ROD Beware beware beware
 ROB Gaunt vision who art thou
 That thus with icy glare
 And stern relentless brow
 Appearest who knows how

 SIR ROD I am the spectre of the late
 Sir Roderic Murgatroyd
 Who comes to warn thee that thy fate
 Thou canst not now avoid

 ROB Alas poor ghost

 SIR ROD The pity you
 Express for nothing goes
 We spectres are a jollier crew
 Than you perhaps suppose

 CHORUS We spectres are a jollier crew
 Than you perhaps suppose

 SONGSIR RODERIC

 When the night wind howls in the chimney cowls and the bat in
 the moonlight flies
 And inky clouds like funeral shrouds sail over the midnight
 skies
 When the footpads quail at the nightbirds wail and black dogs
 bay at the moon
 Then is the spectres holidaythen is the ghosts highnoon

 CHORUS Ha ha
 Then is the ghosts highnoon

 As the sob of the breeze sweeps over the trees and the mists lie
 low on the fen
 From grey tombstones are gathered the bones that once were women
 and men
 And away they go with a mop and a mow to the revel that ends
 too soon
 For cockcrow limits our holidaythe dead of the nights
 highnoon

 CHORUS Ha ha
 The dead of the nights highnoon

 And then each ghost with his ladyetoast to their churchyard beds
 takes flight
 With a kiss perhaps on her lantern chaps and a grisly grim
 goodnight
 Till the welcome knell of the midnight bell rings forth its
 jolliest tune
 And ushers in our next high holidaythe dead of the nights
 highnoon

 CHORUS Ha ha
 The dead of the nights highnoon
 Ha ha ha ha

 ROB I recognize you nowyou are the picture that hangs at
 the end of the gallery
 SIR ROD In a bad light I am
 ROB Are you considered a good likeness
 SIR ROD Pretty well Flattering
 ROB Because as a work of art you are poor
 SIR ROD I am crude in colour but I have only been painted
 ten years In a couple of centuries I shall be an Old Master
 and then you will be sorry you spoke lightly of me
 ROB And may I ask why you have left your frames
 SIR ROD It is our duty to see that our successors commit
 their daily crimes in a conscientious and workmanlike fashion
 It is our duty to remind you that you are evading the conditions
 under which you are permitted to exist
 ROB Really I dont know what youd have Ive only been
 a bad baronet a week and Ive committed a crime punctually every
 day
 SIR ROD Let us inquire into this Monday
 ROB Monday was a Bank Holiday

 SIR ROD I see But I dont think you can do that
 ROB My good sir if I cant disinherit my own unborn son
 whose unborn son can I disinherit
 SIR ROD Humph These arguments sound very well but I
 cant help thinking that if they were reduced to syllogistic
 form they wouldnt hold water Now quite understand us We are
 foggy but we dont permit our fogginess to be presumed upon
 Unless you undertake towell suppose we say carry off a lady
 Addressing Ghosts Those who are in favour of his carrying off
 a lady All hold up their hands except a Bishop Those of the
 contrary opinion Bishop holds up his hands Oh youre never
 satisfied Yes unless you undertake to carry off a lady at
 onceI dont care what ladyany ladychoose your ladyyou

 ROB Carry off a lady Certainly not on any account
 Ive the greatest respect for ladies and I wouldnt do anything
 of the kind for worlds No no Im not that kind of baronet I

 back to your frames
 SIR ROD Very goodthen let the agonies commence

 Ghosts make passes Robin begins to writhe in agony

 ROB Oh Oh Dont do that I cant stand it
 SIR ROD Painful isnt it It gets worse by degrees
 ROB OhOh Stop a bit Stop it will you I want to

 Sir Roderic makes signs to Ghosts who resume their attitudes

 SIR ROD Better

 CHORUS

 He yields He answers to our call
 We do not ask for more

 Who dare our wills defy
 We want your pardon ere we go
 For having agonized you so
 So pardon us
 So pardon us
 So pardon us
 Or die

 ROB I pardon you
 I pardon you

 ALL He pardons us
 Hurrah

 The Ghosts return to their frames

 CHORUS Painted emblems of a race
 All accurst in days of yore
 Each to his accustomed place
 Steps unwillingly once more

 By this time the Ghosts have changed to pictures again Robin
 is overcome by emotion

 Enter Adam

 Exeunt Adam

 RECIT and SONGROBIN

 Away Remorse
 Compunction hence
 Go Moral Force
 Go Penitence
 To Virtues plea
 A long farewell
 Propriety
 I ring your knell
 Come guiltiness of deadliest hue
 Come desperate deeds of derringdo

 Henceforth all the crimes that I find in the Times
 Ive promised to perpetrate daily
 Tomorrow I start with a petrified heart
 On a regular course of Old Bailey
 Theres confidence tricking bad coin pocketpicking
 And several other disgraces
 Theres postagestamp prigging and then thimblerigging
 The threecard delusion at races
 Oh A baronets rank is exceedingly nice
 But the titles uncommonly dear at the price

 Ye welltodo squires who live in the shires
 Where petty distinctions are vital
 Who found Athenaeums and local museums
 With a view to a baronets title
 Ye butchers and bakers and candlestick makers
 Who sneer at all things that are tradey
 Whose middleclass lives are embarrassed by wives
 Who long to parade as My Lady
 Oh allow me to offer a word of advice
 The titles uncommonly dear at the price

 Ye supple MPs who go down on your knees
 Your precious identity sinking
 And vote black or white as your leaders indite
 Which saves you the trouble of thinking
 For your countrys good fame her repute or her shame
 You dont care the snuff of a candle
 But youre paid for your game when youre told that your name
 Will be graced by a baronets handle
 Oh Allow me to give you a word of advice
 The titles uncommonly dear at the price

 ROB My eyes are fully open to my awful situation
 I shall go at once to Roderic and make him an oration
 I shall tell him Ive recovered my forgotten moral senses
 And I dont care twopencehalfpenny for any consequences
 Now I do not want to perish by the sword or by the dagger
 But a martyr may indulge a little pardonable swagger

 ALL So it really doesnt matter matter matter matter matter

 MAR If were not a little mad and generally silly
 I should give you my advice upon the subject willynilly

 question
 And youd really be astonished at the force of my
 suggestion
 On the subject I shall write you a most valuable letter
 Full of excellent suggestions when I feel a little better
 But at present Im afraid I am as mad as any hatter
 So Ill keep em to myself for my opinion doesnt matter

 DES Her opinion doesnt matter

 ROB Her opinion doesnt matter

 ALL Her opinion doesnt matter matter matter matter

 DES If I had been so lucky as to have a steady brother
 Who could talk to me as we are talking now to one another
 Who could give me good advice when he discovered I was
 erring
 Which is just the very favour which on you I am
 conferring
 My story would have made a rather interesting idyll
 And I might have lived and died a very decent indiwiddle
 This particularly rapid unintelligible patter
 Isnt generally heard and if it is it doesnt matter

 ROB Dame Hannah This isthis is not what I expected
 HAN Well sir and what would you with me Oh you have

 HAN Bah I am not to be tricked by smooth words
 hypocrite But be warned in time for there are without a
 hundred gallant hearts whose trusty blades would hack him limb
 from limb who dared to lay unholy hands on old Stephen Trustys
 daughter
 ROB And this is what it is to embark upon a career of
 unlicensed pleasure

 Dame Hannah who has taken a formidable dagger from one of the
 armed figures throws her small dagger to Robin

 poor prisoner but if you think I cannot take care of myself you
 are very much mistaken Now then its one to one and let the

 BALLADDAME HANNAH

 There grew a little flower
 Neath a great oak tree
 When the tempest gan to lower
 Little heeded she
 No need had she to cower
 For she dreaded not its power
 She was happy in the bower
 Of her great oak tree
 Sing hey
 Lackaday
 Let the tears fall free
 For the pretty little flower
 And the great oak tree

 BOTH Sing hey
 Lackaday etc

 When she found that he was fickle
 Was that great oak tree
 She was in a pretty pickle
 As she well might be
 But his gallantries were mickle
 For Death followed with his sickle
 And her tears began to trickle
 For her great oak tree
 Sing hey
 Lackaday etc

 BOTH Sing hey
 Lackaday etc

 Said she He loved me never
 Did that great oak tree
 But Im neither rich nor clever
 And so why should he
 But though fate our fortunes sever
 To be constant Ill endeavour
 Aye for ever and for ever
 To my great oak tree
 Sing hey
 Lackaday etc

 BOTH Sing hey
 Lackaday etc

 Falls weeping on Sir Roderics bosom

 Enter Robin excitedly followed by all the characters and Chorus
 of Bridesmaids

 ROB Stop a bitboth of you
 ROD This intrusion is unmannerly
 HAN Im surprised at you
 ROB I cant stop to apologizean idea has just occurred
 to me A Baronet of Ruddigore can only die through refusing to
 commit his daily crime
 ROD No doubt
 ROB Therefore to refuse to commit a daily crime is
 tantamount to suicide
 ROD It would seem so
 ROB But suicide is itself a crimeand so by your own
 showing you ought never to have died at all
 ROD I seeI understand Then Im practically alive
 ROB Undoubtedly Sir Roderic embraces Dame Hannah Rose
 when you believed that I was a simple farmer I believe you loved
 me
 ROSE Madly passionately
 ROB But when I became a bad baronet you very properly
 loved Richard instead
 ROSE Passionately madly
 ROB But if I should turn out not to be a bad baronet after
 all how would you love me then
 ROSE Madly passionately
 ROB As before
 ROSE Why of course
 ROB My darling They embrace
 RICH Here I say belay
 ROSE Oh sir belay if its absolutely necessary
 ROB Belay Certainly not

 FINALE

 ROB Having been a wicked baronet a week
 Once again a modest livelihood I seek
 Agricultural employment
 Is to me a keen enjoyment
 For Im naturally diffident and meek

 ROSE When a man has been a naughty baronet
 And expresses deep repentance and regret
 You should help him if youre able
 Like the mousie in the fable
 Thats the teaching of my Book of Etiquette

 CHORUS Thats the teaching in her Book of Etiquette

 RICH If you ask me why I do not pipe my eye
 Like an honest British sailor I reply
 That with Zorah for my missis
 Therell be bread and cheese and kisses
 Which is just the sort of ration I enjye

 CHORUS Which is just the sort of ration you enjye

 DES and MAR Prompted by a keen desire to evoke
 All the blessed calm of matrimonys yoke
 We shall toddle off tomorrow
 From this scene of sin and sorrow
 For to settle in the town of Basingstoke

 ALL For happy the lily
 Thats kissed by the bee
 And sipping tranquilly
 Quite happy is he
 And happy the filly
 That neighs in her pride
 But happier than any
 A pound to a penny
 A lover is when he
 Embraces his bride

 I sigh with grief
 My hopeless fear
 No soul can measure
 His love alone
 Can give my aching heart relief

 When he is cold
 I weep for sorrow
 When he is kind
 I weep for joy
 My grief untold
 Knows no tomorrow
 My woe can find
 No hope no solace no alloy

 MRS P Come tell me all about it Do not fear
 I too have loved but that was long ago
 Who is the object of your young affections
 CONST Hush mother He is here Looking off

 Enter Dr Daly He is pensive and does not see them

 The air is charged with amatory numbers
 Soft madrigals and dreamy lovers lays
 Peace peace old heart Why waken from its slumbers
 The aching memory of the old old days

 BALLAD

 Time was when Love and I were well acquainted
 Time was when we walked ever hand in hand
 A saintly youth with worldly thought untainted
 None betterloved than I in all the land
 Time was when maidens of the noblest station
 Forsaking even military men
 Would gaze upon me rapt in adoration
 Ah me I was a fair young curate then

 Had I a headache sighed the maids assembled
 Had I a cold welled forth the silent tear
 Did I look pale then half a parish trembled
 And when I coughed all thought the end was near
 I had no careno jealous doubts hung oer me
 For I was loved beyond all other men
 Fled gilded dukes and belted earls before me
 Ah me I was a pale young curate them

 At the conclusion of the ballad Mrs Partlet comes forward with
 Constance

 MRS P Good day reverend sir
 DR D Ah good Mrs Partlet I am glad to see you And
 your little daughter Constance Why she is quite a little
 woman I declare
 CONST aside Oh mother I cannot speak to him
 MRS P Yes reverend sir she is nearly eighteen and as
 good a girl as ever stepped Aside to Dr Daly Ah sir Im

 much Is she delicate
 MRS P Oh no sirI dont mean thatbut young girls look

 DR D Oh I take you To be sure But theres plenty of
 time for that Four or five years hence Mrs Partlet four or
 five years hence But when the time does come I shall have much
 pleasure in marrying her myself
 CONST aside Oh mother
 DR D To some strapping young fellow in her own rank of
 life
 CONST in tears He does not love me
 MRS P I have often wondered reverend sir if youll
 excuse the liberty that you have never married
 DR D aside Be still my fluttering heart
 MRS P A clergymans wife does so much good in a village
 besides that you are not as young as you were and before very
 long you will want somebody to nurse you and look after your
 little comforts
 DR D Mrs Partlet there is much truth in what you say
 I am indeed getting on in years and a helpmate would cheer my
 declining days Time was when it might have been but I have
 left it too longI am an old fogy now am I not my dear to
 Constancea very old fogy indeed Ha ha No Mrs Partlet

 bachelor
 CONST Oh mother mother Sobs on Mrs Partlets bosom

 fitting time we will try againwe will try again
 Exeunt Mrs Partlet and
 Constance

 DR D Sir Marmadukemy dear young friend Alexis
 On this most happy most auspicious plighting
 Permit me as a true old friend to tender
 My best my very best congratulations
 SIR M Sir you are most obleeging
 ALEX Dr Daly
 My dear old tutor and my valued pastor
 I thank you from the bottom of my heart
 Spoken
 through music
 DR D May fortune bless you may the middle distance
 Of your young life be pleasant as the foreground
 The joyous foreground and when you have reached it
 May that which now is the faroff horizon
 But which will then become the middle distance
 In fruitful promise be exceeded only
 By that which will have opened in the meantime
 Into a new and glorious horizon
 SIR M Dear Sir that is an excellent example
 Of an old school of stately compliment
 To which I have through life been much addicted
 Will you obleege me with a copy of it
 In clerkly manuscript that I myself
 May use it on appropriate occasions

 Ere Sol has sunk into his western slumbers

 SIR M Alexis I desire that of your love for this young
 lady you do not speak so openly You are always singing ballads
 in praise of her beauty and you expect the very menials who wait
 behind your chair to chorus your ecstasies It is not delicate
 ALEXIS Father a man who loves as I love
 SIR M Pooh pooh sir fifty years ago I madly loved your
 future motherinlaw the Lady Sangazure and I have reason to
 believe that she returned my love But were we guilty of the
 indelicacy of publicly rushing into each others arms
 exclaiming

 Oh my adored one Beloved boy
 Ecstatic rapture Unmingled joy

 which seems to be the modern fashion of lovemaking No it was
 Madam I trust you are in the enjoyment of good healthSir

 Chase the clouds of care away
 Irresistible incentive
 Bids me humbly kiss your hand
 Im your service most attentive
 Most attentive to command

 Aside with frantic vehemence
 Wild with adoration
 Mad with fascination
 To indulge my lamentation

 CHO With heart and with voice
 Let us welcome this mating
 Leave them here to rejoice
 With true love palpitating
 Alexis the brave
 And the lovely Aline
 Exeunt all but Alexis
 and Aline

 ALEXIS At last we are alone My darling you are now
 irrevocably betrothed to me Are you not very very happy
 ALINE Oh Alexis can you doubt it Do I not love you
 beyond all on earth and am I not beloved in return Is not true
 love faithfully given and faithfully returned the source of
 every earthly joy
 ALEXIS Of that there can be no doubt Oh that the world
 could be persuaded of the truth of that maxim Oh that the
 world would break down the artificial barriers of rank wealth
 education age beauty habits taste and temper and recognize
 the glorious principle that in marriage alone is to be found the
 panacea for every ill
 ALINE Continue to preach that sweet doctrine and you will
 succeed oh evangel of true happiness
 ALEXIS I hope so but as yet the cause progresses but
 slowly Still I have made some converts to the principle that
 men and women should be coupled in matrimony without distinction
 of rank I have lectured on the subject at Mechanics
 Institutes and the mechanics were unanimous in favour of my
 views I have preached in workhouses beershops and Lunatic
 Asylums and I have been received with enthusiasm I have
 addressed navvies on the advantages that would accrue to them if
 they married wealthy ladies of rank and not a navvy dissented
 ALINE Noble fellows And yet there are those who hold that
 the uneducated classes are not open to argument And what do the
 countesses say
 ALEXIS Why at present it cant be denied the aristocracy
 hold aloof
 ALINE Ah the working man is the true Intelligence after
 all
 ALEXIS He is a noble creature when he is quite sober Yes
 Aline true happiness comes of true love and true love should be
 independent of external influences It should live upon itself
 and by itselfin itself love should live for love alone

 BALLADALEXIS

 Love feeds on many kinds of food I know
 Some love for rank some for duty
 Some give their hearts away for empty show
 And others for youth and beauty
 To love for money all the world is prone
 Some love themselves and live all lonely
 Give me the love that loves for love alone
 I love that loveI love it only

 What man for any other joy can thirst
 Whose loving wife adores him duly
 Want misery and care may do their worst
 If loving woman loves you truly
 A lovers thoughts are ever with his own
 None truly loved is ever lonely
 Give me the love that loves for love alone
 I love that loveI love it only

 ALINE Oh Alexis those are noble principles
 ALEXIS Yes Aline and I am going to take a desperate step
 in support of them Have you ever heard of the firm of J W
 Wells  Co the oldestablished Family Sorcerers in St Mary
 Axe
 ALINE I have seen their advertisement
 ALEXIS They have invented a philtre which if report may
 be believed is simply infallible I intend to distribute it
 through the village and within half an hour of my doing so there
 will not be an adult in the place who will not have learnt the
 secret of pure and lasting happiness What do you say to that
 ALINE Well dear of course a filter is a very useful thing
 in a house but still I dont quite see that it is the sort of
 thing that places its possessor on the very pinnacle of earthly
 joy
 ALEXIS Aline you misunderstand me I didnt say a
 filterI said a philtre
 ALINE alarmed You dont mean a lovepotion
 ALEXIS On the contraryI do mean a love potion
 ALINE Oh Alexis I dont think it would be right I
 dont indeed And thena real magician Oh it would be
 downright wicked
 ALEXIS Aline is it or is it not a laudable object to
 steep the whole village up to its lips in love and to couple
 them in matrimony without distinction of age rank or fortune
 ALINE Unquestionably but
 ALEXIS Then unpleasant as it must be to have recourse to
 supernatural aid I must nevertheless pocket my aversion in
 deference to the great and good end I have in view Calling
 Hercules

 Enter a Page from tent

 PAGE Yes sir
 Exit Page
 ALINE Oh but Alexis A real Sorcerer Oh I shall be
 frightened to death
 ALEXIS I trust my Aline will not yield to fear while the
 strong right arm of her Alexis is here to protect her
 ALINE Its nonsense dear to talk of your protecting me
 with your strong right arm in face of the fact that this Family
 Sorcerer could change me into a guineapig before you could turn
 round
 ALEXIS He could change you into a guineapig no doubt but
 it is most unlikely that he would take such a liberty Its a
 most respectable firm and I am sure he would never be guilty of
 so untradesmanlike an act

 Enter Mr Wells from tent

 And for raising a posthumous shade
 With effects that are comic or tragic
 Theres no cheaper house in the trade

 And that without reflectors
 And creepy things
 With wings

 With chains
 And gibberings grim and ghastly

 And then if you plan it he

 Full of Satanity
 Vexes humanity
 With an inanity
 Fatal to vanity
 Driving your foes to the verge of insanity

 ALEXIS I have sent for you to consult you on a very
 important matter I believe you advertise a Patent OxyHydrogen
 Loveatfirstsight Philtre
 WELLS Sir it is our leading article Producing a phial
 ALEXIS Now I want to know if you can confidently guarantee
 it as possessing all the qualities you claim for it in your
 advertisement
 WELLS Sir we are not in the habit of puffing our goods
 Ours is an oldestablished house with a large family connection
 and every assurance held out in the advertisement is fully
 realized Hurt
 ALINE aside Oh Alexis dont offend him Hell change
 us into something dreadfulI know he will
 ALEXIS I am anxious from purely philanthropical motives to
 distribute this philtre secretly among the inhabitants of this
 village I shall of course require a quantity How do you sell
 it
 WELLS In buying a quantity sir we should strongly advise
 your taking it in the wood and drawing it off as you happen to
 want it We have it in fourandahalf and nine gallon
 casksalso in pipes and hogsheads for laying down and we deduct
 10 per cent from prompt cash
 ALEXIS I should mention that I am a Member of the Army and

 Navy Stores
 WELLS In that case we deduct 25 percent
 ALEXIS Aline the villagers will assemble to carouse in a
 few minutes Go and fetch the teapot
 ALINE But Alexis
 ALEXIS My dear you must obey me if you please Go and
 fetch the teapot
 ALINE going Im sure Dr Daly would disapprove of it

 Exit Aline
 ALEXIS And how soon does it take effect
 WELLS In twelve hours Whoever drinks of it loses
 consciousness for that period and on waking falls in love as a
 matter of course with the first lady he meets who has also
 tasted it and his affection is at once returned One trial will
 prove the fact
 Enter Aline with large teapot

 ALEXIS Good then Mr Wells I shall feel obliged if you
 will at once pour as much philtre into this teapot as will
 suffice to affect the whole village
 ALINE But bless me Alexis many of the villages are
 married people
 WELLS Madam this philtre is compounded on the strictest
 principles On married people it has no effect whatever But
 are you quite sure that you have nerve enough to carry you
 through the fearful ordeal
 ALEXIS In the good cause I fear nothing
 WELLS Very good then we will proceed at once to the
 Incantation

 AriaCONSTANCE

 Dear friends take pity on my lot
 My cup is not of nectar
 I long have lovedas who would not
 Our kind and reverend rector
 Long years ago my love began
 So sweetlyyet so sadly
 But when I saw this plain old man
 Away my old affection ran
 I found I loved him madly
 Oh

 To Notary You very very plain old man
 I love I love you madly
 CHORUS You very very plain old man
 She loves she loves you madly
 NOTARY I am a very deaf old man
 And hear you very badly

 CONST I know not why I love him so
 It is enchantment surely
 Hes dry and snuffy deaf and slow
 Illtempered weak and poorly
 Hes ugly and absurdly dressed
 And sixtyseven nearly
 Hes everything that I detest
 But if the truth must be confessed
 I love him very dearly
 Oh

 To Notary Youre everything that I detest
 But still I love you dearly

 CHORUS Youve everything that girls detest
 But still she loves you dearly

 NOTARY I caught that line but for the rest
 I did not hear it clearly

 During this verse Aline and Alexis have entered at back

 lovingly

 ALINE How joyful they all seem in their newfound
 happiness The whole village has paired off in the happiest
 manner And yet not a match has been made that the hollow world
 would not consider illadvised
 ALEXIS But we are wiserfar wiserthan the world
 Observe the good that will become of these illassorted unions
 The miserly wife will check the reckless expenditure of her too
 frivolous consort the wealthy husband will shower innumerable
 bonnets on his penniless bride and the young and lively spouse
 will cheer the declining days of her aged partner with comic
 songs unceasing
 ALINE What a delightful prospect for him
 ALEXIS But one thing remains to be done that my happiness
 may be complete We must drink the philtre ourselves that I may
 be assured of your love for ever and ever
 ALINE Oh Alexis do you doubt me Is it necessary that
 such love as ours should be secured by artificial means Oh no
 no no
 ALEXIS My dear Aline time works terrible changes and I
 want to place our love beyond the chance of change
 ALINE Alexis it is already far beyond that chance Have
 faith in me for my love can never never change
 ALEXIS Then you absolutely refuse
 ALINE I do If you cannot trust me you have no right to
 love meno right to be loved by me
 ALEXIS Enough Aline I shall know how to interpret this
 refusal

 BALLADALEXIS

 Thou hast the power thy vaunted love
 To sanctify all doubt above
 Despite the gathering shade
 To make that love of thine so sure
 That come what may it must endure
 Till time itself shall fade
 They love is but a flower
 That fades within the hour
 If such thy love oh shame
 Call it by other name
 It is not love

 Thine is the power and thine alone
 To place me on so proud a throne
 That kings might envy me
 A priceless throne of love untold
 More rare than orient pearl and gold
 But no Thou wouldst be free
 Such love is like the ray
 That dies within the day
 If such thy love oh shame
 Call it by other name
 It is not love

 to marrying and giving in marriage Hitherto the youths of this
 village have not been enterprising and the maidens have been
 distinctly coy Judge then of my surprise when I tell you that
 the whole village came to me in a body just now and implored me
 to join them in matrimony with as little delay as possible Even
 your excellent father has hinted to me that before very long it
 is not unlikely that he may also change his condition
 ALINE Oh Alexisdo you hear that Are you not delighted
 ALEXIS Yes I confess that a union between your mother and
 my father would be a happy circumstance indeed Crossing to Dr
 Daly My dear sirthe news that you bring us is very
 gratifying
 DR D Yesstill in my eyes it has its melancholy side

 This universal marrying recalls the happy daysnow alas gone
 foreverwhen I myself might havebut tush I am puling I am
 too old to marryand yet within the last halfhour I have
 greatly yearned for companionship I never remarked it before
 but the young maidens of this village are very comely So
 likewise are the middleaged Also the elderly All are
 comelyand with a deep sigh all are engaged
 ALINE Here comes your father

 Enter Sir Marmaduke with Mrs Partlet arminarm

 ALINE and ALEXIS aside Mrs Partlet
 SIR M Dr Daly give me joy Alexis my dear boy you
 will I am sure be pleased to hear that my declining days are
 not unlikely to be solaced by the companionship of this good
 virtuous and amiable woman
 ALEXIS rather taken aback My dear father this is not
 altogether what I expected I am certainly taken somewhat by
 surprise Still it can hardly be necessary to assure you that
 any wife of yours is a mother of mine Aside to Aline It is
 not quite what I could have wished
 MRS P crossing to Alexis Oh sir I entreat your
 forgiveness I am aware that socially I am not everything that
 could be desired nor am I blessed with an abundance of worldly
 goods but I can at least confer on your estimable father the
 great and priceless dowry of a true tender and lovin art
 ALEXIS coldly I do not question it After all a
 faithful love is the true source of every earthly joy
 SIR M I knew that my boy would not blame his poor father
 for acting on the impulse of a heart that has never yet misled
 him Zorah is not perhaps what the world calls beautiful
 DR D Still she is comelydistinctly comely Sighs
 ALINE Zorah is very good and very clean and honest and
 quite quite sober in her habits and that is worth far more than
 beauty dear Sir Marmaduke
 DR D Yes beauty will fade and perish but personal
 cleanliness is practically undying for it can be renewed
 whenever it discovers symptoms of decay My dear Sir Marmaduke
 I heartily congratulate you Sighs

 QUINTETTE

 ALEXIS ALINE SIR MARMADUKE ZORAH and DR DALY

 With the weight of fifty years

 SIR M No highborn exacting beauty
 Blazing like a jewelled sun
 But a wife wholl do her duty
 As that duty should be done

 MRS P Im no saucy minx and giddy

 ACT I  Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus

 ACT II  The same Scene with the Ruins Restored




ACT I

 SceneThe ruins of the The Temple of the Gods on summit of
 Mount Olympus Picturesque shattered columns overgrown with
 ivy etc R and L with entrances to temple ruined R Fallen
 columns on the stage Three broken pillars 2 RE At the back of
 stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain This
 should be practicable to enable large numbers of people to
 ascend and descend In the distance are the summits of adjacent
 mountains At first all this is concealed by a thick fog which
 clears presently Enter through fog Chorus of Stars coming off
 duty as fatigued with their nights work

 CHO Through the night the constellations
 Have given light from various stations
 When midnight gloom falls on all nations
 We will resume our occupations

 SOLO Our light its true is not worth mention
 What can we do to gain attention
 When night and noon with vulgar glaring
 A great big moon is always flaring

 During chorus enter Diana an elderly goddess She is carefully
 wrapped up in cloaks shawls etc A hood is over her head a
 respirator in her mouth and galoshes on her feet During the
 chorus she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
 in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana the goddess of the moon

 DIA shuddering Ugh How cold the nights are I dont know how
 it is but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
 used to But it is time for the sun to be rising Calls Apollo

 AP within Hollo

 DIA Ive come off dutyits time for you to be getting up

 Enter Apollo He is an elderly buck with an air of assumed
 juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap

 AP yawning I shant go out today I was out yesterday and the
 day before and I want a little rest I dont know how it isbut I
 seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to

 DIA I am sure these short days cant hurt you Why you dont
 rise til six and youre in bed again by five you should have a
 turn at my work and see how you like thatout all night

 AP My dear sister I dont envy youthough I remember when I
 didbut that was when I was a younger sun I dont think Im
 quite well Perhaps a little change of air will do me good Ive
 a mind to show myself in London this winter Theyll be very glad
 to see me No I shant go out today I shall send them this
 fine thick wholesome fog and they wont miss me Its the best
 substitute for a blazing sunand like most substitutes nothing
 at all like the real thing

 Fog clears away and discovers the scene described Hurried
 music Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
 stage He carries several parcels afterwards described He sits
 down very much fatigued

 MER Home at last A nice time Ive had of it

 DIA You young scamp youve been out all night again This is the
 third time youve been out this week

 MER Well youre a nice one to blow me up for that

 DIA I cant help being out all night

 MER And I cant help being down all night The nature of Mercury
 requires that he should go down when the sun sets and rise again
 when the sun rises

 DIA And what have you been doing

 MER Stealing on commission Theres a set of false teeth and a
 box of Life Pills for Jupiteran invisible peruke and a bottle
 of hair dyethats for Apolloa respirator and a pair of
 galoshesthats for Cupida full bottomed chignon some
 auricomous fluid a box of pearlpowder a pot of rouge and a
 hares footthats for Venus

 DIA Stealing You ought to be ashamed of yourself

 MER Oh as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my
 position

 DIAand AP contemptuously Your position

 MER Oh I know its nothing to boast of even on earth Up here
 its simply contemptible Now that you gods are too old for your
 work youve made me the miserable drudge of Olympusgroom
 valet postman butler commissionaire maid of all work parish
 beadle and original dustman

 AP Your Christmas boxes ought to be something considerable

 MER They ought to be but theyre not Im treated abominably
 I make everybody and Im nobody I go everywhere and Im
 nowhere I do everything and Im nothing Ive made thunder for
 Jupiter odes for Apollo battles for Mars and love for Venus
 Ive married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards Ive
 divorced them for Cupid and in return I get all the kicks while
 they pocket the halfpence And in compensation for robbing me of
 the halfpence in question what have they done for me

 AP Why theyvehahaha theyve made you the god of thieves

 MER Very self denying of them There isnt one of them who
 hasnt a better claim to the distinction than I have

 Oh Im the celestial drudge
 For morning to night I must stop at it
 On errands all day I must trudge
 And stick to my work til I drop at it
 In summer I get up at one
 As a goodnatured donkey Im ranked for it
 then I go and I light up the sun
 And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it
 Well well its the way of the world
 And will be through all its futurity
 Though noodles are baroned and earled
 Theres nothing for clever obscurity

 Im the slave of the Gods neck and heels
 And Im bound to obey though I rate at em
 And I not only order their meals
 But I cook em and serveem and wait at em
 Then I make all their nectar I do
 What a terrible liquor to rack us is
 And whenever I mix them a brew
 Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchuss
 Well well its the way of the world etc

 The reading and writing I teach
 And spellingbooks many Ive edited
 And for bringing those arts within reach
 That donkey Minerva gets credited
 Then I scrape at the stars with a knife
 And platepowder the moon on the days for it
 And I hear all the world and his wife
 Awarding Diana the praise for it
 Well well its the way of the world etc

 After songvery loud and majestic music is heard

 DIA and MER looking off Why whos this Jupiter by Jove

 Enter Jupiter an extremely old man very decrepit with very
 thin straggling white beard he wears a long braided dressing
 gown handsomely trimmed and a silk nightcap on his head
 Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters

 JUP Good day Diana Ah Apollo Well well well whats the
 matter Whats the matter

 DIA Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing and
 leave all the duties of Olympus to him Will you believe it he
 actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
 nil

 JUP Well well Dont be hard on the lad To tell you the
 truth Im not sure that hes far wrong Dont let it go any
 further but between ourselves the sacrifices and votive
 offerings have fallen off terribly of late Why I can remember
 the time when people offered us human sacrifices no mistake
 about it human sacrifices Think of that

 DIA Ah Those good old days

 JUP Then it fell off to oxen pigs and sheep

 AP Well there are worse things than oxen pigs and sheep

 JUP So Ive found to my cost My dear sir between ourselves
 its dropped off from one thing to another until it has
 positively dwindled down to preserved Australian beef What do
 you think of that

 AP I dont like it at all

 JUP You wont mention it It might go further

 DIA It couldnt fare worse

 JUP In short matters have come to such a crisis that theres no
 mistake about itsomething must be done to restore our
 influence the only question is what

 MER Coming forward in great alarm Enter Mars
 Oh incident unprecedented
 I hardly can believe its true

 MARS Why bless the boy hes quite demented
 Why whats the matter sir with you

 AP Speak quickly or youll get a warming

 MER Why mortals up the mount are swarming
 Our temple on Olympus storming
 In hundredsaye in thousands too

 ALL Goodness gracious
 How audacious
 Earth is spacious
 Why come here
 Our impeding
 Their proceeding
 Were good breeding
 That is clear

 DIA Jupiter hear my plea
 Upon the mount if they light
 Therell be an end of me
 I wont be seen by daylight

 AP Tartarus is the place
 These scoundrels you should send to
 Should they behold my face
 My influence theres an end to

 JUP looking over precipice
 What fools to give themselves
 so much exertion

 DIA A government survey Ill make assertion

 AP Perhaps the Alpine clubs their diversion

 MER They seem to be more like a Cooks excursion

 ALL Goodness gracious etc

 AP If mighty Jove you value your existence
 Send them a thunderbolt with your regards

 JUP My thunderbolts though valid at a distance
 Are not effective at a hundred yards

 MER Let the moons rays Diana strike em flighty
 Make em all lunatics in various styles

 DIA My lunar rays unhappily are mighty
 Only at many hundred thousand miles

 ALL Goodness gracious etc

 Exeunt Jupiter Apollo Diana and Mercury into ruined temple

 Enter Sparkeion and Nicemis climbing mountain at back

 SPAR Here we are at last on the very summit and weve left the
 others ever so far behind Why whats this

 NICE A ruined palace A palace on the top of a mountain I
 wonder who lives here Some mighty kind I dare say with wealth
 beyond all counting who came to live up here

 SPAR To avoid his creditors Its a lovely situation for a
 country house though its very much out of repair

 NICE Very inconvenient situation

 SPAR Inconvenient

 NICE Yes how are you to get butter milk and eggs up here No
 pigs no poultry no postman Why I should go mad

 SPAR What a dear little practical mind it is What a wife you
 will make

 NICE Dont be too surewe are only partly marriedthe marriage
 ceremony lasts all day

 SPAR I have no doubt at all about it We shall be as happy as a
 king and queen though we are only a strolling actor and actress

 NICE Its very nice of Thespis to celebrate our marriage day by
 giving the company a picnic on this lovely mountain

 SPAR And still more kind to allow us to get so much ahead of all
 the others Discreet Thespis kissing her

 NICE There now get away do Remember the marriage ceremony
 is not yet completed

 SPAR But it would be ungrateful to Thespiss discretion not to
 take advantage of it by improving the opportunity

 NICE Certainly not get away

 SPAR On second thought the opportunitys so good it dont admit
 of improvement There kisses her

 NICE How dare you kiss me before we are quite married

 SPAR Attribute it to the intoxicating influence of the mountain
 air

 NICE Then we had better do down again It is not right to
 expose ourselves to influences over which we have no control

 SPAR Here far away from all the world
 Dissension and derision
 With Natures wonders all unfurled
 To our delighted vision
 With no one here
 At least in sight
 To interfere
 With our delight
 And two fond lovers sever
 Oh do not free
 Thine hand from mine
 I swear to thee
 My love is ever thine
 For ever and for ever

 NICE On mountain top the air is keen
 And most exhilarating
 And we say things we do not mean
 In moments less elating
 So please to wait
 For thoughts that crop
 En teteatete
 On mountain top
 May not exactly tally
 With those that you
 May entertain
 Returning to
 The sober plain
 Of yon relaxing valley

 SPAR Very wellif you wont have anything to say to me I know
 who will

 NICE Who will

 SPAR Daphne will

 NICE Daphne would flirt with anybody

 SPAR Anybody would flirt with Daphne She is quite as pretty as
 you and has twice as much backhair

 NICE She has twice as much money which may account for it

 SPAR At all events she has appreciation She likes good looks

 NICE We all like what we havent got

 SPAR She keeps her eyes open

 NICE Yesone of them

 SPAR Which one

 NICE The one she doesnt wink with

 SPAR Well I was engaged to her for six months and if she still
 makes eyes at me you must attribute it to force of habit
 Besidesrememberwe are only halfmarried at present

 NICE I suppose you mean that you are going to treat me as
 shamefully as you treated her Very well break it off if you
 like I shall not offer any objection Thespis used to be very
 attentive to me Id just as soon be a managers wife as a fifth
 rate actors

 Chorus heard at first below then enter Daphne Pretteia
 Preposteros Stupidas Tipseion Cymon and other members of
 Thespiss company climbing over rocks at back All carry small
 baskets

 CHO with dance Climbing over rocky mountain
 Skipping rivulet and fountain
 Passing where the willows quiver
 By the ever rolling river
 Swollen with the summer rain
 Threading long and leafy mazes
 Dotted with unnumbered daisies
 Scaling rough and rugged passes
 Climb the hearty lads and lasses
 Til the mountaintop they gain

 FIRST VOICE Fill the cup and tread the measure
 Make the most of fleeting leisure
 Hail it as a true ally
 Though it perish bye and bye

 SECOND VOICE Every moment brings a treasure
 Of its own especial pleasure
 Though the moments quickly die
 Greet them gaily as they fly

 THIRD VOICE Far away from grief and care
 High up in the mountain air
 Let us live and reign alone
 In a world thats all our own

 FOURTH VOICE Here enthroned in the sky
 Far away from mortal eye
 Well be gods and make decrees
 Those may honor them who please

 CHO Fill the cup and tread the measureetc

 I once knew a chap who discharged a function
 On the North South East West Diddlesex Junction
 He was conspicuous exceeding
 For his affable ways and his easy breeding
 Although a chairman of directions
 He was hand in glove with the ticket inspectors
 He tipped the guards with brand new fivers
 And sang little songs to the engine drivers
 Twas told to me with great compunction
 By one who had discharged with unction
 A chairman of directors function
 On the North South East West Diddlesex Junction
 Fol diddle lol diddle lol lol lay

 Each Christmas day he gave each stoker
 A silver shovel and a golden poker
 Hed button holw flowers for the ticket sorters
 And rich Bathbuns for the outside porters
 Hed moun the clerks on his firstclass hunters
 And he build little villas for the roadside shunters
 And if any were fond of pigeon shooting
 Hed ask them down to his place at Tooting
 Twas told to meetc

 In course of time there spread a rumour
 That he did all this from a sense of humour
 So instead of signalling and stoking
 They gave themselves up to a course of joking
 Whenever they knew that he was riding
 They shunted his train on a lonely siding
 Or stopped all night in the middle of a tunnel
 On the plea that the boiler was acoming through the funnel
 Twas told to meetc

 It he wished to go to Perth or Stirling
 His train through several counties whirling
 Would set him down in a fit of larking
 At four am in the wilds of Barking
 This pleased his whim and seemed to strike it
 But the general public did not like it
 The receipts fell after a few repeatings
 And he got it hot at the annual meetings
 Twas told to meetc

 He followed out his whim with vigour
 The shares went down to a nominal figure
 These are the sad results proceeding
 From his affable ways and his easy breeding
 The line with its rais and guards and peelers
 Was sold for a song to marine store dealers
 The shareholders are all in the workus
 And he sells pipelights in the Regent Circus
 Twas told to meetc

 Its very hard As a man I am naturally of an easy disposition
 As a manager I am compelled to hold myself aloof that my
 influence may not be deteriorated As a man I am inclined to
 fraternize with the pauperas a manager I am compelled to walk
 around like this Dont know yah Dont know yah Dont know yah

 Strides haughtily about the stage Jupiter Mars and Apollo in

 At length I will be able to enjoy
 The pleasures I have envied from a distance

 MER Compelled upon Olympus here to stop
 While the other gods go down to play the hero
 Dont be surprised if on this mountain top
 You find your Mercury is down at zero

 AP To earth away to join in mortal acts
 And gather fresh materials to write on
 Investigate more closely several facts
 That I for centuries have thrown some light on

 DIA I as the modest moon with crescent bow
 Have always shown a light to nightly scandal
 I must say Id like to go below
 And find out if the game is worth the candle

 enter all thespians summoned by Mercury

 MER Here come your people

 THES People better now

 THES While mighty Jove goes down below
 With all the other deities
 I fill his place and wear his clo
 The very part for me it is
 To mother earth to make a track
 They are all spurred and booted too
 And you will fill till they come back
 The parts you best are suited to

ACT II

 SCENEthe same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
 of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage the
 interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
 of the scene of Act I through the columns of the portico at the
 back High throne LUE Low seats below it All the substitute
 gods and goddesses that is to say Thespians are discovered
 grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage eating and
 drinking and smoking and singing the following verses

 CHO Of all symposia
 The best by half
 Upon Olympus here await us
 We eat ambrosia
 And nectar quaff
 It cheers but dont inebriate us
 We know the fallacies
 Of human food
 So please to pass Olympian rosy
 We built up palaces
 Where ruins stood
 And find them much more snug and cosy

 SILL To work and think my dear
 Up here would be
 The height of conscientious folly
 So eat and drink my dear
 I like to see
 Young people gayyoung people jolly
 Olympian food my love
 Ill lay long odds
 Will please your lipsthose rosy portals
 What is the good my love
 Of being gods
 If we must work like common mortals

 CHO Of all symposiaetc

 Exeunt all but Nicemis who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia
 who is dressed as Venus They take Sillimons arm and bring him
 down

 SILL Bless their little hearts I can refuse them nothing As
 the Olympian stagemanager I ought to be strict with them and
 make them do their duty but i cant Bless their little hearts
 when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
 wheedling smile on their pretty little figureheads I cant turn
 my back on em Im all bow though Im sure I try to be stern

 PRET You certainly are a dear old thing

 SILL She says Im a dear old thing Deputy Venus says Im a
 dear old thing

 NICE Its her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
 terms I am more particular but still even I am bound to admit
 that you are certainly a very dear old thing

 SILL Deputy Venus says Im a dear old thing and Deputy Diana
 who is much more particular endorses it Who could be severe
 with such deputy divinities

 PRET Do you know Im going to ask you a favour

 SILL Venus is going to ask me a favour

 PRET You see I am Venus

 SILL No one who saw your face would doubt it

 NICE aside No one who knew her character would

 PRET Well Venus you know is married to Mars

 SILL To Vulcan my dear to Vulcan The exact connubial relation
 of the different gods and goddesses is a point on which we must
 be extremely particular

 PRET I beg your pardonVenus is married to Mars

 NICE If she isnt married to Mars she ought to be

 SILL Then that decides itcall it married to Mars

 PRET Married to Vulcan or married to Mars what does it signify

 SILL My dear its a matter on which I have no personal feeling
 whatever

 PRET So that she is married to someone

 SILL Exactly So that she is married to someone Call it married
 to Mars

 PRET Now heres my difficulty Presumptios takes the place of
 Mars and Presumptios is my father

 SILL Then why object to Vulcan

 PRET Because Vulcan is my grandfather

 SILL But my dear what an objection You are playing a part
 till the real gods return Thats all Whether you are supposed
 to be married to your fatheror your grandfather what does it
 matter This passion for realism is the curse of the stage

 PRET Thats all very well but I cant throw myself into a part
 that has already lasted a twelvemonth when I have to make love
 to my father It interferes with my conception of the
 characters It spoils the part

 SILL Well well Ill see what can be done Exit Pretteia
 LUE Thats always the way with beginners theyve no
 imaginative power A true artist ought to be superior to such
 considerations Nicemis comes down R Well Nicemis I should
 say Diana whats wrong with you Dont you like your part

 NICE Oh immensely Its great fun

 SILL Dont you find it lonely out by yourself all night

 NICE Oh but Im not alone all night

 SILL But I dont want to ask any injudicious questions but who
 accompanies you

 NICE Who Why Sparkeion of course

 SILL Sparkeion Well but Sparkeion is Phoebus Apollo enter
 Sparkeion Hes the sun you know

 NICE Of course he is I should catch my death of cold in the
 night air if he didnt accompany me

 SPAR My dear Sillimon it would never do for a young lady to be
 out alone all night It wouldnt be respectable

 SILL Theres a good deal of truth in that But stillthe sun
 at nightI dont like the idea The original Diana always went
 out alone

 NICE I hope the original Diana is no rule for me After all
 what does it matter

 SILL To be surewhat does it matter

 SPAR The sun at night or in the daytime

 SILL So that he shines Thats all thats necessary Exit
 Nicemis RUE But poor Daphne what will she say to this

 SPAR Oh Daphne can console herself young ladies soon get over
 this sort of thing Did you never hear of the young lady who was
 engaged to Cousin Robin

 SILL Never

 SPAR Then Ill sing it to you

 Little maid of Arcadee
 Sat on Cousin Robins knee
 Thought in form and face and limb
 Nobody could rival him
 He was brave and she was fair
 Truth they made a pretty paid
 Happy little maiden she
 Happy maid of Arcadee

 Moments fled as moments will
 Happily enough until
 After say a month or two
 Robin did as Robins do
 Weary of his lovers play
 Jilted her and went away
 Wretched little maiden she
 Wretched maid of Arcadee

 To her little home she crept
 There she sat her down and wept
 Maiden wept as maidens will
 Grew so thin and paleuntil
 Cousin Richard came to woo
 Then again the roses grew
 Happy little maiden she
 Happy maid of Arcadee Exit Sparkeion

 SILL Well Mercury my boy youve had a years experience of us
 here How do we do it I think were rather an improvement on the
 original godsdont you

 MER Well you see theres a good deal to be said on both sides
 of the question you are certainly younger than the original
 gods and therefore more active On the other hand they are
 certainly older than you and have therefore more experience
 On the whole I prefer you because your mistakes amuse me

 Olympus is now in a terrible muddle
 The deputy deities all are at fault
 They splutter and splash like a pig in a puddle
 And dickens a one of ems earning his salt
 For Thespis as Jove is a terrible blunder
 Too nervous and timidtoo easy and weak
 Whenever hes called on to lighten or thunder
 The thought of it keeps him awake for a week

 Then mighty Mars hasnt the pluck of a parrot
 When left in the dark he will quiver and quail
 And Vulcan has arms that would snap like a carrot
 Before he could drive in a tenpenny nail
 Then Venuss freckles are very repelling
 And Venus should not have a quint in her eyes
 The learned Minerva is weak in her spelling
 And scatters her hs all over the skies

 Then Pluto in kindhearted tenderness erring
 Cant make up his mind to let anyone die
 The Times has a paragraph ever recurring
 Remarkable incidence of longevity
 On some it has some as a serious onus
 to others its quite an advantagein short
 While evre life office declares a big bonus
 The poor undertakers are all in the court

 Then Cupid the rascal forgetting his trade is
 To make men and women impartially smart
 Will only shoot at pretty young ladies
 And never takes aim at a bachelors heart
 The results of this freakor whatever you term it
 Should cover the wicked young scamp with disgrace
 While evry young man is as shy as a hermit
 Young ladies are popping all over the place

 This wouldnt much matterfor bashful and shymen
 When skillfully handled are certain to fall
 But alas that determined young bachelor Hymen
 Refuses to wed anybody at all
 He swears that Loves flame is the vilest of arsons
 And looks upon marriage as quite a mistake
 Now what in the worlds to become of the parsons
 And what of the artist who sugars the cake

 In short you will see from the facts that Im showing
 The state of the case is exceedingly sad
 If Thespiss people go on as theyre going
 Olympus will certainly go to the bad
 From Jupiter downward there isnt a dab in it
 All of em quibble and shuffle and shirk
 A premier in Downing Street forming a cabinet
 Couldnt find people less fit for their work

 enter Thespis LUE

 THES Sillimon you can retire

 SILL Sir I

 THES Dont pretend you cant when I say you can Ive seen you
 do itgo exit Sillimon bowing extravagantly Thespis imitates
 himWell Mercury Ive been in power one year today

 MER One year today How do you like ruling the world

 THES Like it Why its as straightforward as possible Why
 there hasnt been a hitch of any kind since we came up here Lor
 the airs you gods and goddesses give yourselves are perfectly
 sickening Why its mere childs play

 MER Very simple isnt it

 THES Simple Why I could do it on my head

 MER AhI darsay you will do it on your head very soon

 THES What do you mean by that Mercury

 MER I mean that when youve turned the world quite topsyturvy
 you wont know whether youre standing on your head or your
 heels

 THES Well but Mercury its all right at present

 MER Oh yesas far as we know

 THES Well but you know we know as much as anybody knows you
 know I believe the worlds still going on

 MER Yesas far as we can judgemuch as usual

 THES Well the give the Father of the Drama his due Mercury
 Dont be envious of the Father of the Drama

 MER But you see you leave so much to accident

 THES Well Mercury if I do its my principle I am an easy
 man and I like to make things as pleasant as possible What did
 I do the day we took office Why I called the company together
 and I said to them Here we are you know gods and goddesses
 no mistake about it the real thing Well we have certain duties
 to discharge lets discharge them intelligently Dont let us be
 hampered by routine and red tape and precedent lets set the
 original gods an example and put a liberal interpretation on our
 duties If it occurs to any one to try an experiment in his own
 department let him try it if he fails theres no harm done if
 he succeeds it is a distinct gain to society Dont hurry your
 work do it slowly and well And here we are after a twelvemonth
 and not a single complaint or a single petition has reached me

 MER No not yet

 THES What do you mean by nonot yet

 MER Well you see you dont understand things All the
 petitions that are addressed by men to Jupiter pass through my
 hands and its my duty to collect them and present them once a
 year

 THES Oh only once a year

 MER Only once a year

 THES And the year is up

 MER Today

 THES Oh then I suppose there are some complaints

 MER Yes there are some

 THES Disturbed Oh perhaps there are a good many

 MER There are a good many

 THES Oh perhaps there are a thundering lot

 MER There are a thundering lot

 THES very much disturbed Oh

 MER You see youve been taking it so very easyand so have most
 of your company

 THES Oh who has been taking it easy

 MER Well all except those who have been trying experiments

 THES Well but I suppose the experiment are ingenious

 MER Yes they are ingenious but on the whole illjudged But
 its time go and summon your court

 THES What for

 MER To hear the complaints In five minutes they will be here
 Exit

 THES very uneasy I dont know how it is but there is
 something in that young mans manner that suggests that the
 father of the gods has been taking it too easy Perhaps it would
 have been better if I hadnt given my company so much scope I
 wonder what theyve been doing I think I will curtail their
 discretion though none of them appear to have much of the
 article It seems a pity to deprive em of what little they
 have

 Enter Daphne weeping

 THES Now then Daphne whats the matter with you

 DAPH Well you know how disgracefully Sparkeion

 THES correcting her Apollo

 DAPH Apollo thenhas treated me He promised to marry me years
 ago and now hes married to Nicemis

 DAPH I beg your pardon He is my husband

 NICE Apollo is Sparkeion and hes married to me

 position but Ill fall in with any arrangement Thespis may
 propose

 DAPH Ive just found out that hes my husband and yet he goes
 out every evening with that thing

 THES Perhaps hes trying an experiment

 DAPH I dont like my husband to make such experiments The

 other

 DAPH It will surely be quite fair
 To decide by Lempriere

 SPAR  THES How you settle it I dont care
 Leave it all to Lempriere
 Spoken The Verdict
 As Sparkeion is Apollo
 Up in this Olympian clime
 Why Nicemis it will follow
 Hes her husband for the time indicating Daphne

 When Sparkeion turns to mortal
 Join once more the sons of men
 He may take you to his portal indicating Nicemis
 He will be your husband then
 That oh that is my decision
 Cording to my mental vision
 Put an end to all collision
 My decision my decision

 ALL That oh that is his decision etc

 Exeunt Thes Nice Spar and Daphne Spar with Daphne Nicemis
 weeping with Thespis mysterious music Enter Jupiter Apollo
 and Mars from below at the back of stage All wear cloaks as
 disguise and all are masked

 JUP AP MARS Oh rage and fury Oh shame and sorrow
 Well be resuming our ranks tomorrow
 Since from Olympus we have departed
 Weve been distracted and brokenhearted

 Where is the monster Avenge his blunders
 He has awakened Olympian thunders

 Enter Mercury

 JUP Oh monster

 Enter thespians

 THES My dear fellows youre distressing yourselves
 unnecessarily The court of Olympus is about to assemble to
 listen to the complaints of the year if any But there are
 none or next to none Let the Olympians assemble Thespis
 takes chair JUP AP and MARS sit below him

 Ladies and gentlemen it seems that it is usual for the gods to
 assemble once a year to listen to mortal petitions It doesnt
 seem to me to be a good plan as work is liable to accumulate
 but as I am particularly anxious not to interfere with Olympian
 precedent but to allow everything to go on as it has always been
 accustomed to gowhy well say no more about it aside But
 how shall I account for your presence

 JUP Say we are the gentlemen of the press

 THES That all our proceedings may be perfectly open and above
 board I have communicated with the most influential members of
 the Athenian press and I beg to introduce to your notice three
 of its most distinguished members They bear marks emblematic of
 the anonymous character of modern journalism Business of
 introduction Thespis is very uneasy Now then if youre all
 ready we will begin

 MER brings tremendous bundle of petitions Here is the agenda

 THES Whats that The petitions

 MER Some of them opens one and reads Ah I thought thered be
 a row about it

 THES Why whats wrong now

 MER Why its been a foggy Friday in November for the last six
 months and the Athenians are tired of it

 THES Theres no pleasing some people This craving for perpetual
 change is the curse of the country Fridays a very nice day

 MER So it is but a Friday six months longit gets monotonous

 JUP AP MARS rising Its perfectly ridiculous

 THES calling them Cymon

 CYM as time with the usual attributes Sir

 THES Introducing him to the three gods Allow meFather Time

 course of time time will grow older Now then Father Time

 THES You hear He found it answer admirably

 CYM Yes only Sunday refused to take its place

 THES Sunday refused to take its place

 TIM Ive abolished battles its an experiment

 MARS spring up Oh come I say

 THES Quiet then to Tim Abolished battles

 TIM Yes you told us on taking office to remember two things To
 try experiments and to take it easy I found I couldnt take it
 easy while there are any battles to attend to so I tried the
 experiment and abolished battles And then I took it easy The
 Peace Society ought to be very much obliged to me

 THES Obliged to you Why confound it Since battles have been
 abolished war is universal

 TIM War is universal

 THES To b sure it is Now that nations cant fight no two of
 em are on speaking terms The dread of fighting was the only
 thing that kept them civil to each other Let battles be
 restored and peace reign supreme

 MER Heres a petition from the associated wine merchants of
 Mytilene Are there no grapes this year

 THES Well whats wrong with the associated wine merchants of
 Mytilene Are there no grapes this year

 beer

 THREE GODS Oh come I say rising they are put down by Thespis

 THES Eh what much alarmed Bacchus

 TIPS as Bacchus Here

 THES There seems to be something unusual with the grapes of
 Mytilene They only grow ginger beer

 TIPS And a very good thing too

 THES Its very nice in its way but it is not what one looks for
 from grapes

 TIPS Beloved master a week before we came up here you insisted
 on my taking the pledge By so doing you rescued me from my
 otherwise inevitable misery I cannot express my thanks Embrace
 me attempts to embrace him

 THES Get out dont be a fool Look here you know youre the
 god of wine

 TIPS I am

 THES very angry Well do you consider it consistent with your
 duty as the god of wine to make the grapes yield nothing but
 ginger beer

 TIPS Do you consider it consistent with my duty as a total
 abstainer to grow anything stronger than ginger beer

 THES But your duty as the god of wine

 TIPS In every respect in which my duty as the god of wine can be
 discharged consistently with my duty as a total abstainer I will
 discharge it But when the functions clash everything must give
 way to the pledge My preserver Attempts to embrace him

 THES Dont be a confounded fool This can be arranged We cant
 give over the wine this year but at least we can improve the
 ginger beer Let all the ginger beer be extracted from it
 immediately

 THREE GODS We cant stand this
 We cant stand this
 Its much too strong
 We cant stand this
 It would be wrong
 Extremely wrong
 If we stood this

 If we stand this
 If we stand this
 We cant stand this

 DAPH SPAR NICE Great Jove this interference
 Is more than we can stand
 Of them make a clearance
 With your majestic hand

 JOVE This cool audacity it beats us hollow
 Im Jupiter

 MARS Im Mars

 Pardon us Jupiter Mars
 Oh see us in misery wallow
 Cursing our terrible stars

 Of doing your best to make things jolly
 Ive ruled the world like a chap in his senses
 Observe the terrible consequences
 Great Jupiter whom nothing pleases
 Splutters and swears and kicks up breezes
 And sends us home in a mood avengin
 In double quick time like a railroad engine
 And this he does without compunction
 Because I have discharged with unction
 A highly complicated function
 Complying with his own injunction
 Fol lol lay

 CHO All this he doesetc

 The gods drive the thespians away The thespians prepare to
 descent the mountain as the curtain falls

 SONG  DEFENDANT

 When first my old old love I knew
 My bosom welled with joy
 My riches at her feet I threw
 I was a lovesick boy
 No terms seemed too extravagant
 Upon her to employ
 I used to mope and sigh and pant
 Just like a lovesick boy
 Tinkatank Tinkatank

 But joy incessant palls the sense
 And love unchanged will cloy
 And she became a bore intense
 Unto her lovesick boy
 With fitful glimmer burnt my flame
 And I grew cold and coy
 At last one morning I became
 Anothers lovesick boy
 Tinkatank Tinkatank

 CHORUS OF JURYMEN advancing stealthily

 Oh I was like that when a lad
 A shocking young scamp of a rover
 I behaved like a regular cad
 But that sort of thing is all over
 Im now a respectable chap
 And shine with a virtue resplendent
 And therefore I havent a scrap
 Of sympathy with the defendant
 He shall treat us with awe
 If there isnt a flaw

 SONGJUDGE

 When I good friends was called to the bar
 Id an appetite fresh and hearty
 But I was as many young barristers are
 An impecunious party

 Id a swallowtail coat of a beautiful blue
 And a brief which I bought of a booby
 A couple of shirts and a collar or two
 And a ring that looked like a ruby

 CHORUS A couple of shirts etc

 JUDGE At Westminster Hall I danced a dance
 Like a semidespondent fury
 For I thought I never should hit on a chance
 Of addressing a British Jury
 But I soon got tired of thirdclass journeys
 And dinners of bread and water
 So I fell in love with a rich attorneys
 Elderly ugly daughter

 CHORUS So he fell in love etc

 JUDGE The rich attorney he jumped with joy
 And replied to my fond professions
 You shall reap the reward of your pluck my boy
 At the Bailey and Middlesex sessions
 Youll soon get used to her looks said he
 And a very nice girl you will find her
 She may very well pass for fortythree
 In the dusk with a light behind her

 CHORUS She may very well etc

 JUDGE The rich attorney was good as his word
 The briefs came trooping gaily
 And every day my voice was heard
 At the Sessions or Ancient Bailey
 All thieves who could my fees afford
 Relied on my orations
 And many a burglar Ive restored
 To his friends and his relations

 CHORUS And many a burglar etc

 JUDGE At length I became as rich as the Gurneys
 An incubus then I thought her
 So I threw over that rich attorneys
 Elderly ugly daughter
 The rich attorney my character high
 Tried vainly to disparage
 And now if you please Im ready to try
 This Breach of Promise of Marriage

 CHORUS And now if you please etc

 JUDGE For now Im a Judge

 JUDGE For now Im a Judge

 I am no unhappy maid

 The Judge having by this time transferred his admiration to
 Plaintiff directs the Usher to take the note from First
 Bridesmaid and hand it to Plaintiff who reads it

 USHER Silence in Court

 SONG  DEFENDANT

 Oh gentlemen listen I pray
 Though I own that my heart has been ranging
 Of nature the laws I obey
 For nature is constantly changing
 The moon in her phases is found
 The time and the wind and the weather
 The months in succession come round
 And you dont find two Mondays together
 Consider the moral I pray
 Nor bring a young fellow to sorrow
 Who loves this young lady today
 And loves that young lady tomorrow

 BRIDESMAIDS rushing forward and kneeling to Jury

 Consider the moral etc

 One cannot eat breakfast all day
 Nor is it the act of a sinner
 When breakfast is taken away
 To turn his attention to dinner
 And its not in the range of belief
 To look upon him as a glutton
 Who when he is tired of beef
 Determines to tackle the mutton
 But this I am willing to say
 If it will appease her sorrow
 Ill marry this lady today
 And Ill marry the other tomorrow

 BRIDESMAIDS rushing forward as before

 But this he is willing say etc

 RECIT  JUDGE

 That seems a reasonable proposition
 To which I think your client may agree

 COUNSEL
 But I submit mlud with all submission
 To marry two at once is Burglaree
 Referring to law book
 In the reign of James the Second
 It was generally reckoned
 As a rather serious crime
 To marry two wives at a time
 Hands book up to Judge who reads it

 ALL Oh man of learning

 QUARTETTE

 JUDGE A nice dilemma we have here
 That calls for all our wit

 COUNSEL And at this stage it dont appear
 That we can settle it

 DEFENDANT in Witnessbox
 If I to wed the girl am loth
 A breach twill surely be

 PLAINTIFF And if he goes and marries both
 It counts as Burglaree

 ALL A nice dilemma we have here
 That calls for all our wit

 DUET  PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT

 PLAINTIFF embracing him rapturously

 I love himI love himwith fervour unceasing
 I worship and madly adore
 My blind adoration is ever increasing
 My loss I shall ever deplore
 Oh see what a blessing what love and caressing
 Ive lost and remember it pray
 When you Im addressing are busy assessing
 The damages Edwin must pay
 Yes he must pay

 DEFENDANT repelling her furiously

 I smoke like a furnaceIm always in liquor
 A ruffiana bullya sot
 Im sure I should thrash her perhaps I should kick her
 I am such a very bad lot
 Im not prepossessing as you may be guessing
 She couldnt endure me a day
 Recall my professing when you are assessing
 The damages Edwin must pay

 PLAINTIFF Yes he must pay

 She clings to him passionately after a struggle he throws her
 off into arms of Counsel

 JURY We would be fairly acting
 But this is most distracting
 If when in liquor he would kick her
 That is an abatement

 RECIT  JUDGE

 The question gentlemenis one of liquor
 You ask for guidancethis is my reply
 He says when tipsy he would thrash and kick her
 Lets make him tipsy gentlemen and try

 COUNSEL With all respect
 I do object

 PLAINTIFF I do object

 DEFENDANT I dont object

 ALL With all respect

 JUDGE tossing his books and paper about

 All the legal furies seize you
 No proposal seems to please you

 Barristers and you attorneys
 Set out on your homeward journeys
 Gentle simpleminded Usher
 Get you if you like to Russher
 Put your briefs upon the shelf
 I will marry her myself

 OPENING CHORUS

 In lazy languormotionless
 We lie and dream of nothingness
 For visions come
 From Poppydom
 Direct at our command
 Or delicate alternative
 In open idleness we live
 With lyre and lute
 And silver flute
 The life of Lazyland

 SOLO  Phylla

 The song of birds
 In ivied towers
 The rippling play
 Of waterway
 The lowing herds
 The breath of flowers
 The languid loves
 Of turtle doves
 These simply joys are all at hand
 Upon thy shores O Lazyland

 Enter Calynx

 Calynx Good news Great news His Majestys eldest daughter
 Princess Zara who left our shores five years since to go
 to
 Englandthe greatest the most powerful the wisest
 country
 in the worldhas taken a high degree at Girton and is
 on
 her way home again having achieved a complete mastery
 over
 all the elements that have tended to raise that glorious
 country to her present preeminent position among
 civilized
 nations

 Salata Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely
 Angli
 cized

 Calynx Absolutely and without a doubt

 Melene lazily We are very well as we are Life without a
 careevery want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch
 who despot though he be has no other thought than to
 make
 his people happywhat have we to gain by the great
 change
 that is in store for us

 Salata What have we to gain English institutions English
 tastes
 and oh English fashions

 Calynx England has made herself what she is because in that fa
 vored land every one has to think for himself Here we
 have no need to think because our monarch anticipates
 all
 our wants and our political opinions are formed for us
 by
 the journals to which we subscribe Oh think how much
 more
 brilliant this dialogue would have been if we had been
 accustomed to exercise our reflective powers They say
 that
 in England the conversation of the very meanest is a
 corus
 cation of impromptu epigram

 Enter Tarara in a great rage

 Tarara Lalabalele talala Callabale lalabalica falahle

 Calynx horrified Stopstop I beg All the ladies close
 their
 ears

 Tarara Callamalala galalate Caritalla lalabalee kallalale poo

 Ladies Oh stop him stop him

 Calynx My lord Im surprised at you Are you not aware that
 His
 Majesty in his despotic acquiescence with the emphatic
 wish
 of his people has ordered that the Utopian language
 shall
 be banished from his court and that all communications
 shall henceforward be made in the English tongue

 Tarara Yes Im perfectly aware of it althoughsuddenly
 present
 ing an explosive cracker Stopallow me

 Calynx pulls it Now whats that for

 Tarara Why Ive recently been appointed Public Exploder to His
 Majesty and as Im constitutionally nervous I must
 accus
 tom myself by degrees to the startling nature of my
 duties
 Thank you I was about to say that although as Public
 Exploder I am next in succession to the throne I
 neverthe
 less do my best to fall in with the royal decree But
 when
 I am overmastered by an indignant sense of overwhelming
 wrong as I am now I slip into my native tongue without
 knowing it I am told that in the language of that great
 and pure nation strong expressions do not exist conse
 quently when I want to let off steam I have no
 alternative
 but to say Lalabalele molola lililah kallalale poo

 Calynx But what is your grievance

 Tarara Thisby our Constitution we are governed by a Despot
 who
 although in theory absoluteis in practice nothing of
 the
 kindbeing watched day and night by two Wise Men whose
 duty
 it is on his very first lapse from political or social
 propriety to denounce him to me the Public Exploder
 and
 it then becomes my duty to blow up His Majesty with
 dynamiteallow me Presenting a cracker which Calynx
 pulls Thank youand as some compensation to my
 wounded
 feelings I reign in his stead

 Calynx Yes After many unhappy experiments in the direction of
 an
 ideal Republic it was found that what may be described
 as a
 Despotism tempered by Dynamite provides on the whole
 the
 most satisfactory description of ruleran autocrat who
 dares not abuse his autocratic power

 Tarara Thats the theorybut in practice how does it act
 Now
 do you ever happen to see the Palace Peeper producing
 a
 Society paper

 Calynx Never even heard of the journal

 Tarara Im not surprised because His Majestys agents always
 buy
 up the whole edition but I have an aunt in the
 publishing
 department and she has supplied me with a copy Well
 it
 actually teems with circumstantially convincing details
 of
 the Kings abominable immoralities If this highclass
 journal may be believed His Majesty is one of the most
 Heliogabalian profligates that ever disgraced an
 autocratic
 throne And do these Wise Men denounce him to me Not
 a
 bit of it They wink at his immoralities Under the
 cir
 cumstances I really think I am justified in exclaiming
 Lalabelele molola lililah kalabalale poo All horri
 fied I dont carethe occasion demands it Exit
 Tarara

 March Enter Guard escorting Scaphio and Phantis

 CHORUS

 O make way for the Wise Men
 They are the prizemen
 Doublefirst in the worlds university
 For though lovely this island
 Which is my land
 She has no one to match them in her city
 Theyre the pride of Utopia
 Cornucopia
 Is each his mental fertility
 O they make no blunder
 And no wonder
 For theyre triumphs of infallibility

 DUET  Scaphio and Phantis

 In every mental lore
 The statement smacks of vanity
 We claim to rank before
 The wisest of humanity
 As gifts of head and heart
 We wasted on utility
 Were cast to play a part
 Of great responsibility

 Our duty is to spy
 Upon our Kings illicites
 And keep a watchful eye
 On all his eccentricities
 If ever a trick he tries
 That savours of rascality
 At our decree he dies
 Without the least formality

 We fear no rude rebuff
 Or newspaper publicity
 Our word is quite enough
 The rest is electricity
 A pound of dynamite
 Explodes in his auriculars
 Its not a pleasant sight
 Well spare you the particulars

 Its force all men confess
 The King needs no admonishing
 We may say its success
 Is something quite astonishing
 Our despot it imbues
 With virtues quite delectable
 He minds his Ps and Qs
 And keeps himself respectable

 Of a tyrant polite
 Hes paragon quite
 Hes as modest and mild
 In his ways as a child
 And no one ever met
 With an autocrat yet
 So delightfully bland
 To the least in the land

 So make way for the wise men etc

 Exeunt all but Scaphio and Phantis Phantis is pensive

 Scaphio Phantis you are not in your customary exuberant spirits
 What is wrong

 Phantis Scaphio I think you once told me that you have never
 loved

 Scaphio Never I have often marvelled at the fairy influence
 which
 weaves its rosy web about the faculties of the greatest
 and
 wisest of our race but I thank Heaven I have never been
 subjected to its singular fascination For oh Phantis
 there is that within me that tells me that when my time
 does
 come the convulsion will be tremendous When I love it
 will be with the accumulated fervor of sixtysix years
 But
 I have an ideala semitransparent Being filled with an
 inorganic pink jellyand I have never yet seen the woman
 who approaches within measurable distance of it All are
 opaqueopaqueopaque

 Phantis Keep that ideal firmly before you and love not until you
 find her Though but fiftyfive I am an old campaigner
 in
 the battlefields of Love and believe me it is better
 to
 be as you are heartfree and happy than as I
 ameternally
 racked with doubting agonies Scaphio the Princess Zara
 returns from England today

 Scaphio My poor boy I see it all

 Phantis Oh Scaphio she is so beautiful Ah you smile for you
 have never seen her She sailed for England three months
 before you took office

 Scaphio Now tell me is your affection requited

 Phantis I do not knowI am not sure Sometimes I think it is
 and
 then come these torturing doubts I feel sure that she
 does
 not regard me with absolute indifference for she could
 never look at me without having to go to bed with a sick
 headache

 Scaphio That is surely something Come take heart boy you
 are
 young and beautiful What more could maiden want

 Phantis Ah Scaphio remember she returns from a land where every
 youth is as a young Greek god and where such beauty as
 I
 can boast is seen at every turn

 Scaphio Be of good cheer Marry her boy if so your fancy
 wills
 and be sure that love will come

 Phantis overjoyed Then you will assist me in this

 Scaphio Why surely Silly one what have you to fear We have
 but
 to say the word and her father must consent Is he not
 our
 very slave Come take heart I cannot bear to see you
 sad

 Phantis Now I may hope indeed Scaphio you have placed me on
 the
 very pinnacle of human joy

 DUET  Scaphio and Phantis

 Scaphio Let all your doubts take wing
 Our influence is great
 If Paramount our King
 Presume to hesitate
 Put on the screw
 And caution him
 That he will rue
 Disaster grim
 That must ensue
 To life and limb
 Should he poohpooh
 This harmless whim

 Both This harmless whimthis harmless whim
 It is as Iyou say a harmless whim

 Phantis dancing Observe this dance
 Which I employ
 When I by chance
 Go mad with joy
 What sentiment
 Does this express

 Phantis continues his dance while Scaphio vainly endeavors to
 discover
 its meaning

 Supreme content
 And happiness

 Both Of course it does Of course it does
 Supreme content and happiness

 Phantis Your friendly aid conferred
 I need no longer pine
 Ive but to speak the word
 And lo the maid is mine
 I do not choose
 To be denied
 Or wish to lose
 A lovely bride
 If to refuse
 The King decide
 The royal shoes
 Then woe betide

 Both Then woe betidethen woe betide
 The Royal shoes then woe betide

 Scaphio Dancing This step to use
 I condescend
 Wheneer I choose
 To serve a friend
 What it implies
 Now try to guess

 Scaphio continues his dance while Phantis is vainly endeavouring
 to
 discover its meaning

 It typifies
 Unselfishness

 Both Dancing Of course it does Of course it does
 It typifies unselfishness

 Exeunt Scaphio and
 Phantis

 March Enter King Paramount attended by guards and nobles and
 preced
 ed by girls dancing before him

 CHORUS

 Quaff the nectarcull the roses
 Gather fruit and flowers in plenty
 For our king no longer poses
 Sing the songs of far niente
 Wake the lute that sets us lilting
 Dance a welcome to each comer
 Day by day our year is wilting
 Sing the sunny songs of summer
 La la la la

 SOLO  King

 A King of autocratic power we
 A despot whose tyrannic will is law
 Whose rule is paramount oer land and sea
 A presence of unutterable awe
 But though the awe that I inspire
 Must shrivel with imperial fire
 All foes whom it may chance to touch
 To judge by what I see and hear
 It does not seem to interfere
 With popular enjoyment much

 Chorus No noit does not interfere
 With our enjoyment much

 Stupendous when we rouse ourselves to strike
 Resistless when our tyrant thunder peals
 We often wonder what obstructions like
 And how a contradicted monarch feels
 But as it is our Royal whim
 Our Royal sails to set and trim
 To suit whatever wind may blow
 What buffets contradiction deals
 And how a thwarted monarch feels
 We probably will never know

 Chorus No nowhat thwarted monarch feels
 Youll never never know

 RECITATIVE  King

 My subjects all it is your with emphatic
 That all Utopia shall henceforth be modelled
 Upon that glorious country called Great Britain
 To which some addbut others do notIreland

 Chorus It is

 King That being so as you insist upon it
 We have arranged that our two younger daughters
 Who have been finished by an English Lady
 tenderly A grave and good and gracious English Lady
 Shall daily be exhibited in public
 That all may learn what from the English standpoint
 Is looked upon as maidenly perfection
 Come hither daughters

 Enter Nekaya and Kalyba They are twins about fifteen years old
 they
 are very modest and demure in their appearance dress and
 manner
 They stand with their hands folded and their eyes cast down

 CHORUS

 How fair how modest how discreet
 How bashfully demure
 See how they blush as theyve been taught
 At this publicity unsought
 How English and how pure

 DUET  Nekaya and Kalyba

 Both Although of native maids the cream
 Were brought up on the English scheme
 The best of all
 For great and small
 Who modesty adore

 Nek For English girls are good as gold
 Extremely modest so were told
 Demurely coydivinely cold
 And that we areand more

 Kal To please papa who argues thus
 All girls should mould themselves on us
 Because we are
 By furlongs far
 The best of the bunch
 We show ourselves to loud applause
 From ten to four without a pause

 Nek Which is an awkward time because
 It cuts into our lunch

 Both Oh maids of high and low degree
 Whose social code is rather free
 Please look at us and you will see
 What good young ladies ought to be

 Nek And as we stand like clockwork toys
 A lecturer whom papa employs
 Proceeds to prussia
 Our modest ways
 And guileless character

 Kal Our wellknown blushour downcast eyes
 Our famous look of mild surprise

 Nek Which competition still defies
 Our celebrated Sir

 Kal Then all the crowd take down our looks
 In pocket memorandum books
 To diagnose
 Our modest pose
 The Kodaks do their best

 Nek If evidence you would possess
 Of what is maiden bashfulness
 You need only a button press

 Kal And we will do the rest


 Enter Lady Sophy  an English lady of mature years and extreme
 gravity
 of demeanour and dress She carries a lecturers wand in her
 hand She is led on by the King who expresses great regard
 and
 admiration for her

 RECITATIVE  Lady Sophy

 This morning we propose to illustrate
 A course of maiden courtship from the start
 To the triumphant matrimonial finish

 Through the following song the two Princesses illustrate in
 gesture
 the description given by Lady Sophy

 SONG  Lady Sophy

 Boldfaced ranger
 Perfect stranger
 Meets two wellbehaved young ladies
 Hes attractive
 Young and active
 Each a little bit afraid is
 Youth advances
 At his glances
 To their danger they awaken
 They repel him
 As they tell him
 He is very much mistaken
 Though they speak to him politely
 Please observe theyre sneering slightly
 Just to show hes acting vainly
 This is Virtue saying plainly
 Go away young bachelor
 We are not what you take us for
 When addressed impertinently
 English ladies answer gently
 Go away young bachelor
 We are not what you take us for

 As he gazes
 Hat he raises
 Enters into conversation
 Makes excuses
 This produces
 Interesting agitation
 He with daring
 Undespairing
 Give his cardhis rank discloses
 Little heeding
 This proceeding
 They turn up their little noses
 Pray observe this lesson vital
 When a man of rank and title
 His position first discloses
 Always cock your little noses
 When at home let all the class
 Try this in the looking glass
 English girls of well bred notions
 Shun all unrehearsed emotions
 English girls of highest class
 Practice them before the glass

 His intentions
 Then he mentions
 Something definite to go on
 Makes recitals
 Of his titles
 Hints at settlements and so on
 Smiling sweetly
 They discreetly
 Ask for further evidences
 Thus invited
 He delighted
 Gives the usual references
 This is business Each is fluttered
 When the offers fairly uttered
 Which of them has his affection
 He declines to make selection
 Do they quarrel for his dross
 Not a bit of itthey toss
 Please observe this cogent moral
 English ladies never quarrel
 When a doubt they come across
 English ladies always toss

 KING

 King I requested Scaphio and Phantis to be so good as to favor
 me
 with an audience this morning Enter SCAPHIO and
 PHANTIS
 Oh here they are

 Scaphio Your Majesty wished to speak with us I believe
 Youyou
 neednt keep your crown on on our account you know

 King I beg your pardon Removes it I always forget that
 Odd the notion of a King not being allowed to wear one
 of
 his own crowns in the presence of two of his own
 subjects

 Phantis Yesbizarre is it not

 King Most quaint But then its a quaint world

 Phantis Teems with quiet fun I often think what a lucky thing
 it
 is that you are blessed with such a keen sense of humor

 King Do you know I find it invaluable Do what I will I
 cannot
 help looking at the humorous side of thingsfor
 properly
 considered everything has its humorous sideeven the
 Palace Peeper producing it See hereAnother Royal
 Scandal by Junius Junior How long is this to last
 by
 Senex Senior Ribald Royalty by Mercury Major
 Where
 is the Public Exploder by Mephistopheles Minor When
 I
 reflect that all these outrageous attacks on my morality
 are
 written by me at your commandwell its one of the
 funni
 est things that have come within the scope of my
 experience

 Scaphio Besides apart from that they have a quiet humor of
 their
 own which is simply irresistible

 King gratified Not bad I think Biting trenchant
 sarcasmthe rapier not the bludgeonthats my line
 But
 then its so easyIm such a good subjecta bad King
 but a
 good Subjectha haa capital heading for next weeks
 leading article makes a note And then the stinging
 little paragraphs about our Royal goingson with our
 Royal
 Second Housemaiddelicately subacid are they not

 Scaphio My dear King in that kind of thing no one can hold a
 candle
 to you

 Phantis But the crowning joke is the Comic Opera youve written
 for
 usKing Tuppence or A Good Deal Less than Half a
 Sover
 eignin which the celebrated English tenor Mr
 Wilkinson
 burlesques your personal appearance and gives grotesque
 imitations of your Royal peculiarities Its immense

 King YeesThats what I wanted to speak to you about Now
 Ive not the least doubt but that even that has its
 humorous
 side tooif one could only see it As a rule Im pretty
 quick at detecting latent humorbut I confess I do not
 quite see where it comes in in this particular instance
 Its so horribly personal

 Scaphio Personal Yes of course its personalbut consider the
 antithetical humor of the situation

 King Yes II dont think Ive quite grasped that

 Scaphio No You surprise me Why consider During the day
 thou
 sands tremble at your frown during the night from 8 to
 11
 thousands roar at it During the day your most arbitrary
 pronouncements are received by your subjects with abject
 submissionduring the night they shout with joy at your
 most terrible decrees Its not every monarch who enjoys
 the privilege of undoing by night all the despotic
 absurdi
 ties hes committed during the day

 King Of course Now I see it Thank you very much I was
 sure
 it had its humorous side and it was very dull of me not
 to
 have seen it before But as I said just now its a
 quaint
 world

 Phantis Teems with quiet fun

 King Yes Properly considered what a farce life is to be
 sure

 SONG  King

 First youre bornand Ill be bound you
 Find a dozen strangers round you
 Hallo cries the newborn baby
 Wheres my parents which may they be
 Awkward silenceno reply
 Puzzled baby wonders why
 Father rises bows politely
 Mother smiles but not too brightly
 Doctor mumbles like a dumb thing
 Nurse is busy mixing something
 Every symptom tends to show
 Youre decidedly de trop

 All Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
 Times teetotum
 If you spin it
 Gives it quotum
 Once a minute
 Ill go bail
 You hit the nail
 And if you fail
 The deuce is in it

 King You grow up and you discover
 What it is to be a lover
 Some young lady is selected
 Poor perhaps but wellconnected
 Whom you hail for Love is blind
 As the Queen of fairy kind
 Though shes plainperhaps unsightly
 Makes her face uplaces tightly
 In her form your fancy traces
 All the gifts of all the graces
 Rivals none the maiden woo
 So you take her and she takes you

 All Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
 Joke beginning
 Never ceases
 Till your inning
 Time releases
 On your way
 You blindly stray
 And day by day
 The joke increases

 King Ten years laterTime progresses
 Sours your temperthins your tresses
 Fancy then her chain relaxes
 Rates are facts and so are taxes
 Fairy Queens no longer young
 Fairy Queen has got a tongue
 Twins have probably intruded
 Quite unbiddenjust as you did
 Theyre a source of care and trouble
 Just as you wereonly double
 Comes at last the final stroke
 Time has had its little joke

 All Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
 Daily driven
 Wife as drover
 Ill youve thriven
 Neer in clover
 Lastly when
 Threescore and ten
 And not till then
 The joke is over
 Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
 Thenand then
 The joke is over

 Exeunt Scaphio and
 Phantis

 King putting on his crown again Its all very well I
 always
 like to look on the humorous side of things but I do not
 think I ought to be required to write libels on my own
 moral
 character Naturally I see the joke of itanybody
 wouldbut Zaras coming home today shes no longer a
 child and I confess I should not like her to see my
 Operathough its uncommonly well written and I should
 be
 sorry if the Palace Peeper got into her handsthough
 its
 certainly smartvery smart indeed It is almost a pity
 that I have to buy up the whole edition because its
 really
 too good to be lost And Lady Sophythat blameless type
 of
 perfect womanhood Great Heavens what would she say if
 the
 Second Housemaid business happened to meet her pure blue
 eye Enter Lady Sophy

 Lady S My monarch is soliloquizing I will withdraw going

 King Nopray dont go Now Ill give you fifty chances and
 you
 wont guess whom I was thinking of

 Lady S Alas sir I know too well Ah King its an old old
 story and Im wellnigh weary of it Be warned in
 timefrom my heart I pity you but I am not for you
 going

 King But hear what I have to say

 Lady S It is useless Listen In the course of a long and
 adven
 turous career in the principal European Courts it has
 been
 revealed to me that I unconsciously exercise a weird and
 supernatural fascination over all Crowned Heads So
 irre
 sistible is this singular property that there is not a
 European Monarch who has not implored me with tears in
 his
 eyes to quit his kingdom and take my fatal charms else
 where As time was getting on it occurred to me that by
 descending several pegs in the scale of Respectability I
 might qualify your Majesty for my hand Actuated by this
 humane motive and happening to possess Respectability
 enough
 for Six I consented to confer Respectability enough for
 Four upon your two younger daughtersbut although I
 have
 alas only Respectability enough for Two left there is
 still as I gather from the public press of this country
 producing the Palace Peeper a considerable balance in
 my
 favor

 King aside Damn aloud May I ask how you came by this

 Lady S It was handed to me by the officer who holds the position
 of
 Public Exploder to your Imperial Majesty

 King And surely Lady Sophy surely you are not so unjust as
 to
 place any faith in the irresponsible gabble of the
 Society
 press

 Lady S referring to paper I read on the authority of Senex
 Senior that your Majesty was seen dancing with your
 Second
 Housemaid on the Oriental Platform of the Tivoli Gardens
 That is untrue

 King Absolutely Our Second Housemaid has only one leg

 Lady S suspiciously How do you know that

 King Common report I give you my honor

 Lady S It may be so I further readand the statement is
 vouched
 for by no less an authority that Mephistopheles
 Minorthat
 your Majesty indulges in a bath of hot rumpunch every
 morning I trust I do not lay myself open to the charge
 of
 displaying an indelicate curiosity as to the mysteries of
 the royal dressingroom when I ask if there is any
 founda
 tion for this statement

 King None whatever When our medical adviser exhibits
 rumpunch
 it is as a draught not as a fomentation As to our
 bath
 our valet plays the garden hose upon us every morning

 Lady S shocked Oh praypray spare me these unseemly
 details
 Well you are a Despothave you taken steps to slay this
 scribbler

 King Well noI have not gone so far as that After all
 its
 the poor devils living you know

 Lady S It is the poor devils living that surprises me If this
 man lies there is no recognized punishment that is
 suffi
 ciently terrible for him

 King Thats precisely it II am waiting until a punishment
 is
 discovered that will exactly meet the enormity of the
 case
 I am in constant communication with the Mikado of Japan
 who
 is a leading authority on such points and moreover I
 have
 the ground plans and sectional elevations of several
 capital
 punishments in my desk at this moment Oh Lady Sophy
 as
 you are powerful be merciful

 DUET  King and Lady Sophy

 King Subjected to your heavenly gaze
 Poetical phrase
 My brain is turned completely
 Observe me now
 No monarch I vow
 Was ever so afflicted

 Lady S Im pleased with that poetical phrase
 A heavenly gaze
 But though you put it neatly
 Say what you will
 These paragraphs still
 Remain uncontradicted

 Come crush me this contemptible worm
 A forcible term
 If hes assailed you wrongly
 The rage display
 Which as you say
 Has moved your Majesty lately

 King Though I admit that forcible term
 Contemptible worm
 Appeals to me most strongly
 To treat this pest
 As you suggest
 Would pain my Majesty greatly

 Lady S This writer lies
 King Yes bother his eyes
 Lady S He lives you say
 King In a sort of way
 Lady S Then have him shot
 King Decidedly not
 Lady S Or crush him flat
 King I cannot do that
 Both O royal Rex
 Myher blameless sex
 Abhors such conduct shady
 YouI plead in vain
 Iyou will never gain
 Respectable English lady

 sensitiveness

 Fitz Oh I dont think theres any chance of that

 King You think not They wont be offended

 Fitz Oh no They are quite hardened to it They get a good
 deal

 gentleman is to blow out the brains of the other it is
 provided by the Rival Admirers Clauses Consolidation
 Act
 that the lady shall be entrusted to an officer of
 Household
 Cavalry as stakeholder who is bound to hand her over to

 survivor on the Tontine principle in a good condition
 of
 substantial and decorative repair

 Oh neatlyplanned intention
 Oh happy intervention
 Oh well constructed plot

 Now please infer
 That nothing loth
 Youre henceforth as it were
 Engaged to marry both
 Then take it that I represent the two
 On that hypothesis what would you do

 Zara aside What would I do what would I do
 To Fitz In such a case
 Upon your breast
 My blushing face
 I think Id restdoing so
 Then perhaps I might
 Demurely say
 I find this breastplate bright
 Is sorely in the way

 Fitz Our mortal race
 Is never blest
 Theres no such case
 As perfect rest
 Some petty blight
 Asserts its sway
 Some crumbled roseleaf light
 Is always in the way

 Zara

 Enter King

 King My daughter At last we are alone together

 Zara Yes and Im glad we are for I want to speak to you very
 seriously Do you know this paper

 King aside Da Aloud Oh yesIveIve seen it
 Where
 in the world did you get this from

 Zara It was given to me by Lady Sophymy sisters governess

 King aside Lady Sophys an angel but I do sometimes wish
 shed mind her own business Aloud Itsha
 haits
 rather humorous

 Zara I see nothing humorous in it I only see that you the
 des
 potic King of this country are made the subject of the
 most
 scandalous insinuations Why do you permit these things

 King Well they appeal to my sense of humor Its the only
 really comic paper in Utopia and I wouldnt be without
 it
 for the world

 Zara If it had any literary merit I could understand it

 King Oh it has literary merit Oh distinctly it has
 literary
 merit

 Zara My dear father its mere ungrammatical twaddle

 King Oh its not ungrammatical I cant allow that
 Unpleas
 antly personal perhaps but written with an
 epigrammatical
 point that is very rare nowadaysvery rare indeed

 Zara looking at cartoon Why do they represent you with such
 a
 big nose

 King looking at cartoon Eh Yes it is a big one Why
 the
 fact is that in the cartoons of a comic paper the size
 of
 your nose always varies inversely as the square of your
 popularity Its the rule

 Zara Then you must be at a tremendous discount just now I
 see a
 notice of a new piece called King Tuppence in which an
 English tenor has the audacity to personate you on a
 public
 stage I can only say that I am surprised that any
 English
 tenor should lend himself to such degrading
 personalities

 King Oh hes not really English As it happens hes a
 Utopian
 but he calls himself English

 Zara Calls himself English

 King Yes Bless you they wouldnt listen to any tenor who
 didnt call himself English

 Zara And you permit this insolent buffoon to caricature you in
 a
 pointless burlesque My dear fatherif you were a free
 agent you would never permit these outrages

 King almost in tears ZaraII admit I am not altogether
 a
 free agent II am controlled I try to make the best
 of
 it but sometimes I find it very difficultvery
 difficult
 indeed Nominally a Despot I am between ourselves the
 helpless tool of two unscrupulous Wise Men who insist on
 my
 falling in with all their wishes and threaten to denounce
 me
 for immediate explosion if I remonstrate Breaks down
 completely

 Zara My poor father Now listen to me With a view to
 remodel
 ling the political and social institutions of Utopia I
 have
 brought with me six Representatives of the principal
 causes
 that have tended to make England the powerful happy and
 blameless country which the consensus of European

 in
 the hands of these gentlemen and they will reorganize
 your
 country on a footing that will enable you to defy your
 persecutors They are all now washing their hands after
 their journey Shall I introduce them

 Capt Corc Get up your steam and cut your canvas short
 Sir B To speak on both sides teach your sluggish brains
 Mr B Widen your thoroughfares and flush your drains
 Mr Gold Utopias much too big for one small head
 Ill float it as a Company Limited

 King A Company Limited What may that be
 The term I rather think is new to me

 Chorus A company limited etc

 Sca Phant and Tara Aside
 What does he mean What does he mean
 Give us a kind of clue
 What does he mean What does he mean
 What is he going to do

 SONG  Mr Goldbury

 Some seven men form an Association
 If possible all Peers and Baronets
 The start off with a public declaration
 To what extent they mean to pay their debts
 Thats called their Capital if they are wary
 They will not quote it at a sum immense
 The figures immaterialit may vary
 From eighteen million down to eighteenpence
 I should put it rather low
 The good sense of doing so
 Will be evident at once to any debtor
 When its left to you to say
 What amount you mean to pay
 Why the lower you can put it at the better

 Chorus When its left to you to say etc

 They then proceed to trade with all wholl trust em
 Quite irrespective of their capital
 Its shady but its sanctified by custom
 Bank Railway Loan or Panama Canal
 You cant embark on trading too tremendous
 Its strictly fair and based on common sense
 If you succeed your profits are stupendous
 And if you fail pop goes your eighteenpence

 Make the moneyspinner spin
 For you only stand to win
 And youll never with dishonesty be twitted
 For nobody can know
 To a million or so
 To what extent your capitals committed

 Chorus No nobody can know etc

 If you come to grief and creditors are craving
 For nothing that is planned by mortal head
 Is certain in this Vale of Sorrowsaving
 That ones Liability is Limited
 Do you suppose that signifies perdition
 If so youre but a monetary dunce
 You merely file a WindingUp Petition
 And start another Company at once
 Though a Rothschild you may be
 In your own capacity
 As a Company youve come to utter sorrow
 But the Liquidators say
 Never mindyou neednt pay
 So you start another company tomorrow

 Chorus But the liquidators say etc

 King Well at first sight it strikes us as dishonest
 But if itss good enough for virtuous England
 The first commercial country in the world
 Its good enough for us

 Sca Phan Tar aside to the King
 Youd best take care
 Please recollect we have not been consulted

 King And do I understand that Great Britain
 Upon this Joint Stock principle is governed

 Mr G We havent come to that exactlybut
 Were tending rapidly in that direction
 The dates not distant

 King enthusiastically We will be before you
 Well go down in posterity renowned
 As the First Sovereign in Christendom
 Who registered his Crown and Country under
 The Joint Stock Companys Act of SixtyTwo

 All Ulahlica

 SOLO  King

 Henceforward of a verity
 With Fame ourselves we link
 Well go down to Posterity
 Of sovereigns all the pink

 Sca Phan Tar aside to King
 If youve the mad temerity
 Our wishes thus to blink
 Youll go down to Posterity
 Much earlier than you think

 Tar correcting them

 Hell go up to Posterity
 If I inflict the blow

 Sca Phan angrily

 Hell go down to Posterity
 We think we ought to know

 Tar explaining Hell go up to Posterity
 Blown up with dynamite

 Sca Phan apologetically

 Hell go up to Posterity
 Of course he will youre right

 ENSEMBLE

 King Lady Sophy Nek Sca Phan and Tar Fitz and
 Zara aside
 Kal Calynx and Chorus aside

 Henceforward of a verity If he has the temerity Who love
 with all sincerity
 With fame ourselves we Our wishes thus to blink Their
 lives may safely link
 link
 And go down to Posterity Hell go up to Posterity And as for
 our posterity
 Of sovereigns all pink Much earlier than they We dont
 care what they think
 think

 CHORUS

 Lets seal this mercantile pact
 The step we neer shall rue
 It gives whatever we lacked
 The statements strictly true
 All hail astonishing Fact
 All hail Invention new
 The Joint Stock Companys Act
 The Act of SixtyTwo

 END OF ACT I




ACT II


 Scene  Throne Room in the Palace Night Fitzbattleaxe
 discovered
 singing to Zara

 RECITATIVE  Fitzbattleaxe

 Oh Zara my beloved one bear with me
 Ah do not laugh at my attempted C
 Repent not mocking maid thy girlhoods choice
 The fervour of my love affects my voice

 SONG  Fitzbattleaxe

 A tenor all singers above
 This doesnt admit of a question
 Should keep himself quiet
 Attend to his diet
 And carefully nurse his digestion
 But when he is madly in love
 Its certain to tell on his singing
 You cant do the proper chromatics
 With proper emphatics
 When anguish your bosom is wringing
 When distracted with worries in plenty
 And his pulse is a hundred and twenty
 And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is
 A tenor cant do himself justice
 Now observesings a high note
 You see I cant do myself justice
 I could sing if my fervour were mock
 Its easy enough if youre acting
 But when ones emotion
 Is born of devotion
 You mustnt be overexacting
 One ought to be firm as a rock
 To venture a shake in vibrato
 When fervours expected
 Keep cool and collected
 Or never attempt agitato
 But of course when his tongue is of leather
 And his lips appear pasted together
 And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is
 A tenor cant do himself justice
 Now observesings a high note
 Its no useI cant do myself justice

 Zara Why Arthur what does it matter When the higher
 qualities
 of the heart are all that can be desired the higher
 notes
 of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance
 Who
 thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky
 Be
 sides demurely you are not singing for an engagement
 putting her hand in his you have that already

 Fitz How good and wise you are How unerringly your practiced
 brain winnows the wheat from the chaffthe material from
 the merely incidental

 Zara My Girton training Arthur At Girton all is wheat and
 idle chaff is never heard within its walls But tell me
 is
 not all working marvelously well Have not our Flowers
 of
 Progress more than justified their name

 Fitz We have indeed done our best Captain Corcoran and I
 have
 in concert thoroughly remodeled the sisterservicesand
 upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific trembles at
 the
 name of Utopia

 Zara How clever of you

 Fitz Clever Not a bit Its easy as possible when the
 Admiral
 ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere And so
 with
 the others Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
 idle Acts of Parliament all have given their natural
 tal
 ents full play and introduced reforms which even in Eng
 land were never dreamt of

 Zara But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
 ef
 fected by Mr Goldbury who discarding the exploded
 theory
 that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven
 has
 applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals
 and
 every man woman and child is now a Company Limited with
 liability restricted to the amount of his declared
 Capital
 There is not a christened baby in Utopia who has not
 already
 issued his little Prospectus

 Fitz Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can trans
 mute by a word a Limited Income into an Income Limited

 Zara Reform has not stopped hereit has been applied even to
 the
 costume of our people Discarding their own barbaric
 dress
 the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the
 taste
 ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety
 Scaphio
 and Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the
 whole
 of Utopia with clothing designed upon the most approved
 English modelsand the first DrawingRoom under the new
 state of things is to be held here this evening

 Fitz But DrawingRooms are always held in the afternoon

 Zara Ah weve improved upon that We all look so much better
 by
 candlelight And when I tell you dearest that my Court
 train has just arrived you will understand that I am
 long
 ing to go and try it on

 Fitz Then we must part

 Zara Necessarily for a time

 Fitz Just as I wanted to tell you with all the passionate
 enthu
 siasm of my nature how deeply how devotedly I love you

 Zara Hush Are these the accents of a heart that really
 feels
 True love does not indulge in declamationits voice is
 sweet and soft and low The west wind whispers when he
 woos the poplars

 DUET  Zara and Fitzbattleaxe

 Zara Words of love too loudly spoken
 Ring their own untimely knell
 Noisy vows are rudely broken
 Soft the song of Philomel
 Whisper sweetly whisper slowly
 Hour by hour and day by day
 Sweet and low as accents holy
 Are the notes of lovers lay

 Both Sweet and low etc

 Fitz Let the conqueror flushed with glory
 Bid his noisy clarions bray
 Lovers tell their artless story
 In a whispered virelay
 False is he whose vows alluring
 Make the listening echoes ring
 Sweet and low when allenduring
 Are the songs that lovers sing

 Both Sweet and low etc

 Exit Zara Enter King dressed as FieldMarshal

 King To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
 use
 of his limbs the costume of a British FieldMarshal is
 perhaps at first a little cramping Are you sure that
 this is all right Its not a practical joke is it No
 one has a keener sense of humor than I have but the
 First
 Statutory Cabinet Council of Utopia Limited must be
 conduct
 ed with dignity and impressiveness Now where are the
 other five who signed the Articles of Association

 Fitz Sir they are here

 Enter Lord Dramaleigh Captain Corcoran Sir Bailey Barre Mr
 Blushington and
 Mr Goldbury from different entrances

 King Oh Addressing them Gentlemen our daughter holds her
 first DrawingRoom in half an hour and we shall have
 time
 to make our halfyearly report in the interval I am
 neces
 sarily unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
 Councilperhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us
 in
 the way of doing the thing properly and with due regard
 to
 the solemnity of the occasion

 Lord D Certainlynothing simpler Kindly bring your chairs
 forwardHis Majesty will of course preside

 They range their chairs across stage like Christy Minstrels King
 sits center Lord Dramaleigh on his left Mr Goldbury on his
 right
 Captain Corcoran left of Lord Dramaleigh Captain
 Fitzbattleaxe right of
 Mr Goldbury Mr Blushington extreme right Sir Bailey Barre
 extreme
 left

 King Like this

 Lord D Like this

 King We take your word for it that this is all right You are
 not making fun of us This is in accordance with the
 prac
 tice at the Court of St Jamess

 Lord D Well it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
 of
 St Jamess Hall

 King Oh it seems odd but never mind

 SONG  King

 Society has quite forsaken all her wicked courses
 Which empties our police courts and abolishes divorces

 Chorus Divorce is nearly obsolete in England

 King No tolerance we show to undeserving rank and splendour
 For the higher his position is the greater the offender

 Chorus Thats maxim that is prevalent in England

 King No peeress at our drawingroom before the Presence passes
 Who wouldnt be accepted by the lower middleclasses
 Each shady dame whatever be her rank is bowed out
 neatly

 Chorus In short this happy country has been Anglicized
 completely
 Is really is surprising
 What a thorough Anglicizing
 We have brought aboutUtopias quite another land
 In her enterprising movements
 She is Englandwith improvements
 Which we dutifully offer to our motherland

 King Our city we have beautifiedweve done it willynilly
 And all that isnt Belgrave Square is Strand and
 Piccadilly

 Chorus We havent any slummeries in England

 King The chamberlain our native stage has purged beyond a
 ques
 tion
 Of risky situation and indelicate suggestion
 No piece is tolerated if its costumed indiscreetly

 Chorus In short this happy country has been Anglicized com
 pletely
 It really is surprising etc

 King Our peerage weve remodelled on an intellectual basis
 Which certainly is rough on our hereditary races

 Chorus We are going to remodel it in England

 King The Brewers and the Cotton Lords no longer seek
 admission
 And literary merit meets with proper recognition

 Chorus As literary merit does in England

 King Who knows but we may count among our intellectual
 chickens
 Like you an Earl of Thackery and praps a Duke of
 Dickens
 Lord Fildes and Viscount Millais when they come well
 welcome sweetly

 Chorus In short this happy country has been Anglicized
 completely
 It really is surprising etc

 At the end all rise and replace their chairs

 King Now then for our first DrawingRoom Where are the
 Prin
 cesses What an extraordinary thing it is that since
 Euro
 pean lookingglasses have been supplied to the Royal bed
 rooms my daughters are invariably late

 Lord D Sir their Royal Highnesses await your pleasure in the
 Anteroom

 King Oh Then request them to do us the favor to enter at
 once

 approaches The ladies curtsey in succession to the King and
 the
 three Princesses and pass out When all the presentations
 have
 been accomplished the King Princesses and Lady Sophy come
 forward and all the ladies reenter

 RECITATIVE  King

 This ceremonial our wish displays
 To copy all Great Britains courtly ways
 Though lofty aims catastrophe entail
 Well gloriously succeed or nobly fail

 UNACCOMPANIED CHORUS

 Eagle High in Cloudland soaring
 Sparrow twittering on a reed
 Tiger in the jungle roaring
 Frightened fawn in grassy mead
 Let the eagle not the sparrow
 Be the object of your arrow
 Fix the tiger with your eye
 Pass the fawn in pity by
 Glory then will crown the day
 Glory glory anyway

 Exit
 all

 Enter Scaphio and Phantis now dressed as judges in red and ermine
 robes
 and undress wigs They come down stage melodramatically 
 working together

 DUET  Scaphio and Phantis

 Sca With fury deep we burn

 Phan We do

 Sca We fume with smothered rage

 Phan We do

 Sca These Englishmen who rule supreme
 Their undertaking they redeem
 By stifling every harmless scheme
 In which we both engage

 Phan They do

 Sca In which we both engage

 Phan We think it is our turn

 Sca We do

 Phan We think our turn has come

 Sca We do

 Phan These Englishmen they must prepare
 To seek at once their native air
 The King as heretofore we swear
 Shall be beneath our thumb

 Sca He shall

 Phan Shall be beneath out thumb

 Sca He shall

 Both with great energy
 For this mustnt be and this wont do
 If youll back me then Ill back you
 No this wont do
 No this mustnt be
 With fury deep we burn

 Enter the King

 King Gentlemen gentlemenreally This unseemly display of
 energy within the Royal precincts is altogether unpardon
 able Pray what do you complain of

 Scaphio furiously What do we complain of Why through the
 innovations introduced by the Flowers of Progress all our
 harmless schemes for making a provision for our old age
 are
 ruined Our Matrimonial Agency is at a standstill our
 Cheap Sherry business is in bankruptcy our Army Clothing
 contracts are paralyzed and even our Society paper the
 Palace Peeper is practically defunct

 King Defunct Is that so Dear dear I am truly sorry

 Scaphio Are you aware that Sir Bailey Barre has introduced a law
 of
 libel by which all editors of scurrilous newspapers are
 pub
 licly floggedas in England And six of our editors
 have
 resigned in succession Now the editor of a scurrilous
 paper can stand a good dealhe takes a private thrashing
 as
 a matter of courseits considered in his salarybut no
 gentleman likes to be publicly flogged

 King Naturally I shouldnt like it myself

 Phantis Then our Burlesque Theater is absolutely ruined

 King Dear me Well theatrical property is not what it was

 Phantis Are you aware that the Lord Chamberlain who has his own
 views as to the best means of elevating the national
 drama
 has declined to license any play that is not in blank
 verse
 and three hundred years oldas in England

 Scaphio And as if that wasnt enough the County Councillor has
 or
 dered a fourfoot wall to be built up right across the
 proscenium in case of fireas in England

 Phantis Its so hard on the companywho are liable to be roasted
 aliveand this has to be met by enormously increased
 salariesas in England

 Scaphio You probably know that weve contracted to supply the
 entire
 nation with a complete English outfit But perhaps you
 do
 not know that when we send in our bills our customers
 plead liability limited to a declared capital of
 eighteenpence and apply to be dealt with under the
 Windingup Actas in England

 King Really gentlemen this is very irregular If you will
 be
 so good as to formulate a detailed list of your
 grievances
 in writing addressed to the Secretary of Utopia Limited
 they will be laid before the Board in due course at
 their
 next monthly meeting

 Scaphio Are we to understand that we are defied

 King That is the idea I intended to convey

 Phantis Defied We are defied

 Scaphio furiously Take careyou know our powers Trifle with
 us and you die

 TRIO  Scaphio Phantis and King

 Sca If you think that when banded in unity
 We may both be defied with impunity
 You are sadly misled of a verity

 Phan If you value repose and tranquility
 Youll revert to a state of docility
 Or prepare to regret your temerity

 King If my speech is unduly refractory
 You will find it a course satisfactory
 At an early Board meeting to show it up
 Though if proper excuse you can trump any
 You may wind up a Limited Company
 You cannot conveniently blow it up

 Scaphio and Phantis thoroughly baffled

 King Dancing quietly
 Wheneer I chance to baffle you
 I also dance a step or two
 Of this now guess the hidden sense

 Scaphio and Phantis consider the question as King continues
 dancing
 quietlythen give it up

 It means complete indifference

 Sca and Phan Of course it doesindifference
 It means complete indifference

 King dancing quietly Sca and Phan dancing furiously

 Sca and Phan As weve a dance for every mood
 With pas de trois we will conclude
 What this may mean you all may guess
 It typifies remorselessness

 King It means unruffled cheerfulness

 King dances off placidly as Scaphio and Phantis dance furiously

 Phantis breathless Hes rightwe are helpless Hes no
 longer a
 human beinghes a Corporation and so long as he
 confines
 himself to his Articles of Association we cant touch
 him
 What are we to do

 Scaphio Do Raise a Revolution repeal the Act of SixtyTwo
 recon
 vert him into an individual and insist on his immediate
 ex
 plosion Tarara enters Tarara come here youre the
 very man we want

 Tarara Certainly allow me Offers a cracker to each they
 snatch
 them away impatiently Thats rude

 Scaphio We have no time for idle forms You wish to succeed to
 the
 throne

 Tarara Naturally

 Scaphio Then you wont unless you join us The King has defied
 us
 and as matters stand we are helpless So are you We
 must devise some plot at once to bring the people about
 his
 ears

 Tarara A plot

 Phantis Yes a plot of superhuman subtlety Have you such a
 thing
 about you

 Tarara feeling No I think not No Theres one on my
 dressingtable

 Scaphio We cant waitwe must concoct one at once and put it
 into
 execution without delay There is not a moment to spare

 TRIO  Scaphio Phantis and Tarara

 Ensemble

 With wily brain upon the spot
 A private plot well plan
 The most ingenious private plot
 Since private plots began
 Thats understood So far weve got
 And striking while the irons hot
 Well now determine like a shot
 The details of this private plot

 Sca I think we oughtwhispers
 Phan and Tar Such bosh I never heard
 Phan Ah happy thoughtwhispers
 Sca and Tar How utterly dashed absurd
 Tar Ill tell you howwhispers
 Sca and Phan Why what put that in your head
 Sca Ive got it nowwhispers
 Phan and Tar Oh take him away to bed
 Phan Oh put him to bed
 Tar Oh put him to bed
 Sca What put me to bed
 Phan and Tar Yes certainly put him to bed
 Sca But bless me dont you see
 Phan Do listen to me I pray
 Tar It certainly seems to me
 Sca Bahthis is the only way
 Phan Its rubbish absurd you growl
 Tar You talk ridiculous stuff
 Sca Youre a drivelling barndoor owl
 Phan Youre a vapid and vain old muff

 All coming down to audience

 So far we havent quite solved the plot
 Theyre not a very ingenious lot
 But dont be unhappy
 Its still on the tapis
 Well presently hit on a capital plot

 Sca Suppose we allwhispers
 Phan Now there I think youre right
 Then we might allwhispers
 Tar Thats true we certainly might
 Ill tell you whatwhispers
 Sca We will if we possibly can
 Then on the spot whispers
 Phan and Tar Bravo A capital plan
 Sca Thats exceedingly neat and new
 Phan Exceedingly new and neat
 Tar I fancy that that will do
 Sca Its certainly very complete
 Phan Well done you sly old sap
 Tar Bravo you cunning old mole
 Sca You very ingenious chap
 Phan You intellectual soul

 All coming down and addressing audience

 At last a capital plan weve got
 We wont say how and we wont say what
 Its safe in my noddle
 Now off we will toddle
 And slyly develop this capital plot

 Business Exeunt Scaphio and Phantis in one direction and Tarara
 in
 the other

 Enter Lord Dramaleigh and Mr Goldbury

 Lord D Well what do you think of our first South Pacific
 DrawingRoom Allowing for a slight difficulty with the
 trains and a little want of familiarity with the use of
 the
 rougepot it was on the whole a meritorious affair

 Gold My dear Dramaleigh it redounds infinitely to your
 credit

 Lord D One or two judicious innovations I think

 Gold Admirable The cup of tea and the plate of mixed
 biscuits
 were a cheap and effective inspiration

 Lord D Yesmy idea entirely Never been done before

 Gold Pretty little maids the Kings youngest daughters but
 timid

 Lord D Thatll wear off Young

 Gold Thatll wear off Ha here they come by George And
 with
 out the Dragon What can they have done with her

 Enter Nekaya and Kalyba timidly

 Nekaya Oh if you please Lady Sophy has sent us in here
 because
 Zara and Captain Fitzbattleaxe are going on in the
 garden
 in a manner which no wellconducted young ladies ought to
 witness

 Lord D Indeed we are very much obliged to her Ladyship

 Kalyba Are you I wonder why

 Nekaya Dont tell us if its rude

 Lord D Rude Not at all We are obliged to Lady Sophy because
 she
 has afforded us the pleasure of seeing you

 Nekaya I dont think you ought to talk to us like that

 Kalyba Its calculated to turn our heads

 Nekaya Attractive girls cannot be too particular

 Kalyba Oh pray pray do not take advantage of our unprotected
 inno
 cence

 Gold Pray be reassuredyou are in no danger whatever

 Lord D But may I askis this extreme delicacythis shrinking
 sensitivenessa general characteristic of Utopian young
 ladies

 Nekaya Oh no we are crack specimens

 Kalyba We are the pick of the basket Would you mind not coming
 quite so near Thank you

 Nekaya And please dont look at us like that it unsettles us

 Kalyba And we dont like it At least we do like it but its
 wrong

 Nekaya We have enjoyed the inestimable privilege of being
 educated
 by a most refined and easily shocked English lady on the
 very strictest English principles

 Gold But my dear young ladies

 Kalyba Oh dont You mustnt Its too affectionate

 Nekaya It really does unsettle us

 Gold Are you really under the impression that English girls
 are
 so ridiculously demure Why an English girl of the
 highest
 type is the best the most beautiful the bravest and
 the
 brightest creature that Heaven has conferred upon this
 world
 of ours She is frank openhearted and fearless and
 never shows in so favorable a light as when she gives her
 own blameless impulses full play

 Nekaya Oh you shocking story
 and
 Kalyba

 Gold Not at all Im speaking the strict truth Ill tell
 you
 all about her

 SONG  Mr Goldbury

 A wonderful joy our eyes to bless
 In her magnificent comeliness
 Is an English girl of eleven stone two
 And five foot ten in her dancing shoe
 She follows the hounds and on the pounds
 The field tails off and the muffs diminish

 Over the hedges and brooks she bounds
 Straight as a crow from find to finish
 At cricket her kin will lose or win
 She and her maids on grass and clover
 Eleven maids outeleven maids in
 And perhaps an occasional maiden over

 Go search the world and search the sea
 Then come you home and sing with me
 Theres no such gold and no such pearl
 As a bright and beautiful English girl

 With a tenmile spin she stretches her limbs
 She golfs she punts she rows she swims
 She plays she sings she dances too
 From ten or eleven til all is blue
 At ball or drum til small hours come
 Chaperons fans concealing her yawning
 Shell waltz away like a teetotum
 And never go home til daylights dawning
 Lawntennis may share her favours fair
 Her eyes adance and her cheeks aglowing
 Down comes her hair but then what does she care
 Its all her own and its worth the showing
 Go search the world etc

 Her soul is sweet as the ocean air
 For prudery knows no haven there
 To find mockmodesty please apply
 To the conscious blush and the downcast eye
 Rich in the things contentment brings
 In every pure enjoyment wealthy
 Blithe and beautiful bird she sings
 For body and mind are hale and healthy
 Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill
 Her heart is light as a floating feather
 As pure and bright as the mountain rill
 That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather
 Go search the world etc

 QUARTET

 Nek Then I may sing and play

 Lord D You may

 Kal Then I may laugh and shout

 Gold No doubt

 Nek These maxims you endorse

 Lord D Of course

 Kal You wont exclaim Oh fie

 Gold Not I

 Gold Whatever you arebe that
 Whatever you saybe true
 Straightforwardly act
 Be honestin fact
 Be nobody else but you

 Lord D Give every answer pat
 Your character true unfurl
 And when it is ripe
 Youll then be a type
 Of a capital English girl

 All Oh sweet surpriseoh dear delight
 To find it undisputed quite
 All musty fusty rules despite
 That Art is wrong and Nature right

 Nek When happy I
 With laughter glad
 Ill wake the echoes fairly
 And only sigh
 When I am sad
 And that will be but rarely

 Kal Ill row and fish
 And gallop soon
 No longer be a prim one
 And when I wish
 To hum a tune
 It neednt be a hymn one

 Gold and Lord D No no
 It neednt be a hymn one

 All dancing Oh sweet surprise and dear delight
 To find it undisputed quite
 All musty fusty rules despite
 That Art is wrong and Nature right

 Dance and
 off
 Enter Lady Sophy

 RECITATIVE  Lady Sophy

 Oh would some demon power the gift impart
 To quell my overconscientious heart
 Unspeak the oaths that never had been spoken
 And break the vows that never should be broken

 SONG  Lady Sophy

 When but a maid of fifteen year
 Unsoughtunplighted
 Short petticoatedand I fear
 Still shortersighted
 I made a vow one early spring
 That only to some spotless King
 Who proof of blameless life could bring
 Id be united
 For I had read not long before
 Of blameless kings in fairy lore
 And thought the race still flourished here
 Well well
 I was a maid of fifteen year

 The King enters and overhears this verse

 Each morning I pursued my game
 An early riser
 For spotless monarchs I became
 An advertiser
 But all in vain I searched each land
 So kingless to my native strand
 Returned a little older and
 A good deal wiser

 I learnt that spotless King and Prince
 Have disappeared some ages since
 Even Paramounts angelic grace
 Ah me
 Is but a mask on Natures face
 King comes forward

 King Ah Lady Sophythen you love me
 For so you sing

 Lady S Indignant and surprise Producing Palace Peeper
 No by the stars that shine above me
 Degraded King
 For while these rumours through the city bruited
 Remain uncontradicted unrefuted
 The object thou of my aversion rooted
 Repulsive thing

 King Be justthe time is now at hand
 When truth may published be
 These paragraphs were written and
 Contributed by me

 Lady S By you No no

 King Yes yes I swear by me
 I caught in Scaphios ruthless toil
 Contributed the lot

 Lady S That that is why you did not boil
 The author on the spot

 King And that is why I did not boil
 The author on the spot

 Lady S I couldnt think why you did not boil

 King But I know why I did not boil
 The author on the spot

 DUET  Lady Sophy and King

 Lady S Oh the rapture unrestrained
 Of a candid retractation
 For my sovereign has deigned
 A convincing explanation
 And the clouds that gathered oer
 All have vanished in the distance
 And the Kings of fairy lore
 One at least is in existence

 King Oh the skies are blue above
 And the earth is red and rosal
 Now the lady of my love
 Has accepted my proposal
 For that asinorum pons
 I have crossed without assistance
 And of prudish paragons
 One at least is in existence

 King and Lady Sophy dance gracefully While this is going on Lord
 Dramaleigh enters unobserved with Nekaya and Capt
 Fitzbattleaxe The
 two girls direct Zaras attention to the King and Lady Sophy
 who
 are still dancing affectionately together At this point the
 King kisses Lady Sophy which causes the Princesses to make an
 exclamation The King and Lady Sophy are at first much
 confused at
 being detected but eventually throw off all reserve and the
 four couples break into a wild Tarantella and at the end
 exeunt
 severally

 Enter all the male Chorus in great excitement for various
 entrances
 led by Scaphio Phantis and Tarara and followed by the
 female
 Chorus

 CHORUS

 Upon our seagirt land
 At our enforced command
 Reform has laid her hand
 Like some remorseless ogress
 And made us darkly rue
 The deeds she dared to do
 And all is owing to
 Those hated Flowers of Progress

 So down with them
 So down with them
 Reforms a hated ogress
 So down with them
 So down with them
 Down with the Flowers of Progress

 Flourish Enter King his three daughters Lady Sophy and the
 Flowers
 of Progress

 King What means this most unmannerly irruption
 Is this your gratitude for boons conferred

 Scaphio Boons Bah A fico for such boons say we
 These boons have brought Utopia to a standstill
 Our pride and boastthe Army and the Navy
 Have both been reconstructed and remodeled
 Upon so irresistible a basis
 That all the neighboring nations have disarmed
 And Wars impossible Your County Councillor
 Has passed such drastic Sanitary laws
 That all doctors dwindle starve and die
 The laws remodeled by Sir Bailey Barre
 Have quite extinguished crime and litigation
 The lawyers starve and all the jails are let
 As model lodgings for the workingclasses
 In shortUtopia swamped by dull Prosperity
 Demands that these detested Flowers of Progress
 Be sent about their business and affairs
 Restored to their original complexion

 King to Zara My daughter this is a very unpleasant state
 of
 things What is to be done

 Zara I dont knowI dont understand it We must have
 omitted
 something

 King Omitted something Yes thats all very well but
 Sir
 Bailey Barre whispers to Zara

 Zara suddenly Of course Now I remember Why I had
 forgot
 ten the most essential element of all

 King And that is

 Zara Government by Party Introduce that great and glorious
 elementat once the bulwark and foundation of Englands
 greatnessand all will be well No political measures
 will
 endure because one Party will assuredly undo all that
 the
 other Party has done and while grouse is to be shot and
 foxes worried to death the legislative action of the
 coun
 try will be at a standstill Then there will be sickness
 in
 plenty endless lawsuits crowded jails interminable
 confu
 sion in the Army and Navy and in short general and
 unex
 ampled prosperity

 All Ulahlica Ulahlica

 Phantis aside Baffled

 Scaphio But an hour will come

 King Your hour has come alreadyaway with them and let them
 wait my will Scaphio and Phantis are led off in
 custody
 From this moment Government by Party is adopted with all
 its attendant blessings and henceforward Utopia will no
 longer be a Monarchy Limited but what is a great deal
 better a Limited Monarchy

 FINALE

 Zara Theres a little group of isles beyond the wave
 So tiny you might almost wonder where it is
 That nation is the bravest of the brave
 And cowards are the rarest of all rarities
 The proudest nations kneel at her command
 She terrifies all foreignborn rapscallions
 And holds the peace of Europe in her hand
 With half a score invincible battalions

 Such at least is the tale
 Which is born on the gale
 From the island which dwells in the sea
 Let us hope for her sake
 That she makes no mistake
 That shes all the professes to be

 King Oh may we copy all her maxims wise
 And imitate her virtues and her charities
 And may we by degrees acclimatize
 Her Parliamentary peculiarities
 By doing so we shall in course of time
 Regenerate completely our entire land
 Great Britain is the monarchy sublime
 To which some add others do not Ireland
 Such at least is the tale etc

 No 1 When maiden loves she sits and sighs
 INTRODUCTION and SONG
 Phoebe

 PHOEBE When maiden loves she sits and sighs
 She wanders to and fro
 Unbidden teardrops fill her eyes
 And to all questions she replies
 With a sad Heighho

 Tis but a little wordHeighho
 So soft tis scarcely heardHeighho
 An idle breath
 Yet life and death
 May hang upon a maids Heighho

 When maiden loves she mopes apart
 As owl mopes on a tree
 Although she keenly feels the smart
 She cannot tell what ails her heart
 With its sad Ah me

 Tis but a foolish sighAh me
 Born but to droop and dieAh me
 Yet all the sense
 Of eloquence
 Lies hidden in a maids Ah me

 Yet all the sense
 Of eloquence
 Lies hidden in a maids Ah me
 Ah me Ah me

 Yet all the sense
 Of eloquence
 Lies hidden in a maids Ah me

 PHOEBE weeps

 Enter WILFRED

 WILFRED Mistress Meryll

 PHOEBE looking up Eh Oh its you is it You may go
 awayif you like Because I dont want you you know

 WILFRED Havent you anything to say to me

 PHOEBE Oh yes Are the birds all caged The wild beasts all
 littered down All the locks chains bolts and bars
 in good order Is the Little Ease sufficiently
 comfortable The racks pincers and thumbscrews all
 ready for work Ugh you brute

 WILFRED These allusions to my professional duties are in
 doubtful taste I didnt become a headjailer because
 I like headjailing I didnt become an assistant
 tormentor because I like assistanttormenting We
 cant all be sorcerers you know PHOEBE is annoyed
 Ah you brought that upon yourself

 PHOEBE Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer Hes a man of
 science and an alchemist

 WILFRED Well whatever he is he wont be one for long for
 hes to be beheaded today for dealings with the
 devil His master nearly had him last night when the
 fire broke out in the Beauchamp pronounced Beecham
 Tower

 PHOEBE Oh how I wish he had escaped in the confusion But
 take care theres still time for a reply to his
 petition for mercy

 WILFRED Ah Im content to chance that This evening at half
 past seven ah Gesture of chopping off a head

 PHOEBE Youre a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
 death of a young and handsome soldier

 WILFRED Young and handsome How do you know hes young and
 handsome

 PHOEBE Because Ive seen him every day for weeks past taking
 his exercise on the Beauchamp pronounced Beecham
 Tower

 WILFRED Curse him

 PHOEBE There I believe youre jealous of him now Jealous
 of a man Ive never spoken to Jealous of a poor soul
 whos to die in an hour

 WILFRED I am Im jealous of everybody and everything Im
 jealous of the very words I speak to you because they
 reach your ears and I mustnt go near em

 PHOEBE How unjust you are Jealous of the words you speak to
 me Why you know as well as I do that I dont even
 like them

 WILFRED You used to like em

 PHOEBE I used to pretend I like them It was mere politeness
 to comparative strangers

 Exit PHOEBE with spinning wheel

 WILFRED I dont believe you know what jealousy is I dont
 believe you know how it eats into a mans heart and
 disorders his digestion and turns his interior into
 boiling lead Oh you are a heartless jade to trifle
 with the delicate organization of the human interior

 No 1A When jealous torments
 OPTIONAL SONG
 Wilfred

 WILFRED When jealous torments rack my soul
 My agonies I cant control
 Oh better sit on red hot coal
 Than love a heartless jade

 The red hot coal will hurt no doubt
 But red hot coals in time die out
 But jealousy you can not rout
 Its fires will never fade

 Its much less painful on the whole
 To go and sit on red hot coal
 Til youre completely flayed
 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
 Your wretched bones upon the rack
 Than love a heartless jade
 Than love a heartless jade

 The kerchief on your neck of snow
 I look on as a deadly foe
 It goeth where I dare not go
 And stops there all day long

 The belt that holds you in its grasp
 Is to my peace of mind a rasp
 It claspeth what I can not clasp
 Correct me if Im wrong

 Its much less painful on the whole
 To go and sit on red hot coal
 Til youre completely flayed
 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
 Your wretched bones upon the rack
 Than love a heartless jade
 Than love a heartless jade

 The bird that breakfasts on your lip
 I would I had him in my grip
 He sippeth where I dare not sip
 I cant get over that

 The cat you fondle soft and sly
 He layeth where I dare not lie
 Were not on terms that cat and I
 I do not like that cat

 Its much less painful on the whole
 To go and sit on red hot coal
 Til youre completely flayed
 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
 Your wretched bones upon the rack
 Than love a heartless jade
 Than love a heartless jade

 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
 Your wretched bones upon the rack
 Than love a heartless jade

 DAME A good day to you

 2ND
 YEOMAN Good day Dame Carruthers Busy today

 DAME Busy aye the fire in the Beauchamp pronounced
 Beecham last night has given me work enough A dozen
 poor prisoners Richard Colfax Sir Martin Byfleet
 Colonel Fairfax Warren the preacherpoet and halfa
 score others all packed into one small cell not six
 feet square Poor Colonel Fairfax whos to die to
 day is to be removed to no 14 in the Cold Harbour
 that he may have his last hour alone with his
 confessor and Ive to see to that

 2ND
 YEOMAN Poor gentleman Hell die bravely I fought under him
 two years since and he valued his life as it were a
 feather

 PHOEBE Hes the bravest the handsomest and the best young
 gentleman in England He twice saved my fathers life
 and its a cruel thing a wicked thing and a
 barbarous thing that so gallant a hero should lose his
 head for its the handsomest head in England

 DAME For dealings with the devil Aye if all were beheaded
 who dealt with him thered be busy things on Tower
 Green

 PHOEBE You know very well that Colonel Fairfax is a student
 of alchemy nothing more and nothing less but this
 wicked Tower like a cruel giant in a fairytale must
 be fed with blood and that blood must be the best and
 bravest in England or its not good enough for the
 old Blunderbore Ugh

 DAME Silence you silly girl you know not what you say I
 was born in the old keep and Ive grown grey in it
 and please God I shall die and be buried in it and
 theres not a stone in its walls that is not as dear
 tome as my right hand


 No 3 When our gallant Norman foes
 SONG WITH CHORUS
 Dame Carruthers and Yeomen

 DAME When our gallant Norman foes
 Made our merry land their own
 And the Saxons from the Conqueror were flying

 At his bidding it arose
 In its panoply of stone
 A sentinel unliving and undying

 Insensible I trow
 As a sentinel should be
 Though a queen to save her head should
 come asuing
 Theres a legend on its brow
 That is eloquent to me
 And it tells of duty done and duty doing

 The screw may twist and the rack may turn
 And men may bleed and men may burn
 Oer London town and its golden hoard
 I keep my silent watch and ward

 CHORUS The screw may twist and the rack may turn
 Oer London town and all its hoard
 And men may bleed and men may burn
 Oer London town and all its hoard
 Oer London town and its golden hoard
 I keep my silent watch and ward

 DAME Within its wall of rock
 The flower of the brave
 Have perished with a constancy unshaken
 From the dungeon to the block
 From the scaffold to the grave
 Is a journey many gallant hearts have taken

 And the wicked flames may hiss
 Round the heroes who have fought
 For conscience and for home in all its beauty
 But the grim old fortalice
 Takes little heed of aught
 That comes not in the measure of its duty

 The screw may twist and the rack may turn
 And men may bleed and men may burn
 Oer London town and its golden hoard
 I keep my silent watch and ward

 CHORUS The screw may twist and the rack may turn
 Oer London town and all its hoard
 And men may bleed and men may burn
 Oer London town and all its hoard
 Oer London town and its golden hoard
 I keep my silent watch and ward

 Exeunt all but PHOEBE Enter SERGEANT MERYLL

 Leonard who as a reward for his valour in saving his
 standard and cutting his way through fifty foes who
 would have hanged him has been appointed a Yeoman of
 the Guard will arrive today and as he comes
 straight from Windsor where the Court is it may be

 with him

 PHOEBE Oh that he may

 MERYLL Amen to that For the Colonel twice saved my life and
 Id give the rest of my life to save his And wilt

 brain but thourt a good lass

 PHOEBE Yes thats all very well but if Leonard is going to

 one but go through the world with my lips pursed up
 and my eyes cats down like a poor nun who has
 renounced mankind why as I have not renounced

 OPTIONAL SONG
 Sergeant Meryll

 MERYLL A laughing boy but yesterday
 A merry urchin blithe and gay
 Whose joyous shout came ringing out
 Unchecked by care or sorrow

 Today a warrior all sunbrown
 When deeds of soldierly renown
 Are not the boast of London town
 A veteran tomorrow today a warrior
 A veteran tomorrow

 When at my Leonards deeds sublime
 A soldiers pulse beats double time
 And grave hearts thrill as brave hearts will
 At tales of martial glory

 I burn with flush of pride and joy
 A pride unbittered by alloy
 To find my boy my darling boy
 The theme of song and story
 To find my darling boy
 The theme of song and story
 To find my boy my darling boy
 The theme of song and story

 PHOEBE Oh see after they bring the poor gentleman from the
 Beauchamp pronounced Beecham Oh father his hour

 MERYLL No no they lead him to the Cold Harbour Tower to
 await his end in solitude But softly the Lieutenant
 approaches He should not see thee weep

 Enter FAIRFAX guarded by YEOMEN The LIEUTENANT enters
 meeting him

 LIEUT Halt Colonel Fairfax my old friend we meet but
 sadly

 FAIRFAX Sir I greet you with all goodwill and I thank you
 for the zealous acre with which you have guarded me
 from the pestilent dangers which threaten human life
 outside In this happy little community Death when
 he comes doth so in punctual and businesslike
 fashion and like a courtly gentleman giveth due
 notice of his advent that one may not be taken
 unawares

 LIEUT Sir you bear this bravely as a brave man should

 FAIRFAX Why sir it is no light boon to die swiftly and
 surely at a given hour and in a given fashion Truth
 to tell I would gladly have my life but if that may
 not be I have the next best thing to it which is
 death Believe me sir my lot is not so much amiss

 PHOEBE aside to MERYLL Oh father father I cannot bear
 it

 MERYLL My poor lass

 FAIRFAX Nay pretty one why weepest thou Come be comforted
 Such a life as mine is not worth weeping for sees
 MERYLL Sergeant Meryll is it not to LIEUTENANT
 May I greet my old friend Shakes MERYLLs hand
 MERYLL begins to weep Why man whats all this Thou
 and I have faced the grim old king a dozen times and
 never has his majesty come to me in such goodly
 fashion Keep a stout heart good fellow we are
 soldiers and we know how to die thou and I Take my
 word for it it is easier to die well than to live
 well for in sooth I have tried both

 No 5 Is life a boon
 BALLAD
 Fairfax

 FAIRFAX Is life a boon
 If so it must befall
 That Death wheneer he call
 Must call too soon
 Though fourscore years he give
 Yet one would pray to live
 Another moon
 What kind of plaint have I
 Who perish in July
 who perish in July
 I might have had to die
 Perchance in June
 I might have had to die
 Perchance in June

 Is life a thorn
 Then count it not a whit
 Nay count it not a whit
 Man is well done with it
 Soon as hes born
 He should all means essay
 To put the plague away
 And I warworn
 Poor captured fugitive
 My life most gladly give
 I might have had to live
 Another morn
 I might have had to live
 Another morn

 At the end PHOEBE is led off weeping by MERYLL

 FAIRFAX And now Sir Richard I have a boon to beg I am in
 this strait for no better reason than because my
 kinsman Sir Clarence Poltwhistle one of the
 Secretaries of State has charged me with sorcery in
 order that he may succeed in my estate which devolves
 to him provided I die unmarried

 LIEUT As thou wilt most surely do

 FAIRFAX Nay as I will most surely not do by your worships
 grace I have a mind to thwart this good cousin of
 mine

 LIEUT How

 FAIRFAX By marrying forthwith to be sure

 LIEUT But heaven ha mercy whom wouldst thou marry

 FAIRFAX Nay I am indifferent on that score Coming Death hath
 made of me a true and chivalrous knight who holds all
 womankind in such esteem that the oldest and the
 meanest and the worstfavoured of them is good enough
 for him So my good Lieutenant if thou wouldst serve
 a poor soldier who has but an hour to live find me
 the first that comes my confessor shall marry us and
 her dower shall be my dishonoured name and a hundred
 crowns to boot No such poor dower for an hour of
 matrimony

 LIEUT A strange request I doubt that I should be warranted
 in granting it

 FAIRFAX There never was a marriage fraught with so little of
 evil to the contracting parties In an hour shell be
 a widow and I a bachelor again for aught I know

 LIEUT Well I will see what can be done for I hold thy
 kinsman in abhorrence for the scurvy trick he has
 played thee

 FAIRFAX A thousand thanks good sir we meet again in this
 spot in an hour or so I shall be a bridegroom then
 and your worship will wish me joy Till then
 farewell To GUARD I am ready good fellows

 Exit with GUARD into Cold Harbour Tower

 LIEUT He is a brave fellow and it is a pity that he should
 die Now how to find him a bride at such short
 notice Well the task should be easy Exit

 will satisfy you for we are merry folk who would make
 all merry as ourselves For look you there is humour

 ELSIE struggling with 1ST CITIZEN Hands off I say
 unmannerly fellow she boxes his ears

 POINT to 1ST CITIZEN Ha Didst thou hear her say Hands
 off

 1ST
 CITIZEN Aye I heard her say it and I felt her do it What
 then

 POINT Thou dost not see the humour of that

 1ST
 CITIZEN Nay if I do hang me

 POINT Thou dost not Now observe She said Hands off
 Whose hands Thine Off whom Off her Why Because
 she is a woman Now had she not been a woman thine
 hands had not been set upon her at all So the reason
 for the laying on of hands is the reason for the
 taking off of hands and herein is contradiction
 contradicted It is the very marriage of pro with con
 and no such lopsided union either as times go for
 pro is not more unlike con than man is unlike woman
 yet men and women marry every day with none to say
 Oh the pity of it but I and fools like me Now

 POINT It is sung to the moon
 By a lovelorn loon
 Who fled from the mocking throng O

 Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
 Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
 As he sighed for the love of a ladye
 Heighdy heighdy
 Misery melackadaydee
 He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb
 As he sighed for the love of a ladye

 ELSIE I have a song to sing O

 POINT Sing me your song O

 ELSIE It is sung with the ring
 Of the songs maids sing
 Who love with a love lifelong O
 Its the song of a merrymaid peerly proud
 Who loved a lord and who laughed aloud
 At the moan of the merryman moping mum
 Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
 Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
 As he sighed for the love of a ladye

 POINT I have a song to sing O

 ELSIE Sing me your song O

 POINT It is sung to the knell
 Of a churchyard bell
 And a doleful dirge ding dong O
 Its a song of a popinjay bravely born
 Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
 At the humble merrymaid peerly proud
 Who loved a lord and who laughed aloud
 At the moan of the merryman moping mum
 Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
 Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
 As he sighed for the love of a ladye
 Heighdy heighdy

 ELSIE I have a song to sing O

 POINT Sing me your song O

 ELSIE It is sung with a sigh
 And a tear in the eye
 For it tells of a righted wrong O
 Its a song of the merrymaid once so gay
 Who turned on her heel and tripped away
 From the peacock popinjay bravely born
 Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
 At the humble heart that he did not prize
 So she begged on her knees with downcast eyes
 For the love of the merryman moping mum
 Whose soul was sad and whose glance was glum
 Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
 As he sighed for the love of a ladye

 beheaded in an hour on this very spot For sufficient
 reasons he desires to marry before he dies and he
 hath asked me to find him a wife Wilt thou be that

 POINT Why sir look you I am concerned in this for though
 I am not yet wedded to Elsie Maynard time works
 wonders and theres no knowing what may be in store
 for us Have we your worships word for it that this
 gentleman will die today

 LIEUT Nothing is more certain I grieve to say

 instant the ceremony is at an end

 LIEUT The very instant I pledge my honour that it shall be
 so

 POINT An hundred crowns

 TRIO
 Elsie Point and Lieutenant

 LIEUT How say you maiden will you wed
 A man about to lose his head
 For half an hour
 Youll be his wife
 And then the dower
 Is your for life
 A headless bridegroom why refuse
 If truth the poets tell
 Most bridegrooms ere they marry
 Lose both head and heart as well

 ELSIE A strange proposal you reveal
 It almost makes my senses reel
 Alas Im very poor indeed
 And such a sum I sorely need
 My mother sir is like to die
 This money life may bring
 Bear this in mind I pray
 If I consent to do this thing

 POINT Though as a general rule of life
 I dont allow my promised wife
 My lovely bride that is to be
 To marry anyone but me
 Yet if the fee is promptly paid
 And he in wellearned grave
 Within the hour is duly laid
 Objection I will waive
 Yes objection I will waive

 ALL Temptation oh temptation
 Were we I pray intended
 To shun what eer our station
 Your fascinations splendid
 Or fall wheneer we view you
 Head over heels into you
 Head over heels Head over heels
 Head over heels into you
 Head over heels Head over heels
 Head over heels Right into you
 Head over heels Head over heels etc
 Temptation oh temptation

 During this the LIEUTENANT has whispered to WILFRED
 who has entered WILFRED binds ELSIEs eyes with a
 kerchief and leads her into the Cold Harbour Tower

 LIEUT And so good fellow you are a jester

 POINT Aye sir and like some of my jests out of place

 LIEUT I have a vacancy for such an one Tell me what are
 your qualifications for such a post

 POINT Marry sir I have a pretty wit I can rhyme you
 extempore I can convulse you with quip and
 conundrumI have the lighter philosophies at my
 tongues tip I can be merry wise quaint grim and
 sardonic one by one or all at once I have a pretty
 turn for anecdote I know all the jests ancient and
 modern past present and to come I can riddle you
 from dawn of day to set of sun and if that content
 you not well on to midnight and the small hours Oh
 sir a pretty wit I warrant you a pretty pretty
 wit


 No 9 Ive jibe and joke
 SONG
 Point

 POINT Ive jibe and joke
 And quip and crank
 For lowly folk
 And men of rank
 I ply my craft
 And know no fear
 But aim my shaft
 At prince or peer
 At peer or prince at prince or peer
 I aim my shaft and know no fear

 Ive wisdom from the East and from the West
 Thats subject to no academic rule
 You may find it in the jeering of a jest
 Or distil it from the folly of a fool
 I can teach you with a quip if Ive a mind
 I can trick you into learning with a laugh
 Oh winnow all my folly folly folly and
 youll find
 A grain or two of truth among the chaff
 Oh winnow all my folly folly folly and
 youll find
 A grain or two of truth among the chaff

 I can set a braggart quailing with a quip
 The upstart I can wither with a whim
 He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip
 But his laughter has an echo that is grim
 When theyre offered to the world in merry
 guise
 Unpleasant truths are swallowed with a will
 For he whod make his fellow
 fellow fellow creatures wise
 Should always gild the philosophic pill
 For he whod make his fellow
 fellow fellow creatures wise
 Should always gild the philosophic pill

 LIEUT And how came you to leave your last employ

 POINT Why sir it was in this wise My Lord was the
 Archbishop of Canterbury and it was considered that
 one of my jokes was unsuited to His Graces family
 circle In truth I ventured to ask a poor riddle
 sir Wherein lay the difference between His Grace and
 poor Jack Point His Grace was pleased to give it up
 sir And thereupon I told him that whereas His Grace
 was paid 10000 a year for being good poor Jack Point
 was good for nothing Twas but a harmless jest but
 it offended His Grace who whipped me and set me in
 the stocks for a scurril rogue and so we parted I
 had as lief not take post again with the dignified
 clergy

 LIEUT But I trust you are very careful not to give offence
 I have daughters

 POINT Sir my jests are most carefully selected and
 anything objectionable is expunged If your honour
 pleases I will try then first on your honours
 chaplain

 LIEUT Can you give me an example Say that I had sat me down
 hurriedly on something sharp

 POINT Sir I should say that you had sat down on the spur of
 the moment

 LIEUT Humph I dont think much of that Is that the best
 you can do

 POINT It has always been much admired sir but we will try
 again

 LIEUT Well then I am at dinner and the joint of meat is
 but half cooked

 POINT Why then sir I should say that what is underdone
 cannot be helped

 LIEUT I see I think that manner of thing would be somewhat
 irritating

 POINT At first sir perhaps but use is everything and you
 would come in time to like it

 LIEUT We will suppose that I caught you kissing the kitchen
 wench under my very nose

 POINT Under her very nose good sir not under yours That
 is where I would kiss her Do you take me Oh sir a
 pretty wit a pretty pretty wit

 LIEUT The maiden comes Follow me friend and we will
 discuss this matter at length in my library

 POINT I am your worships servant That is to say I trust
 I soon shall be But before proceeding to a more
 serious topic can you tell me sir why a cooks
 brainpan is like an overwound clock

 LIEUT A truce to this fooling follow me

 POINT Just my luck my best conundrum wasted

 Exeunt LIEUTENANT and POINT Enter ELSIE from Tower led
 by WILFRED who removes the bandage from her eyes and
 exits

 No 10 Tis done I am a bride
 RECITATIVE AND SONG
 Elsie

 ELSIE Tis done I am a bride Oh little ring
 That bearest in thy circlet all the gladness
 That lovers hope for and that poets sing
 What bringest thou to me but gold and sadness
 A bridegroom all unknown save in this wise
 Today he dies Today alas he dies

 Though tear and longdrawn sigh
 Ill fit a bride
 No sadder wife than I
 The whole world wide
 Ah me Ah me
 Yet maids there be
 Who would consent to lose
 The very rose of youth
 The flowr of life
 To be in honest truth
 A wedded wife
 No matter whose
 No matter whose

 Ah me what profit we
 O maids that sigh
 Though gold though gold should live
 If wedded love must die

 Ere half an hour has rung
 A widow I
 Ah heaven he is too young
 Too brave to die
 Ah me Ah me
 Yet wives there be
 So weary worn I trow
 That they would scarce complain
 So that they could
 In half an hour attain
 To widowhood
 No matter how
 No matter how

 O weary wives
 Who widowhood would win
 Rejoice rejoice that ye have time
 To weary in

 O weary wives
 Who widowhood would win
 Rejoice rejoice rejoice
 that ye have time
 O weary weary wives rejoice

 Exit ELSIE as WILFRED reenters

 WILFRED looking after ELSIE Tis an odd freak for a dying
 man and his confessor to be closeted alone with a
 strange singing girl I would fain have espied them
 but they stopped up the keyhole My keyhole

 Enter PHOEBE with SERGEANT MERYLL MERYLL remains in the
 background unobserved by WILFRED

 PHOEBE aside Wilfred and alone

 WILFRED Now what could he have wanted with her Thats what
 puzzles me

 PHOEBE aside Now to get the keys from him

 Aloud Wilfred has no reprieve arrived

 WILFRED None Thine adored Fairfax is to die

 PHOEBE Nay thou knowest that I have naught but pity for the
 poor condemned gentleman

 WILFRED I know that he who is about to die is more to thee
 than I who am alive and well

 PHOEBE Why that were out of reason dear Wilfred Do they
 not say that a live ass is better than a dead lion
 No I didnt mean that

 WILFRED Oh they say that do they

 PHOEBE Its unpardonably rude of them but I believe they put
 it in that way Not that it applies to thee who art
 clever beyond all telling

 WILFRED Oh yes as an assistanttormentor

 PHOEBE Nay as a wit as a humorist as a most philosophic
 commentator on the vanity of human resolution

 PHOEBE slyly takes bunch of keys from WILFREDs waistband
 and hands them to MERYLL who enters the Tower unnoticed
 by WILFRED

 WILFRED Truly I have seen great resolution give way under my
 persuasive methods working with a small thumbscrew
 In the nice regulation of a thumbscrew in the
 hundredth part of a single revolution lieth all the
 difference between stony reticence and a torrent of
 impulsive unbosoming that the pen can scarcely follow
 Ha ha I am a mad wag

 PHOEBE with a grimace Thou art a most lighthearted and
 delightful companion Master Wilfred Thine anecdotes
 of the torturechamber are the prettiest hearing

 WILFRED Im a pleasant fellow an I choose I believe I am the
 merriest dog that barks Ah we might be passing happy
 together

 PHOEBE Perhaps I do not know

 WILFRED For thou wouldst make a most tender and loving wife

 PHOEBE Aye to one whom I really loved For there is a wealth
 of love within this little heart saving up for I
 wonder whom Now of all the world of men I wonder
 whom To think that he whom I am to wed is now alive
 and somewhere Perhaps far away perhaps close at
 hand And I know him not It seemeth that I am wasting
 time in not knowing him

 WILFRED Now say that it is I nay suppose it for the nonce
 Say that we are wed suppose it only say that thou
 art my very bride and I thy cherry joyous bright
 frolicsome husband and that the days work being
 done and the prisoners stored away for the night
 thou and I are alone together with a long long
 evening before us

 PHOEBE with a grimace It is a pretty picture but I
 scarcely know It cometh so unexpectedly and yetand
 yet were I thy bride

 WILFRED Aye wert thou my bride

 PHOEBE Oh how I would love thee


 No 11 Were I thy bride
 SONG
 Phoebe

 PHOEBE Were I thy bride
 Then all the world beside
 Were not too wide
 To hold my wealth of love
 Were I thy bride

 Upon thy breast
 My loving head would rest
 As on her nest
 The tender turtle dove
 Were I thy bride

 This heart of mine
 Would be one heart with thine
 And in that shrine
 Our happiness would dwell
 Were I thy bride

 And all day long
 Our lives should be a song
 No grief no wrong
 Should make my heart rebel
 Were I thy bride

 The silvery flute
 The melancholy lute
 Were nightowls hoot
 To my lowwhispered coo
 Were I thy bride

 The skylarks trill
 Were but discordance shrill
 To the soft thrill
 Of wooing as Id woo
 Were I thy bride

 MERYLL reenters gives keys to PHOEBE who replaces
 them at WILFREDs girdle unnoticed by him Exit
 MERYLL

 The roses sigh
 Were as a carrions cry
 To lullaby
 Such as Id sing to thee
 Were I thy bride

 A feathers press
 Were leaden heaviness to my caress
 But then of course you see
 Im not thy bride

 Exit PHOEBE

 WILFRED No thourt not not yet But Lord how she wood I
 should be no mean judge of wooing seeing that I have
 been more hotly wood than most men I have been wood
 by maid widow and wife I have been wood boldly
 timidly tearfully shyly by direct assault by
 suggestion by implication by inference and by
 innuendo But this wooing is not of the common order
 it is the wooing of one who must needs me if she die
 for it

 Exit WILFRED Enter SERGEANT MERRILL cautiously from
 Tower

 MERYLL looking after them The deed is so far safely
 accomplished The slyboots how she wheedled him What
 a helpless ninny is a lovesick man He is but as a
 lute in a womans hands she plays upon him whatever
 tune she will But the Colonel comes I faith hes
 just in time for the Yeomen parade here for his
 execution in two minutes

 Enter FAIRFAX without beard and moustache and dressed in
 Yeomans uniform

 FAIRFAX My good and kind friend thou runnest a grave risk for
 me

 MERYLL Tut sir no risk Ill warrant none here will
 recognise you You make a brave Yeoman sir So this
 ruff is too high so and the sword should hang thus
 Here is your halbert sir carry it thus The Yeomen
 come Now remember you are my brave son Leonard
 Meryll

 FAIRFAX If I may not bear mine own name there is none other
 I would bear so readily

 FAIRFAX aside Truly I was to be pitied
 Having but an hour to live

 Favoured too by lucky star

 Enter JACK POINT in low spirits reading from a huge
 volume

 POINT reads The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose No
 7863The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor A certayne
 poor wit being anhungered did meet a wellfed
 councillorMarry fool quothe the councillor
 whither away In truth said the poor wag in
 that I have eaten naught these two dayes I do wither
 away and that right rapidly The Councillor laughed
 hugely and gave him a sausage Humph the councillor
 was easier to please than my new master the
 Lieutenant I would like to take post under that
 councillor Ah tis but melancholy mumming when poor
 heartbroken jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
 Hugh Ambrose for original light humour

 Enter WILFRED also in low spirits

 WILFRED sighing Ah Master Point

 POINT changing his manner Ha friend jailer Jailer that
 wast jailer that never shalt be more Jailer that
 jailed not or that jailed if jail he did so
 unjailery that twas but jerryjailing or jailing in
 joke though no joke to him who by unjailerlike
 jailing did so jeopardise his jailership Come take
 heart smile laugh wink twinkle thou tormentor
 that tormentest none thou racker that rackest not
 thou pincher out of place come take heart and be
 merry as I am aside dolefully as I am

 WILFRED Aye its well for thee to laugh Thou hast a good
 post and hast cause to be merry

 POINT bitterly Cause Have we not all cause Is not the
 world a big butt of humour into which all who will
 may drive a gimlet See I am a salaried wit and is
 there aught in nature more ridiculous A poor dull
 heartbroken man who must needs be merry or he will
 be whipped who must rejoice lest he starve who must
 jest you jibe you quip you crank you wrack you
 riddle you from hour to hour from day to day from
 year to year lest he dwindle perish starve
 pineand die Why when theres naught else to laugh
 at I laugh at myself till I ache for it

 WILFRED Yet I have often thought that a jesters calling would
 suit me to a hair

 POINT Thee Would suit thee thou deaths head and cross
 bones

 WILFRED Aye I have a pretty wit a light airy joysome wit
 spiced with anecdotes of prison cells and the torture
 chamber Oh a very delicate wit I have tried it on
 many a prisoner and there have been some who smiled
 Now it is not easy to make a prisoner smile And it
 should not be difficult to be a good jester seeing
 that thou are one

 POINT Difficult Nothing easier Nothing easier Attend and
 I will prove it to thee

 No 14 Oh a private buffoon is a lighthearted loon
 SONG
 Point

 POINT Oh a private buffoon is a lighthearted loon
 If you listen to popular rumour
 From morning to night hes so joyous and bright
 And he bubbles with wit and good humour
 Hes so quaint and so terse
 Both in prose and in verse
 Yet though people forgive his transgression
 There are one or two rules that all family fools
 Must observe if they love their profession
 There are one or two rules
 Halfadozen maybe
 That all family fools
 Of whatever degree
 Must observe if they love their profession

 If you wish to succeed as a jester youll need
 To consider each persons auricular
 What is all right for B would quite scandalize C
 For C is so very particular
 And D may be dull and Es very thick skull
 Is as empty of brains as a ladle
 While F is F sharp and will cry with a carp
 That hes known your best joke from his cradle
 When your humour they flout
 You cant let yourself go
 And it does put you out
 When a person says Oh
 I have known that old joke from my cradle

 If your master is surly from getting up early
 And tempers are short in the morning
 An inopportune joke is enough to provoke
 Him to give you at once a months warning
 Then if you refrain he is at you again
 For he likes to get value for money
 Hell ask then and there with an insolent stare
 If you know that youre paid to be funny
 It adds to the tasks
 Of a merrymans place
 When your principal asks
 With a scowl on his face
 If you know that youre paid to be funny

 Comes a Bishop maybe or a solemn DD
 Oh beware of his anger provoking
 Better not pull his hair
 Dont stick pins in his chair
 He wont understand practical joking
 If the jests that you crack have an orthodox smack
 You may get a bland smile from these sages
 But should it by chance be imported from France
 Halfacrown is stopped out of your wages
 Its a general rule
 Tho your zeal it may quench
 If the Family Fool
 Makes a joke thats too French
 Halfacrown is stopped out of his wages

 Though your head it may rack with a bilious attack
 And your senses with toothache youre losing
 And youre mopy and flat
 they dont fine you for that
 If youre properly quaint and amusing
 Though your wife ran away with a soldier that day
 And took with her your trifle of money
 Bless your heart they dont mind
 theyre exceedingly kind
 They dont blame youas long as youre funny
 Its a comfort to feel
 If your partner should flit
 Though you suffer a deal
 They dont mind it a bit
 They dont blame youso long as youre funny

 POINT And so thou wouldst be a jester eh

 WILFRED Aye

 POINT Now listen My sweetheart Elsie Maynard was
 secretly wed to this Fairfax half an hour ere he
 escaped

 WILFRED She did well

 POINT She did nothing of the kind so hold thy peace and
 perpend Now while he liveth she is dead to me and I
 to her and so my jibes and jokes notwithstanding I
 am the saddest and the sorriest dog in England

 WILFRED Thou art a very dull dog indeed

 POINT Now if thou wilt swear that thou didst shoot this
 Fairfax while he was trying to swim across the river
 it needs but the discharge of an arquebus on a dark
 night and that he sank and was seen no more Ill
 make thee the very Archbishop of jesters and that in
 two daystime Now what sayest thou

 WILFRED I am to lie

 POINT Heartily But thy lie must be a lie of circumstance
 which I will support with the testimony of eyes
 earsand tongue

 WILFRED And thou wilt qualify me as a jester

 POINT As a jester among jesters I will teach thee all my
 original songs my selfconstructed riddles my own
 ingenious paradoxes nay more I will reveal to thee
 the source whence I get them Now what sayest thou

 WILFRED Why if it be but a lie thou wantest of me I hold it
 cheap enough and I say yes it is a bargain

 No 15 Hereupon were both agreed
 DUET
 Point and Wilfred

 BOTH Hereupon were both agreed
 All that we two
 Do agree to
 Well secure by solemn deed
 To prevent all
 Error mental

 POINT You on Elsie are to call
 With a story
 Grim and gory

 I declare to
 Youre to swear to

 Enter FAIRFAX

 FAIRFAX Two days gone and no news of poor Fairfax The dolts
 They seek him everywhere save within a dozen yards of
 his dungeon So I am free Free but for the cursed
 haste with which I hurried headlong into the bonds of
 matrimony with Heaven knows whom As far as I
 remember she should have been young but even had not
 her face been concealed by her kerchief I doubt
 whether in my then plight I should have taken much
 note of her Free Bah The Tower bonds were but a
 thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters
 which I fool that I was placed upon mine own hands
 From the one I broke readily enough how to break the
 other


 No 16 Free from his fetters grim
 BALLAD
 Fairfax

 FAIRFAX Free from his fetters grim
 Free to depart
 Free both in life and limb
 In all but heart
 Bound to an unknown bride
 For good and ill
 Ah is not one so tied
 A prisner still a prisner still
 Ah is not one so tied
 A prisner still

 Free yet in fetters held
 Till his last hour
 Gyves that no smith can weld
 No rust devour
 Although a monarchs hand
 Had set him free
 Of all the captive band
 The saddest he the saddest he
 Of all the captive band
 The saddest saddest he

 FAIRFAX Mistress Elsie

 ELSIE Master Leonard

 FAIRFAX So thou leavest us tonight

 ELSIE Yes Master Leonard I have been kindly tended and I
 almost fear I am loth to go

 FAIRFAX And this Fairfax Wast thou glad when he escaped

 ELSIE Why truly Master Leonard it is a sad thing that a
 young and gallant gentleman should die in the very
 fullness of his life

 FAIRFAX Then when thou didst faint in my arms it was for joy
 at his safety

 ELSIE It may be so I was highly wrought Master Leonard
 and I am but a girl and so when I an highly wrought
 I faint

 FAIRFAX Now dost thou know I am consumed with a parlous
 jealousy

 ELSIE Thou And of whom

 FAIRFAX Why of this Fairfax surely

 ELSIE Of Colonel Fairfax

 FAIRFAX Aye Shall I be frank with thee Elsie I love thee
 ardently passionately ELSIE alarmed and surprised
 Elsie I have loved thee these two days which is a
 long time and I would fain join my life to thine

 ELSIE Master Leonard Thou art jesting

 FAIRFAX Jesting May I shrivel into raisins if I jest I love
 thee with a love that is a fever with a love that is
 a frenzy with a love that eateth up my heart What
 sayest thou Thou wilt not let my heart be eaten up

 ELSIE aside Oh mercy What am I to say

 FAIRFAX Dost thou love me or hast thou been insensible these
 two days

 ELSIE I love all brave men

 FAIRFAX Nay there is love in excess I thank heaven there are
 many brave men in England but if thou lovest them
 all I withdraw my thanks

 ELSIE I love the bravest best But sir I may not listen

 FAIRFAX Thou a wife Whose His name His hours are
 numberednay his grave is dug and his epitaph set up

 ELSIE Oh sir keep my secret it is the only barrier that
 Fate could set up between us My husband is none other
 than Colonel Fairfax

 FAIRFAX The greatest villain unhung The most illfavoured
 illmannered illnatured illomened illtempered
 dog in Christendom

 ELSIE It is very like He is naught to me for I never saw
 him I was blindfolded and he was to have died within
 the hour and he did not die and I am wedded to him
 and my heart is broken

 FAIRFAX He was to have died and he did not die The
 scoundrel The perjured traitorous villain Thou
 shouldst have insisted on his dying first to make
 sure Tis the only way with these Fairfaxes

 ELSIE I now wish I had

 FAIRFAX aside Bloodthirsty little maiden

 soldiers speak to poor girls Oh for shame for

 FAIRFAX Why an arquebus
 Fired from the wharf unless I much mistake

 MERYLL Strange and at such an hour What can it mean

 Enter CHORUS excitedly

 CHORUS Now what can that have been
 A shot so late at night
 Enough to cause a fright
 What can the portent mean

 Are foemen in the land
 Is London to be wrecked
 What are we to expect
 What danger is at hand
 Let us understand
 What danger is at hand

 LIEUTENANT enters also POINT and WILFRED

 LIEUT Who fired that shot At once the truth declare

 WILFRED My lord twas I to rashly judge forebear

 POINT My lord twas he to rashly judge forebear

 WILFRED Like a ghost his vigil keeping

 POINT Or a spectre allappalling

 WILFRED I beheld a figure creeping

 POINT I should rather call it crawling

 WILFRED He was creeping

 POINT He was crawling

 WILFRED He was creeping creeping

 POINT Crawling

 WILFRED He was creeping

 POINT He was crawling

 WILFRED He was creeping creeping

 POINT Crawling

 WILFRED Not a moments hesitation
 I myself upon him flung
 With a hurried exclamation
 To his draperies I hung
 Then we closed with one another
 In a roughandtumble smother
 Colnel Fairfax and no other
 Was the man to whom I clung

 ALL Colnel Fairfax and no other
 Was the man to whom he clung

 WILFRED After mighty tug and tussle

 POINT It resembled more a struggle

 WILFRED He by dint of stronger muscle

 POINT Or by some infernal juggle

 WILFRED From my clutches quickly sliding

 POINT I should rather call it slipping

 WILFRED With a view no doubt of hiding

 POINT Or escaping to the shipping

 WILFRED With a gasp and with a quiver

 POINT Id describe it as a shiver

 WILFRED Down he dived into the river
 And alas I cannot swim

 ALL Its enough to make one shiver
 With a gasp and with a quiver
 Down he dived into the river
 It was very brave of him

 WILFRED Ingenuity is catching
 With the view my King of pleasing
 Arquebus from sentry snatching

 POINT I should rather call it seizing

 WILFRED With an ounce or two of lead
 I dispatched him through the head

 ALL With an ounce or two of lead
 He dispatched him through the head

 WILFRED I discharged it without winking
 Little time I lost in thinking
 Like a stone I saw him sinking

 POINT I should say a lump of lead

 ALL He discharged it without winking
 Little time he lost in thinking

 WILFRED Like a stone I saw him sinking

 POINT I should say a lump of lead

 WILFRED Like a stone my boy I said

 POINT Like a heavy lump of lead

 WILFRED Like a stone my boy I said

 POINT Like a heavy lump of lead

 WILFRED Anyhow the man is dead
 Whether stone or lump of lead

 ALL Anyhow the man is dead
 Whether stone or lump of lead
 Arquebus from sentry seizing
 With the view his King of pleasing
 Arquebus from sentry seizing
 With the view his King of pleasing
 Wilfred shot him through the head
 And hes very very dead

 And it matters very little
 Whether stone or lump of lead
 It is very very certain that
 hes very very dead

 LIEUT The river must be dragged no time be lost
 The body must be found at any cost
 To this attend without undue delay
 So set to work with what dispatch ye may

 Exit LIEUTENANT

 ALL Yes yes
 Well set to work with what dispatch we may

 Men raise WILFRED and carry him off on their shoulders

 ALL Hail the valiant fellow who
 Did this deed of derringdo

 By my head twas bravely done

 Now by my head twas bravely done

 Exeunt all but ELSIE POINT FAIRFAX and PHOEBE

 POINT to ELSIE who is weeping Nay sweetheart be
 comforted This Fairfax was but a pestilent fellow
 and as he had to die he might as well die thus as
 any other way Twas a good death

 ELSIE Still he was my husband and had he not been he was
 nevertheless a living man and now he is dead and so
 by your leave my tears may flow unchidden Master
 Point

 FAIRFAX And thou didst see all this

 POINT Aye with both eyes at once this and that The
 testimony of one eye is naught he may lie But when
 it is corroborated by the other it is good evidence
 that none may gainsay Here are both present in court
 ready to swear to him

 PHOEBE But art thou sure it was Colonel Fairfax Saw you his
 face

 POINT Aye and a plaguey illfavoured face too A very hang
 dog face a felon face a face to fright the headsman
 himself and make him strike awry Oh a plaguey bad
 face take my word for it PHOEBE and FAIRFAX laugh
 How they laugh Tis ever thus with simple folk an
 accepted wit has but to say Pass the mustard and
 they roar their ribs out

 FAIRFAX aside If ever I come to life again thou shalt pay
 for this Master Point

 POINT Now Elsie thou art free to choose again so behold
 me I am young and wellfavoured I have a pretty wit
 I can jest you jibe you quip you crank you wrack
 you riddle you

 FAIRFAX Tush man thou knowest not how to woo Tis not to be
 done with timeworn jests and threadbare sophistries
 with quips conundrums rhymes and paradoxes Tis an
 art in itself and must be studied gravely and
 conscientiously

 No 19 A man who would woo a fair maid
 TRIO
 Elsie Phoebe and Fairfax

 FAIRFAX A man who would woo a fair maid
 Should prentice himself to the trade
 And study all day
 In methodical way
 How to flatter cajole and persuade

 He should prentice himself at fourteen
 And practise from morning to een
 And when hes of age
 If he will Ill engage
 He may capture the heart of a queen
 the heart of a queen

 ALL It is purely a matter of skill
 Which all may attain if they will
 But every Jack
 He must study the knack
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill

 ELSIE If hes made the best use of his time
 His twig hell so carefully lime
 That every bird
 Will come down at his word
 Whatever its plumage and clime

 He must learn that the thrill of a touch
 May mean little or nothing or much
 Its an instrument rare
 To be handled with care
 And ought to be treated as such
 Ought to be treated as such

 ALL It is purely a matter of skill
 Which all may attain if they will
 But every Jack
 He must study the knack
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill

 PHOEBE Then a glance may be timid or free
 It will vary in mighty degree
 From an impudent stare
 To a look of despair
 That no maid without pity can see
 And a glance of despair is no guide
 It may have its ridiculous side
 It may draw you a tear
 Or a box on the ear
 You can never be sure till youve tried
 Never be sure till youve tried

 ALL It is purely a matter of skill
 Which all may attain if they will
 But every Jack
 He must study the knack
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill
 But every Jack
 He must study the knack
 But every Jack
 Must study the knack
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill
 Yes every Jack
 Must study the knack
 If he wants to make sure of his Jill

 FAIRFAX aside to POINT Now listen to me tis done thus
 aloud Mistress Elsie there is one here who as thou
 knowest loves thee right well

 POINT aside That he does right well

 FAIRFAX He is but a man of poor estate but he hath a loving
 honest heart He will be a true and trusty husband to
 thee and if thou wilt be his wife thou shalt lie
 curled up in his heart like a little squirrel in its
 nest

 POINT aside Tis a pretty figure A maggot in a nut lies
 closer but a squirrel will do

 FAIRFAX He knoweth that thou wast a wife an unloved and
 unloving wife and his poor heart was near to
 breaking But now that thine unloving husband is dead
 and thou art free he would fain pray that thou
 wouldst hearken unto him and give him hope that thou
 wouldst one day be his

 PHOEBE alarmed He presses her hands and whispers in her
 ear Ods bodikins what does it mean

 FAIRFAX Now sweetheart tell me wilt thou be this poor
 goodfellows wife

 ELSIE If the good brave man is he a brave man

 FAIRFAX So men say

 POINT aside Thats not true but let it pass

 ELSIE If the brave man will be content with a poor
 penniless untaught maid

 POINT aside Widow but let that pass

 ELSIE I will be his true and loving wife and that with my
 heart of hearts

 FAIRFAX My own dear love Embracing her

 PHOEBE in great agitation Why whats all this Brother

 virtue of my teaching Go thou and apply it

 Opening Chorus and Solos
 Maidens Angela and Ella

 MAIDENS Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Lovesick all against our will
 Twenty years hence we shall be

 And we die for love of thee
 Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Lovesick all against our will

 Twenty lovesick maidens still

 ANGELA Love feeds on hope they say or love will die

 MAIDENS Ah miserie

 ANGELA Yet my love lives although no hope have I

 MAIDENS Ah miserie

 ANGELA Alas poor heart go hide thyself away
 To weeping concords tune thy roundelay
 Ah miserie

 MAIDENS All our love is all for one
 Yet that love he heedeth not
 He is coy and cares for none
 Sad and sorry is our lot
 Ah miserie

 ELLA Go breaking heart
 Go dream of love requited
 Go foolish heart
 Go dream of lovers plighted
 Go madcap heart
 Go dream of never waking
 And in thy dream
 Forget that thou art breaking

 MAIDENS Ah miserie

 ELLA Forget that thou art breaking

 MAIDENS Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Lovesick all against our will
 Twenty years hence we shall be
 Twenty lovesick maidens still
 Ah miserie

 ANGELA There is a strange magic in this love of ours Rivals as
 we all are in the affections of our Reginald the very
 hopelessness of our love is a bond that binds us to one another

 SAPHIR Jealousy is merged in misery While he the very
 cynosure of our eyes and hearts remains icy insensible  what
 have we to strive for

 ELLA The love of maidens is to him as interesting as the
 taxes

 SAPHIR Would that it were He pays his taxes

 ANGELA And cherishes the receipts

 Enter LADY JANE LUE

 SAPHIR Happy receipts All sigh heavily

 JANE LC suddenly Fools They start and turn to her

 ANGELA I beg your pardon

 JANE Fools and blind The man loves  wildly loves

 ANGELA But whom None of us

 JANE No none of us His weird fancy has lighted for the
 nonce on Patience the village milkmaid

 SAPHIR On Patience Oh it cannot be

 JANE Bah But yesterday I caught him in her dairy eating fresh
 butter with a tablespoon Today he is not well

 SAPHIR But Patience boasts that she has never loved  that love
 is to her a sealed book Oh he cannot be serious

 JANE Tis but a fleeting fancy  twill quickly wear away
 aside coming downstage Oh Reginald if you but knew what a
 wealth of golden love is waiting for you stored up in this
 rugged old bosom of mine the milkmaids triumph would be short
 indeed

 PATIENCE appears on an eminence R She looks down with pity on
 the despondent Ladies


 No 2 Still brooding on their mad infatuation
 Recitative
 Patience Saphir Angela and Maidens

 PATIENCE Still brooding on their mad infatuation
 I thank thee Love thou comest not to me
 Far happier I free from thy ministration
 Than dukes or duchesses who love can be

 SAPHIR looking up Tis Patience  happy girl Loved by a
 poet

 PATIENCE Your pardon ladies I intrude upon you Going

 ANGELA Nay pretty child come hither PATIENCE descends Is
 it true that you have never loved

 PATIENCE Most true indeed

 SOPRANOS Most marvelous

 ALTOS And most deplorable


 I cannot tell what this love may be
 Solo
 Patience

 PATIENCE I cannot tell what this love may be
 LC That cometh to all but not to me
 It cannot be kind as theyd imply
 Or why do these ladies sigh

 It cannot be joy and rapture deep
 Or why do these gentle ladies weep
 It cannot be blissful as tis said
 Or why are their eyes so wondrous red

 Though evrywhere true love I see
 Acoming to all but not to me
 I cannot tell what this love may be
 For I am blithe and I am gay
 While they sit sighing night and day

 PATIENCE ALL

 For I am blithe and I am gay Yes she is blithe and she is
 gay
 Think of the gulf twixt Yes she is blithe and
 them and me she is gay
 Think of the gulf twixt them Yes she is blithe and
 and me and she is gay
 Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
 la la la la la la la la la la la la
 and miserie Ah miserie

 She dances across R and back to RC

 PATIENCE If love is a thorn they show no wit
 Who foolishly hug and foster it
 If love is a weed how simple they
 Who gather it day by day

 If love is a nettle that makes you smart
 Then why do you wear it next your heart
 And if it be none of these say I
 Ah why do you sit and sob and sigh

 Though evrywhere true love I see
 Acoming to all but not to me
 I cannot tell what this love may be
 For I am blithe and I am gay
 While they sit sighing night and day

 PATIENCE ALL

 For I am blithe and I Yes she is blithe and she is
 am gay gay
 Think of the gulf twixt Yes she is blithe and she is
 them and me gay
 Think of the gulf twixt Yes she is blithe and she is
 them and me gay
 Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
 la la la la la la la la la la la la
 and miserie Ah miserie

 ANGELA Ah Patience if you have never loved you have never
 known true happiness All sigh

 PATIENCE C But the truly happy always seem to have so much on
 their minds The truly happy never seem quite well

 JANE coming LC There is a transcendentality of delirium 
 an acute accentuation of supremest ecstasy  which the earthy
 might easily mistake for indigestion But it is not indigestion
  it is aesthetic transfiguration to the others Enough of
 babble Come

 PATIENCE stopping her as she turns to go up C But stay I
 have some news for you The 35th Dragoon Guards have halted in
 the village and are even now on their way to this very spot

 ANGELA The 35th Dragoon Guards

 SAPHIR They are fleshly men of full habit

 ELLA We care nothing for Dragoon Guards

 PATIENCE But bless me you were all engaged to them a year ago

 SAPHIR A year ago

 ANGELA My poor child you dont understand these things A year
 ago they were very well in our eyes but since then our tastes
 have been etherealized our perceptions exalted to the others
 Come it is time to lift up our voices in morning carol to our
 Reginald Let us to his door

 ANGELA leading the Ladies go off two and two Jane last over
 the drawbridge into the castle singing refrain of Twenty
 lovesick maidens and as before accompanying themselves
 on harps etc

 PATIENCE watches them in surprise and with a gesture of
 complete bafflement climbs the rock and goes off the way
 she entered

 The officers of the DRAGOON GUARDS enter R led by the MAJOR
 They form their line across the front of the stage

 Chorus and Solo
 Dragoons and Colonel

 DRAGOONS The soldiers of our Queen
 Are linked in friendly tether
 Upon the battle scene
 They fight the foe together

 There evry mothers son
 Prepared to fight and fall is
 The enemy of one

 On an order from the MAJOR they fall back

 COLONEL If you want a receipt for this soldierlike paragon

 Swagger of Roderick heading his clan
 The keen penetration of Paddington Pollaky
 Grace of an Odalisque on a divan

 COLONEL Well here we are once more on the scene of our former
 triumphs But wheres the Duke

 Enter DUKE listlessly and in low spirits

 DUKE Here I am Sighs

 COLONEL Come cheer up dont give way

 DUKE Oh for that Im as cheerful as a poor devil can be
 expected to be who has the misfortune to be a Duke with a
 thousand a day

 MAJOR Humph Most men would envy you

 DUKE Envy me Tell me Major are you fond of toffee

 MAJOR Very

 COLONEL We are all fond of toffee

 ALL We are

 DUKE Yes and toffee in moderation is a capital thing But to
 live on toffee  toffee for breakfast toffee for dinner toffee
 for tea  to have it supposed that you care for nothing but
 toffee and that you would consider yourself insulted if anything
 but toffee were offered to you  how would you like that

 COLONEL I can quite believe that under those circumstances
 even toffee would become monotonous

 DUKE For toffee read flattery adulation and abject
 deference carried to such a pitch that I began at last to
 think that man was born bent at an angle of fortyfive degrees
 Great heavens what is there to adulate in me Am I particularly
 intelligent or remarkably studious or excruciatingly witty or
 unusually accomplished or exceptionally virtuous

 COLONEL Youre about as commonplace a young man as ever I saw

 ALL You are

 DUKE Exactly Thats it exactly That describes me to a T
 Thank you all very much Shakes hands with the Colonel Well
 I couldnt stand it any longer so I joined this secondclass
 cavalry regiment In the army thought I I shall be
 occasionally snubbed perhaps even bullied who knows The
 thought was rapture and here I am

 COLONEL looking off Yes and here are the ladies

 DUKE But who is the gentleman with the long hair

 COLONEL I dont know

 DUKE He seems popular

 COLONEL He does seem popular

 The DRAGOONS back up R watching the entrance of the Ladies
 BUNTHORNE enters LUE followed by the Ladies two and
 two playing on harps as before He is composing a poem
 and is quite absorbed He sees no one but walks across the
 stage followed by the Ladies who take no notice of the
 DRAGOONS  to the surprise and indignation of those
 officers

 Bunthorne the Ladies following comes slowly down L and then
 crosses the stage to R


 No 4 In a doleful train
 Chorus and Solos
 Maidens Ella Angela Saphir Dragoons and Bunthorne

 MAIDENS In a doleful train
 Two and two we walk all day
 For we love in vain
 None so sorrowful as they
 Who can only sigh and say
 Woe is me alackaday
 Woe is me alackaday

 DRAGOONS Now is not this ridiculous and is not this
 preposterous
 A thoroughpaced absurdity  explain it if you
 can
 Instead of rushing eagerly to cherish us and foster us
 They all prefer this melancholy literary man
 Instead of slyly peering at us
 Casting looks endearing at us
 Blushing at us flushing at us flirting with a fan
 Theyre actually sneering at us fleering at us
 jeering at us
 Pretty sort of treatment for a military man
 Theyre actually sneering at us fleering at us
 jeering at us
 Pretty sort of treatment for a military man

 Bunthorne C

 ANGELA R of BUNTHORNE Mystic poet hear our prayer
 Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Young and wealthy dark and fair
 All of county family
 And we die for love of thee
 Twenty lovesick maidens we

 MAIDENS Yes we die for love of thee
 Twenty lovesick maidens we

 BUNTHORNE crossing to L Though my book I seem to scan
 In a rapt ecstatic way
 Like a literary man
 Who despises female clay
 I hear plainly all they say
 Twenty lovesick maidens they

 BUNTHORNE crosses to C

 DRAGOONS to each other He hears plainly all they say
 Twenty lovesick maidens they

 SAPHIR L of BUNTHORNE Though so excellently wise
 For a moment mortal be
 Deign to raise thy purple eyes
 From thy heartdrawn poesy
 Twenty lovesick maidens see
 Each is kneeling on her knee

 All kneel

 MAIDENS Twenty lovesick maidens see
 Each is kneeling on her knee

 BUNTHORNE going R Though as I remarked before
 Any one convinced would be
 That some transcendental lore
 Is monopolizing me
 Round the corner I can see
 Each is kneeling on her knee

 DRAGOONS Round the corner he can see
 Each is kneeling on her knee

 Now is not this ridiculous and is not this preposterous
 A thoroughpaced absurdity  ridiculous
 preposterous
 Explain it if you can

 MAIDENS DRAGOONS

 In a doleful train Now is not this ridiculous
 Two and two we walk all day and is not this preposterous
 A thoroughpaced absurdity
 None so sorrowful as they explain it if you can

 For we love in vain Instead of rushing eagerly
 None so sorrowful as they to cherish us and foster us
 They all prefer this
 melancholy literary man

 Who can only sigh and say Instead of slyly peering at us
 Casting looks endearing at us
 Blushing at us flushing at us
 Flirting with a fan

 Woe is me alackaday Theyre actually sneering at us
 fleering at us jeering at us
 Pretty sort of treatment for
 a military man

 Woe is me alackaday Theyre actually sneering at us
 fleering at us jeering at us
 Pretty sort of treatment for
 a military man

 Twenty lovesick maidens we Now is not this ridiculous
 and is not this preposterous

 literary man

 And we die for love of thee Now is not this ridiculous

 They all prefer this melancholy
 Yes we die for love of thee melancholy literary man
 Now is not this ridiculous
 and is not this preposterous


 COLONEL RC Angela what is the meaning of this

 ANGELA C Oh sir leave us our minds are but illtuned to
 light lovetalk

 MAJOR LC But what in the world has come over you all

 JANE LC Bunthorne He has come over us He has come among
 us and he has idealized us

 DUKE Has he succeeded in idealizing you

 JANE He has

 DUKE Good old Bunthorne

 JANE My eyes are open I droop despairingly I am soulfully
 intense I am limp and I cling

 During this BUNTHORNE is seen in all the agonies of composition
 The Ladies are watching him intently as he writhes At last
 he hits on the word he wants and writes it down A general
 sense of relief

 BUN Finished At last Finished

 He staggers overcome with the mental strain into the arms of
 the COLONEL

 COLONEL Are you better now

 BUN Yes  oh its you  I am better now The poem is
 finished and my soul has gone out into it That was all It
 was nothing worth mentioning it occurs three times a day

 Sees PATIENCE who has entered during this scene

 Ah Patience Dear Patience

 Holds her hand she seems frightened

 ANGELA Will it please you read it to us sir

 SAPHIR This we supplicate All kneel

 BUN Shall I

 DRAGOONS No

 BUN annoyed  to PATIENCE I will read it if you bid me

 PATIENCE much frightened You can if you like

 BUN It is a wild weird fleshy thing yet very tender very
 yearning very precious It is called Oh Hollow Hollow
 Hollow

 PATIENCE Is it a hunting song

 BUN A hunting song No it is not a hunting song It is the
 wail of the poets heart on discovering that everything is
 commonplace To understand it cling passionately to one another
 and think of faint lilies
 They do so as he recites

 OH HOLLOW HOLLOW HOLLOW

 What time the poet hath hymned
 The writhing maid lithelimbed
 Quivering on amaranthine asphodel
 How can he paint her woes
 Knowing as well he knows
 That all can be set right with calomel

 When from the poets plinth
 The amorous colocynth
 Yearns for the aloe faint with rapturous thrills
 How can he hymn their throes
 Knowing as well he knows
 That they are only uncompounded pills

 Is it and can it be
 Nature hath this decree
 Nothing poetic in the world shall dwell
 Or that in all her works
 Something poetic lurks
 Even in colocynth and calomel
 I cannot tell

 He goes off LUE All turn and watch him not speaking until
 he has gone

 ANGELA How purely fragrant

 SAPHIR How earnestly precious

 PATIENCE Well it seems to me to be nonsense

 SAPHIR Nonsense yes perhaps  but oh what precious nonsense

 COLONEL This is all very well but you seem to forget that you
 are engaged to us

 SAPHIR It can never be You are not Empyrean You are not
 Della Cruscan You are not even Early English Oh be Early
 English ere it is too late

 Officers look at each other in astonishment

 JANE looking at uniform Red and Yellow Primary colors Oh
 South Kensington

 DUKE We didnt design our uniforms but we dont see how they
 could be improved

 JANE No you wouldnt Still there is a cobwebby grey velvet
 with a tender bloom like cold gravy which made Florentine
 fourteenth century trimmed with Venetian leather and Spanish
 altar lace and surmounted with something Japanese  it matters
 not what  would at least be Early English Come maidens

 Exeunt Maidens LUE two and two singing refrain of Twenty
 lovesick maidens we PATIENCE goes off L The Officers
 watch the Ladies go off in astonishment


 No 4a Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Chorus
 Maidens

 As the MAIDENS depart the DRAGOONS spread across the stage

 MAIDENS Twenty lovesick maidens we
 Lovesick all against our will
 Twenty years hence we shall be
 Twenty lovesick maidens still
 Ah miserie

 DUKE Gentlemen this is an insult to the British uniform

 COLONEL A uniform that has been as successful in the courts of
 Venus as on the field of Mars


 No 5 When I first put this uniform on
 Solo and Chorus
 Colonel and Dragoons

 The DRAGOONS form their original line

 Song  COLONEL

 When I first put this uniform on
 I said as I looked in the glass
 Its one to a million
 That any civilian
 My figure and form will surpass
 Gold lace has a charm for the fair
 And Ive plenty of that and to spare
 While a lovers professions
 When uttered in Hessians
 Are eloquent evrywhere
 A fact that I counted upon
 When I first put this uniform on

 Chorus of DRAGOONS

 By a simple coincidence few
 Could ever have counted upon
 The same thing occurred to me
 When I first put this uniform on

 COL I said when I first put it on
 It is plain to the veriest dunce
 That every beauty
 Will feel it her duty
 To yield to its glamour at once
 They will see that Im freely goldlaced
 In a uniform handsome and chaste
 But the peripatetics
 Of longhaired aesthetics
 Are very much more to their taste
 Which I never counted upon
 When I first put this uniform on

 CHORUS By a simple coincidence few
 Could ever have reckoned upon
 I didnt anticipate that
 When I first put this uniform on

 The DRAGOONS go off angrily R

 Enter BUNTHORNE LUE who changes his manner and becomes
 intensely melodramatic


 No 6 Am I alone and unobserved
 Recitative and Solo
 Bunthorne

 BUN Upstage he looks off L and R
 Am I alone
 And unobserved I am
 comes down
 Then let me own
 Im an aesthetic sham
 and walks tragically to downstage C

 This air severe
 Is but a mere
 Veneer

 This cynic smile
 Is but a wile
 Of guile

 This costume chaste
 Is but good taste
 Misplaced

 Let me confess
 A languid love for Lilies does not blight me
 Lank limbs and haggard cheeks do not delight me
 I do not care for dirty greens
 By any means
 I do not long for all one sees
 Thats Japanese
 I am not fond of uttering platitudes
 In stainedglass attitudes
 In short my mediaevalisms affectation
 Born of a morbid love of admiration

 Tiptoes upstage looking L and R and comes back down C

 If youre anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line as a
 man of culture rare
 You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms and
 plant them evrywhere
 You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases of
 your complicated state of mind
 The meaning doesnt matter if its only idle chatter of a
 transcendental kind

 And evry one will say
 As you walk your mystic way
 If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me
 Why what a very singularly deep young man this deep young man
 must be

 Be eloquent in praise of the very dull old days which have long
 since passed away
 And convince em if you can that the reign of good Queen Anne
 was Cultures palmiest day
 Of course you will poohpooh whatevers fresh and new and
 declare its crude and mean
 For Art stopped short in the cultivated court of the Empress
 Josephine

 And evryone will say
 As you walk your mystic way
 If thats not good enough for him which is good enough for me
 Why what a very cultivated kind of youth this kind of youth must
 be

 Then a sentimental passion of a vegetable fashion must excite
 your languid spleen
 An attachment a la Plato for a bashful young potato or a not
 tooFrench French bean
 Though the Philistines may jostle you will rank as an apostle in
 the high aesthetic band
 If you walk down Piccadilly with a poppy or a lily in your
 medieval hand

 And evryone will say
 As you walk your flowry way
 If hes content with a vegetable love which would certainly not
 suit me
 Why what a most particularly pure young man this pure young man
 must be

 At the end of his song PATIENCE enters L He sees her

 BUN Ah Patience come hither She comes to him timidly I
 am pleased with thee The bitterhearted one who finds all else
 hollow is pleased with thee For you are not hollow Are you

 PATIENCE No thanks I have dined but  I beg your pardon  I
 interrupt you Turns to go he stops her

 BUN Life is made up of interruptions The tortured soul
 yearning for solitude writhes under them Oh but my heart is
 aweary Oh I am a cursed thing She attempts to escape
 Dont go

 PATIENCE Really Im very sorry

 BUN Tell me girl do you ever yearn

 PATIENCE I earn my living

 BUN impatiently No no Do you know what it is to be heart
 hungry Do you know what it is to yearn for the Indefinable and
 yet to be brought face to face dally with the Multiplication
 Table Do you know what it is to seek oceans and to find
 puddles Thats my case Oh I am a cursed thing She turns
 again Dont go

 PATIENCE If you please I dont understand you  you frighten me

 BUN Dont be frightened  its only poetry

 PATIENCE Well if thats poetry I dont like poetry

 BUN eagerly Dont you aside Can I trust her aloud
 Patience you dont like poetry  well between you and me I
 dont like poetry Its hollow unsubstantial  unsatisfactory
 Whats the use of yearning for Elysian Fields when you know you
 cant get em and would only let em out on building leases if
 you had em

 PATIENCE Sir I

 BUN Patience I have long loved you Let me tell you a secret
 I am not as bilious as I look If you like I will cut my hair
 There is more innocent fun within me than a casual spectator
 would imagine You have never seen me frolicsome Be a good
 girl  a very good girl  and one day you shall If you are
 fond of touchandgo jocularity  this is the shop for it

 PATIENCE Sir I will speak plainly In the matter of love I am
 untaught I have never loved but my greataunt But I am quite
 certain that under any circumstances I couldnt possibly love you

 BUN Oh you think not

 PATIENCE Im quite sure of it Quite sure Quite

 BUN Very good Life is henceforth a blank I dont care what
 becomes of me I have only to ask that you will not abuse my
 confidence though you despise me I am extremely popular with
 the other young ladies

 PATIENCE I only ask that you will leave me and never renew the
 subject

 BUN Certainly Brokenhearted and desolate I go Goes up
 stage suddenly turns and recites

 Oh to be wafted away
 From this black Aceldama of sorrow
 Where the dust of an earthy today
 Is the earth of a dusty tomorrow

 It is a little thing of my own I call it Heart Foam I
 shall not publish it Farewell Patience Patience farewell

 Exit BUNTHORNE

 PATIENCE What on earth does it all mean Why does he love me
 Why does he expect me to love him going R Hes not a
 relation It frightens me

 Enter ANGELA L

 ANGELA Why Patience what is the matter

 PATIENCE Lady Angela tell me two things Firstly what on
 earth is this love that upsets everybody and secondly how is
 it to be distinguished from insanity

 ANGELA Poor blind child Oh forgive her Eros Why love is
 of all passions the most essential It is the embodiment of
 purity the abstraction of refinement It is the one unselfish
 emotion in this whirlpool of grasping greed

 PATIENCE Oh dear oh beginning to cry

 ANGELA Why are you crying

 PATIENCE To think that I have lived all these years without
 having experienced this ennobling and unselfish passion Why
 what a wicked girl I must be For it is unselfish isnt it

 ANGELA Absolutely Love that is tainted with selfishness is no
 love Oh try try try to love It really isnt difficult if
 you give your whole mind to it

 PATIENCE Ill set about it at once I wont go to bed until Im
 head over ears in love with somebody

 ANGELA Noble girl But is it possible that you have never loved
 anybody

 PATIENCE Yes one

 ANGELA Ah Whom

 PATIENCE My greataunt

 ANGELA Greataunts dont count

 PATIENCE Then theres nobody At least  no nobody Not
 since I was a baby But that doesnt count I suppose

 ANGELA I dont know Tell me about it


 No 7 Long years ago fourteen maybe
 Duet
 Patience and Angela

 PATIENCE R Long years ago  fourteen maybe
 When but a tiny babe of four
 Another baby played with me
 My elder by a year or more

 A little child of beauty rare
 With marvlous eyes and wondrous hair
 Who in my childeyes seemed to me
 All that a little child should be

 She goes to ANGELA LC

 Ah how we loved that child and I
 How pure our baby joy
 How true our love  and by the bye
 He was a little boy

 ANGELA Ah old old tale of Cupids touch
 I thought as much  I thought as much
 He was a little boy

 PATIENCE Pray dont misconstrue what I say
 Remember pray  remember pray
 He was a little boy

 ANGELA No doubt Yet spite of all your pains
 The interesting fact remains 
 He was a little boy

 BOTH Ah yes inNo doubt yet spite of all myyour pains
 The interesting fact remains
 He was a little boy
 He was a little boy

 Exit ANGELA L

 PATIENCE RC Its perfectly dreadful to think of the
 appalling state I must be in I had no idea that love was a
 duty No wonder they all look so unhappy Upon my word I
 hardly like to associate with myself I dont think Im
 respectable Ill go at once and fall in love with As she
 turns to go up R GROSVENOR enters RUE She sees him and

 GROS Patience Can it be that you dont recognize me

 PATIENCE down L Recognize you No indeed I dont

 GROS Have fifteen years so greatly changed me

 PATIENCE turning to him Fifteen years What do you mean

 GROS Have you forgotten the friend of your youth your
 Archibald  your little playfellow Oh Chronos Chronos this
 is too bad of you Comes down C

 PATIENCE Archibald Is it possible Why let me look It is
 It is takes his hands It must be Oh how happy I am I
 thought we should never meet again And how youve grown

 GROS Yes Patience I am much taller and much stouter than I
 was

 PATIENCE And how youve improved

 GROS dropping her hands and turning Yes Patience I am very
 beautiful Sighs

 PATIENCE But surely that doesnt make you unhappy

 GROS Yes Patience Gifted as I am with a beauty which
 probably has not its rival on earth I am nevertheless utterly
 and completely miserable

 PATIENCE Oh  but why

 GROS My childlove for you has never faded Conceive then
 the horror of my situation when I tell you that it is my hideous
 destiny to be madly loved at first sight by every woman I come
 across

 PATIENCE But why do you make yourself so picturesque Why not
 disguise yourself disfigure yourself anything to escape this
 persecution

 GROS No Patience that may not be These gifts  irksome as
 they are  were given to me for the enjoyment and delectation of
 my fellowcreatures I am a trustee for Beauty and it is my
 duty to see that the conditions of my trust are faithfully
 discharged

 PATIENCE And you too are a Poet

 GROS Yes I am the Apostle of Simplicity I am called
 Archibald the AllRight  for I am infallible

 PATIENCE And is it possible that you condescend to love such a
 girl as I

 GROS Yes Patience is it not strange I have loved you with a
 Florentine fourteenthcentury frenzy for full fifteen years

 PATIENCE Oh marvelous I have hitherto been deaf to the voice
 of love I seem now to know what love is It has been revealed
 to me  it is Archibald Grosvenor

 GROS Yes Patience it is She goes into his arms

 PATIENCE as in a trance We will never never part

 GROS We will live and die together

 PATIENCE I swear it

 GROS We both swear it

 PATIENCE recoiling from him But  oh horror

 GROS Whats the matter

 PATIENCE Why you are perfection A source of endless ecstasy
 to all who know you

 GROS I know I am Well

 PATIENCE Then bless my heart there can be nothing unselfish in
 loving you

 GROS Merciful powers I never thought of that

 PATIENCE To monopolize those features on which all women love to
 linger It would be unpardonable

 GROS Why so it would Oh fatal perfection again you
 interpose between me and my happiness

 So we dont care  so we dont care

 During this the GIRLS have been buying tickets the Solicitor
 officiating At last JANE presents herself BUNTHORNE

 BUNTHORNE And are you going a ticket for to buy

 JANE surprised Most certainly I am why shouldnt I

 BUNTHORNE aside Oh Fortune this is hard aloud
 Blindfold your eyes
 Two minutes will decide who wins the prize
 GIRLS blindfold themselves


 Chorus of MAIDENS

 Oh Fortune to my aching heart be kind
 Like us thou art blindfolded but not blind
 Just raise your bandage thus Each uncovers one eye that you
 may see
 And give the prize and give the prize to me They cover their
 eyes again

 BUNTHORNE Come Lady Jane I pray you draw the first

 JANE joyfully He loves me best

 BUNTHORNE aside I want to know the worst

 JANE puts her hand in bag to draw ticket PATIENCE enters and
 prevents her

 ALL uncovering their eyes
 What means this interference
 Of this bold girl I pray you make a clearance

 JANE Away with you away with you and to your milkpails go

 BUNTHORNE suddenly She wants a ticket Take a dozen

 PATIENCE No If there be pardon in your breast
 For this poor penitent
 Who with remorseful thought opprest
 Sincerely doth repent
 If you with one so lowly still
 Desire to be allied
 Then you may take me if you will
 For I will be your bride
 She kneels to Bunthorne

 CHORUS Oh shameless one
 Oh boldfaced thing
 Away you run
 Go take your wing
 Oh shameless one
 Oh boldfaced thing
 Away you run
 Go take your wing
 You shameless one
 You boldfaced thing
 Bunthorne raises her

 BUNTHORNE How strong is love For many and many a week
 Shes loved me fondly and has feared to speak
 But Nature for restraint too mighty far
 Has burst the bonds of Art  and here we are

 END OF ACT I




ACT II


 SCENE  A wooded glade with a view of open country in the
 background The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
 distance JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello
 which she has propped up on a treestump L and upon which
 she will presently accompany herself As the Chorus ends
 she speaks

 No 10 On such eyes as maidens cherish
 Opening Chorus

 Maidens

 On such eyes as maidens cherish
 Lest thy fond adorers gaze
 Or incontinently perish
 In their allconsuming rays
 Or incontinently perish
 In their allconsuming rays


 JANE The fickle crew have deserted Reginald and sworn allegiance
 to his rival and all forsooth because he has glanced with
 passing favour on a puling milkmaid Fools Of that fancy he
 will soon weary  and then I who alone am faithful to him
 shall reap my reward But do not dally too long Reginald for
 my charms are ripe Reginald and already they are decaying
 Better secure me ere I have gone too far


 No 11 Sad is that womans lot
 Recitative and Solo
 Jane

 JANE Sad is that womans lot who year by year
 Sees one by one her beauties disappear
 When Time grown weary of her heartdrawn sighs
 Impatiently begins to dim her eyes
 Compelled at last in lifes uncertain gloamings
 To wreathe her wrinkled brow with wellsaved
 combings
 Reduced with rouge lipshade and pearly grey
 To make up for lost time as best she may

 Silvered is the raven hair
 Spreading is the parting straight
 Mottled the complexion fair
 Halting is the youthful gait
 Hollow is the laughter free
 Spectacled the limpid eye
 Little will be left of me
 In the coming bye and bye
 Little will be left of me
 In the coming bye and bye

 Fading is the taper waist
 Shapeless grows the shapely limb
 And although severely laced
 Spreading is the figure trim

 Stouter than I used to be
 Still more corpulent grow I
 There will be too much of me
 In the coming by and bye
 There will be too much of me
 In the coming by and bye

 Exit L carrying her violoncello

 Enter GROSVENOR R followed by MAIDENS two and two playing
 on archaic instruments as in Act I He is reading
 abstractedly as BUNTHORNE did in Act I and pays no
 attention to them


 No 12 Turn oh turn in this direction
 Chorus
 Maidens

 Turn oh turn in this direction
 Shed oh shed a gentle smile
 With a glance of sad perfection
 Our poor fainting hearts beguile

 On such eyes as maidens cherish
 Let thy fond adorers gaze
 Or incontinently perish
 In their allconsuming rays
 Or incontinently perish
 In their allconsuming rays

 GROSVENOR sits R they group themselves around him in a
 formation similar to that which opens Act I

 GROS aside not looking up The old old tale How
 rapturously these maidens love me and how hopelessly He looks
 up Oh Patience Patience with the love of thee in my heart
 what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity
 Alas they will die of hopeless love for me as I shall die of
 hopeless love for thee

 ANGELA Sir will it please you read to us

 GROS sighing Yes child if you will What shall I read

 ANGELA One of your own poems

 GROS One of my own poems Better not my child They will not
 cure thee of thy love All sigh

 ELLA Mr Bunthorne used to read us a poem of his own every day

 SAPHIR And to do him justice he read them extremely well

 GROS Oh did he so Well who am I that I should take upon
 myself to withhold my gifts from you What am I but a trustee
 Here is a decalet  a pure and simple thing a very daisy  a
 babe might understand it To appreciate it it is not necessary
 to think of anything at all

 ANGELA Let us think of nothing at all

 GROS reciting

 Gentle Jane was as good as gold
 She always did as she was told
 She never spoke when her mouth was full
 Or caught bluebottles their legs to pull
 Or spilt plum jam on her nice new frock
 Or put white mice in the eightday clock
 Or vivisected her last new doll
 Or fostered a passion for alcohol
 And when she grew up she was given in marriage
 To a firstclass earl who keeps his carriage

 GROS I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
 in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
 to the cheek of modesty

 ANGELA Not one it is purity itself

 GROS Heres another

 Teasing Tom was a very bad boy
 A great big squirt was his favourite toy
 He put live shrimps in his fathers boots
 And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits
 He punched his poor little sisters heads
 And cayennepeppered their fourpost beds
 He plastered their hair with cobblers wax
 And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs
 The consequence was he was lost totally
 And married a girl in the corps de bally

 The MAIDENS express intense horror

 ANGELA Marked you how grandly  how relentlessly  the damning
 catalogue of crime strode on till Retribution like a poised
 hawk came swooping down upon the WrongDoer Oh it was
 terrible All shudder

 ELLA Oh sir you are indeed a true poet for you touch our
 hearts and they go out to you

 GROS aside This is simply cloying aloud Ladies I am
 sorry to appear ungallant but this is Saturday and you have
 been following me about ever since Monday I should like the
 usual halfholiday I shall take it as a personal favour if you
 will kindly allow me to close early today

 SAPHIR Oh sir do not send us from you

 GROS Poor poor girls It is best to speak plainly I know
 that I am loved by you but I never can love you in return for
 my heart is fixed elsewhere Remember the fable of the Magnet
 and the Churn

 ANGELA wildly But we dont know the fable of the Magnet and
 the Churn

 GROS Dont you Then I will sing it to you


 No 13 A magnet hung in a hardware shop
 Solo and Chorus
 Grosvenor and Maidens

 GROSVENOR A magnet hung in a hardware shop
 And all around was a loving crop
 Of scissors and needles nails and knives
 Offering love for all their lives
 But for iron the magnet felt no whim
 Though he charmed iron it charmed not him
 From needles and nails and knives hed turn
 For hed set his love on a Silver Churn

 MAIDENS A Silver Churn

 GROSVENOR A Silver Churn

 His most aesthetic
 Very magnetic
 Fancy took this turn
 If I can wheedle
 A knife or a needle
 Why not a Silver Churn

 MAIDENS His most aesthetic
 Very magnetic
 Fancy took this turn
 If I can wheedle
 A knife or a needle
 Why not a Silver Churn

 GROSVENOR He rises going C
 And Iron and Steel expressed surprise
 The needles opened their welldrilled eyes
 The penknives felt shut up no doubt
 The scissors declared themselves cut out
 The kettles they boiled with rage tis said
 While evry nail went off its head
 And hither and thither began to roam
 Till a hammer came up and drove them home

 MAIDENS It drove them home

 GROSVENOR It drove them home

 While this magnetic
 Peripatetic
 Lover he lived to learn
 By no endeavour
 Can magnet ever
 Attract a Silver Churn

 MAIDENS While this magnetic
 Peripatetic
 Lover he lived to learn

 MAIDENS and
 GROSVENOR By no endeavour
 Can magnet ever
 Attract a Silver Churn

 They go off in low spirits RUE gazing back at him from time
 to time

 GROS At last they are gone What is this mysterious
 fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across A
 curse on my fatal beauty for I am sick of conquests Goes R

 Enter PATIENCE L Stops LC on seeing GROSVENOR

 GROS Turns and sees her Patience

 PATIENCE I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald I
 wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
 me as fondly as ever

 GROS Love you If the devotion of a lifetime seizing her
 hand

 PATIENCE indignantly Hold Unhand me or I scream He
 releases her If you are a gentleman pray remember that I am
 anothers very tenderly But you do love me dont you

 GROS Madly hopelessly despairingly

 PATIENCE Thats right I never can be yours but thats right

 GROS And you love this Bunthorne

 PATIENCE With a heartwhole ecstasy that withers and scorches
 and burns and stings sadly It is my duty

 GROS Admirable girl But you are not happy with him

 PATIENCE Happy I am miserable beyond description

 GROS Thats right I never can be yours but thats right

 PATIENCE But go now I see dear Reginald approaching
 Farewell dear Archibald I cannot tell you how happy it has made
 me to know that you still love me

 GROS Ah if I only dared advancing towards her

 PATIENCE Sir this language to one who is promised to another
 tenderly Oh Archibald think of me sometimes for my heart is
 breaking He is unkind to me and you would be so loving

 GROS Loving advancing towards her

 PATIENCE Advance one step and as I am a good and pure woman I
 scream tenderly Farewell Archibald sternly Stop there
 tenderly Think of me sometimes angrily Advance at your
 peril Once more adieu

 GROSVENOR sighs gazes sorrowfully at her sighs deeply and
 exits R She bursts into tears

 Enter BUNTHORNE followed by JANE He is moody and
 preoccupied


 In a doleful train
 Solo
 Jane

 JANE In a doleful train
 One and one I walk all day
 For I love in vain
 None so sorrowful as they
 Who can only sigh and say
 Woe is me alackaday

 BUN seeing PATIENCE Crying eh What are you crying about

 PATIENCE Ive only been thinking how dearly I love you

 BUN Love me Bah

 JANE Love him Bah

 BUN to JANE Dont you interfere

 JANE He always crushes me

 PATIENCE going to him What is the matter dear Reginald If
 you have any sorrow tell it to me that I may share it with you
 sighing It is my duty

 BUN snappishly Whom were you talking with just now

 PATIENCE With dear Archibald

 BUN furiously With dear Archibald Upon my honour this is
 too much

 JANE A great deal too much

 BUN angrily to JANE Do be quiet

 JANE Crushed again

 PATIENCE I think he is the noblest purest and most perfect
 being I have ever met But I dont love him It is true that he
 is devotedly attached to me but I dont love him Whenever he
 grows affectionate I scream It is my duty sighing

 BUN I dare say

 JANE So do I I dare say

 PATIENCE Why how could I love him and love you too You cant
 love two people at once

 BUN Oh cant you though

 PATIENCE No you cant I only wish you could

 BUN I dont believe you know what love is

 PATIENCE sighing Yes I do There was a happy time when I
 didnt but a bitter experience has taught me

 BUNTHORNE noticing that JANE is not looking at him goes off
 quickly up R She turns sees him and runs after him


 No 14 Love is a plaintive song
 Solo
 Patience

 PATIENCE Love is a plaintive song
 Sung by a suffring maid
 Telling a tale of wrong
 Telling of hope betrayed
 Tuned to each changing note
 Sorry when he is sad
 Blind to his evry mote
 Merry when he is glad
 Merry when he is glad
 Love that no wrong can cure
 Love that is always new
 That is the love thats pure
 That is the love thats true
 Love that no wrong can cure
 Love that is always new
 That is the love thats pure
 That is the love the love thats true

 Rendering good for ill
 Smiling at evry frown
 Yielding your own selfwill
 Laughing your teardrops down
 Never a selfish whim
 Trouble or pain to stir
 Everything for him
 Nothing at all for her
 Nothing at all for her
 Love that will aye endure
 Though the rewards be few
 That is the love thats pure
 That is the love thats true
 Love that will aye endure
 Though the rewards be few
 That is the love thats pure
 That is the love the love thats true

 At the end of ballad exit PATIENCE L weeping Enter

 They dance off
 L

 Enter DUKE COLONEL and MAJOR R They have abandoned their
 uniforms and are dressed and made up in imitation of
 Aesthetics They have long hair and other signs of
 attachment to the brotherhood As they sing they walk in
 stiff constrained and angular attitudes  a grotesque
 exaggeration of the attitudes adopted by BUNTHORNE and the
 young LADIES in Act I

 Enter DUKE enter MAJOR enter COLONEL Attitude They walk
 to C

 No 16 Its clear that mediaeval art
 Trio
 Duke Major and Colonel

 ALL Its clear that medieval art alone retains its zest
 To charm and please its devotees weve done our little best
 Were not quite sure if all we do has the Early English
 ring
 But as far as we can judge its something like this sort
 of thing
 You hold yourself like this attitude
 You hold yourself like that attitude
 By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
 attitude
 We venture to expect
 That what we recollect
 Though but a part of true High Art will have its due
 effect

 If this is not exactly right we hope you wont upbraid
 You cant get high Aesthetic tastes like trousers ready
 made
 True views on Medieavalism Time alone will bring
 But as far as we can judge its something like this sort
 of thing
 You hold yourself like this attitude
 You hold yourself like that attitude
 By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
 attitude
 To cultivate the trim
 Rigidity of limb
 You ought to get a Marionette and form your style on him
 attitude

 Attitudes change in time to the music

 COLONEL attitude Yes its quite clear that our only chance of
 making a lasting impression on these young ladies is to become as
 aesthetic as they are

 MAJOR attitude No doubt The only question is how far weve
 succeeded in doing so I dont know why but Ive an idea that
 this is not quite right

 DUKE attitude I dont like it I never did I dont see what
 it means I do it but I dont like it

 COLONEL My good friend the question is not whether we like it
 but whether they do They understand these things  we dont
 Now I shouldnt be surprised if this is effective enough  at a
 distance

 MAJOR I cant help thinking were a little stiff at it It
 would be extremely awkward if we were to be struck so

 COLONEL I dont think we shall be struck so Perhaps were a
 little awkward at first  but everything must have a beginning
 Oh here they come Tention

 They strike fresh attitudes as ANGELA and SAPHIR enter L

 ANGELA seeing them Oh Saphir  see  see The immortal
 fire has descended on them and they are of the Inner Brotherhood
  perceptively intense and consummately utter

 The OFFICERS have some difficulty in maintaining their
 constrained attitudes

 SAPHIR in admiration How Botticelian How Fra Angelican Oh
 Art we thank thee for this boon

 COLONEL apologetically Im afraid were not quite right

 ANGELA Not supremely perhaps but oh so all  but
 to SAPHIR Oh Saphir are they not quite too all  but

 SAPHIR They are indeed jolly utter

 MAJOR in agony I wonder what the Inner Brotherhood usually
 recommend for cramp

 COLONEL Ladies we will not deceive you We are doing this at
 some personal inconvenience with a view of expressing the
 extremity of our devotion to you We trust that it is not
 without its effect

 ANGELA We will not deny that we are much moved by this proof of
 your attachment

 SAPHIR Yes your conversion to the principles of Aesthetic Art
 in its highest development has touched us deeply

 ANGELA And if Mr Bunthorne should remain obdurate

 SAPHIR Which we have every reason to believe he will

 MAJOR aside in agony I wish theyd make haste The others
 hush him

 ANGELA We are not prepared to say that our yearning hearts will
 not go out to you

 COLONEL as giving a word of command By sections of threes 
 Rapture All strike a fresh attitude expressive of aesthetic
 rapture

 SAPHIR Oh its extremely good  for beginners its admirable

 MAJOR The only question is who will take who

 COLONEL Oh the Duke chooses first as a matter of course

 DUKE Oh I couldnt thank of it  you are really too good

 COLONEL Nothing of the kind You are a great matrimonial fish
 and its only fair that each of these ladies should have a chance
 of hooking you Its perfectly simple Observe suppose you
 choose Angela I take Saphir Major takes nobody with
 increasing speed Suppose you choose Saphir Major tales Angela
 I take nobody Suppose you choose neither I take Angela Major
 takes Saphir Clear as day

 The officers with obvious relief abandon their aesthetic
 attitudes and with the Ladies dance into position L to

 GROS It is very pleasant to be alone It is pleasant to be
 able to gaze at leisure upon those features which all others may
 gaze upon at their good will Looking at his reflection in
 handmirror Ah I am a very Narcissus

 Enter BUNTHORNE L moodily

 BUN Its no use I cant live without admiration Since
 Grosvenor came here insipidity has been at a premium Ah he is
 there

 GROS Ah Bunthorne Come here  look Very graceful isnt

 GROS taking back the mirror Oh good gracious not that

 GROS And what is amiss

 BUN Ever since you came here you have entirely monopolized the
 attentions of the young ladies I dont like it sir

 GROS My dear sir how can I help it They are the plague of my
 life My dear Mr Bunthorne with your personal disadvantages
 you can have no idea of the inconvenience of being madly loved
 at first sight by every woman you meet

 BUN Sir until you came here I was adored

 GROS Exactly  until I came here Thats my grievance I cut
 everybody out I assure you if you could only suggest some
 means whereby consistently with my duty to society I could
 escape these inconvenient attentions you would earn my
 everlasting gratitude

 BUN I will do so at once However popular it may be with the
 world at large your personal appearance is highly objectionable
 to me

 GROS It is shaking his hand Oh thank you thank you How
 can I express my gratitude

 BUN By making a complete change at once Your conversation
 must henceforth be perfectly matteroffact You must cut your
 hair and have a back parting In appearance and costume you
 must be absolutely commonplace

 GROS decidedly No Pardon me thats impossible

 BUN Take care When I am thwarted I am very terrible

 GROS I cant help that I am a man with a mission And that
 mission must be fulfilled

 BUN I dont think you quite appreciate the consequences of
 thwarting me

 GROS I dont care what they are

 BUN Suppose  I wont go so far as to say that I will do it 
 but suppose for one moment I were to curse you GROSVENOR
 quails Ah Very well Take care

 GROS But surely you would never do that In great alarm

 BUN I dont know It would be an extreme measure no doubt
 Still

 GROS wildly But you would not do it  I am sure you would
 not Throwing himself at BUNTHORNEs knees and clinging to him
 Oh reflect reflect You had a mother once

 BUN Never

 GROS Then you had an aunt BUNTHORNE affected Ah I see
 you had By the memory of that aunt I implore you to pause ere
 you resort to this last fearful expedient Oh Mr Bunthorne
 reflect reflect Weeping

 BUN aside after a struggle with himself I must not allow
 myself to be unmanned aloud It is useless Consent at once
 or may a nephews curse

 GROS Hold Are you absolutely resolved

 BUN Absolutely

 GROS Will nothing shake you

 BUN Nothing I am adamant

 GROS Very good rising Then I yield

 BUN Ha You swear it

 GROS I do cheerfully I have long wished for a reasonable
 pretext for such a change as you suggest It has come at last
 I do it on compulsion

 BUN Victory I triumph

 On bottled beer and chops

 Ill be as I was  interrupted
