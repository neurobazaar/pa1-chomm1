THE STANDARD HOUSEHOLDEFFECT COMPANY


My friend came in the other day before we had left town and looked
round at the appointments of the room in their summer shrouds and said
with a faint sigh I see you have had the eternalwomanly with you
too




I

Isnt the eternalwomanly everywhere What has happened to you
I asked

I wish you would come to my house and see Every rug has been up for a
month and we have been living on bare floors Everything that could be
tied up has been tied up everything that could be sewed up has been
sewed up Everything that could be mothballed and put away in chests
has been mothballed and put away Everything that could be taken down
has been taken down Bags with drawstrings at their necks have been
pulled over the chandeliers and tied The pictures have been hidden in
cheesecloth and the mirrors veiled in gauze so that I cannot see my own
miserable face anywhere

Come Thats something

Yes its something But I have been thinking this matter over very
seriously and I believe it is going from bad to worse I have heard
praises of the thorough housekeeping of our grandmothers but the
housekeeping of their granddaughters is a thousand times more intense

Do you really believe that I asked And if you do what of it

Simply this that if we dont put a stop to it at the gait its going
it will put a stop to the eternalwomanly

I suppose we should hate that

Yes it would be bad It would be very bad and I have been turning the
matter over in my mind and studying out a remedy

The highest type of philosopher turns a thing over in his mind and lets
some one else study out a remedy

Yes I know I feel that I may be wrong in my processes but I am sure
that I am right in my results The reason why our grandmothers could be
such good housekeepers without danger of putting a stop to the eternal
womanly was that they had so few things to look after in their houses
Life was indefinitely simpler with them But the modern improvements
as we call them have multiplied the cares of housekeeping without
subtracting its burdens as they were expected to do Every novel
convenience and comfort every article of beauty and luxury every means
of refinement and enjoyment in our houses has been so much added to the
burdens of housekeeping and the granddaughters have inherited from the
grandmothers an undiminished conscience against rust and the moth which
will not suffer them to forget the least duty they owe to the naughtiest
of their superfluities

Yes I see what you mean I said This is what one usually says when
one does not quite know what another is driving at but in this case I
really did know or thought I did That survival of the conscience is a
very curious thing especially in our eternalwomanly I suppose that
the North American conscience was evolved from the rudimental European
conscience during the first centuries of struggle here and was more or
less religious and economical in its origin But with the advance of
wealth and the decay of faith among us the conscience seems to be simply
conscientious or if it is otherwise it is social The eternalwomanly
continues along the old lines of housekeeping from an atavistic impulse
and no one woman can stop because all the other women are going on It
is something in the air or something in the blood Perhaps it is
something in both

Yes said my friend quite as I had said already I see what you mean
But I think it is in the air more than in the blood I was in Paris
about this time last year perhaps because I was the only thing in my
house that had not been swathed in cheesecloth or tied up in a bag with
drawstrings or rolled up with mothballs and put away in chests At any
rate I was there One day I left my wife in New York carefully tagging
three wornout feather dusters and putting them into a pillowcase and
tagging it and putting the pillowcase into a camphorated selfsealing
paper sack and tagging it and another day I was in Paris dining at the
house of a lady whom I asked how she managed with the things in her house
when she went into the country for the summer Leave them just as they
are she said But what about the dust and the moths and the rust and
the tarnish She said Why the things would have to be all gone over
when I came back in the autumn anyway and why should I give myself
double trouble I asked her if she didnt even roll anything up and put
it away in closets and she said Oh you mean that old American horror
of getting ready to go away I used to go through all that at home too
but I shouldnt dream of it here In the first place there are no
closets in the house and I couldnt put anything away if I wanted to
And really nothing happens I scatter some Persian powder along the
edges of things and under the lower shelves and in the dim corners and
I pull down the shades When I come back in the fall I have the powder
swept out and the shades pulled up and begin living again Suppose a
little dust has got in and the moths have nibbled a little here and
there The whole damage would not amount to half the cost of putting
everything away and taking everything out not to speak of the weeks of
discomfort and the wear and tear of spirit No thank goodnessI left
American housekeeping in America I asked her But if you went back
and she gave a sigh and said

I suppose I should go back to that along with all the rest Everybody
does it there So you see my friend concluded its in the air
rather than the blood

Then your famous specific is that our eternalwomanly should go and live
in Paris

Oh dear not said my friend Nothing so drastic as all that Merely
the extinction of household property

I see what you mean I said Butwhat do you mean

Simply that hired houses such as most of us live in shall all be
furnished houses and that the landlord shall own every stick in them
and every appliance down to the last spoon and ultimate towel There
must be no compromise by which the tenant agrees to provide his own
linen and silver that would neutralize the effect I intend by the
expropriation of the personal proprietor if that says what I mean It
must be in the lease with severe penalties against the tenant in case of
violation that the landlord into furnish everything in perfect order
when the tenant comes in and is to put everything in perfect order when
the tenant goes out and the tenant is not to touch anything to clean
it or dust it or roll it up in mothballs and put it away in chests
All is to be so sacredly and inalienably the property of the landlord
that it shall constitute a kind of trespass if the tenant attempts to
close the house for the summer or to open it for the winter in the usual
way that houses are now closed and opened Otherwise my scheme would be
measurably vitiated

I see what you mean I murmured Well

Some years ago my friend went on when we came home from Europe we
left our furniture in storage for a time while we rather drifted about
and did not settle anywhere in particular During that interval my wife
opened and closed five furnished houses in two years

And she has lived to tell the tale

She has lived to tell it a great many times She can hardly be kept
from telling it yet But it is my belief that although she brought to
the work all the anguish of a quickened conscience under the influence
of the American conditions she had returned to she suffered far less in
her encounters with either of those furnished houses than she now does
with our own furniture when she shuts up our house in the summer and
opens it for the winter But if there had been a clause in the lease as
there should have been forbidding her to put those houses in order when
she left them life would have been simply a rapture Why in Europe
custom almost supplies the place of statute in such cases and you come
and go so lightly in and out of furnished houses that you do not mind
taking them for a month or a few weeks We are very far behind in this
matter but I have no doubt that if we once came to do it on any extended
scale we should do it as we do everything else we attempt more
perfectly than any other people in the world You see what I mean

I am not sure that I do But go on

I would invert the whole Henry George principle and I would tax
personal property of the household kind so heavily that it would
necessarily pass out of private hands I would make its tenure so costly
that it would be impossible to any but the very rich who are also the
very wicked and ought to suffer

Oh come now

I refer you to your Testament In the end all household property would
pass into the hands of the state

Arent you getting worse and worse

Oh Im not supposing there wont be a long interval when household
property will be in the hands of powerful monopolies and many
millionaires will be made by letting it out to middleclass tenants like
you and me along with the houses we hire of them I have no doubt that
there will be a Standard HouseholdEffect Company which will extend its
relations to Europe and get the household effects of the whole world
into its grasp It will be a fearful oppression and we shall probably
groan under it for generations but it will liberate us from our personal
ownership of them and from the far more crushing weight of the
mothball We shall suffer but

I see what you mean I hastened to interrupt at this point but these
suggestive remarks of yours are getting beyondDo you think you could
defer the rest of your incompleted sentence for a week

Well for not more than a week said my friend with an air of
discomfort in his arrest




II

We shall not suffer so much as we do under our present system said
my friend completing his sentence after the interruption of a week By
this time we had both left town and were taking up the talk again on the
veranda of a seaside hotel As for the eternalwomanly it will be her
salvation from herself When once she is expropriated from her household
effects and forbidden under severe penalties from meddling with those of
the Standard HouseholdEffect Company she will begin to get back her
peace of mind and be the same blessing she was before she began
housekeeping

That may all very well be I assented though I did not believe it and
I found something almost too fantastical in my friends scheme But
when we are expropriated from all our dearest belongings what is to
become of our tender and sacred associations with them

What has become of devotion to the family gods and the worship of
ancestors Once the graves of the dead were at the door of the living
so that libations might be conveniently poured out on them and the
ground where they lay was inalienable because it was supposed to be used
by their spirits as well as their bodies A man could not sell the
bones because he could not sell the ghosts of his kindred Byand by
when religion ceased to be domestic and became social and the service of
the gods was carried on in temples common to all it was found that the
tombs of ones forefathers could be sold without violence to their
spectres I dare say it wouldnt be different in the case of our tender
and sacred associations with tables and chairs pots and pans beds and
bedding pictures and bricabrac We have only to evolve a little
further In fact we have already evolved far beyond the point that
troubles you Most people in modern towns and cities have changed their
domiciles from ten to twenty times during their lives and have not paid
the slightest attention to the tender and sacred associations connected
with them I dont suppose you would say that a man has no such
associations with the house that has sheltered him while he has them
with the stuff that has furnished it

No I shouldnt say that

If anything the house should be dearer than the household gear Yet at
each remove we drag a lengthening chain of tables chairs sideboards
portraits landscapes bedsteads washstands stoves kitchen utensils
and bricabrac after us because as my wife says we cannot bear to
part with them At several times in our own lives we have accumulated
stuff enough to furnish two or three house and have paid a pretty stiff
houserent in the form of storage for the overflow Why I am doing that
very thing now Arent you

I amin a certain degree I assented

We all are we welltodo people as we think ourselves Once my wife
and I revolted by a common impulse against the ridiculous waste and
slavery of the thing We went to the storage warehouse and sent three or
four vanloads of the rubbish to the auctioneer Some of the pieces we
had not seen for years and as each was hauled out for us to inspect and
decide upon we condemned it to the auctionblock with shouts of
rejoicing Tender and sacred associations We hadnt had such light
hearts since we had put everything in storage and gone to Europe
indefinitely as we had when we left those things to be carted out of our
lives forever Not one had been a pleasure to us the sight of every one
had been a pang All we wanted was never to set eyes on them again

I must say you have disposed of the tender and sacred associations
pretty effectually so far as they relate to things in storage But the
things that we have in daily use

It is exactly the same with them Why should they be more to us than
the floors and walls of the houses we move in and move out of with no
particular pathos And I think we ought not to care for them certainly
not to the point of letting them destroy our eternalwomanly with the
anxiety she feels for them She is really much more precious if she
could but realize it than anything she swathes in cheesecloth or wraps
up with mothballs The proof of the fact that the whole thing is a
piece of mere sentimentality is that we may live in a furnished house for
years amid all the accidents of birth and death joy and sorrow and yet
not form the slightest attachment to the furniture Why should we have
tender and sacred associations with a thing we have bought and not with
a thing we have hired

I confess I dont know And do you really think we could liberate
ourselves from our belongings if they didnt belong to us Wouldnt the
eternalwomanly still keep putting them away for summer and taking them
out for winter

At first yes there might be some such mechanical action in her but it
would be purely mechanical and it would soon cease When the Standard
HouseholdEffect Company came down on the temporalmanly with a penalty
for violation of the lease the eternalwomanly would see the folly of
her ways and stop for the eternalwomanly is essentially economical
whatever we say about the dressmakers bills and the very futilities of
putting away and taking out that she now wears herself to a thread with
are founded in the instinct of saving

But I asked wouldnt our household belongings lose a good deal of
character if they didnt belong to us Wouldnt our domestic interiors
become dreadfully impersonal

How many houses now have characterpersonality Most people let the
different dealers choose for them as it is Why not let the Standard
HouseholdEffect Company and finally the state I am sure that either
would choose much more wisely than people choose for themselves in the
few cases where they even seem to choose for themselves In most
interiors the appointments are without fitness taste or sense they are
the mere accretions of accident in the greater number of cases where
they are the result of design they are worse I see what you mean by
character and personality in them You mean the sort of madness that let
itself loose a few years ago in what was called household art and has
since gone to make the junkshops hideous Each of the eternalwomanly
was supposed suddenly to have acquired a talent for decoration and a gift
for the selection and arrangement of furniture and each began to stamp
herself upon our interiors One painted a highshouldered stone bottle
with a stork and stood it at the right corner of the mantel on a scarf
another gilded the bottle and stood it at the left corner and tied the
scarf through its handle One knotted a ribbon around the arm of a
chair another knotted it around the leg In a day an hour a moment
the chairs suddenly became angular cushionless springless and the
sofas were stood across corners or parallel with the fireplace in
slants expressive of the personality of the presiding genius The walls
became all frieze and dado and instead of the simple and dignified
ugliness of the impersonal period our interiors abandoned themselves to a
hysterical chaos full of character Some people had their doors painted
black and the daughter or mother of the house then decorated them with
morningglories I saw such a door in a house I looked at the other day
thinking I might hire it The sight of that black door and its morning
glories made me wish to turn aside and live with the cattle as Walt
Whitman says No the less we try to get personality and character into
our household effects the more beautiful and interesting they will be
As soon as we put the Standard HouseholdEffect Company in possession and
render it a relentless monopoly it will corrupt a competent architect
and decorator in each of our large towns and cities and when you hire a
new house these will be sent to advise with the eternalwomanly
concerning its appointments and tell her what she wants and what she
will like for at present the eternal womanly as soon as she has got a
thing she wants begins to hate it The companys agents will begin by
convincing her that she does not need half the things she has lumbered up
her house with and that every useless thing is an ugly thing even in
the region of pure aesthetics I once asked an Italian painter if he did
not think a certain nobly imagined drawingroom was fine and he said
SI Ma troppa roba There were too many rugs tables chairs sofas
pictures vases statues chandeliers Troppa roba is the vice of all
our household furnishing and it will be the death of the eternalwomanly
if it is not stopped But the corrupt agents of a giant monopoly will
teach the eternalwomanly something of the wise simplicity of the South
and she will end by returning to the ideal of housekeeping as it prevails
among the Latin races whom it began with whom civilization began with
What of a harmless necessary moth or two or even a few fleas

That might be all very well as far as furniture and carpets and curtains
are concerned I said but surely you wouldnt apply it to pictures and
objects of art

I would apply it to them first of all and above all rejoined my
friend hardily Among all the people who buy and own such things there
is not one in a thousand who has any real taste or feeling for them and
the objects they choose are generally such as can only deprave and
degrade them further The pictures statues and vases supplied by the
Standard HouseholdEffect Company would be selected by agents with a real
sense of art and a knowledge of it When the houseletting and house
furnishing finally passed into the hands of the state these things would
be lent from the public galleries or from immense municipal stores for
the purpose

And I suppose you would have ancestral portraits supplied along with the
other pictures I sneered

Ancestral portraits of course said my friend with unruffled temper
So few people have ancestors of their own that they will be very glad to
have ancestral portraits chosen for them out of the collections of the
company or the state The agents of the one or the officers of the
other will study the existing type of family face and will select
ancestors and ancestresses whose modelling coloring and expression
agree with it and will keep in view the race and nationality of the
family whose ancestral portraits are to be supplied so that there shall
be no chance of the grossly improbable effect which ancestral portraits
now have in many cases Yes I see no flaw in the scheme my friend
concluded and no difficulty that cant be easily overcome We must
alienate our household furniture and make it so sensitively and
exclusively the property of some impersonal agencycompany or community
I dont care whichthat any care of it shall be a sort of crime any
sense of responsibility for its preservation a species of incivism
punishable by fine or imprisonment This and nothing short of it will
be the salvation of the eternalwomanly

And the perdition of something even more precious than that

What can be more precious

Individuality

My dear friend demanded my visitor who had risen and whom I was
gradually edging to the door do you mean to say there is any
individuality in such things now What have we been saying about
character

Ah I see what you mean I said

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
