CAPN WARRENS WARDS




CHAPTER I


Ostable screamed the brakeman opening the car door and yelling his
loudest so as to be heard above the rattle of the train and the shriek
of the wind Ostable

The brakemans cap was soaked through his hair was plastered down on
his forehead and in the yellow light from the car lamps his wet nose
glistened as if varnished Over his shoulders the shiny ropes of rain
whipped and lashed across the space between the cars The windows
streamed as each succeeding gust flung its miniature freshet against
them

The passengers in the carthere were but four of themdid not seem
greatly interested in the brakemans announcement The redfaced person
in the seat nearest the rear slept soundly as he had done for the
last hour and a half He had boarded the train at Brockton and after
requesting the conductor not to lemme me git by Bayport Bill at
first favored his fellow travelers with a song and then sank into
slumber

The two elderly men sitting together on the righthand side of the car
droned on in their apparently endless Jeremiad concerning the low price
of cranberries the scarcity of scallops on the flats the reasons why
the fish weirs were a failure nowadays and similar cheerful topics And
in his seat on the left Mr Atwood Graves junior partner in the New
York firm of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves lawyers stirred uneasily on
the lumpy plush cushion looked at his watch then at the timetable in
his hand noted that the train was now seventytwo minutes late and
for at least the fifteenth time mentally cursed the railway company the
whole of Cape Cod from Sandwich to Provincetown and the fates which had
brought him there

The train slowed down in a jerky hiccoughy sort of way and crept
on till the car in which Mr Graves was seated was abreast the lighted
windows of a small station where it stopped Peering through the
waterstreaked pane at the end of his seat the lawyer saw dim
silhouettes of uncertain outline moving about They moved with provoking
slowness He felt that it would be joy unspeakable to rush out there and
thump them into animation The fact that the stately Atwood Graves even
thought of such an undignified proceeding is sufficient indication of
his frame of mind

Then behind the door which the brakeman after announcing the station
had closed again sounded a big laugh The heartiness of it grated on
Mr Gravess nerves What idiot could laugh on such a night as this
aboard a train over an hour late

The laugh was repeated Then the door was flung briskly open and a
man entered the car He was a big man broadshouldered inclined to
stoutness wearing a cloth cap with a visor and a heavy ulster the
collar of which was turned up Through the gap between the open ends of
the collar bristled a short grayish beard The face above the beard and
below the visor was sunburned with little wrinkles about the eyes and
curving lines from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth The upper
lip was shaved and the eyebrows were heavy and grayish black Cap
face and ulster were dripping with water

The newcomer paused in the doorway for an instant evidently to add the
finishing touch to a conversation previously begun

Well I tell you Ezra he called over his shoulder if its too
deep to wade maybe I can swim Fat floats they tell me and Abbie says
Im gettin fleshier every day So long

He closed the door and smiling broadly swung down the aisle The pair
of calamity prophets broke off their lament over the declining fisheries
and greeted him almost jovially

Hello Capn cried one Whats the south shore doin over here in
this flood

Whats the matter Capn demanded the other Broke loose from your
moorins have you Did you ever see such a night in your life

The man in the ulster shook hands with each of his questioners removing
a pair of wet heavy leather gloves as he did so

Dont knows I ever did Dan he answered Couldnt see much of this
one but its colorand thats black I come over this mornin to
attend to some business at the courthousedeeds to some cranberry bog
property I just boughtand Judge Baxter made me go home with him to
dinner Stayed at his house all the afternoon and then his man Ezra
Hallett undertook to drive me up here to the depot Talk about blind
pilotin Whew The Judges horse was a new one not used to the roads
Ezras nearsighted and I couldnt use my glasses count of the rain
Let alone that twas darkern the forehold of Noahs ark Ho ho
Sometimes we was in the ruts and sometimes we was in the bushes I told
Ez wed ought to have fetched along a dipsy lead then maybe we could
get our bearins by soundins Couldnt see em if we did get em
says he No says I but we could taste em Man thats driven
through as much Ostable mud as you have ought to know the taste of every
road in town

Well you caught the train anyhow observed Dan

Yup If wed been crippled as _well_ as blind we could have done that
He seated himself just in front of the pair and glanced across the aisle
at Mr Graves to find the latter looking intently at him

Pretty tough night he remarked nodding

Yes replied the lawyer briefly He did not encourage conversation
with casual acquaintances The latest arrival had caught his attention
because there was something familiar about him It seemed to Graves that
he must have seen him before and yet that was very improbable This
was the attorneys first visit to Cape Cod and he had already vowed
devoutly that it should be his last He turned a chilling shoulder to
the trio opposite and again consulted the timetable Denboro was the
next station thenthank the LordSouth Denboro his destination

Conversation across the aisle was brisk and its subjects were many and
varied Mr Graves became aware more or less against his will that
the person called Capn was if not a leader in politics and local
affairs still one whose opinions counted Some of those opinions as
given were pointed and dryly descriptive as for instance when a
certain townmeeting candidate was compared to a sculpinwith a big
head that sort of impresses you till you get close enough to realize it
_has_ to be big to make room for so much mouth Graves who was fond
of salt water fishing knew what a sculpin was and appreciated the
comparison

The conductor entered the car and stopped to collect a ticket from his
new passenger It was evident that he too was acquainted with the
latter

Evening Capn he said politely Trains a little late tonight

It isfor tonights train was the prompt response but if it keeps
on at the rate its travelin now itll be a little early for tomorrow
mornins wont it

The conductor laughed Guess youre right he said This is about as
wet a storm as Ive run through since Ive been on the road If we get
to Provincetown without a washout well be lucky Well weve made
another hitch So far so good

The brakeman swung open the door to shout Denboro Denboro the
conductor picked up his lantern and hurried away the locomotive
whistled hoarsely and the train hiccoughed alongside another little
station Mr Graves peering through his window imagined that here
the silhouettes on the platform moved more briskly They seemed almost
excited He inferred that Denboro was a bigger and more wideawake
village than Ostable

But he was mistaken The reason for the excitement was made plain by the
conductor a moment afterwards That official entered the car removed
his uniform cap and rubbed a wet forehead with a wetter hand

Well gentlemen he said Ive been expecting it and here it is
Mark me down as a good prophet will you Theres a washout a mile
further on and a telegraph pole across the track Its blowing great
guns and raining pitchforks Itll be out of the question for us to go
forward before daylight if then Darn a railroad mans job anyhow

Five minutes later Mr Graves descended the steps of the car his
traveling bag in one hand and an umbrella in the other As soon as
both feet were securely planted on the platform he put down the bag
to wrestle with the umbrella and the hurricane which was apparently
blowing from four directions at once Feeling his hat leaving his head
he became aware that the umbrella had turned inside out He threw the
wreck violently under the train and stooped to pick up the bag The bag
was no longer there

Its all right said a calm voice behind him Ive got your satchel
neighbor Better beat for harbor hadnt we Here this way

The bewildered New Yorker felt his arm seized in a firm grip and he was
rushed across the platform through a deluge of winddriven water and
into a small hot closesmelling waiting room When he pushed his hat
clear of his eyes he saw that his rescuer was the big man who boarded
the train at Ostable He was holding the missing bag and smiling

Dirty weather hey he observed pleasantly Sorry your umbrella had
to go by the board I see you was carryin too much canvas and tried to
run alongside in time to give you a tow but you was dismasted just as I
got there Heres your dunnage all safe and sound

He extended the traveling bag at arms length Mr Graves accepted his
property and murmured thanks not too cordially His dignity and temper
had gone overboard with the umbrella and he had not yet recovered them

Well went on his companion here we are And I for one wanted to
be somewheres else Caleb turning to the station master who came in
at that moment any way of my gettin home tonight

Fraid not Capn was the answer I dont know of any Guess youll
have to put up at the hotel and wait till mornin

Thats right agreed the passenger called Dan who was standing
near Thats what Jerry and I are goin to do

Yes but you and Jerry are bound for Orham Im booked for South
Denboro and thats only seven miles off Id _swim_ the whole seven
rather than put up at Sim Titcombs hotel Ive been there afore thank
you Look here Caleb cant I hire a team and drive over

Well I dont know Spose you might ring up Pete Shattuck and ask him
Hes pretty particular about his horses though and I callate he

All right Ill ring him up Pete ought to get over some of his
particularness to oblige me Ive helped _him_ once or twice

He was on his way to the ticket office where the telephone hung on the
wall But Mr Graves stepped forward and spoke to him

Excuse me sir said the lawyer Did I understand you to say you were
going to South Denboro

Yes I am if the powersand Pete Shattuckll let me

You were going to drive over May I go with you Im very anxious to
get to South Denboro tonight I have some very important business
there and I want to complete it and get away tomorrow I must be back
in New York by the morning following

The captain looked his questioner over There was a doubtful look on his
face and he smiled quizzically

Well I dont know Mr

Graves is my name

I dont know Mr Graves This aint goin to be a pleasure cruise
exactly You might get pretty wet

I dont care I can get dry again when I get there Of course I shall
share the expense of the livery I shall be greatly obliged if I may go
with you If not I must try for a rig myself

Oh if you feel that way about it why come ahead and welcome I was
only warnin you thats all However with me aboard for ballast I
guess we wont blow away Wait a jiffy till I get after Pete

He entered the ticket office and raised a big hand to the little crank
of the telephone bell

Lets see Caleb he called whats Shattucks number

Four long and two short answered the station master

Graves wondering vaguely what sort of telephone system was in use on
Cape Cod heard his prospective pilot ring the instrument for a full two
seconds repeating the ring four times altogether This he followed with
two sharp tinkles Then came a series of shouted Hellos and at last
fragments of onehalf of a dialogue

That you Shattuck Know who this is dont you Yes thats right
Say how many folks listen every time a bell rings on this line Ive
heard no lessn eight receivers come down so far Two of em went up
then did you hear em Sartin I want to hire a team to go over
home with TonightSartin I dont care Yes you will
too _Yes_ you _will_ Send my man back with it tomorrow I
dont care _what_ it is so its got four legs and wheels

And so on for at least five minutes Then the captain hung up the
receiver and came back to the waiting room

Bargains made Mr Graves he announced Petell have some sort of
a turnout alongside soons he can get it harnessed If youve got any
extra storm duds in that satchel of yours Id advise you to put em on
Were goin to have a rough passage

Just how rough it was likely to be Graves realized when he emerged from
the station to board the Shattuck buggy Pete himself had driven the
equipage over from the livery stable

I wouldnt do this for anybody but you Capn he vouchsafed in what
might be called a reproachful shout Shouting was necessary owing to
the noise of the storm

Wouldnt do what replied the captain looking first at the ancient
horse and then at the battered buggy

Let this horse out a night like this

Humph I should think night would be the only time you would let him
out There there never mind Get aboard Mr Graves Put your
satchel on the floor between your feet Here let me hist that boot for
you

The boot was a rubber curtain buttoned across the front of the buggy
extending from the dashboard to just below the level of the drivers
eyes The lawyer clambered in behind it the captain followed the end
of the reins was passed through a slit in the boot Mr Shattuck after
inquiring if they were all taut gave the command Giddap and
horse and buggy moved around the corner of the station out into
darkness

Of the next hour Gravess memories are keen but monotonousa strong
smell of stable arising from the laprobe which had evidently been
recently used as a horse blanket the sound of hoofs in an interminable
jog jogsplash splash never hurrying a series of exasperated
howls from the captain who was doing his best to make them hurry the
thunderous roar of rain on the buggy top and the shrieking gale which
rocked the vehicle on its springs and sent showers of fine spray driving
in at every crack and crevice between the curtains

The view ahead over the boot was blackness bordered by spidery trees
and branches whipping in the wind Occasionally they passed houses
sitting well back from the road a lighted window gleaming cozily And
ever as they moved the storm seemed to gather force

Graves noticed this and at length when his nervousness had reached
the breaking point screamed a question in his companions ear They
had attempted no conversation during the ride the lawyer whose
contemptuous opinion of the locality and all its inhabitants was now a
conviction feeling that the result would not be worth the effort and
the captain busy with his driving

It is blowing worse than ever isnt it yelled the nervous Graves

Hey No just about the same Its dead souwest and were getting out
of the woods thats all Up on those bare hills we catch the full force
of it right off the Sound Be there pretty soon now if this Old Hundred
of a horse would quit walkin in his sleep and really move Them lights
ahead are South Denboro

The lights were clustered at the foot of a long and rather steep hill
Down the declivity bounced and rocked the buggy The horses hoofs
sounded hollow on the planks of a bridge The road narrowed and became
a village street bordered and arched by tall trees which groaned and
threshed in the hurricane The rain as it beat in over the boot had
so the lawyer fancied a salty taste

The captain bent down Say Mister he shouted where was it you
wanted to stop Who is it youre lookin for

What

I sayHeavens to Betsy how that wind does screechI say wherebouts
shall I land you This is South Denboro Whose house do you want to go
to

Im looking for one of your leading citizens Elisha Warren is his
name

What

Elisha Warren I

He was interrupted There was a sharp crack overhead followed by a
tremendous rattle and crash Then down upon the buggy descended what
to Graves appeared to be an avalanche of scratching tearing twigs
and branches They ripped away the boot and laprobe and jammed him back
against the seat their sharp points against his breast The buggy was
jerked forward a few feet and stopped short

He heard the clatter of hoofs and shouts of Whoa and Stand
still He tried to rise but the tangle of twigs before him seemed
impenetrable so he gave it up and remained where he was Then after an
interval came a hail from the darkness

Hi there Mr Graves ahoy Hurt be you

No the lawyers tone was doubtful Noo II guess not That you
Captain

Yes its me Stand still you foolhead Quit your hoppin up and
down These commands were evidently addressed to the horse Glad you
aint hurt Better get out hadnt you

IIm not sure that I can get out What on earth has happened

Tree limb carried away Lucky for us we got the brush end stead of
the butt Scooch down and see if you cant wriggle out underneath I
did

Mr Graves obediently scooched After a struggle he managed to slide
under the tangle of branches and at length stood on his feet in the
road beside the buggy The great limb had fallen across the street its
heavy end near the walk As the captain had said it was fortunate for
the travelers that the brush only had struck the carriage

Graves found his companion standing at the horses head holding the
frightened animal by the bridle The rain was descending in a flood

Well gasped the agitated New Yorker Ill be hanged if this isnt

Aint it But say Mr Graves _who_ did you say you was comin to
see

Oh a person named Elisha Warren He lives in this forsaken hole
somewhere I believe If I had known what an experience I must go
through to reach him Id have seen him at the devil

From the bulky figure at the horses head came a chuckle

Humph Well Mr Graves if the butt of that limb had fetched us
instead of tother end I dont know but you _might_ have seen him
there Im Elisha Warren and thats my house over yonder where the
lights are




CHAPTER II


This is your room Mr Graves said Miss Abigail Baker placing
the lighted lamp on the bureau And heres a pair of socks and some
slippers They belong to ElishaCapn Warren that isbut hes got
more Cold water and towels and soap are on the washstand over yonder
but I guess youve had enough _cold_ water for one night Theres plenty
hot in the bathroom at the end of the hall After you change your wet
things just leave em spread out on the floor Ill come fetch em by
and by and hang em to dry in the kitchen Come right downstairs when
youre ready Anything else you want No All right then You neednt
hurry Suppers waited an hour n a half as tis Twont hurt it to
wait a spell longer

She went away closing the door after her The bewildered wet and
shivering New Yorker stared about the room which to his surprise was
warm and cozy The warmth was furnished so he presently discovered
by a steam radiator in the corner Radiators and a bathroom These were
modern luxuries he would have taken for granted had Elisha Warren been
the sort of man he expected to find the country magnate the leading
citizen fitting brother to the late A Rodgers Warren of Fifth Avenue
and Wall Street

But the Captain Warren who had driven him to South Denboro in the rain
was not that kind of man at all His manner and his language were as far
removed from those of the late A Rodgers as the latters brown stone
residence was from this big rambling house with its deep stairs and
narrow halls its antiquated pictures and hideous oldfashioned wall
paper as far removed as Miss Baker whom the captain had hurriedly
introduced as my second cousin keepin house for me was from the
dignified butler at the mansion on Fifth Avenue Patchwork comforters
and feather beds were not in the lawyers scheme of things fit
associates for radiators and uptodate bathrooms And certainly this
particular Warren was not fitted to be elder brother to the New York
broker who had been Sylvester Kuhn and Graves client

It could not be it _could_ not There must be some mistake In country
towns there were likely to be several of the same name There must be
another Elisha Warren Comforted by this thought Mr Graves opened his
valise extracted therefrom other and drier articles of wearing apparel
and proceeded to change his clothes

Meanwhile Miss Abigail had descended the stairs to the sitting room
Before a driftwood fire in a big brick fireplace sat Captain Warren in
his shirtsleeves a pair of mammoth carpet slippers on his feet and
the said feet stretched luxuriously out toward the blaze

Abbie observed the captain this is solid comfort Every time I go
away from home I get into trouble dont I Last trip I took to Boston
I lost thirty dollars and

Lost it interrupted Miss Baker tartly Gave it away you mean

I didnt _give_ it away I lent it Abbie you ought to know the
difference between a gift and a loan

I dowhen there is any difference But if lendin Tim Foster aint
givin it away then I miss my guess

Well with another chuckle Tim dont feel that way He swore right
up and down that he wouldnt take a centas a gift I offered to make
him a present of ten dollars but he looked so shocked that I apologized
afore he could say no

Yes and then _lent_ him that thirty Shocked The only thing that
would shock that goodfornothin is bein set to work What possessed
you to be such a softhead _I_ dont know When you get back a copper
of that money Ill believe the millenniums struck thats all

Hum Well Ill help you believe itthat is if I have time afore I
drop dead of heart disease Abbie youd make a good lawyer you can get
up an argument out of a perfect agreement I said the thirty dollars
was lost to begin with But I knew Tim Fosters mother when she used
to think that boy of hers was the eighth wonder of the world And I
promised her Id do what I could for him longs I lived But it seems
to me weve drifted some off the course aint we What I started to say
was that every time I go away from home I get into trouble Up to Boston
twas Tim and his loan Tonight its about as healthy a souwester
as Ive ever been out in Dan fetched in the team has he

Yes Its in the stable He says the buggy dash is pretty well
scratched up and that its a wonder you and that Graves man want
killed Who is he anyhow

Land knows I dont

You dont know Then whats he doin here

Changin his duds I guess Thats what Id do if I looked as much like
a drowned rat as he did

Lisha Warren if you aint the most _provoking_ thing Dont be so
unlikely You know what I mean Whats he come here to this house
for

Dont know Abbie I didnt know he _was_ comin here till just as we
got down yonder by Emerys corner I asked him who he was lookin for
he said Elisha Warren and then the tree caved in on us

Lisha youyou dont spose twas a_sign_ do you

Sign

Yes a sign a prophecylike a warnin that somethin is goin to
happen

The captain put back his head and laughed

Sign somethin _had_ happened I should think he answered Whats
_goin_ to happen is that Pete Shattuckll get his buggy painted
freefornothin at my expense Hows supper gettin along Is it
ready

Ready Its been ready for so long that itll have to be got ready
all over again if Oh Come right in Mr Graves I hope youre drier
now

Captain Warren sprang from the chair to greet his visitor who was
standing in the doorway

Yes come right in Mr Graves he urged cordially Set down by the
fire and make yourself comftable Abbiell have somethin for us to eat
in a jiffy Pull up a chair

The lawyer came forward hesitatingly The doubts which had troubled him
ever since he entered the house were still in his mind

Thank you Captain he said But before I accept more of your
hospitality I feel I should be sure there is no mistake I have come on
important business and

Hold on The captain held up a big hand Dont you say another word
he commanded Theres just one business that interests me this minute
and thats supper Theres no mistake about _that_ anyhow Did you say
Come ahead Abbie or was you just going to Good Right into the
dinin room Mr Graves

The dining room was long and low The woodwork was white the floor
green painted boards with braided rag mats scattered over them
There were oldfashioned pictures on the walls pictures which brought
shudders to the artistic soul of Atwood Graves A broad bay window
filled one side of the apartment and in this window on shelves and in
wire baskets were Miss Bakers cherished and carefully tended plants
As for the dining table it was dark oldfashioned walnut as were the
chairs

Set right down here Mr Graves ordered the captain Ill try
to keep you supplied with solid cargo and Abbiell tend to the
moistenin Hope that teapot is full up Abbie Hot tea tastes good
after youve swallered as much cold rain as Mr Graves and I have
FatherwethanktheeforthesemerciessetbeforeusAmen Hows
your appetite when it comes to clam pie Mr Graves

Mr Gravess appetite was good and the clam pie was good So too
were the hot biscuits and the tea and homemade preserves and cake
Conversation during the meal was for the most part a monologue by the
captain He gave Miss Baker a detailed and exaggerated account of his
adventures in Ostable on board the train and during the drive home
The housekeeper listened fidgeting in her chair

Lisha Warren she interrupted how you do talk Rainin so hard you
had to hold the reins taut to keep the horses head out of water so he
wouldnt drown The idea

Fact asserted Captain Warren with a wink at his guest And that
want the worst of it Twas so dark I had to keep feelin the buggy
with my foot to be sure I was in it Aint that so Mr Graves Here
Abbie wont like to have you set lookin at that empty plate Shes
always afraid folksll notice the gilts wearin off Pass it over
quick and let me cover it with some more pie

Yes and have some more tea urged Miss Abbie You mustnt pay
attention to what he says Mr Graves she went on Some day hell
tell the truth by accident and then Ill know its time to send for the
doctor

Several times the lawyer attempted to mention the business which had
brought him to the Cape and the probability of his having made a
mistake But neither host nor housekeeper would listen

When youve been in South Denboro as long as I have declared the
former youll understand that the time to talk business is when you
cant think of anything else Wait till we get into the settin room
Abbie those six or eight biscuits Ive ate are gettin lonesome Ill
take another for sociability thank you

But at last when all the biscuits but one were gone and the cake
plate looked like the Desert of Sahara the captain pushed back his
chair rose and led the way into the next room Miss Baker remained to
clear the table

Set down by the fire Mr Graves urged the captain Nothin like
burnin wood to look hot and comftable is there It dont always make
you feel that waythats why I put in hot water heatbut for looks and
sociableness you cant beat a log fire Smoke do you

Yes Occasionally But Captain Warren

Here try that Its a cigar the Judge gave me over to Ostable He
smokes that kind reglar but if you dont like it throw it away
He aint here to see you do it so you wont be fined for contempt of
court Ill stick to a pipe if you dont mind Now were shipshape
and all taut I callate Lets see you wanted to talk business I
believe

Yes I did But before I begin I should like to be sure you are the
Elisha Warren I came from New York to interview Is there another of
that name in Denboro

Umhm Theres Warrens aplenty all through this section of the Cape
Our family blew ashore here a hundred and fifty years ago or such
matter My dads name was Elisha so was my grandfathers Both sea
capns and both dead Theres another Elisha livin over on the shore
lane

Indeed Then perhaps it is he I want

Praps Hes keeper of the town poorhouse I can tell you better if you
give me an idea what your business is

I am an attorney And now let me ask another question please Have
youhad you a brother in business in New York

Hey The captain turned and looked his guest squarely in the eye His
brows drew together

Ive got a brother in New York he answered slowly Did _he_ send
you here

Was your brothers name A Rodgers Warren

A Rodgers No His name is Abijah Warren andWait His middle name
is Rodgers though Did Bije send you to me

A moment Captain Was your brother a broker

Yes His office isor used to be on Broad Street What

You have not heard from him for some time

Not for eighteen years He and I didnt agree as well as we might
Maybe twas my fault maybe twas his I have my own ideas on that If
youre lookin for Bije Warrens brother Mr Graves I guess youve
come to the right place But _what_ he sent you to me for or what
he wantsfor he wants somethin or he wouldnt have sentI dont
understand

Why do you think he wanted something

Because hes Bije Warren and I was brought up with him When we was
young ones together he went to school and I went to work He got the
frostin on the cake and I got the burnt part next to the pan He went
to college and I went to sea He However you mustnt think I find
fault with him for that I spiled him as much as anybody I guess
Twas later on that we Well never mind that either What is it he
wants of me after eighteen years

He wants a good deal of you Captain Warren Or _did_ want it

Did Dont he want it now

I dont know Captain Im surprised that you havent heard It seems
that I am the bearer of bad news Your brother

Is Bije _dead_

He died ten days ago very suddenly In a way it was a great shock to us
all yet we have known that his heart was weak He realized it too

So Bije is dead hey Captain Elishas face was very grave and he
spoke slowly Dead Well well well

He paused and looked into the fire Graves saw again that vague
resemblance he had caught on the train but had forgotten He knew now
why he noticed it Unlike as the two brothers were unlike in almost
every way the trace of family likeness was there This sunburned
retired captain _was_ the New York financiers elder brother And this
certainty made Mr Gravess errand more difficult and the cause of it
more inexplicable

Captain Elisha cleared his throat

Well well he sighed So Bije has gone I spose you think its
odd maybe he went on that I aint more struck down by the news In
a way I am and in a way Im mighty sorry too But to speak truth
he and I have been so apart and have had nothin to do with each other
for so long thatthat well Ive come to feel as if I didnt have a
brother And I know he felt that way Yes and _wanted_ to feel soI
know that

I wouldnt say that if I were you observed the lawyer gently I
think youre mistaken there

I aint mistaken Why look here Mr Graves There was a time when
Id have got down on my knees and crawled from here to New York to help
Bije Warren I lent him money to start in business Later on him and I
went into partnership together on aa fool South American speculation
that didnt pan out for nothin I didnt care for that I took my
chance same as he did we formed a stock company all amongst ourselves
and Ive got my share of the stock somewhere yet It may come in handy
if I ever want to paper the barn But twant business deals of that
kind that parted us twas another matter Somethin that he did to
other folks whod trusted us and Humph this dont interest you of
course Well Bije was well off I know His wife died way back
in the nineties She was one of them fashionable women and a hayseed
saltherrin of a bachelor brotherinlaw stuck down here in the
sandheaps didnt interest her muchexcept as somethin to forget I
spose I used to see her name in the Boston papers occasionally givin
parties at Newport and one thing another I never envied em that kind
of life Im as well fixed as I want to be Got some money put by for
a rainy spell comftable house and land best town on earth to live in
and work for Im satisfied and always have been I wouldnt change for
nothin But Im nine year older than Bije wasand yet Im left alive
Hum

Your brother had two children by his marriage said Graves after a
moment of silence

Hey Two children Why yes I remember he did Boy and girl want
they I never saw em Theyve growed up by this time of course

Yes the eldest Caroline is nearly twenty The boy Stephen is a
year younger It is concerning those children Captain Warren that I
have come to you

Captain Elisha turned in his chair Hey he queried The children
Youve come to me about Bijes children

Graves nodded Yes he answered solemnly That is what I meant by
saying your brother had not forgotten you or wished to forget you In
spite of the estrangement it is evident that his confidence in your
judgment and integrity was supreme His children were his idols Captain
Warren and he has left them in your charge

The captains pipe fell to the hearth

_What_ he shouted Left his children toto _me_ Mr Graves
youreyoure out of your heador I am

No Im perfectly sane I have a copy of the will here and

He was interrupted by Miss Baker who appeared at the door of the dining
room Did you want me Lisha she asked

Her employer stared at her in a dazed uncomprehending way

Want you he repeated Want you

Yes I heard you holler and I thought praps you was callin me

Hey No I dont want you Abbie Holler I shouldnt wonder If
all I did was holler Im surprised at myself No no Run along out and
shut the door Yes shut it Now Mr Graves say that over again and
say it slow

I say that your brother has left his two children in your care until
the youngest shall become of agetwentyone I have a copy of his will
here and

Wait wait let me think Left his children to me to _me_ Mr
Graves had Bije lost all his money

No He was not the millionaire that many thought him Miss Warren and
her brother will be obliged to economize somewhat in their manner
of living But with care _and_ economy their income should be quite
sufficient without touching the principal to

Hold on again the income you say What is that income

Roughly speaking a mere estimate about twenty to twentyfive thousand
yearly

Captain Elisha had stooped to pick up the pipe he had dropped His
fingers touched it but they did not close Instead he straightened up
in his chair as if suffering from an electric shock

Mr Graves he began Mr Graves are you cra No I asked you that
before Butbut twenty _thousand_ aa year For mercy sakes whats
the principal

In the neighborhood of five hundred thousand I believe Of course we
had no authority to investigate thoroughly That will be a part of your
duties but

Sshh Let me soak this into my brains a little at a time Bije leaves
his children five hundred thousand half a million andand theyve got
to _economize_ And Im Would you mind readin me that will

The attorney drew a long envelope from his pocket extracted therefrom a
folded document donned a pair of goldmounted eyeglasses and began to
read aloud

The will was short and very concise I Abijah Rodgers Warren being
of sound mind

Youre sartin that parts true are you broke in the captain

Graves nodded rather impatiently and continued Of sound mind
memory and understanding do make publish and declare this to be my
last will and testament in manner following that is to say

FirstI direct my executor hereinafter named to pay my just debts
and funeral expenses as soon as maybe convenient after my decease

Did he owe much think likely asked Captain Elisha

Apparently not Very little beyond the usual bills of a household

Yes yes Grocer and butcher and baker and suchlike Well I guess they
wont have to put in a keeper Heave ahead

SecondI give devise and bequeath all my estate both real and
personal to my brother Elisha Warren if he survive

The captain gasped To me he cried in utter amazement He leaves
it to _me_ Bije leavessay Mr Graves theres some mistake here
somewhere sure And besides you said

Just a minute Captain Warren if you please If youll be patient and
not interrupt Ill try to make the whole matter plain

Well if you can do _that_ youll have King Solomon and all his wisdom
beat a mile thats all Ive got to say Go on

To my brother Elisha Warren if he survive me _in trust_
nevertheless for the following purpose to wit

To invest the same and to use the income thereof for the education and
maintenance of my two children Caroline Edgecombe Warren

Edgecombe Named for some of his wifes folks I presume likely Excuse
me for puttin my oar in again Go on

And Stephen Cole Warren

_Thats_ his wife sartin She was a Cole I swan I beg your pardon

Until the elder Caroline Edgecombe Warren shall have reached her
twentyfirst birthday when onehalf of the principal of said estate
together with onehalf of the accumulated interest shall be given to
her and the trust continued for the education and maintenance of my
son Stephen Cole Warren until he shall have reached his twentyfirst
birthday when I direct that the remainder be given to him

ThirdI appoint as testamentary guardian of my said children my said
brother Elisha Warren

FourthI appoint as sole executor of this my last will and
testament my said brother Elisha Warren

FifthImposing implicit trust and confidence in Elisha Warren
my brother I direct that he be not required to give bond for the
performance of any of the affairs or trusts to which he has been herein
appointed

The remainder concluded Graves refolding the will is purely
formal It is dated May 15th three years ago Your brother Captain
Warren evidently realized although no one else seems to have done
so the precarious state of his health and prepared as every careful
person should for the great emergency

The attorney removed his eyeglasses and rubbed them with his
handkerchief Captain Elisha sat silent staring at the fire After an
interval Graves spoke again

Of course Captain he went on my errand is now plain I come to
acquaint you with your brothers last wishes and to ascertain whether or
not you are willing to accept the trust and responsibility he has laid
upon you As you doubtless know the state provides a legal rate of
reimbursement for such services as yours willor maybe Ahem

May be You mean I aint got to do this thing unless I want to

Certainly You have the right to renounce the various appointments in
which case another executor trustee and guardian will be appointed
I realize and Im sure that your brothers children will realize your
hesitance in assuming such a responsibility over persons whom you have
never even met

Yes I guess well all realize it you neednt worry about that Look
here do the children know Im elected

Yes Of course the will has been read to them

Hum I spose likely they was overcome with joy want they

Graves bit his lip Remembering the comments of Miss Caroline and
her brother when they learned of their uncles appointment he had
difficulty in repressing a smile

Well he replied slowly of course one could scarcely expect them
to rejoice They have never seen you In fact I doubt if either of them
knew their father had a brother living

Yees That part dont surprise me But the rest of it does By the
miracles of the prophets the rest of it does That BijeBijeshould
leave his children and their money to _me_ to take care of is passin
human belief as our old minister used to say Humph I spose
likely Mr Graves youd like to have me say yes or no to the thing
while youre here hey

Graves nodded It would be well to do so he said The settlement
of the estate must be taken in hand as soon as possible The law so
directs

Yes I see that Well what would you advise my doin

To this direct question the lawyer returned a noncommittal answer

Im afraid that must be answered by yourself alone Captain Warren he
said Of course the acceptance of the trust will necessarily involve
much trouble and inconvenience especially to one of yourersettled
anderconservativeI judge merely from what you have saidyour
conservative habits The estate is large the investments are
doubtless many and varied and the labor of looking into and
investigating them may require some technical skill and knowledge of
finance Yes

Umhm Well I judge that that kind of skill and knowledge could be
hired if a feller felt like payin fair wages hey

Oh yes yes Any good lawyer could attend to that under the
supervision of the executor certainly But there are other
inconveniences to aa

Country jay like me I understand Go ahead

I mean that you would probably be required to spend much or all of
the next two or three years in New York

Would hey I didnt know but bein as a guardian has entire charge of
the children and their money and allI understand thats what he does
havehe could direct the children fetched down to where _he_ lived if
he wanted to Am I wrong

No the lawyers hesitancy and annoyance was plainly evident Noo
Of course that _might_ be done Still I

You think that wouldnt cause no more rejoicin than some other things
have Yes yes I callate I understand Mr Graves Well I guess
youll have to give me tonight to chew over this I guess you will
Its come on me so sudden Bijes death and all that I want to be by
myself and think I dont want to seem unsociable or lackin in
hospitality The whole house is yours Help yourself to it But when Im
caught in a clove hitch I just have to set down and think myself out of
it I _have_ to I was built and launched that way I guess and maybe
youll excuse me

Certainly Captain Warren Youre quite right in wishing to deliberate
on so important a matter And if you will excuse me in return I
believe I will go to my room Ive had a rather wearing day

And a damp evenin Yes Ill excuse and sympathize with you too Ill
see you to your room and Ill hope youll have considerble more sleep
than Im likely to get Abbie Abbie Fetch Mr Gravess lamp
wont you please

It was after two the next morning before Captain Elisha rose from his
chair by the fire and entered his bed chamber Yet when Atwood Graves
came down to breakfast he found his host in the sitting room awaiting
him

Afore we tackle Abbies pancakes and fishballs Mr Graves said the
captain lets get the rest of that will business off our minds Then
we can have the pancakes to take the taste out of our mouths as you
might say And let me ask you one more question ThisererCaroline
and Stephen theyre used to livin pretty wellfashionable society
and the like of that hey

Yes Their home was on Fifth Avenue and the family moved in the best
circles

Hum I should imagine life on twentyodd thousand a year must be
pretty much all circles one everlastin turn your partners Well Mr
Graves my circles down here are considerble smaller but they suit me
Im worth twentyodd thousand myself not in a year but in a lifetime
Im selectman and director in the bank and trustee of the church When I
holler Boo the South Denboro folkssome of them anyhowset up and
take notice I can lead the grand march down in this neighborhood once
in a while and I callate Im prettier leadin it than I would be doin
a solitaire jig for two years on the outside edge of New Yorks best
circles And Im mighty sure Im more welcome Now my eyesights strong
enough to see through a twofoot hole after the plugs out and I can
see that you and Bijes children wont shed tears if I say no to that
will No offense meant you know just common sense thats all

This was plain speaking Mr Graves colored though he didnt mean to
and for once could not answer offhand

So continued the captain Ill ease your and their minds by sayin
that the way I feel now I probably shant accept the trust I
_probably_ shant But I wont say sure I wont becausewell because
Bije was my brother he was that no matter what our diffrences may
have been And I knowI _know_ that there must be some reason bigger
than implicit trust and the other Maybaskets for his appointin me in
his will What that reason is I _dont_ knowyet

Then you intend

I dont know what I intendin the end But for a beginnin I callate
to run down to New York some time durin the next week take a cruise
round and sort of look things over




CHAPTER III


Its a box of a place though isnt it declared Mr Stephen Warren
contemptuously glancing about the library of the apartment A box by
George I think its a blooming shame that we have to put up with it
Sis

Mr Warren sprawled in the most comfortable chair in the room was
looking out through the window across the windswept width of Central
Park West over the knolls and valleys of the Park itself now bare of
foliage and sprinkled with patches of snow There was a discontented
look on his face and his hands were jammed deep in his trousers
pockets

His sister Caroline sat opposite to him also looking out at the
December landscape She too was discontented and unhappy though she
tried not to show it

Why dont you say something snapped Stephen after a moment of
silence _Isnt_ it a box of a place Now come

Yes replied the young lady without looking at her brother Yes
Steve I suppose it is But you must remember that we must make the
best of it I always wondered how people could live in apartments Now I
suppose I shall have to find out

Well I maintain that we dont have to We arent paupers even though
father wasnt so well fixed as everyone thought With management and
care we could have stayed in the old house I believe and kept up
appearances at least Whats the use of advertising that were broke

But Steve you know Mr Graves said

Oh yes I know You swallowed every word Graves said Caro as if
he was the whole book of Proverbs By George _I_ dont Im from
Missouri

Mr Warren being in the Sophomore class at Yale was of the age when
one is constitutionally from Missouri Probably King Solomon at
sixty had doubts concerning the scope and depth of his wisdom at
eighteen he would have admitted its allembracing infallibility without
a blush

I tell you continued Stephen theres no sense in it Sis You and I
know plenty of people whose incomes are no larger than ours Do they
economize as Graves is continually preaching They do not publicly
at least They may save a bit here and there but they do it where it
doesnt show and nobody knows Take the Blaisdells for instance When
the Sodality Bank went up and old Blaisdell died everybody said the
family was down and out They must have lost millions But did _they_
move into apartments and put up a placard Home of the DeadBrokes
Walk in and Sympathize I guess they didnt They went into mourning
of course and that let them out of entertaining and all that but they
stayed where they were and kept up the bluff Thats the thing that
counts in this worldkeeping up the bluff

Yes but everyone knows they arebluffing as you call it

What of it They dont really know they only suspect And I met Jim
Blaisdell yesterday and he shook my hand after I had held it in front
of his eyes where he couldnt help seeing it and had the nerve to tell
me he hoped things werent as bad with us as he had heard

I never liked the Blaisdells declared Caroline indignantly

Neither did I Neither do most people But Jim is just as much in the
swim as he ever was and hes got his governors place on the board of
directors at the bank now that its reorganized and an office down
town and hes hand and glove with Von Blarcom and all the rest
They think hes a promising plucky young man Theyll help his bluff
through And are his mother and sister dropped by the people in their
set I havent noticed it

Well Mrs Corcoran Dunn told me that everyone was talking about
the Blaisdells and wondering how long they could keep it up And the
newspapers have been printing all sorts of things and hinting that
young Mr Blaisdells appointment as director after his father wrecked
the bank was a scandal At least we havent _that_ to bear up under
Father was honest if he wasnt rich

Who cares for the newspapers Theyre all run by demagogues hunting
sensations What makes me feel the worst about all this is that Stock
Exchange seat of fathers If I were only of age so that I could go
down there on the floor I tell you it wouldnt be long before you and I
were back where we belong Sis But no Im a kid so Graves thinks in
charge of a guardiana _guardian_ by gad

He snorted in manly indignation Caroline her pretty face troubled
rose and walked slowly across the room It was a large room in spite of
the fact that it was one of a suite in an apartment hotel and furnished
richly A Rodgers Warren spent his money with taste and spent it
freely while he lived The furniture the paintings and bricabrac
were of the very best chosen with care here and abroad

Oh dear sighed the girl I do hope Mr Graves will be well enough
to call today He expected to Except for the telephone message telling
us that that _man_ at Denboro

Our dear Uncle Elisha put in Stephen with sarcasm Uncle Lish
Heavens what a name

Hush He cant help his name And fathers was worse yetAbijah Think
of it

I dont want to think of it Neither did the governor thats why
he dropped it I suppose Just what did Graves say Give me his exact
words

His partner Mr Kuhn telephoned He said that Mr Graves had a bad
cold having been wet through in a dreadful storm down there in the
country The doctor forbade his leaving the house for a day or two but
he would call on Tuesdaytodayif he was sufficiently recovered And
Mr Kuhn said that everything was satisfactory This Captain Warrena
ship captain I suppose he iswould in all probability refuse to
accept the guardianship and the rest of it

Refuse I should think so Im just as certain father was insane when
he made that will as I am that Im alive If I thought he wasnt Id
never forgive him

Hush Steve You promised me you wouldnt speak in that way

Well all right I wont But Caro he _must_ have been insane If he
wasnt do you suppose he would have put us and the estate in the care
of a DownEast jay Its inconceivable Its ridiculous Think of it
Suppose this uncle of ours had accepted Suppose he had come to town
here and any of our friends had met him This is our guardian Captain
Warren of Punkin Centre Please to meet ye says Uncle Lish Hows
taters Horrors Say Caro you havent told anyone Malcolm or his
mother or anyone have you

Of course not Steve You know I wouldnt

Well dont They neednt know it now or at any other time Graves
will probably get himself appointed and hes respectable if he is an
old fogy Well worry along till Im twentyone and thenwell then
Ill handle our business myself

Evidently there was no question in his mind as to his ability to handle
this or any business no matter how involved He rose from his chair and
yawned

Its deadly dull he complained You dont need me do you Caro I
believe Ill go out for a while That is unless you really care

His sister hesitated before replying When she spoke there was
disappointment in her tone

Why Steve she said I did hope you might be here when Mr Graves
came He will wish to speak of important matters and it seems to me
that both of us should hear what he has to say

Young Warren who had started for the door stopped and kicked
impatiently at the corners of the rug

Oh _well_ he observed if you want me of course Ill stay But why
doesnt old Graves come if he is coming Maybe hes under the weather
yet he added hopefully Perhaps he isnt coming at all today I
believe Ill call up Kuhn on the phone and find out

He was on his way to the telephone when the doorbell buzzed

Gad there he is now he exclaimed Now I suppose Ill have to stay
Well hear about dear Uncle Lish wont we Oh joy

But the staid butler when he entered the library did not announce the
lawyers name

Mrs Corcoran Dunn and Mr Malcolm he said Will you see them Miss
Caroline

The young ladys face lit up

Certainly Edwards she said Show themOh Mrs Dunn Im so glad
to see you It was _ever_ so good of you to come And Malcolm

Mrs M Corcoran Dunn was tall and in South Denboro would have been
called fleshy in spite of her own and the dressmakers efforts to
conceal the fact She was elaborately gowned and furred and something
about her creaked when she walked She rushed into the room at the
butlers heels and greeting Caroline with outstretched hands kissed
her effusively on the cheek

My dear child she cried how could I stay away We have spoken of
you and Stephen _so_ often this morning We know how lonely you must be
and Malcolm and I decided we _must_ run in on you after lunch Didnt
we Malcolm

Mr Malcolm Corcoran Dunn her son was a blond young man with a rather
indolent manner

Sure Mater he said calmly How dye do Caroline Lo Steve

The quartette shook hands Mrs Dunn sank creakingly into a chair and
gazed about the room Malcolm strolled to the window and looked out
Stephen followed and stood beside him

My dear said Mrs Dunn addressing Caroline how are you getting on
How are your nerves Is all the dreadful settling over

Very nearly thank goodness

Thats a mercy I should certainly have been here yesterday to help you
in superintending and arranging and so on but I was suffering from one
of my hearts and you know what _they_ are

Everyone who knew Mrs Corcoran Dunn was acquainted with her hearts
The attacks came so she was accustomed to explain from an impaired
valve and some dayshe usually completed the sentence with upturned
eyes and a resigned upward wave of the hand

Her son turned from the window

I say Mother he explained wearily I do wish you wouldnt speak of
your vital organs in the plural Anyone would imagine you were a sort
of freak like the twoheaded boy at the circus Its positively
distressing

Stephen laughed He admired young Dunn immensely Mrs Dunn sighed

Dont Malcolm dear she pleaded You sound so unfeeling One not
acquainted with your real kindness of heart

Oh drop it interrupted Malcolm Lets omit the heart interest
This isnt a clinic I say Steve how do you like the new flat It is a
flat isnt it

Stephen turned red His sister colored and bit her lip Mrs Dunn
hastened to the rescue

Horrors she exclaimed Malcolm you really are insufferable Flat
Caroline dear you mustnt mind him He will have his joke Malcolm
apologize

The command was sharp and her son obeyed it

Beg your pardon Steve he said Yours too Caroline I was only
joking Theres a little beast of a bookkeeper down at the office who
is forever talking of his nice flat in the Bronx Its a standing
guy you know So far as I can see these are pretty snug quarters And
attractively arranged too Your taste Caroline Im betting

Miss Warren slightly mollified bowed assent

I thought so continued Malcolm No one but you would have known
exactly the right spot for everything Show us through wont you

But Mrs Dunn had other plans

Not now Malcolm she put in Caroline is tired out Im sure A
little fresh air will do her good I was going to suggest that you and
she and Stephen go for a short ride Yes really you must my dear she
added turning to the girl beside her Our car is at the door its not
at all a bad afternoon and the outing will be just what you need

Thank you Mrs Dunn said Caroline gratefully I should like to
Indeed I should But we have been expecting a business call from Mr
Graves fathers lawyer and

Oh come on Sis interrupted Stephen Im dying to get out of this
jail Let old Graves wait if he comes We wont be long and besides
its not certain that he is coming today Come on

Im afraid I ought not Steve Mr Graves may come andand it seems
too bad to trouble our friends

Its not trouble its pleasure urged Mrs Dunn Malcolm will be
delighted It was his idea Wasnt it turning to her son

Oh yes certainly replied the young gentleman Hope youll come
Caroline And you of course Steve The blessed machines been off its
feed for a week or more but Peter says he thinks its all right again
Well give it a tryout on the Drive Hope we have better luck than my
last with a laugh They nabbed us for speeding and I had to promise
to be a good boy or to be fined Said we were hitting it at fifty an
hour We _were_ going some thats a fact Ha ha

But he wont be reckless when youre with him Caroline put in his
mother You will go Thats so nice As for Mr Graves Ill explain
if he comes Oh no _Im_ not going I shall remain here in this
comfortable chair and rest until you return Its exactly what my
physician orders and for once Im going to obey him My heart you
know my poor heart

She waved her hand and raised her eyes Miss Warren expostulated but to
no purpose Mrs Corcoran Dunn would _not_ go but the others must So
at last they did When Caroline and her brother had gone for their
wraps Mrs Dunn laid a hand on her sons arm

Now mind she whispered see if you can find out anything during the
ride Something more explicit about the size of their estate and who the
guardian is to be There are all sorts of stories you know and we
_must_ learn the truth very soon Dont appear curious but merely
friendly You understand

Sure Mater was the careless answer Ill pump

The two departed leaving their lady visitor ensconced in the
comfortable chair She remained in it for perhaps five minutes Then she
rose and sauntered about the room She drifted into the drawingroom
returning a moment later and sauntering casually toward the open desk by
the fireplace There were papers and letters scattered about this desk
and these she turned over glancing toward the door to be sure no one
was coming The letters were for the most part messages of sympathy
from friends of the Warren family Hearing an approaching step she
hastily returned to the chair

Edwards the butler entered the library and replenished the fire Mrs
Dunn languidly accosted him

AherEdwards she said you areergrowing familiar with your
new home

Yes maam replied Edwards politely

It must seemersmall compared to the other

Smaller yes maam

But very snug and comfortable

Yes ma am

It is fortunate that Miss Warren and her brother have the aid of such
aan old servant of the family

Thank you maam

Is Miss Caroline managing her own affairs

Apparently so Yes maam

I presume however a guardian has been appointed With an estate such
as the late Mr Warren _must_ have left some responsible person would
be of course necessary

She paused Edwards having arranged the logs to his liking brushed the
dust from his hands

I dont know maam Im sure he said Neither Miss Caroline nor Mr
Stephen have spoken with me concerning the family affairs

Mrs Corcoran Dunn straightened with hauteur

I think that was the doorbell she remarked a trifle sharply If it
should be Mr Graves the attorney you may show him into the library
here

Yes maam said Edwards once more and departed

The lady visitor heard voices in the passage She listened but could
hear nothing understandable Evidently the butler was having an argument
with someone It could not be Graves

Edwards reappeared looking troubled

Its aa gentleman to see Miss Caroline he said He wont give his
name maam but says shes expecting him

Expecting him

Yes maam I told him she was out but he said he was intending
to stay a while anyway and would wait I asked his business but he
wouldnt tell it

Thats odd Mrs Dunn was slightly interested A tradesman perhaps
or an agent of the landlord

Noo maam I dont think hes either of them maam

What sort of a person is he Edwards

The butlers face twitched for an instant with a troubled smile Then it
resumed its customary respectful calm

I hardly know maam Hes an oddish man HeI think hes from the
country

From behind him came a quiet chuckle

Youre right Commodore said a mans voice Im from the country
You guessed it

Edwards jumped startled out of his respectable wits Mrs Dunn rose
indignantly from her chair

I beg your pardon maam said the intruder appearing in the doorway
You mustnt think Im forcin my way where I aint wanted But it
seemed to take so long to make the Admiral here understand that I was
goin to wait until Caroline came back that I thought Id save time and
breath by provin it to him I didnt know there was any company Excuse
me maam I wont bother you Ill just come to anchor out here in the
entry Dont mind me

He bowed politely picked up the large suitcase plainly brannew
which he had momentarily placed on the rug at his feet and with it
in one hand and a big soft felt hat in the other stepped back into the
hall out of sight The astonished Mrs Dunn and the paralyzed Edwards
heard a chair crack as if a heavy weight had descended upon it
Evidently he had come to anchor

The lady was the first to recover the power of speech

Why she exclaimed in an alarmed whisper Why I never heard of
such brazen impertinence in my life He must be insane He is a lunatic
isnt he Edwards

The butler shook his head II dont know maam he stammered

I believe he is Mrs Dunns presence of mind was returning and with
it her courage Her florid cheeks flamed a more vivid red and her eyes
snapped But whether he is or not he shant bulldoze me

She strode majestically to the door The visitor was seated in the hall
calmly reading a newspaper Hat and suitcase were on the floor beside
him

What do you mean by this demanded the lady Who are you If you have
any business here state it at once

The man glanced at her over his spectacles rose and stood looking down
at her His expression was pleasant and he was remarkably cool

Yes maam he said gravely Ill be glad to tell you who I am
if youd like to have me Id have done it before but I thought there
werent any use troublin you with my affairs But just a minute
he hesitatedI havent made any mistake have I I understood your
stewardthe feller with the brass buttons to say that Abijah Warrens
children lived here Thats so aint it If not then I _am_ mistaken

Mrs Dunn regarded him with indignation You are she said coldly
The family of the late Mr Rodgers Warren lives here I presume the
slight resemblance in names misled you Edwards show the gentleman
out

Just one moment more maam It was Rodgers Warrens children I was
lookin for A Rodgers Warren he called himself didnt he Yes Well
the A stood for Abijah that was his Christian name And he left
two children Caroline and Stephen Good I thought for a jiffy Id
blundered in where I had no business but its all right You see
maam Im their uncle from South Denboro Massachusetts My name is
Elisha Warren

Mrs Dunn gasped Edwards peering over her shoulder breathed heavily

You aretheir _uncle_ repeated the lady

Yes maam Im Bijes brother Oh dont worry Its all right And
dont fret yourself about me either Ill set right down out here
and read my paper and wait till Caroline or Stephen get home Theyre
expectin me Mr Graves the lawyer told em I was comin

He calmly seated himself and adjusted his spectacles Mrs Dunn stared
at him then at Edwards After an instants indecision she stepped
back into the library and walked to the window She beckoned with an
agitated finger to the butler who joined her

Edwards she whispered did you hear what he said

Yes maam replied Edwards wideeyed and wondering

Is it true

I dont know maam

Did Mr Warren have a brother

I didnt know that he had maam

Do youdo you think it likely that he would have a brother likelike
_that_

I dont know maam

Was Miss Caroline expecting him

I dont know maam She

Oh you dont know anything Youre impossible Go away

Yes maam said Edwards thankfully and went Mrs Corcoran Dunn
stood for some minutes by the window thinking or trying to think a way
to the truth in this astounding development Of course the man _might_
be a lunatic who had gained his information concerning the Warren family
from the papers but he did not look like a lunatic On the other hand
he certainly did not look as one would have expected a brother of
Rodgers Warrens to look Oddest of all if he was such a brother why
had neither Caroline or Stephen mentioned his existence According to
his story Graves the Warren lawyer had warned the children of his
coming Caroline had been very reticent concerning her fathers will
the amount of his estate and the like And Mrs Dunn had repeatedly
though discreetly endeavored to find out these important details
Neither hints nor questions had resulted satisfactorily Was it possible
that this was the reason this country uncle If sowell if so here
was a Heavensent opportunity for a little genteel and perfectly safe
detective work Mrs Dunn creakingly crossed the room and spoke

Mr Warren she said I feel guilty in keeping you out there Wont
you come into the library

Why thank you maam Im all right Dont you trouble about me Go
right on with your readin or sewin or knittin or whatever you was
doin and

I was not reading replied Mrs Dunn with a slight shudder Come in
please I wish you to

Captain Elisha folded his paper and put it in his pocket Entering the
library he stood quietly waiting

Wont you sit down asked his impromptu hostess trying hard to be
gracious

Thank you said the captain He sank into an armchair and looked
curiously about him

So you are the late Mr Warrens brother asked the lady making her
first lead in the game

Yes maam His older brother Bije was ten year youngern I am
Mrser

Dunn I am an old friend of the family

Thats good Im glad to hear theyve got friends When youre in
sickness or trouble or sorrer friendship counts for considerble How
are the young folksCaroline and Stephenpretty smart hey

_Smart_ Why they are intelligent naturally I

No no I mean are they pretty well

Very well indeed considering the shock of their recent bereavement

Yes yes Of course And theyve moved too Movins an awful job They
say three movins are as bad as a fire but I callate Id rather burn
up a set of carpets than _pull_ em up specially if they was insured
Taint half so much strain on your religion I remember the last time
we took up our carpets at home Abbieshes my second cousin keepin
house for mesaid if gettin down on my knees has that effect on me
shed never ask me to go to prayermeetin again Ho ho

He chuckled Mrs Dunn elevated her nose and looked out of the window
Then she led another small trump

You say that Miss Caroline and her brother expect you she said You
surprise me Are you sure

Oh yes maam Im sure When Mr Graves came down to see me last
week twas I told him to say Id be up pretty soon to look the ground
over This is a pretty fine place the young folks have got here he
added gazing admiringly at the paintings and bookcases

Yes assented the lady condescendingly For an apartment it is
really quite livable

Livable Captain Elishas astonishment got the better of his
politeness for the moment Um Yes I should say a body _might_ manage
to worry along in it Was the place where they used to live any finer
than this

Certainly

You dont tell me No wonder they talked about economiHumph

What were you about to say Mr Warren

Oh nothin nothin Talkin to myself is a habit Ive got Abbiemy
second cousin I guess I told you about hersays its a sure sign that
a persons rich or out of his head one or tother I aint rich so
He chuckled once more

Mr Graves came to see you at your home did he

Yes maam At South Denboro And he certainly did have a rough
passage Ho ho Probably you heard about it bein so friendly with the
family

Ahem Doubtless he would have mentioned it but he has been ill

Sho Im sorry to hear that I was afraid hed catch cold

Yes I hope Mr Gravess errand was successful

Well sort of soso

Yes He came to see you in connection with your brothers estatesome
legacy perhaps

She did not look at the captain when she asked this question Therefore
she did not notice the glance which he gave her When he answered it
was in the same deliberate provokingly deliberate manner

Umhm Somethin of that kind Mrs Dunn I cant help thinkin he
went on how nice it is that Caroline and Steve have such a good friend
as you to help em Your husband and Bije was chums I spose

No not exactly The friendship was on my side of the family

So Want to know Your husband dead maam

Mrs Dunn changed the subject Her husband Mr Corcoran Dunnonce Mike
Dunn contractor and Tammany politicianwas buried in Calvary Cemetery
She mourned him after a fashion but she preferred not to talk about
him

Yes she answered shortly Itit looks as if it might snow doesnt
it

I shouldnt wonder Have you any children maam

Onea son The widows tone was frigid

So He must be a comfort to you I spose likely hes a friend of my
nephew and niece too

Certainly

Thats good Young folks ought to have young friends You live in this
neighborhood maam

The lady did not answer She gazed haughtily at the trees in the Park
Captain Elisha rubbed a smile from his lips with his hand and remained
silent The tall clock ticked loud

There came the sound of laughter from the passage outside The hall
door opened A moment later Caroline followed by her brother and young
Dunn entered the library

The girls cheeks were rosy from the cold wind Her hair beneath the
fur auto cap had blown in brown rippled disorder across her forehead
She was smiling

Oh Mrs Dunn she cried Im so glad I accepted
yourMalcolmsinvitation We had a glorious ride I

She stopped short Captain Warren had risen from his chair and was
facing her Mrs Dunn also rose

Caroline she said nervously thispausing on the wordgentleman
is here to see you He says he is

The captain interrupted her Stepping forward he seized his nieces
hands in his Well well he exclaimed admiringly Bijes girl that
I aint seen since you was a little mite of a baby Caroline Im your
Uncle Elisha

Good _Lord_ groaned Stephen Warren




CHAPTER IV


If the captain heard Stephens fervent ejaculation he paid no attention
to it Dropping his nieces hand he extended his own toward his nephew

And this is Stephen he said Well Steve you and me have never met
afore I blieve But thats our misfortune not our fault hey How are
you Pretty smart

The boys face was flaming He mumbled something to the effect that he
was all right enough and turned away without accepting the proffered
hand Captain Elisha glanced quickly at him then at his sister

Well Caroline he said pleasantly I spose youve been expectin
me Mr Graves told you I was comin didnt he

Miss Warren also was flushed with embarrassment and mortified
surprise

No she stammered He has been ill

Sho you dont say Mrs Dunnyour friend heresaid he was laid up
with a cold but I didnt realize twas as bad as that So you didnt
know I was comin at all

No Wewe have not heard from you since he returned

Thats too bad I hope I shant put you out any droppin in on
you this way You mustnt treat me as compny you know If taint
convenient if your spare room aint ready so soon after movin or
anything of that kind I can go to a hotel somewheres for a day or so
Hadnt I better dont you think

Caroline hesitated If only they might have been spared this public
humiliation If the Dunns had not been there It was bad enough to
have this dreadful country uncle come at all but to have him come now
before they were prepared before any explanations had been made What
should she do

Her brother fidgeting at her elbow not daring to look at Malcolm
Dunn who he knew was thoroughly enjoying the scene could stand it no
longer

Caro he snapped what are you waiting for Dont you _know_ that the
rooms are not ready Of course theyre not Were sorry and all that
but Graves didnt tell us and we werent prepared Certainly hell have
to go to the hotel forfor the present

He ventured to raise his eyes and glare indignantly at the captain
Finding the latter looking intently at him he dropped them again and
jammed his clenched fists into his pockets

Captain Elisha pulled thoughtfully at his beard

Humph he grunted Humph then I callate maybe He took a step
toward the door stopped turned back and said with calm decision I
guess Id better stay You wont mind me Carolineyou and Stephen You
_mustnt_ As I said I aint compny Im one of the family your pas
brother and Ive come some considerble ways to see you two young folks
and talk with you Ive come because your pa asked me to Im used to
roughin it been to sea a good many vyages and if a feather bed aint
handy I can get my forty winks on the floor So thats settled and you
mustnt have me on your conscience Thats sense aint it Mrs Dunn

Mrs Corcoran Dunn did not deign a reply Caroline answered for her

Very well she said coldly Stepping to the desk she rang a bell The
butler appeared in the doorway

Edwards said Miss Warren this gentleman indicating the captain
is to be our guest for the present You may show him to his roomthe
blue room I think If it is not ready see that it is made so

Yes Miss Caroline replied Edwards Retiring to the hall he returned
with the suitcase

Will you wish to go to your room at once sir he asked

Why I guess I might as well Commodore answered Captain Elisha
smiling Little soap and water wont do no harm Fact is I feels if
twas a prescription to be recommended You neednt tote that valise
though he added Taint heavy and Ive lugged it so fur already
sence I got off the car that I feel kind of lonesome without it

The butler not knowing exactly how to answer grinned sheepishly
Captain Elisha turned to Mrs Dunn and her son

Well good afternoon maam he said Im real glad to have made your
acquaintance Yours too sir with a nod toward Malcolm Your mother
told me what a friend of the young folks you was and as Im sort
of actin pilot for em just now in a way of speakin any friend of
theirs ought to be a friend of mine Hope to see you often Mr Dunn

The young man addressed smiled with amusement not at all concealed and
languidly admitted that he was charmed

Your first visit to the city he inquired in a tone which caused
Stephen to writhe inwardly

Noo No not exactly I used to come here pretty frequent back in
my seagoin days when my ship was in port I sailed for Osgood and
Colton down on South Street for a spell They were my owners You
dont remember the firm I spose

No The privilege has been denied me You find some changes in
New York dont youerCaptain You are a captain or a bosn or
admiralsomething of that sort I presume

Malcolm said his mother sharply

Oh no offense intended My sea terms are rather mixed The captain
will excuse me

Sartin Capns what they all call me mostly Your son aint ever been
to sea except as passenger I callate maam

Certainly not snapped Mrs Dunn

Of course of course Well taint a life Id want a boy of mine
to take up nowadays But it did have some advantages I dont know
anything better than a vyage afore the mast to learn a young feller
whats healthy for him to unlearn Good day maam Good day Mr Dunn
I mustnt keep the Commodore waitin here with that valise Ill be
out pretty soon Caroline just as soon as Ive got the upper layer
of railroad dust off my face and hands Youll be surprised to see how
lightcomplected I really am when thats over All right Heave ahead
Commodore

He departed preceded by Edwards and the suitcase Stephen Warren threw
himself violently into a chair by the window Young Dunn laughed aloud
His mother flashed an indignant glance at him and then hurried to
Caroline

You poor dear she exclaimed putting an arm about the girls
shoulder Dont mind us please dont Malcolm and I understand That
is we know how you feel and

Oh but you _dont_ know Mrs Dunn cried Caroline almost in tears
You dont understand Its so much worse than you think IIOh why
did father do it How could he be so inconsiderate

There there purred the friend of the family You mustnt you know
You really mustnt Who is this man This uncle Where does he come
from Why does he force himself upon you in this way I didnt know your
poor father had a brother

Neither did we growled Stephen savagely Malcolm laughed again

What does it all mean dear begged Mrs Dunn You are in trouble
Im sure Dont you think weMalcolm and Imight be able to help you
We should so love to do it If you feel that you _can_ confide in us
if it isnt a secret

She paused expectantly patting the girls shoulder But Caroline had
heard young Dunns laugh and was offended and hurt Her eyes flashed as
she answered

Its nothing she said He has come to see us on a matter of
business I believe I am nervous andfoolish I suppose Mr Graves
will see us soon and then everything will be arranged Thank you for
calling Mrs Dunn and for the ride

It was a very plain hint but Mrs Dunn did not choose to understand it
as such

Youre sure you hadnt better tell me the whole story dear she
urged I am old enough almost to be your mother and perhaps my
advice might No Very well You know best butYou understand that
it is something other than mere curiosity which leads me to ask

Of course I understand said the girl hastily Thank you very much
Perhaps by and by I can tell you everything But we must see Mr
Graves first Ioh _dont_ ask me more now Mrs Dunn

The widow of so astute a politician as Mike Dunn had been in his day
could have scarcely failed to profit by his teachings Moreover she
possessed talent of her own With a final pat and a kiss she prepared
for departure

Goodby then she said or rather _au revoir_ We shall look in
tomorrow Come Malcolm

I say Mal cried Stephen rising hurriedly You wont tell anyone
about

Steve interrupted his sister

Malcolm about to utter a languid sarcasm caught his mothers look and
remained silent Another meaning glance and his manner changed

All right Steve old man he said Goodby and good luck Caroline
awfully glad we had the spin this afternoon We must have more Just
what you and Steve need At your service any time If there is anything
I can do in any way toeryou understandcall on me wont you
Ready Mater

The pair were shown out by Edwards On the way home in the car Mrs
Corcoran Dunn lectured her son severely

Have you no common sense she demanded Couldnt you see that the
girl would have told me everything if you hadnt laughed like an
idiot

The young man laughed again

By Jove he exclaimed it was enough to make a wooden Indian laugh
The old jay with the barnacles telling us about the advantages of a
sailors life And Steves face Ho ho

His mother snorted disgust If you had brains she declared you
would have understood what he meant by saying that the sea was the place
to learn what to unlearn He was hitting at you Was it necessary to
insult him the first time you and he exchanged a word

Insult him _Him_ Ha ha Why Mater whats the matter with you Do
you imagine that a hayseed like that would recognize an insult without
an introduction And besides what difference does it make You dont
intend putting him on your calling list do you

I intend cultivating him for the present

_Cultivating_ him

Yesfor the present He is Rodgers Warrens brother That lawyer
Graves traveled miles to see him What does that mean That in some
important way he is connected with the estate and those two children
If the estate is worth anything and we have reason to believe it is
you and I must know it If it isnt it is even more important that we
should know before we waste more time If Caroline is an heiress if
she inherits even a moderate fortune

She shrugged her shoulders by way of finish to the sentence

Malcolm whistled

But to think of that old DownEaster being related to the Warren
family he mused It seems impossible

Nothing is impossible observed his mother Then with a shudder You
never met your fathers relatives I have

     

When Captain Elisha emerged from his room after a wash and a change
of linen he found the library untenanted He strolled about his hands
behind him inspecting the pictures with critical interest Caroline
dressed for dinner found him thus engaged He turned at the sound of
her step

Why hello he cried with hearty enthusiasm All rigged up for
inspection aint you

Inspection

Oh thats just sailors lingo Means youve got your Sunday uniform
on thats all My my how nice you look But aint black pretty old
for such a young girl

I am in mourning replied his niece coldly

There there of course you are Tut tut How could I forget it You
see Ive been so many years feelin as if I didnt have a brother that
Ive sort of got used to his bein gone

I have not Her eyes filled as she said it The captain was greatly
moved

Im a blunderin old fool my dear he said I beg your pardon Do
try to forgive me wont you And perhapsperhaps I can make up your
loss to you just a little mite Id like to Ill try to if

He laid a hand on her shoulder She avoided him and moving away seated
herself in a chair at the opposite side of the desk The avoidance was
so obvious as to be almost brutal Captain Elisha looked very grave for
an instant Then he changed the subject

I was lookin at your oil paintins he said Theyre pretty fine
aint they Any of them your work Caroline

_My_ work The girls astonishment was so great that she turned to
stare at her questioner _My_ work she repeated Are you joking You
cant think that I painted them

I didnt know but you might That one over there with the trees and
folks dancinsort of picnic scene I judgethat looks as if you might
have done it

That is a Corot

Tis hey I want to know Aawhat did you call it

A Corot He was a famous French artist That was fathers favorite
picture

Sho Well I like it fustrate myself Did Bijedid your father know
this Mr Corot well

Know him Certainly not Why should you think such a thing as that

Well he bought the picture of him and so I spose likely he knew him
There was a young feller come to South Denboro three or four year
ago and offered to paint a picture of our place for fifteen dollars
Abbiethats Abbie Baker shes one of our folks you know your third
cousin Caroline keepin house for me she isAbbie wanted me to have
him do the job but I want very particular about it so it never come
to nothin He done two or three places though and I swan twas nice
work He painted Sam Cahoons old ramshackle house and barn and youd
hardly know it twas so fixed up and fine in the picture White paint
and green grass and everything just like real He left out the places
where the pickets was off the fence and the blinds hangin on one hinge
I told Abbie I says Abbie that painters made Sams place look
almost respectable and if that aint a miracle I dont know what is
I would think Sam would blush every time he sees that picture Ho ho
Abbie seemed to callate that Sam Cahoons blushin would be the biggest
miracle of the two Ho ho Youd like Abbie shes got lots of common
sense

He chuckled at the reminiscence and rubbed his knee His niece made no
reply Captain Elisha glanced at the Corot once more and asked another
question

I presume likely he said that that picture cost considerble more
than fifteen hey

Father paid twentytwo thousand dollars for it was the crushing
answer

The captain looked at her opened his mouth to speak shut it again
and rising walked across the room Adjusting his glasses he inspected
the Corot in silence for a few minutes Then he drew a long breath

Well he sighed _Well_ Then after an interval Was this the only
one he ever painted

The only one The only picture Corot painted Of course not There are
many more

Diddid this Corot feller get as much for every job as he did for
this

I presume so I know father considered this one a bargain

Did hey Humph I ought to know enough by this time not to believe all
I hear but I kind of had an idea that picture paintin was starvation
work Ive read about artists committin suicide and livin in attics
and such Whew About two such bargain sale jobs as this and
Id guarantee not to starveand to live as nigh the ground as a
secondfloor bedroom anyhow How about this next one This feller in a
dorycoddin I guess he is Diddid Mr Corot do him

No That is by a wellknown American artist It is a good piece of
work but not like the other It is worth much less Perhaps five
thousand

So Well even for that Id undertake to buy considerble many dories
and hire fellers to fish from em too Humph I guess Im out of
soundins When I thought fifteen dollars was a high price for paintin
a view of a house I was slightly mistaken Next time Ill offer the
paintin feller the house and ask him what he considers a fair boot
besides Sam Cahoons a better speculator than I thought he was Hello
Commodore whats worryin you now

Edwards appeared to announce that dinner was served Caroline rose
and led the way to the dining room Captain Elisha followed looking
curiously about him as he did so Stephen who had been sulkily dressing
in his own room entered immediately after

The captain surveyed the dining room with interest Like the others
of the suite it was sumptuously and tastefully furnished He took the
chair indicated by the solemn Edwards and the meal began

The butlers sense of humor was not acute but it was with considerable
difficulty that he restrained his smiles during the next half hour A
more appreciative observer would have noticed and enjoyed the subtler
points Stephens glare of disgust at his uncle when the latter tucked
his napkin in the opening of his waistcoat Carolines embarrassment
when the captain complimented the soup declaring that it was almost
as good as one of Abbies chowders the visitors obvious uneasiness at
being waited upon attentively and the like These Edwards missed but
he could not help appreciating Captain Elishas conversation

Caroline said little during dinner Her brother glowered at his plate
and was silent But the captain talked and talked

Maybe you think I didnt have a time findin your new lodgins
he said I come over on the cars somethin I dont usually do when
theres anything afloat to carry me But I had an errand or two to do
in Boston so I stopped over night at the hotel there and got the nine
oclock train I landed here in New York all shipshape and on time and
started in to hunt you up

How did you get our address asked his niece Mr Graves couldnt
have given it to you for we only decided on this apartment a few days
ago

Ho ho chuckled Captain Elisha rolling in his chair like a ship in
a cross sea Ho ho You remind me of Abbie Caroline Thats what she
said I never heard of such a crazy cruise she says Startin off
to visit folks when you havent the least idea where they live Oh
yes I have I says I know where they live they live in New York
Well you ought to have seen her face Abbies a good womannone
betterbut she generally dont notice a joke until she trips over it
I get considerble fun out of Abbie take her by the large New York
she says Did anybody ever hear the beat of that Do you callate New
Yorks like South Denboro where everybody knows everybody else What
are you plannin to do run up the fust man woman or child you meet and
ask em to tell you where Bijah Warren lives Or are you goin to trot
from Dan to Beersheby trustin to meet your nephew and niece on the
way I never in my born days

Well went on the captain I told her that the last suggestion
werent such a bad one but there was one little objection to it
Considerin that I hadnt ever laid eyes on Steve and that I hadnt seen
you since you was a baby the chances was against my recognizin you
if we did meet Ho ho ho Finally I hinted that I might look in the
directory and she got more reconciled to my startin Honest I do
believe shed have insisted on takin me by the hand and leadin me to
you if I hadnt told her that

Illustration The captain talked and talked

So I did look in the directory and got the number on Fifth Avenue where
you used to be I asked a policeman the nighest way to get there and
he said take a bus Last time I was in New York I rode in one of those
Fifth Avenue omnibuses and I never got such a jouncin in my life
The pavement then was round cobble stones like some of the roads
in Nantucket I remember I tried to ask a feller that set next to me
somethin or other and I swan to man I couldnt get nothin out of my
mouth but rattles Metropolitan Museum sounded like puttin in a ton
of coal I thought I was comin apart or my works was out of order or
somethin but when the feller tried to answer he rattled just as bad
so I realized twas the reglar disease and felt some better I never
shall forget a fleshy womansomethin like that Mrs Dunn friend of
yours Carolinethat set opposite me It give me the crawls to look at
her her chins shook around so Ho ho she had no lessn three of em
and they all shook different ways Ho ho ho If Id been in the habit
of wearin false hair or teeth or anything that want growed to or
buttoned on me Id never have risked a trip in one of those omnibuses

So when the police officer prescribed one for me this vyage I was
some dubious Im oldern I was ten year ago and I want sure that Id
hold together I callated walkin was better for my health So I found
Fifth Avenue and started to walk And the farther I walked the heavier
that blessed satchel of mine got It weighed maybe ten or twelve pounds
at the corner of 42nd Street but when I got as far as the open square
where the gilt woman is hurryin to keep from bein run over by Genral
Sherman on horsebackthat statue you knowI wouldnt have let that
blessed bag go for lessn two ton if I was sellin it by weight So
I leaned up against an electric light pole to rest and sort of get my
bearins Then I noticed what Id ought to have seen afore that the
street want paved with cobbles as it used to be but was smooth as
a stretch of state road down home So I figgered that a bus was a safe
risk after all I waited ten minutes or more for one to come and
finally I asked a woman who was in tow of an astrakhantrimmed dog at
the end of a chain if the omnibuses had stopped runnin When I fust
see the dog leadin her I thought she was blind but I guess she
was deef and dumb instead Anyhow all she said was Ugh not very
enthusiastic at that and went along Ho ho So then I asked a man
and he pointed to a bus right in front of me You see I was lookin for
the horses same as they used to be and this was an automobile

I blushed I guess just to show that there was some red underneath
the green and climbed aboard the omnibus I rode along for a spell
admirin as much of the scenery as I could see between the womens hats
then I told the skipper of the thing that I wanted to make port at 82nd
Street He said Ugh apparently suffrin from the same complaint the
dog woman had and we went on and on At last I got kind of anxious and
asked him again

Eightysecond says he ugly This is Ninetyfirst

Good land says I I wanted Eightysecond

Why didnt you say so says he lookin as if Id stole his mothers
spoons

I did says I

You _did_ he snarls You did not If you did wouldnt I have heard
you

Well any answer Id be likely to make to that would have meant more
argument and the bus was sailin right along at the time so I piled
out and did some more walkin the other way At last I reached your old
number Stevie andHey Did you speak

Dont call me Stevie growled his nephew rebelliously

Beg your pardon I keep forgettin that youre almost grown up Well
as I was sayin I got to the house where you used to live and twas
shut tight Nobody there Ho ho I felt a good deal like old Beriah
Doane must have on his last vacation You see Beriah is one of our
South Denboro notorieties hes famous in his way He works and loafs
by spells until cranberry pickin time in the fall then he picks steady
and earns thirty or forty dollars all at once Soons hes paid off he
starts for Boston on a vacation an alcoholic one Well last fall
his married sister was visitin him and she bein strong for good
Templarism was determined he shouldnt vacate in his regular way So
she telegraphed her husbands brother in Brockton to meet Beriah there
go with him to Boston and see that he behaved himself and stayed sober
Beriah heard of it and when his train gets as far as Tremont what does
he do but get off quiet and change cars for New Bedford He hadnt been
there for nine years but he had pleasant memories of his last visit
And when he does get to New Bedford chucklin over the way hes
befooled his sister and her folks Im blessed if he didnt find that
the town had gone nolicense and every saloon was shut up Ho ho ho
Well I felt about the way he did I guess when I stood on the steps
of your Fifth Avenue house and realized youd gone away I wouldnt have
had Abbie see me there for somethin Ho ho

He leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud Caroline smiled faintly
Stephen threw down his napkin and sprang to his feet

Sis he cried Im going to my room By gad I cant

Catching a warning glance from his sister he did not finish his
sentence but stood sulkily beside his chair Captain Elisha looked at
him then at the girl and stopped laughing He folded his napkin with
care and rose

Thats about all of it he said shortly I asked around at two or
three of the neighbors houses and the last one I asked knew where
youd moved and told me how to get here

When the trio were again in the library the captain spoke once more

Im fraid Ive talked too much he said gravely I didnt realize
how I was runnin on Thought I was home I guess with the fellers of
my own age down at the postoffice instead of bein an old countryman
tirin out you two young city folks with my yarns I beg your pardon
Now you mustnt mind me I see youre expectin company or goin callin
somewheres so Ill just go to my bedroom and write Abbie a line Shell
be kind of anxious to know if I got here safe and sound and found you
Dont worry about me Ill be comftable and busy

He turned to go Caroline looked at him in surprise We are not
expecting callers she said And certainly we are not going out
tonight Why should you think such a thing

It was her uncles turn to show surprise

Why he said with a glance at Stephen I see that youre all dressed
up and so I thought naturally

He paused

Young Warren grunted contemptuously

We dressed for dinner that is all said Caroline

Youyou mean you put these clothes on every night

Certainly

Captain Elisha was plainly very much astonished

Well he observed slowly Iguess Ive made another mistake Hum
Good night

Good night said Stephen quickly Caroline however seemed
embarrassed

Captain Warren she said I thought possibly you might wish to talk
business with my brother and me Wewe understand that you have come
on business connected with fathers will It seems to me that the sooner
wewe

Get it over the better hey Well maybe youre right Its an odd
business for an old salt like me to be mixed up in thats a fact If it
hadnt been so odd if I hadnt thought there must be some reason some
particlar reason Iwell I guess Id have stayed to home where I
belong You mustnt think he added seriously that I dont realize
Im as out of place amongst you and your rich friends as a live fish in
a barrel of sawdust Thats all right you neednt trouble to say no
But you must understand that realizin it Im not exactly imposin
myself on you for pleasure orwell from choice Im so built that I
cant shirk when my conscience tells me I shouldnt thats all Im
kind of tired tonight and I guess you are Tomorrow mornin if its
agreeable to all hands we will have a little business talk Ill have
to see Lawyer Graves pretty soon and have a genral look at your pas
affairs Then if everything is all right and I feel my dutys done
Ill probably go back to the Cape and leave you to him or somebody else
able to look out for you Until then Im afraid with a smile which had
a trace of bitterness in it Im afraid youll have to do the best you
can with me Ill try to be no more of a nuisance than I can help Good
night

When the two young people were left alone Caroline turned to her
brother

Steve she said Im afraid you were a little rude Im afraid you
hurt his feelings

The boy stared at her in wonder Hurt his feelings he exclaimed
_His_ feelings Well by Jove Caro youre a wonder Did you expect me
to throw my arms around his neck If he had had any feelings at all if
he was the slightest part of a gentleman do you suppose he would come
here and disgrace us as he is doing Who invited him Did we I guess
not

But he is fathers brother and father asked him to come

No he didnt He asked himheaven knows whyto look out for our
money affairs Thats bad enough but he didnt ask him to _live_ with
us He shant by gad he shant _You_ may be as sweet to him as you
like but Ill make it my business to give him the cold shoulder every
chance I get Ill freeze him out thats what Ill dofreeze him out
Why Caro be sensible Think what his staying here means Can we take
him about with us Can our friends meet _him_ asas our uncle Hes got
to be made to go Hasnt he now Hasnt he

The girl was silent for a moment Then she covered her face with her
hands Oh yes she sobbed Oh yes he must he _Must_ _Why_ did
father do it




CHAPTER V


The Warren breakfast hour was nine oclock At a quarter to nine
Caroline entering the library found Stephen seated by the fire reading
the morning paper

Good morning she said Then looking about the room asked Hashas
_he_ been here

Her brother shook his head You mean Uncle Lish he asked
cheerfully No he hasnt At least I havent seen him and I havent
made any inquiries I shall manage to survive if he never appears Let
sleeping relatives lie thats my motto

He laughed at his own joke and turned the page of the paper The butler
entered

Breakfast is served Miss Caroline he announced

Has Captain Warren come from his room asked the young lady

No Miss Caroline That is I havent seen him

Stephen tossed the paper on the floor and rose

I wonder he began Then with a broad grin A sudden thought
strikes me Sis He has undoubtedly blown out the gas

Steve How can you

Perfectly simple Absolutely reasonable Just what might have been
expected He has gone but we shall miss him Come on Caro Im
hungry Let the old hayseed sleep You and I can have a meal in peace
Heavens you dont care for another experience like last nights do
you

Edwards said Caroline you may knock at Captain Warrens door and
tell him breakfast is served

Yes commanded Stephen and tell him not to hurry on our account
Come Caro come Youre not pining for his society Well wait then
_I_ wont

He marched angrily out of the room His sister hesitated her wish
to follow complicated by a feeling of duty to a guest no matter how
unwelcome The butler reappeared looking puzzled

Hes not there miss he said

Not there Not in his room

No Miss Caroline I knocked and he didnt answer so I looked in and
he wasnt there His beds been slept in but hes gone

Gone And you havent seen him

No miss Ive been up and about since half past seven and I cant
understand where he could have got to

The door of the hall opened and shut Edwards darted from the library
A moment afterwards Captain Elisha strolled in He was wearing his
overcoat and his hat was in his hand

Good mornin Caroline he hailed in his big voice Surprised to see
me are you Ho ho So was the Commodore He couldnt understand how
I got in without ringin Well you see Im used to turnin out pretty
early and when it got to be most seven oclock I couldnt lay to bed
any longer so I got up dressed and went for a walk I fixed the door
latch sos I could come in quiet You havent waited breakfast for me I
hope

No it is ready now however

Ready now the captain looked at his watch Yes I should think so
Its way into the forenoon You _have_ waited for me havent you Im
awfully sorry

No we have not waited Our breakfast hour is nine Pardon me for
neglecting to tell you that last evening

Oh thats all right Now you trot right out and eat Ive had mine

Had your breakfast

Yes indeed When Im home Abbie and I usually eat about seven so I
get sort of sharpset if I wait after that I callated you city folks
was late sleepers and I wouldnt want to make any trouble so I found
a little eatin house down below here a ways and had a cup of coffee and
some bread and butter and mush Then I went cruisin round in Central
Park a spell This _is_ Central Park over across here aint it

Yes The girl was too astonished to say more

I thought twas Id been through part of it afore but twas years
ago and its such a big place and the paths run so crisscross I got
sort of mixed up and it took me longer to get out than it did to get
in I had the genral points of the compass and I guess I could have
made a pretty average straight run for home but every time I wanted to
cut across lots there was a policeman lookin at me so I had to stick
to the channel Thats what made me so late Now do go and eat your
breakfast I wont feel easy till I see you start

Caroline departed and the captain after a visit to his own room where
he left his coat and hat returned to the library picked up the paper
which his nephew had dropped and began reading

After breakfast came the business talk It was a brief one Captain
Elisha soon discovered that his brothers children knew very little
concerning their fathers affairs They had always plenty of money had
been indulged in practically every wish and had never had to think or
plan for themselves As to the size of the estate they knew nothing
more than Mr Graves had told them which was that instead of the
several millions which rumor had credited A Rodgers Warren with
possessing five hundred thousand dollars would probably be the extent
of their inheritance and that therefore they must live economically
As a first step in that direction they had given up their former home
and moved to the apartment

Yes yes mused the captain I see Mr Graves didnt know about your
movin then You did it on your own hook so to speak

Stephen answered promptly

Of course we did he declared Why not

No reason in the world A good sensible thing to do I should say
Didnt anybody advise you where to go

Why should we need advice Again it was Stephen who replied We
arent kids Were old enough to decide some things for ourselves I
should think

Yes Sartin Thats right But I didnt know but praps some of your
friends might have helped along This Mrs Dunn now she kind of hinted
to me that shedwell done what she could to make you comftable

She has avowed Caroline warmly Mrs Dunn and Malcolm have proved
their friendship in a thousand ways We never can repay them Stephen
and I never

No Theres some things you cant ever pay I know that Mrs Dunn
found this nice place for you did she

Why yes She and I found it together

So That was lucky want it Advertised in the newspaper was it or
was there a To Let placard up in the window

No certainly not Mrs Dunn knew that we had decided to move and she
has a cousin who is interested in New York property She asked him and
he mentioned this apartment

One of his own was it

I believe so Why are you so particular Dont you like it

Her tone was sharp Stephen who resented his uncles questions as
impertinent intrusions upon the family affairs added one of his own

Isnt it as good as those inwhat do you call itSouth Denboro he
asked maliciously

Captain Elisha laughed heartily

Pretty nigh as good he said I didnt notice any better on the way
to the depot as I drove up And I doubt if theres many new ones built
since I left Its a mighty fine lot of rooms I think Whats the rent
Youll excuse my askin things bein as they are

Twentytwo hundred a year answered his niece coldly

The captain looked at her whistled broke off the whistle in the
middle and did a little mental arithmetic

Twentytwo hundred a year he repeated Thats one hundred and
eighty odd a month Say that cousin of Mrs Dunns must want to get his
investment back You mean for just these ten rooms

Stephen laughed scornfully

Our guardian has been counting Caro he remarked

Yes Yes I counted this mornin when I got up I was interested
naturally

Sure Naturally of course sneered the boy Did you think the
twentytwo hundred was the rent of the entire building

Well I didnt know I

The rent interrupted Caroline with dignity was twentyfour
hundred but thanks to Mrs Dunn who explained to her cousin that we
were friends of hers it was reduced

We being in reduced circumstances observed her brother in supreme
disgust Pity the poor orphans By gad

That was real nice of Mrs Dunn declared Captain Elisha heartily
Shes pretty welloff herself I sposehey Caroline

I presume so

Yes yes About how much is she wuth think

I dont know I never inquired

No Well down our way with a chuckle we dont have to inquire Ask
anybody you meet what his next door neighbors wuth and hell tell you
within a hundred and how he got it and how much he owes and how he
gets along with his wife Ho ho Speakin of wives is this Mr Dunn
married

He looked at his niece as he asked the question There was no reason why
Caroline should blush she knew it and hated herself for doing it

No she answered resentfully he is not

Umhm Whats his business

He is connected with a produce exchange house I believe

One of the firm

I dont know In New York we are not as well posted or as curious
concerning our friends private affairs as your townspeople seem to be

I guess thats so I imagine New Yorkers are too busy gettin it
themselves to bother whether their neighbors have got it or not Well
he went on rising I guess Ive kept you young folks from your work
oror play or whatever you was going to do long enough for this once
I think Ill go out for a spell Ive got an errand or two I want to do
What time do you have dinner

We lunch at half past one answered Caroline

We dine at seven

Oh yes yes I keep forgettin that suppers dinner Well I presume
likely Ill be back for luncheon If I aint dont wait for me Ill be
home afore supperthere I go againafore dinner anyhow Goodby

Five minutes later he was at the street corner inquiring of a policeman
the handiest way to get to Pine Street Following the directions
given he boarded a train at the nearest subway station emerged at Wall
Street inquired once more located the street he was looking for and
consulting a card which he took from a big stained leather pocketbook
walked on peering at the numbers of the buildings he passed

The offices of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves were on the sixteenth floor
of a new and gorgeously appointed skyscraper When Captain Elisha
entered the firms reception room he was accosted by a wideawake and
extremely selfpossessed office boy

Whod you want to see asked the boy briskly

The captain removed his hat and wiped his forehead with his
handkerchief

Hold on a jiffy Sonny he panted Just give me a minute to sort of
get myself together as you might say I rode up in one of those express
elevators of yours and I kind of feel as if my boots had got tangled up
with my necktie When that elevator feller cast off from the cellar I
begun to shut up like a spyglass Whew Say Son is Mr Graves in

No replied the boy grinning

Hum Still in the sick bay is hehey

Hes to home Got a cold

Yup Its too bad MrerSylvester is he in

Naw he aint And Mr Kuhns busy Wont one of the clerks do What do
you want to see the firm about

Well Son I had reasons of my own However I guess I wont disturb
Mr Kuhn if hes busys you say Here you tell him or Mr Sylvester
when he comes that Capn Warren Capn Elisha Warren of South
Denborobetter write it downcalled and will be back about half past
twelve or thereabouts Got it have you Hum is that Elisha You dont
tell me Ive been spellin it for sixty years more or less and never
realized it had such possibilities Lend me your pencil There you give
Mr Sylvester that and tell him Ill see him later So long Son

He departed smiling The indignant office boy threw the card on the
table

Captain Elisha strolled down Pine Street looking about him with
interest It had been years since he visited this locality and the
changes were many Soon however he began to recognize familiar
landmarks He was approaching the water front and there were fewer new
buildings When he reached South Street he was thoroughly at home

The docks were crowded The river was alive with small craft of all
kinds Steamers and schooners were plenty but the captain missed the
old squareriggers the clipper ships and barks such as he had sailed
in as cabin boy as foremast hand and later commanded on many seas

At length however he saw four masts towering above the roof of a
freight house They were not schooner rigged those masts The yards
were set square across and along them were furled royals and upper
topsails Here at last was a craft worth looking at Captain Elisha
crossed the street hurried past the covered freight house and saw a
magnificent great ship lying beside a broad open wharf Down the wharf
he walked joyfully as one who greets an old friend

The wharf was practically deserted An ancient watchman was dozing in
a sort of sentry box but he did not wake There was a pile of
foreignlooking crates and boxes at the further end of the pier
evidently the last bit of cargo waiting to be carted away The captain
inspected the pile recognized the goods as Chinese and Japanese then
read the name on the big ships stern She was the _Empress of the
Ocean_ and her home port was Liverpool

Captain Elisha as a freeborn Yankee skipper had an inherited and
cherished contempt for British limejuicers but he could not help
admiring this one To begin with her size and tonnage were enormous
Also she was fourmasted instead of the usual three and her hull and
lower spars were of steel instead of wood A steel sailing vessel was
something of a novelty to the captain and he was seized with a desire
to go aboard and inspect

The ladder from ship to wharf was down of course and getting on board
was an easy matter When he reached the deck and looked about him the
great size of the ship was still more apparent The bulwarks were as
high as a short mans head She was decked over aft and as the captain
said afterwards her cabins had nigh as many stories as a house
From the roof of the first story level with the bulwarks extended
a series of bridges which could be hoisted or lowered and by means of
which her officers could walk from stern to bow without descending to
the deck There was a goodsized engine house forward beyond the galley
and forecastle Evidently the work of hoisting anchors and canvas was
done by steam

The captain strolled about looking her over The number of improvements
since his seagoing days was astonishing He was standing by the wheel
near the companion way wishing that he might inspect the officers
quarters but not liking to do so without an invitation when two men
emerged from the cabin

One of the pair was evidently the Japanese steward of the ship The
other was a tall cleancut young fellow whose general appearance and
lack of sunburn showed quite plainly that he was not a seafaring man
by profession The steward caught sight of Captain Elisha and walking
over accosted him

Want to see skipper sir he asked in broken English He ashore

No Doctor replied the captain cheerfully I dont want to see
him Ive got no business aboard Its been some time since I trod the
quarterdeck of a squarerigger and I couldnt resist the temptation
of tryin how the planks felt under my feet This is considerble of a
clipper youve got here he added

Yes sir replied the steward grinning

Where you from asked Captain Elisha

Singapore sir

Cargo all out

Yes sir

Waitin for another one

Yes sir We load for Manila bimeby

Manila hey Have a good passage across

Yes sir She good ship

Shouldnt wonder How dye do sir to the young man who was standing
near Hope you wont think Im crowdin in where I dont belong I was
just tellin the doctor here that it had been some time since I trod a
quarterdeck and I thought Id see if Id forgot the feel

Have you asked the young man smiling

Guess not Seems kind of natral I never handled such a whale of a
craft as this though Didnt have many of em in my day Come over in
her did you

No with a shake of the head No such luck Im a land lubber just
scouting round thats all Shes a bully vessel isnt she

Looks so Tell you better after Ive seen what she could do in a
fullsail breeze All hands ashore Doctor

Yes sir replied the steward

Crew paid off and spendin their money I spose Well if it aint
against orders Id kind of like to look around a little mite May I

The steward merely grinned His companion answered for him

Certainly you may he said Im a friend of one of the consignees
and Id be glad to show you the ship if you like Shall we begin with
the cabins

Captain Elisha delighted with the opportunity expressed his thanks
and the tour of inspection began The steward remained on deck but the
captain and his new acquaintance strolled through the officers quarters
together

Jerushy exclaimed the former as he viewed the main cabin Say you
could pretty nigh have a dance here couldnt you A small one This
reminds me of the cabin aboard the _Sea Gull_ first vessel I went mate
ofits so diffrent Aboard her we had to walk sittin down There
want room in the cabin for moren one to stand up at a time But she
could sail just the sameand carry it too Ive seen her off the Horn
with studdin sails set when craft twice her length and tonnage had
everything furled above the topsl yard Hi hum you mustnt mind an old
salt runnin on this way Ive been out of the pickle tub a good while
but I callate the brine aint all out of my system

His guides eyes snapped

I understand he said laughing Ive never been at sea on a long
voyage in my life but I can understand just how you feel Its in
my blood I guess I come of a salt water line My people were from
Belfast Maine and every man of them went to sea

Belfast hey They turned out some A No 1 sailors in Belfast I sailed
under a Capn Pearson from there onceJames Pearson his name was

He was my great uncle I was named for him My name is James Pearson
also

_What_ Captain Elisha was hugely delighted Mr Pearson shake
hands I want to tell you that your Uncle Jim was a seaman of the kind
you dream about but seldom meet I was his second mate three vyages
My names Elisha Warren

Mr Pearson shook hands and laughed goodhumoredly

Glad to meet you Captain Warren he said And Im glad you knew
Uncle Jim As a youngster he was my idol He could spin yarns that were
worth listening to

I bet you Hed seen things wuth yarnin about So you aint a sailor
hey Livin in New York

The young man nodded Yes he said Then with a dry smile If you
call occupying a hall bedroom and eating at a thirdrate boardinghouse
table living However its my own fault Ive been a newspaper man
since I left college But I threw up my job six months ago Since then
Ive been freelancing

Have hey The captain was too polite to ask further questions but he
had not the slightest idea what freelancing might be Pearson divined
his perplexity and explained

Ive had a feeling he said that I might write magazine articles and
storiesyes possibly a novel or two Its a serious disease but
the only way to find out whether its chronic or not is to experiment
Thats what Im doing now The thing Im at work on may turn out to be
a sea story So I spend some time around the wharves and aboard the few
sailing ships in port picking up material

Captain Elisha patted him on the back

Now dont you get discouraged he said I used to have an idea that
novel writin and picture paintin was poverty jobs for men with healthy
appetites but Ive changed my mind I dont knows youll believe it
but Ive just found out for a fact that some painters get twentytwo
thousand dollars for one picture For _one_ mind you And a little mite
of a thing too that couldnt have cost scarcely anything to paint
Maybe novels sell for just as much _I_ dont know

His companion laughed heartily Im afraid not Captain he said
Few at any rate I should be satisfied with considerably less to
begin with Are you living here in town

Wellwell I dont know I aint exactly livin and I aint exactly
boardin butSay aint that the doctor callin you

It was the steward and there was an anxious ring in his voice Pearson
excused himself and hurried out of the cabin Captain Elisha lingered
for a final look about Then he followed leisurely becoming aware as
he reached the open air of loud voices in angry dialogue

Entrances to the _Empress of the Oceans_ cabins were on the main deck
and also on the raised halfdeck at the stern near the wheel the
binnacle and the officers cornedbeef tubs swinging in their frames
From this upper deck two flights of steps led down to the main deck
below At the top of one of these flights stood young Pearson cool and
alert Behind him half crouched the Japanese steward evidently very
much frightened At the foot of the steps were grouped three rough
looking men foreigners and sailors without doubt and partially
intoxicated The three men were an ugly lot and they were all yelling
and jabbering together in a foreign lingo As the captain emerged
from the passage to the open deck he heard Pearson reply in the same
language

Whats the matter he asked

Pearson answered without turning his head

Drunken sailors he explained Part of the crew here Theyve been
uptown got full and come back to square a grudge they seem to have
against the steward Im telling them theyd better give up and go
ashore if they know when theyre well off

The three fellows by the ladders foot were consulting together On the
wharf were half a dozen loungers collected by the prospect of a row

If I can hold them off for a few minutes went on Pearson well be
all right The wharf watchman has gone for the police Here drop it
What are you up to

One of the sailors had drawn a knife The other two reached for their
belts behind evidently intending to follow suit From the loafers on
the wharf came shouts of encouragement

Do the dude up Pedro Give him whats comin to him

The trio formed for a rush The steward with a shrill scream fled to
the cabin Pearson did not move he even smiled The next moment he was
pushed to one side and Captain Elisha stood at the top of the steps

Here he said sternly Whats all this

The three sailors astonished at this unexpected addition to their
enemies forces hesitated Pearson laid his hand on the captains arm

Be careful he said Theyre dangerous

Dangerous Them Ive seen their kind afore Here you turning to the
three below What do you mean by this Put down that knife you lubber
Do you want to be put in irons Over the side with you you swabs Git

He began descending the ladder Whether the sailors were merely too
surprised to resist or because they recognized the authority of the
deep sea in Captain Elishas voice and face is a question At any rate
as he descended they backed away

Mutiny on board a ship of mine roared the captain What do you mean
by it Why Ill have you tied up and put on bread and water Over the
side with you Mutiny on board of _me_ Lively Tumble up there

With every order came a stride forward and a correspondingly backward
movement on the part of the three The performance would have been
ridiculous if Pearson had not feared that it might become tragic He was
descending the steps to his new acquaintances aid when there rose a
chorus of shouts from the wharf

The cops the cops Look out

That was the finishing touch The next moment the three mutineers were
over the side and running as fast as their alcoholic condition would
permit down the wharf

Well by George exclaimed Pearson

Captain Elisha seemed to be coming out of a dream He stood still drew
his hand across his forehead and then began to laugh

Well he stammered Well I snum IIMr Pearson I wonder what on
earth you must think of me I declare the sight of that gang set me back
about twenty years Theythey must have thought I was the new skipper
Did you hear me tell em they couldnt mutiny aboard of me Ho ho
Well I am an old idiot

Pearson stuck his fist into the palm of his other hand Ive got it
he cried I knew your name was familiar Why youre the mate that
handled the mutinous crew aboard Uncle Jims bark the _Pacer_ off
Mauritius in the typhoon when he was hurt and in the cabin Ive heard
him tell it a dozen times Well this _is_ a lucky day for me

Captain Elisha was evidently pleased So he told you that did he he
began That _was_ a time and a half I

He was interrupted Over the rail appeared a blue helmet and an instant
later a big and very pompous police officer leaped to the deck He was
followed by the wharf watchman who looked frightened

Wheres the other one of them demanded the policeman Oh its you
is it Well youre too old to be gettin drunk and fightin Come along
now peaceable and lets have no words about it

He advanced and laid a hand on the captains arm

Youre under arrest he announced Will you come along quiet

Im under arrest repeated Captain Elisha UnderMy soul and body
Why I aint done anything

Yes I know Nobodys done nothin Come on or shall IHello Mr
Pearson sir How dyou do

Pearson had stepped forward

Slattery he said youve made a mistake Let me tell you about
it He drew the officer aside and whispered in his ear After a rather
lengthy conversation the guardian of the peace turned to the watchman

What dyou mean by tellin all them lies he demanded

Lies repeated the astonished watchman I never told no lies

You did You said this gentleman indicating the nervous and
apprehensive Captain Elisha was fightin and murderin I ask your
pardon sir Twas this blokes foolishness Gwan ashore You make me
sick Good day Mr Pearson

He departed driving his new victim before him and tonguelashing him
all the way The captain drew a long breath

Say Mr Pearson he declared a minute or so ago you said this was
a lucky day for you I callate its a luckier one for me If it hadnt
been for you Id been took up Yes sir took up and carted off to the
lockup Whew that would have looked well in the papers wouldnt it
And my niece and nephew Jerushy Im mightily obliged to you How
did you handle that policeman so easily

Pearson laughed Oh he replied a newspaper training and
acquaintance has its advantages Slattery knows me and I know him

Well I thank you I do so

You neednt I wouldnt have missed meeting you and seeing you handle
those fellows for a good deal And besides youre not going to escape
so easy You must lunch with me

The captain started hastily pulled out his watch and looked at it

Quarter to one he cried And I said Id be back at that lawyers
office at halfpast twelve No no Mr Pearson I cant go to lunch
with you but I do wish youd come and see me some time My address
forfor a spell anyhowis Central Park West giving the number and
the name is Warren same as mine Will you come some evenin Id be
tickled to death to see you

The young man was evidently delighted

Will I he exclaimed Indeed I will I warn you Captain Warren that
I shall probably keep you busy spinning sea yarns

Nothin I like better though Im afraid my yarnsll be pretty dull
alongside of your Uncle Jims

Ill risk it Goodby and good luck I shall see you very soon

Thats right do So long




CHAPTER VI


The boy Captain Elishas acquaintance of the morning was out regaling
himself with crullers and milk at a pushcart on Broad Street when the
captain returned to the officers of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves The
clerk who had taken his place was very respectful

Captain Warren he said Mr Sylvester was sorry to miss you He
waited until half past twelve and left word for us to telephone if you
came Our Mr Graves is still ill and the matter of your brothers
estate must be discussed without further delay Please sit down and I
will telephone

The captain seated himself on the leathercovered bench and the clerk
entered the inner office He returned a few moments later to say

Mr Sylvester is at the Central Club He wished me to ask if you could
conveniently join him there

Captain Elisha pondered Why yes he replied slowly I spose I
could I dont know why I couldnt Where is thiserclub of his

On Fifth Avenue near Fiftysecond Street Ill send one of our boys
with you if you like

No no I can pilot myself I guess I aint so old I cant ask my
way Though with a reminiscent chuckleif the folks I ask are all
sufferin from that Ugh disease I shant make much headway

What disease asked the puzzled clerk

Oh nothin I was just thinkin out loud thats all Mr Sylvester
wants to see me right off does he

Yes he said he would wait if I phoned him you were coming

Umhm Well you can tell him Ive left the dock bound in his
direction Say that young chap that was here when I called the fust
timestudyin to be a lawyer is he

Who Tim No indeed Hes only the office boy Why did you ask

Oh I was just wonderin I had a notion he might be in trainin for a
judgeship he was so high and mighty Ho ho Hes got talent that boy
has Nobody but a born genius could have made as many mistakes in one
name as he did when he undertook to spell Elisha Well sir Im much
obliged to you Good day

The Central Club is a ponderous institution occupying a becomingly
gorgeous building on the Avenue The captain found his way to its door
without much trouble A brassbuttoned attendant answered his ring and
superciliously inquired his business Captain Elisha not being greatly
in awe of either buttons or brief authority calmly hailed the attendant
as Genral and informed him that he was there to see Mr Sylvester if
the latter was on deck anywheres

Tell him its Capn Warren Major he added cheerfully hes
expectin me

The attendant brusquely ushered the visitor into a leatherupholstered
reception room and left him The captain amused himself by looking at
the prints and framed letters and autographs on the walls Then a round
red pleasantfaced man entered

Pardon me he said is this Captain Warren

Yes sir was the reply Thats my name This is Mr Sylvester aint
it Glad to know you sir

Thanks Sorry to have made you travel way up here Captain I waited
until twelvethirty but as you didnt come then I gave you up Hope I
havent inconvenienced you

No no Not a mite Might just as well be here as anywhere Dont think
another thing about it

Have you lunched Captain Warren

No come to think of it I aint Ive been kind of busy this forenoon
and a little thing like dinnerluncheon I meanslipped my mind
Though taint often I have those slips Im free to say Ho ho
Abbieshes my second cousin my housekeepersays Im an unsartin
critter but theres two things about me she can always count on ones
that my clothes have always got a button loose somewheres and tothers
my appetite

He laughed and Sylvester laughed with him

Well observed the lawyer Im not sure that I couldnt qualify on
both of those counts At any rate Im sure of my appetite I had a lunch
engagement with an acquaintance of mine but he hasnt appeared so you
must take his place Well lunch together

Well now Id like to fustrate and its real kind of you Mr
Sylvester but I dont knows Id better Your friend may heave in
sight after all and Id be in the way

Not a bit of it And I said acquaintance not friend Of course you
will You must We can talk business while were eating if you like

All right And Im ever so much obliged to you Is there an eatin
house near here

Oh well eat right here at the club Come

He led the way and Captain Elisha followed The Central Club has a
large exclusive and wealthy membership and its quarters correspond
The captain gazed about him at the marble floors and pillars the
paintings and busts with interest After checking his hat and coat as
they entered the elevator he asked a question

Which floor is your club on Mr Sylvester he asked

Floor Why the dining room is on the fourth if thats what you mean

No I meant how many rooms do you rent

We occupy the entire building It is our own and a comparatively new
one We built it three years ago

You mean this whole shebang is just one _club_

Certainly

Hum I see Well I

What were you going to say

Nothin I was wonderin what fool thing Id ask next Im more used to
lodge rooms than I am to clubs I guess Id like to take home a picture
of this place to Theophilus Kenney Theophs been raisin hob because
the Odd Fellows built on to their buildin He said one room was enough
for any society Twould be if we was all his kind of society Theophs
so small he could keep house in a closet Hes always hollerin
in meetin about his soul I asked the minister if it didnt seem
ridiclous for Kenney to make such a big noise over such a little thing
This where we get off

The dining room was a large and ornate apartment Captain Elisha when
he first entered it seemed about to ask another question but choked
it off and remained silent Sylvester chose a table in a retired corner
and they sat down

Now Captain Warren said the host what will you eat

Captain Elisha shook his head

You do the orderin he replied dryly Ill just set and be thankful
like the hen that found the china doorknob Anything that suits you will
do me I guess

The lawyer who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying his companion gave
his orders and the waiter brought first a bit of caviar on toast If
Sylvester expected this delicacy to produce astonished comments he was
disappointed

Well well exclaimed Captain Elisha I declare you take me back a
long ways Mr Sylvester Caviar Well well Why I havent ate this
since I used to go to Cronstadt At the American consuls house there we
had it often enough Has a kind of homey taste even yet That consul was
a good feller He and I were great friends

I met him a long spell after that when I was down in Mexico he
went on Hed made money and was down on a vacation My ship was at
Acapulco and he and I used to go gunnin together after wild geese
and such Ho ho I remember there was a big pompous critter of an
Englishman there Mind you Im not talkin against the English Some of
the best men I ever met were English and Ive stood back to back with
a British mate on a Genoa wharf when half of Italy was hoppin around
makin proclamations that they was goin to swallow us alive And
somehow or nother they didnt Took with prophetic indigestion maybe

However this Englishman at Acapulco was diffrent He was so swelled
with importance that his back hollered in like Cape Cod Bay on the map
His front bent out to correspond though so I callate he averaged up
all right Well he heard about what a goodthat I was pretty lucky
when it come to shootin wild geese and Im blessed if he didnt send
me orders to get him one for a dinner he was goin to give Didnt
ask_ordered_ me to do it you understand And him nothin but a
consignee with no more control over me than the average female
Sundayschool teacher has over a class of boys Not so much because
shes supposed to have official authority and he want _And_ he
didnt invite me to the dinner

Well the next time my friend the exconsul and I went out gunnin
I told him of the Englishmans orders He was mad What are you goin
to do about it he asks Dont know yet says I well see By and
by we come in sight of one of them longlegged cranes big birds you
know standin fishin at the edge of some reeds I up with my gun and
shot it The consul chap looked at me as if I was crazy What in the
world did you kill that fishbasket on stilts for he says Son
says I your eyesight is bad Thats a BritishAmerican goose Chop off
about three feet of neck and a couple of fathom of hind legs and pick
and clean whats left and I shouldnt wonder if twould make a good
dinner for a mutual friend of oursgood _enough_ anyhow Well sir
that exconsul set plump down in the mud and laughed and laughed Ho
ho Oh dear me

Did you send it to the Englishman asked Sylvester

Oh yes I sent it And after a good while and in a roundabout way I
heard that the whole dinner party vowed twas the best wild goose
they ever ate So I aint sure just who the joke was on However Im
satisfied with my end Well there I guess you must think Im pretty
talky on short acquaintance Mr Sylvester Youll have to excuse me
that caviar set me to thinkin about old times

His host was shaking all over Go ahead Captain he cried Got any
more as good as that

But Captain Elisha merely smiled and shook his head

Dont get me started on Mexico he observed Im liable to yarn
all the rest of the afternoon Lets see we was goin to talk over my
brothers business a little mite want we

Why yes we should Now Captain Warren just how much do you know
about your late brothers affairs

Except what Mr Graves told me nothin of importance And afore we go
any further let me ask a question Do _you_ know why Bije made me his
executor and guardian and all the rest of it

I do not Graves drew his will and so of course we knew of your
existence and your appointment Your brother forbade our mentioning it
but we did not know until after his death that his own children were
unaware they had an uncle It seems strange doesnt it

It does to me _so_ strange that I cant see two lengths ahead I
callate Mr Graves told you how I felt about it

Yes That is he said you were very much surprised

Thats puttin it mild enough And did he tell you that Bije and I
hadnt seen each other or even written in eighteen years

Yes

Umhm Well when you consider _that_ can you wonder I was set all
aback And the more I think of it the foggier it gets Why Mr
Sylvester its one of them situations that are impossible that you
can prove fifty ways _cant_ happen And yet it hasit sartinly has
Now tell me Are you or your firm well acquainted with my brothers
affairs

Not well no The late Mr Warren was a closemouthed man rather
secretive in fact

Humph that bein one of the pints where he was different from his
nighest relation hey

Im not so sure Have you questioned the children

Caroline and Steve Yes Ive questioned em more than they think I
have maybe And they knowwell leavin out about the price of oil
paintins and the way to dress and that its more or less of a disgrace
to economize on twenty thousand a year their worldly knowledge aint
too extensive

Do you like them

I guess so Just now aint the fairest time to judge em You see
theyre sufferin from the joyful shock of their country relation
droppin in and

He paused and rubbed his chin His lips were smiling but his eyes were
not Sylvester noted their expression and guessed many things

They havent been disagreeable I hope he asked

Noo No I wouldnt want to say that Theyre young andand well
I aint the kind theyve been used to Carolines a nice girl She is
sure All she needs is to grow a little older and have the right kind of
advice andand friends

How about the boy Mr Sylvester had met young Warren and his eyes
twinkled as he spoke

Steve Well there was an answering twinkle in Captain Elishas eye
well Steve needs to grow too though I wouldnt presume to tell him
so When a fellers undertakin to give advice to one of the seven wise
men he has to be diplomatic as you might say

The lawyer put back his head and laughed uproariously

Ha ha he crowed Thats good Then from your questioning of the
children youve learned

Not such an awful lot I think Ive learned thathum that a good
guardian might be a handy thing to have in the house A reglar legal
guardian I mean Otherwise

Otherwise

Otherwise there might be too many disinterested volunteer substitutes
for the job Maybe Im wrong but I doubt it

Have you made up your mind to be that guardian

Not yet I havent made up my mind to anything yet Now Mr Sylvester
while were waitin for what comes nextyouve ordered enough grub
to victual a shipspose you just run over what your firm knows about
Bije That is if I aint askin too much

Not at all Thats what Im here for You have a right to know But I
warn you my information isnt worth much

He went on briefly and with the conciseness of the legal mind to tell
of A Rodgers Warren his business and his estate He had been a broker
with a seat on the Stock Exchange

That seat is worth considerble aint it interrupted the captain

Between eighty and one hundred thousand dollars

Yup Well it reminds me of a picture I saw once in one of the comic
papers An old feller from the backwoods somewheresgood deal like me
he was and just about as greenwas pictured standin along with
his city nephew in the gallery of the Exchange And the nephew says
Uncle says he do you realize that a seat down theres wuth
seventyfive thousand dollars Gosh says the old man no wonder
most of em are standin up Ho ho Is that seat of Bijes part of
the five hundred thousand you figger hes left

Yes in a way it is To be truthful Captain Warren were not sure as
to the amount of your brothers tangible assets Graves made a hurried
examination of the stocks bonds and memoranda and estimated the
total thats all

I see Well heave ahead

The lawyer went on The dead brokers office had been on Broad Street
A small office with but two clerks One of the clerks was retained
and the office having been leased for a year by its former tenant
was still open pending the settlement of the estate A Rodgers Warren
personally was a man who looked older than he really was a good liver
and popular among his companions

What sort of fellers were his companions asked Captain Elisha

You mean his friends in society or his companions downtown in Wall
Street

The Wall Street ones I guess I can find out something about the
society ones Anyhow I can try These Wall Streeters that Bije chummed
witha quiet lot was they

Sylvester hesitated Whywhynot particularly so he admitted
Nothing crooked about them of course You see a stockbrokers life
is a nerveracking rather exciting one and

And Bije and his chums were excited too hey All right you neednt
go any further He was a good husband while his wife lived want he

Yes Frankly Captain Warren so far as I know your brothers personal
habits were good There was nothing against his character

Im mighty glad to hear it Mighty glad Is there anything else you can
tell me

No Our next move provided you decide to accept the trust the
executorship and the rest is to get togetheryou and Graves if he is
well enough you and I if he is notand begin a careful examination of
the stocks bonds assets and debts of the estate This must be done
first of all

Graves hinted there want any debts to amount to anything

So far as we can see there are none except a few trifling bills

Yes yes Hum Captain Elisha put down his coffee spoon and seemed to
be thinking He shook his head

You appear to be puzzled about something observed the lawyer who was
watching him intently

I am I was puzzled afore I left home and Im just as puzzled now

What puzzles you if I may ask

Everything And if youll excuse my sayin so Mr Sylvester I guess
it puzzles you too

He returned his hosts look The latter pushed back his chair
preparatory to rising

It is all so perfectly simple on the face of it Captain Warren he
said Your brother realized that he must die that his children and
their money must be taken care of you were his nearest relative
his trust in your honesty and judgment caused him to overlook the
estrangement between you Thats the case isnt it

Yes Thats the case on the face of it as you say But youve forgot
to mention one item

Whats that

Bije himself You knew him pretty well I can see that So did I And
I guess thats why were both puzzled

Captain Elisha folded his napkin with care and stood up Sylvester rose
also

Come downstairs he said We can enjoy our cigars more comfortably
there and go on with our talk That is unless youre in a great
hurry

No I aint in any special hurry So I get up to Carolines in season
for supperer dinner I meanI dont care But I dont want to keep
you Youre a busy man

This is business This way Captain

The big lounging room of the club on the first floor Fifth Avenue
side was almost empty when they entered it The lawyer drew two big
chairs near the open fire rang the bell and ordered cigars After
the cigars were lighted and the fragrant clouds of tobacco smoke were
rising he reopened the conversation And now in an easy diplomatic
way he took his turn at questioning

It was pretty thorough pumping managed with the skill of an experienced
crossexaminer Captain Elisha without realizing that he was doing so
told of his boyhood his life at sea his home at South Denboro his
position in the village his work as selectman as member of the school
committee and as director in the bank The tone of the questioner
expressed nothinghe was too well trained for thatbut every item of
information was tabulated and appraised

The tall mahoganycased clock struck three then four The lawyer
finished his cigar and lit another He offered a fresh one to his guest
but the offer was declined

No thank you observed the captain Ive been yarnin away so
fast that my breaths been too busy to keep this one goin Theres
considerble left yet This is a better smoke than Im used to
gettin at the store down home I tell Ryderhes our storekeeper and
postmasterthat he must buy his cigars on the reel and cut em off with
the scissors When the gang of us all got agoin mail times it smells
like a ropewalk burnin down Ho ho It does for a fact Yet I kind
of enjoy one of his fivecenters after all You can get used to most
anything Maybe its the home flavor or the society Praps theyd taste
better still if they was made of seaweed Ill trouble you for a match
Mr Sylvester Two of em if you dont mind

He whittled one match to a point with his pocket knife impaled the
cigar stump upon it and relit with the other

Meanwhile the room had been filling up Around each of the big windows
overlooking the Avenue were gathered groups of men young and old
smoking chatting and gazing idly out Captain Elisha regarded them
curiously

This aint a holiday is it he asked after a while

No Why

I was just wonderin if all those fellers hadnt any work to do thats
all

Who That crowd The lawyer laughed Oh theyre doing their regular
stunt Youll find most of them here every afternoon about this time

You dont say Pay em wages for it do you

Not that I know of Some of them are brokers who come up after the
Exchange closes Others are business men active or retired Some dont
have any businessexcept what theyre doing now

I want to know Humph They remind me of the gang in the billiardroom
back home The billiardroomersthe chronic onesdont have any
business either except to keep the dust from collectin on the chairs
That and talkin about hard times These chaps dont seem to be
sufferin from hard times much

No Most of the younger set have rich fathers or have inherited money

I see They let the old man do the worryin Thats philosophy anyhow
What are they so interested in outside Parade goin by

No I imagine an unusually pretty girl passed just then

Is that so Well well Say Mr Sylvester the longer I stay in
New York the more I see that the main difference between it and South
Denboro is size The billiardroom gang acts just the same way when the
downstairs school teacher goes past Hello

What is it

That young chap by the mizzen window looks sort of familiar to me The
one that stood up to shake a dayday to whoever was passin Hum Hes
made a hit aint he I expect some unprotected females heart broke at
that signal I callate I know him

Who Which one Oh thats young Corcoran Dunn He is a ladykiller in
his own estimation How dye do Dunn

The young man turning grinning from the window caught a glimpse of the
lawyer as the latter rose to identify him He strolled over to the fire

Hello Sylvester he hailed carelessly That was a peach You should
have seen her What Why its the Admiral

How dye do Mr Dunn said Captain Elisha

Have you two met before asked Sylvester in astonishment

Yes I had the pleasure of assisting in the welcoming salute when our
seafarin friend come aboard How was that Captain Some nautical class
to that remark

Yup You done fust rate considerin how recent you shipped

Thanks Overwhelmed Im sure Then with a look of languid amusement
at the pair What is thisa meeting of the Board of Naval Affairs
Have you bought a yacht Sylvester

No The lawyers tone was sharp

Humph Well take my advice and dont Yachts are all right to have
a good time on but they cost like the devil to keep up An auto is bad
enough By the way Sylvester did you hear about my running over the
Irishman this morning

Running over repeated the captain aghast You didnt run over
nobody I hope

Well I came devilish near it Ha ha You see the old tarrier
was crossing Saint Nicholas Avenue with a big market basket full
of provisionsthe family dinner I suppose By Jove the household
appetites must be good ones It was slippery as the mischief I was
running the car and I tried to go between the fellow and the curb
It would have been a decent bit of steering if Id made it Butha
haby Jove you know I didnt I skidded The man himself managed
to hop out of the way but his foot slipped and down he went Most
ridiculous thing you ever saw And the street Pon my word it was paved
with eatables

Sylvester plainly annoyed did not reply But Captain Elishas concern
was evident

The poor critter he exclaimed What did you do

The last I saw of him he was sitting in the mud looking at the upset
I didnt linger Peters took the wheel and we beat it Lucky the cop
didnt spot the license number Might have cost me fifty Theyve had me
up for speeding twice before What are you and the Admiral discussing
Sylvester

We were discussing a business matter answered the lawyer with
significant emphasis

Business Why sure I forgot that you were Gravess partner Settling
the family affairs hey Well I wont butt in Ta ta See you later
Captain You must go for a spin in that car of mine Ill call for you
some day Ill show you something they dont do on Cape Cod Regards to
Caro and Steve

He moved off feeling that his invitation would have met with his
mothers approval She had announced that the country uncle was to be
cultivated

Captain Elishas cigar had gone out He did not attempt to relight it

Whew he whistled Well when I go for a spin as he calls it with
_him_ I callate my headll be spinnin so I wont be responsible for
my actions Whew

Sylvester looked curiously at him

So you met him before he asked

Yes He was at the rooms when I fust landed Or his mother was there
then He came a little later with Caroline and Stephen

I see

Yes Know him and his ma pretty well do you

Slightly Ive met them at mutual acquaintances homes and about
town

Pretty well fixed I spose aint they

I presume so I dont know

Um Hes a sociable young feller aint he Dont stand on any
ceremony hey Caro and Steve think a lot of him and his mother

Yes Graves has told me the Dunns were very intimate with the Warrens
In fact just before your brothers death I remember hearing a rumor
that the two families might be even closer connected

You meanerCaroline anderhim

There was such a rumor Probably nothing in it There is no engagement
I am very sure

Yes yes I see Well Mr Sylvester I must be trottin on Ill
think the whole business over for another day or so and then give you my
decision one way or the other

You cant give it now

Noo I guess Id better not However I think

Yes

Well I think I may take the job Take it on trial anyhow

Good Im glad of it

You _are_

I certainly am And Im very glad indeed to have made your
acquaintance Captain Warren Good afternoon I shall hope to see you
again soon

Captain Elisha left the Central Club in a surprised frame of mind What
surprised him was that a man of such thorough city training and habits
as the senior partner of the law firm should express pleasure at the
idea of his accepting the charge of A Rodgers Warrens heirs and
estate Mr Graves had shown no such feeling

If he had heard Sylvesters report to Kuhn at the office next day he
might have been even more surprised and pleased

Hes a brick Kuhn declared the senior partner A countryman of
course but a keen able honest man and I think a mighty good judge
of character If I was as sure of his ability to judge investments and
financial affairs I should be certain the Warren children couldnt be
in better hands And no doubt we can help him when it comes to that
Hell probably handle the girl and boy in his own way and his outside
greenness may jar them a little But itll do them good to be jarred at
their age Hes all right and I hope he accepts the whole trust

Well exclaimed Mr Kuhn you surprise me Graves seemed to be

Graves suffers from the absolute lack of a sense of humor His path
through life is about three feet wide and bordered with rockribbed
conventionality If a man has a joke in his system Graves doesnt
understand it and is suspicious I tell you Kuhn theres more honest
common sense and ability in the right hand of this DownEast salt than
there ever was in Rodgers Warrens whole body




CHAPTER VII


During the next day Caroline Warren and her brother saw little of their
uncle Not that they complained of this or sought his society The
policy of avoidance and what Stephen called freezing out had begun
and the young people kept to themselves as much as possible At
breakfast Caroline was coldly polite and her brother cold although
his politeness was not overdone However Captain Elisha did not seem to
notice He was preoccupied said but little and spent the forenoon in
writing a second letter to Miss Abigail In it he told of his experience
on board the _Empress of the Ocean_ and of the luncheon at the Central
Club But he said nothing concerning his nephew and niece further than
the statement that he was still getting acquainted and that Caroline
was a real nice looking girl

I suppose you wonder what Ive decided about taking the guardianship
he added just at the close Well Abbie Im about in the position of
Luther Sylvester when he fell off the dock at Orham The tide was out
and he went into the soft mud all under When the folks who saw him
tumble got to the edge and looked over they saw a round black thing
sticking out of the mire and judging twas Lutes head they asked him
how he felt I dont know yet sputters Lute whether Im drowned or
smothered but Im somewheres betwixt and between Thats me Abbie on
that guardian business Im still betwixt and between But before this
days over Ill be drowned or smothered and Ill let you know which
next time I write

After lunch he took a stroll in the Park and passed up and down the
paths thinking thinking Returning he found that Caroline and Stephen
had gone for an auto ride with the Dunns and would not be home for
dinner So he ate that meal in solitary state waited upon by Edwards

That evening as he sat smoking in the library the butler appeared to
announce a caller

Someone to see you sir said Edwards Heres his card sir

Eh Someone to see _me_ Guess youve made a mistake havent you
Commodore I dont know anybody whod be likely to come visitin me here
in New York Why yes Well I declare Tell him to walk right in Mr
Pearson Im glad to see you This is real neighborly

The caller was young Pearson the captains acquaintance of the previous
forenoon They shook hands heartily

Perhaps you didnt think I should accept that invitation of yours
Captain Warren observed Pearson I told you I meant it when I said
yes And calling within thirtysix hours is pretty good proof isnt
it

Suits me fustrate Im mighty glad you came Set right down Lonesome
at the boardin house was it

Pearson made a grimace Lonesome he repeated Ugh Lets talk of
something else Were you in time for your appointment yesterday noon

Why yes I was and I wasnt Say wont you have a cigar Thats
right And I spose bein as this is New York Id ought to ask you to
take somethin to lay the dust hey I aint made any inquiries myself
but I shouldnt wonder if the Commodorethe feller that let you
incould find somethin in the spare room closet or somewheres if I
ask him

The young man laughed If you mean a drink he said I dont care for
it thank you

What You aint a teetotaler are you

No not exactly But

But you can get along without it hey So can I generally do furs
that goes But _Im_ from South Denboro I thought here in New York

Oh there are many people even here in New York who are not convinced
that alcohol is a food

You dont tell me Well Im livin and learnin every day Judgin
from stories and the yarns in the Boston newspapers folks up our way
have the idea that this town is a sort of annex to the bad place All
right then we wont trouble the Commodore I notice youre lookin over
my quarters What do you think of em

Pearson had in spite of himself been glancing about the room Its
luxury and the evident signs of taste and wealth surprised him greatly

Astonish you to find me livin in a place like this hey

Why why yes it does somewhat I didnt realize you were such an
aristocrat Captain Warren If I had I might have been a little more
careful of my dress in making my first call

Dress Oh you mean youd have put on your Sunday clothes Well Im
glad you didnt You see _I_ havent got on my regimentals and if
youd been on dress parade I might have felt bashful Ho ho I dont
wonder you are surprised This is a pretty swell neighborhood aint
it

Yes it is

Theseerapartments now Bout as good as any in town are they

Pretty nearly There are few bettermuch better

I thought so You wouldnt call livin in em economizin to any
considerble extent would you

No with a laugh no _I_ shouldnt but my ideas of economy
arewell different They have to be Are you ecomomizing Captain

Captain Elisha laughed and rubbed his knee

No he chuckled _I_ aint but my nephew and niece are These are
their rooms

Oh youre visiting

No I dont knows youd call it visitin I dont know what you would
call it Im here thats about all you can say

He paused and remained silent His friend was silent also not knowing
exactly what remark to make

Hows the novel comin on asked the captain a minute later

Oh slowly Im not at all sure it will ever be finished I get
discouraged sometimes

No use in doin that What sort of a yarn is it goin to be Give me a
genral idea of the course youre tryin to steer That is if it aint
a secret

It isnt But theres mighty little worth telling When I began I
thought I had a good scheme but it seems pretty weak and dishwatery
now

Most things do while their bein done if you really care about doin
em well Heave ahead You said twas a sea yarn and Im a sort of
specialist when it comes to salt water Maybe I might prescribe just the
right tonic though taint very likely

Pearson began to outline the plot of his novel speaking slowly at
first but becoming more interested as he continued Captain Elisha
listened meditatively puffing solemnly at his cigar and interrupting
but seldom

I think thats a pretty good idea he observed at length Yes
sir that sounds promisin to me This capn of yours now hes a good
feller Dont get him too good though that wouldnt be natural And
dont get him too bad neither I know its the fashion judgin by the
sea yarns Ive read lately to have a Yankee skipper sort of a cross
between a prize fighter and a murderer Fust day out of port he begins
by pickin out the most sickly fomast hand aboard mashes him up and
then takes the next invalid I got a book about that kind of a skipper
out of our library down home a spell ago and the librarian said twas
awful popular A strong story she said and true to life Well twas
strongyou could pretty nigh smell itbut as for bein true to life
I had my doubts Ive been to sea command of a vessel for a good many
years and sometimes Id go weeks whole weeks without jumpin up and
down on a single sailor Fact Got my exercise other ways I presume
likely

I tell you he went on the main trouble with that tale of yours as
I see it is that youre talkin about things you aint ever seen Now
theres plenty you have seen I wouldnt wonder Lets see you was born
in Belfast you said Live there long did you

Yes until I went away to school

Your father he went to sea did he

Yes But his ship was lost with all hands when I was a baby

But your Uncle Jim want lost You remember him well you said so
Tell me something you remember

Before the young man was aware of it he was telling of his Uncle
Jim of the latters return from voyages of his own home life of his
mother and of the village where he spent his boyhood Then led on by
the captains questioning he continued with his years at college his
experiences as reporter and city editor Without being conscious that
he was doing so he gave his host a pretty full sketch of himself his
story and his ambitions

Mr Pearson said Captain Elisha earnestly dont you worry about
that yarn of yours If youll take the advice of an old feller who knows
absolutely nothin about such things keep on rememberin about your
Uncle Jim He was a man every inch of him and a seaman too Put lots
of him into this hero of yours and you wont go fur wrong And when it
comes to handlin a ship whywell if you _want_ to come to me Ill
try and help you out best I can

Pearson was delighted

You _will_ he cried Splendid Its mighty good of you May I spring
some of my stuff on you as I write it

Sartin you may Any time Ill be tickled to death Ill be tickled to
have you call too that is if callin on an old salt like me wont be
too tirin

The answer was emphatic and reassuring

Thank you said Captain Elisha Im much obliged Come often do
Iwell the fact is Im likely to get sort of lonesome myself Im
afraid Yes I shouldnt wonder if I did

He sighed tossed away the stump of his cigar and added

Now I want to ask you somethin You newspaper fellers are supposed to
know about all there is to know of everything under the sun Do you know
much about the Stock Exchange

Pearson smiled

All I can afford to know he said

Humph Thats a pretty good answer Knowledge is power they say
butbut I callate knowledge of the Stock Exchange is poverty with a
good many folks

I think youre right Captain Its none of my business butwere you
planning to tackle Wall Street

Captain Elisha glanced under his brows at his new friend and his eyes
twinkled

Didnt know but I might he replied solemnly Aint got
anyertips any sure things you want to put me on to have you

I have not My experience of Wall Street sure things leads me to
believe that theyre surebut only for the other fellow

Hum I know a chap down home that made money in stocks He made it so
easy that as the boys say twas almost a shame to take the money And
twas the makin of him too

Pearson was embarrassed and troubled If this bighearted simpleminded
countryman had come to New York to buck the stock market it was time
to sound a warning But had he on such short acquaintance the right to
warn The captain was shrewd in his own way Might not the warning seem
presumptuous

Sothisthis friend of yours was a successful speculator was he he
asked He was lucky

Think so Well maybe His name was Elkanah Chase and his dad was old
man Rastus Chase who made considerble in cranberries and one thing
or nother The old man brought Elkanah up to be what he called a
gentleman Ho ho Hi hum I aint sure what Rastuss idea of
a gentleman was but if he callated to have his son a tramp in
gotomeetin clothes he got his wish When the old man died he willed
the boy fifteen thousand dollars Well fifteen thousand dollars is a
fortune to some folksif they aint economizin in New Yorkbut to
Elkanah twas just about enough to make him realize his poverty So
to make it bigger he got one of them tips from a college friend down
here in Wall Street and put the heft of ten thousand into it _And_ I
swan if it didnt double his money

Captain Elishas visitor shook his head He did not even smile

He was extremely fortunate he said I give you my word Captain
Warren that the majority of first speculators dont turn out that way
I hope he was wise enough to keep his profits

The captain rubbed his chin

Jim he began Excuse me I should have said Mr Pearson but Ive
got sort of in the habit of callin folks by their first names Livin
where you know everybody so well gets you into those habits

Jim suits me I hope youll cultivate the habit

Do you Well I will Now Jim referrin to what I was goin to say
you bein a newspaper man ought to know everything but its pretty
plain you dont know Elkanah Chase Keep his profits Why when a feller
is all but convinced that he knows it all one little bit of evidence
like that speculation settles it for him conclusive Elkanah realizin
that Wall Street was his apple pie opened his mouth to swaller it at
one gulp He put his profits and every other cent he had into another
sure thing tip

And won again

No He lost all that and some more that he borrowed

But I thought you said it was the making of him

It was He had to take a job over at the overalls factory in Ostable
As a fifteen thousand dollar gentleman he was pretty average of a mess
but they tell me he makes middlin good overalls Elkanah convinced me
that Wall Street has its good points

He chuckled Pearson relieved laughed in sympathy Has he paid back
the money he borrowed he inquired

Noo I guess the creditorsll have to take it out in overalls
However its a satisfaction to some of em to watch Chase really work
I know that gives me _my_ moneys worth

Oh ho You are one of the creditors Captain Warren Im surprised I
sized you up as a shrewder judge of investments

Captain Elisha colored I judged that one correct he answered If
I hadnt thought twould have turned out that way I never would have
plunged You see old man Chase was a friend of mine andHowever he
added hastily changing the subject weve strayed some off the course
When I mentioned the Stock Exchange I did it because my brother was a
member of it and I callate you might have known him

Pearson was astonished Your brother was a member of the Exchange he
repeated

Umhm Never would have guessed it would you I spose you callate
all the stock I knew about was on the hoof Well I have been acquainted
with other breeds in my time My brothers name was Abijah WarrenA
Rodgers Warren he called himself

The effect of this announcement was instantaneous and electric The
young man sat back in his chair

A Rodgers Warren was your brother he cried

Umhm Seems to stagger you some Contrast between us as big as all
that comes to

Butbut Captain WarrenYour brotherTell me is Miss Caroline
Warren your niece

She is And Steve is my nephew Taint possible youre acquainted with
them

Pearson rose to his feet IsThey used to live on the Avenue he
said But you said you were visiting Captain Warren is this your
nieces apartment

Yes hers and Steves Why whats the matter Aint goin are you

I think perhaps I had better It is getting late

Late Its only the shank of the evenin Jim I aint so blind that I
cant see through an open window It aint the lateness that makes you
want to leave so sudden Is there some trouble between you and Caroline
Course its none of my business and you neednt tell me unless you
want to

The answer was prompt enough

No replied Pearson No I assure you there is nothing of that kind
II met Miss Warren In fact at one time we were well acquainted I
have the very highest opinion of her But I think it is best to

Just a minute now No trouble with Steve Hes a boy and at an age when
hes pretty well satisfied with himself and you have to make allowance

No Steve and I were quite friendly Im sorry to cut my visit short
but it is late and I _must_ go

He was moving toward the door Captain Elisha looked at him intently

Well if you must he said But I hope youll come again soon Will
you

I hope I may I give you my word Captain that I appreciate your
invitation and I do want to know you better

Same here I dont often take sudden fancies Jim but I knew your
uncle and Id bet considerble on any member of his family And I _was_
kind of interested in that novel of yours You havent said youd come
again Will you

Pearson was much embarrassed

I should like to come immensely he said with an earnestness
unmistakable butbut to be honest Captain Warren there is a
reason one which I may tell you sometime but cant nowneither Miss
Warren nor her brother have any part in itwhich makes me reluctant to
visit you here Wont you come and see me at the boarding house Heres
the address _Will_ you come

Sartin I figured on doin it if you gave me the chance

Thank you youll be welcome Of course it is _only_ a boarding house
and not a very good one My own room iswell different from this

Yup Maybe thats why I expect to feel at home in it Good night Jim
Thank you for callin Shall I ring for the Commodore to pilot you out

No I can find my way ISomeone is coming

From the hall came the clang of the elevator door and the sound of
voices Before the captain or his friend could move Caroline Stephen
Mrs Corcoran Dunn and Malcolm entered Caroline was the first to reach
the library Her entrance brought her face to face with Pearson

I beg your pardon she began I did not know there was anyone here

Its only a friend of mine Caroline explained her uncle quickly
Just callin on me he was

Good evening Miss Warren said Pearson quietly

The girl looked at him for an instant Then her expression changed and
with a smile she extended her hand

Why Mr Pearson she exclaimed Im very glad to see you You must
excuse me for not recognizing you at once Steve you remember Mr
Pearson

Stephen also extended a hand

Sure he said Glad to see you again Pearson Havent met you for an
age How are you

Pearson shook both the hands He was embarrassed and hesitated in his
reply

It _has_ been some time since we met he said This is an unexpected
pleasure Ah Mr Dunn good evening

It is Mr Pearson the financial writer of the _Planet_ Malcolm
said Caroline You used to know him I think

Dont remember Im sure Yes I do Met you at the University Club
didnt I

Yes I was formerly a member

And let me present you to Mrs Corcoran Dunn went on the girl Mr
Pearson used to know father well

Mrs Dunn inspected the visitor through her lorgnette and condescended
to admit that she was delighted

Im very glad you called continued Caroline We were just in time
werent we Do sit down And if you will wait a minute until we remove
our wrapsSteve ring for Edwards please

Im afraid I cant wait Miss Warren I dropped in to see your uncle
at his invitation and as a matter of fact I didnt know

To see our _uncle_ interrupted Stephen in amazement Who

Your uncle Captain Warren here explained Pearson surprised in his
turn He and I made each others acquaintance yesterday and he asked
me to call

Youyou called to see _him_ repeated Stephen Why what in the
world

I took the liberty of askin him Caroline observed Captain Elisha
quietly and ignoring the last speaker I didnt know you knew him
and I used to sail along with _his_ uncle so he seemed almost like own
folks

Oh Carolines manner changed I presume it was a business call she
said slowly I beg pardon for interrupting We had not seen you since
fathers death Mr Pearson and I assumed that you had called upon my
brother and me Excuse me Mrs Dunn we will go into the drawingroom

She led the way toward the apartment Captain Elisha was about to speak
Pearson however explained for him

Miss Warren he said if by a business call you mean one in the
interest of the _Planet_ I assure you that you are mistaken I am no
longer connected with any paper I met Captain Warren under rather
unusual circumstances We discovered that we had mutual friends and
mutual interests He asked me to call on him and I did so I did not
know until five minutes ago that he was your uncle or that you and
your brother lived here I beg you wont leave the room on my account I
was about to go when you came Good evening

He bowed and stepped toward the hall Captain Elisha laid a hand on his
arm and detained him

Just a minute he said Caroline I want you and Steve to know that
what Mr Pearson says is exactly true I aint the kind to talk to the
newspapers about the private affairs of my relations and if Im
any judge of character Mr Pearson knowin you as it seems he does
wouldnt be the kind to listen Thats all Now Jim if you must go

He and his guest were at the door Caroline and Mrs Dunn were at the
opposite side of the room Suddenly the girl halted turned and moving
across to where her uncle and the young man were standing once more
extended her hand

Mr Pearson she said impulsively again I ask your pardon I should
have known I am very sorry I spoke as I did Will you forgive me

Pearson colored His embarrassment was more evident than before

There is no occasion for apology Miss Warren he said I dont
wonder you thought I had come in my former capacity as reporter

Yes you do You _must_ have wondered I am very glad you called to see
mymy guardian and I hope you will continue to do so Father used to
speak so highly of you and Im sure he valued your friendship Stephen
and I wish to consider his friends ours Please believe that you are
welcome here at any time

Pearsons reply was brief

Thank you Miss Warren he said You are very kind Good evening

In the hall as they waited for the elevator Captain Elisha happier
than at any time since his arrival in New York clapped his friend on
the shoulder

Jim he said I was beginnin to doubt my judgment of things and
folks Now I feel better That niece of mine has got the right stuff in
her After _that_ invitation you will come and see us once in a while
That makes it easier hey

Pearson shook his head Im not sure Captain he observed slowly
that it doesnt make it harder I shall look for you at the boarding
house very soon Dont disappoint me Good night

The captains last remark that evening was made to Edwards whom he met
just outside the door of his bedroom

Commodore he said a barn full of rats is a nuisance aint it

Sir stammered the astonished butler

I say a barn full of rats is a nuisance

Whywhy yes sir I should think it might be sir

Yup Well I know a worse one Its a house full of mysteries By by
Son Pleasant dreams

He sat up until late meditating profoundly Then taking from its
envelope the letter yet unsealed which he had written to Miss Abigail
Baker he added this postscript

 Eleven oclock I have decided Abbie to accept the
 guardianship and the rest of it for a spell anyhow Shall
 notify the lawyers in the morning Necessity is one thing
 and pleasure is another I doubt if I find the job pleasant
 but I guess it is necessary Anyhow it looks that way to
 me




CHAPTER VIII


Announcement of Captain Elishas decision followed quickly Sylvester
Kuhn and Graves received the telephone message stating it and
the senior partner was unqualifiedly delighted Kuhn accepted his
associates opinion with some reservation It is an odd piece of
business the whole of it he declared I shall be curious to see how
it works out As for Mr Graves when the information was conveyed
to him by messenger he expressed disgust and dismay Ridiculous he
said Doctor I simply must be up and about within the next few days
It is necessary that a sane conservative man be at the office Far
be it from me to say a word against Sylvester as a lawyer but he is
subject to impressions I imagine this Cape Codder made him laugh and
therefore in his opinion is all right Im glad Im not a joker

The captain said that he would be down later on to talk things over
Meanwhile if the papers and such could be gotten together it would
sort of help along Sylvester explained that there were certain legal
and formal ceremonies pertaining to the acceptance of the trust to be
gone through with and these must have precedence All right answered
the captain Lets have em all out at once and get the ache and agony
over Ill see you by and by

When Mrs Corcoran Dunn made her daily visit to the Warren apartment
that afternoon she found Caroline alone and almost in tears Captain
Elisha had broken the news at the table during luncheon after which
he went downtown Stephen having raved protested and made himself
generally disagreeable and his sister correspondingly miserable had
departed for the club It was a time for confidences and the wily Mrs
Dunn realized that fact She soothed comforted and within half an
hour had learned the whole story Caroline told her all the strange
will the disclosure concerning the country uncle and the inexplicable
clauses begging the latter to accept the executorship the trust and
the charge of her brother and herself Incidentally she mentioned that
a possible five hundred thousand was the extreme limit of the familys
pecuniary resources

Now you know everything sobbed Caroline Oh Mrs Dunn _you_ wont
desert us will you

The widows reply was a triumph of its kind In it were expressed
sorrow indignation pity and unswerving loyalty Desert them Desert
the young people toward whom she had come to feel almost like a mother
Never

You may depend on Malcolm and me my dear she declared We are not
fairweather friends And after all it is not so very bad Affairs
might be very much worse

Worse Oh Mrs Dunn how could they be Think of it Stephen and I are
dependent upon him for everything We must ask him for every penny And
whatever he says to do we _must_ do Were obliged to Just think if he
decides to take us back with him toSouth Denboro or whatever dreadful
place he comes from we shall have to goand live there

But he wont my dear He wont It will take some time to settle your
fathers affairs and the business will have to be transacted here in
New York

I know I suppose thats true But that doesnt make it any easier
If he stops here he will stay with us And what shall we do We cant
introduce him to our friends or at least to any except our best our
understanding friends like you and Malcolm

Why Im not sure He is ratherwellercountryfied but I believe
he has a good heart He is not rude or unkind or anything of that sort
is he

No Noo Hes not that at all In fact he means to be kind in his
way But its such a different way from ours He is not used to society
he wouldnt understand that certain things and ways were absolutely
essential I suppose it isnt his fault exactly but that doesnt help
And how can we tell him

I dont know that you can tell him but you might hint Diplomacy my
dear is one of the necessary elements of life Whatever else you
do remember to be diplomatic My poor husband used to have a pet
proverbhe was interested in politics my dear and some of his sayings
were a trifle grotesque but very much to the point He used to say that
one could get rid of more flies with molasses than with a club And I
think he was right Now let me consider Lets look the situation right
in the face Of course your guardian as a companion as an associate
for us for our kind of people is to be quite frank impossible

Yes Yes Im sure he is

Yes But he _is_ your guardian Therefore we cant get rid of him
withwell with a club He must be endured and made as endurable as
possible And it certainly will not do to offend him

Steve says we must do what he calls freezing him outmake him feel
that we do not want him here

Hum Well Stephen is a nice boyMalcolm adores himbut he isnt a
diplomat If we shouldwhat is itfreeze out your uncle

Please call him something else

Well well call him the encumbrance on the estate thats legal
I believe and expresses it nicely If we should freeze out the
encumbrance we _might_ freeze him to his village and he _might_ insist
on your going with him which wouldnt do at _all_ my dear For one
thing Malcolm would probably insist on going also and I for one
dont yearn for rural simplicity Ha ha Oh you mustnt mind me Im
only a doting mamma dearie and I have my air castles like everyone
else So freezing out wont do No you and Steve must be polite to our
encumbrance

I shall not get on my knees to him and beg That I shant do

No one expects you to If anyone begs it should be he Condescend to
just a little Make him feel his place Correct him when he goes too far
wrong and ignore him when he gets assertive As for getting rid of him
at times when it may be necessarywell I think you may safely leave
that to me

To you Oh Mrs Dunn we couldnt think of dragging you into it It is
bad enough that we should be disgraced but you must not be

My dear child I _think_ my position in society is sufficiently
established to warrant a risk or two If _I_ am seen in company
withwith the encumbrance people will merely say Oh its another
of her eccentricities thats all Now dont worry and dont fret all
that pretty color from your cheeks Always remember this it is but
for a year or a trifle over Then you will be of age and can send your
encumbrance to the rightabout in a hurry

Caroline under the spell of this convincing eloquence began to cheer
up She even smiled

Well she said I will try to be diplomatic I really will But
StephenIm not sure what dreadful thing _he_ will do

He will return to college soon I will take upon myself the convincing
of the encumbrance to that effect And while he is at home Malcolm will
take charge of him He will be delighted to do it

Mrs Dunn how can we ever thank you sufficiently What should we do
without you and Malcolm

I _hope_ my dear that you will never have to do without me not for
many years at any rate Of course there is always my poor heart
butwe wont worry will we

So with a kiss and an embrace this affecting interview ended

There was another that evening between Mrs Dunn and her son which was
not devoid of interest Malcolm listened to the information which his
mother gave him and commented upon it in characteristic fashion

Humph he observed two hundred and fifty thousand instead of the
two million you figured on Mater Two hundred and fifty thousand isnt
so much in these days

No replied his parent sharply it isnt so much but it isnt so
little either

I suppose one can get along on it

Yes one can In fact I know of two who are managing with a good deal
less Dont be any more of a fool than you can help Malcolm The sum
itself isnt small and besides the Warrens are a family of standing
To be connected with them is worth a good deal There are infinite
possibilities in it Oh if only I might live to see the day when
tradespeople meant something other than nuisances to be dodged I
_think_ I could die contented

Caros a decent sort of a girl commented Malcolm reflectively

Shes a bright girl and an attractive one Just now she is in a mood to
turn to us to you But for Heavens sake be careful She is delicate
and sensitive and requires managing She likes you If only you werent
such a blunderer

Much obliged Mater Youre free with your compliments this evening
Whats the trouble Another heart

No My heart I can trust up to certain limits But Im afraid of your
head just as I always was of your fathers And heres one more bit of
advice Be careful how you treat that country uncle

The Admiral Ho ho Hes a card

He may be the trump that will lose us the trick Treat him civilly
yes even cordially if you can And _dont_ insult him as you did the
first time you and he met

The young man crossed his legs and grunted in resignation

Well he said its going to be a confounded bore but at the very
longest itll last but a year Then Caro will be her own mistress

Yes But there are three hundred and sixtyfive days in a year
remember that

All right Mater You can bet on me The old hayseed and I will be
bosom pals Wait and see

The formalities at the lawyers took some time Captain Elisha was
absent from the apartment the better part of the following two days The
evenings however he spent with his niece and nephew and if at all
sensitive to sudden changes of the temperature he must have noticed
that the atmosphere of the library was less frigid Caroline was not
communicative did not make conversation nor was she in the least
familiar but she answered his questions did not leave the room when he
entered and seemed inclined to accept his society with resignation
if not with enthusiasm Even Stephen was less sarcastic and bitter At
times when his new guardian did or said something which offended his
highly cultivated sense of the proprieties he seemed inclined to burst
out with a sneer but a quick ahem or a warning glance from his
sister caused him to remain silent and vent his indignation by kicking
a footstool or barking a violent order at the unresisting Edwards
Caroline and her brother had had a heart to heart talk and as a
result the allwise young gentleman promised to make no more trouble
than he could help

Though by gad Caro he declared its only for you I do it If I
had my way the old buttin should understand exactly what I think of
him

On Thursday after luncheon as Captain Elisha sat in his own room
reading a book he had taken from the library there came a knock at the
door

Come ahead in ordered the captain Caroline entered Her uncle rose
and put down the book

Oh he exclaimed is it you Excuse me I thought twas the
CommodoreEdwards I mean If Id known you was comin callin
Caroline I shouldnt have been quite so bossy Guess Id have opened
the door for you instead of lettin you do it yourself

Thank you answered his niece I came to see you onI suppose you
might call it business At any rate it is a financial matter I shant
detain you long

Captain Elisha was a trifle disappointed

Oh he said on business was it I hopedI didnt know but youd
come just out of sociability However Im mighty glad to see you
Caroline no matter what its for Thats a real becomin dress youve
got on he added inspecting her admiringly I declare you look
prettier every time I see you You favor your pa considerble I can see
it more and more Bije had about all the good looks there was in our
family with a chuckle Set down do

The girl seated herself in a rocker and looked at him for a moment
without speaking She seemed to have something on her mind and not to
know exactly how to express it

Captain Warren she began II came to ask a favor I am obliged
to ask it because you are our she almost choked over the hated
wordour guardian and I can no longer act on my own responsibility I
wish to ask you for some money

Captain Elisha nodded gravely

I see he said Well Caroline I dont believe youll find me very
closefisted I think I told you and Steve that you was to do just as
youd been in the habit of doin Of course I _am_ your guardian now
and I shall be held responsible for whatever expense comes to the
estate Itvis quite a responsibility and I so understand it As I said
to you when I told you Id decided to take the job on trial _while_ I
have it itll be my pride to see that you or your brother dont lose
anything I intend if the Almighty spares me so long and I keep on with
the trust to turn over when my terms out at least as much to you and
Steve as your father left Thats all Excuse me for mentioning it
again Now how much do you want Is your reglar allowance too small
Remember I dont know much about such things here in New York and you
must be frank and aboveboard and tell me if you have any complaints

I have no complaints My allowance is sufficient It is the same that
father used to give me and it is all I need But this is a matter
outside my personal needs

Umhm Somethin to do with the household expenses hey

No It isis a matter ofwell of charity It may amount to several
hundred dollars

Yes yes I see Charity hey Church

No One of the maids Annie has trouble at home and I wanted to help
her

The captain nodded once more

Annie he repeated thats the rosyfaced one The Irish one

Yes Her father was seriously injured the other day and cannot work
His hip is broken and the doctors bill will be large They are very
poor and I thought perhaps She hesitated faltered and then said
haughtily Father was very sympathetic and liked to have me do such
things

Sho sho Sartin Course he did I like it too Im glad you came to
me just as you did Caroline How much do you want to start with

I dont know exactly I thought I might ask our own doctor to attend
to the case and might send them some delicacies and food

Good idea Go right ahead Caroline

Thank you I have been over to see them and they need helpthey
really do

I presume likely Howd the accident happen Anybodys fault was it

Carolines eyes snapped Indeed it was she said indignantly It
was a wet morning after a rain and the pavement was slippery Mr
Moriarty Annies father was not working that daythey were making
some repairs at the factory where he is employed I believeand he had
gone out to do the family marketing He was crossing the street when an
automobile recklessly driven so everyone says drove directly down on
him He tried to jump out of the way and succeededotherwise he might
have been killed but he fell and broke his hip He is an old man and
the case is serious

Dear dear you dont tell me Poor old chap The auto fellerdid he
help Seems to me he ought to be the one to be spendin the money Twas
his fault

Help Indeed he didnt He and the man with him merely laughed as
if it was a good joke put on speed and disappeared as quickly as
possible

Why the mean swab Did this Mr Moriarty or the folks around get the
license number of the auto

No All they know is that it was a big yellow car with two men in it

Hey A yellow car

Yes Somewhat similar to the one MalcolmMr Dunn drives

So so Hum Where did it happen

On Saint Nicholas Avenue near One Hundred and TwentyEighth Street

Eh Saint Nicholas Avenue you say

Yes Caroline rose and turned to go Thank you Captain Warren she
said I will tell Doctor Henry to take the case at once

The captain did not answer immediately With his chin in his hand he was
gazing at the floor

Good afternoon said Caroline

Her uncle looked up

ErWait just a minute Caroline he said I guess maybe if you
dont mind Id like to think this over a little afore you go too far
You have your doctor go right ahead and see to the old man and you
order the things to eat and whatevers necessary But afore you give
Annie or her father any money Id kind of like to figger a little
mite

His niece stopped short turned and stared at him

Oh she said slowly and icily I see Please dont trouble yourself
I should have known However my allowance is my own and I presume I am
permitted to do what I please with that

Caroline dont be hasty I aint sayin no about the money Far from
it I only

I understandthoroughly Dont trouble to figure as you call it
Oh _Why_ did I humiliate myself I should have known

Caroline please

But the girl had gone closing the door after her Captain Elisha shook
his head heaved a deep sigh and then sinking back into his chair
relapsed into meditation Soon afterward he put on his hat and coat and
went out

Half an hour later he entered the office of a firm of commission brokers
on lower Broad Street and inquired if a gentleman by the name of Mr
Malcolm Dunn was connected with that establishment On being answered in
the affirmative he asked if Mr Dunn were in Yes he was

Well said Captain Elisha Id like to speak to him a minute or so
Just tell him my names Warren if you dont mind young feller

The clerk objected to being addressed as young feller and showed his
disapproval by the haughty and indifferent manner in which he departed
on the errand However he did so depart and returned followed by
Malcolm himself The latter who had been misled by the name into
supposing his caller to be Stephen Warren was much astonished when he
saw the captain seated outside the railing

Good afternoon said Captain Elisha rising and extending his hand
How are you today sir Pretty smart

The young man answered briefly that he was all right He added he was
glad to see his visitor a statement more polite than truthful

Well whats up he inquired condescendingly Nothing wrong with
Caro or Steve I hope

No theyre fustrate thank you

Whats doing then Is it pleasure or business

Well a little of both maybe Its always a pleasure to see you of
course and I have got a little mite of business on hand

Malcolm smiled in his languid fashion If he suspected sarcasm in
the first part of the captains reply it did not trouble him His
selfsufficiency was proof against anything of that sort

Business he repeated Well thats what Im here for Thinking of
cornering theerpotato market were you

Noo Cranberries would be more in my line and I callate you fellers
dont deal in that kind of sass I had a private matter I wanted to talk
over with you Mr Dunn that is if you aint too busy

Malcolm looked at him with an amused curiosity As he had expressed it
in the conversation with his mother this old fellow certainly was a
card He seated himself on the arm of the oak settle from which the
captain had risen and lazily swinging a polished shoe admitted that he
was always busy but never too busy to oblige

Whats on your mind Captain he drawled

Captain Elisha glanced about him somewhat uneasily

II dont know as I made it quite clear he said that it was sort
of private somethin just between us you understand

Malcolm hesitated Sliding from the settle and impatiently commanding
the clerk to open the gate in the railing he led his caller through the
main office and into a small room beyond On the glass pane of the door
was lettered Mr DunnPrivate A rolltop desk in the corner and
three chairs were the furniture Malcolm after closing the door
sprawled in the swing chair before the desk threw one leg over a
drawer which he pulled out for that purpose and motioned his companion
to occupy one of the other chairs

Captain Elisha took the offered chair and dropped his hat on the floor
beside it Then he inspected the room and its furnishings with interest
Dunn drew out a pocket case extracted a cigarette lit it and waited
for him to speak

Well observed the young man after a moment whats the trouble
Admiral Better get it off your chest hadnt you Were private enough
here

The captain answered the last question Yes he said this is nice
and private Got a stateroom all to yourself name on the door and
everything complete You must be one of the officers of the craft

Yes

Umhm I sort of expected to find your name on the door outside but
there twas Smith Haynes  Co I presume likely youre the Co

_I_ presume likely with mocking impatience What about that
private matter

Captain Elisha did not appear to hear him His eyes were fixed on
several photographs stuck in the rail of Mr Dunns desk The photos
were those of young ladies

Friends of yours inquired the captain nodding toward the
photographs

No Dunn took the photos from the rack and threw them into a pigeon
hole Look here he said pointedly I wouldnt hurry you for the
world but

He paused Captain Elisha did not take the hint His mind was evidently
still busy with the vanished photographs

Just fancy pictures I spose hey he commented

Doubtless Any other little points I can give you

I guess not I thought they was fancy looked so to me Well about
that private matter Mr Dunn I come to see you about an automobile

An automobile The young man was so astonished that he actually
removed his feet from the desk Then he burst into a laugh An
automobile he repeated Captain has the influence of the metropolis
made you a sport already Do you want to buy a car

Buy one It was Captain Elishas turn to show irritation Buy one
of them things Me I wouldnt buy one of em or run one of em for
somethin _I_ tell you No I dont want to buy one

Why not Sell you mine for a price

Not if I see you fust thank you No Mr Dunn taint that But
one of the hired help up to our placeCarolines place I meanis in
trouble on account of one of the dratted machines Theyre poor folks
of course and they need money to help em through the doctorin and
nursin and while the old mans out of work Caroline was for givin it
to em right off shes a goodhearted girl but I saidthat is I kind
of coaxed her out of it I thought Id ask some questions first

So you came to me to ask them Malcolm smiled contentedly Evidently
the cares and complications of guardianship were already proving too
intricate for the unsophisticated countryman He wished advice and
had come to him for it possibly at Carolines suggestion Affairs
were shaping themselves well Here was an opportunity to act the
disinterested friend as per maternal instructions

So you wanted to ask questions did you Captain he repeated Well
fire away Anything I can do to help you or Caroline will be a pleasure
of course Smoke

He offered the cigarette case The captain eyed it dubiously and shook
his head

No he said no thank you I commenced smokin at the butt end
I guess Begun with a pipe and them things would seem sort of
kindergarten Im afraid No offense meant you understand Its all
accordin to what youve been used to Well about the questions Heres
the first one Dont it seem to you that the right one to pay for the
doctorin and nursin and such of Mr Moriartythats Annies paought
to be the feller who hurt him That feller instead of Caroline

Sure thing If you know who did it hes your mark

He could be held responsible couldnt he

Certainly

Umhm So I thought And if he was a rightminded chap hed be glad to
help the poor critter providin he knew what damage hed done wouldnt
you think so

Malcolm nodded sagely opened his mouth to speak and then closed it
again A sudden recollection came to him an alarming recollection He
turned in his chair and looked at his visitor Captain Elisha met his
gaze frankly

Where did this accident happen asked Mr Dunn his condescending
smile absent

At the corner of Saint Nicholas Avenue and One Hundred and
TwentyEighth Street It happened last Friday mornin a week ago
And the car that hit him was a yellow one

Malcolm did not answer His pale face grew paler and then flushed a
brilliant red The captain seemed to feel sorry for him

Naturally he went on when I heard about it I remembered what you
told Mr Sylvester and me at the club that afternoon I understand how
twas of course You never thought youd done any real harm and just
went on thinkin twas a good joke much as anything If youd known
youd really hurt the poor old man youd have stopped to see him I
understand that But

Look here interrupted Dunn sharply did Caroline send you to me

Caroline No no She dont know twas your automobile at all I never
said a word to her taint likely But afore she spent any of her
money I thought youd ought to know because I was sure you wouldnt
let her Thats the way Id feel and I felt twas no moren honest to
give you the chance I come on my own hook she didnt know anything
about it

Malcolm drummed on the desk with nervous fingers The flush remained on
his face his cigarette had gone out and he threw the stump savagely
into the wastepaper basket Captain Elisha remained silent At length
the young man spoke

Well he growled pettishly how much will it take to square things
with the gang How much damages do they want

Damages Oh there wont be any claim for damages I guess That is no
lawsuit or anything of that kind The Moriartys dont know you did it
and theres no reason why they should I thought maybe Id see to em
and do whatever was necessary then you could settle with me and the
whole business would be just between us two Outside the doctors bills
and food and nursin and such all the extry will be just the old mans
wages for the time hes away from the factory Twont be very heavy

More reflection and finger tattoo by his companion Then

All right Im in it I can see that and its up to me to get out as
easy as I can I dont want any newspaper publicity Go ahead Ill pay
the freight

Captain Elisha arose and picked up his hat

Thats fustrate he said with emphasis I felt sure youd see it
just as I did Theres one thing I would like to say he added that
is that you mustnt think I was stingy about helpin em myself But it
want really my affair and when Caroline spoke of spendin her money
and Steves I didnt feel Id ought to let her You see I dont know
as you know it yet Mr Dunn but my brother Bije left me in charge of
his whole estate and now that Ive decided to take the responsibility
Ive got a sort of pride in not wastin any of his childrens
inheritance Good day Mr Dunn Im much obliged to you

He opened the office door Malcolm frowning heavily suddenly asked a
final question

Say he demanded youll not tell Caroline or Steve a word of this
mind

The captain seemed surprised

I guess you didnt catch what I said Mr Dunn he observed mildly
I told you this whole business would be just between you and me




CHAPTER IX


Captain Elisha was very far from considering himself a Solomon As he
would have said he had lived long enough with himself to know what a lot
he didnt know Nevertheless deep down in his inner consciousness he
cherished a belief in his judgment of human nature This judgment was
not of the snap variety he took his time in forming it People and
their habits their opinions and characters were to him interesting
problems He liked to study them and to reach conclusions founded upon
reason observation and common sense Having reached such a conclusion
it disturbed him when the subjects of the problem suddenly upset the
whole process of reasoning and apparently proved him wrong by behavior
exactly contrary to that which he had expected

He had been pretty well satisfied with the result of his visit to
young Dunn at the latters office Malcolm had surrendered perhaps
not gracefully or unconditionally but he had surrendered and the
conditionsecrecywas one which the captain himself had suggested
Captain Elishas mental attitude toward the son of the late Tammany
leader had been a sort of goodnatured but alert tolerance He judged
the young man to be a product of rearing and environment He had known
spoiled youths at the Cape and in their surroundings they behaved much
as Malcolm did in his The same disrespect to their elders the same
cocksureness and the same careless indifference concerning the effect
which their actions might have upon other peoplethese were natural and
nothing but years and the hard knocks of experience could bring about a
change Elkanah Chase country swell and pampered heir to the cranberry
growers few thousands and Malcolm Dunn idol of his set at the
Metropolitan Club were not so very different except in externals The
similarity confirmed his opinion that New York was merely South Denboro
many thousand times magnified

He knew how young Chase had behaved after an interview not unlike that
just described In Elkanahs case several broken windows and property
destroyed on a revel the night before the Fourth had caused the trouble
In Malcolms it was an automobile Both had listened to reason and had
knuckled under rather than face possible lawsuits and certain publicity
Chase however had sulkily refused to speak to him for a month and
regained affability merely because he wished to borrow money According
to the captains deduction Dunn should have acted in similar fashion
But he didnt that was the odd part of it

For Malcolm when he next called in company with his mother at the
Warren apartment was not in the least sulky Neither was he over
effusive which would have argued fear and a desire to conciliate
Possibly there was a bit more respect in his greeting of the new
guardian and a trifle less condescension but not much He still hailed
Captain Elisha as Admiral and was as mockingly careless as ever in
his remarks concerning the latters newness in the big city In fact he
was so little changed that the captain was perplexed A chap who could
take a licking when he deserved it and not hold malice must have good
in him unless of course he was hiding the malice for a purpose And
if that purpose was the wish to appear friendly then the manner of
hiding it proved Malcolm Dunn to possess more brains than Captain Elisha
had given him credit for

One thing seemed sure the Dunns were not openly hostile And Caroline
was Since the interview in the library when the girl had as she
considered it humiliated herself by asking her guardian for money to
help the Moriartys she had scarcely spoken to him Stephen taking his
cue from his sister was morose and silent also Captain Elisha found
it hard to forgive his dead brother for bringing all this trouble upon
him

His lawyers so Sylvester informed him were setting about getting
Rodgers Warrens tangible assets together The task was likely to be a
long one The late brokers affairs were in a muddled state the books
were anything but clear some of the investments were foreign and at
the very earliest months must elapse before the executor and trustee
could know for certain just how large a property he was in charge of

He found some solace and forgetfulness of the unpleasant life he was
leading in helping the stricken Moriarty family Annie the maid at the
apartment he swore to secrecy She must not tell Miss Caroline of his
visits to her parents home Doctor Henry also though he could not
understand why promised silence Caroline herself had engaged his
services in the case and he was faithful But the patient was more
seriously hurt than at first appeared and consultations with a
specialist were necessary

Goin to be a pretty expensive job aint it Doctor asked the
captain of the physician

Rather Im afraid

All right If expense is necessary dont be afraid of it You do just
what youd ought to and send the bill to me

But Miss Warren insisted upon my sending it to her She said it was a
private matter and one with which you as her guardian had nothing to
do

I know Caroline intends to use her own allowance I spose Well
let her think she will if twill please her But when it comes to
the settlement call on me Give her any reason you want to say
aerwealthy friend of the family come to life all at once and
couldnt sleep nights unless he paid the costs

But there isnt any such friend is there Captain Warren Other than
yourself I mean

Captain Elisha grinned in appreciation of a private joke There is
somebody else he admitted wholl pay a share anyhow I dont
knows hes what you call a bosom friend and as for his sleepin
nightswell I never heard he couldnt do that after he went to bed
But anyhow you saw wood or bones or whatever you have to do and
leave the rest to me And dont tell Caroline or anybody else a word

The Moriartys lived in a fourroom flat on the East Side uptown and
his visits there gave the captain a glimpse of another sort of New
York life as different from that of Central Park West as could well be
imagined The old man Patrick his wife Margaret the unmarried son
Dennis who worked in the gas house and five other children of various
ages were hived somehow in those four small rooms and Captain Elisha
marveled greatly thereat

For the land sakes maam he asked of the nurse how do they do it
Where do they put em nights Thatthat closet in theres the pantry
and woodshed and kitchen and dinin room and that ones the settin
room and parlor and them two drygoods boxes with doors to em are
bedrooms Theres eight livin critters to stow away when its time to
turn in and one whole beds took up by the patient _Where_ do they
put the rest Hang em up on nails

The nurse laughed Goodness knows she said He should have been
taken to the hospital In fact the doctor and I at first insisted upon
his removal there He would have been much better off But neither he
nor his wife would hear of it She said he would die sure without his
home comforts

Humph I should think more likely hed die with em or under em I
watch that fleshy wife of his with fear and tremblin Every time she
goes nigh the bed I expect her to trip over a young one and fall And if
she fell on that poor rackobones with a wave of the hand toward the
invalid twould be the final smashlike a brick chimney fallin on a
lath hencoop

At that moment the brick chimney herself entered the rooms and the
nurse accosted her

Captain Warren here she said was asking where you all found
sleeping quarters

Mrs Moriarty smiled broadly Sure tis aisy she explained When
the ould man is laid up were all happy to be a bit uncomfortable Not
that we are neither You see sor me and Nora and Rosy sleep in the
other bed and Dinnie has a bit of a shakedown in the parlor and Honora
is in the kitchen and

There there Captain Elisha interrupted hastily dont tell me any
more Id rather _guess_ that the baby bunks in the cookstove oven than
know it for sartin How did the grapes I sent you go turning to the
sick man

Aw sor they were foine God bless you sor Mary be kind to you sor
Sure the angelsll watch over you every day you live and breathe

Captain Elisha bolted for the parlor the sufferer firing a gatling
fusillade of blessings after him Mrs Moriarty continued the
bombardment as she escorted him to the door of the flat

There there protested the captain Just belay cut it short
theres a good woman Ill admit Im a saint and would wear a halo
instead of a hat if twant so unfashionable Good day If you need
anything you aint got tell the nurse

The grateful Irish woman did not intend to let him escape so easily

Aw sor she went on its all right for you to make fun Im the
jokin kind sor meself Whin the flats where we used to be got afire
and Pat had to lug me down the fire escape in his arms they tell me
I was laughin fit to kill that is when I wasnt screechin for fear
hed drop me And him poor soul never seein the joke but puffin and
groanin that his back was in two pieces Ha ha Oh dear And him
in two pieces now for sure and all Aw sor its all right for you to
laugh it off but what would we do without you You and Miss Caroline
God bless her

Caroline She doesnt come here does she

Indade she does Sure shes the perfect little lady Hardly a day
passesor a week anyhowthat she doesnt drop in to see how the ould
mans gettin on

Humph Well see that you dont tell her about me

Mrs Moriarty held up both hands in righteous protestation _She_ tell
Might the tongue of her wither between her teeth before it let slip a
word and so on Captain Elisha waved her to silence

All right all right he exclaimed So long Take good care of your
husband and andfor Heavens sake walk careful and dont step on any
of the children

Mrs Moriartys tongue did not wither at all events it was lively
enough when he next met her The captains secret was not divulged and
he continued his visits to the flat taking care however to ascertain
his nieces whereabouts beforehand It was not altogether a desire to
avoid making his charitable deeds public which influenced him He had a
habit of not letting his right hand know what his left was about in
such cases and he detested a Pharisaical philanthropist But there
was another reason why Caroline must not learn of his interest in the
Moriartys If she did learn it she would believe him to be helping them
on his own responsibility or if not that he was using money belonging
to the estate Of course he would and honestly must deny the latter
charge and therefore the first would to her mind be proven He
intended that Malcolm Dunn should pay the larger share of the bills as
was right and proper But he could not tell Caroline that because she
must not know of the young mans responsibility for the accident He
could not give Malcolm the credit and he felt that he ought not to take
it himself It was a delicate situation

He was lonely and the days seemed long Reading the paper walking in
the park occasionally dropping in at the lawyers offices or visiting
the shops and other places of interest about town made up the monotonous
routine He breakfasted early waited upon by Edwards got lunch at the
restaurant nearest to wherever he happened to be at noon and returned
to the apartment for dinner His niece and nephew dined with him but
when he attempted conversation they answered in monosyllables or not at
all Every evening he wrote a letter to Abbie and the mail each morning
brought him one from her The Dunns came frequently and seemed disposed
to be friendly but he kept out of their way as much as possible

Pearson he had not seen since the latters call This was a
disappointment for he fancied the young fellow and believed he should
like him even better on closer acquaintance He would have returned the
visit but somehow or other the card with the boardinghouse street and
number had been lost or mislaid and the long list of James Pearsons
in the directory discouraged him He speculated much concerning
the mystery at which the wouldbe novelist hinted as preventing his
accepting Carolines invitation Evidently Pearson had once known
Rodgers Warren well and had been esteemed and respected by the latter
Caroline too had known him and was frankly pleased to meet him again
Whatever the trouble might be she evidently was ignorant of it The
captain wondered and pondered but reached no satisfactory conclusion
It seemed the irony of fate that the one congenial personSylvester
exceptedwhom he had met during his stay in the big city should be
scratched from his small list of acquaintances

With Sylvester he held many familiar and enjoyable chats The
goodnatured democratic senior member of the law firm liked to have
Captain Elisha drop in for advice or to spin yarns Graves who was
well again regarded the new guardian with respect of a kind but with
distinct disapproval The captain was in his opinion altogether too
flippant and jolly There was nothing humorous in the situation as
Graves saw it and to laugh when ones brothers estate is in a tangle
indicated unfitness if nothing worse Kuhn was a sharp quickmoving
man who had no time for frivolity if it delayed business

It was after a long interview with Sylvester that Captain Elisha decided
to send Stephen back to college When he broke the news there was
rebellion brief but lively Stephen had no desire to continue his
studies he wished to become a stock broker at once and as soon as he
was of age take his fathers seat on the Exchange

Stevie said Captain Elisha one of these days when you get to be
as old as I am or before youll realize that an education is worth
somethin

Ugh grunted the boy in supreme disgust What do you know about
that

Why not much maybe but enough

Yes sarcastically What college did you attend

Me Why none mores the pity What learnin there was in our family
your dad had Maybe thats why he was what he was so fur as money and
position and society and so on went and Im what _I_ am

Oh rubbish What difference does it make to Malcolm Dunnnowhis
going through college

Well he went didnt he

Stephen grinned Malcolm had told him some particulars concerning his
university career and its termination

He wentpart way he answered

Yaas Well youve gone part way so fur And now youll go the rest

Id like to know why

For one reason because Im your guardian and I say so

Stephen was furiously angry His fathers indulgence and his sisters
tolerance had in most cases made his will law in the household To be
ordered about in this way by an ignorant interloper as he considered
his uncle was too much

By gad he shouted well see

No weve seen You run along now and pack your trunk And take
my advice and study hard Youll be behindhand in your work so Mr
Sylvester tells me but youre smart and you can catch up Make us
proud of you thats what you can do

His nephew glanced at him Captain Elisha was smiling kindly but there
was no sign of change of purpose in his look

Stephen ground his teeth

Oh he snarled if it wasnt for the disgrace If things werent as
they are Id

Sssh I know but they are Maybe I wish they want most as much
as you do but they are I dont blame you for feelin mad now but Im
right and I know it And some day youll know it and thank me

When I do Ill be insane

No youll be older thats all Now pack your trunkor get the
Commodore to pack it for you

     

News from the Moriarty sick room continued favorable for a time Then
with alarming suddenness a change came The broken hip was mending
slowly but poor Pats age was against him and the shock and long
illness were too much for his system to fight Dr Henry shook his
head dubiously when the captain asked questions And one morning at
breakfast Edwards informed him that the old man was dead Annie had
been summoned by telephone at midnight and had gone home

Captain Elisha though not greatly surprised was shocked and grieved
It seemed such a needless tragedy almost like murder although there
was no malice in it And the thought of the fatherless children and the
poverty of the stricken family made him shudder Death at any time amid
any surroundings is terrible when the dead hands have earned the bread
for many mouths it is appalling

The captain dreaded visiting the flat but because he felt it to be a
duty he went immediately And the misery and wailing and dismay he found
there were worse than his anticipations He did his best to comfort and
cheer Mrs Moriarty alternately called upon the saints to bless him and
begged to know what she would do now that they were all sure to starve
Luckily the family priest a kindhearted quiet man who faced similar
scenes almost every day of his life was there and Captain Elisha had a
long talk with him With Dennis the oldest son and Annie the maid
at the Warrens he also consulted Money for their immediate needs
he told them he would provide And the funeral expenses must not
worry them Afterwardwell plans for the future could be discussed at
another time But upon Dennis and Annie he tried to impress a sense of
their responsibility

Its up to you Boy he said to the former Annies jobs sure I
guess as long as she wants it and she can give her mother somethin
every month But youre the man of the house now and youve got to
steer the ship and keep it afloat That means work and hard work
lots of it too You can do it if youve got the grit If I can find
a better place and more pay for you I will but you mustnt depend on
that Its up to you I tell you and youve got to show whats in you
If you get stuck and need advice come to me

He handed the priest a sum of money to cover immediate contingencies
and departed His letter to Abbie that afternoon was so blue that the
housekeeper felt sure he was coming down with some disease or other
He had been riding in that awful subway where the airso the papers
saidwas not fit to breathe and just as like as not hed caught
consumption His greatuncle on his mothers side died of it so it run
in the family Either he must come home or she should come to him one
or the other

But before evening his blueness had disappeared He had just returned
to his room after stepping into the hall to drop his letter in the mail
chute when his niece knocked at the door He was surprised to see her
for she had not spoken to him except in brief reply to questions since
their misunderstanding in that very room He looked at her wonderingly
not knowing what to say or what to expect but she spoke first

Captain Warren she began hurriedly the last time I came to
youthe last time I came here I came to ask a favor and youI
thought you

She was evidently embarrassed and confused Her guardian was
embarrassed also but he tried to be hospitable

Yes Caroline he said gravely I know what you mean Wont
youwont you sit down

To his surprise she accepted the invitation taking the same chair she
had taken on the occasion of their former interview But there was a
look in her eyes he had never seen there before at least not when she
was addressing him

She went on speaking hastily as though determined to head off any
questioning on his part

Captain Warren she began once more the time I came to you in this
room you were so I thought unreasonable and unkind I asked you for
money to help a poor family in trouble and you refused to give it to
me

No Caroline he interrupted I didnt refuse you only thought I
did

She held up her hand Please let me go on she begged I thought you
refused and I couldnt understand why I was hurt and angry I knew
that father never would have refused me under such circumstances and
you were his brother But since then only today I have learned that I
was wrong I have learned

She paused The captain was silent He was beginning to hope to believe
once more in his judgment of character and yet with his hope and
growing joy there was a trifle of anxiety

I have learned went on his niece that I was mistaken I cant
understand yet why you wished to wait before saying yes but I do know
that it must have been neither because you were unkind nor ungenerous
I have just come from those poor people and they have told me
everything

Captain Elisha started What did they tell you he asked quickly
Who told you

Annie and her mother They told me what you had done and were doing for
them How kind you had been all through the illness and today Oh I
know you made them promise not to tell me and you made the doctor and
nurse promise too But I knew _someone_ had helped and Annie dropped
a hint Then I suspected and now I know Those poor people

The captain who had been looking at the floor and frowning a bit
suddenly glanced up to find his nieces eyes fixed upon him and they
were filled with tears

Will you forgive me she asked rising from her chair and coming
impulsively toward him Im sorry I misjudged you and treated you so
You must be a very good man Please forgive me

He took her hand which was swallowed up in his big one His eyes were
moist also

Lord love you dearie he said theres nothin to forgive I
realized that I must have seemed like a mean stingy old scamp Yet I
didnt mean to be I only wanted to look into this thing just a little
Just as a matter of business you know And I Caroline did that
doctor tell you anything more

Any more she repeated in bewilderment He told me that you were the
kindest man he had ever seen

Yes yes Well maybe his eyesights poor What I mean is did he tell
you anything about anybody else bein in this with me

Anybody else What do you mean

Oh nothin nothin I joked with him a spell ago about a wealthy
relation of the Moriarty tribe turnin up Twas only a joke of course
And yet Caroline II think Id ought to say

He hesitated What could he say Even a hint might lead to embarrassing
questions and he had promised Dunn

What ought you to say asked his niece

Why nothin I guess Im glad you understand matters a little better
and I dont intend for the estate nor you to pay these Moriarty bills
Just get em off your mind Forget em Ill see that everythings
attended to And later on if you and me can by puttin our heads
together help those folks to earnin a better livin why we will
hey

The girl smiled up at him I think she said that you must be one
who likes to hide his light under a bushel

I guess likely a twoquart measured be plenty big enough to hide mine
There there We wont have any more misunderstandins will we Im a
pretty green vegetable and about as out of place here as a lobster in
a balloon but as I said to you and Steve once before if youll
just remember I _am_ green and sort of rough and maybe make allowances
accordin this cruise of ours may not be so unpleasant Now you
run along and get ready for dinner or the Commodorell petrify from
standin so long behind your chair

She laughed as she turned to go I should hate to have him do that
she said He would make a depressing statue I shall see you again in a
few minutes at dinner Thank youUncle

She left Captain Elisha in a curious state of mind Against his will he
had been forced to accept thanks and credit which he believed did not
rightfully belong to him It was the only thing to do and yet it seemed
almost like disloyalty to Malcolm Dunn This troubled him but the
trouble was just then a mere pinhead of blackness against the radiance
of his spirit

His brothers daughter had for the first time called him uncle




CHAPTER X


Captain Warren asked Caroline as they were seated at the breakfast
table next morning what are your plans for today

Captain Elisha put down his coffee cup and pulled his beard
reflectively Contrary to his usual desire since he came to the
apartment to live he was in no hurry to finish the meal This breakfast
and the dinner of the previous evening had been really pleasant He had
enjoyed them His niece had not called him uncle again it is true and
perhaps that was too much to be expected as yet but she was cheerful
and even familiar They talked as they ate and he had not been made to
feel that he was the deaths head at the feast The change was marked
and very welcome The bright winter sunshine streaming through the
window indicated that the conditions outside were also just what they
should be

Well he replied with a smile I dont know Caroline as Ive made
any definite plans Lets see todays Sunday aint it Last letter I
got from Abbie she sailed into me because as she said I seemed to
have been most everywheres except to meetin She figgers New Yorks a
heathen place anyhow and she callates Im gettin to be a backslider
like the rest I didnt know but I might go to church

Caroline nodded I wondered if you wouldnt like to go she said I
am going and I thought perhaps you would go with me

Her uncle had again raised his cup to his lips Now he set it down with
a suddenness which caused the statuesque Edwards to bend forward in
anticipation of a smash The captain started to speak thought better of
it and stared at his niece so intently that she colored and dropped her
eyes

I know she faltered that I havent asked you before butbut
then with the impulsiveness which was one of her characteristics and
to her guardian her great charm she looked him full in the face and
added but I hoped you would understand thatthat _I_ understood a
little better I should like to have your company very much

Captain Elisha drew a long breath

Thank you Caroline he answered I appreciate your askin me I
sartinly do And Id rather go with you than anybody else on earth
But I was callatin to hunt up some little roundthecorner chapel or
Bethel where Id feel a little bit at home I guess likely your church
is a pretty big one aint it

We attend Saint Denis It IS a large church but we have always been
connected with it Stephen and I were christened there But of course
if you had rather go somewhere else

No no I hadnt anywhere in particular to go Im a Congregationalist
to home but Abbie says Ive spread my creed so wide that it aint
moren an inch deep anywhere and she shouldnt think twould keep me
afloat I tell her Id rather navigate a broad and shallow channel
where everybody stands by to keep his neighbor off the shoals than I
would a narrow and crooked one with selfrighteousness off both beams
and perdition underneath

You see he added reflectively the way I look at it its a pretty
uncertain cruise at the best Course theres all sorts of charts and
every fleet is sartin its got the only right one But I dont know
Were afloatthat much we are sure ofbut the port we left and the
harbor were bound for theyre always out of sight in the fog astern
and ahead I know lots of folks who claim to see the harbor and see it
plain but they dont exactly agree as to what they see As for me Ive
come to the conclusion that we must steer as straight a course as we
can and when we meet a craft in distress why do our best to help
her The rest of it I guess we must leave to the Owner to the One that
launched us I Good land he exclaimed coming out of his
meditation with a start Im preachin a sermon ahead of time And
the Commodores goin to sleep over it I do believe

The butler who had been staring vacantly out of the window during the
captains soliloquy straightened at the sound of his nickname and
asked hastily Yes sir What will you have sir Captain Elisha
laughed in huge enjoyment and his niece joined him

Well she said will you go with me

Id like to fustrateif you wont be too much ashamed of me

Then its settled isnt it The service begins at a quarter to eleven
We will leave here at halfpast ten

The captain shaved with extra care that morning donned spotless linen
including a standup collarwhich he detestedbrushed his frockcoat
and his hair with great particularity and gave Edwards his shoes to
clean He would have shined them himself as he always did at home but
on a former occasion when he asked for the blackin kit the
butlers shocked and pained expression led to questions and consequent
enlightenment

He was ready by a quarter after ten but when his niece knocked at his
door she bore a message which surprised and troubled him

Mrs Dunn called she said to ask me to go to church with her I
told her I had invited you to accompany me Would you mind if she joined
us

Her guardian hesitated I guess he answered slowly it aint so
much a question of my mindin her as she mindin me Does _she_ want me
to go along

She said she should be delighted

I want to know Now Caroline dont you think Id be sort of in the
way Dont you believe shed manage to live down her disappointment if
I didnt tag on You mustnt feel that youve got to be bothered with me
because you suggested my goin you know

If I had considered it a bother I should not have invited you If you
dont wish Mrs Dunns company then you and I will go alone

Oh land sakes I wouldnt have you do that for the world All right
Ill be out in a jiffy

He gave his hair a final brush straightened his tie turned around once
more before the mirror and walked fearfully forth to meet the visitor
For him the anticipated pleasure of the forenoon had been replaced by
uneasy foreboding

But Mrs Corcoran Dunn as she rose creakingly to greet him was
extremely gracious She was gowned and furred and hatted in a manner
which caused the captain to make hasty mental estimate as to cost but
she extended a plump hand buttoned in a very tight glove and murmured
her gratification

Im so glad you are to accompany us Captain Warren she gushed It
is a charming winter morning isnt it

Captain Elisha touched the plump glove with his own big finger tips
and admitted that the morning was fustrate He was relieved from the
embarrassment of further conversation just then by Carolines appearance
in the library She too was richly dressed

Are we all ready she asked brightly Then we may as well start

Im afraid were a trifle early my dear said Mrs Dunn but we can
stroll about a bit before we go in

The captain looked at the library clock The time was a quarter to
eleven

Early he exclaimed involuntarily Why I thought Caroline said

He stopped suddenly realizing that he had spoken aloud His niece
divined his thought and laughed merrily

The service does begin now she said but no one is ever on time

Oh ejaculated her uncle and did not speak again until they were at
the door of the church Then Caroline asked him what he was thinking

Nothin much he answered gazing at the fashionably garbed throng
pouring under the carved stone arch of the entrance I was just
reorganizin my ideas thats all Ive always sort of thought a plug
hat looked lonesome Now Ive decided that Im wearin the lonesome
kind

He marched behind his niece and Mrs Dunn up the center aisle to the
Warren pew He wrote his housekeeper afterwards that he estimated
that aisle to be upwards of two mile long And my Sunday shoes had a
separate squeak for every inch he added

Once seated however and no longer so conspicuous his common sense
and Yankee independence came to his rescue He had been in much bigger
churches than this one while abroad during his seagoing years He knew
that his clothes were not fashionably cut and that to the people about
him he must appear odd and perhaps even ridiculous But he remembered
how odd certain city people appeared while summering at South Denboro
Recollections of pointed comments made by boatmen who had taken these
summer sojourners on fishing excursions came to his mind Well he
had one advantage over such people at any rate he knew when he was
ridiculous and they apparently did not

So saved from humiliation by his sense of humor he looked about him
with interest When the procession of choir boys came up the aisle
and Mrs Dunn explained in a condescending whisper what they were his
answer surprised her a trifle Yes whispered the captain in reply I
know Ive seen the choir in Saint Peters at Rome

Only once did he appear greatly astonished That was when the offering
was taken and a certain dignified magnate whose fame as a king of
finance is worldwide officiated as one of the collectors

Heavens and earth murmured Captain Elisha staring wideeyed at
the unmistakable features so often pictured and cartooned in the daily
papers CarolineCaroline am I seein things or is thatis that

That is Mr  whispered his niece He is one of the vestrymen
here

My soul still gazing after the Emperor of Wall Street _Him_ passin
the plate Well with a grim smile whoever picked him out for the job
has got judgment If _he_ cant make a body shell out nobody can

He listened to the sermon the text of which was from the Beatitudes
with outward solemnity but with a twinkle in his eye After the
benediction when Caroline asked how he enjoyed it the cause of the
twinkle became apparent

Fine he declared with enthusiasm Hes a smart preacher aint he
And he knew his congregation You might not guess they was meek perhaps
but they certainly did look as if theyd inherited the earth

He drew a breath of relief as the trio emerged into the open air He had
enjoyed the novel experience in a way but now he felt rather like one
let out of jail The quiet luncheon at home with Caroline was a pleasant
anticipation

But Mrs Corcoran Dunn smashed his anticipation at a blow She insisted
that he and his niece lunch with her

You really must you know she declared It will be delightful Just
a little family party

Captain Elisha looked distressed Thank you maam he stammered
its awful kind of you but I wouldnt feel right to go puttin you
to all that trouble Just as much obliged but IIve got a letter to
write you see

Mrs Dunn bore his refusal bravely

Very well she said but Caroline _must_ come with me I told Malcolm
I should bring her

Sure Sartin Caroline can go of course

But Caroline also declined Having misjudged her guardian in the matter
of the Moriarty family she was in a repentant mood and had marked that
day on her calendar as one of selfsacrifice

No Captain Warren she said I shall not go unless you do

Then the captain will come of course declared Mrs Dunn with
decision Im sure he will not be so selfish as to deprive meand
Malcolmof your company

So because he did not wish to appear selfish Captain Elisha admitted
that his letter might be written later in the afternoon accepted the
invitation and braced his spirit for further martyrdom

It was not as bad as he expected The Dunns occupied a small
brownstone house on Fifth Avenue somewhat oldfashioned but eminently
respectable The paintings and bronzes were as numerous as those in the
Warren apartment and if the taste shown in their selection was not that
of Rodgers Warren the connoisseur they made quite as much show and
the effect upon Captain Elisha was the same The various mortgages on
the property were not visible and the tradesmens bills were securely
locked in Mrs Dunns desk

The luncheon itself was elaborate and there was a butler whose majestic
dignity and importance made even Edwards seem plebeian by comparison

Malcolm was at home when they arrived irreproachably dressed and
languidly noneffusive as usual Captain Elisha as he often said
did not set much store by clothes but there was something about this
young man which always made him conscious that his own trousers were a
little too short or his boots too heavy or something I wouldnt
_wear_ a necktie like his he wrote Abbie after his first meeting with
Malcolm but blessed if I dont wish I could _if_ I would

Caroline in the course of conversation during the luncheon mentioned
the Moriartys and their sorrow The captain tried to head her off and
to change the subject but with little success He was uncomfortable
and kept glancing under his brows at Malcolm with whom under the
circumstances he could not help sympathizing to an extent But his
sympathy was wasted The young man did not appear in the slightest
degree nervous The memory of his recent interview with Captain Elisha
did not embarrass him outwardly at least half as much as it did the
captain He declared that old Pats death was beastly hard luck but
accidents were bound to happen It was a shame and all that If
theres anything the mater and I can do Caroline call on us of
course

Yes do Caroline concurred his mother However one must be
philosophic in such cases It is a mercy that people in their station do
not feel grief and loss as we do Providence in its wisdom has limited
their susceptibilities as it has their intelligence Dont you agree
with me Captain Warren

Sartin was the prompt reply Its always a comfort to me when I go
fishin to know that the fish aint got so much brains as I have The
hook hurts I presume likely but they aint got the sense to realize
what a mean tricks been played on em The one thats caughts dead
and them that are left are too busy hustlin for the next meal to waste
much time grievin That eases my conscience considerble

Caroline seemed to be the only one who appreciated the sarcasm in this
observation She frowned slightly Mrs Corcoran Dunn tolerantly smiled
and her son laughed aloud

Say Admiral he commented when it comes to philosophy you go some
yourself dont you

Umhm I can be as philosophical about other folks troubles as anybody
I ever see Then with an involuntary chuckle of admiration at the
young gentlemans coolness he added That is anybody I ever see afore
I come to New York

Malcolm opened his mouth to reply but closed it again The captain
noticing his change of purpose and following the direction of his look
saw Mrs Dunn shake her head in sharp disapproval He ate the remainder
of his salad in silence but he thought a good deal

And now said Mrs Dunn rising and leading the way to the
drawingroom we must all go for a motor ride Everyone rides on Sunday
afternoon she explained turning to her male guest

The distressed look returned to Captain Elishas face His niece saw it
understood and came to his rescue

I think Captain Warren prefers to be excused she said smiling He
has a prejudice against automobiles

No drawled Malcolm the irrepressible Not really Admiral Im
surprised In these days you know

It aint so much the automobiles snapped Captain Elisha irritation
getting the better of his discretion as tis the devilish fools
that

Yes Oh all right Mater

That are careless enough to get in the way of them finished the
captain with surprising presence of mind Still if Caroline wants to
go

I have it exclaimed Mrs Dunn The young people shall go and the
others remain at home Malcolm shall take you for a spin Caroline and
Captain Warren and I will stay here and wait until you return Well
have a family chat Captain wont we Because with a gay laugh in a
way we _are_ like one family you see

And somewhat to Miss Warrens surprise her uncle agreed to this
proposition He did not answer immediately but when he did it was
with heartiness

Why yes he said thats a good idea Thats fustrate You young
folks go and Mrs Dunn and Ill wait here till you come back Thats
the way of the worldyoung folks on the go and the old folks at home
by the fire hey Mrs Dunn

The lady addressed did not relish being numbered with old folks but
she smiled sweetly and said she supposed it was Malcolm telephoned to
the garage and to Edwards at the Warren apartment ordering the butler
to deliver his mistresss auto cap and cloak to the chauffeur who would
call for them A few minutes later the yellow car rolled up to the door

In the hall Mrs Dunn whispered a reassuring word to her departing
guest

Now enjoy yourself dear she whispered Have a nice ride and
dont worry about me If heif our encumbrance bores me too much I
shallwell I shall plead a headache and leave him to his own devices
Besides he isnt so _very_ dreadful is he

Caroline shook her head No she answered he is a good man I
understand him better than I did andyes I like him better too

Oh Indeed Well goodby dear Goodby

The yellow car roared as the chauffeur cranked it then moved off up
the crowded avenue Mrs Dunn watched it until it was out of sight
Her brows were drawn together and she seemed puzzled and just a bit
disconcerted However when she returned to the drawingroom her
gracious smile had returned and her bland condescension was again in
evidence

Captain Elisha had been standing by the window She begged him to be
seated He thanked her but looked dubiously at the Louis XVI chair
indicated She noticed the look

Suppose we go into the library she said It is much less formal And
there is a firefor us _old_ folks with a slight accent on the word

The library was more homelike Not as many books as at the Warrens but
a great deal of gilt in the bindings and much carving on the cases The
fire was cheery and the pair sat down before it in big easy chairs
Mrs Dunn looked intently at the glowing coals

Captain Elisha cleared his throat Mrs Dunn leaned forward expectantly
The captain coughed and sank back in his chair

Yes purred the lady You were about to say

Me Oh no I didnt say anything

Another period of silence Mrs Dunns foot tapped the rug impatiently
She wished him to begin the conversation and he would not At length
in desperation she began it herself

I suppose you find New York rather different fromerNorther

From South Denboro Yes maam

Do you like the city life

Well I dont know maam

Not as well as you do that of the country doubtless

Well you see I aint had so much of it

No of course not It does so depend upon what one is accustomed to
Now I fancy I should be perfectly desperate in your village

One corner of Captain Elishas mouth curled upward

I shouldnt be surprised he admitted

Desperately lonely I mean

Yesm I judged that was what you meant Still folks can be lonesome
in New York

Perhaps But really I dont see how With all the whirl and the crowds
and the glorious excitement The feeling that one is at the very heart
the center of everything

Yes If you belong to the machinery I spose its all right But
if youve been leanin over the rail lookin on and get pushed in
unexpected maybe you dont care so much about bein nigh the center

Then why stay there Why not get out

If youre caught in the wheels gettin outs somethin of a job

But as I understand it Captain WarrenI may be misinformed for of
course I havent been unduly curious concerning your family affairsas
_I_ understand it you were not obliged to remain among theamong
the wheels as you call them You could have gotten out quite easily
couldnt you

I presume likely I could But you see maam I had a feelin that Id
ought to stay

Mrs Dunn laughed lightly Ah me she exclaimed you felt it your
duty I suppose Oh you New England Puritans

She shook her head in playful mockery Then she added But at all
events it cannot be so very disagreeablenow I have no doubt it
waswell not comfortable for you at first Steve and Caroline were
quite impossiblereally quite furious Your sudden appearance in the
capacity of guardian was too much for them They were sure you must be
a perfect ogre Captain I had to use all my eloquence to convince them
they would not be devoured alive But nowwhat a change Why already
Caroline accepts you aswell almost like an old friend like myself
In the last few days this change in her attitude is quite marked What
_have_ you done Are you a wizard Do tell me

This appeal delivered with eloquence and most engaging play of brow and
eye should have been irresistible Unfortunately the captain did not
appear to have heard it Leaning forward his hands clasped between his
knees he was gazing into the fire And when he spoke it was as if he
were thinking aloud

I spose tis a sort of disease this duty business he mused And
most diseases aint cheerful visitations Still a feller ought not to
growl about it in public I always did hate for a man to be goin about
forever complainin of his sufferinswhether they was from duty or
rheumatiz

Mrs Dunns lips snapped shut She pressed them together impatiently
Evidently her questions and their diplomatic prelude had been
unheard and wasted However she did not intend to be sidetracked or
discouraged

One should not prate of ones duty of course she agreed Not that
you dofar from it But as I was saying our dear Caroline has

Thank you maam I hope I dont groan too loud Do you know I believe
climate has a bearin on duty same as it has on rheumatics I spose
you city folksand there was almost contempt in the wordsare sort
of Christian Science and figger its an errorhey Somethin to be
forgot

The lady resented the interruption and the contempt nettled her

Not at all she retorted We city dwellers have our duties also

Is that a fact I want to know

Certainly it is a fact tartly I have my duties and many of them

Um So Well I spose you do feel you must dress just so and live
just so and do just such and such things If you call those duties
why

I do What else are they pray

Mrs Dunn was finding it difficult to keep her temper To be catechised
in this contemptuously lofty manner by one to whom she considered
herself so immensely superior was too much She forgot the careful plan
of campaign which she had intended to follow in this interview and now
interrupted in her turn And Captain Elisha who also was something of a
strategist smiled at the fire

We do have our social duties our duties to society snapped the
widow hotly They are necessary ones Having been bornor risen toa
certain circle we recognize the responsibilities attached to it We
_are_ careful with whom we associate we have to be As for dress we
dress as others of our friends do

And maybe a little better if you can hey

If we canyes I presume with crushing ironydress in South
Denboro counts but little

You wouldnt say that if you ever went to sewin circle with a
chuckle Still compared to the folks at your meetinhouse this
morning our congregation would look like a flock of blackbirds
alongside of a cage full of Birds of Paradise But most of usthe women
folks especialdress as well as we can

As well as you can triumphantly There you see And you live as
well as you can dont you

If you mean style why we dont set as much store by it as you do

Nonsense We are obliged to be with a slight shudder at the
vulgarism _stylish_ If we should lapse if we should become shabby
and behind the fashion or live in that way people would wonder and
believe it was because we could not afford to do otherwise

Well spose they did youd know better yourselves Cant you be
independent

No Not unless you are very very rich then it might be considered an
eccentricity Independence is a costly luxury and few can afford it

But suppose you cant afford the other thing

Then we must pretend we can Oh you _dont_ understand So _much_
depends upon a proper appearance Everything depends upon itones
future ones childrens futureeverything

Humph with the same irritating smile I should think that might mean
some plannin And plans the best of em are likely to go wrong You
talk about the children in yourin what you call your circle How can
you plan what theyll do You might when they was little perhaps but
when they grow up its different

It is not It _cant_ be And if they have been properly reared and
understand their responsibilities they plan with you

Land sakes You meanwhy spose they take a notion to get married
Im an old bach of course but the average young girl or feller is
subject to that sort of ailment cordin to the records Spose one
of your circles daughters gets to keepin company with a chap whos
outside the ring A promisin nice boy enough but poor and a rank
outsider Mean to say she shant marry him if she wants to

Certainly That sort of marriage is never a happy one unless of
course the girl is wealthy enough not to care And even then it is not
advisable All their customs and habits of thought are different No
Emphatically no And the girl if she is sensible and well reared as I
have said will understand it is impossible

My soul and body Then you mean to tell me that she _must_ look out for
some chap in her crowd If she aint got but just enough to keep inside
the circlethis grand whirlamagig youre tellin me aboutif shes
pretendin up to the limit of her income or over then its her duty
and her ma and pas duty to set her cap for a man whos nigher the
center pole in the tent and go right after him Do you tell me that
Thats a note I must say

Mrs Dunns foot beat a lively tattoo on the rug I dont know what you
mean by a note she commented with majestic indignation I have
not lived in South Denboro and perhaps my understanding of English
is defective But marriages among cultivated people _society_ people
intelligent ambitious people are or should be the result of thought
and planning Others are impossible

How about this thing we read so much about in novelsLove I believe
they call it

Love Love is well enough but it does not of itself pay for proper
clothes or a proper establishment or seats at the opera or any of
the practical necessary things of modern life You cant keep up a
presentable appearance on _love_ If I had a daughter who lacked the
brains to understand what I had taught her that is her duty as a
member of good society and talked of making a love match I would
But there You cant understand I suppose

She rose and shook the wrinkles from her gown Captain Elisha
straightened in his chair Why yes maam he drawled quietly yes
maam I guess I understand fustrate

And suddenly Mrs Dunn also understood Her face which had grown almost
too red for one attached to a member of polite society grew redder
still She turned away and walked to the window

What nonsense weve been talking she said after a moments silence
I dont see what led us into this silly discussion Malcolm and your
niece must be having a delightful ride I almost wish I had gone with
them

She did wish it devoutly Captain Elisha still remained by the fire

Automobiles are great things for hustlin around in he observed
Pity theyre such dangerous playthings Yet I spose theyre one of the
necessities of uptodate folks same as you said Mrs Dunn

Surely she asked coldly you dont condemn automobiles Captain
Warren What would youreturn to stage coaches

Not a mite But I was thinkin of that poor Moriarty man

His death was due to an accident And accidents she turned and looked
directly at him when they involve financial damages may be paid for

The captain nodded Yes he said

And when arrangements for such payment is made _honorable_ peopleat
least in the circle of which you and I have been speakingconsider the
matter settled and do not refer to it again either among themselvesor
elsewhere

Yes maam He nodded again She did know Malcolm evidently had
told her Yes maam Thats the way any decent person would feeland
actif such a thing happenedeven if they hailed from South Denboro

He pushed back his chair and stood up She continued to look him over
much as if she were taking a mental inventory of his character or
revising an old one

I hope she said lightly but with deliberation our little argument
anderslight disagreement concerningerduty will not make us
enemies Captain Warren

Enemies Land sakes no I respect anybodys havin opinions and not
bein afraid to give em And I think I can understand some of how you
feel Maybe if I was anchored here on Fifth Avenue same as you are
instead of bein blown in by an unexpected notheaster Id be feelin
the same way Its all accordin as Ive said so often Enemies No
indeed

She laughed again Im so glad she said Malcolm declares hed
be quite afraid of meas an enemy He seems to think I possess
some mysterious and quite diabolical talent for making my unfriends
uncomfortable and declares he would compromise rather than fight me
at any time Of course its ridiculousjust one of his jokesand Im
really harmless and very much afraid Thats why I want you and me to be
friends Captain Warren

Sure Captain Elisha nodded emphatically Thats what I want too

But that evening immediately after his return to the apartment
whenCaroline having gone to her own room to remove her wrapshe and
the butler were alone he characteristically unburdened his mind

Mr Warren sir said Edwards a young gentleman left a note here for
you this afternoon The elevator man gave it to me sir Its on your
dressing table sir

The captains answer had nothing whatever to do with the note He had
been thinking of other things

Commodore he said Ive got the answer

To the note Already sir I didnt know youd seen it

I aint Ive got the answer to the conundrum Its Mother

Mother sir II dont know what you mean

I do The answers Mother Sonny dont count though he may think he
does But Mothers the whole team and the dog under the wagon And
Commodore weve got to trot some if we want to keep ahead of that team
Dont you forget it

He went to his room leaving the bewildered butler to retire to the
kitchen where he informed the cook that the old man was off his head
worse than common tonight

Blessed if he dont think hes a trotting horse said Edwards




CHAPTER XI


The note on the dining room table proved to the captains delight to
be from James Pearson It was brief and to the point

Why dont you come and see me wrote the young man Ive been
expecting you and you promised to come Have you forgotten my address
If so here it is I expect to be in all day tomorrow

The consequence of this was that eleven oclock the next day found
Captain Elisha pulling the bell at a brick house in a long brick block
on a West Side street The block had evidently been in its time the
homes of welltodo people but now it was rather dingy and gone to
seed Across the street the first floors were for the most part small
shops and in the windows above them doctors signs alternated with
those of modistes manicure artists and milliners

The captain had come a roundabout way stopping in at the Moriarty
flat where he found Mrs Moriarty in a curious state of woe and tearful
pride Oh what will I do sir she moaned When I think hes gone
it seems as if Id die too But thanks to you and Miss WarrenMary
make it up to hermy Patll have the finest funeral since the Guinny
saloon man was buried Ah if he could have lived to see it hed have
died content

The pull at the boardinghouse bell was answered by a rather slatternly
maid who informed the visitor that she guessed Mr Pearson was in
he most always was around lunch time So Captain Elisha waited in a
typical boardinghouse parlor before a grate with no fire in it and
surrounded by walnut and plush furniture until Pearson himself came
hurrying downstairs

Say youre a brick Captain Warren he declared as they shook hands
I hoped youd come today Why havent you before

The captain explained his having mislaid the address

Oh was that it Then Im glad I reminded you Rather a cheeky thing to
do but Ive been a reporter and nerve is necessary in that profession
I began to be afraid living among the bluebloods had had its effect
and you were getting finicky as to your acquaintances

You didnt believe any such thing

Didnt I Well perhaps I didnt Come up to my room I think we can
just about squeeze in if you dont mind sitting close

Pearsons room was on the third flight at the front of the house
Through the window one saw the upper half of the buildings opposite and
above them a stretch of sky The bed was a small brass and iron affair
but the rest of the furniture was of good quality the chairs were
easy and comfortable and the walls were thickly hung with photographs
framed drawings and prints

I put those up to cover the wall paper explained the host I dont
offer them as an art collection but as a screen Sit down Put your
coat on the bed Shall I close the window I usually keep the upper
half open to let out the pipe smoke Otherwise I might not be able to
navigate without fog signals

His visitor chuckled followed directions with his coat and hat and sat
down Pearson took the chair by the small flattopped desk

How about that window he asked Shall I shut it

No no Well be warm enough I guess Youve got steam heat I see

You mean you hear Those pipes make noise enough to wake the dead At
first I thought I couldnt sleep because of the racket they made Now I
doubt if I could without it Would you consider a cigar Captain

Hum I dont usually stop to consider But I tell you Jimjust now
you said something about a pipe Ive got mine aboard but I aint dared
to smoke it since I left South Denboro If you wouldnt mind

Not a bit Tobacco in this jar on the desk I keep a temporary supply
in my jacket pocket Matches Here you are What do you think of
myerstateroom

Think it makes nice snug quarters was the prompt answer

Humph Snug is a good word Much like living in an omnibus but it
answers the purpose I furnished it myself except for the bed The
original bureau had pictures of cauliflowers painted on each drawer
front Mrs Heptonmy landladywas convinced that they were roses I
told her she might be right but at all events looking at them made
me hungry Perhaps she noticed the effect on my appetite and was willing
for me to substitute

The captain laughed Then pointing he asked Whats that handbill

The handbill was a fairsized poster announcing the production at the
Eureka Opera House of the Thrilling ComedyDrama The Golden Gods
Pearson looked at it made a face and shook his head

That he said is my combined crusher and comforter It is the
announcement of the first and next to the last performance of a play
I wrote in my calf days The Eureka Opera House isor was if the
gods werent too much for itlocated at Daybury Illinois I keep
that bill to prevent my conceit getting away with me Also when I get
discouraged over my novel it reminds me that however bad the yarn may
turn out to be I have committed worse crimes

This led to the captains asking about the novel and how it was
progressing His companion admitted having made some progress more
in the line of revision than anything else He had remodeled his hero
somewhat in accordance with his new friends suggestions during their
interview at the Warren apartment and had introduced other characters
portrait sketches from memory of persons whom he had known in his
boyhood days in the Maine town He read a few chapters aloud and
Captain Elisha waxed almost enthusiastic over them

Then followed a long discussion over a point of seamanship the handling
of a bark in a gale It developed that the young authors knowledge
of saltwater strategy was extensive and correct in the main though
somewhat theoretical That of his critic was based upon practice and
hard experience He cited this skipper and that as examples and carried
them through notheasters off Hatteras and typhoons in the Indian Ocean
The room in spite of the open window grew thick with pipe smoke and
the argument was punctuated by thumps on the desk and chair arms and
illustrated by diagrams drawn by the captains forefinger on the side
of the dresser The effects of oil on breaking rollers the use of a
seaanchor over the side to hold her to it whether or not a man
was justified in abandoning his ship under certain given circumstances
these were debated pro and con Always Pearsons Uncle Jim was held
up as the final authority the paragon of sea captains by the visitor
and while his host pretended to agree with modest reservations in
this estimate of his relative he was more and more certain that
his hero was bound to become a youthful edition of Elisha Warren
himselfand he thanked the fates which had brought this fine able
oldschool mariner to his door

At length Captain Elisha having worked Uncle Jim into a safe harbor
after a hundred mile cruise under jury jig with all hands watch and
watch at the pumps leaned forward in triumph to refill his pipe Having
done so his eyes remained fixed upon a photograph standing partially
hidden by a leather collar box upon the dresser He looked at it
intently then rose and took it in his hand

Well I swan he exclaimed Either what my heads been the fullest
of lately has struck to my eyesight or elsewhy say Jim thats
Caroline aint it

Pearson colored and seemed embarrassed Yes he answered that is
Miss Warren

Humph Good likeness too But what kind of rig has she got on Ive
seen her wear a good many dressesseems to have a different one for
every day pretty nighbut I never saw her in anything like that
Looks sort of outlandish like one of them foreign girls at Genevaor
Leghorn say

Yes That is an Italian peasant costume Miss Warren wore it at a fancy
dress ball a year ago

Want to know Italian peasant hey Fifth Avenue peasant with diamonds
in her hair Becomin to her aint it

I thought so

Yup She looks pretty _enough_ But she dont need diamonds nor
handorgan clothes to make her pretty

Then looking up from the photograph he asked Give you this picture
did she

His friends embarrassment increased No he answered shortly Then
after an instants hesitation That ball was given by the Astorbilts
and was one of the most swagger affairs of the season The _Planet_the
paper with which I was connectedissues a Sunday supplement of
halftone reproductions of photographs One page was given up to
pictures of the ball and the costumes worn there

I see Astonishin how folks do like to get their faces into print
I used to know an old womanAunt Hepsibah Tucker her name wasshes
dead now The pride of Aunt Hepsys heart was that she took nineteen
bottles of Balm of Burdock Tea and the tea folks printed her picture
as a testimonial that she lived through it Ho ho And society bigbugs
appear to have the same cravin

Some of them do But that of your niece was obtained by our society
reporter from the photographer who took it Bribery and corruption of
course Miss Warren would have been at least surprised to see it in
our supplement I fancied she might not care for so much publicity and
suppressed it

Umhm Well I guess you did right Ill thank you for her By the
way I told Caroline where I was callatin to go this mornin and she
wished to be remembered to you

Pearson seemed pleased but he made no comment Captain Elisha blew a
smoke ring from his pipe

And say Jim he added embarrassed in his turn I hope you wont
think Im interferin in your affairs but are you still set against
comin up to where I live I know you said you had a reason but are you
sure its a good one

He waited for an answer but none came Pearson was gazing out of the
window The captain looked at his watch and rose

I guess Ill have to be goin he said Its after twelve now

His host swung around in his chair Sit down Captain he said Ive
been doing a lot of thinking since I saw you and Im not sure about
that reason I believe Ill ask your advice It is a delicate matter
and it involves your brother You may see it as he did and if so our
friendship ends I suppose But Im going to risk it

Mr Rodgers Warren and I he went on were well acquainted during
the latter part of my newspaper work I was financial man on the
_Planet_ and some articles I wrote took your brothers fancy At all
events he wrote me concerning them in highly complimentary terms and
asked me to call and see him at his office I did so andwell we
became very friendly so much so that he invited me to his house I
dined there several times was invited to call often andI enjoyed
it You see I had few friends in the city outside my journalistic
acquaintances and I suppose I was flattered by Mr Warrens kindness
and the fancy he seemed to have taken to me And I liked Miss
Warrenno one could help thatand I believed she liked me

She does like you interrupted his companion with surprise
Carolines a good girl

Yes she is However she isnt in this story except as a sideissue
At this time my ambitions were for a newspaper career and I thought I
was succeeding And her fathers marked interest and the things he said
to me promised more than an ordinary success He was a well known man on
the street and influential So my head began to swell and I dreameda
lot of foolishness And then

He paused put down his empty pipe and sighed

Well then he continued came the upset I judged from what you
said at our previous conversation Captain that you were well enough
acquainted with Wall Street to know that queer operations take place
there Did you read about the South Shore Trolley business

Captain Elisha considered Why yes he said slowly seems if I
did One of those consolidations with holdin companies and franchises
and extensions and water by the hogshead Want that it I remember
now the Boston papers had considerable about it and I presume likely
the New York ones had more One of those allaccordintolaw swindles
that sprout same as toadstools in a dark place but die out if the
lights turned on too sudden This one didnt come to nothin but a bad
smell if I remember right

You do And I suppose Im responsible for the smell I got wind of
the thing investigated found out something of what was going on and
printed a preliminary story in the _Planet_ It caused a sensation

He paused once more Captain Elisha for the sake of saying something
observed I shouldnt wonder

It certainly did And the morning on which it appeared Mr Rodgers
Warren phoned me He wished to see me at once I went down to his
office Captain I dislike to tell you this Mr Warren was your
brother

I know he was And Im his executor Both those reasons make me
specially anxious to have you tell me the truth Heave ahead now to
oblige me

Well I found him very polite and cordial at first He said that a
ridiculous and sensational story concerning the Trolley Combine had
appeared in the _Planet_ and he would like to have me contradict it and
suppress further falsehoods of the kind I told him I couldnt do that
because the story was true I had written it myself He was angry and I
could see that he was holding himself in by main strength I went on to
explain that it was the duty of an honest paper as I saw it to expose
such trespass upon the peoples rights He asked me if I knew who was
behind the scheme I said I knew some of the backers They were pretty
big men too Then he informed me that he himself was deeply interested

I was knocked off my feet by that you can imagine And to be frank
Captain if I had known it at first Im not sure that I personally
would have taken the matter up Yet I might I cant tell But now that
I had done it and discovered what I had I couldnt give it up I must
go on and learn more And I knew enough already to be certain that the
more I learned the more I should write and have published It was one of
those things which had to be made publicif a fellow had a conscience
about him and a pride in the decency of his profession

All this was going through my head as I sat there in his private
office And he took my surprise and hesitation as symptoms of wavering
and went at me hard Of course I knew he said that the operation was
absolutely within the law I did but that didnt make it more honest or
moral or just He went on to say that in large financial deals of this
nature petty scruples must be lost sight of Good of the business
rights of stockholders all that sort of stuff he rang the changes All
the papers cared for was sensation to imperil the fortune of widows and
orphans whose savings were invested in the South Shore Stock for the
sake of sensation was a crime He should have known better than to say
that to me it is such an ancient wornout platitude

I know Ive been to political meetins The widows and orphans
are always hangin on the success of the Republican partyor the
Democratic whichever way you vote The amount of tears shed over their
investments by fellers you wouldnt trust with a brass fivecent piece
is somethin amazin Go on I didnt mean to interrupt

Then he switched to a more personal appeal He said he had taken a
fancy to me had liked me from the very beginning He recognized my
unusual genius at first sight and had gone as far as to make plans
bearing directly on my future He was associated with men of wealth and
business sagacity Large deals of which the Trolley Combine was but
one were on foot He and his friends needed a representative on the
pressa publicity agent so to speak Some of the greatest corporations
employed men of that kind and the salaries paid were large and the
opportunities afforded greater still Well thats true enough I know
writers who are doing just that thing and getting rich at it I suppose
theyve squared their consciences somehow and are willing to write lies
and misleading articles for what there is in it I cant thats all
Im not built that way and I told him so

It ended in an open break He reminded me of the favors he had done me
He had treated me almost like a son had introduced me to his family
entertaining me at his table Where was my gratitude That was another
bad break on his part for it made me mad I told him I had not asked to
be adopted or fed by him if I had supposed his kindness had an ulterior
motive I would have seen him at the devil before I accepted a favor My
career as a financial visitor was ended Get out of his office I got
But the Trolley Combine did not go through The _Planet_ and the other
papers kept up the fight andand the widows and orphans are bankrupt I
presume

Captain Elishas pipe had gone out long since He absently rubbed the
warm bowl between his palms

Humph he muttered So Bije was deep in that business was he

He was Very deep indeed I found out afterwards And I declare I
almost pitied him at the time He acted as if his whole fortune was
staked on the gamble His hands shook and the perspiration stood on his
forehead as he talked I felt as if I had been the means of ruining
him But of course I hadnt He lived for some time after that and I
understand died a rich man

Yes He left what Id call a heap of money My nephew and niece dont
seem to think so but I do

So you see Captain why I stopped calling on the Warrens and why I
did not accept Miss Warrens invitation

I see I see And yet I dont know Bije may have took to you
for business reasons but the children didnt They liked you for
yourself Caroline as much as said so And their father never told em a
word about the row neither Of course you couldnt have called when he
was alive but hes gone and Imwell Im sort of temporary skipper
there now And _I_ want you to come

But if Miss Warren did know She should know I think

I aint sure that she should I guess theres considerble in her pas
life she aint acquainted with And shes as straight and honest and
upright as a schooners fomast You did nothin to be shamed of Its
the other way round cordin to my notion But leave her out of
it now Ive sacrificed some few things to take the job Ive got at
present but I cant afford to sacrifice my friends I count on you as a
friend and I want you to come and see _me_ Will you

I dont know Captain Warren I must think it over a while I guess

All rightthink But the invitation stands_my_ invitation And if
you want to shift responsibility shift it on to me Some day if itll
make you feel better Ill tell Caroline and Stevie the whole story But
I want them to know you and the worldand mea little better first
Cordin to my notion they need education just along that line Theyve
got teachers in other branches but There Ive _got_ to be goin
Theres the dinner bell now

The string of Japanese gongs hung in the lower hall sounded
sonorously Captain Elisha reached for his coat and hat but Pearson
caught his arm

No you dont he declared Youre going to stay and have lunch with
mehere If you say no I shall believe it is because you are afraid of
a boardinghouse meal

His guest protested but the protests were overruled and he and
his host went down to the dining room The captain whispered as they
entered Land sakes Jim this takes me back home Its pretty nigh a
twin to the dinin room at the Centre House in South Denboro

     

All boardinghouse dining rooms bear a family likeness so the comment
was not far wrong A long table rows of chairs on each side ancient
and honorable pictures on the walls the landlady presiding majestically
over the teapot the boarders napkins in ringsall the familiar
landmarks were present

Most of the male regulars were in business about the city and
therefore lunched elsewhere but the females were in evidence Pearson
introduced his guest The captain met Mrs Hepton the landlady plump
grayhaired and graciously hospitable She did not look at all like
a business woman but appearances are not always to be trusted Mrs
Hepton had learned not to trust themalso delinquent boarders too far
He met Miss Sherborne whose coiffure did not match in spots but whose
voice so he learned afterward had been cultivated abroad Miss
Sherborne gave music lessons Mrs Van Winkle Ruggles also claimed his
attention and held it principally because of the faded richness of her
apparel Mrs Ruggles was a widow suffering from financial reverses
the contrast between her present mode of living and the grandeur of the
past formed her principal topic of conversation

There were half a dozen others including an artist whose aversion to
barbers was proclaimed by the luxuriant length of his locks a quiet old
gentleman who kept the secondhand book store two doors below his wife
a neat trim little body and Mr and Mrs C Dickens no less

Mr Dickens was bald an affliction which he tried to conceal by
brushing the hair at the sides of his head across the desert at the
top He shaved his cheeks and wore a beard and mustache Mrs Dickens
addressed him as C and handed him the sauce bottle the bread or
whatever she imagined he desired as if she were offering sacrifice to
an idol

She sat next to Captain Elisha and imparted information concerning her
lord and master in whispers during the intervals between offerings

My husband will be pleased to meet you Captain Warren she murmured
Any friend of Mr Pearson is certain to be an acquisition Mr Pearson
and my husband are congenial spirits they are members of the same
profession

I want to know maam

Yes What is it C dear Oh the butter Margaret to the
waitressMr Dickens wishes another butterball Yes Captain Warren
Mr Dickens is an author Havent you noticed theerresemblance It
is considered quite remarkable

Captain Elisha looked puzzled Why he said I hadnt noticed it
special JimsMr Pearsonseyes and his are some the same color
but

Oh no not the resemblance to Mr Pearson I didnt mean _that_ The
resemblance to his more famous namesake Surely you notice it _now_

The captain shook his head IIm afraid Im thickheaded maam he
admitted Im out of soundins

But the nose and his beard and his manner Dont they remind you of
the English Dickens

Ooh Captain Elisha inspected the great man with interest He had
a vague memory of a portrait in a volume of Pickwick at home Oh I
see Yes yes

Of course you see Everyone does Mr Dickens often saysit is one of
his favorite jokesthat while other men must choose a profession his
was chosen for him by fate How with such a name could he do anything
except write

I dont know maam But names are risky pilots aint they Ive run
against a considerble number of Solomons but there want one of em
that carried moren a deckload of wisdom They christened me Elisha but
I cant even prophesy the weather with sartinty enough to bet However
I daresay in your husbands case its all right

The lady had turned away and he was afraid he might have offended her
The fear was groundless she was merely offering another sacrifice the
sugar this time

Yes she asked turning you were saying

Whyernothin of account I callate the C stands for Charles
then

Noo Mr Dickenss Christian name is Cornelius but dont mention it
before him he is very sensitive on that point

The Dickenses tickled the captain exceedingly and after the meal was
over he spoke of them to Pearson

Say he said youre in notorious company aint you Jim What has
Cornelius Charles turned out so far in the way of masterpieces

Pearson laughed I believe he is employed by a subscription house
he replied Doing hack work on an encyclopedia A great collection of
freaks arent they Captain Warren

Kind of But that old bookshop man and his wife seem nice folks And
as for freaks the average boardin house city or country seems
to draw em like flies I guess most anybody would get queer if they
boarded all the time

Perhaps so Or if they werent queer they wouldnt board permanently
from choice There are two or three good fellows who dine and breakfast
here The food isnt bad considering the price

No it aint Tasted more like home than any meal Ive had for a good
while Im afraid I never was cut out for swell livin

Mrs Hepton approached them as they stood in the hall She wished to
know if Mr Pearsons friend was thinking of finding lodgings Because
Mr Saksthe artists namewas giving up the second floor back in a
fortnight and it was a very pleasant room We should be delighted to
add you to our little circle Captain Warren

Pearson told her that his companion was already lodged and she said
goodby and left them The captain smiled broadly

Everything in New York seems to be circles he declared Well Jim
you come up and circulate with me first chance you get Im dependin
on you to call remember

The young man was still doubtful

Ill see he said I cant promise yetperhaps I will

You willafter youve thought it out to a finish And come soon Im
gettin interested in that second edition of your Uncle Jim and I want
to keep along with him as fast as you write Goodby Much obliged for
the dinnerthere I go againluncheon I mean




CHAPTER XII


Pearson called He appeared at the apartment a week after the luncheon
at the boarding house and was welcomed by the Captain Elisha who
hearing his voice strode into the hall sent the shocked Edwards to the
rightabout in a hurry seized his friends hand and ushered him into
the library Pearson said nothing concerning his change of mind the
course of reasoning which led him to make the visit and the captain
asked no questions He took it for granted that the young fellows
common sense had turned the trick and the result being what it was
that was sufficient

They spent a pleasant afternoon together Caroline was out and they had
the library to themselves The newest chapters of the novel were read
and discussed and the salty flavor of the talk was as pronounced as
ever Pearson left early but promised to come again very soon

When Caroline returned her uncle told her of his visitor She seemed
unfeignedly pleased but regretted that she had not been there He was
such a friend of fathers she said that seeing him here would be
almost like the old days And so many of those whom we thought were his
friends and ours have left us

This was true Rodgers Warren and his children had had many
acquaintances had been active in church and charitable work and their
former home was a center of entertainment and gayety while he lived But
his death and the rumors of shrinkage in the family fortune the giving
up of the Fifth Avenue residence the period of mourning which forbade
social functions all these helped to bring about forgetfulness on the
part of the many and Carolines supersensitiveness and her firm resolve
not to force her society where it might be unwelcome had been the causes
of misunderstanding in others whose liking and sympathy were genuine
I dont see what has come over Caroline Warren declared a former girl
friend she isnt a bit as she used to be Well Ive done my part If
she doesnt wish to return my call she neednt _I_ shant annoy her
again But Im sorry for she was the sweetest girl I knew

Stephen had never been very popular and his absence at college still
further reduced the number of young people who might be inclined to
call Their not calling confirmed Carolines belief that she and
her brother were deliberately shunned because of their change in
circumstances and she grew more sensitive and proudly resentful in
consequence Naturally she turned for comfort to those who remained
faithful the Dunns in particular They were loyal to her Therefore
with the intensity of her nature she became doubly loyal to them The
rector of St Denis dropped in frequently and others occasionally but
she was lonely She craved the society of those nearer her own age

Pearsons coming then was psychologically apt When he made his next
call upon Captain Elisha to find the latter out but his niece at home
she welcomed him cordially and insisted upon his waiting until her
guardian returned The conversation was at first embarrassing for the
exreporter she spoke of her father and Pearsonthe memory of his
last interview with the latter fresh in his mind and painfully aware
that she knew nothing of itfelt guilty and like a hypocrite But soon
the subject changed and when the captain entered the library he found
the pair laughing and chatting like old acquaintances as of course
they were

Captain Elisha paying no attention to his friends shakes of the head
invited his niece to be present at the reading of the latest addition to
what he called mine and Jims recordbreakin sea yarn

Its really mine you understand Caroline he observed with a wink
Im silent partner in the firmif you can call the one that does all
the talkin silentand Jim dont do nothin but make it up and write it
and get the profits Course you mustnt mention this to him cause he
thinks hes the author and twould hurt his feelins

Hes quite right declared Pearson emphatically If the thing is
ever finished and published he will deserve all the credit His advice
had already remade it This uncle of yours Miss Warren he added
turning to her is like the admiral Kipling wrote abouthe has lived
more stories than ever I could invent

The captain fearful that his niece might take the statement seriously
hastened to protest

Hes just foolin Caroline he said All Ive done is set and talk
and talk and talk Ive used up more of his time and the surroundin air
than youd believe was possible When I get next to salt water even in
print its time to muzzle me same as a dog in July The yarn is Jims
altogether and its mighty interestinto me anyhow

Im sure it will be to me also declared the young lady Captain
Warren has told me all about it Mr Pearson and Im very eager to hear
the new portion

There Captain Elisha slapped his knee There Jim he exclaimed
you hear that Now youve _got_ to read it Anchors apeak Heave ahead
and get under way

So because he could not well refuse the author reluctantly began
to read And as usual his nautical friend to interrupt and comment
Caroline listened her eyes twinkling When the reading and the
arguments were at an end she declared it was all splendid Just like
being at sea ones self she said I positively refuse to permit
another installment to be submitted unless I amon deck Thats the
proper phrase isnt it Captain

Aye aye maam Jim weve shipped a new second mate and shes goin
to be wuth her salt You hear _me_

She proved to be worth all of that at least in Pearsons opinion His
calls and the readings and discussions became more and more frequent
Each of the trio enjoyed them greatly Caroline quite as much as the
others Here was something new and fresh something to furnish a real
interest The story advanced rapidly the character of the nautical hero
shaped itself better and better and the heroine also heretofore a
somewhat shadowy and vague young woman began to live and breathe
She changed surprisingly not only in mental but in physical
characteristics

Captain Elisha was first to notice the latter peculiarity

Say Jim he interrupted one afternoon what was that you just read
about Mary Her hat blowin off to leeward and her brown hair blowin
after it Or somethin of that sort

Caroline laughed merrily The author turned to the passage mentioned

Not exactly Captain he replied smiling I said her hat had blown
away and her brown curls tossed in the wind Whats wrong with that
Hats do blow away in a souwester Ive seen them

Perhaps he thinks she should have been more careful in pinning it on
suggested the feminine member of the advisory board

Captain Elisha shook his head No he observed calmly but why was
she wearin that kind of hair Shes pretty young to use a switch aint
she

Switch repeated Marys creator with some indignation What are
you talking about When I first described her I said that her hair was
luxuriant and one of her chief beauties

Thats a fact So you did What made her dye it

Dye it What do you think she isa chorus girl

If I remember right shes a postmasters daughter But why is she
wearin brown hair if it aint neither false or dyed Back in the third
chapter twas _black_ like her eyes

Caroline burst into another laugh Pearson blushed to his forehead
Well by George he admitted youre right I believe I did have it
black at first

You sartin did I aint got any objections to either color only it
ought to stay put hadnt it In a town of the size shes livin in a
girl with changeable hair is likely to be kind of conspicuous I tell
you maybe it bleached out in the sun Ho ho

The writer made a note on the margin of his manuscript and declared
that his heroines tresses and eyes should be made to correspond at
all stages They did but they remained brown Captain Elisha chuckled
inwardly but offered no further comments Caroline whose own hair and
eyes were brown did not refer to the matter at all

She and the young man became better acquainted at each succeeding
literary clinic as the latter called them When Rodgers Warren first
introduced him at their former home he had impressed her favorably
largely because of her desire to like anyone whom her father fancied
She worshiped the dead broker and his memory to her was sacred She
would have forgiven and did forgive any wrong he might have done her
even his brothers appointment as guardian though that she could not
understand Unlike Stephen who fiercely resented the whole affair and
said bitter things concerning his parent she believed he had done what
he considered right Her feeling against Captain Elisha had been based
upon the latters acceptance of that appointment when he should have
realized his unfitness And his living with them and disgracing them in
the eyes of their friends by his uncouth country ways made her blind
to his good qualities The Moriarty matter touched her conscience
and she saw more clearly But she was very far from considering him
an equal or other than what Mrs Corcoran Dunn termed him an
encumbrance even yet She forced herself to be kind and tolerant and
gave him more of her society though the churchgoing experience was
not repeated nor did she accompany him on his walks or outofdoor
excursions

If Pearsons introductions had been wholly as a friend of her
guardian her feeling toward him might have been tinged with the same
condescension or aversion even But hallowed as he was by association
with her father she welcomed him for the latters sake And as she
became interested in the novel and found that her suggestions concerning
it were considered valuable she looked forward to his visits and was
disappointed if for any reason they were deferred Without being aware
of it she began to like the young author not alone because he wrote
entertainingly and flattered her by listening respectfully to her
criticisms or because her father had liked him but for himself

Captain Elisha was much pleased

I told you Jim he said Shes just as glad to see you as I am Now
dont you see how foolish it was to stay away cause you and Bije had
a spat Think of all the good times wed have missed And we needed a
female aboard your Uncle Jims craft to help with Mary and the rest

His friend nodded She has been a great help certainly he answered
But I cant help feeling guilty every time I come here It is too much
like obtaining her friendship under false pretenses She should know the
whole thing I believe

She shall know it when I think its time for her to But I want her to
know you first Then shell be able to judge without so much prejudice
I told you Id take the responsibility You leave the ship in my charge
for a spell

In spite of this confident assertion the captain also felt a trifle
guilty He realized that selfishness was involved in his keeping
Pearsons secret from his niece He was thoroughly enjoying himself with
these two and he could not bear to risk the breaking up which might
follow disclosure

One evening while a clinic was in progress and the three were deep
in consultation Edwards entered to announce Mrs Corcoran Dunn and
Mr Malcolm The butlers giving the lady precedence in his announcing
showed that he too realized who was ranking officer in that family
even though the captains conundrum had puzzled him Mrs Dunn and her
son entered at his heels

Illustration She and the young man became better acquainted at each
succeeding literary clinic

The lady took in the group by the table at a glance Pearson with
the manuscript in his hands Captain Elisha leaning back in his chair
frowning at the interruption Caroline rising to welcome the guests and
coloring slightly as she did so All these details Mrs Dunn noted made
an entry in her mental memorandumbook and underscored it for future
reference

If she discerned unpleasant possibilities in the situation she did
not allow them to disturb her outward serenity She kissed Caroline and
called her dear child as fondly as usual shook hands graciously with
Captain Elisha and bowed condescending recognition of Pearson

And how is the novel coming on Do tell me she begged Im sure we
interrupted a reading Its too bad of us really But Malcolm insisted
upon coming He has been very busy of latesome dreadful corner or
other on the exchangeand has neglected his friendsor thinks he has
I told him I had explained it all to you Caroline but he _would_ come
tonight It is the first call he has made in weeks so you _see_ But
there he doesnt consider running in here a call

Call or not it spoiled the evening for at least two of the company
Pearson left early Captain Elisha excused himself soon after and went
to his room leaving the Dunns to chat with Caroline for an hour or
more Malcolm joked and was languid and cynical His mother asked a few
carefully guarded questions

Quite a clever person this young author friend of yours seems to be
Caroline she observed Almost brilliant really

He isnt a friend of mine exactly replied the girl He and Captain
Warren are friendly and father used to know and like him as I have
told you The novel is great fun though The people in it are coming to
seem almost real to me

I daresay I was a great reader myself once before my healthmy
heart you knowbegan to trouble me The doctors now forbid my reading
anything the least bit exciting Has thiserMr Pearson means

I know very little of him personally but I think not He used to be
connected with the _Planet_ and wrote things about Wall Street That
was how father came to know him

Live in an attic does he inquired Malcolm Thats what all authors
do isnt it Put up in attics and sleep on palletswhatever they
areand eat crusts dont they Jolly lifeif you like it I prefer
bucking wheat corners myself

Mrs Dunn laughed and Caroline joined her though not as heartily

How ridiculous you are Malcolm exclaimed his mother Mr Pearson
isnt that kind of an author Im sure But where does he live
Caroline

Somewhere on West 18th Street I believe He has rooms there I think

Oh Really And how is this wonderful novel of his progressing When
does he expect to favor us with it

I dont know But it is progressing very well at present He has
written three chapters since last Wednesday He was reading them to us
when you came

Indeed Since last Wednesday How interesting

Malcolm did not seem to find the topic interesting for he smothered a
yawn His mother changed the subject On their way home however she
again referred to it

You must make it a point to see her every day she declared No
matter what happens you must do it

Oh Lord groaned her son I cant Theres the deuce and all on
Change just now and the billiard tournaments begun at the Club My
days and nights are full up Once a week is all she should expect I
think

No matter what you think or what she expects you must do as I say

Why

Because I dont like the looks of things

Oh rubbish Youre always seeing bugaboos Uncle Hayseed is pacified
isnt he Ive paid the Moriarty crowd off Beastly big bills they were
too

Humph Uncle Hayseed as you call him is anything but a fool But he
isnt the particular trouble at present He and I understand each other
I believe and he will be reasonable Butthere is this Pearson I
dont like his calling so frequently

Malcolm laughed in huge scorn Pearson he sneered Why hes
nothing but a pennyaliner without the penny Surely youre not afraid
Caroline will take a fancy to him She isnt an idiot

Shes a young girl and more romantic than I wish she was At her age
girls do silly things sometimes He called on Wednesdayyou heard her
say soand was there again tonight I dont like it I tell you

Her uncle is responsible for

It is more than that She knew him long before she knew her uncle
existed Her father introduced himher _father_ And to her mind
whatever her father did was right

Witness his brilliant selection of an executor Oh Mater you weary
me I used to know this Pearson when he was a reporter downtown
and Humph

What is it

Why nothing I guess It seemed as if I remember Warren and Pearson in
some sort of mixup Some Humph I wonder

He was silent thinking His mother pressed his arm excitedly

If you remember anything that occurred between Rodgers Warren and
this man anything to this Pearsons disadvantage it may pay us to
investigate What was it

I dont know But it seemed as if I remembered Warrens  or a friend
of his telling me  saying something  but it couldnt be of
importance because Caroline doesnt know it

Im not so sure that it may not be important And if you recall on
that day when we first met him at Carolines she seemed hurt because he
had not visited them since her father died Perhaps there _was_ a
reason At any rate I should look into the matter

All right Mater just as you say Really you ought to join a Dont
Worry Club

One member in the family is quite sufficient And I expect you to
devote yourself to Caroline from now on That girl is lonely and
when you get the combination of a lonely romantic young girl and a
goodlooking and interesting young fellow even though he is as poor
as a church mouse _anything_ may happen Add to that the influence of
an unpractical but sharp old Yankee relative and guardianthen the
situation is positively dangerous




CHAPTER XIII


An important event was about to take place At least it seemed
important to Captain Elisha although the person most intimately
concerned appeared to have forgotten it entirely He ventured to remind
her of it

Caroline he said Sunday is your birthday aint it

His niece looked at him in surprise Yes she answered it is How
did you know

Why I remembered thats all Graves the lawyer man told me how
old you and Stevie were fust time I met him And his partner Mr
Sylvester gave me the date one day when he was goin over your pas
will Youll be twenty years old Sunday wont you

Yes

It was late in the afternoon and she had been out since ten oclock
shopping with Mrs Dunn lunching downtown with the latter and Malcolm
and motoring for an hour or two The weather for the season was mild and
sunny and the crisp air had brightened her cheeks her eyes sparkled
her fur coat and cap were very becoming and Captain Elisha inspected
her admiringly before making another remark

My My he exclaimed after an instants pause Twenty years old
Think of it Bijes girls a young woman now aint she I callate he
was proud of you too He ought to have been I presume likely _he_
didnt forget your birthday

He rose to help her with the heavy coat As he lifted it from her
shoulders he bent forward and caught a glimpse of her face

There there he said hastily Dont feel bad dearie I didnt mean
to hurt your feelins Excuse me I was thinkin out loud sort of

She did not answer at once but turned away to remove her cap Then she
answered without looking at him

He never forgot them she said

Course he didnt Well you see I didnt forget either

It was an unfortunate remark inasmuch as it drew in her mind
a comparison between her handsome dignified father and his rude
uncultured brother The contrast was ever present in her thoughts and
she did not need to be reminded of it She made no reply

I was thinkin continued the captain conscious of having made a
mistake that maybe we might celebrate somehow in a quiet way

No I am not in the mood forcelebrations

Oh I didnt mean fireworks and the town band I just thought

Please dont I remember other birthdays too well They had been great
occasions those birthdays of hers ever since she was a little girl On
the eighteenth she made her debut in society and the gown she wore on
that memorable evening was laid away upstairs a cherished memento to
be kept as long as she lived Each year Rodgers Warren took infinite
pains to please and surprise his idolized daughter She could not bear
to think of another birthday now that he had been taken from her

Her guardian pulled his beard Well he observed ruefully then my
weak heads put my foot in it again as the feller said If I aint
careful Ill be like poor cracked Philander Baker who lives with
his sister over at Denboro Centre The doctor told Philander he was
threatened with softenin of the brain and the sister thanked him for
the compliment You see Caroline I wrote on my own hook and asked
Stevie to come home Saturday and stay till Monday I kind of thought
youd like to have him here

Oh I should like _that_ But will he come Has he written you

Hey Yes I callate hell be on deck Heseryes hes written me

He smiled as he answered As a matter of fact the correspondence
between Stephen and himself had been lengthy and voluminous on the part
of the former and brief and businesslike on his own The boy on his
return to college had found conditions awaiting him and the amount
of hard work involved in their clearance was not at all to his taste
He wrote his guardian before the first week was over asserting that the
whole business was foolishness and a waste of time He should come
home at once he said and he notified the captain that such was his
intention Captain Elisha replied with promptness and decision If he
came home he would be sent back that was all I realize youve got a
job ahead of you Son wrote the captain but you can do it if you
will Fact is I guess youve got to So sail in and show us what youre
made of

Stephens answer was a five page declaration of independence He refused
to be bullied by any living man He had made arrangements to come to New
York on the following Monday and he was coming As to being sent back
he wished his uncle to understand that it was one thing to order and
another to enforce obedience To which he received the following note

 I cant stop you from coming Steve except by going to New
 Haven and holding you by main strength That I dont propose
 to do for two reasons first that it is too much trouble
 and second that it aint necessary You can come home once in
 a while to see your sister but you mustnt do it till I say
 the word If you do I shall take the carfare out of your
 allowance likewise board while you are here and stop that
 allowance for a month as a sort of fine for mutiny So you
 better think it over a spell And if I was you I wouldnt
 write Caroline that I was coming or thinking of coming till
 I had my mind made up She believes you are working hard at
 your lessons I shouldnt disappoint her especially as it
 wouldnt be any use

 Your affectionate uncle
 ELISHA WARREN

The result of all this was that Stephen whose finances were already in
a precarious condition did think it over and decided not to take the
risk Also conscious that his sister sided with their guardian to the
extent of believing the university the best place for him at present he
tore up the long letter of grievance which he had written her and in
that which took its place mentioned merely that he was grinding like
blazes and the only satisfaction he got from it was his removal from
the society of the old tyrant from Cape Cod

He accepted the tyrants invitation to return for the weekend and
his sisters birthday with no hesitation whatever and his letter of
acceptance was so politic as to be almost humble

He arrived on an early train Saturday morning Caroline met him at the
station and the Dunns car conveyed them to the latters residence
where they were to spend the day The Dunns and Caroline had been
together almost constantly since the evening when Malcolm and his mother
interrupted the reading of the novel The former while professing to be
harassed by business cares sacrificed them to the extent of devoting at
least a part of each twentyfour hours to the young ladys society
She was rarely allowed to be alone with her uncle a circumstance which
troubled her much less than it did him He missed the evenings which he
had enjoyed so much and the next consultation over the adventures
of Pearsons Uncle Jim and his Mary seemed flat and uninteresting
without criticism and advice

The author himself noticed the difference

Rot he exclaimed throwing the manuscript aside in disgust Its
rot isnt it If I cant turn out better stuff than that Id better
quit And I thought it was pretty decent too until tonight

Captain Elisha shook his head It dont seem quite so shipshape
somehow he admitted but I guess likely its cause my heads full
of other things just now Im puzzled most to death to know what to get
for Carolines birthday I want to get her somethin shell like and
shes got pretty nigh everything under the sun Say Jim youve been
workin too hard yourself Why dont you take tomorrow off and cruise
around the stores helpin me pick out a present Come aheaddo

They spent the next afternoon in that cruise visiting department
stores jewelers and art shops innumerable Captain Elisha was hard to
please and his comments characteristic

I guess youre right Jim he said theres no use lookin at
pictures Let alone that the walls are so covered with em now a fly
cant scarcely light without steppin on some kind of scenerylet
alone that my judgment on pictures aint any good I callate thats
considered pretty fine aint it pointing to a painting in the gallery
where they then were

Yes replied the dealer much amused That is a good specimen of the
modern impressionist school

Humph Cookin school I shouldnt wonder Id call it a portrait of a
plate of scrambled eggs if twant for that green thing thats either
a cow or a church in the offin Out of soundins again I am But I
knew she liked pictures and so However lets set sail for a
jewelry store

The sixth shop of this variety which they visited happened to be one of
the largest and most fashionable in the city Here the captains fancy
was taken by a gold chain for the neck set with tiny emeralds

Thats prettysort ofaint it Jim he asked

Yes replied his companion with emphasis it is And I think youll
find it is expensive also

That so How much turning to the salesman

The latter gave the price of the chain Captain Elisha whistled

Whew Jerushy he exclaimed And it wouldnt much more than go around
my wrist at that All the same size are they

No Some are longer The longer ones are higher priced of course

Sartin Theyre for fleshy folks I spose Mrs Thoph Kenney down
home shed have to splice three of em together to make the round trip
Thophs always scared he wont get his moneys wuth in a trade but he
couldnt kick when he got her To give the minister a dollar and walk
off with two hundred and eighty pounds of wife is showin some business
sagacity hey To do him justice I will say that _he_ seems to be
satisfied shes the one that does the complainin I guess this is the
most expensive counter in the store aint it Mister

The clerk laughed No indeed he said These are all moderate priced
goods I wonder turning to Pearson if your friend wouldnt like to
see some of our choice pieces It is a quiet day here and I shall be
glad to show them

He led the way to a set of show cases near the door on the Fifth Avenue
side There before Captain Elishas dazzled eyes were displayed diamond
necklaces and aigrettes tiaras and brooches the figures on their price
tags running high into the thousands Pearson and the goodnatured clerk
enjoyed themselves hugely

Jim said the captain after a little of this is there a police
officer lookin this way

Pearson laughed I guess not he answered Why The temptation isnt
getting too much for your honesty is it

No with a sigh but Im carryin a forty dollar watch and wearin a
ring that cost fifteen I thought they was some punkins till I begun
to look at this stuff Now they make me feel so mean and povertystruck
that I expect to be took up for a tramp any minute Mister to the
clerk you run right along and wrap up that chain I was lookin at
Hurry or Ill be ashamed to carry anything so cheap

Think shell like it do you Jim he asked when they were once more
out of doors with the purchase in his inside pocket

She ought certainly replied Pearson Its a beautiful thing

Yes Well you see apologetically I wanted to give her somethin
pretty good Bije always did and I didnt want to fall too fur behind
But with a chuckle you neednt mention the price to anybody If
Abbiemy second cousin keepin house for me she isif Abbie heard
of it shed be for puttin me in an asylum Abbies got a hair
breastpin and a tortoise shell comb but she only wears em to the
Congregationalist meetinhouse where shes reasonably sure there aint
likely to be any sneakthieves She went to a Unitarian sociable once
but she carried em in a bag inside her dress

Captain Elisha planned to surprise his niece with the gift at breakfast
on the morning of her birthday but after reflection decided to
postpone the presentation until dinner time The inevitable Dunns had
taken upon themselves the duty of caring for the girl and her brother
during the major part of the day The yellow car appeared at the door
at ten oclock and bore the two away Caroline assured her guardian
however that they would return in season for the evening meal

The captain spent lonely but busy hours until dinner time came He had
done some scheming on his own hook and after a long argument with
the cook reenforced by a small sum in cash had prevailed upon that
haughty domestic to fashion a birthday cake of imposing exterior and
indigestible makeup Superintending the icing of this masterpiece
occupied some time He then worried Edwards into a respectful but
stubborn fury by suggesting novelties in the way of table arrangement
Another bestowal of small change quelled the disturbance Then came
by messenger a dozen American Beauty roses with Mr Pearsons card
attached These the captain decided should be placed in the center of
the festive board As a center piece had been previously provided there
was more argument The cook took the butlers side in the debate and
the pair yielded only when Captain Elisha again dived into his pocket

But I warn you all hands he observed that this is the last time
My right fists got a cramp in it this minute and you couldnt open it
again with a cold chisel

At last however everything was as it should be and he sat down in the
library to await the coming of the young people The gold chain in its
handsome leather case the latter enclosed in the jewelers box was
carefully laid beside Carolines place at the table The dinner was
ready the cake candles and allthe captain had insisted upon twenty
candleswas ready also There was nothing to do but waitand he
waited

Sixthirty was the usual dinner hour It passed Seven oclock struck
then eight and still Captain Elisha sat alone in the library The cook
sent word that the dinner was ruined Edwards respectfully asked What
shall I do sir twice the second time being sent flying with an order
to Go forard and keep your hatches closed The nautical phraseology
was lost upon the butler but the tone and manner of delivery were quite
understandable

Several times the captain rose from his chair to telephone the Dunn
house and ask the reason for delay Each time he decided not to do so
No doubt there were good reasons Caroline and her brother had been
detained perhaps the automobile had broken downthe things were always
breaking down just at the most inconvenient times perhaps Well at
any rate he would not phone just yet he would wait a little longer

At last the bell rang Captain Elisha sprang up smiling his impatience
and worry forgotten and pushing the butler aside hurried to open
the door himself He did so and faced not his niece and nephew but
Pearson

Good evening Captain hailed the young man cheerily Didnt expect
me did you I dropped in for a moment to shake hands with you and to
offer congratulations to Miss Warren Then noticing the expression on
his friends face he added Whats the matter Anything wrong Am I
intruding

No no Course not Youre as welcome as another egg in a poor mans
henhouse Come right in and take off your things Im glad to see you
Onlywell the fact is I thought twas Caroline comin home She and
Stevie was to be here over two hours ago and I cant imagine whats
keepin em

He insisted upon his visitors remaining although the latter when he
understood the situation was reluctant to do so

Carolinell be real glad to see you Jim I know the captain said
And I want you to stay for my sake Between pacifyin the Commodore
and frettin over what couldnt possibly happen I was half dead of the
fidgets Stay and cheer me up theres a good feller Id just about
reached the stage where I had the girl and boy stove to flinders under
that pesky auto Id even begun to figger on notifyin the undertaker
Tell me Im an old fool and then talk about somethin else Theyll be
here any minute

But a good many minutes passed and still they did not come Pearson
aware of his companions growing anxiety chatted of the novel of the
people at the boarding house of anything and everything he could think
of likely to divert attention from the one important topic The answers
he received were more and more brief and absent At last when Edwards
again appeared appealingly mute at the entrance to the dining room
Captain Elisha with a sigh which was almost a groan surrendered

I guess he said reluctantly I guess Jim there aint any use
waitin any longer Somethins kept em and they wont be here for
dinner You and Ill set down and eatthough I aint got the appetite I
callated to have

Pearson had dined hours before but he followed his friend resolved to
please the latter by going through the form of pretending to eat

They sat down together Captain Elisha with a rueful smile pointed to
the floral centerpiece

Theres your posies Jim he observed Look pretty dont they She
aint seen em yet but shell like em when she does And that over
there is her present from me Stevie gave her a box of gloves and I
expect from what Mrs Dunn hinted that she and that son of hers gave
her somethin fine Shell show us when she gets here Whats this
Commodore Oysters hey Well they ought to taste like home Theyre
Cape Cods I wouldnt have anything else

We wont touch the birthday cake Jim he added a little later
Shes got to cut that herself

The soup was only lukewarm but neither of them commented on the fact
The captain had scarcely tasted of his when he paused his spoon in
air

Hey he exclaimed Listen Whats that By the everlastin it _is_
Here they are at _last_

He sprang up with such enthusiasm that his chair tipped backwards
against the butlers devoted shins Pearson almost as much pleased
also rose

Captain Elisha paid scant attention to the chair incident

What are you waitin for he demanded whirling on Edwards who was
righting the chair with one hand and rubbing his knee with the other
Dont you hear em at the door Let em in

He reached the library first his friend following more leisurely
Caroline and Stephen had just entered

Well he cried in his quarterdeck voice his face beaming with
relief and delight you _are_ here aint you I begun to think
Why whats the matter

The question was addressed to Stephen who stood nearest to him The boy
did not deign to reply With a contemptuous grunt he turned scornfully
away from his guardian

What is it Caroline demanded Captain Elisha _Has_ anything
happened

The girl looked coldly at him A new broochMrs Corcoran Dunns
birthday giftsparkled at her throat

No accident has happened if that is what you mean she said

Butwhy yes that was what I meant You was so awful late and you
know you said youd be home for dinner so

I changed my mind Come Steve

She turned to leave the room Pearson at that moment entered it
Stephen saw him first

_What_ he cried Well of all the nerve Look Caro

JimMr Pearson I meanran in a few minutes ago explained Captain
Elisha bewildered and stammering He thought of course wed had dinner
andandhe just wanted to wish you many happy returns Caroline

Pearson had extended his hand and a Good evening was on his lips
Stephens strange behavior and language caused him to halt He flushed
awkward surprised and indignant

Caroline turned and saw him She started and her cheeks also grew
crimson Then recovering she looked him full in the face and
deliberately and disdainfully turned her back

Come Steve she said again and walked from the room

Her brother hesitated glared at Pearson and then stalked haughtily
after her

Captain Elishas bewilderment was supreme He stared openmouthed
after his nephew and niece and then turned slowly to his friend

What on earth Jim he stammered Whats it _mean_

Pearson shrugged his shoulders I think I know what it means he said
I presume that Miss Warren and her brother have learned of my trouble
with their father

Hey No you dont think _thats_ it

I think theres no doubt of it

But how

I dont know how What I do know is that I should not have come here I
felt it and if you will remember I said so I was a fool Good night
Captain

Hot and furiously angry at his own indecision which had placed him in
this humiliating situation he was striding towards the hall Captain
Elisha seized his arm

Stay where you are Jim he commanded If the troubles what you
think it is Im more to blame than anybody else and you shant leave
this house till Ive done my best to square you

Thank you but I dont wish to be squared Ive done nothing to be
ashamed of and I have borne as many insults as I can stand Im going

No you aint Not yet I want you to stay

At that moment Stephens voice reached them from the adjoining room

I tell you I shall Caro it proclaimed fiercely Do you suppose
Im going to permit that fellow to come here againor to go until he is
made to understand what we think of him and why No by gad Im the man
of this family and Ill tell him a few things

Pearsons jaw set grimly

You may let go of my wrist Captain Warren he said Ill stay

Possibly Stephens intense desire to prove his manliness made him
selfconscious At any rate he never appeared more ridiculously boyish
than when an instant later he marched into the library and confronted
his uncle and Pearson

II want to say he began majestically I want to say

He paused choking and brandished his fist

I want to say he began again

All right Stevie interrupted the captain dryly then Id say it if
I was you I guess its time you did

I want toto tell that fellow _there_ with a vicious stab of his
forefinger in the direction of Pearson that I consider him anan
ingrateand a scoundreland a miserable

Steady Captain Elishas interruption was sharp this time Steady
now Leave out the pet names What is it youve got to tell

Imy sister and I have found out what a scoundrel he is thats what
Weve learned of the lies he wrote about father We know that he was
responsible for all that cowardly lying stuff in the _Planet_all that
about the Trolley Combine And we dont intend that he shall sneak into
this house again If he was the least part of a man he would never have
come

Mr Warren began Pearson stepping forward The captain interrupted

Hold on Jim he said Just a minute now Youve learned somethin
you say Stevie The Dunns told you I spose

Never mind who told me

I dontmuch But I guess wed better have a clear understandin all
of us Caroline will you come in here please

He stepped toward the door Stephen sprang in front of him

My sister doesnt intend to cheapen herself by entering that mans
presence he declared hotly Ill deal with him myself

All right But I guess shed better be here just the same Caroline I
want you

She shant come

Yes she shall Caroline

The boy would have detained him but he pushed him firmly aside and
walked toward the door Before he reached it however his niece
appeared

Well she said coldly What is it you want of me

I want you to hear Mr Pearsons side of this businessand
minebefore you do anything youll be sorry for

I think Ive heard quite enough of Mr Pearson already Nothing he can
say or do will make me more sorry than I am or humiliate me more than
the fact that I have treated him as a friend

The icy contempt in her tone was cutting Pearsons face was white but
he spoke clearly and with deliberation

Miss Warren he said I must insist that you listen for another
moment I owe you an apology for

Apology broke in Stephen with a scornful laugh Apology Well by
gad Just hear that Caro

The girls lip curled I do not wish to hear your apology she said

But I wish you to hear it Not for my attitude in the Trolley
matter nor for what I published in the _Planet_ Nor for my part in
the disagreement with your father I wrote the truth and nothing more I
considered it right thenI told your father soand I have not changed
my mind I should act exactly the same under similar circumstances

You blackguard shouted Stephen Pearson ignored him utterly

I do owe you an apology he continued for coming here as I have
done knowing that you were ignorant of the affair I believe now that
you are misinformed as to the facts but that is immaterial You should
have been told of my trouble with Mr Warren I should have insisted
upon it That I did not do so is my fault and I apologize but for that
only Good evening

He shook himself free from the captains grasp bowed to the trio and
left the room An instant later the outer door closed behind him

Caroline turned to her brother Come Steve she said

Stay right where you are Captain Elisha did not request now he
commanded Stevie stand still Caroline I want to talk to you

The girl hesitated She had never been spoken to in that tone before
Her pride had been already deeply wounded by what she had learned that
afternoon she was fiercely resentful angry and rebellious She was
sure she never hated anyone as she did this man who ordered her to stay
and listen to him Butshe stayed

Caroline said Captain Elisha after a moment of silence I presume
likelyof course I dont know for sartin but I presume likely its
Mrs Dunn and that son of hers whove told you what you think you know

It doesnt concern you who told us blustered Stephen pushing
forward He might have been a fly buzzing on the wall for all the
attention his uncle paid him

I presume likely the Dunns told you Caroline he repeated calmly

His niece met his gaze stubbornly

Well she answered and if they did Wasnt it necessary we should
know it Oh with a shudder of disgust I wish I could make you
understand how ashamed I feelhow _wicked_ and ashamed I feel that
I_I_ should have disgraced fathers memory by Oh but there I
cant Yes Mrs Dunn and Malcolm did tell usmany things Thank God
that we _have_ friends to tell us the truth

Amen quietly Ill say amen to that Caroline any time Only I want
you to be sure those you call friends are real ones and that the truths
they tell aint like the bait on a fishhook put on _for_ bait and just
thick enough to cover the barb

Do you mean to insinuate screamed the irrepressible nephew wild
at being so completely ignored His uncle again paid not the slightest
attention

But that aint neither here nor there now he went on Caroline Mr
Pearson just told you that his coming to this house without tellin you
fust of his quarrel with Bije was his fault That aint so The fault
was mine altogether He told me the whole story told me that he hadnt
called since it happened on that very account And I took the whole
responsibility and _asked_ him to come I did Do you know why

If he expected an answer none was given Carolines lids drooped
disdainfully Steve she said let us go

Stop Youll stay here until I finish I want to say that I didnt tell
you about the Trolley fuss because I wanted you to learn some things for
yourself I wanted you to know Mr Pearsonto find out what sort of man
he was afore you judged him Then when you had known him long enough
to understand he wasnt a liar and a blackguard and all that Steve has
called him I was goin to tell you the whole truth not a part of it
And after that I was goin to let you decide for yourself what to do
Im a lot older than you are Ive mixed with all sorts of folks Im
past the stage where I can be fooled byby false hair or soft soap You
cant pour sweet oil over a herrin and make me believe its a sardine
I know the Pearson stock Ive sailed over a heap of salt water with
one of the family And Ive kept my eyes open since Ive run acrost this
particular member And I knew your father too Caroline Warren And
I say to you now that knowin Jim Pearson and Bije Warrenyes and
knowin the rights and wrongs of that Trolley business quite as well as
Malcolm Dunn or anybody elseI say to you that although Bije was my
brother Id bet my life that Jim had all the right on his side There
thats the truth and no hook underneath it And some day youll realize
it too

He had spoken with great vehemence Now he took a handkerchief from his
pocket and wiped his forehead When he again looked at his niece he
found her staring intently at him and her eyes blazed

Have you quite finishednow she demanded Steve be quiet

Why yes I guess so pretty nigh I spose there aint much use to say
more If I was to tell you that Ive tried to do for you and Steve in
thissame as in everything else since I took this jobas if you
were my own children you wouldnt believe it If I was to tell you
Caroline that Id come to think an awful lot of you you wouldnt
believe that either I did hope that since our other misunderstandin
was cleared up and you found I want what you thought I was youd
come to me and ask questions afore passin judgment but perhaps

And now she interrupted bursting out at him in a blast of scorn which
took his breath away

Oh stop stop she cried Dont say any more You have insulted
fathers memory and defended the man who slandered him Isnt that
enough Why must you go on to prove yourself a greater hypocrite We
learned my brother and I today more than the truth concerning your
_friend_ We learned that you have liedyes liedand

Steady Caroline be careful I wouldnt say what I might be sorry for
later

Sorry Captain Warren you spoke of my misjudging you I thought I had
and I was sorry Today I learned that your attitude in that affair was
a lie like the rest _You_ did not pay for Mr Moriartys accident Mr
Dunns money paid those bills And you allowed the familyand meto
thank _you_ for your generosity Oh Im ashamed to be near you

There There Caroline be still I

I shall not be still I have been still altogether too long You are
our guardian We cant help that I suppose Father asked you to be
that for some reason but did he ask you to _live_ here where you are
not wanted To shame us before our friends ladies and gentlemen so far
above you in every way And to try to poison our minds against them and
sneer at them when they are kind to us and even try to be kind to
you No he did not Oh Im sick of it all your deceit and your
hypocritical speeches and your pretended love for us _Love_ Oh if I
could say something that would make you understand how thoroughly we
despise you and how your presence ever since you forced it upon Steve
and me has disgraced us If I only could II

She had been near to tears ever since Mrs Corcoran Dunn in the
kindness of her heart told her the truth that afternoon But pride
and indignation had prevented her giving way Now however she broke
down

Ohoh Steve she cried and turning to her brother sobbed
hysterically on his shoulder Oh Steve what shall we do

Stephen put his arm about her waist Its all right Sis he said
soothingly Dont cry before _him_ I guess with a glance at his
uncle youve said enough to make even him understandat last

Captain Elisha looked gravely at the pair I guess you have he said
slowly I guess you have Caroline Anyhow I cant think offhand of
anything youve left out I could explain some things but whats the
use And with a sigh you may be right in a way Perhaps I shouldnt
have come here to live If youd only told me plain afore just how you
felt Idmaybe Idbut there I didnt knowI didnt know You see
I thought However I guess that part of your troubles is over But
he added firmly wherever I am or wherever I go you must understand
that Im your guardian just the same I considered a long spell afore I
took the place and I never abandoned a ship yet once I took command of
her And Ill stick to this one Yes sir Ill stick to it in spite of
the devilor the Dunns either Till you and your brother are of age
Im goin to look out for you and your interests and your money and
nothin nor nobody shall stop me As for forcin my company on you
though that well thats different I callate you wont have to worry
any more Good night

He thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly from the library




CHAPTER XIV


Stephen the man of the family was the only member of the household
servants excepted who slept soundly that night Conscious of having
done his duty in the affair with Pearson and his guardian and somewhat
fatigued by the disagreeable task of soothing his hysterical sister he
was slumbering peacefully at nine the next morning when awakened by a
series of raps on his bedroom door

Ah What Well what is it he demanded testily opening his eyes
Edwards is that you What the devil do you mean by making such a row

The voice which answered was not the butlers but Carolines

Steve Oh Steve she cried Do get up and come out Come quick

Whats the matter inquired the young man sitting up in bed Is the
house afire

No no But do come I want you Something has happened

Happened What is it

I cant tell you here Please dress and come to me as quick as you
can

Stephen wondering and somewhat alarmed dressed with unusual
promptitude and obeyed He found his sister standing by the library
window a letter in her hand She looked troubled and anxious

Well Caro observed the boy here I am What in the worlds up now

She turned

Oh Steve she exclaimed hes gone

Gone Who

Captain Warren Hes gone

Gone Gone where Caro you dont mean hes_dead_

No hes gonegone and left us

Her brothers expression changed to incredulous joy

What he shouted You mean hes quit Cleared out Left here for
good

Yes

Hurrah Excuse me while I gloat Hurrah We got it through his skull
at last Is it possible Butbut hold on Perhaps its too good to be
true Are you sure How do you know

He says so See

She handed him the letter It was addressed to My dear Caroline and
in it Captain Elisha stated his intentions succinctly After the plain
speaking of the previous evening he should not of course burden them
with his society any longer He was leaving that morning and as soon
as he located permanent moorings somewhere else would notify his niece
and nephew of his whereabouts

 For he added as I told you although I shall not impose
 my company on you I am your guardian same as ever I will
 see that your allowance comes to you regular including
 enough for all household bills and pay for the hired help and
 so on If you need any extras at any time let me know and if
 they seem to me right and proper I will send money for them
 You will stay where you are Caroline and Stevie must go
 back to college right away Tell him I say so and if he does
 not I shall begin reducing his allowance according as I wrote
 him He will understand what I mean I guess that is all
 until I send you my address and any other sailing orders that
 seem necessary to me then And Caroline I want you and
 Stevie to feel that I am your anchor to windward and when
 you get in a tight place if you ever do you can depend on
 me Last nights talk has no bearing on that whatever
 Goodby then until my next

 ELISHA WARREN

Stephen read this screed to the end then crumpled it in his fist and
threw it angrily on the floor

The nerve he exclaimed He seems to think Im a sailor on one of his
ships to be ordered around as he sees fit Ill go back to college when
Im good and readynot before

Caroline shook her head Oh no she said You must go today Hes
right Steve its the thing for you to do He and I were agreed as to
that And you wouldnt stay and make it harder for me would you dear

He growled a reluctant assent I suppose I shall have to go he said
sullenly My allowance is too beastly small to have him cutting it and
the old shark would do that very thing hed take delight in doing it
confound him Well he knows what we think of him thats some comfort

She did not answer He looked at her curiously

Why hang it all Caro he exclaimed in disgust what ails you
Blessed if I shant begin to believe youre sorry hes gone You act as
if you were

No Im not Of course Im not ImIm glad He couldnt stay of
course But Im afraidI cant help feeling that you and I were too
harsh last night We said thingsdreadful things

Be hanged We didnt say half enough Oh dont be a fool Caro I was
just beginning to be proud of your grit And now you want to take it all
back Honestly girls are the limit You dont know your own minds for
twelve consecutive hours Answer me now _Are_ you sorry hes gone

No No Im not really But II feel somehow as ifas if everything
was on my shoulders Youre going away and hes gone andWhat is it
Edwards

The butler entered with a small parcel in his hand

I beg your pardon Miss Caroline he said I should have given you
this last evening It was by your place at the table I think Captain
Warren put it there miss

Caroline took the parcel and looked at it wonderingly

For me she repeated

Yes Miss Caroline It is marked with your name And breakfast is
served when you and Mr Stephen are ready

He bowed and retired The girl sat turning the little white box in her
hands

_He_ left it for me she said What can it be

Her brother snatched it impatiently

Why dont you open it and find out he demanded Perhaps its his
latch key Here Ill do it myself

He cut the cord and removed the cover of the little box Inside was the
jewelers leather case He took it out and pressed the spring The cover
flew up

Whew he whistled Its a present And rather a decent one too by
gad Look Caro

He handed her the open case She looked at the chain spread carefully
on the white satin lining Inside the cover was fitted a card She
turned it over and read To my niece Caroline With wishes for many
happy returns and much love from her Uncle Elisha Warren

She sat gazing at the card Stephen bent down read the inscription
and then looked up into her face

_What_ he cried I believeYoure not _crying_ Well Ill be
hanged Sis you _are_ a fool

     

The weather that morning was fine and clear James Pearson standing
by the window of his rooms at the boarding house looking out at the
snowcovered roofs sparkling in the sun was miserable When he retired
the night before it was with a solemn oath to forget Caroline Warren
altogether to put her and her father and the young cad her brother
utterly from his mind never to be thought of again As a preliminary
step in this direction he began the moment his head touched the
pillow to review for the fiftieth time the humiliating scene in the
library to think of things he should have said andworse than allto
recall word for word the things she had said to him In this cheerful
occupation he passed hours before falling asleep And when he woke it
was to begin all over again

Why_why_ had he been so weak as to yield to Captain Elishas advice
Why had he not acted like a sensible selfrespecting man done what he
knew was right and persisted in his refusal to visit the Warrens Why
Because he was an idiot of coursea hopeless idiot who had got
exactly what he deserved Which bit of philosophy did not help make his
reflections less bitter

He went down to breakfast when the bell rang but his appetite was
missing and he replied only in monosyllables to the remarks addressed
to him by his fellow boarders Mrs Hepton the landlady noticed the
change

You not ill Mr Pearson I hope she queried I do hope you havent
got cold sleeping with your windows wide open as you say you do Fresh
air is a good thing in moderation but one should be careful Dont you
think so Mr Carson

Mr Carson was a thin little man a bachelor who occupied the smallest
room on the third story He was a clerk in a department store and his
board was generally in arrears Therefore when Mrs Hepton expressed an
opinion he made it a point to agree with her In this instance however
he merely grunted

I say fresh air in ones sleeping room is a good thing in moderation
Dont you think so Mr Carson repeated the landlady

Mr Carson rolled up his napkin and inserted it in the ring His board
as it happened was paid in full to date Also although he had not yet
declared his intention he intended changing lodgings at the end of the
week

Humph he sniffed with sarcasm it may be I couldnt get none in
_my_ room if I wanted it so I cant say sure Morning

He departed hurriedly Mrs Hepton looked disconcerted Mrs Van Winkle
Ruggles smiled meaningly across the table at Miss Sherborne who smiled
back

Mr Ludlow the bookseller quietly observed that he hoped Mr Pearson
had not gotten cold Colds were prevalent at this time of the year
These are the days when the Genius of the weather sits in mournful
meditation on the threshold as Mr Dickens tells us he added I
presume he sits on the sills of open windows also

The wife of the Mr Dickens there present pricked up her ears

When did you write that C dear she asked turning to her husband
I remember it perfectly of course but I have forgotten for the
moment in which of your writings it appears

The illustrious ones mouth being occupied with a section of scorching
hot waffle he was spared the necessity of confession

Pardon me said Mr Ludlow I was not quoting our Mr Dickens this
time but his famous namesake

The great C drowned the waffle with a swallow of water

Maria he snapped dont be so foolish Ludlow quotes
fromerBleak House I have written some thingsersimilar but
not that Why dont you pass the syrup

The bookseller who was under the impression that he had quoted from the
Christmas Carol merely smiled and remained silent

My father the Senator began Mrs Van Winkle Ruggles was troubled
with colds during his political career I remember his saying that the
Senate Chamber at the Capitol was extremely draughty Possibly Mr
Pearsons ailment does come from sleeping in a draught Not that father
was accustomed to _sleep_ during the sessionsOh dear no not that
of course How absurd

She laughed gayly Pearson who seemed to think it time to say
something declared that so far as he knew he had no cold or any
symptoms of one

Well said Mrs Hepton with conviction something ails you I know
We can all see it cant we turning to the rest of the company Why
youve scarcely spoken since you sat down at the table And youve eaten
next to nothing Perhaps there is some trouble something on your mind
which is worrying you Oh I _hope_ not

No doubt it is the preoccupation of genius remarked Mrs Dickens
Im sure it must be that When C is engaged with some particularly
trying literary problem he frequently loses all his appetite and does
not speak for hours together Isnt it so dear

C who was painfully conscious that he might have made a miscue in
the matter of the quotation answered sharply

No he said Not at all Dont be silly Maria

Miss Sherborne clasped her hands _I_ know she exclaimed in mock
rapture Mr Pearson is in love

This suggestion was received with applause and hilarity Pearson pushed
back his chair and rose

Im much obliged for this outburst of sympathy he observed dryly
But as I say Im perfectly well and the other diagnoses are too
flattering to be true Good morning

Back in his room he seated himself at his desk took the manuscript of
his novel from the drawer and sat moodily staring at it He was in no
mood for work The very sight of the typewritten page disgusted him
As he now felt the months spent on the story were time wasted It was
ridiculous for him to attempt such a thing or to believe that he
could carry it through successfully or to dream that he would ever be
anything better than a literary hack a cheap edition of C Dickens
minus the latters colossal selfsatisfaction

He was still sitting there twirling an idle pencil between his fingers
when he heard steps outside his door Someone knocked

Well what is it he asked

His landlady answered

Mr Pearson she said may I see you

He threw down the pencil and rising walked to the door and opened it
Mrs Hepton was waiting in the hall She seemed excited

Mr Pearson she said will you step downstairs with me for a moment
I have a surprise for you

A surprise What sort of a surprise

Oh a pleasant one At least I think it is going to be pleasant for all
of us But Im not going to tell you what it is You must come down and
see for yourself

She led the way downstairs the young man following her wondering what
the surprise might be and fairly certain it nor anything else could
be pleasant on that day

He supposed of course that he must descend to the parlor to reach the
solution of the mystery but he was mistaken On the second floor Mrs
Hepton stopped and pointed

Its in there she said pointing

There was the room formerly occupied by Mr Saks the longhaired
artist Since his departure it had been vacant Pearson looked at the
closed door and then at the lady

A surprise for me in _there_ he repeated Whats the joke Mrs
Hepton

By way of answer she took him by the arm and leading him to the door
threw the latter open

Here he is she said

Hello Jim hailed Captain Elisha Warren cheerfully Ship ahoy Glad
to see you

He was standing in the middle of the room his hat on the table and his
hands in his pockets

Pearson was surprised there was no doubt of thatnot so much at the
sight of his friendhe had expected to see or hear from the captain
before the day was overas at seeing him in that room He could not
understand what he was doing there

Captain Elisha noted his bewildered expression and chuckled

Come aboard Jim he commanded Come in and inspect Ill see you
later Mrs Hepton he added and give you my final word I want to
hold officers council with Mr Pearson here fust

The landlady accepted the broad hint and turned to go

Very well she said but I do hope for all our sakes that word will
be _yes_ Mr WarrenExcuse me it is Captain Warren isnt it

It used to be yes maam And at home it is yet Round here Ive
learned to be like a barroom pollparrot ready to answer to most
everything There as the door closed after her now we can be more
private Set down Jim How are you anyway

Pearson sat down mechanically Im well enougheverything considered
he replied slowly But whatwhat are you in here for I dont
understand

You will in a minute What do you think of thisersaloon cabin
with a comprehensive sweep of his arm

The room was of fair size furnished in a nondescript boardinghouse
fashion and with two windows overlooking the little back yard of
the house and those of the other adjoining it Each yard contained an
assortment of ash cans and there was an astonishing number of clothes
lines each fluttering a variety of garments peculiarly personal to
their respective owners

Pretty snug aint it continued the captain Not exactly up to that
Ive been luxuriatin in lately but more fittin to my build and class
than that was I shouldnt wonder No Corot paintins nor five thousand
dollar tintypes of dory codders but I can manage to worry along without
them if I try hard Neat but not gaudy I call itas the architect
feller said about his plans for the addition to the county jail at
Ostable Hey Ho Ho

Pearson began to get a clue to the situation

Captain Warren he demanded have youDo you mean to say youve
taken this room to _live_ in

No I aint said all that yet I wanted to talk with you a little afore
I said it But that was my idea if you and I agreed on sartin matters

Youve come here to live Youve left youryour nieces house

Yaas Ive left That is I left the way the Irishman left the stable
where they kept the mule He said there was all out doors in front of
him and only two feet behind Thats about the way twas with me

Have your nephew and niece

Umhm They hinted that my room was better than my company and take
it by and large I guess they was right for the present anyhow I set
up till three oclock thinkin it over and then I decided to get out
afore breakfast this mornin I didnt wait for any goodbys Theyd
been said or all I cared to hearCaptain Elishas smile disappeared
for an instantlast evenin The dose was sort of bitter but it had
the necessary effect At any rate I didnt hanker for another one I
remembered what your landlady told me when I was here afore about this
stateroom bein vacated and I come down to look at it It suits me well
enough seems like a decent moorins for an old salt water derelict like
me the price is reasonable and I guess likely Ill take it I _guess_
I will

Why do you guess By George I hope you will

Do you Im much obliged I didnt know but after last night after the
scrape I got you into you might feelwell sort of as if youd seen
enough of me

The young man smiled bitterly It wasnt your fault he said It was
mine entirely Im quite old enough to decide matters for myself and I
should have decided as my reason and not my inclinations told me You
werent to blame

Yes I was If youre old enough Im _too_ old I callate But I did
thinkHowever theres no use goin over that I ask your pardon Jim
And you dont hold any grudge

Indeed I dont I may be a foolI guess I ambut not that kind

Thanks Well theres one objection out of the way then only I dont
want you to think that Ive hove overboard that responsibility I was
so easy and fresh about takin on my shoulders Its there yet and Ill
see you squared with Caroline afore this vyage is over if I live

His friend frowned

You neednt mind he said I prefer that you drop the whole miserable
business

Well maybe butJim youve taken hold of these electric batteries
that doctors have sometimes Its awful easy to grab the handles of one
of those contraptions but when you want to drop em you cant They
dont drop easy I took hold of the handles of Bijes affairs and
though it might be pleasanter to drop em I cantor I wont

Then youre leaving your nephew and niece doesnt mean that youve
given up the guardianship

Captain Elishas jaw set squarely

I dont remember sayin that it did he answered with decision
Then his goodnature returning he added And now Jim Id like your
opinion of these new quarters that I may take What do you think of em
Come to the window and take a look at the scenery

Pearson joined him at the window The captain waved toward the
clotheslines and grinned

Looks as if there was some kind of jubilee dont it he observed
Every craft in sight has strung the colors

Pearson laughed Then he said

Captain I think the room will do It isnt palatial but one can live
in worse quarters as I know from experience

Yup Well Jim theres just one thing more Have I disgraced you a
good deal bein around with you and chummin in with you the way I
have That is do you _think_ Ive disgraced you Are you ashamed of
me

I Ashamed of _you_ Youre joking

No Im serious Understand now Im not apologizin My ways are my
ways and I think theyre just as good as the next fellers whether
hes from South Denboro orwell Broad Street Ive got a habit of
thinkin for myself and actin for myself and when I take off my hat
its to a bigger _man_ than I am and not to a more stylish hat But
since Ive lived here in New York Ive learned that with a whole lot
of folks hats themselves count more than whats underneath em I
havent changed mine and I aint goin to Now with that plain and
understood do you want me to live here in the same house with you I
aint fishin for compliments I want an honest answer

He got it Pearson looked him squarely in the eye

I do he said I like you and I dont care a damn about your hat Is
that plain

Captain Elishas reply was delivered over the balusters in the hall

Hi he called Hi Mrs Hepton

The landlady had been anxiously waiting She ran from the dining room to
the foot of the stairs

Yes she cried What is it

Its a bargain said the captain Im ready to engage passage




CHAPTER XV


Thus Captain Elisha entered another of New Yorks circles that which
centered at Mrs Heptons boarding house Within a week he was as much
a part of it as if he had lived there for years At lunch on the day
of his arrival he made his appearance at the table in company with
Pearson and when the landlady exultantly announced that he was to be
one of our little party thereafter he received and replied to the
welcoming salutations of his fellow boarders with unruffled serenity

How could I help it he asked Human natures liable to temptation
they tell us The flavor of that luncheon we had last time I was here
has been hangin round the edges of my mouth and tantalizin my memory
ever since

We had a souffle that noon if I remember correctly Captain observed
the flattered Mrs Hepton

Did you Well I declare Id have sworn twas a bileddinner hash
Knew twas better than any I ever ate afore but Id have bet twas
hash just the same Tut tut tut Now honest Mrs Hepton aint
thiserwhateveryoucallit a close relationa sort of hash with its
city clothes on hey

The landlady admitted that a souffle was something not unlike a hash
Captain Elisha nodded

I thought so he declared I was sartin sure I couldnt be mistaken
What is it used to be in the song book You can smashyou can Well
I dont remember Somethin about your bein able to smash the vase if
you wanted to but the smell of the posies was there yet

Mr Ludlow the bookseller supplied the quotation

 You may break you may shatter
 The vase if you will
 But the scent of the roses
 Will cling to it still

he said smiling

Thats it Much obliged You can warm up and rechristen the hash if you
will but the corned beef and cabbage stay right on deck Aint that so
Mr Dickens

The illustrious C bowed

Moore he observed with dignity

Yes Thats what _I_ saidMore Said it twice I believe Glad you
agree with me The hymn says that weakness is sin but theres no sin in
havin a weakness for cornedbeef hash

Miss Sherborne and Mrs Van Winkle Ruggles were at first inclined to
snub the new boarder considering him a country boor whose presence in
their select society was almost an insult The captain did not seem to
notice their hints or sneers although Pearson grew red and wrathful

Laura my dear said Mrs Ruggles addressing the teacher of vocal
culture dont you feel quite rural today Almost as if you were
visiting the country

I do indeed replied Miss Sherborne Refreshing isnt it Ha ha

It is if one cares for such things I am afraid _I_ dont appreciate
them They may be well enough in their place but

She finished with a shrug of her shoulders Captain Elisha smiled

Yes maam he said politely joining in the conversation thats
what the boy said about the cooky crumbs in the bed You dont care for
the country I take it maam

I do _not_

So Well its a mercy we dont think alike even Heaven would be
crowded if we didhey You didnt come from the country either
turning to Miss Sherborne

The young lady would have liked to answer with an uncompromising
negative Truth and the fact that some of those present were acquainted
with it compelled her to forego this pleasure

I was born in aa small town she answered coldly But I came to the
city as soon as I possibly could

Umhm Well I came when I couldnt possibly stay away We can agree
on one thingwere all here Yes and on anotherthat that cake
is fustrate Ill take a second piece if youve no objection Mrs
Hepton

When they were alone once more in the captains room Pearson vented
his indignation

Why didnt you give them as good as they sent he demanded Couldnt
you see they were doing their best to hurt your feelings

Yaas I could see it Didnt need any specs to see that

Then why didnt you answer them as they deserved

Oh I dont know Whats the use Theyve got troubles of their own
One of ems a usedtobe and the others a neverwas Either disease
is bad enough without addin complications

Pearson laughed I dont get the whole of that Captain he said
Mrs Van is the usedtobe I suppose But what is it that Miss
Sherborne never was

Married was the prompt reply Old maiditis is creepin on her fast
You want to be careful Jim a certain kind of female gets desperate
about her stage

Pearson laughed again

Oh get out he exclaimed turning to go

All right I will when you and she are together and you give me the
signal But I tell you honest Id hate to do it Judgin by the way she
smiles and looks up under her eyewinkers at you youre in danger
of kidnappin So long Ill see you again after I get my dunnage
unpacked

The snubbing and sneering came to an abrupt end Pearson in
conversation with Mrs Ruggles casually imparted the information that
Captain Elisha was the brother of A Rodgers Warren late society leader
and wealthy broker Also that he had entire charge of the latters
estate Thereafter Mrs Ruggles treated the captain as one whose rank
was equal to her own and consequently higher than anyones else
in the boardinghouse She made it a point to publicly ask his advice
concerning securities and investments and favored him with many
reminiscences of her distinguished father the Senator Miss Sherborne
as usual followed her lead Captain Elisha when Pearson joked him on
the altered behavior of the two ladies merely grinned

You may thank me for that Captain said the young man When I told
Mrs Ruggles who and what you were she almost broke down and sobbed
The fact that she had risked offending one so closely connected with the
real thing on Fifth Avenue and Wall Street was too dreadful But shes
yours devotedly now Theres an 18karat crown on your head

Yup I suppose so Well I aint so sot up with pride over wearin
that crown It used to belong to Bije and I never did care much for
secondhand things Rather have a new souwester of my own any day in
the week When I buy a souwester I know what its made of

Mrs Ruggles knows what the crown is made ofgold nicely padded with
bonds and preferred stock

Humph Sometimes I wonder if the paddins waterproof As for the
goldwell you can make considerble shine with brass when youre
dealin with nighsighted folks  and children

To this indirect reference to Miss Warren and her brother Pearson made
no reply The pair conversed freely on other subjects but each avoided
this one The novel too was laid on the shelf for the present Its
author had not yet mustered sufficient courage to return to it Captain
Elisha once or twice suggested a session with Capn Jim but finding
his suggestions received with more or less indifference did not press
them His mind was busy with other things A hint dropped by Sylvester
the lawyer was one of these It suggested alarming possibilities and
his skepticism concerning the intrinsic worth of his inherited crown
was increased by it

He paid frequent visits to the offices of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves in
Pine Street Upon the senior partner whom he esteemed and trusted not
only as a business adviser but a friend he depended for information
concerning happenings at the Warren apartment

Caroline sent him regular statements of her weekly expenditures also
bills for his approval but she had written him but once and then only
a brief note The note brought by a messenger accompanied a
package containing the chain which he and Pearson selected with such
deliberation and care at the Fifth Avenue jewelers Under the existing
circumstances the girl wrote she felt that she did not wish to accept
presents from him and therefore returned this one He was alone when the
note and package came and sat by the window of his room looking out at
the dismal prospect of back yards and clotheslines turning the leather
case over and over in his hands Perhaps this was the most miserable
afternoon he had spent since his arrival in the city He tried to
comfort himself by the exercise of his usual philosophy but it was cold
comfort He had no right to expect gratitude so he told himself and
the girl undoubtedly felt that she was justified in her treatment of
him but it is hard to be misunderstood and misjudged even by one whose
youth is perhaps an excuse He forgave Caroline but he could not
forgive those who were responsible for her action

After Pearson had departed on the morning when the conversation dealing
with Mrs Van Winkle Ruggles and her change of attitude took place
Captain Elisha put on his hat and coat and started for his lawyers
office Sylvester was glad to see him and invited him to lunch

No thank you replied the captain I just run down to ask if there
was anything new in the offin Last time I see you you hinted you and
your mates had sighted somethin or other through the fog and it might
turn out to be a rock or a lighthouse you couldnt tell which Made up
your mind yet

Sylvester shook his head No he said slowly it is still foggy
Were busy investigating but were not ready to report

Humph Well whats the thing look like You must be a little nigher to
it by now

The lawyer tapped his desk with a pencil I dont know what it looks
like he answered That is to say I dontI cant believe it is what
it appears at this distance to be If it is it is the most

He paused Captain Elisha waited for him to go on and when he did not
do so asked another question

The most what he demanded Is it likely to be very bad

Whywhywell I cant say even that yet But there as I told you
Im not going to permit it to worry me And you mustnt worry either
Thats why I dont give you any further particulars There may be
nothing in it after all

His visitor smiled Say Mr Sylvester he said youre like the
youngones used to be when I was a boy Thered be a gang of em waitin
by the schoolhouse steps and when the particular victim hove in sight
theyd hail him with Ah ha _youre_ goin to get it Wait till
teacher sees you and so on Course the victim would want to know what
it meant All the satisfaction he got from them was Thats all right
Youll find out You just wait And the poor feller put in the time
afore the bell rung goin over all the things he shouldnt have done and
had and wonderin which it was this time You hinted to me a week ago
that there was a surprisin possibility loomin up in Bijes financial
affairs And ever since then Ive been puzzlin my brains tryin to
guess what could happen Aint discovered any more of those Cut Short
bonds have you

The bonds to which he referred were those of a defunct Short Line
railroad A large number of these bonds had been discovered among A
Rodgers Warrens effects part of his tangled assets the captain had
termed them differentiating from the tangible variety

Abbie my housekeeper has been writin me he went on about havin
the sewin room papered She wants my advice concernin the style of
paper says it ought to be pretty and out of the common but not too
expensive I judge what she wants is somethin that looks like money
but aint really wuth more than ten cents a mile Ive been thinkin
Id send her a bale or so of those bonds theyd fill the bill in those
respects wouldnt they

Sylvester laughed They certainly would Captain he replied No
we havent unearthed any more of that sort And as for this mystery of
ours Ill give you the answerif its worth giving at all in a very
short time Meanwhile you go home and forget it

Well Ill try But I guess it sticks out on my face like a four days
toothache But I _wont_ worry about that You know best whether to tell
me now or not andwell Im carryin about all the worry my tonnagell
stand as tis

He drew a long breath Sylvester regarded him sympathetically

You mustnt take your nephews and nieces treatment too much to
heart he said

Oh I dont That is I pretend I dont And I do try not to But I
keep thinkin thinkin and wonderin if twould have been better if I
hadnt gone there to live at all Hi hum a man of my age hadnt ought
to mind what a twentyyearold girl says or does specially when
her kind advisin friends have shown her how shes been deceived and
hypocritted By the way speakin of hypocrites I suppose theres just
as much Dunnin as ever goin on up there

Yes A little more if anything Im afraid Your niece and Mrs Dunn
and her precious son are together now so constantly that people are
expectingwell you know what they expect

I can guess I hope theyll be disappinted

So do I but I must confess Im fearful Malcolm himself isnt so wise
but his mother is

A whole Book of Proverbs hey I know Shes an able old frigate I
did think I had her guns spiked but she turned em on me unexpected I
thought I had her and her boy in a clove hitch I knew somethin that I
was sartin sure they wouldnt want Caroline to know and she and Malcolm
knew I knew it Her tellin Caroline of it _her_ story of it when I
wasnt there to contradict was as smart a piece of maneuverin as ever
was It took the wind out of my sails because though Im just as right
as I ever was Caroline wouldnt listen to me nor believe me now

Shell learn by experience

Yup But learnin by experience is a good deal like shippin green
afore the mast itll make an able seaman of you if it dont kill you
fust When I was a boy there was a man in our town name of Nickerson
Cummins He was mate of a ship and smart as a red pepper poultice on
a skinned heel He was a great churchgoer when he was ashore and always
preachin brotherly love and kindness and pattin us little shavers on
the head and so on Most of the grown folks thought he was a sort of
saint and I thought he was more than that Id have worshiped him
I callate if my Methodist trainin would have allowed me to worship
anybody who want named in Scriptur If thered been an apostle or a
prophet christened Nickerson Id have fell on my knees to this
Cummins man sure So when I went to sea as a cabin boy a towheaded
snubnosed little chap of fourteen I was as happy as a clam at
highwater cause I was goin in the ship he was mate of

He paused There was a frown on his face and his lower jaw was thrust
forward grimly

Well inquired Sylvester What happened

Hey Oh excuse me When I get to thinkin of that vyage I simmer
inside like a teakettle on a hot stove The second day outseasick and
homesick and so miserable I wished I could die all at once instead of
by lingerin spasmsI dropped a dish on the cabin floor and broke it
Cummins was alone with me eatin his dinner and he jumped out of
his chair when I stooped to pick up the pieces and kicked me under the
table When I crawled out he kicked me again and kept it up When his
foot got tired he used his fist There says he between his teeth I
callate thatll learn you that crockery costs money

It did I never broke anything else aboard that ship Cummins was a
bully and a sneak to everybody but the old man and a toady to him He
never struck me or anybody else when the skipper was around but there
was nothin too mean for him to do when he thought he had a safe chance
And he took pains to let me know that if I ever told a soul at home
hed kill me Id learned by experience not only about the price
of crockery but other things things that a youngster ought not to
learnhow to hate a man so that you can wait years to get even with
him for one Im sorry I learned that and dryly so was Cummins
later But I did learn once and for all not to take folks on
trust nor to size em up by their outside or the noise they make in
prayermeetin nor the way they can spread soft soap when they think
its necessary Id learned that and Id learned it early enough to be
of use to me which was a mercy

It was a hard lesson for me he added reflectively but I managed to
come out of it without lettin it bitter my whole life I dont mind so
much Carolines bein down on me Shell know better some day I hope
and if she dontwell Im only a sideissue in her life anyhow hove
in by accident like the section of dog collar in the sassage But I do
hope her learnin by experience wont come too late to save her from 
what shell be awful sorry for by and by

It must declared the lawyer with decision You must see to it
Captain Warren You are her guardian She is absolutely under your
charge She can do nothing of importance unless you consent

Yup Thats sofor one more year just one remember Then shell
be of age and I cant say Boo And her share of Bijes moneyll
be hers too And dont you believe that that fact has slipped Sister
Dunns memory I aint on deck to head her off now if she puts Malcolm
up to gettin Caroline to give her word and Caroline gives itwell
I know my niece Shes honorable and shell stick to her promise if it
runs her on the rocks And Her Majesty Dunn knows that too Therefore
the cat bein away she callates nows the time to make sure of the
cheese

But the cat can come back The song says it did you know

Umhm And got another kick I shouldnt wonder However my clawsll
stay sharp for a year or thereabouts and if it comes to a shindy
therell be some tall scratchin afore I climb a tree Keep a weather
eye on what goes on wont you

I will You can depend on me

I do And say for goodness sakes put me out of my misery regardin
that rock or lighthouse on Bijes chart soons ever you settle which
it is

Certainly And remember dont worry It may be a lighthouse or
nothing at all At all events Ill report very soon




CHAPTER XVI


But in spite of his promise Sylvester did not report during the
following week or the next Meanwhile his client tried his best to
keep the new mystery from troubling his thoughts and succeeded only
partially The captains days and evenings were quiet and monotonous He
borrowed a book or two from Mrs Heptons meager library read walked
a good deal generally along the water front and wrote daily letters to
Miss Baker He and Pearson were together for at least a portion of each
day The author fighting down his dejection and discouragement set
himself resolutely to work once more on the novel and his nautical
adviser was called in for frequent consultation The story however
progressed but slowly There was something lacking Each knew what that
something was but neither named it

One evening Pearson entered the room tenanted by his friend to find the
latter seated beside the table his shoes partially unlaced and a pair
of big slippers ready for putting on

Captain said the visitor you look so comfortable I hate to disturb
you

Captain Elisha redfaced and panting desisted from the unlacing and
straightened in his chair

Whew he puffed Jim your remarks prove that your experience of the
world aint as big as it ought to be When you get to my age and waist
measure youll realize that stoopin over and comfort dont go together
I hope to be comfortable pretty soon but I shant be till them boots
are off Set down The agonyll be over in a minute

Pearson declined to sit Not yet he said And you let those shoes
alone until you hear what Ive got to say A newspaper friend of mine
has sent me two tickets for the opera tonight I want you to go with
me

Captain Elisha was surprised

To the opera he repeated Why thats aa sort of singin theater
aint it

Yes youre fond of music you told me so And Aida is beautiful Come
on it will do us both good

Hum Well I dont know

I do Get ready

The captain looked at his callers evening clothes

What do you mean by gettin ready he asked Youve got on your
regimentals open front and all My uniform is the huntin case kind
fits in better with church sociables and South Denboro notheasters
If I wore one of those vests like yours Abbied make me put on a red
flannel lungprotector to keep from catchin pneumonia And shed think
twas sinful waste besides runnin the risk of spilin a clean biled
shirt so quick Wont I look like an undertaker sittin alongside of
you

Not a bit If it will ease your mind Ill change to a business suit

I dont care You know how I feel we had a little talk about hats a
spell ago you remember If youre willin to take me just as I am
without a plea as the hymntune says why I callate Ill say yes and
go Set down and wait while I get on my ceremonials

He retired to the curtain alcove and Pearson heard him rustling about
evidently making a hurried change of raiment During this process he
talked continuously

Jim he said I aint been to the theater but once since I landed in
New York Then I went to see a play named The Heart of a Sailor Ha
ha that was a great show Ever take it in did you

No I never did

Well youd ought to Its a wonder of its kind I learned more
things about lifesavin and longshore life from that drayma than youd
believe was possible Youd have got some pints for your Capn Jim yarn
from that play you sartin would Yes indeed Way I happened to go to
it was on account of seein a poster on a fence over nigh where that
Moriarty tribe lived The poster pictured a bark ashore on her beam
ends in a sea like those off the Horn On the beach was a whole parcel
of lifesavers firin off rockets and blue lights Keepin the Fourth of
July I judged they was for I couldnt see any other reason The bark
want moren a hundred foot from em and if all hands on board didnt
know they was in trouble by that time then they deserved to drown
Anyhow they want likely to appreciate the celebration Ho ho Well
when I run afoul of that poster I felt I hadnt ought to let anything
like that get away so I hunted up the theaterit want but a little
ways offand got a front seat for that very afternoon

Was it up to the advertising asked Pearson

_Was_ it Hi hum I wish youd been there More special I wished some
of the folks from home had been there for the whole business was
supposed to happen on the Cape and theyd have realized how ignorant we
are about the place we live in The hero was a strappin sixfooter
sort of a combination fisherman and parson seemed so He wore ileskins
in fair weather and went around preachin or defyin folks that provoked
him and makin love to the daughter of a longhaired old relic that
called himself an inventor Oh consarn it

Whats the matter

Dropped my collar button as usual Collar buttons are one of the Old
Harrys pet traps Ill bet their responsible for most as many lapses
from grace as tangled fishlines Where Ow All right I found it
with my bare foot and edge up of course

A series of grunts and shortbreathed exclamations followed indicating
that the sufferer was struggling with a tight collar

Go on commanded Pearson Tell me some more about the play

Hey Oh the play Where was I

You were saying that the heroines father was an inventor

Thats what _he_ said he was though he never furnished any proof His
daughter helped him with his inventions but if shed cut his hair
once in a while twould have been a better way of puttin in the time
cordin to my notion And there was a rich squire who made his money
by speculatin in wickedness and a mortgage andI dont know what
all And those Cape Cod folks and the houses they lived in and the way
they talked Oh dear oh dear I got my moneys wuth that afternoon

What about the wreck How did that happen

Dont know It happened cause it had to be in the play I callate
The mortgage or an invention or somethin was on board the bark and
just naturally took a short cut for home way I figgered it out
But Jim you ought to have seen that hero He peeled off his
ileskinslickerhed kept it on all through the sunshine but now when
twas rainin and rainin and wreckin and thunderin he shed itand
jumped in and saved all hands and the ships cat Twas great business
No wonder the lifesavers set off fireworks And thunder Why say it
never stopped thunderin in that storm except when somebody had to make
a heroic speech then it let up and give em a chance Most considerate
thunder ever I heard And the lightnin and the way the dust flew from
the breakers I was glad I went There appearing fully dressed from
behind the curtains Im ready if you are Did I talk your head off I
ask your pardon but that Heart of a Sailor touched mine I guess I
know I was afraid Id laugh until it stopped beatin And all around the
people were cryin It was enough sight damper amongst the seats than in
those cloth waves

The pair walked over to Broadway boarded a street car and alighted
before the Metropolitan Opera House Pearsons seats were good ones
well down in the orchestra Captain Elisha turned and surveyed the great
interior and the brilliantly garbed audience

Whew he muttered This is considerable of a show in itself Jim
They could put our town hall inside here and the folks on the roof
wouldnt be so high as those in that main skysl gallery up aloft there
Can they see or hear do you think

Oh yes The accepted idea is that they are the real music lovers
_they_ come for the opera itself Some of the others come becausewell
because it is the proper thing

Yes yes I see Thats the real article right over our heads I
suppose

Yes Thats the Diamond Horseshoe

All proper things there hey

Whyeryes I suppose so What makes you ask

Nothing much I was thinking twas better Abbie want along on this
cruise Shed probably want to put an im in front of that proper
I envy those women Jim _they_ didnt have to stop to hunt up collar
buttons did they

He was silent during the first act of the opera When the curtain fell
his companion asked how he liked it

Good singin he replied best I ever heard Do you understand what
they say

No But Im familiar with the story of Aida of course Its a favorite
of mine And the words dont really matter

I suppose not Its the way they say it I had an Irishman workin
round my barn once and Tim Bailey drove down from Bayport to see me I
was out and Tim and the Irishman run afoul of each other Tim stuttered
so that he made a noise when he talked like one of these gasoline
bicycles goin by He watched Mike sweepin out the horse stall and he
says Youre a puppup  I say youre a pup He didnt get any
further cause Mike went for him with the broom Turned out later that
he was tryin to compliment that Irishman by sayin he was a particular
sort of feller These folks on the stage might be sayin most anythin
and I wouldnt know it But I shant knock em down for I like the
way its said When the Almighty give us music he more than made up for
makin us subject to toothache didnt he

Pearson bought a copy of the libretto and the captain followed the
performance of the next two acts with interest

Say Jim he whispered with a broad grin its a good thing this
opera idea aint carried into real life If you had to sing every word
you said twould be sort of distressin specially if you was in a
hurry A fustrate solo when you was orderin the crew to shorten sail
would be a high old brimstone anthem Ill bet you And think of the
dinner table at our boardin house Mrs Van and C Dickens both goin
at once and Marm Hepton serenadin the waiter girl Ho ho A cat fight
wouldnt be a circumstance

Between the third and the fourth acts the pair went out into the foyer
where ascending to the next floor they made the round of the long
curve behind the boxes Pearson pointing out to his friend the names of
the box lessees on the brass plates

There he observed as the half circle completed they turned and
strolled back again isnt that an imposing list Captain Dont you
feel as if you were close to the real thing

Godfreys mighty was the solemn reply I was just thinkin I felt as
if Id been readin one of those muckrakin yarns in the magazines

The foyer had its usual animated crowd and among them Pearson
recognized a critic of his acquaintance He offered to introduce the
captain but the latter declined the honor saying that he callated
he wouldnt shove his bows in this time You heave ahead and see your
friend Jim he added Ill come to anchor by this pillar and watch
the fleet go by Ill have to write Abbie about all this shell want to
know how the female craft was rigged

Left alone he leaned against the pillar and watched the people pass and
repass just behind him Two young men paused just behind him He could
not help overhearing their conversation

I presume youve heard the news asked one casually

Yes replied the other I have That is if you mean the news
concerning Mal Dunn The mater learned it this afternoon and sprung it
at dinner No one was greatly surprised Formal announcement made and
all that sort of thing I believe Mals to be congratulated

His mother is you mean She managed the campaign The old lady is some
strategist and Id back her to win under ordinary circumstances But
I understand these were not ordinary wise owl of a guardian to be
circumvented or something of that sort

From what I hear the Dunns havent won so much after all There was
a big shrinkage when papa died so they say Instead of three or four
millions it panned out to be a good deal less than one I dont know
much about it because our family and theirs have drifted apart since
they moved

Humph I imagine whatever the panout it will be welcome The Dunns are
dangerously close to the ragged edge everybody has been on to that for
some time And it takes a few ducats to keep Mal going Hes no Uncle
Russell when it comes to putting by for the rainy day

Well on the whole Im rather sorry forthe other party Mal is a
good enough fellow and he certainly is a game sport but

They moved on and Captain Elisha heard no more But what he had heard
was quite sufficient He sat through the remainder of the opera in
silence and answered all his friends questions and remarks curtly and
absently

As they stepped into the trolley Pearson bought an evening paper not
the _Planet_ but a dignified sheet which shunned sensationalism
and devoted much space to the doings of the safe sane and
ultrarespectable element Perceiving that his companion for some
reason did not care to talk he read as the car moved downtown
Suddenly Captain Elisha was awakened from his reverie by hearing his
friend utter an exclamation Looking up the captain saw that he was
leaning back in the seat the paper lying unheeded in his lap

Whats the matter asked the older man anxiously

Pearson started glanced quickly at his friend hesitated and looked
down again

Nothingnow he answered brusquely We get out here Come

He rose picked up the paper with a hand that shook a little and led
the way to the door of the car Captain Elisha followed and they
strode up the deserted side street Pearson walked so rapidly that
his companion was hard pushed to keep pace with him When they stood
together in the dimly lit hall of the boarding house the captain spoke
again

Well Jim he asked in a low tone what is it You may as well tell
me Maybe I can guess anyhow

The young man reached up and turned the gas full on In spite of the
cold from which they had just come his face was white He folded the
paper in his hand and with his forefinger pointed to its uppermost
page

There it is he said Read it

Captain Elisha took the paper drew his spectacle case from his pocket
adjusted his glasses and read The item was among those under the head
of Personal and Social It was what he expected The engagement
is today announced of Miss Caroline Warren daughter of the late A
Rodgers Warren the wellknown broker to Mr Malcolm Corcoran Dunn of
Fifth Avenue Miss Warren it will be remembered was one of the most
charming of our seasonbeforelasts debutantes and etc

The captain read the brief item through

Yes he said slowly I see

Pearson looked at him in amazement

You _see_ he repeated YouWhy _Did you know it_

Ive been afraid of it for some time Tonight when you left me alone
there in the quarterdeck of that opera house I happened to hear two
young chaps talkin about it So you might say I knewYes

Good heavens and you can stand there andWhat are you going to do
about it

I dont knowyet

Are you going to permit her to marry that_that_ fellow

Well I aint sartin that I can stop her

My God man Do you realizeand _she_your niecewhy

There there Jim I realize it all I callate Its my business to
realize it

And it isnt mine No of course it isnt youre right there

He turned and strode toward the foot of the stairs

Hold on commanded the captain Hold on Jim Dont you go off haf
cocked When I said twas my business to realize this thing I meant
just that and nothin more I want hintin and you ought to know it
You do know it dont you

The young man paused Yes he answered after an instants struggle
with his feelings yes I do I beg your pardon Captain

All right And heres somethin else I just told you I wasnt sartin I
could stop the marriage Thats the truth But I dont recollect sayin
Id actually hauled down the colors not yet Good night

Good night Captain I shouldnt have misunderstood you of course
But as you know I respected and admired your niece And this thing
hashas

Sort of knocked you on your beam ends I understand Well Jim with a
sigh I aint exactly on an even keel myself

They separated Pearson going to his room As Captain Elisha was passing
through the hall on the second floor he heard someone calling him by
name Turning he saw his landladys head bristling with curl papers
protruding from behind the door at the other end of the passage

Captain Warren she asked is that you

Yes maam replied the captain turning back

Well Ive got a message for you A Mr Sylvester has phoned you
twice this evening He wishes to see you at his office at the earliest
possible moment He says it is _very_ important




CHAPTER XVII


Nine oclock is an early hour for a New York lawyer of prominence to be
at his place of business Yet when Captain Elisha asked the office boy
of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves if the senior partner was in he received
an affirmative answer

Yes sir said Tim respectfully His manner toward the captain had
changed surprisingly since the latters first call Yes sir Mr
Sylvesters in He expects you Ill tell him youre here Sit down and
wait please

Captain Elisha sat down but he did not have to wait long The boy
returned at once and ushered him into the private office Sylvester
welcomed him gravely

You got my message then he said I spent hours last evening chasing
you by phone And I was prepared to begin again this morning

So Thats why youre on deck so early Didnt sleep here did you
Well I callate I know what you want to talk about You aint the only
one that reads the newspapers

The newspapers Great heavens it isnt in the newspapers is it It
cant be

He seemed much perturbed Captain Elisha looked puzzled

Course it is he said But I heard it afore I saw it Perhaps you
think I take it pretty easy Maybe I act as if I did But you expected
it and so did I so we aint exactly surprised And seriously I
realize that its no joke as well as you do But weve got a year to
fight in and now we must plan the campaign I did callate to see
Caroline this mornin Then if I heard from her own lips that twas
actually so I didnt knows I wouldnt drop in and give Sister
CorcoranQueenVictoriaDunn a few plain facts about it not bein a
healthy investment to hurry matters Youre wantin to see me headed me
off and I come here instead

The lawyer looked at him in astonishment

See here Captain Warren he demanded what do you imagine I asked
you to come here for

Why to talk about that miserable engagement sartin Poor girl Ive
been awake haf the night thinkin of the mess shes been led into And
she believes shes happy I suppose

Sylvester shook his head I see he said slowly You would think it
that naturally No Captain it isnt the engagement Its more serious
than that

More serious than_more_ serious Why what on earth Hey Mr
Sylvester has that rocklighthouse business come to somethin after
all

The lawyer nodded It has he replied

I want to know And Id almost forgot it not hearin from you Its
a rock too I judge by the looks of your face Humph Is it very
bad

Im afraid so

The captain pulled his beard Well he said wearily after a moment
I guess likely I can bear it Ive had to bear some things in my time
Anyhow Ill try Heave ahead and get it over with Im ready

Instead of answering Sylvester pushed an electric button on his desk
The office boy answered the ring

Have Mr Kuhn and Mr Graves arrived asked the lawyer

Yes sir Both of them sir

Tell them Captain Warren is here and ask them to join us in the inner
room Remind Mr Graves to bring the papers And Tim remember that
none of us is to be disturbed Do you understand

Yes sir said Tim and departed

Captain Elisha regarded his friend with some dismay

Say he exclaimed this _must_ be serious if it takes the skipper
and both mates to handle it

Sylvester did not smile It is he answered Come

He led the way into the room opening from the rear of his own It was
a large apartment with a long table in the center Mr Kuhn brisk and
businesslike was already there He shook hands with his client As he
did so Graves dignified and precise as ever entered carrying a small
portfolio filled with papers

Mornin Mr Graves said the captain glad to see you even under
such distressin circumstances as the undertaker said to the sick man
Feelin all right again I hope No more colds or nothin like that

No Thank you I am quite well at present

Thats hearty If you and me dont do any more buggy ridin in Cape
Cod typhoons well last a spell yet hey What you got there the death
warrant referring to the portfolio and its contents

Mr Graves evidently did not consider this flippancy worth a reply for
he made none

Sit down gentlemen said Sylvester

The four took chairs at the table Graves untied and opened the
portfolio Captain Elisha looked at his solemn companions and his lips
twitched

Youll excuse me he observed but I feel as if I was goin to
be tried for piracy on the high seas Has the court any objection to
tobacco smoke Im puttin the emphasis strong on the tobacco he
added because this is a cigar you give me yourself Mr Sylvester
last time I was down here

No indeed replied the senior partner Smoke if you wish No one
here has any objection unless it may be Graves

Oh Mr Graves aint He and I fired up together that night we fust
met Hot smoke tasted grateful after all the cold water wed had poured
onto us in that storm Graves is all right Hes a sportin character
like myself Maybe hell jine us Got another cigar in my pocket

But the invitation was declined The sporting character might deign
to relax amid proper and fitting surroundings but not in the sacred
precincts of his office So the captain smoked alone

Well he observed after a few preliminary puffs go on Dont keep
me in suspenders as the feller said Where did the lightnin strike
and whats the damage

Sylvester took a card from his pocket and referred to a penciled
memorandum on its back

Captain Warren he began slowly as you know and as directed by
you my partners here and I have been engaged for months in carefully
going over your brothers effects estimating values tabulating and
sorting his various properties and securities separating the good from
the worthlessand there was as we saw at a glance a surprising amount
of the latter

Umhm interrupted the captain Cut Short bonds and the like of that
I know Excuse me Go on

Yes Precisely And there were many just as valueless But we have been
gradually getting those out of the way and listing and appraising the
remainder It was a tangle Your brothers business methods especially
of late years were decidedly unsystematic and slipshod It may have
been the condition of his health which prevented his attending to them
as he should Or he hesitated slightly it may have been that he was
secretly in great trouble and mental distress At all events the task
has been a hard one for us But largely owing to Graves and his patient
work our report was practically ready a month ago

He paused Captain Elisha who had been listening attentively nodded

Yes he said you told me twas What does the whole thing tot up to
Whats the final figger Mr Graves

The junior partner adjusted his eyeglasses to his thin nose

I have them here he said The list of securities et cetera is
rather long but

Never mind them now Graves interrupted Kuhn The amount roughly
speaking is close to over our original estimate half a million

The captain drew a breath of relief Well he exclaimed thats all
right then aint it Thats no poorhouse pension

Sylvester answered Yes he said thats all right as far as it
goes

Humph Well I callate _I_ could make it go to the end of the route
and then have enough left for a return ticket Say with another look
at the solemn faces of the three what _is_ the row If the estate is
wuth haf a million whats the matter with it

That is what we are here this morning to discuss Captain A month ago
as I said we considered our report practically ready Then we suddenly
happened on the trail of something which upon investigation upset all
our calculations If true it threatened not to mention its effect upon
the estate to prove so distressing and painful to us Rodgers Warrens
friends and legal advisers that we decided not to alarm you his
brother by disclosing our suspicions until we were sure there was no
mistake I did drop you a hint you will remember

I remember _Now_ were comin to the rock

Yes Captain Warren I think perhaps I ought to warn you that what my
partners and I are about to say will shock and hurt you I personally
knew your brother well and respected him as an honorable business man A
lawyer learns not to put too much trust in human nature but I confess
thisthis

He was evidently greatly disturbed Captain Elisha regarding him
intently nodded

I judge its sort of hard for you to go on Mr Sylvester he said
Ill help you all I can You and Mr Kuhn and Mr Graves here have
found out somethin that aint exactly straight in Bijes doins Am I
right

Yes Captain Warren you are

Somethin that dont help his character hey

Yes

Somethins hes done thatswell to speak plain thats crooked

Im afraid theres no doubt of it

Humph The captain frowned His cigar had gone out and he idly
twisted the stump between his fingers Well he said with a sigh
our family genrally speakin has always held its head pretty high
Dad was poor but he prided himself on bein straight as a plumb line
And as for mother she Then looking up quickly he asked Does
anybody outside know about this

No one but ourselvesyet

Yet Is it goin to be necessary for anybody else to know it

We hope not But there is a possibility

I was thinkin about the children

Of course So are we all

Umhm Poor Caroline she put her father on a sort of altar and bowed
down afore him as you might say Any sort of disgrace to his name
would about kill her As for me with another sigh I aint so much
surprised as you might think I know that sounds tough to say about
your own brother but Ive been afraid all along You see Bije always
steered pretty close to the edge of the channel He had ideas about
honesty and fair dealin in business that didnt jibe with mine We
split on just that as I told you Mr Graves when you and I fust met
He got some South Denboro folks to invest money along with him sort of
savins account they figgered it but I found out he was usin it to
speculate with So thats why we had our row I took pains to see that
the money was paid back but he and I never spoke afterwards Fur as my
own money was concerned I hadnt any kick but However Im talkin
too much Go on Mr Sylvester Im ready to hear whatever youve got to
say

Thank you Captain You make it easier for me It seems that your
brothers first step toward wealth and success was taken about nineteen
years ago Then somehow or other probably through a combination
of luck and shrewdness he obtained a grant a concession from the
Brazilian Government the long term lease of a goodsized tract of land
on the upper Amazon It was very valuable because of its rubber trees

Hey Captain Elisha leaned forward Say that again he commanded
sharply

Sylvester repeated his statement He got the concession by paying
twenty thousand dollars to the government of Brazil he continued To
raise the twenty thousand he formed a stock company of two hundred and
fifty shares at one hundred dollars each One hundred of these shares
were in his own name Fifty were in the name of one Thomas A Craven
a clerk at that time in his office Craven was only a dummy however Do
you understand what I mean by a dummy

I can guess Sort of a wooden image that moved when Bije pulled the
strings Like one of these straw directors that clutter up the insurance
companies cordin to the papers Yes yes I understand well enough
Go ahead go ahead

Thats it The fifty shares were in Cravens name but they were
transferred in blank and in Mr Warrens safe Together with his own
hundred they gave him control and a voting majority That much we know
by the records

I see But this rubber concontraption want really wuth anything
was it

Worth anything Captain Warren I give you my word that it was worth
more than all the rest of the investments that your brother made during
his lifetime

_No_ The exclamation was almost a shout

Why yes decidedly more Does that surprise you Captain

Captain Elisha did not answer He was regarding the lawyer with a dazed
expression He breathed heavily

Whats the matter demanded the watchful Kuhn his gaze fixed upon his
clients face Do you know anything

The captain interrupted him Go on he commanded But tell me this
fust What was the name of this rubber concern of Bijes

The Akrae Rubber Company

I see Yes yes Akry hey Well what about it Tell me the
rest

For the first year or two this company did nothing Then in March of
the third year the property was released by Mr Warren to persons in
Para who were to develop and operate The terms of his new lease were
very advantageous Royalties were to be paid on a sliding scale and
from the very first they were large The Akrae Company paid enormous
dividends

Did hey I want to know

Yes In fact for twelve years the companys royalties averaged 50000
yearly

Wheew Captain Elisha whistled Fifty thousand a year he repeated
slowly Bije Bije

Yes And three years ago the Akrae Company sold its lease sold out
completely to the Para people for seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars

Godfreys mighty Well after a moment thats what Id call a
middlin fair profit on a twenty thousand dollar investmentnot to
mention the dividends

Captain Sylvester leaned forward now Captain he repeated it is
that sale and the dividends which are troubling us I told you that the
Akrae Company was organized with two hundred and fifty shares of stock
Your brother held one hundred in his own name and fifty transferred to
him by his dummy Craven What I did not tell you was that there were
another hundred shares held by someone someone who paid ten thousand
dollars for themwe know thatand was therefore entitled to
twofifths of every dollar earned by the company during its existence
and twofifths of the amount received for the sale of the lease So far
as we can find out this stockholder has never received one cent

The effect of this amazing announcement upon the uniniated member of the
council was not as great as the lawyers expected it to be You dont
tell me was his sole comment

Graves broke in impatiently I think Captain Warren he declared
that you probably do not realize what this means Besides proving your
brother dishonest it means that this stockholder whoever he may have
been

Hey Whats that Dont you know who he was

No we do not The name upon the stub of the transfer book has been
scratched out

Captain Elisha looked the speaker in the face then slowly turned his
look upon the other two faces

Scratched out he repeated Who scratched it out

Graves shrugged his shoulders

Yes yes said the captain You dont know but were all entitled to
guess hey Humph

If this person is living began Sylvester it follows that

Hold on a minute I dont know much about corporations of
coursethats more in your line than tis in minebut I want to
ask one question You say this whatdyecallitthis Akrae
thingamajigwas sold out hull canvas and riggin to a crowd in
Brazil Its gone out of business then Its dead

Yes But

Wait Aint it customary when a sale like this is made to turn over
all the stock certificates and all Sometimes you get stock in the new
company in exchange I know that But to complete the trade wouldnt
this extry hundred shares be turned in Or some sharp questionin done
if twant

He addressed the query to Sylvester The latter seemed more troubled
than before

That he said with some hesitation is one of the delicate points in
this talk of ours Captain Warren A certificate for the missing hundred
shares _was_ turned in It was dated at the time of the original issue
made out in the name of one Edward Bradley and transferred on the back
by him to your brother That is it was presumably so transferred

Presumably Presumably You mean

I mean that this certificate iswell let us say rather queer To
begin with no one knows who this Bradley is or was His name appears
nowhere except on that certificate unless of course it did appear on
the stub where the scratching has been done we doubt that for reasons
Nobody ever heard of the man and his transfer to your brother was made
and the certificate signed by him only three years ago when the Akrae
Company sold out It will take too long to go into details but thanks
to the kindness of the Para concern which has offices in this citywe
have been able to examine this Bradley certificate Experts have
examined it also And they tell us

He paused

Well what do they tell demanded the captain

They tell us thatthat in their opinion the certificate was never
issued at the time when by this date it presumes to have been It was
made out no longer ago than five years probably less The signature of
Bradley on the back isiswell I hate to say it Captain Warren but
the handwriting on that signature resembles very closely that of your
brother

Captain Elisha was silent for some moments The others did not speak
but waited Even Graves between whom and his client there was little in
common felt the general sympathy

At length the captain raised his head

Well he said slowly we aint children We might as well call things
by their right names Bije forged that certificate

Im afraid there is no doubt of it

Dear dear dear Why they put folks in states prison for that

Yes But a dead man is beyond prisons

Thats so Then I dont see

You will You dont grasp the full meaning of this affair even yet If
the Bradley certificate is a forgery a fraud from beginning to end
then the presumption is that there was never any such person as Bradley
But _someone_ paid ten thousand dollars for one hundred Akrae shares
when the company was formed _That_ certificate has never been turned
in Some person or persons somewhere hold one hundred shares of Akrae
Rubber Company stock Think now Suppose that someone turns up and
demands all that he has been cheated out of for the past seventeen
years Think of that

Well  I am thinkin of it I got the scent of what you was drivin
at five minutes ago And I dont see that we need to be afraid He could
have put Bije in jail but Bije is already servin a longer sentence
than he could give him So that disgrace aint bearin down on us
And if I understand about such things his claim is against the Akrae
Company and thats deaddead as the man that started it Maybe he
could put in a keeper or a receiver or some such critter but theres
nothin left to keep or receive Aint I right

You are Or you would be but for one thing the really inexplicable
thing in this whole miserable affair Your brother Captain Warren was
dishonest He took money that didnt belong to him and he forged that
certificate But he must have intended to make restitution He must have
been consciencestricken and more to be pitied perhaps than condemned
No doubt when he first began to withhold the dividends and use the
money which was not his he intended merely to borrow He was always
optimistic and always plunging in desperate and sometimes rather shady
speculations which he was sure would turn out favorably If they
hadif for instance the South Shore Trolley Combine had been put
throughYou knew of that did you

Ive been told somethin about it Go on

Well it was not put through so his hopes there were frustrated And
that was but one of his schemes However when the sale of the Company
was consummated he did an extraordinary thing He made out and signed
his personal note payable to the Akrae Company for every cent he had
misappropriated And we found that note in his safe after his death
That was what first aroused our suspicions _Now_ Captain Warren do
you understand

Captain Elisha did not understand that was evident His look of
wondering amazement traveled from one face to the others about the
table

A _note_ he repeated Bije put his _note_ in the safe A note
promisin to pay all hed stole And left it there where it could be
found Why thats pretty nigh unbelievable Mr Sylvester He might
just as well have confessed his crookedness and be done with it

Yes It is unbelievable but it is true Graves can show you the note

The junior partner produced a slip of paper from the portfolio and
regarded it frowningly

Of all the pieces of sheer lunacy he observed that ever came under
my observation this is the worst Here it is Captain Warren

He extended the paper Captain Elisha waved it aside

I dont want to see itnot yet he protested I want to think I
want to get at the reason if I can Why did he do it

That is what weve been tryin to findthe reason remarked Kuhn
and we can only guess Sylvester has told you the guess Rodgers Warren
intended or hoped to make restitution before he died

Yes Knowin Bije I can see that He was weak that was his main
trouble He didnt mean to be crooked but his knees want strong
enough to keep him straight when it come to a hard push But he made his
note payable to a Company that was already sold out so it aint good
for nothin Now why

Graves struck the table with his open hand

He doesnt understand at all he exclaimed impatiently Captain
Warren listen That note is made payable to the Akrae Company
Against that company some unknown stockholder has an apparent claim
for twofifths of all dividends ever paid and twofifths of the seven
hundred and fifty thousand received for the sale With accrued interest
that claim amounts to over five hundred thousand dollars

Yes but

That note binds Rodgers Warrens estate to pay that claim His own
personal estate And that estate is not worth over four hundred and
sixty thousand dollars If this stockholder should appear and press his
claim _your brothers children would be not only penniless but thirty
thousand dollars in debt_ There I think that is plain enough

He leaned back grimly satisfied with the effect of his statement
Captain Elisha stared straight before him unseeingly the color fading
from his cheeks Then he put both elbows on the table and covered his
face with his hands

You see Captain said Sylvester gently how very serious the
situation is Graves has put it bluntly but what he says is literally
true If your brother had deliberately planned to hand his children over
to the mercy of that missing stockholder he couldnt have done it more
completely

Slowly the captain raised his head His expression was a strange one
agitated and shocked but with a curious look of relief almost of
triumph

At last he said solemnly At last Now its _all_ plain

All repeated Sylvester You mean

I mean everything all thats been puzzlin me and troublin my head
since the very beginnin All of it _Now_ I know why Oh Bije Bije
Bije

Kuhn spoke quickly

Captain he said I believe you know who the owner of that one
hundred shares is Do you

Captain Elisha gravely nodded

Yes he answered I know him

What

You do

Who is it

The questions were blurted out together The captain looked at the three
excited faces He hesitated and then taking the stub of a pencil from
his pocket drew toward him a memorandum pad lying on the table and
wrote a line upon the uppermost sheet Tearing off the page he tossed
it to Sylvester

Thats the name he said




CHAPTER XVIII


Two more hours passed before the lawyers and their client rose from
their seats about the long table Even then the consultation was not at
an end Sylvester and the Captain lunched together at the Central Club
and sat in the smoking room until after four talking earnestly When
they parted the attorney was grave and troubled

All right Captain Warren he said Ill do it And you may be right
I certainly hope you are But I must confess I dont look forward to my
task with pleasure I think Ive got the roughest end

Itll be rough theres no doubt about that Rough for all hands I
guess And I hope you understand Mr Sylvester that there aint many
men Id trust to do what I ask you to I appreciate your doin it moren
I can tell you Be asas gentle as you can wont you

I will You can depend upon that

I do And I shant forget it Goodby till the next time

They shook hands Captain Elisha returned to the boarding house where
he found a letter awaiting him It was from Caroline telling him of her
engagement to Malcolm Dunn She wrote that while not recognizing his
right to interfere in any way she felt that perhaps he should know
of her action He did not go down to supper and when Pearson came to
inquire the reason excused himself pleading a late luncheon and no
appetite He guessed he would turn in early so he said It was a poor
guess

Next morning he went uptown Edwards opening the door of the Warren
apartment was surprised to find who had rung the bell

Mornin Commodore hailed the captain as casually as if he were
merely returning from a stroll Is Miss Caroline aboard ship

Whywhy I dont know sir Ill see

Thats all right Shes aboard or you wouldnt have to see You and me
sailed together quite a spell so I know your little habits Ill wait
in the library Commodore Tell her theres no particular hurry

His niece was expecting him She had anticipated his visit and was
prepared for it From the emotion caused by his departure after the
eventful birthday she had entirely recovered or thought she had The
surprise and shock of his leaving and the consequent sense of loneliness
and responsibility overcame her at the time but Stephens ridicule and
Mrs Corcoran Dunns congratulations on riddance from the encumbrance
shamed her and stilled the reproaches of her conscience Mrs Dunn
as always played the diplomat and mingled just the proper quantity of
comprehending sympathy with the congratulations

I understand exactly how you feel my dear she said You have a
tender heart and it pains you to hurt anyones feelings no matter how
much they deserve to be hurt Every time I dismiss an incompetent
or dishonest servant I feel that I have done wrong sometimes I cry
actually shed tears you know and yet my reason tells me I am right
You feel that you may have been too harsh with that guardian of yours
You remember what you said to him and forget how hypocritically he
behaved toward you I cant forgive him that I may forget how he
misrepresented Malcolm and me to youthat I may even pardon in
timebut to deceive his own brothers children and introduce into their
society a creature who had slandered and maligned their father_that_
I never shall forget or forgive Andyoull excuse my frankness
dearyou should never forget or forgive it either You have nothing
with which to reproach yourself You were a brave girl and if you are
not proud of yourself _I_ am proud of you

So when her uncle was announced Caroline was ready She entered the
library and acknowledged his greeting with a distant bow He regarded
her kindly but his manner was grave

Well Caroline he began I got your letter

Yes I presumed you did

Umhm I got it It didnt surprise me what you wrote because Id
seen the news in the papers but I was hopin youd tell me yourself
and Im real glad you did Im much obliged to you

She had not expected him to take this tone and it embarrassed her

II gave you my reasons for writing she said Although I do not
consider that I am in any sense duty bound to refer matters other
than financial to you and although my feelings toward you have not
changedstill you are my guardian andand

I understand So youre really engaged

Yes

Engaged to Mr Dunn

Yes

And youre callatin to marry him

One might almost take that for granted impatiently

Almostyes Not always but generally I will give in Youre goin to
marry Malcolm Dunn Why

Why she repeated the question as if she doubted his sanity

Yes Be as patient with me as you can Caroline I aint askin these
things without what seems to me a good reason Why are you goin to
marry him

Why because I choose I suppose

Umhm Are you sure of that

Am I sure indignantly What do you mean

I mean are you sure that its because you choose or because _he_ does
or maybe because his mother does

She turned angrily away If you came here to insult me she began He
interrupted her

No no he protested gently Insultin you is the last thing I want
to do But as your father did put you in my charge I want you to bear
with me while we talk this over together Remember Caroline I aint
bothered you a great deal lately I shouldnt now if I hadnt thought
twas necessary So please dont get mad but answer me this Do you
care for this man youve promised to marry

This was a plain question It should have been answered without the
slightest hesitation Moreover the girl had expected him to ask it
Yet for a moment she did hesitate

I mean continued Captain Elisha do you care for him _enough_
Enough to live with him all your life and see him every day and be to
him what a true wife ought to be See him not with his company manners
on or in his automobile but at the breakfast table and when he comes
home tired and cross maybe When youve got to be forbearin and
forgivin and

He is one of my oldest and best friends she interrupted Her uncle
went on without waiting for her to end the sentence

I know he said One of the oldest thats sure But friendship
cordin to my notion is somethin so small in comparison that it
hardly counts in the manifest Married folks ought to be friends sartin
sure but they ought to be a whole lot moren that Im an old bach you
say and aint had no experience Thats true but Ive been young and
there was a time when _I_ made plans However she died and it never
come to nothin But I _know_ what it means to be engaged the right
kind of engagement It means that you dont count yourself at all not a
bit Youre ready each of you to give up all youve gotyour wishes
comfort money and what itll buy and your life if it should come to
that for that other one Do you care for Malcolm Dunn like that
Caroline

She answered defiantly

Yes I do she said

You do Well do you think he feels the same way about you

Yes with not quite the same promptness but still defiantly

You feel sartin of it do you

She stamped her foot Yes yes _Yes_ she cried Oh _do_ say what
you came to say and end it

Her uncle rose to his feet

Why I guess likely Ive said it he observed When two people care
for each other like that they _ought_ to be married and the sooner the
better I knew that youd been lonesome and troubled maybe and some
of the friends you used to have had kind of dropped awaybusy with
other affairs which is natural enoughand you needin sympathy and
companionship I was sort of worried for fear all this had influenced
you moren it ought to and youd been led into sayin yes without
realizin what it meant But you tell me that aint so you do realize
So all I can say is that Im awful glad for you God bless you my dear
I hope youll be as happy as the day is long

His niece gazed at him bewildered and incredulous This she had _not_
expected

Thank you she stammered I did not knowI thought

Of course you didof course Well then Caroline I guess thats all
I wont trouble you any longer Goodby

He turned toward the door but stopped hesitated and turned back
again

There is just one thing more he said solemnly I dont knows I
ought to speak butI want toand Im goin to And I want you to
believe it I do want you to

He was so earnest and the look he gave her was so strange that she
began to be alarmed

What is it she demanded

Whywhy just this Caroline This is a tough old world we live in
Things dont always go on in it as we think theyd ought to Trouble
comes to everybody and when it all looks right sometimes it turns out
to be all wrong Ifif there should come a time like that to you and
Steve I want you to remember that youve got me to turn to No matter
what you think of me what folks have made you think of me just
remember that Im waitin and ready to help you all I can Any time Im
readyand glad Just remember that wont you because Well there
Goodby Goodby

He hurried away She stood gazing after him astonished a little
frightened and not a little disturbed and touched His emotion was so
evident his attitude toward her engagement was so different from that
which she had anticipated and there was something in his manner which
she could not understand He had acted as if he pitied her Why It
could not be because she was to marry Malcolm Dunn If it were that she
resented his pity of course But it could not be that because he had
given her his blessing What was it Was there something else something
that she did not know and he did Why was he so kind and forbearing and
patient

All her old doubts and questionings returned She had resolutely kept
them from her thoughts but they had been there in the background
always When after the long siege she had at last yielded and said
yes to Malcolm she felt that that question at least was settled She
would marry him He was one whom she had known all her life the son of
the dearest friend she had he and his mother had been faithful at the
time when she needed friends As her husband he would protect her and
give her the affection and companionship she craved He might appear
careless and indifferent at times but that was merely his manner Had
not Mrs Dunn told her over and over again what a good son he was and
what a kind heart he had and how he worshiped her Oh she ought to be
a very happy girl Of course she was happy But why had her uncle looked
at her as he did And what did he mean by hinting that when things
looked right they sometimes were all wrong She wished Malcolm was with
her then she needed him

She heard the clang of the elevator door Then the bell rang furiously
She heard Edwards hasten to answer it Then to her amazement she heard
her brothers voice

Caroline demanded Stephen Caroline Where are you

He burst into the room still wearing his coat and hat and carrying a
traveling bag in his hand

Why Steve she said going toward him Why Steve what

He was very much excited

Oh he exclaimed youre all right then You are all right arent
you

All right Why shouldnt I be all right What do you mean And why are
you here

He returned her look of surprise with one of great astonishment

Why am I here he repeated

Yes Why did you come from New Haven

Why because I got the telegram of course You expected me to come
didnt you

_I_ expected you Telegram What telegram

Why theGood Lord Caro what are you talking about Didnt you know
they telegraphed me to come home at once Ive pretty nearly broke my
neck and the taxicab mans getting here from the station I thought
you must be very ill or something worse

They telegraphed you to come here Who Edwards you may take Mr
Warrens things to his room

But Sis

Just a moment Steve Give Edwards your coat and hat Yes and your
bag That will be all Edwards We shant need you

When they were alone she turned again to her brother

Now Steve she said sit down and tell me what you mean Who
telegraphed you

Why old Sylvester fathers lawyer Ive got the message here
somewhere No never mind Ive lost it I guess He wired me to come
home as early as possible this morning Said it was very important And
you didnt know anything about it

No not a thing What can it mean

_I_ dont know Thats the bell isnt it Edwards

But the butler was already on his way to the door A moment later he
returned

Mr Sylvester he announced

     

Captain Elisha scarcely left his room except for meals during the
remainder of that day and for two days thereafter He was unusually
silent at table and avoided conversation even with Pearson who was
depressed and gloomy and made no attempt to force his society upon
his friend Once passing the door of the latters room he heard the
captain pacing back and forth as if he were walking the quarterdeck of
one of his old ships As Pearson stood listening the footsteps ceased
silence then a deep sigh and they began again The young man sighed
in sympathy and wearily climbed to his den The prospect of chimneys
and roofs across the way was never more desolate or more pregnant with
discouragement

Several times Captain Elisha descended to the closet where the telephone
was fastened to the wall and held long conversations with someone Mrs
Hepton who knew that her newest boarder was anxious and disturbed and
was very curious to learn the reason made it a point to be busy near
that closet while these conversations took place but as the captain
was always careful to close the door she was disappointed Once the
mysterious Mr Sylvester called up and asked for Captain Warren and
the landlady hastened with the summons

I hope its nothing serious she observed feelingly

Yes maam replied the captain on his way to the stairs Much
obliged

It is the same person who was so very anxious to get you the other
night she continued making desperate efforts not to be left behind in
the descent I declare he quite frightened me Andyoull excuse
me Captain Warren but I take such a real friendly interest in my
boardersyou have seemed to me ratherrather upset lately and I _do_
hope it isnt bad news

Well I tell you maam was the unsatisfactory answer given just
before the closet door closed well do the way the poor relation
did when he got word his uncle had willed him one of his suits of
clotheswell hope for the best

Sylvester had a report to make

The other party has been here he said He has just gone

The other party Whyyou dont mean_him_

Yes

Was he alone Nobody along to look after him

He was alone for a wonder He had heard the news too Apparently had
just learned it

He had I want to know Who told him

He didnt say He was very much agitated Wouldnt say anything except
to ask if it was true I think we can guess who told him

Maybe Well what did you say

Nothing of importance I refused to discuss my clients affairs

Right you are How did he take that

He went up like a skyrocket Said he had a right to know under the
circumstances I admitted it but said I could tell him nothingyet He
went away frantic and I called you

Umhm Well Mr Sylvester suppose you do see him and his boss See
em and tell em some of the truth Dont tell too much though not who
was to blame nor how but just that it looks pretty bad so fur as the
estates concerned Then say you want to see em again and will arrange
another interview Dont set any time and place for that until you hear
from me Understand

I think so partially But

Until you hear from methats the important part And if you can
convenient Id have the fust interview right off this afternoon if
its possible

Captain what have you got up your sleeve Why dont you come down here
and talk it over

Cause Im stickin close aboard and waitin developments Maybe there
wont be any but Im goin to wait a spell and see There aint much up
my sleeve just now but gooseflesh theres plenty of that So long

A development came that evening Mrs Hepton heralded it

Captain she said when he answered her knock theres a young
gentleman to see you I think he must be a relative of yours His name
is Warren

Captain Elisha pulled his beard A young _gentleman_ he repeated

Yes I showed him into the parlor There will be no one there but you
and he and I thought it would be more comfortable

Umhm I see Well I guess youd better send him up This is
comfortable enough and there wont be nobody but him and me here
eitherand Ill be more sartin of it

The landlady who considered herself snubbed flounced away Captain
Elisha stepped to the head of the stairs

Come right up Steve he called

Stephen came His uncle ushered him into the room closed the door and
turned the key

Stevie he said kindly Im glad to see you Take off your things
and set down

The boy accepted the invitation only to the extent of throwing his hat
on the table He did not sit or remove his overcoat He was pale his
eyes were swollen and red his hair was disarranged and in all respects
he looked unlike his usual blase and immaculate self His forehead was
wet showing that he had hurried on his way to the boarding house

The captain regarded him pityingly

Set down Stevie he urged Youre all het up and worn out

His nephew paid no attention Instead he asked a question

You know about it he demanded

Yes Stevie I know

You do II mean about thethe Akrae Company andand all

Yes I know all about all of it Do set down

Stephen struck his closed fist into the palm of his other hand He wore
one glove What had become of the other he could not have told

You do he shouted You do By gad Then do you know what it means

Yes I know that too Now Stevie be a good boy and set down and keep
cool Yes I want you to

He put his hands on his nephews shoulders and forced him into a chair

Now just calm yourself urged the captain There aint a mite of
use workin yourself up this way I know the whole business and I cant
tell youI cant begin to tell you how sorry I feel for you Yet you
mustnt give up the ship because

Mustnt give up Stephen was on his feet again Why what are you
talking about I thought you said you knew Do you think that losing
every cent youve got in the world is a _joke_ Do you think thatSee
here do you know who this shareholder is this fellow whos going to
rob us of all we own Who is he

Didnt Mr Sylvester tell you

He said that there was such a man and that he had the estate cinched
He told us about that note and all the rest But he wouldnt tell the
mans name Said he had been forbidden to mention it Do you know him
What sort of fellow is he Dont you think he could be reasoned with
Hasnt he got any decencyor pityor

He choked and the tears rushed to his eyes He wiped them angrily away
with the back of his glove

Its a crime he cried Cant he be held off somehow Who _is_ he I
want to know his name

Captain Elisha sadly shook his head Im afraid he cant Stevie he
said Hes got a legal right to all Bije left and more too It
may be he wont be too hard perhaps hell  but there hastily I
mustnt say that Weve got to face the situation as tis And I
cant tell you his name because he dont want it mentioned unless its
absolutely necessary And we dont either We dont wantany of usto
have this get into the papers We mustnt have any disgrace

Disgrace Good heavens Isnt there disgrace enough already Isnt
it enough to know father was a crook as well as an idiot Ive always
thought he was insane ever since that crazy will of his came to light
but to steal and then to leave a paper proving it so that weve got to
lose everything His children Its

Now hold on boy Your dad didnt mean to take what didnt belong to
himfor good that is the note proves that He did do wrong and used
another mans money but

Then why didnt he keep it If youre going to steal steal like a man
I say

Steve Steve steady now The captains tone was sterner Dont speak
that way Youll be sorry for it later I tell you I dont condemn your
father haf so much as I pity him

Oh shut up You make me sick You talk just as Caro does Ill never
forgive him no matter how much she preaches and I told her so Pity
Pity him How about pity for _me_ II

His overwrought nerves gave way and throwing himself into the chair
he broke down completely and forgetting the manhood of which he was so
fond of boasting cried like a baby Captain Elisha turned away to hide
his own emotion

Its hard he said slowly Its awfully hard for you my boy I hate
to see you suffer this way Then in a lower tone he added doubtfully
I wonder ififI wonder

His nephew heard the word and interrupted

You wonder he demanded hysterically you wonder what What are you
going to do about it Its up to you isnt it Youre our guardian
arent you

Yes Stevie Im your guardian

Yes you are But no one would guess it When we didnt want you you
wouldnt leave us for a minute Now when we need you when there isnt
a soul for us to turn to you stay away You havent been near us Its
up to you I say and what are you going to do about it What are you
going to _do_

His uncle held up his hand

Sshh he said Dont raise your voice like that son I can hear you
without that and we dont want anybody else to hear What am I goin to
do Stevie I dont know exactly I aint made up my mind yet

Well its time you did

Yes I guess likely tis As for my not comin to see you you know the
reason for that Id have come quick enough but I want sure Id
be welcome And I told your sister only tother day thatby the way
Steve how is she How is Caroline

Shes a fool The boy sprang up again and shook his fist Shes the
one Ive come here to speak about If we dont stop her shell ruin us
altogether Sheshes a damned fool I tell you

There there the captains tone was sharp and emphatic Thats
enough of that he said I dont want to hear you call your sister
names What do you mean by it

I mean what I say She _is_ a fool Do you know what shes done Shes
written Mal Dunn all about it Id have stopped her but I didnt know
until it was too late Shes told him the whole thing

She has About Bije

Well perhaps she didnt tell him father was a thief but she did tell
that the estate was gonethat we were flat broke and worse

Hum Captain Elisha seemed more gratified than displeased Hum
Well I kind of expected she would Knowin her I kind of expected it

You did Stephen glared in wrathful amazement You expected it

Yes What of it

What _of_ it Why everything Cant you see Mals our only chance If
she marries him shell be looked out for and so will I She neednt have
told him until they were married The wedding could have been hurried
along the Dunns were crazy to have it as soon as possible Now

Hold on Steve Belay What difference does her tellin him make Maybe
she hasnt mentioned it to you but I had a talk with your sister the
other mornin She thinks the world of Malcolm and he does of her She
told me so herself Of _course_ shed go to him in her trouble And
hell be proudyes and glad to know that he can help her As for the
weddin I dont see that thisll have any effect except to hurry it up
a little more maybe

Steve looked at him suspiciously but there was no trace of sarcasm in
the captains face or voice The boy scowled

Ugh he grunted

Whats the ugh for See here you aint hintin that young Dunn was
callatin to marry Caroline just for her money are you Of course you
aint Why you and he are the thickest sort of chums You wouldnt chum
with a feller who would play such a trick as that on your own sister

Stephens scowl deepened He thrust his hands into his pocket and
shifted his feet uneasily

You dont understand he said People dont do things here as they do
where you come from

I understand that all right with dry emphasis Ive been here long
enough to understand that But maybe I dont understand _you_ Heave
ahead and make it plain

Wellwell thenI mean this I dont know that Mal was after Caros
money butbut he had a right to expect _some_ If he didnt why then
her not telling him until after they were married wouldnt have made
any difference Andand if her tellin him beforehand _should_ make a
difference and he wanted to break the engagement shes just romantic
fool enough to let him

Well

_Well_ If she doesnt marry him whos going to take care of her
Whats going to become of _me_ We havent a cent What kind of a
guardian are you Do you want us to starve

He was shouting again The captain was calm Oh he said I guess
it wont reach to the starvation point Im a pretty tough old critter
cordin to your estimate but I shouldnt let my brothers children
starve If the wust comes to the wust theres always a home and plenty
to eat for you both at South Denboro

This offer did not appear to comfort the young gentleman greatly His
disgust was evident

South Denboro he repeated scornfully Gad South Denboro

Yup But well let South Denboro alone for now and stick to New York
What is it you expect me to do What are you drivin at

Stephen shook a forefinger in his guardians face

I expect you to make her stick to her engagement he cried And make
her make him stick She can cant she Its been announced hasnt it
Everybody knows of it Shes got the rightthe legal right to hold him
hasnt she

His uncle regarded him with a quizzical smile Why yees he
answered I callate she has maybe Course theres no danger of his
wantin to do such a thing but if he should I presume likely we could
make it uncomfortable for him anyhow What are you hankerin for
Stevea breachofpromise suit Ive always understood those sort of
cases were kind of unpleasantfor everybody but the newspapers

The boy was in deadly earnest Pleasant he repeated Is any of this
business pleasant You make her act like a sensible girl Youre her
guardian and you make her And after that if he tries to hedge you
tell him a few things You can hold him Do it _Do_ it

Captain Elisha turned on his heel and began pacing up and down the room
His nephew watched him eagerly

Well he demanded after a moment what are we going to do Are we
going to make him make good

The captain paused Steve he answered deliberately I aint sure as
we are And as Ive said if hes got a spark of decency it wont be
necessary for us to try If it should beif it should be

Well _if_ it should be

Then we can try thats all Maybe you run a course a little different
from me Stevie you navigate cordin to your ideas and I do by mine
But in some ways we aint so fur apart Son with a grim nod you rest
easy on one thingthe Corcoran Dunn fleet is goin to show its colors




CHAPTER XIX


Caroline sat by the library window her chin in her hand drearily
watching the sleet as it beat against the panes and the tops of the
Park trees lashing in the wind Below in the street the trolleys
passed in their neverending procession the limousines and cabs whizzed
forlornly by and the few pedestrians pushed dripping umbrellas against
the gale A wet depressing afternoon as hopeless as her thoughts and
growing darker and more miserable hourly

Stephen standing by the fire kicked the logs together and sent a
shower of sparks flying

Oh say something Caro do he snapped testily Dont sit there
glowering you give me the horrors

She roused from her reverie turned and tried to smile

What shall I say she asked

I dont know But say something for heavens sake Talk about the
weather if you cant think of anything more original

The weather isnt a very bright subject just now

I didnt say it was but its _a_ subject I hope to goodness it
doesnt prevent Sylvesters keeping his appointment Hes late as it
is

Is he wearily I hadnt noticed

Of course you hadnt You dont notice anything It doesnt help
matters to pull a long face and go moping around wiping your eyes
Youve got to use philosophy in times like this Its just as hard for
me as it is for you and I try to make the best of it dont I

She might have reminded him that his philosophy was a very recent
acquisition When the news of their poverty first came he was the one
who raved and sobbed and refused to contemplate anything less direful
than slow starvation or quick suicide She had soothed and comforted
then Since the previous evening when he had gone out in spite of her
protestations and left her alone his manner had changed He was still
nervous and irritable but no longer threatened selfdestruction and
seemed for some unexplained reason more hopeful and less desperate
Sylvester had phoned saying that he would call at the apartment at
two and since Stephen had received the message he had been in a state
of suppressed excitement scarcely keeping still for five minutes at a
time

It is just as hard for me as it is for you isnt it he repeated

Yes Steve I suppose it is

You suppose Dont you know Oh do quit thinking about Mal Dunn and
pay attention to me

She did not answer He regarded her with disgust

You are thinking of Mal of course he declared Whats the use You
know what _I_ think you were a fool to write him that letter

Dont Steve please dont

Ugh

Dont you know he didnt get the letter I was so nervous and
overwrought that I misdirected it

Pooh Has he ever stayed away from you so long before Or his precious
mother either Why doesnt she come to see you She scarcely missed a
day before this happened Nonsense I guess he got it all right

Steve stop stop Dont dare speak like that Do you realize what you
are insinuating You dont believe it You know you dont Shame on you
Im ashamed of my brother No not another word of that kind or I shall
leave the room

She had risen to her feet He looked at her determined face and turned
away

Oh well he muttered sullenly maybe youre right I dont say
youre not Perhaps he didnt get the letter You sent it to his office
and he may have been called out of town But his mother

Mrs Dunn was not well when I last saw her She may be ill

Perhaps But if youre so sure about them why not let it go at that
Whats the use of fretting

I was not thinking of themthen

As a matter of fact she had been thinking of her uncle Elisha Warren
As the time dragged by she thought of him more and morenot as the
uncouth countryman whose unwelcome presence had been forced into her
life nor as the hypocrite whose insult to her fathers memory she
never could forgive or whose doubledealing had been as she thought
revealed but as the man who with the choke in his voice and the tears
in his eyes bade her remember that whenever she needed help he was
ready and glad to give it

She did not doubt Malcolms loyalty Her brothers hints and
insinuations found no echo in her thoughts In the note which she had
written her fiance she told of the loss of their fortune though not of
her fathers shame That she could not tell nor did she ask Malcolm to
come to herher pride would not permit that She wrote simply of her
great trouble and trusted the rest to him That he had not come was
dueso she kept repeating to herselfsolely to the fact that he had
not received her letter She knew that was itshe knew it And yetand
yet he did not come

So in her loneliness and misery her guardians words returned again
and again to her memory Sometimes when things look all right they turn
out to be all wrong If ever there comes a time like that to you and
Steve remember youve got me to turn to The time had come when she
must turn to someone

She would never go to him she vowed it She would not accept his help
if he came to her But if he was sincere if he meant what he said
why did he not come again to proffer it Because he was not sincere
of course That had been proven long before She despised him But
his face as she last saw it refused to be banished from her mind
It looked so strong and yet gentle and loving like the face of a
protector one to be trusted through good times and bad Oh this
wicked wicked world and the shams and sorrows in it Malcolm why
dont you come to me

Stephen uttered an exclamation Looking up she saw him hurrying toward
the hall

Someones at the door he explained Its Sylvester of course Ill
let him in

It was not the lawyer but a messenger boy with a note Stephen returned
to the library with the missive in his hand

He couldnt get here Caro he said excitedly Wants us to come
right down to his office Hurry up Get your things on The cabs
waiting Come Rush It may be important

The cab an electric vehicle made good time and they soon reached the
Pine Street offices where they were ushered at once into the senior
partners presence

Step into the other room said Mr Sylvester and wait there please
Ill join you shortly

The room was the large one where the momentous conference between
Captain Elisha and the three lawyers had so recently taken place
Caroline seated herself in one of the chairs Stephen walked the floor

Hope he doesnt keep us waiting long he fumed I thought of course
he was ready or he wouldnt have sent for us

Ready his sister looked at him questioningly Ready for what she
repeated with sudden suspicion Steve do you know what Mr Sylvester
wishes to see us about

Her brother colored and seemed a bit disconcerted How should I know
he muttered

Is it something new about the estate or that man who owns it You do
know something I can see it in your face What is it

Nothing How should I know what it is

But you do I believe you do Look at me What does Mr Sylvester want
of us

The boy hesitated then whirled and faced her See here Caro he
said maybe I do know somethingor I can guess Now whatever happens
youve got to be a sensible girl Certain things have to be dealt
with in a practical way and were practical people Sentimentand
prideand all that sort of stuff are well enough but business is
business and an engagement is an engagement Now its right up to you
and

Steve what are you talking about

Thats all right I know what Im talking about Somebody in the
family must use common sense and when it comes to holding a person to a
promise thenConfound it Sis we cant starve can we

What do you mean She rose and advanced toward him What do you mean
by a promise What have you been doing

His confusion increased He avoided her eyes and moved sullenly toward
the other side of the table

I havent done anything he grumbled that is Ive done what any
reasonable fellow would do Im not the only one who thinks Look
here Weve got a guardian havent we

A guardian a _guardian_ Stephen Warren have you been to him Have
youWas _that_ where you were last night

Well I

Answer me

What if I have Whom else am I to go to Isnt he

But why did you go to him What did you say

I saidI saidNever mind what I said He agrees with me I can tell
you that Youll thank your stars I did go before very long I
Ssh Heres Sylvester

The door of the room opened The person who entered however was not
the lawyer but the very man of whom they had been speaking Captain
Elisha himself He closed the door behind him

Hello Stevie he said with a nod to the boy Then turning to his
niece he stepped forward and held out his hand Caroline he began
I dont doubt youre some surprised to see me here but I Why
whats the matter

The faces of the pair led him to ask the question Stephens was red and
he looked embarrassed and guilty Carolines was white and she glanced
from her brother to her guardian and back again with flashing eyes

Whats the matter repeated the captain Steve sharply have you
been making a fool of yourself again What is it

Nothing was the sulky answer nothing of consequence Caro iswell
I happened to mention that I called on you last night andand she
doesnt seem to like it thats all As I told her somebody in the
family had to use common sense and you were our guardian and naturally
under the circumstances Why Ill leave it to anyone with a burst
of righteous indignation You _are_ our guardian

He proclaimed it as if he expected a denial Captain Elisha frowned
Humph he grunted That aint exactly news is it Steve Seems to me
weve taken up that pint afore though as I remember you didnt used
to be sot on all hands knowin it with dry sarcasm I dont need even
your common sense to remind me of it just at this minute Caroline your
brother did come to see me last night I was glad he did

She ignored him Steve she demanded still facing the young man was
this too a part of your plan Did you bring me here to meethim

No I didnt Sylvester was to come to see us You know that he
telephoned I didnt know

The captain interrupted There there son he exclaimed let me say
a word No Caroline Stevie didnt know I was to meet you here But
I thought it was necessary that I should Set down please I know you
must be worn out poor girl

I dont wish to sit I want to know what my brother called to see you
about

Well there was some matters he wanted to talk over

What were they Concerning the estate

Partly that

Partly What else Captain Warren my brother has hintedhe has
saidWhat does he mean by holding someone to a promise Answer me
truthfully

I shouldnt answer you any other way Caroline Steve seems to be
worried aboutnow you mustnt mind my speakin plain Caroline the
times come when Ive got toSteve seems to be worried about the young
man youre engaged to He seems to callate that Mr Dunn may want to
slip out of that engagement

His niece looked at him Then she turned to her brother You went to
_him_ and Oh how _could_ you

Stephen would not meet her gaze Well he muttered rebelliously why
wouldnt I You know yourself that Mal hasnt been near you since it
happened If he wasnt afterif he was straight he would have come
wouldnt he Mind I dont say he isntperhaps he doesnt know But
at any rate something must be done We had to face possibilities and
you wouldnt listen to me I tried

Stop she cut him short imperiously Dont make me hate you And
you turning to her uncle did _you_ listen and believe such things
Did you encourage him to believe them Oh I know what you think of my
friends I heard it from your own lips And I know why you think it
Because they know what you are because they exposed you and

There there Caroline you neednt go on Ive heard your opinion
of my character afore Never mind me for the minute And if youll
remember _I_ aint said that I doubted your young man You told me
that you thought the world and all of him and that he did of you Thats
enoughor ought to be But your brother says you wrote him two days ago
and he aint been near you

I misdirected the letter He didnt receive it

Umhm I see That would explain

Of course it would That _must_ be the reason

Yes seems if it must

It is What right have you to doubt it Oh how can you think such
things Can you suppose the man I am to marry is so despicableso
_mean_ as toas toIm ashamed to say it Why do you presume that
money has any part in our engagement Such trouble as mine only makes it
more binding Do you suppose if _he_ were poor asas I am that I would
desert _him_ You know I wouldnt I should be gladyes almost happy
because then I could show himcould

Her voice failed her She put her handkerchief to her eyes for an
instant and then snatched it away and faced them her head erect The
pride in her face was reflected in Captain Elishas as he regarded her

No no he said gently I never supposed youd act but in one way
Caroline I knew _you_ And as Stevell tell you I said to him almost
the same words youve been sayin If Malcolms what hed ought to be
I said hell be glad of the chance to prove how much he cares for your
sister But Steve appeared to have some misgivins and so

He paused turned toward the door and seemed to be listening Caroline
flashed an indignant glance at her brother

And so she asked scornfully

And so continued the captain with a slight change in his tone it
seemed to me that his doubts ought to be settled And rising as there
came a tap at the door I callate theyre goin to be

He walked briskly over and opened the door Sylvester was standing
without

Come have they inquired Captain Elisha

Yes

Fetch em right in here Steve stand over nigher that corner This
way Caroline if you please

He took his niece by the arm and led her to the side of the room not
visible from the doorway She was too astonished to resist but asked an
agitated question

What is it she cried Who is coming

Some friends of yours was the quiet reply Nothin to be frightened
about Steve stay where you are

The boy was greatly excited Is it they he demanded Is it By gad
Now Sis be a sensible girl If he should try to hedge you hold him
Hold him Understand

Steve be quiet ordered the captain Ah Mrs Dunn good
afternoon maam Mr Dunn good afternoon sir

For the pair who followed by Sylvester now entered the room were Mrs
Corcoran Dunn and Malcolm

They were past the sill before Captain Elishas greeting caused them to
turn and see the three already there Mrs Dunn who was in the lead
stopped short in her majestic though creaking march of entrance and her
florid face turned a brighter crimson Her son strolling languidly at
her heels started violently and dropped his hat The lawyer bringing
up in the rear closed the door and remained standing near it Caroline
uttered an exclamation of surprise Her brother drew himself haughtily
erect Captain Elisha remained unperturbed and smiling

Good afternoon maam he repeated Its been some time since you and
I run across each other I hope youre feelin pretty smart

Mrs Dunn had faced some unpleasant situations in her life and
had proved equal to them Usually however she had been prepared
beforehand For this she had not been preparedas yet She had come
to the offices of Sylvester Kuhn and Graves at the senior partners
request to be told as she supposed the full and final details of
the financial disaster threatening the Warren family If those details
should prove the disaster as overwhelming as it appeared thenwell
then certain disagreeable duties must be performed But to meet the
girl to whom her son was engaged and whom she and he had carefully
avoided meeting until the lawyers should acquaint them with the whole
truthto meet this girl and her brother and her guardian thus
unexpectedly and unprepared was enough to shake the composure and nerve
of even such a veteran campaigner as Mrs M Corcoran Dunn

But of the three to whom the meeting was an absolute
surpriseCaroline Malcolm and herselfshe was characteristically the
first to regain outward serenity For a moment she stood nonplused and
speechless but only for a moment Then she hastened with outstretched
arms to Caroline and clasped her in affectionate embrace

My dear child she cried my dear girl Im _so_ glad to see you
Ive thought of you so much And I pity you so Poor Malcolm
hasMalcolm sharply come here Dont you see Caroline

Malcolm was groping nervously for his hat He picked it up and obeyed
his mothers summons though with no great eagerness

How dye do Caroline he stammered confusedly IIIts a deuce
of a surprise to see you down here The mater and I didnt expectthat
is we scarcely hoped to meet anyone but Sylvester He sent for us you
know

He extended his hand She did not take it

Did you get my letter she asked quickly Mrs Dunn answered for him

Yes dear he got it she said The poor fellow was almost crazy I
began to fear for his sanity I did indeed I did not dare trust him
out of my sight Oh if you could but know how we feel for you and pity
you

Pity was not what Caroline wanted just then The word jarred upon her
She avoided the ladys embrace and once more faced the embarrassed
Malcolm

You got my letter she cried You _did_

Yeseryes I got it Caroline Iby Jove you know

He hesitated stammered and looked thoroughly uncomfortable His mother
regarded him wrathfully

Well she snapped why dont you go on Caroline dear you really
must excuse him The dear boy is quite overcome

Captain Elisha stepped forward

Excuse me for interruptin maam he said addressing the ruffled
matron but I know youre sort of surprised to see us all here and
maybe Id better explain Mr Sylvester told me you and your son had an
appointment with him for this afternoon Now there was something weor
I anyhowwanted to talk with you about so I thought we might as well
make one job of it Sylvesters a pretty busy man and I know he has
other things to attend to so why not let him go ahead and tell you what
you come to hear and then we can take up the other part by ourselves
Hes told me what you wanted to see him about and its somethin were
all interested in bein as were one familyor goin to be pretty
soon So suppose he just tells you now Aint that a good idea

Mrs Dunn looked at the speaker and then at the lawyer and seemed to
have caught some of her sons embarrassment

Iwe did have an appointment with Mr Sylvester she admitted
reluctantly but the business was not important And haughtily I do
not care to discuss it here

The captain opened his eyes Hey he exclaimed Not important You
surprise me maam I judged twas mighty important Twas about the
real size of your fathers estate Caroline turning to the girl I
thought Mrs Dunn and Mr Malcolm must think twas important for I
understand theyve been telephonin and askin for appointments for the
last two days Why yes and they come way down here in all this storm
on purpose to talk it over with him Am I wrong Aint that so maam

It was so and Mrs Dunn could not well deny it Therefore she took
refuge in a contemptuous silence The captain nodded

As to discussin it here he went on with bland innocence why were
all family folks same as I said and there aint any secrets between us
on _that_ subject So suppose we all listen while Mr Sylvester tells
just what hed have told you and Mr Malcolm Its pretty hard to hear
but bad news is soon told Heave ahead Mr Sylvester

Mrs Dunn made one more attempt to avoid the crisis she saw was
approaching

Surely Caroline she said testily you dont wish your private
affairs treated in this public manner Come let us go

She laid a hand on the girls arm Captain Elisha quietly interposed

No no he said Well all stay here Theres nothin public about
it

Caroline crimson with mortification protested indignantly

Mr Sylvester she said it is not necessary to

Excuse me her uncles tone was sharper and more stern I think it
is Go on Sylvester

The lawyer looked far from comfortable but he spoke at once and to the
point

I should have told you and your son just this Mrs Dunn he said
I intimated it before and Miss Warren had already written you the
essential facts A new and unexpected development the nature of which I
am not at liberty to disclose now or later makes Abijah Warrens estate
absolutely bankrupt Not only that but many thousand dollars in debt
His heirs are left penniless That is the plain truth Im very sorry
to say There is no hope of anything better Youll forgive me Miss
Warren I hope for putting it so bluntly but I thought it best to
avoid every possible misunderstanding

It was blunt beyond doubt Even Captain Elisha winced at the word
penniless Stephen muttered under his breath and turned his back
Caroline swaying put a hand on the table to steady herself The Dunns
looked at each other

Thank you Mr Sylvester said the captain quietly Ill see you
again in a few moments

The lawyer bowed and left the room evidently glad to escape Captain
Elisha turned to Mrs Dunn

And now maam he observed that part of the business is over The
next parts even more in the family so I thought we didnt need legal
advice You see just how matters stand My niece is a poor girl She
needs somebody to support her and look out for her Shes got that
somebody were all thankful to say Shes engaged to Mr Malcolm here
And as youre his ma Mrs Dunn and Im Carolines guardian us old
folksll take our affairs in hand they neednt listen if they dont
want to I understand from Steve that Malcolms been mighty anxious to
have the weddin day hurried along I cant say as I blame him And _I_
think the sooner theyre married the better Now how soon can we make
it Mrs Dunn

This unexpected and matteroffact query was variously received Mrs
Dunn frowned and flushed Malcolm frowned also Steve nodded emphatic
approval As for Caroline she gazed at her guardian in horrified
amazement

Why she cried YouyouWhat do you mean by such

Dont be an idiot Caro cut in her brother I told you to be
sensible Captain Warrens dead right

Stevie you stay out of this There was no misunderstanding the
captains tone When I want your opinion Ill ask for it And
Caroline I want you to stay out too This is my trick at the wheel
Mrs Dunn what dyou say Never mind the young folks You and me know
that marriage is business same as everything else How soon can we have
the weddin

Mrs Dunn had apparently nothing to sayto him She addressed her
next remark to Caroline

My dear she said in great agitation this is really too dreadful
Thiserguardian of yours appears to think he is in some barbarous
countryordering the savages about Come Malcolm take her away

No Captain Elisha stepped in front of the door She aint goin and
Id rather you wouldnt go yet Lets settle this up now I aint askin
anything unreasonable Carolines under my charge and Ive got to plan
for her Your boys just crazy to marry her hes been beggin for her
to name the day Lets name it It neednt be tomorrow I callate
youll want to get out invitations and such It neednt be next week
But just say about when it can be then Ill know how to plan That
aint much to ask sartin

Much or little neither Mrs Dunn nor her son appeared ready to answer
Malcolm fidgeted with his hat and gloves his mother fanned herself with
her handkerchief Caroline frantic with humiliation and shame would
have protested again but her guardians stern shake of the head
silenced her

Well Mr Dunn turning to the groomtobe youre one of the
interested partieswhat do you say

Malcolm ground his heel into the rug I dont consider it your
business he declared Youre butting in where

No no I aint Its my business and business is just _what_ it is
Your ma knows that She and I had a real confidential up and down talk
on love and marriage and shes the one that proved to me that marryin
in high society like yours and the kind Carolines been circulatin in
was business and mighty little else Theres a business contract between
you and my niece We want to know how soon it can be carried out thats
all

The young man looked desperately at the door but the captains broad
shoulders blocked the way towards it He hesitated scowled and then
with a shrug of his shoulders surrendered

How can I marry he demanded sullenly Confound it my salary isnt
large enough to pay my own way decently

Malcolm cried his mother warningly

Well Mater what the devils the use of all this You know By
Jove you _ought_ to

Hold on young feller I dont understand Your wages aint large
enough you say What do you mean You was _goin_ to be married wasnt
you

Mrs Dunn plunged to the rescue a forlorn hope but desperate and
fighting to the end

An outrage she blurted Malcolm I forbid you to continue this
disgusting conversation Caroline my poor child I dont blame you for
this but I call on you to stop it at once My dear I

She advanced toward the girl with outstretched arms Caroline recoiled

Dont dont she gasped Captain Elisha spoke up sharp and stern

Excuse me maam he said but Ill be obliged if youll wait a
minute Caroline dont you say a word You sayyou addressing
Malcolm that you cant support a wife on your wages You surprise me
some considerin the swath youve been cuttin on embut never mind
that Maybe they wont keep automobiles anderother things Ive heard
you was interested in but if you cut them out and economize a little
same as young married folks Ive known have been glad to do you could
scrape along couldnt you Hey Couldnt you

Malcolms answer was another scornful shrug You belong on Cape Cod
he sneered Mater lets get out of this

Wait Put it plain now Do I understand that you callate to break the
engagement because my niece has lost her money Is that it

Mrs Dunn realized that the inevitable was upon them After all it
might as well be faced now as later

This is ridiculous she proclaimed Every sane person knowsthough
_barbarians_ may not with a venomous glare at the captainthat
in engagements of the kind in which my son shared a certain amount
oferfinancialerthat is the bride is supposed to have some
money It is expected Of course it is Love in a cottage iswella
bit _passe_ My son and I pity your niece from the bottom of our hearts
butthere under the circumstances the whole affair becomes impossible
Caroline my dear Im dreadfully sorry dreadfully I love you like my
own child And poor Malcolm will be heartbrokenbutyou _see_

She extended her hand in a gesture of utter helplessness Stephen
who had been fuming and repressing his rage with difficulty during the
scene leaped forward with brandished fist

By gad he shouted Mal Dunn you cad

His uncle pushed him back with a sweep of his arm

Steve he ordered Im runnin this ship He gave a quick glance at
his niece and then added speaking rapidly and addressing the head of
the Dunn family I see maam Yes yes I see Well youve forgot one
thing I guess Carolines lived in high society too And Ive been in
it a spell myself And Steves a boy but hes got a business head If
theres nothin in marriage but business then an engagement is what I
just called it a business contract and it cant be broke without the
consent of both sides You wanted Carolines money maybe she wants
yours now If she does and theres such a thing as law why perhaps
she can get it

Thats the talk cried Stephen exultingly

Yup perhaps she can She may be a business woman too you know If
money and style and social positions what counts and she wants to force
you to keep your promise why Im her guardian and she can count on me
to back her up What do you say Caroline Im at your service I

But Caroline interrupted him

Stop she cried wildly Oh stop Do you thinkdo you suppose I
would marry him now _Now_ after Ive seen what he is Oh with a
shudder of disgust when I think what I might have done I Thank
God that the money has gone Im glad Im poor Im _glad_

Caro you fool shrieked Stephen She did not heed him

Let me go she cried Let me get away from him from this room I
never want to see him or think of him again Please _Please_ let me go
Oh take me home Captain Warren _please_ let me go home

Her uncle was at her side in a moment Yes yes dearie he said
Ill take you home Dont give way now Ill

He would have taken her arm but she shrank from him

Not you she begged Steve

The captains face clouded but he answered promptly

Of courseSteve he agreed Steve take your sister home Mr
Sylvesters got a carriage waitin and hell go with you I dont
doubt Do as I tell you boyand behave yourself Dont wait go

He held the door open until the hysterical girl and her brother had
departed Then he turned to the Dunns

Well maam he said dryly I dont knows theres anything more to
be said All the questions seem to be settled Our acquaintance want
so awful long but it was interestin Knowin you has been as the
feller said a liberal education Dont let me keep you any longer Good
afternoon

He stepped away from the door Malcolm and his mother remained standing
for an instant where they were when Caroline left

The young man looked as if he would enjoy choking someone the captain
preferably but said nothing Then Mrs Dunn bethought herself of a way
to make their exit less awkward and embarrassing

My heart she said gasping and with a clutch at her breast My
poor heart II fear Im going to have one of my attacks Malcolm your
armquick

With an expression of intense but patient suffering and leaning heavily
upon her sons arm she moved past Captain Elisha and from the room

     

That evening the captain stood in the lower hall of the apartment house
at Central Park West undecided what to do next He wished more than
anything else in the world to go to his niece He would have gone to her
beforehad been dying to go to soothe to comfort to tell her of his
lovebut he was afraid His conscience troubled him Perhaps he had
been too brutal Perhaps he shouldnt have acted as he did Maybe
forcing the Dunn fleet to show its colors could have been done more
diplomatically He had wanted her to see those colors for herself to
actually see them But he might have overdone it He remembered how she
shrank from him and turned to her brother She might hate him more than
ever now If so then the whole scheme under which he was working fell
to pieces

He was worried about Steve too That young man would naturally
be furious with his sister for what he would consider her romantic
foolishness He had been warned to behave himself but would he Captain
Elisha paced up and down the marble floor before the elevator cage and
wondered whether his visiting the apartment would be a wise move or a
foolish one

The elevator descended the door of the cage opened and Stephen himself
darted out His face was red he was scowling fiercely and he strode
toward the street without looking in his guardians direction

The captain caught him as he passed

Here boy he exclaimed wheres the fire Where are you bound

His nephew brought thus unexpectedly to a halt stared at him

Oh its you he exclaimed Humph Im boundI dont know where Im
bound

You dont hey Well you can cruise a long ways on a vyage like that
What do you mean

Aw let me alone Im going to the club I guess or somewhere Anyhow
I wont stay with her I told her so Silly little idiot By gad she
understands what I think of her conduct Ill never speak to her again
I told her so She

Here Belay Stop Who are you talking about

Caro of course She

Youve run off and left her alonetonight Where is she

Upstairsand crying I suppose She doesnt do anything else Its all
shes good for Selfish romantic

He got no further for Captain Elisha sent him reeling with a push and
ran to the elevator

Eighth floor he commanded

The door of the apartment was not latched Stephen in his rage and
hurry had neglected such trifles The captain opened it quietly and
walked in He entered the library Caroline was lying on the couch
her head buried in the pillows She did not hear him cross the room He
leaned over and touched her shoulder She started looked and sat up
gazing at him as though not certain whether he was a dream or reality

And he looked at her at her pretty face now so white and careworn at
her eyes at the tearstains on her cheeks and his whole heart went out
to her

Caroline dearie he faltered forgive me for comin here wont you
I had to come I couldnt leave you alone I couldnt rest thinkin of
you alone in your trouble I know you must feel harder than ever towards
me for this afternoons doins but I meant it for the best I _had_ to
show youdont you see Can you forgive me Wont you try to forgive
the old feller that loves you moren all the world Wont you try

She looked at him wideeyed clasping and unclasping her hands

_I_ forgive _you_ she repeated incredulously

Yes Try to dearie Oh if you would only believe I meant it for your
good and nothin else If you could only just trust me and come to me
and let me help you I want you my girl I want you

She leaned forward Do you really mean it she cried How can you
after all Ive done after the way Ive treated you and the things Ive
said You must _hate_ me Everyone does I hate myself You cant
forgive me You cant

His answer was to hold out his arms Another moment and she was in them
clinging to his wet coat sobbing holding him fast and begging him not
to leave her to take her away that she would work that she would not
be a burden to himonly take her with him and try to forgive her for
he was real and honest and the only friend she had

And Captain Elisha soothing her stroking her hair and murmuring words
of love and tenderness realized that his labor and sacrifice had
not been in vain that here was his recompense she would never
misunderstand him again she was his at last

And yet in the midst of his joy his conscience troubled him more than
ever




CHAPTER XX


It was April and May was close at hand The weather was all that late
April weather should be and so often is not Trees bushes and vines
were in bud the green of the new grass was showing everywhere above the
dead brown of the old a pair of bluebirds were inspecting the hollow of
the old apple tree with an eye toward spring housekeeping the sun was
warm and bright and the water of the Sound sparkled in the distance
Caroline sitting by the livingroom window was waiting for her uncle
to return from the city

In the kitchen Annie Moriarty was preparing dinner Annie was now cook
as well as chambermaid for of all the Warren servants she was the
only one remaining Edwards the Commodore had been dismissed had
departed not without reluctance but philosophically to seek other
employment Yes miss observed Edwards when notified that his
services were no longer required I understand Ive been expecting
it I was in a family before that met with financial difficulties and
I know the signs All I can say is that I hope you and Mr Stephen will
get on all right miss If theres anything I can do to help you by way
of friendship please let me know Id be glad for old times sake And
the cook wanted me to tell you that being as shes got another job in
sight and was paid up to date she wouldnt wait for notice but was
leaving immediate Shes gone already miss

The second maid went also But Annie Irish and grateful refused to go
Her mother came to back her in the refusal

Indeed shell not leave you Miss Carolineyou nor Captain Warren
neither Lord love him Sure dye think well ever forget what you and
him done for me and my Pat and the childer Youve got to have somebody
aint you And Annies cookin aint so bad that itll kill yez and
Ill learn her more Never mind what the wages is theyre big enough
Shell stay If she didnt Id break her back

So when the apartment was given up and Captain Elisha and his wards
moved to the little house in Westchester County Annie came with them
And her cooking though not by any means equal to that at Delmonicos
had not killed them yet Mrs Moriarty came once a week to do the
laundry work Caroline acted as a sort of inexperienced but willing
supervising housekeeper

The house itself had been procured through the kind interest of
Sylvester Keeping the apartment was under the circumstances out of
the question and Caroline hated it and was only too anxious to give it
up She had no suggestions to make She would go anywhere anywhere
that her guardian deemed best but might they not please go at once She
expected that he would suggest South Denboro and she would have gone
there without a complaint To get away from the place where she had been
so miserable was her sole wish And trusting and believing in her uncle
as she now did realizing that he had been right always and had worked
for her interest throughout and having been shown the falseness and
insincerity of the others whom she had once trusted implicitly she
clung to him with an appeal almost piteous Her pride was for the
time broken She was humble and grateful She surrendered to him
unconditionally and hoped only for his forgiveness and love

The captain did not suggest South Denboro He did however tell
Sylvester that he believed a little place out of the city would be the
better refuge for the present

Poor Carolines switched clear around he said to the lawyer and you
cant blame her much She callates New Yorks nothin but a sham from
stern to stern manned by liars and swindlers and hypocrites and
officered by thieves Taint no use to tell her taint though she
might pretend to believe it if _I_ told her for just now the poor girl
thinks Im Solomon and Saint Peter rolled into one The way she agrees
to whatever I say and the way she looks at me and sort of holds on to
me as if I was her only anchor in a gale I declare it makes me feel
meaner than poorhouse teaand thats made of blackberry leaves steeped
in memories of better things so Ive heard say _Am_ I a low down
scamp playin a dirty mean trick on a couple of orphans What do you
think Sylvester

You know what I think Captain Warren replied the lawyer Youre
handling the whole matter better than any other man could handle it No
one else would have thought of it to begin with and the results so far
prove that youre right

Yup Maybe I wish you was around to say that to me when I wake up
nights and get to thinkin However as I said Caroline believes New
York is like a sailors dance hall a place for decent folks to steer
clear of And when the feller youve been engaged to is shown up as a
sneak and your own dad as a crookwell you cant blame a green hand
for holdin prejudice against the town that raised em Shell get over
it but just now I callate some little flat or better still a
little home out where the back yards aint made of concrete would be
a firstclass port for us to make for Dont know of such a place at a
reasonable rent do you

I might find one And you may be right your niece might like it
better though it will be somewhat of a change But how about your
nephew He has no objection to the metropolis I should judge What will
he say

Nothin I guessunless he says it to himself Steves goin back to
New Haven with things on his mind He and I had a mornin service and
I was the parson He listened because when you aint got a cent except
what the society allows you it aint good orthodoxy to dodge the
charity sermon Stevell behave and what he dont like hell lump If
he starts to open his mouth his earll ache I callate I talked turkey
to that young man Yees with a slight smile Im sort of afraid I
lost patience with Stevie

When Caroline first saw the little house with its shingled sides the
dead vines over the porch and the dry stalks of last years flowers in
the yard her heart sank With the wind blowing and the bare branches
of the old apple tree scraping the roof and whining dolefully it looked
bleak and forsaken It was so different so unhomelike and so to her
eyes small and povertystricken She made believe that she liked it
exclaimed over the viewwhich on the particular day was desolate
enoughand declared the Dutch front door was oldfashioned and dear
But Captain Elisha watching her closely knew that she was only waiting
to be alone to give way to wretchedness and tears He understood
had expected that she would feel thus but he was disappointed
nevertheless However after the front door was passed and they were
inside the house Caroline looked about her in delighted amazement The
living room was small but bright and warm and cheery On its walls
hiding the rather vivid paper were hung some of the best of Rodgers
Warrens picturesthe Corot the codfisher and others The furniture
and rugs were those which had been in the library of the apartment
those she had been familiar with all her life The books many of them
were there also And the dining room except for size looked like
home So did the bedrooms and in the kitchen Annie grinned a welcome

But how could you asked Caroline How could you keep all these
things Uncle Elisha I thought of course they must all be sold I
cried when they took them away that day when we were leaving to go to
the hotel I was sure I should never see them again And here they all
are How could you do it

The captains grin was as wide as Annies Oh he explained I
couldnt let em all go Never intended to That five thousand dollar
codder up there seemed like own folks pretty nigh Id have kept
_him_ if we had to live in one room and a trunk And we aint got to
thatyet I tell you dearie I thought theyd make you feel more to
home And they do dont they

The look she gave him was answer sufficient

But the creditors she asked That man whothey belong to him dont
they I supposed of course they must go with the rest

Captain Elisha winked Theres times he answered when I believe in
cheatin my creditors This is one of em Never you mind that feller
you mentioned Hes got enough confound him He didnt have the face to
ask for any more Sylvester looked out for that Five hundred thousand
droppin in as you might say unexpected ought to soften anybodys
heart and I judge even that fellers got some bowels of mercy

He changed the subject hastily but Caroline asked no more questions
She never alluded to the lost estate never expressed any regrets
nor asked to know who it was that had seized her all The captain had
expected her to ask had been ready with the same answer he had given
Stephen but when he hinted she herself had forbade his continuing
Dont tell me about it she begged I dont want to know any more
Father did wrong butbut I know he did not mean to He was a good
kind father to me and I loved him This man whose money he took had a
right to it and now it is his He doesnt wish us to know who he is so
Steve says and Im glad I dont want to know because if I did I
might hate him And with a shudder I am trying so hard not to hate
anybody

Her makebelieve liking for the little home became more and more real
as spring drew near She began to take an interest in it in the flower
garden in the beds beside the porch where the peonies and daffodils
were beginning to show green heads above the loam and in the household
affairs And she had plans of her own not connected with these She
broached them to her uncle and they surprised and delighted him
although he would not give his consent to them entirely

You mustnt think she said that because I have been willing to
live on your money since mine went that I mean to continue doing it I
dont Ive been thinking a great deal and I realize that I must earn
my own way just as soon as I can Im not fitted for anything now but
I can be and I shall Ive thought perhaps I might learn stenography
oror something like that Girls do

He looked at her serious face and choked back his laugh

Why yes he admitted they do thats a fact About four hundred
thousand of em do and four hundred thousand more try to and then try
to make business men think that they have I heard Sylvester sputterin
about a couple in his office tother day said they was no good and not
worth the seven dollars a week he paid em

Seven dollars a _week_ she repeated

Yes Course some make three times that and more but theyre the
experienced ones the good ones And theres heaps that dont What
makes you so sot on earnin a livin Caroline Aint you satisfied with
the kind Im tryin to give you

She regarded him reproachfully Please dont say that she protested
You always treat your kindness as a joke but to me itit

There there quickly Dont lets talk foolish I see what you
mean dearie It aint the livin but because Im givin it to you that
troubles you I know Well _I_ aint complainin but I understand your
feelins and respect em However I shouldnt study typewritin if
I was you Theres too much competition in it to be comfortable as the
fat man said about runnin races Ive got a suggestion if you want to
listen to it

I do indeed What is it

Why just this Ive been about everythin aboard ship but Ive never
been a steward Now Ill say this much for Annie she tried hard She
tumbled into general housekeepin the way Asa Foster said he fell into
the cucumber framewith a jolt and a jingle and shes doin her best
accordin to her lights But sometimes her lights need ile or trimmin
or somethin Ive had the feelin that we need a good housekeeper
here If Annies intelligence was as broad and liberal as her shoes we
wouldnt as tis we do Ill hire you Caroline for that job if you
say so

I Uncle Elisha youre joking

No I aint Course I realize you aint had much experience in runnin
a house and I hope you understand I dont want to hire you as a cook
But Ive had a scheme in the back of my head for a fortnit or more
Somethin Sylvester said about a young lady cousin of his made me
think of it Seems over here at the female collegeyou know where I
meantheyre teachin a new course that theyve christened Domestic
Science Nighs I can find out it is about what our great granmarms
larned at home that with uptodate trimmins All about runnin a
house it is how to superintend servants and what kind of things
to have to eat and how they ought to be cooked and takin care of
childrenHumph we dont need that do weand well everything
that a home woman rich or poor ought to know At least she ought to
cordin to my oldfashioned notions Sylvesters cousin goes there and
likes it and I judge she aint figgerin to be anybodys hired help
either My idea was about this If youd like to take this course
Caroline you could do it afternoons Mornins and the days you had off
you could apply your science here at home on Annie Truly it would
save me hirin somebody else andwell maybe youd enjoy it you cant
tell

His niece seemed interested

I know of the Domestic Science course she said Several of my
friendsmy former friends were studying it But Im afraid Uncle
that I dont see where earning my living has any part in it It seems to
me that it means your spending more money for me paying my tuition

No moren Id spend for a competent housekeeper Honest Caroline Id
like to do it You think it over a spell

She did visiting the University and making inquiries What she was told
there decided her She took up the course and enjoyed it It occupied
her mind and prevented her brooding over the past She might have made
many friends among the other students but she was careful to treat
them only as acquaintances Her recent experience with friends was too
fresh in her mind She studied hard and applied her knowledge at home
She and Annie made some odd and funny mistakes at first but they were
not made twice and Captain Elisha noticed a great improvement in the
housekeeping Also Carolines spirits improved though more slowly

Most evenings they spent together in the living room She read aloud to
her uncle who smoked his cigar and listened commenting on the doings
of the story folk with characteristic originality and aptitude Each
night after the reading was over he wrote his customary note to Abbie
Baker at South Denboro He made one flying trip to that village Just
to prove to em that Im still alive as he explained it Some of
those folks down there at the postoffice must have pretty nigh forgot
to gossip about me by this time Theyve had me eloped and married and
a millionaire and a pauper long ago I dont doubt And now theyve
probably forgot me altogether Ill just run down and stir em up Good
subjects for yarns are scurce at that postoffice and they ought to be
thankful

On his return he told his niece that he found everything much as usual
Thoph Kenneys raised a beard cause shavins so expensive and the
ComeOuter minister called the place the other denominations are bound
for Hades and his congregation are thinkin of firin him for turnin
FreeThinker Thats about all the sensations he said I couldnt
get around town much on account of Abbie She kept me in bed most of the
time while she sewed on buttons and mended Said she never saw a bodys
clothes in such a state in _her_ life

A few of the neighbors called occasionally And there were other
callers Captain Elishas unexpected departure from Mrs Heptons
boarding house had caused a sensation and much regret to that select
establishment The landlady aided and abetted by Mrs Van Winkle
Ruggles would have given a farewell tea in his honor but he declined
Dont you do it he said I like my tea pretty strong and farewells
are watery sort of things the best of em And this aint a real
farewell anyhow

Say _au revoir_ but not goodby sang Miss Sherborne sentimentally

Thats it Everybody knows what goodby means Well say the other
thingas well as we canand change it to Hello the very first time
any of you come out to see us

They were curious to know his reason for leaving He explained that his
niece was sort of lonesome and needed country air he was going to live
with her for the present Consequently Mrs Ruggles on the trail of
aristocracy was the first to call Hers was a stately and ceremonious
visit They were glad when it was over Lawton the bookseller and his
wife came and were persuaded to remain and dine Caroline liked them at
sight The most impressive call however was that of Mr and Mrs C
Dickens The great man made it a point to dress in the style of bygone
years and his conversation was a treat His literary labors were
fatiguing and confining he admitted and the little breath of rural
ozone which this trip to Westchester County gave him was like a
tonicyes as one might say a tonic prescribed and administered by
Dame Nature herself

I formerly resided in the country he told Caroline

Yes put in his wife we used to live at Bayonne New Jersey We
had such a pretty house there that is half a house you see it was a
double one and

Maria her husband waved his hand why trouble our friends with
unnecessary details

But it _was_ a pretty house C dear with a pathetic little sigh
Ive missed it a great deal since Miss Warren C had a joke about
ithes such a joker He used to call it Gads Hill Junior

Named after some of David Bs folks asked Captain Elisha innocently
The answer delivered by Mr Dickens was condescending and explanatory

Caroline laughed actually laughed aloud when the visit was over Her
uncle was immensely pleased

Hooray he cried Ill invite em up to stay a week Thats the fust
time Ive heard you laugh for I dont know when

She laughed again I cant help it she said they are so funny

The captain chuckled Yes he said and they dont know it I
callate a persons skull has got room for just about so much in it and
no more Cornelius Charless head is so jammed with selfsatisfaction
that his sense of humor was crowded out of door long ago

One boarder at Mrs Heptons did not call nor did Captain Elisha allude
to him Caroline noticed the latter fact and understood the reason
Also when the captain went to the city as he frequently did and
remained longer than usual she noticed that his explanations of the
way in which he spent his time were sometimes vague and hurried She
understood and was troubled Yet she thought a great deal on the subject
before she mentioned it

On the April afternoon when Caroline sat at the window of the living
room awaiting her uncles return she was thinking of that subject
But at last her mind was made up It was a hard thing to do it was
humiliating in a way it mightthough she sincerely hoped notbe
misconstrued as to motive but it was right Captain Elisha had been
so unselfish so glad to give up every personal inclination in order to
please her that she would no longer permit her pride to stand in the
way of his gratification even in little things At least she would
speak to him on the matter

He came on a later than his usual train and at dinner when she asked
where he had been replied Oh to see Sylvester anderaround She
asked him no more but when they were together in the living room she
moved her chair over beside his and said without looking at him

Uncle Elisha I know where youve been this afternoon Youve been to
see Mr Pearson

Hey He started leaned back and regarded her with astonishment and
some alarm

Youve been to see Mr Pearson she repeated havent you

Whywhy yes Caroline I haveto tell you the truth I dont see how
you knew but nervously I hope you dont feel bad cause I did I
go to see him pretty often You see I think a good deal of hima whole
lot of him _I_ think hes a fine young feller Course I know you dont
and so I never mention him to you But I do hope you aint goin to ask
me not to see him

She shook her head No she said I would have no right to ask that
even if I wished to And I do not wish it Uncle Elisha if you were
alone here he would come to see you I know he would Invite him to
come please

His astonishment was greater than ever

Invite him to come _here_ he asked To see you

No hastily to see you This is your home I have no right to keep
your friends from visiting it I know you would sacrifice everything
for me even them but I will not be so selfish as to allow it Ask him
here please I really want you to

He pulled his beard Caroline he answered slowly Im much obliged
to you I understand why youre doin this and I thank you But it
aint likely that Ill say yes is it And do you suppose Jim would come
if I did ask him He knows you believe hes awell all thats bad You
told him so and you sent him away I will give in that Id like to have
him here Hes one of the few men friends Ive made since I landed
in New York But under the circumstancesyou feelin as you doI
couldnt ask him and he wouldnt come if I did

She remained silent for a time Then she said Uncle I want you to
tell me the truth about Mr Pearson and fatherjust why they
quarreled and the real truth of the whole affair Dont spare my
feelings tell me what you believe is the true story I know you think
Mr Pearson was right for you said so

The captain was much troubled

II dont knows Id better dearie he answered I think I do know
the truth but you might think I was hard on Bijeon your father I
aint And I sympathize with the way he felt too But Jim did right as
I see it He acted just as Id want a son of mine to do And Well I
callate wed better not rake up old times had we

I want you to tell me Please do

I dont knows Id better You have been told the story different
and

I know I have That is the reason why I ask you to tell it Oh with
a flash of scorn I was told many stories and I want to forget them
And sadly I can bear whatever you may tell me even about father
Since I learned that he was aa

Ssh Caroline dont

After that I can bear anything I think This cannot be worse

Worse No not This aint very bad I will tell you dearie This is
just what happened

He told her the exact truth concerning the Trolley Combine his
brothers part in it and Pearsons She listened without comment

I see she said when he had finished I think I see Mr Pearson felt
that as a newspaper man an honest one he must go on He knew that the
thing was wrong and that innocent people might lose money in it It was
his duty to expose it and he did it even though it meant the loss of
influence and of fathers friendship I see

That was about it Caroline I think the hardest part for him was when
Bije called him ungrateful Bije had been mighty kind to him thats a
fact

Yes Father was kind I know that better than anyone else But Mr
Pearson was right Yes he was right and brave

So I size it up And I do sympathize with your father too This want
such an awful lot worse than a good many stock deals And poor Bije was
perfectly desprate I guess If it had gone through hed have been able
to square accounts with the Rubber Company and just think what that
would have meant to him Poor feller poor feller He sighed She
reached for his hand and stroked it gently with her own

After another interval she said How I insulted and wronged him How he
must despise me

Who Jim No no he dont do any such thing He knows you didnt
understand and who was responsible Jims got sense lots of it

But it is my misunderstanding and my insulting treatment of him which
have kept you two aparthere at any rate

Dont let that worry you Caroline I see him every once in a while up
to the city

It does worry me and it will until it is made right And in a lower
tone but with decision it shall be

She rose and bending over kissed him on the forehead Good night
Uncle she said

Captain Elisha was disappointed What he exclaimed Goin aloft so
soon We aint had our readin yet Pretty early to turn in seems to
me Stay a little longer do

Not tonight dear Im going to my room Please excuse me this time
She turned to go and then turning back again asked a final question

Youre sure she said hesitatingly youre quite sure he will not
come hereto youif you tell him I understand andand you ask him

Well Caroline I dont know You see I was responsible for his comin
before He had some scruples against it then but I talked him down
Hes sort of proud Jim is and he mightmight not want toto

I see Good night Uncle

The next morning after breakfast she came to him again

Uncle Elisha she said I have written him

What Youve written Written who

Mr Pearson I wrote him telling him I had learned the true story of
his disagreement with father and that he was right and I was wrong I
apologized for my behavior toward him Now I think perhaps if you ask
him he will come

The captain looked at her He realized the sacrifice of her pride which
writing that letter must have meant and that she had done it for him
He was touched and almost sorry she had done it He took both her hands
in his

Dearie he said you shouldnt have done that I didnt expect you
to I know you did it just for my sake I wont say I aint glad I am
in one way But twant necessary and twas too much too hard for you
altogether

Dont say that she begged Too much I never can do enough Compared
to what you have done for me itit Oh please let me do what little
I can But Uncle Elisha promise me one thing promise that you will
not ask me to meet him if he should come That I couldnt do even for
you




CHAPTER XXI


Promises of that kind are easier to make than to keep The captain
promised promptly enough but the Fates were against him He made it his
business to go to town the very next day and called upon his friend He
found the young man in a curiously excited and optimistic frame of mind
radically different from that of the past few months The manuscript of
the novel was before him on the desk also plenty of blank paper
His fountainpen was in his hand although apparently he had written
nothing that morning But he was going tooh yes he was going to He
was feeling just in the mood He had read his manuscript and it was not
so bad by George some of the stuff was pretty good And the end
was not so far off Five or six chapters more and the thing would be
finished He would have to secure a publisher of course but two had
already expressed an interest and so on

Captain Elisha drew his own conclusions He judged that his nieces
letter had reached its destination He did not mention it however nor
did Pearson But when the captain hinted at the latters running out to
the house to see him some time or other the invitation was accepted

Thats fine Jim declared the visitor Come any time I want you
to see what a nice little place Ive got out there Dont stand on
ceremony comeernext week say Then mindful of his promise he
added You and Ill have it all to ourselves Ive been callatin to
hire a sailboat for the summer got my eye on a capable little sloop
belongin to a feller on the Sound shore If all goes well Ill close
the deal in a few days Ill meet you at the depot and well have a sail
and get dinner at a hotel or somewheres and then well come up to the
house and take a whack at Capn Jims doins in the new chapters Just
you and I together in the settin room hey

Pearson did not seem so enthusiastic over this programme although he
admitted that it sounded tiptop

How is Miss Warren he asked mentioning the name with a nonchalance
remarkable considering that he had not done so before for weeks She
is well I hope

Yes shes fustrate thank you Very well everything considered She
keeps to herself a good deal Dont care to meet many folks and you
cant hardly blame her

Pearson admitted that and the remainder of the call was largely a
monologue by Captain Elisha

Well then Jim said the latter when he rose to go you come up
Monday or Tuesday of next week Will you

Yes II think so

Dont think do it Let me know what train youre comin on and Ill
meet you at the depot

This last remark was what upset calculations Pearson came on Monday
having written the day before He did not mail the note himself but
trusted it to Mrs Hepton who was going out to attend evening service
She forgot it until the next day So it happened that when he alighted
from the train at the suburban station the captain was not there to
meet him He waited a while and then inquiring the way of the station
agent walked up to the house by himself As he turned in at the front
walk Caroline came out of the door They met face to face

It was a most embarrassing situation particularly for Caroline yet
with feminine resourcefulness she dissembled her embarrassment to some
extent and acknowledged his stammered Good afternoon Miss Warren
with a cool almost cold How do you do Mr Pearson which chilled
his pleasure at seeing her and made him wish devoutly that he had not
been such a fool as to come However there he was and he hastily
explained his presence by telling her of the captains invitation for
that day how he had expected to meet him at the station and not
meeting him had walked up to the house

Is he in he asked

No Captain Elisha was not in He had gone to see the sailboat man Not
hearing from his friend he concluded the latter would not come until
the next day

He will be so sorry said Caroline

Pearson was rather thankful than otherwise The captains absence
afforded him an opportunity to escape from a place where he was plainly
unwelcome

Oh never mind he said It is not important I can run out
another day Just tell him I called Miss Warren please that I wrote
yesterday but my letter must have gone astray Good afternoon

He was turning to go but she stopped him She had fully made up her
mind that when he came she would not meet himremembering how she had
treated him on the evening of her birthday she would be ashamed to
look him in the face Besides she could not meet him after writing that
letter it would be too brazen he would thinkall sorts of things
When he visited her uncle she would remain in her room or go to the
city or somewhere

But now she had met him And he had come in response to her uncles
invitation given because she herself had pleaded that it should be To
let him go away would be rude and ridiculous and how could she explain
to the captain

You mustnt go Mr Pearson she said You must come in and wait
Captain Warren will be back soon Im sure

Thank you but I think I wont wait I can come another time

But you must wait I insist Uncle Elisha will be dreadfully
disappointed if you dont There isnt a train for an hour and he will
return before that I am sure Please come in

Pearson was reluctant but he could think of no reasonable excuse So he
entered the house removed his overcoat and hat and seated himself in
the living room to await the captains return Caroline excused herself
saying that she had an errand at the shop in the village She made that
errand as long as she could but when she returned he was still there
and Captain Elisha had not appeared

The conversation was forced for a time Each felt the embarrassment
and Pearson was still resentful of the manner in which she had greeted
him on his arrival But as he looked at her the resentment vanished
and the other feeling that which he had determined to forget returned
Captain Elisha had told him how brave she had been through it all and
contrasting the little house with the former home remembering the loss
of friends and fortune to say nothing of the unmasking of those whom
she believed were her nearest and dearest he wondered and admired more
than ever He understood how very hard it must have been for her to
write that letter to him a letter in which she justified his course
at the cost of her own fathers honor He longed to tell her that he
understood and appreciated

At last he could not resist the temptation

Miss Warren he said please excuse my speaking of this but I must
I must thank you for writing me as you did It was not necessary it
was too much to expect too hard a thing for you to do It makes me feel
guilty I

Please dont she interrupted Dont speak in that way It was right
It was what I should have done long ago

But it was not necessary I understood I knew you had heard another
version of the story and that you felt I had been ungrateful and mean
to say the least in my conduct toward your father I knew that I have
never blamed you And you writing as you did

I did it for my uncles sake she broke in quickly You are his
closest friend

I know but I appreciate it nevertheless II wish you would consider
me your friend as well as his I do sincerely

Thank you I need friends I know I have few now which is not
strange rather bitterly

He protested earnestly I did not mean it in that way he said It
is an honor and a great privilege to be one of your friends I had that
honor and privilege once May I have it again

Thank you Mr Pearson Now tell me about your novel I remember
it all so well And I am very much interested You must have it nearly
completed Tell me about it please

They were deep in the discussion of the novel when Captain Elisha walked
into the living room He was surprised stating his feelings at their
mildest to find them together but he did not express his astonishment
Instead he hailed Pearson delightedly demanded to know if they had
dared tackle Capn Jim without the head doctors being on the scene
and insisted upon the authors admitting him to the clinic forthwith
Pearson did not take the next train nor the next Instead he stayed
for dinner and well into the evening and when he did go it was after a
prompt acceptance of the captains invitation to come again in a mighty
little while

Caroline when she and her uncle were alone after their visitors
departure made no protest against the invitation having been given
She did not speak of Pearson at all Captain Elisha also talked of other
things principally about the sailboat the summer lease of which he
had arranged that afternoon He declared the sloop to be an able craft
of her tonnage and that they would have some good times aboard her or
he missed his guess In his own room when ready for bed he favored his
reflection in the glass with a broad smile and a satisfied wink from
which proceeding it may be surmised that the day had not been a bad one
according to his estimate

Pearson came again a week later and thereafter frequently The sessions
with Capn Jim and his associates were once more regular happenings
to be looked forward to and enjoyed by the three As the weather grew
warmer the sloopCaptain Elisha had the name she formerly bore painted
out and Caroline substitutedproved to be as great a source of pleasure
as her new skipper had prophesied He and his nieceand occasionally
Pearsonsailed and picnicked on the Sound and Carolines pallor
disappeared under the influence of breeze and sunshine Her health
improved and her spirits also She seemed at times almost happy
and her uncle seldom saw her as after the removal to the suburb he
so frequently used with tears in her eyes and the sadness of bitter
memories in her expression and manner Her work at the University grew
steadily more difficult but she enjoyed it thoroughly and declared that
she would not give it up for worlds

In June two very important events took place The novel was finished
and Stephen his Sophomore year at an end came home from college He
had been invited by some classmates to spend a part of his vacation with
them on the Maine coast and his guardian had consented to his doing so
but the boy himself had something else to propose On an evening soon
after his return when his sister having retired he was alone with the
captain he broached the idea

Say he said Ive been thinking a good deal while Ive been away
this last time

Glad to hear it Im sure replied his uncle dryly

Yes Ive been thinkingabout a good many things Im flat broke down
and out so far as money is concerned Thats so isnt it

Captain Elisha looked at him keenly for an instant Then

It appears that way Im afraid he answered What made you ask

Nothing I wasnt asking really I was just stating the case Now the
way I look at it this college course of mine isnt worth while Youre
putting up for it and I ought to be much obliged I am of course

Youre welcome Stevie

I know but whats the use of it Ive got to go to work when its
over And the kind of work I want to do doesnt need university
training Im just wasting time thats what Im doing

Humph I aint so sure about that But what sort of work do you want to
do

I want to be down on the Street as the governor was If this Rubber
Company business hadnt knocked us out I intended as soon as I was of
age to take that seat of his and start in for myself Well that chance
has gone but I mean to get in some way though I have to start at the
foot of the ladder Now why cant I leave college and start now It will
be two years gained wont it

Captain Elisha seemed pleased but he shook his head

How do you know youd like it he asked Youve never tried

No I never have but Ill like it all right I know I shall Its what
Ive wanted to do ever since I was old enough to think of such things
Just let me start in now right away and Ill show you Ill make good
you see if I dont

He was very earnest The captain deliberated before answering

Stevie he said doubtfully I rather like to hear you talk that
way I own up it pleases me But as to your givin up collegethats
different Let me think it over for a day or two that is if you can
put off the Maine trip so long as that

Hang the Maine trip You let me get into business the business I want
to get into and I wont ask for a vacation you can bet on that

All right then Ill think and do some questionin around and report
soons Ive decided whats best

He laid the stump of his cigar in the ash receiver and rose from his
chair But his nephew had not finished

There was something else I intended to say he announced but with
less eagerness

That so What

Whywhy just this He fidgeted with his watch chain colored and
was evidently uneasy I guess he hesitatedI guess that I havent
treated you as I ought

I want to know You guess that hey Why

Oh you know why Ive been thinking since I went back to New Haven
Ive had a chance to think Some of the fellows in the set I used to be
thick with up there have learned that Im broke and theythey arent
as friendly as they were Not all of them of course but some And
I wouldnt chase after them not much If they wanted to drop me they
could You bet I didnt try to hang on I was pretty sore for a while
and kept to myself andwell I did a lot of thinking I guess Caro is
right youve been mighty decent to her and me

He paused but Captain Elisha made no comment

I guess you have continued Stephen soberly When you first came
you know Caroline and I couldnt understand We thought you were
butting in and werent our sort andand

And a hayseed nuisance generally I know Heave ahead son you
interest me

Well we didnt like it And Mal Dunn and his mother were always
sympathizing and insinuating and we believed they were our best
friends and all that So we didnt try to understand you oror even
make it livable for you Then after the news came that the money had
gone I acted like a kid I guess That business of making Mal stick
to the engagement was pretty silly I was nearly desperate you see
andandyou knew it was silly You never took any stock in it did
you

The captain smiled

Not a heap he admitted

No All you wanted was to show them up Well you did it and Im glad
you did But Caro and I have talked it over since Ive been home and
we agree that youve been a great deal better to us than we deserve You
didnt _have_ to take care of us at all any more after the money went
By gad considering how we treated you I dont see why you did _I_
wouldnt But you didand you are Youve given us a home and youre
putting me through college andand

Thats all right son Good night

Just a minute IIwell if you let me Id like to thank you
andand ask your pardon

Granted my boy And never mind the thanks either Just keep on
thinkin and actin as you have tonight and Ill be satisfied I want
to see my nephew makin a man of himselfa real man and Steve you
talk more like a man tonight than Ive ever heard you Stick to it and
youll do yet As for goin to work you let me chew on that for a few
days

The next morning he called on Sylvester who in turn took him to a
friend of his a brokeremploying a goodsized staff of clerks The
three had a consultation followed the day after by another That
evening the captain made a definite proposal to Stephen It was
briefly that while not consenting to the latters leaving college he
did consider that a trial of the work in a brokers office might be
a good thing Therefore if the young man wished he could enter the
employ of Sylvesters friend and remain during July and August

Youll leave about the first of September Steve he said and
thatll give you time for the two weeks vacation that you ought to have
Then you can go back to Yale and pitch in till the next summer when the
same jobll be ready for you After youre through college for good if
what youve learned about brokerin aint cured you of your likin for
itif you still want to go ahead with it for your life job thenwell
then well see What do you say

Stephen had a good deal to say principally in the line of objection to
continuing his studies Finding these objections unavailing he agreed
to his guardians proposition

All right said the captain then you can go to work next Monday But
youll _have_ to work and be just the same as any other beginner no
better and no worse Therell be no favoritism and if youre really
wuth your salt you wont want any Show em and me that youre wuth
it

The novel the wonderful tale which Captain Elisha was certain would
make its author famous was finished that very day in June when Stephen
came back from New Haven The question of title remained and the
clinic now reenforced by Stevewhose dislike for Pearson
had apparently vanished with others of his former likes and
dislikesconsidered that at several sessions At last The Man at the
Wheel was selected as indicating something of the heros profession
and implying perhaps a hint of his character Then came the
fateful task of securing a publisher And the first to whom it was
submittedone of the two firms which had already expressed a desire to
read the manuscriptaccepted it at what for a first novel were
very fair terms During the summer there was proof to be read and
illustrations to be criticized Captain Elisha did not wholly approve of
the artists productions

Jerushy he exclaimed look at that mainmast Look at the rake of it
More like a yacht than a deepwater bark she is enough sight And the
fust mates got a uniform cap on like a purser on a steamboat Make
that artist feller take that cap off him Jim Hes got to I wish he
could have seen some of my mates They want Cunarder dudes but they
could make a crew hop round like a sandflea in a clam bake

Or when the picture happened to be a shore view

What kind of a house is that Did you ever see a house like that
DownEast Ill leave it to anybody if it dont look like a sugar mans
plantation I used to know down Mobile way All that feller standin
by the door needs is to have his face blacked then hed start singin
Swanee River This aint Uncle Toms Cabin Bah

The advance copy the first one was ready early in September and the
author of course brought it immediately to his friends They found
the dedication especially interesting To C W and E W consulting
specialists at the literary clinics with grateful acknowledgments
Probably Captain Elisha was never prouder of anything even his first
command than of that dedication

And the story when at last it appeared for sale was almost from the
beginning a success The reviewers praised it the reading publicthat
final court of appeal which makes or unmakes novelstook kindly to it
and discussed and recommended it and most important of all perhaps
it sold and continued to sell There was something in it its humanity
its simplicity its clearly marked characters which made a hit Pearson
no longer needed to seek publishers they sought him His short stories
were bid for by the magazines and his prices climbed and climbed
He found himself suddenly planted in the middle of the highway to
prosperity with a clear road ahead of him provided he continued to do
his best

In September Stephen gave up his work at the brokers office spent the
weeks with his friends in Maine and then returned to Yale He gave up
the position on the Street with reluctance He was sure he liked it
now he declared It was what he was fitted for and he meant more than
ever to take it up permanently as soon as he was free And his employer
told Captain Elisha that the youngster was bright clever and apt A
little conceited needs taking down occasionally but that is the only
trouble He has been spoiled I should imagine he said

Yup replied the captain with emphasis your imaginations a good
one It dont need cultivatin any

The novel being out of the way and its successor not yet far enough
advanced in plot or general plan for much discussion the literary
clinics were no longer as frequent But Pearsons visits to the Warren
house were not discontinued All summer long he had been coming out
once and usually twice a week Captain Elisha had told him not to
stand on formality to come any time and he did On most of these
occasions he found the captain at home but if only Caroline was there
he seemed quite contented She did not remark on the frequency of his
visits In fact she mentioned him less and less in conversation with
her uncle But as the autumn came and moved towards its prime she
seemed to the captains noticing eye a trifle more grave a little
more desirous of being by herself Sometimes he found her sitting by
the open firepleasant in the cool October eveningsand gazing very
soberly at the blaze She had been in good spirits more merry and
lighthearted than he had ever seen her during the latter part of
the summer now her old sadness seemed to be returning It would have
troubled him this change in her mood if he had not believed he knew
the cause

He was planning a glorious Thanksgiving At least it would be glorious
to him for he intended spending the day and several days at his own
home in South Denboro Abbie Baker had made him promise to do it and he
had agreed He would not leave Caroline of course she was going with
him Steve would be there though he would not come until Thanksgiving
Day itself Sylvester also would be of the party he seemed delighted
at the opportunity

Im curious to see the place where they raise fellows like you the
lawyer said It must be worth looking at

Graves dont think so chuckled the captain I invited him and
he said No thank you so quick that the words was all telescoped
together And he shivered too when he said it just as if he felt
that souwest gale whistlin between his bones even now I told him
Id pretty nigh guarantee that no more trees would fall on him but it
didnt have any effect

Pearson was asked and had accepted His going was so far a settled thing
that he had commissioned Captain Elisha to purchase a stateroom for him
on the Fall River boat for of course the captain would not consider
their traveling the entire distance by train At an interview in the
young mans room in the boarding house only three days before the date
set for the start he had been almost as enthusiastic as the Cape Codder
himself The pair had planned several side excursions time and weather
permitting among them a trip across the Sound to Setuckit Point with
the possibility of some late seafowl shooting and a long tramp to one
of the lifesaving stations where Pearson hoped to pick up material for
his new book He was all anticipation and enthusiasm when the captain
left him and said he would run out to the house the following day to
make final arrangements

That day Sylvester phoned asking Captain Elisha to come to his office
on a matter of business When having done so the captain returning
alighted at his home station he was surprised to see Pearson standing
on the platform

Why hello Jim he exclaimed What are you doing here Just come
have you

His friend shook his head No Captain Warren he said Im just
going

Goin What for Been up to the house of course Caroline told you
where Id gone and that I was callatin to hurry back didnt she

Yes

Well then course you aint goin Youre goin to stay to dinner
Ive got some things to tell you about that lifesavin station cruise
Ive been thinkin that I know the capn and most of the crew on the
lightship off back of the Point Howd you like to go aboard of her You
could get some yarns from those fellers that might be wuth hearin

I have no doubt I should But Im afraid I cant go The fact is
Captain Ive decided not to spend Thanksgiving with you after all

Hey Captain Elisha could scarcely believe he had heard correctly
You cant goto South Denboro

No

Why not for the land sakes

Well Ive decidedIve decided not to

But Jim Why I cant have it so Im dreadful disappointed Ive
counted on your goin So has Abbie Shes read your book and she says
shes crazy to see the feller that wrote it Shes told the minister
and a whole lot more and theyre all comin in to look at you Taint
often we have a celebrated character in our town Youve _got_ to go

Thank you Captain I appreciate the invitation and your kindness
but with decision I cant accept

Cant you come later Say Thanksgivin mornin Or even the day after

No

But why not Whats the matter with you all of a sudden Come here let
me look at you

He took the young man by the arm and led him almost by main strength
close to the lighted window of the station It was late and the
afternoon was gloomy Here by the lamplight streaming through the
window he could see his face more clearly He looked at it

Humph he grunted after a moments scrutiny Youve made up your
mind I can see that Have you told Caroline Does she know

Yes Youll have to excuse me Captain Warren my train is coming

What did she say

Pearson smiled but there was little mirth in the smile I think she
agrees with me that it is best he observed

Humph She does hey I want to know Look here Jim have you and
she

He got no further for Pearson broke away and with a hurried Good
night strode up the platform to meet the citybound train Captain
Elisha watched it go and then walked slowly homeward his hands in his
pockets troubled and wondering

He entered the house by the back door a remnant of South Denboro habit
and found Annie in the kitchen

Wheres Caroline he asked

Shes in the living room sir I think Mr Pearson has been here and
just gone

Umhm So I heard Say Annie you neednt hurry dinner I aint ready
for it yet awhile

He hung his coat and hat in the back hall and quietly entered the living
room The lamp was not lighted and the room was dark but he saw his
niece a shadowy figure seated by the window He crossed to her side

Well Caroline he said cheerfully Im home again

She turned I see you are she answered

Humph your eyes must be better than mine then I cant see anything in
here Its darker than a niggers pocket Suppose we turn on the glim

He struck a match as he said it By its light he saw her face The match
burned down to his finger tips and then he extinguished it

I dont know but the dark is just as good and more economical he
observed No use of encouragin the graspin ile trust unless its
necessary Lets you and me sit here in the dark and talk No objection
to talkin to your back country relation have you

No

Thats good Well Caroline Im goin to talk plain again You can
order me to close my hatch any time you feel like it thats skippers
privilege and youre boss of this craft you know Dearie I just met
Jim Pearson He tells me hes decided not to go on this Cape cruise of
ours He said you agreed with him twas best he shouldnt go Do you
mind tellin me why

She did not answer He waited a minute and then continued

Course I know I aint got any real right to ask he went on but I
think more of you and Jim than I do of anybody else and so maybe youll
excuse me Have you and he had a fallin out

Still she was silent He sighed Well he observed I see you have
and I dont blame you for not wantin to talk about it Im awful sorry
Id begun to hope that However well change the subject Or we
wont talk at all if youd rather not

Another pause Then she laid her hand on his

Uncle she said you know I always want to talk to you And as for
the right to ask you have the right to ask anything of me at any time
And I should have told you of my own accord by and by Mr Pearson and
I have not quarreled but I thinkI think it best that I should not see
him again

You do Not see himany moreat all Why Caroline

Not for a long long time at least It would only make it harderfor
him and its of no use

Captain Elisha sighed again I guess I understand Caroline I presume
likely I do Hehe asked somethin of youand you couldnt say yes to
him That was it I suppose Neednt tell me unless you really want to
you understand he added hastily

But I do I ought to tell you I should have told you before and
perhaps if I had he would not have  Uncle Elisha Mr Pearson asked
me to be his wife

The captain gave no evidence of surprise

Yes he replied gravely I judged that was it And you told him you
couldnt I suppose Well dearie thats a question nobody ought to
answer but the one Shes the only one that knows what that answer
should be and when other folks interfere and try to influence it
generally means trouble Im kind of disappointed Ill own up to that
I think Jim is a fine honest able young man and hed make a good
husband Im sure And so far as his business or profession or
whatever you call it goes hes doin pretty well and sartin to do
better Of course twant that that kept you from

Uncle Elisha Am _I_ so rich that I should

There there my girl I know twant that of course I was only
thinkin out loud thats alltryin to find reasons You didnt care
for him enough I suppose Caroline you dont care for anybody else do
you You dont still care for that other feller that

Uncle she sprang up hurt and indignant How can you she cried
How could you ask that What must you think of me

Please Caroline he protested please dont I beg your pardon I
was a fool I knew better Dont go Tell me the real reason Sit down
again and lets talk this out Do sit down thats it Now tell me was
it that you couldnt care for Jim enough

She hesitated

Was it he repeated

II like Mr Pearson very much I respect and admire him

But you dont love him I see Well sadly theres another one of my
dreams gone to smash However you did just right dearie Feelin that
way you couldnt marry him of course

He would have risen now and she detained him

That was not the reason she said in a low tone

Hey he bent toward her What he cried That want the reason
you say You do care for him

She was silent

Do you he repeated gently And yet you sent him away Why

She faltered tried to speak and then turned away He put his arm about
her and stroked her hair

Dont you cry dearie he begged I wont bother you any more You
can tell me some other timeif you want to Or you neednt tell me
at all Its all right only dont cry Cause if you do with sudden
determination I shall cry too and bein as I aint used to the
exercise I may raise such a row that Anniell send for the constable
You wouldnt want that to happen I know

This unexpected announcement had the desired effect Caroline laughed
hysterically and freed herself from his arm

I mustnt be so silly she said I had made up my mind to tell you
everything and I shall My not caring for Mr Pearson was not my reason
for refusing him The reasons were twoyou and Steve

Me and Steve What in the world have we got to do with it

Everything He would marry me poor as I am and perhaps Iperhaps
I should say yes if things were different Oh there is no use my
deceiving you or trying to deceive myself I know I should say yes and
be very very happy But I cant and I wont I _wont_

But why And where for mercys sake do Steve and I come in

Uncle Elisha I suppose you think I have been perfectly satisfied to
let you take care of me and of my brother and give us a home and all
that we needed and more No doubt you thought me selfish enough to be
contented with that and go on as I amas we areliving on your bounty
You had reason to think so But I have not been contented with that nor
has Steve He and I have made our plans and we shall carry them out He
will leave college in two years and go to work in earnest Before that
time I shall be ready to teach I have been studying with just that idea
in view

Good land Why no you aint Youve been studyin to help me and
Annie run this house

That was only part of itthe smallest part I havent told you before
Uncle but one of the Domestic Science teachers at the University is a
girl I used to know slightly She is going to be married next year and
if all goes well I may be appointed to her position when she leaves I
have a conditional promise already If I am why then you see I shall
really be earning my own living you will not have to give up your own
home and all your interests there to make me comfortable you can

Here here Captain Elisha put in desperately dont talk so
ridiculous Caroline I aint givin up anything I never was more happy
than Ive been right here with you this summer Im satisfied

I know but I am not And neither is Steve He and I have planned it
all His salary at first will be small and so will mine But together
we can earn enough to live somehow and later on when he earns more
perhaps we may be able to repay a little of all that you have given us
We shall try _I_ shall insist upon it

Caroline Warren is _that_ the reason you sent Jim away Did you tell
him that Did you tell him you wouldnt marry him on account of me

No of course I did not indignantly I told himI said I must not
think of marriage it was impossible And it is You _know_ it is Uncle
Elisha

I dont know any such thing If you want to make me happy Caroline
you couldnt find a better way than to be Jim Pearsons wife And you
would be happy too you said so

But I am not thinking of happiness It is my dutyto you and to my own
selfrespect And not only that but to Steve Someone must provide a
home for him Neither he nor I will permit you to do it a day longer
than is necessary I am his sister and I shall not leave him

But you wont have to leave him Steves futures all fixed Ive
provided for Steve

What do you mean

What I say The captain was very much excited and for once
completely off his guard Ive had plans for Steve all along Hes
doin fustrate in that brokers office learnin the trade Next summer
hell have another whack at it and learn more When hes out of college
Im goin to turn over your dads seat on the Stock Exchange to him Not
give it to him you knownot right offbut let him try and then if
he makes a good fist at it hell have it permanent Steves got the
best chance in the world He couldnt ask much better seems to me You
aint got to fret yourself about Steve

He paused almost out of breath He had been speaking rapidly so as to
prevent interruption Carolines astonishment was too great for words
just then Her uncle anxiously awaited her reply

You see dont you he asked You understand Steves goin to have
the chance to make a good livin at the very thing he declares hes set
on doin I aint told him and I dont want you to but its what Ive
planned for him and

Wait wait Uncle please The Stock Exchange seat Fathers seat I
dont see I dont understand

Yes yes eagerly your pas seat Ive meant it for Steve Theres
been chances enough to sell it but I wouldnt do that Twas for him
Caroline and hes goin to have it

But I dont see how Why I thought

The door of the dining room opened Annie appeared on the threshold

Dinner is served she announced

Be right there Annie Now you see that you aint got to worry about
Steve dont you Caroline

His niece did not answer By the light from the doorway he saw that she
was gazing at him with a strange expression She looked as if she was
about to ask another question He waited but she did not ask it

Well he said rising we wont talk any more just now Annies
soups gettin cold and shell be in our wool if we dont have dinner
Afterwards we can have another session Come Caroline

She also rose but hesitated Uncle Elisha she said will you excuse
me if I dont talk any more tonight And if you dont mind I wont
dine with you Im not hungry andand my head aches Ill go to my
room I think

Yes yes he said hastily of course Im afraid Ive talked too
much as tis You go up and lie down and Annie can fetch you some toast
and tea or somethin by and by But do just answer me this Caroline if
you can When you told Jim marryin was out of the question for you did
he take that as final Was he contented with that Didnt he say he was
willin to wait for you or anything

Yes he said he would wait always But I told him he must not And I
told him he must go and not see me again I couldnt see him as I have
been doing Uncle I couldnt

I know dearie I know But didnt you say anything more Didnt you
give him _any_ hope

I said she hesitated and added in a whisper I said if I should
ever need him oror change my mind I would send for him I shouldnt
have said it It was weak and wicked of me but I said it Please let me
go now Uncle dear Good night

She kissed him and hurried away He ate his lonely dinner
absentmindedly and with little appetite After it was finished he sat
in the living room the lamp still unlighted smoking and thinking

And in her chamber Caroline too sat thinkingnot altogether of the
man she loved and who loved her She thought of him of course but
there was something else an idea a suspicion which over and over
again she dismissed as an utter impossibility but which returned as
often

The Stock Exchange seat had been a part of her fathers estate a
part of her own and Steves inheritance Sylvester had told her so
distinctly And such a seat was valuable she remembered her brother
reading in the paper that one had recently sold for ninety thousand
dollars How could Captain Warren have retained such a costly part of
the forfeited estate in his possession For it was in his possession
he was going to give it to her brother when the latter left college But
how could he have obtained it Not by purchase for as she knew he was
not worth half of ninety thousand dollars Surely the creditor the man
who had as was his right seized all Rodgers Warrens effects would
not have left that and taken the rest Not unless he was a curiously
philanthropic and eccentric person Who was he Who was this mysterious
man her father had defrauded She had never wished to know before now
she did And the more she pondered the more plausible her suspicion
became It was almost incredible it seemed preposterous but as she
went back in memory over the events since her fathers death and the
disclosure of his astonishing will little bits of evidence little
happenings and details came to light trifles in themselves but all
fitting in together like pieces of an inscription in mosaic to spell
the truth




CHAPTER XXII


November weather on Cape Cod is what Captain Elisha described as
considerable chancey The feller that can guess it two days ahead
of time he declared is wastin his talents he could make a livin
prophesyin most anything even the market price of cranberries When
Caroline Sylvester and the captain reached South Denboro after what
seemed to the two unused to the leisurely winter schedule of the
railroad an interminable journey from Fall River the girl thought
she had never seen a more gloomy sky or a more forbidding scene
Gray clouds gray sea brown bare fields the village of white or
grayshingled houses set for the most part along the winding main
street the elms and silverleaf poplars waving bare branches in the
cutting wind a picture of the fag end of loneliness and desolation so
it looked to her She remembered Mr Gravess opinion of the place as
jokingly reported by Sylvester and she sympathized with the dignified
junior partner

But she kept her feelings hidden on her uncles account The captain
was probably the happiest individual in the state of Massachusetts that
morning He hailed the trains approach to Sandwich as the entrance to
Ostable County the promised land and from that station on excitedly
pointed out familiar landmarks and bits of scenery and buildings with
the gusto and enthusiasm of a school boy

Thats Ostable courthouse he cried pointing And seesee that
redroofed house right over there just past that white church Thats
where Judge Baxter lives a mighty good friend of mine the Judge is I
stopped to his house to dinner the night Graves came

A little further on he added Twas about here that I spoke to Graves
fust I noticed him sittin right across the aisle from me with a face
on him sour as a sasser of green tamarind preserves and I thought Id
be sociable Tough night I says Umph says he Twant a remark
callated to encourage conversation so I didnt try againnot till his
umbrella turned inside out on the Denboro platform Ho ho I wish youd
have seen his face _then_

At Denboro he pointed out Pete Shattucks livery stable where the horse
and buggy came from which had been the means of transporting Graves and
himself to South Denboro

See he cried See that feller holdin up the corner of the depot
with his back the one thats so broad in the beam he has to draw in his
breath afore he can button his coat Thats Pete Youd think he was too
sleepy to care whether twas today or next week wouldnt you Well if
you was a summer boarder and wanted to hire a team youd find Pete was
awake and got up early If a tencent piece fell off the shelf in the
middle of the night hed hear it though Ive known him to sleep while
the ministers barn burned down The parson had been preachin against
horsetradin maybe that sermon was responsible for some of the
morphine influence

Sylvester was enjoying himself hugely Captain Elishas exuberant
comments were great fun for him This is what I came for he confided
to Caroline I dont care if it rains or snows I could sit and listen
to your uncle for a year and never tire Hes a wonder And Im crazy to
see that housekeeper of his If she lives up to her reputation therell
be no disappointment in my Thanksgiving celebration

Dan the captains hired man met them with the carriage at the station
and Miss Baker met them at the door of the Warren home The exterior
of the big oldfashioned rambling house was inviting and homelike
in spite of the gloomy weather and Caroline cheered up a bit when they
turned in at the gate Five minutes of Miss Abigails society and all
gloom disappeared One could not be gloomy where Miss Abbie was Her
smile of welcome was so broad that as her employer said it took in
all outdoor and some of Punkhorn Neck a place which he hastened to
add was forgot durin creation and has sort of happened of itself
since

Abbie conducted Caroline to her roomoldfashioned like the rest of
the house but cozy warm and cheeryand after helping in the removal
of her wraps seized her by both hands and took a long look at her face

Youll excuse my bein so familiar on short acquaintance dearie she
said but Ive heard so much about you that I feels if I knew you like
own folks And you are own folks aint you Course you are Everyone of
Lishas letters have had four pages of you to one of anything else I
begun to think New York was nothin but you and a whole lot of tenstory
houses He thinks so much of you that Id be jealous if I had that
kind of disposition and the time to spare So I must have a good look at
you I declare youre almost prettier than he said May I kiss you
Id like to

Illustration I declare youre almost prettier than he said May I
kiss you

She did and they were friends at once

The rest of that day and evening were busy times Captain Elisha showed
his visitors about the place the barn the cows the pigpenthe pig
himself had gone to fulfill the unhappy destiny of pigs but they would
meet him by sections later on so the captain assured them The house
and buildings were spotless in paint and whitewash the yard was raked
clean of every dead leaf and twig the whole establishment was so neat
that Caroline remarked upon it

It looks as if it had been scoured she said

Umhm observed her uncle with a gratified nod thats Abbie She
hates dirt worse than she does laziness and that aint sayin a little
I tell her shed sandsoap the weather vane if she could climb up to
it as tis she stays below and superintends Dan while he does it If
godliness wants to stay next to cleanliness when shes around it has
to keep on the jump I always buy shirts two degrees heaviern I need
cause I know shell have em scrubbed thin in a fortnit When it comes
to _real_ Domestic Science Caroline Abbie aint in the back row of the
primer class now I tell you

Miss Baker had planned that her young guest should sit in state with
folded hands in the parlor She seemed to consider that the proper
conduct for a former member of New Yorks best society She was shocked
when the girl volunteered to help her about the house

Course I shant let you she said The ideaand you company Got
more help than I know what to do with as tis Lisha was determined
that I should hire a girl to wash dishes and things while you was here
Nothin would do but that So I got Annabel Havens daughter Etta G
Theres fourteen in that family and the land knows twas an act of
charity takin one appetite out of the house Pay her fifty cents a day
I do and shes out in the kitchen makin believe wash windows They
dont need washin but she was lookin out of em most of the time so
I thought she might as well combine business with pleasure

But Caroline refused to sit in the parlor and be company She insisted
upon helping Miss Baker protested and declared there was nothing on
earth to be done but her guest insisted that if there was not she
herself must sit As Abbie would have as soon thought of attending
church without wearing her jet earrings as she would of sitting down
before dinner she gave in after a while and permitted Caroline to
help in arranging the table

Why you do fustrate she exclaimed in surprise You know where
everything ought to go just as if youd been settin table all your
life And you aint because Lisha wrote you used to keep hired help
two or three of em all the time

Caroline laughed

Ive been studying housekeeping for almost a year she said

Studyin it Why yes now I remember Lisha wrote youd been studyin
some kind of science at college Twant settin table science I
guess though Ha ha

That was part of it She explained the course briefly Abigail
listened in amazement

And they teach thatat school she demanded And take money for it
And call it _science_ My land I guess I was brought up in a scientific
household then I was the only girl in the family and mother died when
I was ten years old

After dinner she consented to sit for a time though not until she had
donned her Sunday best earrings and all Captain Elisha and Sylvester
sat with them and the big fireplace in the sitting room blazed and
roared as it had not since its owner left for his long sojourn in the
city In the evening callers came the Congregational minister and
his wife and some of the neighbors The latter were pleasant country
people another retired sea captain among them and they all seemed to
have great respect and liking for Captain Elisha and to be very glad to
welcome him home The two captains spun salt water yarns and the lawyer
again decided that he was getting just what he had come for They left
a little after nine and Caroline said good night and went to her room
She was tired mentally and physically

But she did not fall asleep at once Her mind was still busy with the
suspicion which her uncles words concerning his future plans for Steve
had aroused She had thought of little else since she heard them The
captain did not mention the subject again possibly on reflection
he decided that he had already said too much And she asked no more
questions She determined not to question himyet She must think
first and then ask someone elseSylvester He knew the truth and if
taken by surprise might be driven into confession if there should be
anything to confess She was waiting for an opportunity to be alone with
him and that opportunity had not yet presented itself

The captain would have spoken further with her concerning James Pearson
He was eager to do that But her mind was made up she had sent her
lover away and it was best for both She must forget him if she could
So when her uncle would have spoken on that subject she begged him not
to and he respecting her feelings and believing that to urge would be
bad policy refrained

But to forget she found was an impossibility In the excitement of the
journey and the arrival amid new surroundings she had managed to
keep up a show of good spirits but now alone once more with the wind
singing mournfully about the gables and rattling the windows she was
sad and so lonely She thought what her life had once promised to be and
what it had become She did not regret the old life that life she had
known before her father died she had been happy in it while he lived
but miserable after his death As for happiness she had been happy
that summer happy with her uncle and withhim And with him now even
though they would be poor as she was used to reckoning poverty she
knew she could be very happy She wondered what he was doing then if he
was thinking of her She ought to hope that he was not because it was
useless but she wished that he might be nevertheless Then she told
herself that all this was wicked she had made up her mind she must be
true to the task she had set duty to her brother and uncle

Her uncle why had her uncle done all this for her And why had her
father made him their guardian These were old questions but now she
asked them with a new significance If that strange suspicion of hers
was true it would explain so much it would explain almost everything
But it could not be true if it was why had he not told her when the
discovery of her fathers dishonesty and of the note forfeiting the
estate was made Why had he not told her then That was what troubled
her most It did not seem like him to do such a thingnot like his
character at all Therefore it could not be true Yet she must know
She resolved to question Sylvester the next day if possible And so
resolving she at last fell asleep

Her opportunity came the following morning the day before Thanksgiving
After breakfast Captain Elisha went downtown to call on some
acquaintances He invited Caroline and the lawyer to accompany him but
they refused the latter because he judged his a strangers presence
during the calls would be something of a hindrance to good fellowship
and the discussion of town affairs which the captain was counting on
and Caroline because she saw her chance for the interview she so much
desired

After the captain had gone Sylvester sat down before the fire in the
sitting room to read the Boston _Transcript_ As he sat there Caroline
entered and closed the door behind her Miss Abigail was in the kitchen
busy with preparations for the morrows plum pudding

The girl took the chair next that occupied by the lawyer He put down
his paper and turned to her

Well he asked how does this Cape Cod air effect your appetite
Caroline Im ashamed of mine Im rather glad tomorrow is
Thanksgiving on that day I believe it is permissible even
commendable to eat three times more than a selfrespecting person
ordinarily should

She smiled but her answer was in the form of another question and
quite irrelevant

Mr Sylvester she said I wish you would tell me something about the
value of a seat on the Stock Exchange What is the price of one

The lawyer looked at her in surprise

The value of a seat on the Stock Exchange he repeated

Yes what does it cost to buy one

He hesitated wondering why she should be interested in that subject
Captain Elisha had not told him a word of the interview following
Pearsons last visit He wondered and then surmised a reasonStephen
of course Steves ambition was to be a broker and his sister was
doubtless with sisterly solicitude and feminine ignorance of high
prices planning for his future

Well he replied smiling theyre pretty expensive Im afraid
Caroline

Are they innocently

Yes I think the last sale was at a figure between ninety and one
hundred thousand dollars

Indeed Was fathers seat worth as much as that

Yes

But with a sigh that I suppose went with the rest of the estate

Yes

Into the hands of the man who took it all

Yes the same hands with a sly smile at his own private joke

Then how does it happen that my uncle has it in his possession

The lawyer smiled no more He turned in his chair and gazed quickly and
keenly at the young lady beside him And her gaze was just as keen as
his own

What did you say he asked

I asked you how it happened that my uncle now has fathers Stock
Exchange seat in his possession

Why Has he

Yes And I think you know he has Mr Sylvester I know it because he
told me so himself _Didnt_ you know it

This was a line shot from directly in front and a hard one to dodge
A lie was the only guard and he was not in the habit of lying even
professionally

II cannot answer these questions he declared They involve
professional secrets and

I dont see that this is a secret My uncle has already told me What
I could not understand was how he obtained the seat from the man to whom
it was given as a part of fathers debt Do you know how he obtained
it

Erwellerprobably an arrangement was made I cannot go into
details becausewell for obvious reasons You must excuse me
Caroline

He rose to go

One moment more she said and one more question Mr Sylvester who
_is_ this mysterious personthis stockholder whom father defrauded
this person who wishes his name kept a secret but who does such queer
things Who is he

Caroline I tell you I cannot answer these questions He does wish to
remain unknown as I told you and your brother when we first learned of
him and his claim If I were to tell you I should break my faith with
him You must excuse me you really must

Mr Sylvester perhaps you dont need to tell me Perhaps I can guess
Isnt he my

Caroline I cannot

_Isnt he my uncle Elisha Warren_

Sylvester was half way to the door but she was in his path and looking
him directly in the face He hesitated

I thought so she said You neednt answer Mr Sylvester your face
is answer enough He is

She turned away and walking slowly to the chair from which she had
arisen sank into it

He is she repeated I knew it I wonder that I didnt know it from
the very first How could I have been so blind

The lawyer nervous chagrined and greatly troubled remained standing
by the door He did not know whether to go or stay He took his
handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead

Whew he exclaimed Well by_George_

She paid no attention to him but went on speaking apparently to
herself

It explains everything she said He was fathers brother and
father in some way took and used his money But father knew what sort
of man he was and so he asked him to be our guardian Father thought he
would be kind to us I suppose And he has been kindhe has But why
did he keep it a secret Why did he I dont understand that Of
course the money was his all we had was his by right But to say
nothing  and to let us believe It does not seem like him at all
It

Sylvester interrupted quickly Caroline Caroline he said dont
make any mistake Dont misjudge your uncle again He is a good man one
of the best men I ever knew Yes and one of the wisest Dont say
or think anything for which you may be sorry I am speaking as your
friend

She turned toward him once more the distressed puzzled look still on
her face But I dont understand she cried He Oh Mr
Sylvester please now that I do knownow that you have told me so
muchwont you tell me the rest the reason andall of it Please

The lawyer shook his head regarding her with an expression of annoyance
and reluctant admiration

Now that _Ive_ told you he repeated I dont remember that Ive
told you anything

But you have Not in words perhaps but you have told me I know
Please go on and tell me all If you dont with determination I
shall make Uncle Elisha tell me as soon as he comes I shall

Sylvester sighed Well by George he repeated feelingly Ill tell
you one thing young woman youre wasting your talents You should be
a member of the bar Anyone who can lead a battlescarred veteran of
crossexamination like myself into a trap and then spring it on him as
you have done is gifted by Providence

But will you tell me

He hesitated perplexed and doubtful

I ought not to say another word on the subject he declared
emphatically What Captain Warren will say to me when he finds this
out is unpleasant to consider But But yet I dont know It may
be better for you to learn the real truth than to know a part and
guess wrongly at the rest I What is it you want me to tell you

Everything I want you to sit down here by me and tell me the whole
story from the beginning Please

He hesitated a moment longer and then his mind made up returned to
his chair crossed his legs and began Here it is he said

Caroline about twenty years ago or such matter your father was a
comparatively poor manpoor I mean compared to what he afterward
became But he was a clever man an able business man one who saw
opportunities and grasped them At that time he obtained a grant in
South America for

I know she interrupted the Akrae Rubber Company was formed You
told Steve and me all about that What I want to know is

Wait I did not tell you all about it I said that another man invested
ten thousand dollars with your father to form that company That man so
we now know was your uncle Captain Elisha Warren

I guessed that Of course it must have been he

It was The captain was older than your father had lived carefully
and had saved some money Also at that time he idolized his brother
and believed in his shrewdness and capability He invested this ten
thousand on Rodgers Warrens word that the investment was likely to be a
good one That and to help the latter in business For a few years
the company did nothing during that time your father and uncle
disagreedconcerning another matter quite unconnected with this
oneand they did not see each other again while Rodgers lived In that
long period the Akrae Company made millions But Elisha supposed it
to be bankrupt and worthless becausewell to be frank because his
brother wrote him to that effect

He paused fearful of the effect which this announcement might have upon
the girl But she had guessed this part of her fathers dishonor and was
prepared for it She made no comment and he continued

Now we come to the will Your father Caroline was not a bad man at
heart I knew him well and I believe that may be said truthfully He
realized what he had done how he had defrauded the brother who had been
so kind to him and he meant he kept promising himself to some day
repay the money he had taken To insure that he put that note with the
other papers of the Company If he did repay it could be destroyed If
he did not if he should die it would be there to provewhat it did
prove But always in his mind was the thought of you and Steve the
children he loved He had quarreled with his brother it is true he had
cheated him but restitution for that cheat he had provided But
what would become of you leftin case he died without making
restitutionpenniless He knew his brother as I said knew his
character respected his honesty and believed in his conscientiousness
and his big heart So he made his will and in it as you know he
appointed Elisha your guardian He threw his children and their future
upon the mercy and generosity of the brother he had wronged That is his
reason as we surmise it for making that will

He paused again Caroline did not speak for a moment Then she asked

And no one knewyou or my uncle or anyoneof all this until last
March

No Graves had with his usual care and patience pieced together the
evidence and investigated until we were sure that a stockholder in the
Akrae Company existed and that all of your fathers estate belonged
to him Who that stockholder was we did not know until that day of the
meeting at our office Then Captain Warren told us

But he did not know either

Not until then He supposed his Akrae stock worthless and had
practically forgotten it When we told him of its value of the note
and of the missing shareholder he knew of course

What did he say

Say Caroline he was the most distressed and consciencestricken man
in the city One would have thought he was the wrongdoer and not the
wronged He would have gone straight to you and asked your pardon if we
would have permitted it

But Mr Sylvester now we are coming to the part I cannot understand
Of course the estate belonged to him I know that It is his But why
didnt he tell Steve and me the truth then at once Why did he let us
believe and employ you to lead us to believe that it was not he but
someone else Did he think we would blame him Why has he

Caroline Caroline dont you understand yet Do you imagine for one
moment that your uncle intends keeping that money

She stared at him in utter amazement

Keeping it she repeated Why not It is his It belongs to him

Caroline Im afraid you dont know him even yet He was for going to
you at once and destroying the note in your presence He would have done
it but we persuaded him to wait and think it over for a day or two He
did think and then decided to wait a little longer for your sake

For my sake For mine she passed her hand in a bewildered way across
her forehead Mr Sylvester I dont seem to understand even now I

For your sake Caroline Remember at that time you were engaged to
Malcolm Dunn

Her intent gaze wavered She drew a long breath I see she said
slowly Oh I see

Yes Captain Warren is one of the best judges of character I ever met
The Dunns did not deceive him for one moment He was certain Malcolm
intended marrying you because of your money for that matter so was I
But his was the plan entirely which showed them to you as they were He
knew you were too honest and straightforward to believe such things of
the man to whom you were engaged if they were told you you must see the
proof with your own eyes And he showed it to you

But then she begged distractedly why couldnt he tell me after
that II am so stupid I supposebut Mr Sylvester all this
isis

He might have told you then but he did not think it best Caroline
your uncle has always believed in you Even when you sent him from your
home he did not blame you he said you were deceived that was all
But too he has always declared that you had been as he expressed it
brought up wrong Your money had in a way warped your estimate of
people and things He believed that if you were given the opportunity
you would learn that wealth does not of itself mean happiness So
he decided not to tell you not to give you back your share of your
fathers moneyhe refuses to consider it hisuntil another year until
you were of age at least And there was Steve You know Caroline that
money and what it brought was spoiling Steve He has never been so much
a man as during the past year when he thought himself poor But your
uncle has planned for him as well as for you and when he believes the
time has come he

Please she interrupted falteringly please dont say any more Let
me think Oh please let me think Mr Sylvester You say that Uncle
Elisha intends giving us all that father took from him All of it

Yes all He considers himself merely your guardian still and will
accept only his expenses from the estate

Butbut it is wonderful

Yes it is But I have learned to think him a wonderful man

She shook her head

It is wonderful she repeated brokenly Even though we cannot take
it it is wonderful

What Cannot take it

Of course not Do you suppose that either my brother or I will take the
fortune that our father stoleyes _stole_ from him After he has been
living almost in poverty all these years and we in luxuryon _his_
money Of course we shall not take it

But Caroline I imagine you will have to take it I understand your
feelings but I think he will compel you to take it

I shall _not_ she sprang to her feet Of course I shall not Never
never

Whats that youre never goin to take Caroline Measles or another
trip down in these parts I hope taint the last cause Ive been
callatin youd like it well enough to come again

Caroline turned So did Sylvester Captain Elisha was standing in the
doorway his hand on the knob He was smiling broadly but as he looked
at the two by the fire he ceased to smile

Whats all this he asked suspiciously Caroline whatSylvester
what have you been tellin her

Neither answered at once The captain looked from one to the other

Well whats up he demanded Whats the matter

The lawyer shrugged his shoulders

Whats up he repeated Humph well I should say the jig was up The
murders out The cat is no longer in the bag Thats about the size of
it

Sylvester Caroline had never seen her uncle thoroughly angry before
Sylvester he cried have youHave you dast to tell her what you
shouldnt Didnt you promise me If you told that girl IllIll

His niece stepped forward Hush Uncle Elisha she said He didnt
tell me until I knew already I guessed it Then I asked for the whole
truth and he told me

The whole truth _Caroline_

He wrung his hands

Yes Uncle the whole truth I know you now I thought I knew you
before but I didntnot half I do now

Oh Caroline he stepped toward her and then stopped frantic and
despairing Caroline Caroline he cried again can you ever forgive
me You knowyou must know I aint ever meant to keep it Its all
yours I just didnt give it to you right off because  because
Oh Sylvester tell her I never meant to keep it Tell her

The lawyer shook his head I did tell her he said with another
shrug and she tells me she wont accept it

What the captains eyes were starting from his head What Wont
take it Why its hershers and Steves It always has been Do you
callate Id rob my own brothers children _Dont_ talk so foolish
I wont hear such talk

Caroline was close to tears but she was firm

It isnt ours she said It is yours Our father kept it from you all
these years Do you suppose we will keep it any longer

Captain Elisha looked at her determined face then at the lawyersbut
he found no help there His chin thrust forward He nodded slowly

All right all right he said grimly Sylvester is your shop goin
to be open tomorrer

Guess not Captain was the puzzled reply Its Thanksgiving Why

But Gravesll be to home wont he I could find him at his house

I presume you could

All right then Caroline Warren you listen to me Ill give you till
two oclock to make up your mind to take the money that belongs to you
If you dont I swear to the Lord Amighty Ill take the fust train go
straight to New York hunt up Graves make him go down to the office and
get that note your father made out turnin all his property over to that
Akrae Company Ill get that note and Ill burn it up Then_then_
youll have to take the money because itll be yours Every bit of
evidence thatll hold in law is gone and nobody but you and Stevell
have the shadow of a claim Ill do it so sure as I live There now
you can make up your mind

He turned strode to the door and out of the room A moment later they
heard a scream from Miss Baker in the kitchen Lisha Warren what ails
you Are you crazy There was no answer but the back door closed with
a tremendous bang

     

Half an hour after his dramatic exit Captain Elisha was pacing up and
down the floor of the barn It was an old refuge of his a place where
he was accustomed to go when matters requiring deliberation and thought
oppressed him He was alone Dan had taken the horse to the blacksmiths
to be shod

The captain strode across the floor turned and strode back again Every
few moments he looked at his watch It was a long way to two oclock
but each additional moment was another weight piled upon his soul As
he turned in his stride he saw a shadow move across the sill of the big
open door He caught his breath and stopped

Caroline entered the barn She came straight to him and put her hands
upon the lapels of his coat Her eyes were wet and shining

Caroline he faltered eagerly

You good man she breathed softly Oh you _good_ man

Caroline his voice shook but there was hope in it Caroline youre
goin to take the money

Yes Uncle Elisha Mr Sylvester has shown me that I must He says you
will do something desperate if I refuse

I sartin would And youll take it really

Yes Uncle Elisha

Glory be Andand Caroline you wont hold it against me my makin
you think you was poor and makin you live in that little place and
get along on just so much and all that Can you forgive me for doin
that

Forgive you Can I ever thank you enough I know I cant but I can try
all my life to prove what

Sshh ssh There with a great sigh almost a sob of relief
I guess thisll be a real Thanksgivin after all

But a few minutes later another thought came to him

Caroline he asked I wonder if now that things are as they are
you couldnt do somethin elsesomethin that would please me an
awful lot

What is it Uncle

Its somethin perhaps I aint got any right to ask You mustnt say
yes if you dont want to The other day you told me you cared for Jim
Pearson but that you sent him away cause you thought you had to earn
a livin for you and Steve Now you know that you aint got to do that
And you said you told him if you ever changed your mind youd send for
him Dont you spose you could send for him nowright offso he could
get here for this big Thanksgivin of ours Dont you think you could
Caroline

He looked down into her face and she looked down at the barn floor But
he saw the color creep up over her forehead

Send for himnow she asked in a low tone

Yes Nowright off In time for tomorrow

He could not get here she whispered

Yes he could If you send him a telegram with one word in it
Comeand sign it Carolinehell be here on tomorrow mornins
train or Ill eat my hat and one of Abbies bonnets hove in Think you
could Caroline

A moment then in a whisper Yes Uncle Elisha

Hooray Butbut anxiously hold on Caroline Tell me truly now
You aint doin this just to please me You mustnt do that not for the
world and all You mustnt send for him on my account Only just for one
reasonbecause _you_ want him

He waited for his answer Then she looked up blushing still but with a
smile trembling on her lips

Yes Uncle Elisha she said because _I_ want him

     

The clouds blew away that night and Thanksgiving day dawned clear
and cold The gray sea was now blue the white paint of the houses and
fences glistened in the sun the groves of pitchpine were brilliant
green blotches spread like rugs here and there on the brown hills South
Denboro had thrown off its gloomy raiment and was all dolled up for
Thanksgivin so Captain Elisha said

The captain and Sylvester were leaning on the fence by the gate looking
up the road and waiting for Dan and the twoseater to heave in sight
around the bend The hired man had harnessed early and driven to the
station at least thirty minutes before train time Captain Elisha
was responsible for the early start Steve was coming on that train
possibly someone else was coming The captain did not mean they should
find no welcome or vehicle at the station

The whistle had sounded ten minutes before It was time for Dan to
appear at the bend

I hope to thunder Jim got that telegram observed the captain for the
twentieth time at least since breakfast

So do I replied his friend Theres no reason why he shouldnt is
there

No no sensible one but Ive scared up no less than a couple of
hundred of the other kind If he shouldnt comemy my shed be
disappointed

You wouldnt feel any disappointment yourself of course said the
lawyer with sarcasm

Who Me Oh Id be sorern a scalded wharf rat in a barrel of pepper
But I dont count Theres the real one up there

He motioned with his head toward the window of Carolines room
Sylvester nodded Yes he said I suppose so Captain Im somewhat
surprised that you should be willing to trust that niece of yours
to another man Shes a pretty precious article according to your
estimate

Well aint she accordin to yours

Yes Pretty precious and precious pretty Look at her now

They turned in time to catch a glimpse of the girl as she parted the
curtains and looked out on the road She saw them looking at her
smiled blushed and disappeared Both men smoked in silence for a
moment Then the captain said

Waitin Hi hum nothin like it when youre waitin for _the_ one
is there

No nothing

Yup Well for a pair of old single hulks our age strikes me were
gettin pretty sentimental You say you wonder Id trust Caroline to
another man I wouldnt to the average one But Jim Pearsons all right
Youll say so too when you know him as well as I do

Ill trust your judgment any time So you wont tell Steve yet awhile
that hes not broke

No And Caroline wont tell him either Steves doin fustrate as
he is Hes in the pickle tub and twill do him good to season a
spell longer But I think hes goin to be all right by and by Say
Sylvester this New York cruise of mine turned out pretty good after
all didnt it

Decidedly good It was the making of your niece and nephew Caroline
realizes it now and so will Steve later on

Hope so It didnt do _me_ any harm with a chuckle I wouldnt have
missed that little beat up the bay with Marm Dunn for a good deal For
a spell there we was bows abreast and twas hard to tell whod turn the
mark first Heard from the Dunns lately

No Why yes I did hear that they were in a tighter box than ever
financially The smash will come pretty soon

Im sorry The old ladyll go down with colors nailed to the mast Ill
bet and shell leave a lot of suds where she sank Do you know I never
blamed her so much She was built that way Shes considerble like
old Mrs Patience Blodgett who used to live up here to the Neck like
heronly there never was two people more different Pashy was the
craziest blueribboner you ever saw Her one idea in life was gettin
folks to sign the pledge She married Tim Blodgett who was the wust
soak in the countyhed have figgered out if you analyzed him about
like a bottle of patent medicine seventytwo per cent alcohol Well
Pashy married him to reform him and she made her brags that shed get
him to sign the pledge And she did but only by puttin it in front of
him when he was too drunk to read it

The lawyer laughed heartily So you think Mrs Corcoran Dunn resembles
her do you he observed

In one wayyes Both of em sacrifice everything else to one idea
Pashys was gettin that pledge signed and never mind ways and means
Mrs Dunns is money and positionnever mind how they come See what
Im drivin at

Sylvester laughed again I guess so he said Captain Warren I never
saw you in better spirits Do you know what I think I think that for
a chap who has just given away half of a goodsized fortune and intends
giving away the other half youre the most cheerful specimen I ever
saw

The captain laughed too I am aint I he said Well I can say
truthful what I never expected to say in my lifethat _once_ I was
wuth haf a million dollars As for the rest of it Im like that
millionairethat Hi Look There comes Dan See him

They peered eagerly over the fence The Warren twoseater had rounded
the bend in the road Dan was driving Beside him sat a young fellow who
waved his hand

Steve cried the captain excitedly Theres Steve Andandyes
theres somebody on the back seat Its Jim Hes come Hooray

He was darting out of the gate but his friend seized his coat

Wait he cried I dont want to lose the rest of that sentence You
said you were like some millionaire Who

Dont bother me cried Captain Elisha Who Why I was goin to say
I was like that millionaire chap who passes out a library every time he
wakes up and happens to think of it You know who I mean Ahoy there
Jim Ahoy Steve

He was waving his hand to the passengers in the approaching vehicle

Yes prompted his friend hastily I know who you meanCarnegie

Thats the feller Ive come to feel about the way he says he
doesthat twould be a crime for me to die rich
