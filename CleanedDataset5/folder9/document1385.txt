HOW LIN McLEAN WENT EAST

In the old days the happy days when Wyoming was a Territory with a
future instead of a State with a past and the unfenced cattle grazed
upon her ranges by prosperous thousands young Lin McLean awaked early
one morning in cow camp and lay staring out of his blankets upon the
world He would be twentytwo this week He was the youngest cowpuncher
in camp But because he could break wild horses he was earning more
dollars a month than any man there except one The cook was a more
indispensable person None save the cook was up so far this morning
Lins brother punchers slept about him on the ground some motionless
some shifting their prone heads to burrow deeper from the increasing
day The busy work of spring was over that of the fall or beef
roundup not yet come It was midJuly a lull for these hardriding
bachelors of the saddle and many unspent dollars stood to Mr McLeans
credit on the ranch books

Whats the matter with some variety muttered the boy in his blankets

The long range of the mountains lifted clear in the air They slanted
from the purple folds and furrows of the pines that richly cloaked them
upward into rock and grassy bareness until they broke remotely into
bright peaks and filmed into the distant lavender of the north and the
south On their western side the streams ran into Snake or into Green
River and so at length met the Pacific On this side Wind River flowed
forth from them descending out of the Lake of the Painted Meadows A
mere troutbrook it was up there at the top of the divide with easy
riffles and steppingstones in many places but down here outside
the mountains it was become a streaming avenue a broadening course
impetuous between its two tall green walls of cottonwoodtrees And so
it wound away like a vast green ribbon across the lilacgray sagebrush
and the yellow vanishing plains

Variety you bet young Lin repeated aloud

He unrolled himself from his bed and brought from the garments that
made his pillow a few toilet articles He got on his long boy legs and
limped blithely to the margin In the mornings his slight lameness was
always more visible The camp was at Bull Lake Crossing where the
fork from Bull Lake joins Wind River Here Lin found some convenient
shinglestones with dark deepish water against them where he plunged
his face and energetically washed and came up with the short curly hair
shining upon his round head After enough looks at himself in the dark
water and having knotted a clean jaunty handkerchief at his throat he
returned with his slight limp to camp where they were just sitting at
breakfast to the rear of the cookshelf of the wagon

Bugged up to kill exclaimed one perceiving Lins careful dress

He sure has not shaved again another inquired with concern

I aint got my operaglasses on answered a third

He has spared that pansyblossom mustache said a fourth

My spring crop remarked young Lin rounding on this last one has
juicier prospects than that rateaten catastrophe of last years hay
which wanders out of your face

Why youll soon be talking yourself into a regular man said the
other

But the camp laugh remained on the side of young Lin till breakfast was
ended when the ranch foreman rode into camp

Him Lin McLean at once addressed I was wantin to speak to you said
he

The experienced foreman noticed the boys holiday appearance I
understand youre tired of work he remarked

Who told you asked the bewildered Lin

The foreman touched the boys pretty handkerchief Well I have a way
of taking things in at a glance said he Thats why Im foreman I
expect So youve had enough work

My systems full of it replied Lin grinning As the foreman stood
thinking he added And Id like my time

Time in the cattle idiom meant backpay up to date

Its good were not busy said the foreman

Meanin Id quit all the same inquired Lin rapidly flushing

Nonot meaning any offence Catch up your horse I want to make the
post before it gets hot

The foreman had come down the river from the ranch at Meadow Creek
and the post his goal was Fort Washakie All this part of the country
formed the Shoshone Indian Reservation where by permission pastured
the herds whose owner would pay Lin his time at Washakie So the young
cowpuncher flung on his saddle and mounted

Solong he remarked to the camp by way of farewell He might
never be going to see any of them again but the cowpunchers were not
demonstrative by habit

Going to stop long at Washakie asked one

Alma is not waitergirl at the hotel now another mentioned

If theres a new girl said a third kiss her one for me and tell
her Im handsomer than you

I aint a deceiver of women said Lin

Thats why youll tell her replied his friend

Say Lin why are you quittin us so sudden anyway asked the cook
grieved to lose him

Im after some variety said the boy

If you pick up more than you can use just can a little of it for me
shouted the cook at the departing McLean

This was the last of camp by Bull Lake Crossing and in the foremans
company young Lin now took the road for his accumulated dollars

So youre leaving your bedding and stuff with the outfit said the
foreman

Brought my toothbrush said Lin showing it in the breastpocket of
his flannel shirt

Going to Denver

Why maybe

Take in San Francisco

Sounds slick

Made any plans

Gosh no

Dont want anything on your brain

Nothin except my hat I guess said Lin and broke into cheerful
song

 Twas a nasty baby anyhow
 And it only died to spite us
 Twas afflicted with the cerebrow
 Spinal meningitis

They wound up out of the magic valley of Wind River through the
bastioned gullies and the gnomelike mystery of dry watercourses
upward and up to the level of the huge sagebrush plain above Behind
lay the deep valley they had climbed from mighty expanding its trees
like bushes its cattle like pebbles its opposite side towering also
to the edge of this upper plain There it lay another world One step
farther away from its rim and the two edges of the plain had flowed
together over it like a closing sea covering without a sign or ripple
the great country which lay sunk beneath

A man might think hed dreamed hed saw that place said Lin to the
foreman and wheeled his horse to the edge again Shes sure there
though he added gazing down For a moment his boy face grew
thoughtful Shucks said he then abruptly wheres any joy in
money thats comin till it arrives I have most forgot the feel o
spotcash

He turned his horse away from the farwinding vision of the river and
took a sharp jog after the foreman who had not been waiting for him
Thus they crossed the eighteen miles of high plain and came down to
Fort Washakie in the valley of Little Wind before the day was hot

His roll of wages once jammed in his pocket like an old handkerchief
young Lin precipitated himself out of the posttraders store and away
on his horse up the stream among the Shoshone tepees to an unexpected
entertainmenta wolfdance He had meant to go and see what the new
waitergirl at the hotel looked like but put this off promptly to
attend the dance This hospitality the Shoshone Indians were extending
to some visiting Ute friends and the neighborhood was assembled to
watch the ring of painted naked savages

The posttrader looked after the galloping Lin Whats he quitting his
job for he asked the foreman

Same as most of em quit

Nothing

Nothing

Been satisfactory

Never had a boy more so Goodhearted willing a plumb daredevil with
a horse

And worthless suggested the posttrader

Wellnot yet Hes headed that way

Been punching cattle long

Came in the country about seventyeight I believe and rode for the
Bordeaux Outfit most a year and quit Blew in at Cheyenne till he went
broke and worked over on to the Platte Rode for the C Y Outfit most
a year and quit Blew in at Buffalo Rode for Balaam awhile on Butte
Creek Broke his leg Went to the Drybone Hospital and when the
fracture was commencing to knit pretty good he broke it again at the
hogranch across the bridge Next time youre in Cheyenne get Dr Barker
to tell you about that McLean drifted to Green River last year and went
up over on to Snake and up Snake and was around with a prospecting
outfit on Galena Creek by Pitchstone Canyon Seems he got interested
in some Dutchwoman up there but she had troubledied I think they
saidand he came down by Meteetsee to Wind River Hes liable to go to
Mexico or Africa next

If you need him said the posttrader closing his ledger you can
offer him five more a month

Thatll not hold him

Well let him go Have a cigar The bishop is expected for Sunday and
Ive got to see his room is fixed up for him

The bishop said the foreman Ive heard him highly spoken of

You can hear him preach tomorrow The bishop is a good man

Hes better than that hes a man stated the foremanat least so
they tell me

Now saving an Indian dance scarce any possible event at the Shoshone
agency could assemble in one spot so many sorts of inhabitants as a
visit from this bishop Inhabitants of four colors gathered to view the
wolfdance this afternoonred men white men black men yellow men
Next day three sorts came to church at the agency The Chinese laundry
was absent But because indeed as the foreman said the bishop was
not only a good man but a man Wyoming held him in respect and went
to look at him He stood in the agency church and held the Episcopal
service this Sunday morning for some brightly glittering army officers
and their families some white cavalry and some black infantry the
agency doctor the posttrader his foreman the government scout three
gamblers the waitergirl from the hotel the stagedriver who was
there because she was old Chief Washakie whitehaired and royal in
blankets with two royal Utes splendid beside him one benchful of
squatting Indian children silent and marvelling and on the back
bench the commanding officers new hiredgirl and beside her Lin
McLean

Mr McLeans hours were already various and successful Even at the
wolfdance before he had wearied of its monotonous drumming and
pageant his roving eye had rested upon a girl whose eyes he caught
resting upon him A look an approach a word and each was soon content
with the other Then when her duties called her to the post from him
and the streams border with a promise for next day he sought the hotel
and found the three gamblers anxious to make his acquaintance for when
a cowpuncher has his pay many people will take an interest in him The
three gamblers did not know that Mr McLean could play cards He left
them late in the evening fat with their money and sought the tepees of
the Arapahoes They lived across the road from the Shoshones and among
their tents the boy remained until morning He was here in church now
keeping his promise to see the bishop with the girl of yesterday and
while he gravely looked at the bishop Miss Sabina Stone allowed his arm
to encircle her waist No soldier had achieved this yet but Lin was the
first cowpuncher she had seen and he had given her the handkerchief
from round his neck

The quiet air blew in through the windows and door the pure light
breath from the mountains only passing over their foothills it had
caught and carried the clear aroma of the sagebrush This it brought
into church and with this seemed also to float the peace and great
silence of the plains The little melodeon in the corner played by one
of the ladies at the post had finished accompanying the hymn and now
it prolonged a few closing chords while the bishop paused before his
address resting his keen eyes on the people He was dressed in a
plain suit of black with a narrow black tie This was because the Union
Pacific Railroad while it had delivered him correctly at Green River
had despatched his robes towards Cheyenne

Without citing chapter and verse the bishop began

And he arose and came to his father But when he was yet a great way
off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his
neck and kissed him

The bishop told the story of that surpassing parable and then proceeded
to draw from it a discourse fitted to the drifting destinies in whose
presence he found himself for one solitary morning He spoke unlike many
clergymen His words were chiefly those which the people round him used
and his voice was more like earnest talking than preaching

Miss Sabina Stone felt the arm of her cowpuncher loosen slightly and
she looked at him But he was looking at the bishop no longer gravely
but with wideopen eyes alert When the narrative reached the elder
brother in the field and how he came to the house and heard sounds of
music and dancing Miss Stone drew away from her companion and let him
watch the bishop since he seemed to prefer that She took to reading
hymns vindictively The bishop himself noted the sunbrowned boy face
and the wideopen eyes He was too far away to see anything but the
alert listening position of the young cowpuncher He could not discern
how that after he had left the music and dancing and begun to draw
morals attention faded from those eyes that seemed to watch him and
they filled with dreaminess It was very hot in church Chief Washakie
went to sleep and so did a corporal but Lin McLean sat in the same
alert position till Miss Stone pulled him and asked if he intended to
sit down through the hymn Then church was out Officers Indians and
all the people dispersed through the great sunshine to their dwellings
and the cowpuncher rode beside Sabina in silence

What are you studying over Mr McLean inquired the lady after a
hundred yards

Did you ever taste steamed Duxbury clams asked Lin absently

No indeed Whats them

Oh just clams Yu have drawn butter too Mr McLean fell silent
again

I guess Ill be late for settin the colonels table Goodbye said
Sabina quickly and swished her whip across the pony who scampered
away with her along the straight road across the plain to the post

Lin caught up with her at once and made his peace

Only protested Sabina I aint used to gentlemen taking me out
andwell same as if I was a colliedog Maybe its Wind River
politeness

But she went riding with him up Trout Creek in the cool of the
afternoon Out of the Indian tepees scattered wide among the flat
levels of sagebrush smoke rose thin and gentle and vanished They
splashed across the many little running channels which lead water
through that thirsty soil and though the range of mountains came no
nearer behind them the post with its white flat buildings and green
trees dwindled to a toy village

My but its far to everywheres here exclaimed Sabina and its
little youre sayin for yourself today Mr McLean Ill have to do
the talking Whats that thing now where the rocks are

Thats Little Wind River Canyon said the young man Feel like goin
there Miss Stone

Why yes It looks real nice and shady like dont it Lets

So Miss Stone turned her pony in that direction

When do your folks eat supper inquired Lin

Halfpast six Oh weve lots of time Come on

How many miles per hour do you figure that cayuse of yourn can travel
Lin asked

What are you atalking about anyway Youre that strange today said
the lady

Only if we try to make that canyon I guess youll be late settin the
colonels table Lin remarked his hazel eyes smiling upon her That
is if your horse aint good for twenty miles an hour Mine aint I
know But Ill do my best to stay with yu

Youre the teasingest man said Miss Stone pouting I might have
knowed it was ever so much further nor it looked

Well I aint sayin I dont want to go if yu was desirous of campin
out tonight

Mr McLean Indeed and Id do no such thing and Sabina giggled

A sagehen rose under their horses feet and hurtled away heavily over
the next rise of ground taking a final wide sail out of sight

Something like them partridges used to said Lin musingly

Partridges inquired Sabina

Used to be in the woods between Lynn and Salem Maybe the woods are
gone by this time Yes they must be gone I guess

Presently they dismounted and sought the stream bank

We had music and dancing at Thanksgiving and such times said Lin his
wiry length stretched on the grass beside the seated Sabina He was not
looking at her but she took a pleasure in watching him his curly head
and bronze face against which the young mustache showed to its full
advantage

I expect you used to dance a lot remarked Sabina for a subject

Yes Do yu know the Portland Fancy

Sabina did not and her subject died away

Did anybody ever tell you you had good eyes she inquired next

Why sure said Lin waking for a moment but I like your color best
A girls eyes will mostly beat a mans

Indeed I dont think so exclaimed poor Sabina too much expectant
to perceive the fatal note of routine with which her transient admirer
pronounced this gallantry He informed her that hers were like the sea
and she told him she had not yet looked upon the sea

Never said he Its a turruble pity youve never saw salt water
Its different from fresh All around home its blueawful blue in
Julyaround Swampscott and Marblehead and Nahant and around the
islands Ive swam there lots Then our home bruck up and we went to
board in Boston He snapped off a flower in reach of his long arm
Suddenly all dreaminess left him

I wonder if youll be settin the colonels table when I come back he
said

Miss Stone was at a loss

Im goin East tomorrowEast to Boston

Yesterday he had told her that sixteen miles to Lander was the farthest
journey from the post that he intended to makethe farthest from the
post and her

I hope nothing aint happened to your folks said she

I aint got no folks replied Lin barring a brother I expect he is
taking good care of himself

Dont you correspond

Well I guess he would if there was anything to say There aint been
nothin

Sabina thought they must have quarrelled but learned that they had not
It was time for her now to return and set the colonels table so Lin
rose and went to bring her horse When he had put her in her saddle she
noticed him step to his own

Why I didnt know you were lame cried she

Shucks said Lin It dont cramp my style any He had sprung on
his horse ridden beside her leaned and kissed her before she got any
measure of his activity

Thats how said he and they took their homeward way galloping No
Lin continued Frank and me never quarrelled I just thought Id have
a look at this Western country Frank he thought drygoods was good
enough for him and so were both satisfied I expect And thats a lot
of years now Whoop ye he suddenly sang out and fired his sixshooter
at a jackrabbit who strung himself out flat and flew over the earth

Both dismounted at the paradeground gate and he kissed her again when
she was not looking upon which she very properly slapped him and he
took the horses to the stable He sat down to tea at the hotel and
found the meal consisted of black potatoes gray tea and a guttering
dish of fat pork But his appetite was good and he remarked to himself
that inside the first hour he was in Boston he would have steamed
Duxbury clams Of Sabina he never thought again and it is likely that
she found others to take his place Fort Washakie was one hundred and
fifty miles from the railway and men there were many and girls were
few

The next morning the other passengers entered the stage with
resignation knowing the thirtysix hours of evil that lay before them
Lin climbed up beside the driver He had a new trunk now

Dont get full Lin said the clerk putting the mailsacks in at the
store

My plans aint settled that far yet replied Mr McLean

Leave it out of them said the voice of the bishop laughing inside
the stage

It was a cool fine air Gazing over the huge plain down in which lies
Fort Washakie Lin heard the faint notes of the trumpet on the parade
ground and took a goodbye look at all things He watched the American
flag grow small saw the circle of steam rising away down by the hot
springs looked at the bad lands beyond chemically pink and rose amid
the vast natural quietcolored plain Across the spreading distance
Indians trotted at wide spaces generally two large bucks on one small
pony or a squaw and pappoosea bundle of particolored rags Presiding
over the whole rose the mountains to the west serene lifting into the
clearest light Then once again came the now tiny music of the trumpet

When do yu figure on comin back inquired the driver

Oh Ill just look around back there for a spell said Lin About a
month I guess

He had seven hundred dollars At Lander the horses are changed and
during this operation Lins friends gathered and said where was any
sense in going to Boston when you could have a good time where you
were But Lin remained sitting safe on the stage Toward evening at the
bottom of a little dry gulch some eight feet deep the horses decided
it was a suitable place to stay It was the bishop who persuaded them
to change their minds He told the driver to give up beating and
unharness Then they were led up the bank quivering and a broken trace
was spliced with rope Then the stage was forced on to the level ground
the bishop proving a strong man familiar with the gear of vehicles
They crossed through the pass among the quaking asps and the pines
and reaching Pacific Springs came down again into open country That
afternoon the stage put its passengers down on the railroad platform
at Green River this was the route in those days before the midwinter
catastrophes of frozen passengers led to its abandonment The bishop was
going west His robes had passed him on the up stage during the night
When the reverend gentleman heard this he was silent for a very short
moment and then laughed vigorously in the baggageroom

I can understand how you swear sometimes he said to Lin McLean but
I cant you see Not even at this

The cowpuncher was checking his own trunk to Omaha

Goodbye and good luck to you continued the bishop giving his hand
to Lin And look heredont you think you might leave that getting
full out of your plans

Lin gave a slightly shamefaced grin I dont guess I can sir he
said Im givin yu straight goods yu see he added

Thats right But you look like a man who could stop when hed had
enough Try that Youre man enoughand come and see me whenever were
in the same place

He went to the hotel There were several hours for Lin to wait He
walked up and down the platform till the stars came out and the bright
lights of the town shone in the saloon windows Over across the way
pianomusic sounded through one of the many open doors

Wonder if the professors there yet said Lin and he went across the
railroad tracks The bartender nodded to him as he passed through into
the back room In that place were many tables and the flat clicking and
rattle of ivory counters sounded pleasantly through the music Lin
did not join the studpoker game He stood over a table at which sat a
dealer and a player very silent opposite each other and whereon were
painted sundry cards numerals and the colors red and black in squares
The legend Jacks pay was also clearly painted The player placed chips
on whichever insignia of fortune he chose and the dealer slid cards
quite fairly from the top of a pack that lay held within a skeleton
case made with some clamped bands of tin Sometimes the players pile of
chips rose high and sometimes his sumptuous pillar of gold pieces was
lessened by one It was very interesting and pretty to see Lin had
much better have joined the game of studpoker Presently the eye of
the dealer met the eye of the player After that slight incident the
players chip pile began to rise and rose steadily till the dealer
made admiring comments on such a run of luck Then the player stopped
cashed in and said goodnight having nearly doubled the number of his
gold pieces

Five dollars worth said Lin sitting down in the vacant seat The
chips were counted out to him He played with unimportant shiftings
of fortune until a short while before his train was due and then
singularly enough he discovered he was one hundred and fifty dollars
behind the game

I guess Ill leave the train go without me said Lin buying five
dollars worth more of ivory counters So that train came and went
removing eastward Mr McLeans trunk

During the hour that followed his voice grew dogged and his remarks
briefer as he continually purchased more chips from the now surprised
and sympathetic dealer It was really wonderful how steadily Lin
lostjust as steadily as his predecessor had won after that meeting of
eyes early in the evening

When Lin was three hundred dollars out his voice began to clear of its
huskiness and a slight humor revolved and sparkled in his eye When his
seven hundred dollars had gone to safer hands and he had nothing left at
all but some silver fractions of a dollar his robust cheerfulness was
all back again He walked out and stood among the railroad tracks with
his hands in his pockets and laughed at himself in the dark Then his
fingers came on the check for Omaha and he laughed loudly The trunk by
this hour must be nearing Rawlins it was going east anyhow

Im following it you bet he declared kicking the rail Not yet
though Nor Ill not go to Washakie to have em josh me And yonder lays
Boston He stretched his arm and pointed eastward Had he seen another
man going on in this fashion alone in the dark among sidetracked
freight cars he would have pitied the poor fool And I guess Bostonll
have to get along without me for a spell too continued Lin A man
dont want to show up plumb broke like that younger son did after eatin
with the hogs the bishop told about His father was a Jimdandy that
hog chaps Hustled around and set em up when he come back home Frank
hed say to me How do you do brother and hed be wearin a good suit
o clothes andno sir you bet

Lin now watched the great headlight of a freight train bearing slowly
down into Green River from the wilderness Green River is the end of a
division an epoch in every trains journey Lanterns swung signals
the great dim thing slowed to its standstill by the coal chute its
locomotive moved away for a turn of repose the successor backed
steaming to its place to tackle a nights work Cars were shifted
heavily bumping and parting

Hello Lin A face was looking from the window of the caboose

Hello responded Mr McLean perceiving above his head Honey Wiggin a
good friend of his They had not met for three years

They claimed you got killed somewheres I was sorry to hear it Honey
offered his condolence quite sincerely

Bruck my leg corrected Lin if thats what they meant

I expect thats it said Honey Youve had no other trouble

Been boomin said Lin

From the mere undertone in their voices it was plain they were good
friends carefully hiding their pleasure at meeting

Wherre yu bound inquired Honey

East said Lin

Better jump in here then Were goin west

That just suits me said Lin

The busy lanterns wagged among the switches the steady lights of the
saloons shone along the towns wooden facade From the bluffs that
wall Green River the sweet clean sagebrush wind blew down in currents
freshly through the coalsmoke A wrench passed through the train from
locomotive to caboose each fettered car in turn strained into motion
and slowly rolled over the bridge and into silence from the steam and
the bells of the railroad yard Through the open windows of the caboose
great dullred cinders rattled in and the whistles of distant Union
Pacific locomotives sounded over the open plains ominous and long like
ships at sea

Honey and Lin sat for a while making few observations and far between
as their way is between whom flows a stream of oldtime understanding
Mutual whiskey and silence can express much friendship and eloquently

What are yu doing at present Lin inquired

Prospectin

Now prospecting means hunting gold except to such spirits as the boy
Lin To these it means finding gold So Lin McLean listened to the talk
of his friend Honey Wiggin as the caboose trundled through the night He
saw himself in a vision of the near future enter a bank and thump down
a bag of golddust Then he saw the new clean money the man would hand
him in exchange bills with round zeroes half covered by being folded
over and heavy satisfactory gold pieces And then he saw the blue
water that twinkles beneath Boston His fingers came again on his trunk
check He had his ticket too And as dawn now revealed the gray country
to him his eye fell casually upon a milepost Omaha 876 He began
to watch for them877 878 But the trunk would really get to Omaha

What are yu laughin about asked Honey

Oh the wheels

Wheels

Dont yu hear em said Lin Variety they keep asayin
Variety variety

Huh said Honey with scorn Kerchunkachunk s all I make it

Youre no poet observed Mr McLean

As the train moved into Evanston in the sunlight a gleam of dismay shot
over Lins face and he ducked his head out of sight of the window but
immediately raised it again Then he leaned out waving his arm with a
certain defiant vigor But the bishop on the platform failed to notice
this performance though it was done for his sole benefit nor would Lin
explain to the inquisitive Wiggin what the matter was Therefore very
naturally Honey drew a conclusion for himself looked quickly out of
the window and being disappointed in what he expected to see remarked
sulkily Do yu figure I care what sort of a lookin girl is stuck on
yu in Evanston And upon this young Lin laughed so loudly that his
friend told him he had never seen a man get so foolish in three years

Byandby they were in Utah and in the company of Ogden friends
forgot prospecting Later they resumed freight trains and journeyed
north In Idaho they said goodbye to the train hands in the caboose
and came to Little Camas and so among the mountains near Feather Creek
Here the berries were of several sorts and growing riper each day and
the bears in the timber above knew this and came down punctually
with the season making variety in the otherwise even life of the
prospectors It was now August and Lin sat on a wet hill making
mudpies for sixty days But the philosophers stone was not in the wash
at that placer nor did Lin gather golddust sufficient to cover the
nail of his thumb Then they heard of an excitement at Obo Nevada and
hurrying to Obo they made some more mudpies

Now and then eating their fat bacon at noon Honey would say Lin
wherre yu goin

And Lin always replied East This became a signal for drinks

For beauty and promise Nevada is a name among names Nevada Pronounce
the word aloud Does it not evoke mountains and clear air heights
of untrodden snow and valleys aromatic with the pine and musical with
falling waters Nevada But the name is all Abomination of desolation
presides over ninetenths of the place The sun beats down as on a roof
of zinc fierce and dull Not a drop of water to a mile of sand The
mean ashdump landscape stretches on from nowhere to nowhere a spot
of mange No portion of the earth is more lacquered with paltry
unimportant ugliness

There is gold in Nevada but Lin and Honey did not find it Prospecting
of the sort they did besides proving unfruitful is not comfortable
Now and again losing patience Lin would leave his work and stalk about
and gaze down at the scattered men who stooped or knelt in the water
Passing each busy prospector Lin would read on every broad upturned
pair of overalls the same label Levi Strauss No 2 with a picture
of two lusty horses hitched to one of these garments and vainly
struggling to split them asunder Lin remembered he was wearing a label
just like that too and when he considered all things he laughed to
himself Then having stretched the ache out of his long legs he would
return to his ditch As autumn wore on his feet grew cold in the mushy
gravel they were sunk in He beat off the sand that had stiffened on his
boots and hated Obo Nevada But he held himself ready to say East
whenever he saw Honey coming along with the bottle The cold weather
put an end to this adventure The ditches froze and filled with snow
through which the sordid gravel heaps showed in a dreary fashion so the
two friends drifted southward

Near the small new town of Mesa Arizona they sat down again in the
dirt It was milder here and when the sun shone never quite froze
But this part of Arizona is scarcely more grateful to the eye than
Nevada Moreover Lin and Honey found no gold at all Some men near them
found a little Then in January even though the sun shone it quite
froze one day

Were seein the country anyway said Honey

Seein hell said Lin and theres more of it above ground than I
thought

Whatll we do Honey inquired

Have to walk for a joba goodpayin job responded the hopeful
cowpuncher And he and Honey went to town

Lin found a job in twentyfive minutes becoming assistant to the
apothecary in Mesa Established at the drugstore he made up the
simpler prescriptions He had studied practical pharmacy in
Boston between the ages of thirteen and fifteen and besides this
qualification the apothecary had seen him when he first came into Mesa
and liked him Lin made no mistakes that he or any one ever knew of
and as the mild weather began he materially increased the apothecarys
business by persuading him to send East for a sodawater fountain The
ladies of the town clustered around this entertaining novelty and while
sipping vanilla and lemon bought knickknacks And the gentlemen of
the town discovered that whiskey with soda and strawberry syrup was
delicious and produced just as competent effects A group of them were
generally standing in the shop and shaking dice to decide who should
pay for the next while Lin administered to each glass the necessary
ingredients Thus money began to come to him a little more steadily than
had been its wont and he divided with the penniless Honey

But Honey found fortune quickly too Through excellent cardplaying he
won a pinto from a small Mexican horsethief who came into town from the
South and who cried bitterly when he delivered up his pet pony to the
new owner The new owner being a man of the world and agile on his
feet was only slightly stabbed that evening as he walked to the
dancehall at the edge of the town The Mexican was buried on the next
day but one

The pony stood thirteen two and was as long as a steamboat He had
white eyelashes pink nostrils and one eye was bright blue If you
spoke pleasantly to him he rose instantly on his hindlegs and tried
to beat your face He did not look as if he could run and that was what
made him so valuable Honey travelled through the country with him and
every gentleman who saw the pinto and heard Honey became anxious to get
up a race Lin always sent money for Wiggin to place and he soon
opened a bank account while Honey besides his racingbridle bought a
silverinlaid one a pair of fortydollar spurs and a beautiful saddle
richly stamped Every day when in Mesa Honey would step into the
drugstore and inquire Lin wherre yu goin

But Lin never answered any more He merely came to the sodawater
fountain with the whiskey The passing of days brought a choked season
of fine sand and hard blazing sky Heat rose up from the ground and hung
heavily over man and beast Many insects sat out in the sun rattling
with joy the little tearing river grew clear from the swollen mud and
shrank to a succession of standing pools and the fat squatting cactus
bloomed everywhere into buttercolored flowers big as tulips in the
sand There were artesian wells in Mesa and the water did not taste
very good but if you drank from the standing pools where the river
had been you repaired to the drugstore almost immediately A troop of
wandering players came dotting along the railroad and reaching Mesa
played a brassband up and down the street and announced the powerful
drama of East Lynne Then Mr McLean thought of the Lynn marshes that
lie between there and Chelsea and of the sea that must look so cool
He forgot them while following the painful fortunes of the Lady Isabel
but going to bed in the back part of the drugstore he remembered how
he used to beat everybody swimming in the salt water

Im goin he said Then he got up and striking the light he
inspected his bank account Im sure goin he repeated blowing the
light out and I can buy the fatted calf myself you bet for he had
often thought of the bishops story You bet he remarked once more in
a muffled voice and was asleep in a minute The apothecary was sorry to
have him go and Honey was deeply grieved

Id pull out with yer he said only I can do business round Yuma and
westward with the pinto

For three farewell days Lin and Honey roved together in all sorts of
places where they were welcome and once more Lin rode a horse and
was in his native element Then he travelled to Deming and so through
Denver to Omaha where he was told that his trunk had been sold for
some months Besides a suit of clothes for town wear it had contained a
buffalo coat for his brothersomething scarce to see in these days

Frankll have to get along without it he observed philosophically
and took the next eastbound train

If you journey in a Pullman from Mesa to Omaha without a waistcoat and
with a silk handkerchief knotted over the collar of your flannel shirt
instead of a tie wearing besides tall highheeled boots a soft
gray hat with a splendid brim a few people will notice you but not
the majority New Mexico and Colorado are used to these things As Iowa
with its immense rolling grain encompasses you people will stare a
little more for youre getting near the East where cowpunchers are
not understood But in those days the line of cleavage came sharpdrawn
at Chicago West of there was still tolerably west but east of
there was east indeed and the Atlantic Ocean was the next important
stoppingplace In Lins new train good gloves patentleathers and
silence prevailed throughout the sleepingcar which was for Boston
without change Had not home memories begun impetuously to flood
his mind he would have felt himself conspicuous Town clothes and
conventions had their due value with him But just now the boys
singlehearted thoughts were far from any surroundings and he was
murmuring to himself Tomorrow tomorrow night

There were ladies in that blue plush car for Boston who looked at Lin
for thirty miles at a stretch and by the time Albany was reached
the next day one or two of them commented that he was the most
attractivelooking man they had ever seen Whereas beyond his tallness
and wideopen jocular eyes eyes that seemed those of a not highly
conscientious wild animal there was nothing remarkable about young
Lin except stage effect The conductor had been annoyed to have such
a passenger but the cowpuncher troubled no one and was extremely
silent So evidently was he a piece of the true frontier that curious
and hopeful fellowpassengers after watching him with diversion more
than once took a seat next to him He met their chatty inquiries with
monosyllables so few and so unprofitable in their quiet politeness that
the passengers soon gave him up At Springfield he sent a telegram to
his brother at the great drygoods establishment that employed him

The train began its homestretch after Worcester and whirled and swung
by hills and ponds he began to watch for and through stations with old
wayside names These flashed on Lins eye as he sat with his hat off
and his forehead against the window looking Wellesley Then not long
after Riverside That was the Charles River and did the picnic woods
used to be above the bridge or below West Newton Newtonville Newton
Faneuils next he said aloud in the car as the longforgotten
homeknowledge shone forth in his recollection The traveller seated
near said Beg pardon but turning wondered at the allunconscious
Lin with his forehead pressed against the glass The blue water flashed
into sight and soon after they were running in the darkness between
high walls but the cowpuncher never moved though nothing could be
seen When the porter announced Boston he started up and followed
like a sheep in the general exodus Down on the platform he moved along
with the slow crowd till some one touched him and wheeling round he
seized both his brothers hands and swore a good oath of joy

There they stoodthe long brown fellow with the silk handkerchief
knotted over his flannel shirt greeting tremendously the spruce
civilian who had a ropecolored mustache and bore a fainthearted
resemblance to him The story was plain on its face to the passersby
and one of the ladies who had come in the car with Lin turned twice and
smiled gently to herself

But Frank McLeans heart did not warm He felt that what he had been
afraid of was true and he saw he was being made conspicuous He saw men
and women stare in the station and he saw them staring as he and his
Western brother went through the streets Lin strode along sniffing the
air of Boston looking at all things and making it a stretch for his
sleek companion to keep step with him Frank thought of the refined
friends he should have to introduce his brother to for he had
risen with his salary and now belonged to a small club where the
payingtellers of banks played cards every night and the head clerk at
the Parker House was president Perhaps he should not have to reveal
the cowpuncher to these shining ones Perhaps the cowpuncher would
not stay very long Of course he was glad to see him again and he would
take him to dine at some obscure place this first evening But this was
not Lins plan Frank must dine with him at the Parker House Frank
demurred saying it was he that should be host

And he added they charge up high for wines at Parkers Then for
the twentieth time he shifted a sidelong eye over his brothers clothes

Youre goin to take your grub with me said Lin Thats all right I
guess And there aint any no about it Things is not the same like
as if father was livinhis voice softenedand here to see me come
home Now Im good for several dinners with wines charged up high I
expect nor it aint nobody in this world barrin just Lin McLean that
Ive any need to ask for anything Mr McLean says I to Lin can
yu spare me some cash Why to be sure you bet And well start off
with steamed Duxbury clams The cowpuncher slapped his pocket where
the coin made a muffled chinking Then he said gruffly I suppose
Swampscotts there yet

Yes said Frank Its a dead little town is Swampscott

I guess Ill take a look at the old house tomorrow Lin pursued

Oh thats been pulled down sinceI forget the year they improved that
block

Lin regarded in silence his brother who was speaking so jauntily of the
first and last home they had ever had

Seventynine is when it was continued Frank So you can save the
trouble of travelling away down to Swampscott

I guess Ill go to the graveyard anyway said the cowpuncher in his
offish voice and looking fixedly in front of him

They came into Washington Street and again the elder McLean uneasily
surveyed the youngers appearance

But the momentary chill had melted from the heart of the genial Lin
After tomorrow said he laying a hand on his brothers shoulder
yu can start any lead yu please and I guess I can stay with yu
pretty close Frank

Frank said nothing He saw one of the members of his club on the other
side of the way and the member saw him and Frank caught diverted
amazement on the members face Lins hand weighed on his shoulder and
the stress became too great Lin said he while youre running with
our crowd you dont want to wear that style of hat you know

It may be that such words can in some way be spoken at such a time but
not in the way that these were said The frozen fact was irrevocably
revealed in the tone of Franks voice

The cowpuncher stopped dead short and his hand slid off his brothers
shoulder Youve made it plain he said evenly slanting his steady
eyes down into Franks Youve explained yourself fairly well Run
along with your crowd and Ill not bother yu more with comin round
and causin yu to feel ashamed Its a heap better to understand these
things at once and save making a fool of yourself any longer n yu
need to I guess there aint no more to be said only one thing If yu
see me around on the street dont yu try any talk for Id be liable
to close your jaw up and maybe yud have more of a job explainin that
to your crowd than youve had makin me see what kind of a man Ive got
for a brother

Frank found himself standing alone before any reply to these sentences
had occurred to him He walked slowly to his club where a friend joked
him on his glumness

Lin made a sore failure of amusing himself that night and in the
bright hot morning he got into the train for Swampscott At the
graveyard he saw a woman lay a bunch of flowers on a mound and kneel
weeping

There aint nobody to do that for this one thought the cowpuncher
and looked down at the grave he had come to see then absently gazed at
the woman

She had stolen away from her daily life to come here where her grief
was shrined and now her heart found it hard to bid the lonely place
goodbye So she lingered long her thoughts sunk deep in the motionless
past When she at last looked up she saw the tall strange man reenter
from the street among the tombs and deposit on one of them an ungainly
lump of flowers They were what Lin had been able hastily to buy in
Swampscott He spread them gently as he had noticed the woman do but
her act of kneeling he did not imitate He went away quickly For some
hours he hung about the little town aimlessly loitering watching the
salt water where he used to swim

Yu dont belong any more Lin he miserably said at length and took
his way to Boston

The next morning determined to see the sights he was in New York and
drifted about to all places night and day till his money was mostly
gone and nothing to show for it but a somewhat pleasurebeaten face and
a deep hatred of the crowded scrambling East So he suddenly bought a
ticket for Green River Wyoming and escaped from the city that seemed
to numb his good humor

When after three days the Missouri lay behind him and his holiday he
stretched his legs and took heart to see out of the window the signs
of approaching desolation And when on the fourth day civilization
was utterly emptied out of the world he saw a bunch of cattle and
galloping among them his spurred and booted kindred And his manner
took on that alertness a horse shows on turning into the home road As
the stage took him toward Washakie old friends turned up every fifty
miles or so shambling out of a cabin or a stable and saying in casual
tones Hello Lin whereve you been at

At Lander there got into the stage another old acquaintance the Bishop
of Wyoming He knew Lin at once and held out his hand and his greeting
was hearty

It took a week for my robes to catch up with me he said laughing
Then in a little while How was the East

Firstrate said Lin not looking at him He was shy of the
conversations taking a moral turn But the bishop had no intention of
revertingat any rate just nowto their last talk at Green River and
the advice he had then given

I trust your friends were all well he said

I guess they was healthy enough said Lin

I suppose you found Boston much changed Its a beautiful city

Good enough town for them that likes it I expect Lin replied

The bishop was forming a notion of what the matter must be but he had
no notion whatever of what now revealed itself

Mr Bishop the cowpuncher said how was that about that fellow you
told about thats in the Bible somewhereshe come home to his folks
and theywell there was his father saw him cominHe stopped
embarrassed

Then the bishop remembered the wideopen eyes and how he had noticed
them in the church at the agency intently watching him And just
now what were best to say he did not know He looked at the young man
gravely

Have yu got a Bible pursued Lin For excuse me but Id like yu
to read that onced

So the bishop read and Lin listened And all the while this good
clergyman was perplexed how to speakor if indeed to speak at this time
at allto the heart of the man beside him for whom the parable had gone
so sorely wrong When the reading was done Lin had not taken his eyes
from the bishops face

How long has that there been wrote he asked

He was told about how long

Mr Bishop said Lin I aint got good knowledge of the Bible and I
never figured it to be a book much on to facts And I tell you Im more
plumb beat about its having that elder brother and him being angry
down in black and white two thousand years ago thanthan if Id seen
a man turn water into wine for Id have knowed that aint so But the
elder brother is factsdeadsure facts And they knowed about that and
put it down just the same as life two thousand years ago

Well said the bishop wisely ignoring the challenge as to miracles
I am a good twenty years older than you and all that time Ive been
finding more facts in the Bible every day I have lived

Lin meditated I guess that could be he said Yes after that yuve
been areadin and what I know for myself that I didnt know till
lately I guess that could be

Then the bishop talked with exceeding care nor did he ask uncomfortable
things or moralize visibly Thus he came to hear how it had fared with
Lin his friend and Lin forgot altogether about its being a parson he
was delivering the fulness of his heart to And come to think he
concluded it werent home I had went to back East layin round them
big cities where a man cant help but feel strange all the week No
sir Yu can blow in a thousand dollars like I did in New York and
itll not give yu any more home feelin than what cattle has put in
a stockyard Nor it wouldnt have in Boston neither Now this country
here he waved his hand towards the endless sagebrush seein it
onced more I know where my home is and I wouldnt live nowheres else
Only I aint got no father watching for me to come up Wind River

The cowpuncher stated this merely as a fact and without any note of
selfpity But the bishops face grew very tender and he looked away
from Lin Knowing his manfor had he not seen many of this kind in his
desert diocesehe forbore to make any text from that last sentence the
cowpuncher had spoken Lin talked cheerfully on about what he should
now do The roundup must be somewhere near Du Noir Creek He would
join it this season but next he should work over to the Powder River
country More business was over there and better chances for a man to
take up some land and have a ranch of his own As they got out at Fort
Washakie the bishop handed him a small book in which he had turned
several leaves down carefully avoiding any page that related of
miracles

You need not read it through you know he said smiling just
read where I have marked and see if you dont find some more facts
Goodbyeand always come and see me

The next morning he watched Lin riding slowly out of the post towards
Wind River leading a single packhorse Byandby the little moving
dot went over the ridge And as the bishop walked back into the
paradeground thinking over the possibilities in that untrained manly
soul he shook his head sorrowfully




THE WINNING OF THE BISCUITSHOOTER

It was quite clear to me that Mr McLean could not know the news
Meeting him today had been unforeseenunforeseen and so pleasant that
the thing had never come into my head until just now after both of us
had talked and dined our fill and were torpid with satisfaction

I had found Lin here at Riverside in the morning At my horses
approach to the cabin it was he and not the postmaster who had come
precipitately out of the door

Im turruble pleased to see yu he had said immediately

Whats happened said I in some concern at his appearance

And he piteously explained Why Ive been here all alone since
yesterday

This was indeed all and my hasty impressions of shooting and a corpse
gave way to mirth over the child and his innocent grievance that he had
blurted out before I could get off my horse

Since when I inquired of him had his own company become such a shock
to him

As to that replied Mr McLean a thought ruffled when a man expects
lonesomeness he stands it like he stands anything else of course
But when he has figured on finding companysay he broke off and
vindictiveness sparkled in his eyewhen youre lucky enough to
catch yourself alone why I suppose yu just take a chair and chat to
yourself for hoursYouve not seen anything of Tommy he pursued with
interest

I had not and forthwith Lin poured out to me the pentup complaints and
sociability with which he was bursting The foreman had sent him over
here with a sackful of letters for the post and to bring back the
weeks mail for the ranch A day was gone now and nothing for a man
to do but sit and sit Tommy was overdue fifteen hours Well you could
have endured that but the neighbors had all locked their cabins and
gone to Buffalo It was circus week in Buffalo Had I ever considered
the money there must be in the circus business Tommy had taken the
outgoing letters early yesterday Nobody had kept him waiting By all
rules he should have been back again last night Maybe the stage was
late reaching Powder River and Tommy had had to lay over for it
Well that would justify him Far more likely he had gone to the circus
himself and taken the mail with him Tommy was no type of man for
postmaster Except drawing the allowance his mother in the East gave
him first of every month he had never shown punctuality that Lin could
remember Never had any second thoughts and awful few first ones Told
bigger lies than a small man ought also

Has successes though said I wickedly

Huh went on Mr McLean Successes One icecreamsoda success And
sheLins still wounded male pride made him plaintivewhy even that
girl quit him once she got the chance to appreciate how insignificant
he was as compared with the size of his words No sir Not one of em
retains interest in Tommy

Lin was unsaddling and looking after my horse just because he was
glad to see me Since our first acquaintance that memorable summer of
Pitchstone Canyon when he had taken such good care of me and such bad
care of himself I had learned pretty well about horses and camp craft
in general He was an entire boy then But he had been East since East
by a route of his own discoveringand from his account of that journey
it had proved I think a sort of spiritual experience And then the
years of our friendship were beginning to roll up Manhood of the
body he had always richly possessed and now whenever we met after a
seasons absence and spoke those invariable words which all old friends
upon this earth use to each other at meetingYou havent changed you
havent changed at allI would wonder if manhood had arrived in Lins
boy soul And so today while he attended to my horse and explained the
nature of Tommy a subject he dearly loved just now I looked at him
and took an intimate superior pride in feeling how much more mature I
was than he after all

Theres nothing like a sense of merit for making one feel aggrieved
and on our return to the cabin Mr McLean pointed with disgust to some
firewood

Look at those sorrowful toothpicks said he Tommys work

So Lin the excellent hearted had angrily busied himself and chopped a
pile of real logs that would last a week He had also cleaned the stove
and nailed up the bed the pillowend of which was on the floor It
appeared the master of the house had been sleeping in it the reverse
way on account of the slant Thus had Lin cooked and dined alone supped
alone and sat over some old newspapers until bedtime alone with his
sense of virtue And now here it was long after breakfast and no Tommy
yet

Its good yu come this forenoon Lin said to me Id not have had
the heart to get up another dinner just for myself Lets eat rich

Accordingly we had richly eaten Lin and I He had gone out among the
sheds and caught some eggs that is how he spoke of it we had opened
a number of things in cans and I had made my famous dish of evaporated
apricots in which I managed to fling a suspicion of caramel throughout
the stew

Tommyll be hot about these said Lin joyfully as we ate the eggs
He dont mind what yu use of his canned goodspickled salmon and
truck He is hospitable all right enough till it comes to an egg Then
hell tell any lie But shucks Yu can read Tommy right through his
clothing Make yourself at home Lin says he yesterday And he
showed me his fresh milk and his stuff Heres a new ham says he
too bad my damned hens aint been layin The sonsoguns have quit on
me ever since Christmas And away he goes to Powder River for the mail
You swore too heavy about them hens thinks I Well I expect he may
have travelled half a mile by the time Id found four nests

I am fond of eggs and eat them constantlyand in Wyoming they were
always a luxury But I never forget those that day and how Lin and
I enjoyed them thinking of Tommy Perhaps manhood was not quite
established in my own soul at that timeand perhaps that is the reason
why it is the only time I have ever known which I would live over again
those years when people said You are old enough to know betterand
one didnt care

Salmon apricots eggs we dealt with them all properly and I had some
cigars It was now that the news came back into my head

What do you think of I began and stopped

I spoke out of a long silence the slack luxurious silence of
digestion I got no answer naturally from the torpid Lin and then it
occurred to me that he would have asked me what I thought long before
this had he known So observing how comfortable he was I began
differently

What is the most important event that can happen in this country said
I

Mr McLean heard me where he lay along the floor of the cabin on his
back dozing by the fire but his eyes remained closed He waggled one
limp open hand slightly at me and torpor resumed her dominion over
him

I want to know what you consider the most important event that can
happen in this country said I again enunciating each word with slow
clearness

The throat and lips of Mr McLean moved and a sulky sound came forth
that I recognized to be meant for the word War Then he rolled over so
that his face was away from me and put an arm over his eyes

I dont mean country in the sense of United States said I I mean
this country here and Bear Creek andwell the ranches southward for
fifty miles say Important to this section

Mosquitoesll be due in about three weeks said Lin Yu might leave
a man rest till then

I want your opinion said I

Oh misery Well a raise in the price of steers

No

Yu said yu wanted my opinion said Lin Seems like yu merely
figure on givin me yours

Very well said I Very well then

I took up a copy of the Cheyenne Sun It was five weeks old and I soon
perceived that I had read it three weeks ago but I read it again for
some minutes now

I expect a railroad would be more important said Mr McLean
persuasively from the floor

Than a rise in steers said I occupied with the Cheyenne Sun Oh
yes Yes a railroad certainly would

Its got to be money anyhow stated Lin thoroughly wakened Money
in some shape

How little you understand the real wants of the country said I
coming to the point Its a girl

Mr McLean lay quite still on the floor

A girl I repeated A new girl coming to this starved country

The cowpuncher took a long gradual stretch and began to smile Well
said he yu caught meif thats much to do when a man is halfwitted
with dinner and sleep He closed his eyes again and lay with a specious
expression of indifference But that sort of thing is a solitary
entertainment and palls Starved he presently muttered We are kind
o starved that way Ill admit More dollars than girls to the square
mile And to think of all of us nice healthy youngbet yu I know who
she is he triumphantly cried He had sat up and levelled a finger at
me with the throwdown jerk of a marksman Sidney Nebraska

I nodded This was not the ladys namehe could not recall her
namebut his geography of her was accurate

One day in February my friend Mrs Taylor over on Bear Creek had
received a letterno common event for her Therefore during several
days she had all callers read it just as naturally as she had them all
see the new baby and baby and letter had both been brought out for me
The letter was signed

Ever your afectionite frend

 Katie Peck

and was not easy to read here and there But you could piece out the
drift of it and there was Mrs Taylor by your side eager to help you
when you stumbled Miss Peck wrote that she was overworked in Sidney
Nebraska and needed a holiday When the weather grew warm she should
like to come to Bear Creek and be like old times Like to come and be
like old times filled Mrs Taylor with sentiment and the cowpunchers
with expectation But it is a long way from February to warm weather on
Bear Creek and even cowpunchers will forget about a new girl if she
does not come For several weeks I had not heard Miss Peck mentioned
and old girls had to do Yesterday however when I paid a visit to Miss
Molly Wood the Bear Creek schoolmistress I found her keeping in
order the cabin and the children of the Taylors while they were gone
fortyfive miles to the stage station to meet their guest

Well said Lin judicially Miss Wood is a lady

Yes said I with deep gravity For I was thinking of an occasion when
Mr McLean had discovered that truth somewhat abruptly

Lin thoughtfully continued She isshessheswhat are you laughin
at

Oh nothing You dont see quite so much of Miss Wood as you used to
do you

Huh So thats got around Well o course Id ought tve knowed
better I suppose All the same theres lots and lots of girls do like
gettin kissed against their wishesand you know it

But the point would rather seem to be that she

Would rather seem Dont yu start that professor style o yours or
IllIll talk more wickedness in worse language than ever yuve heard
me do yet

Impossible I murmured sweetly and Master Lin went on

As to pointthat dont need to be explained to me Shes a lady all
right He ruminated for a moment She has about scared all the boys
off though he continued And thats what you get by being refined
he concluded as if Providence had at length spoken in this matter

She has not scared off a boy from Virginia I notice said I He
was there yesterday afternoon again Ridden all the way over from Sunk
Creek Didnt seem particularly frightened

Oh well nothin alarms himnot even refinement said Mr McLean
with his grin And shell fool your Virginian like she done the balance
of us You wait Shucks If all the girls were that chilly why what
would us poor punchers do

You have me cornered said I and we sat in a philosophical silence
Lin on the floor still and I at the window There I looked out upon
a scene my eyes never tired of then nor can my memory now Spring
had passed over it with its first lightest steps The pastured levels
undulated in emerald Through the manychanging sage that just this
moment of today was lilac shone greens scarce a week old in the
dimples of the foothills and greens newborn beneath todays sun
melted among them Around the doubling of the creek in the willow
thickets glimmered skeined veils of yellow and delicate crimson The
stream poured turbulently away from the snows of the mountains behind
us It went winding in many folds across the meadows into distance
and smallness and so vanished round the great red battlement of wall
beyond Upon this were falling the deep hues of afternoonviolet rose
and saffron swimming and meeting as if some prism had dissolved and
flowed over the turrets and crevices of the sandstone Far over there I
saw a dot move

At last said I

Lin looked out of the window Its more than Tommy said he at
once and his eyes made it out before mine could Its a wagon Thats
Tommys baldfaced horse alongside Hes fooling to the finish Lin
severely commented as if after all this delay there should at least
be a homestretch

Presently however a homestretch seemed likely to occur The baldfaced
horse executed some lively manoeuvres and Tommys voice reached us
faintly through the light spring air He was evidently howling the
remarkable strain of yells that the cowpunchers invented as the speech
best understood by cowsOiee yah whoopyahyeee oooooop oop
oopoopoopoopyahhee But that gives you no idea of it Alphabets
are worse than photographs It is not the lungs of every man that can
produce these effects nor even from armies eagles or mules were such
sounds ever heard on earth The cowpuncher invented them And when
the last cowpuncher is laid to rest if that alas have not already
befallen the yells will be forever gone Singularly enough the cattle
appeared to appreciate them Tommy always did them very badly and that
was plain even at this distance Nor did he give us a homestretch
after all The baldfaced horse made a number of evolutions and returned
beside the wagon

Showin off remarked Lin Tommys showin off Suspicion crossed
his face and then certainty Why we might have knowed that he
exclaimed in dudgeon Its her He hastened outside for a better
look and I came to the door myself Thats what it is said he Its
the girl Oh yes Thats Taylors buckskin pair he traded Balaam for
She come by the stage all right yesterday yu see but she has been
too tired to travel yu see or else maybe Taylor wanted to rest his
buckskinstheyre fouryearolds Or elseanyway they laid over last
night at Powder River and Tommy he has just laid over too yu
see holdin the mail back on us twentyfour hoursand thats your
postmaster

It was our postmaster and this he had done quite as the virtuously
indignant McLean surmised Had I taken the same interest in the new
girl I suppose that I too should have felt virtuously indignant

Lin and I stood outside to receive the travellers As their cavalcade
drew near Mr McLean grew silent and watchful his whole attention
focused upon the Taylors vehicle Its approach was joyous Its gear
made a cheerful clanking Taylor cracked his whip and encouragingly
chirruped to his buckskins and Tommys apparatus jingled musically For
Tommy wore upon himself and his saddle all the things you can wear in
the Wild West Except that his hair was not long our postmaster might
have conducted a show and minted gold by exhibiting his romantic person
before the eyes of princes He began with a blackandyellow rattlesnake
skin for a hatband he continued with a fringed and beaded shirt of
buckskin and concluded with large tinkling spurs Of course there
were things between his shirt and his heels but all leather and deadly
weapons He had also a riata a cuerta and tapaderos and frequently
employed these Spanish names for the objects I wish that I had not lost
Tommys photograph in Rocky Mountain costume You must understand that
he was really pretty with blue eyes ruddy cheeks and a graceful
figure and besides he had twentyfour hours start of poor dusty Lin
whose best clothes were elsewhere

You might have supposed that it would be Mrs Taylor who should present
us to her friend from Sidney Nebraska but Tommy on his horse undertook
the office before the wagon had well come to a standstill Good friends
of mine and gentlemen both said he to Miss Peck and to us A lady
whose acquaintance will prove a treat to our section

We all bowed at each other beneath the florid expanse of these
recommendations and I was proceeding to murmur something about its
being a long journey and a fine day when Miss Peck cut me short gaily

Well she exclaimed to Tommy I guess Im pretty near ready for them
eggs youve spoke so much about

I have not often seen Mr McLean lose his presence of mind He needed
merely to exclaim Why Tommy you told me your hens had not been
laying since Christmas and we could have sat quiet and let Tommy
try to find all the eggs that he could But the new girl was a sore
embarrassment to the cowpunchers wits Poor Lin stood by the wheels
of the wagon He looked up at Miss Peck he looked over at Tommy his
features assumed a rueful expression and he wretchedly blurted

Why Tommy Ive been and eat em

Well if that aint cried Miss Peck She stared with interest at Lin
as he now assisted her to descend

All faltered Tommy Not the four nests

Ive had three meals yu know Lin reminded him deprecatingly

I helped him said I Ten innocent fresh eggs But we have left some
ham Forgive us please

I declare said Miss Peck abruptly and rolled her sluggish inviting
eyes upon me Youre a case too I expect

But she took only brief note of me although it was from head to foot
In her stare the dull shine of familiarity grew vacant and she turned
back to Lin McLean You carry that said she and gave the pleased
cowpuncher a hand valise

Ill look after your things Miss Peck called Tommy now springing
down from his horse The egg tragedy had momentarily stunned him

Youll attend to the mail first Mr Postmaster said the lady
but favoring him with a look from her large eyes Theres plenty of
gentlemen here With that her glance favored Lin She went into the
cabin he following her close with the Taylors and myself in the rear
Well I guess Im about collapsed said she vigorously and sank upon
one of Tommys chairs

The fragile article fell into sticks beneath her and Lin leaped to her
assistance He placed her upon a firmer foundation Mrs Taylor brought
a basin and towel to bathe the dust from her face Mr Taylor produced
whiskey and I found sugar and hot water Tommy would doubtless have
done something in the way of assistance or restoratives but he was gone
to the stable with the horses

Shall I get your medicine from the valise deary inquired Mrs
Taylor

Not now her visitor answered and I wondered why she should take such
a quick look at me

Well soon have yu independent of medicine said Lin gallantly Our
climate and scenery here has frequently raised the dead

Youre a case anyway exclaimed the sick lady with rich conviction

The cowpuncher now sat himself on the edge of Tommys bed and
throwing one leg across the other began to raise her spirits with
cheerful talk She steadily watched himhis face sometimes sometimes
his lounging masculine figure While he thus devoted his attentions to
her Taylor departed to help Tommy at the stable and good Mrs Taylor
busy with supper for all of us in the kitchen expressed her joy at
having her old friend of childhood for a visit after so many years

Sickness has changed poor Katie some said she But Im hoping shell
get back her looks on Bear Creek

She seems less feeble than I had understood I remarked

Yes indeed I do believe shes feeling stronger She was that tired
and down yesterday with the long stageride and it is so lonesome But
Taylor and I heartened her up and Tommy came with the mail and today
shes real sprucedup like feeling shes among friends

How long will she stay I inquired

Just as long as ever she wants Me and Katie hasnt met since we was
young girls in Dubuque for I left home when I married Taylor and he
brought me to this country right soon and it aint been like Dubuque
much though if I had it to do over again Id do just the same as
Taylor knows Katie and me hasnt wrote even not till this February
for you always mean to and you dont Well itll be like old times
Katiell be most thirtyfour I expect Yes I was seventeen and she was
sixteen the very month I was married Poor thing She ought to have got
some good man for a husband but I expect she didnt have any chance
for there was a big famly o them girls and old Peck used to act real
scandalous getting drunk so folks didnt visit there evenings scarcely
at all And so she quit home it seems and got a position in the
railroad eatinghouse at Sidney and now she has poor health with
feeding them big trains day and night

A biscuitshooter said I

Loyal Mrs Taylor stirred some batter in silence Well said she then
Im told thats what the yardhands of the railroad call them poor
waitergirls You might hear it around the switches at them division
stations

I had heard it in higher places also but meekly accepted the reproof

If you have made your transMissouri journeys only since the new era of
diningcars there is a quantity of things you have come too late for
and will never know Three times a day in the brave days of old you
sprang from your scarcehalted car at the summons of a gong You
discerned by instinct the right direction and passing steadily through
doorways had taken before you knew it one of some sixty chairs in
a room of tables and catsup bottles Behind the chairs standing
attention a platoon of Amazons thickwristed pinkandblue began
immediately a swift chant It hymned the total billoffare at a blow
In this inexpressible ceremony the name of every dish went hurtling into
the next telescoped to shapelessness Moreover if you stopped your
Amazon in the middle it dislocated her and she merely went back and
took a fresh start The chant was always the same but you never learned
it As soon as it began your mind snapped shut like the upper berth
in a Pullman You must have uttered appropriate wordseven a parrot
willfor next you were eating thingspie ham hot cakesas fast as
you could Twenty minutes of swallowing and all aboard for Ogden with
your piledriven stomach dumb with amazement The Strasburg goose is
not dieted with greater velocity and biscuitshooter is a grand word
Very likely some Homer of the railroad yards first said itfor what
men upon the present earth so speak with imaginations tongue as we
Americans

If Miss Peck had been a biscuitshooter I could account readily for her
conversation her equipped deportment the maturity in her round blue
marble eye Her abrupt laugh something beyond gay was now sounding
in response to Mr McLeans lively sallies and I found him fanning her
into convalescence with his hat She herself made but few remarks but
allowed the cowpuncher to entertain her merely exclaiming briefly
now and then I declare and If you aint Lin was most certainly
engaging if that was the ladys meaning His wideopen eyes sparkled
upon her and he half closed them now and then to look at her more
effectively I suppose she was worth it to him I have forgotten to say
that she was handsome in a large Californiafruit style They made a
goodlooking pair of animals But it was in the presence of Tommy that
Master Lin shone more energetically than ever and under such shining
Tommy was transparently restless He tried and failed to bring
the conversation his way and took to rearranging the mail and the
furniture

Suppers ready he said at length Come right in Miss Peck right
in here This is your seatthis one please Now you can see my fields
out of the window

You sit here said the biscuitshooter to Lin and thus she was
between them Thems elegant she presently exclaimed to Tommy Did
you cook em

I explained that the apricots were of my preparation

Indeed said she and returned to Tommy who had been telling her of
his ranch his potatoes his horses And do you punch cattle too she
inquired of him

Me said Tommy slightingly gave it up years ago too empty a
life for me I leave that to such as like it When a man owns his own
propertyTommy swept his hand at the whole landscapehe takes to
more intellectual work

Lickin postagestamps Mr McLean suggested sourly

You lick them and I cancel them answered the postmaster and it does
not seem a powerful rejoinder But Miss Peck uttered her laugh

Thats one on you she told Lin And throughout this meal it was Tommy
who had her favor She partook of his generous supplies she listened to
his romantic inventions the trails he had discovered the bears he had
slain and after supper it was with Tommy and not with Lin that she
went for a little walk

Katie was ever a tease said Mrs Taylor of her childhood friend and
Mr Taylor observed that there was always safety in numbers Shell get
used to the ways of this country quicker than our little schoolmarm
said he

Mr McLean said very little but read the newarrived papers It was
only when bedtime dispersed us the ladies in the cabin and the men
choosing various spots outside that he became talkative again for a
while We lay in the blankwe had spread on some soft dry sand in
preference to the stable where Taylor and Tommy had gone Under the
contemplative influence of the stars Lin fell into generalization

Ever notice said he how whiskey and lyin act the same on a man

I did not feel sure that I had

Just the same way You keep either of em up long enough and yu get
to require it If Tommy didnt lie some every day hed get sick

I was sleepy but I murmured assent to this and trusted he would not go
on

Ever notice said he how the victims of the whiskey and lyin habit
get to increasing the dose

Yes said I

Him roping six bears pursued Mr McLean after further contemplation
Or any bear Ever notice how the worser a mans lyin the silenter
other menll get Whys that now

I believe that I made a faint sound to imply that I was following him

Men dont get took in But ladies now they

Here he paused again and during the next interval of contemplation I
sank beyond his reach

In the morning I left Riverside for Buffalo and there or thereabouts I
remained for a number of weeks Miss Peck did not enter my thoughts nor
did I meet any one to remind me of her until one day I stopped at
the drugstore It was not for drugs but gossip that I went In the
daytime there was no place like the apothecarys for meeting men and
hearing the news There I heard how things were going everywhere
including Bear Creek

All the cowpunchers liked the new girl up there said gossip She was
a great addition to society Reported to be more companionable than
the schoolmarm Miss Molly Wood who had been raised too far east and
showed it Vermont or some such dude place Several had been in town
buying presents for Miss Katie Peck Tommy Postmaster had paid high for
a necklace of elktushes the government scout at McKinney sold him
Too bad Miss Peck did not enjoy good health Shorty had been in only
yesterday to get her medicine again Third bottle Had I heard the big
joke on Lin McLean He had promised her the skin of a big bear he knew
the location of and Tommy got the bear

Two days after this I joined one of the roundup camps at sunset They
had been working from Salt Creek to Bear Creek and the Taylor ranch was
in visiting distance from them again after an interval of gathering
and branding far across the country The Virginian the gentlevoiced
Southerner whom I had last seen lingering with Miss Wood was in
camp Silent threequarters of the time as was his way he sat gravely
watching Lin McLean That person seemed silent also as was not his way
quite so much

Lin said the Southerner I reckon youre failin

Mr McLean raised a sombre eye but did not trouble to answer further

A healthy mans laigs ought to fill his pants pursued the Virginian
The challenged puncher stretched out a limb and showed his muscles with
young pride

And yu certnly take no comfort in your food his ingenious friend
continued slowly and gently

Ill eat you a match any day and place yu name said Lin

It aint scacely honable went on the Virginian to waste away
durin the roundup A man owes his strength to them that hires it If
he is paid to rope stock he ought to rope stock and not leave it dodge
or pull away

Its not many dodge my rope boasted Lin imprudently

Why they tell me as how that heifer of the SidneyNebraska brand got
plumb away from yu and little Tommy had to chase afteh her

Lin sat up angrily amid the laughter but reclined again Ill
improve said he if yu learn me how yu rope that Vermont stock so
handy Has she promised to be your sister yet he added

Is that what they do inquired the Virginian serenely I have never
got related that way Why thatll make Tommy your brotherinlaw Lin

And now indeed the camp laughed a loud merciless laugh

But Lin was silent Where everybody lives in a glasshouse the victory
is to him who throws the adroitest stone Mr McLean was readier witted
than most but the gentle slow Virginian could be a master when he
chose

Tommy has been recountin his wars up at the Taylors he now told the
camp He has frequently campaigned with General Crook General
Miles and General Ruger all at onced Hes an exciting fighter in
conversation and kep us all scared for mighty nigh an hour Miss Peck
appeared interested in his statements

What was you doing at the Taylors yourself demanded Lin

Visitin Miss Wood answered the Virginian with entire ease For he
also knew when to employ the plain truth as a bluff Youd ought to
write to Tommys mother Lin and tell her what a daredevil her son is
gettin to be She would cut off his allowance and bring him home and
you would have the runnin all to yourself

Ill fix him yet muttered Mr McLean Him and his wars

With that he rose and left us

The next afternoon he informed me that if I was riding up the creek to
spend the night he would go for company In that direction we started
therefore without any mention of the Taylors or Miss Peck I was
puzzled Never had I seen him thus disconcerted by woman With him woman
had been a transient disturbance I had witnessed a series of flighty
romances where the cowpuncher had come seen often conquered and
moved on Nor had his affairs been of the sort to teach a young man
respect I am putting it rather mildly

For the first part of our way this afternoon he was moody and after
that began to speak with appalling wisdom about life Life he said was
a serious matter Did I realize that A man was liable to forget it A
man was liable to go sporting and helling around till he waked up some
day and found all his best pleasures had become just a business No
interest no surprise no novelty left and no cash in the bank Shorty
owed him fifty dollars Shorty would be able to pay that after the
roundup and he Lin would get his time and rustle altogether some
five hundred dollars Then there was his homestead claim on Box Elder
and the surveyors were coming in this fall No better location for a
home in this country than Box Elder Wood water fine land All it
needed was a house and ditches and buildings and fences and to be
planted with crops Such chances and considerations should sober a
man and make him careful what he did Id take in Cheyenne on our
weddingtrip and after that Id settle right down to improving Box
Elder concluded Mr McLean suddenly

His real intentions flashed upon me for the first time I had not
remotely imagined such a step

Marry her I screeched in dismay Marry her

I dont know which word was the worse to emphasize at such a moment but
I emphasized both thoroughly

I didnt expect yud act that way said the lover He dropped behind
me fifty yards and spoke no more

Not at once did I beg his pardon for the brutality I had been surprised
into It is one of those speeches that once said is said forever

But it was not that which withheld me As I thought of the tone in which
my friend had replied it seemed to me sullen rather than deeply angry
or woundedresentment at my opinion not of her character so much as
of his choice Then I began to be sorry for the fool and schemed for
a while how to intervene But have you ever tried intervention I soon
abandoned the idea and took a way to be forgiven and to learn more

Lin I began slowing my horse you must not think about what I
said

Im thinkin of pleasanter subjects said he and slowed his own
horse

Oh look here I exclaimed

Well said he He allowed his horse to come within about ten yards

Astonishment makes a man say anything I proceeded And Ill say
again youre too good for herand Ill say I dont generally believe in
the wife being older than the husband

Whats two years said Lin

I was near screeching out again but saved myself He was not quite
twentyfive and I remembered Mrs Taylors unprejudiced computation
of the biscuitshooters years It is a ladys prerogative however to
estimate her own age

She had her twentyseventh birthday last month said Lin with
sentiment bringing his horse entirely abreast of mine I promised her
a bearskin

Yes said I I heard about that in Buffalo

Lins face grew dusky with anger No doubt yu heard about it said
he I dont guess yu heard much about anything else I aint told
the truth to any of embut her He looked at me with a certain
hesitation I think I will he continued I dont mind tellin you

He began to speak in a strictly business tone while he evened the coils
of rope that hung on his saddle

She had spoke to me about her birthday and I had spoke to her about
something to give her I had offered to buy her in town whatever she
named and I was figuring to borrow from Taylor But she fancied the
notion of a bearskin I had mentioned about some cubs I had found the
cubs where the shebear had them cached by the foot of a big boulder in
the range over Ten Sleep and I put back the leaves and stuff on top o
them little things as near as I could the way I found them so that the
bear would not suspicion me For I was aiming to get her And Miss Peck
she sure wanted the hide for her birthday So I went back The shebear
was off and I crumb up inside the rock and I waited a turruble long
spell till the sun travelled clean around the canyon Mrs Bear come
home though a big cinnamon and I raised my gun but laid it down to
see what shed do She scrapes around and snuffs and the cubs start
whining and she talks back to em Next she sits up awful big and
lifts up a cub and holds it to her close with both her paws same as a
person And she rubbed her ear agin the cub and the cub sort o nipped
her and she cuffed the cub and the other cub came toddlin and away
they starts rolling all three of em I watched that for a long while
That big thing just nursed and played with them little cubs beatin em
for a change onced in a while and talkin and onced in a while shed
sit up solemn and look all around so lifelike that I near busted Why
how was I goin to spoil that So I come away very quiet you bet for
Id have hated to have Mrs Bear notice me Miss Peck she laughed She
claimed I was scared to shoot

After you had told her why it was said I

Before and after I didnt tell her first because I felt kind of
foolish Then Tommy went and he killed the bear all right and she has
the skin now Of course the boys joshed me a heap about gettin beat by
Tommy

But since she has taken you said I

She aint said it But she will when she understands Tommy

I fancied that the lady understood The once I had seen her she appeared
to me as what might be termed an expert in men and one to understand
also the reality of Tommys ranch and allowance and how greatly these
differed from Box Elder Probably the one thing she could not understand
was why Lin spared the mother and her cubs A deserted home in Dubuque
a career in a railroad eatinghouse a somewhat vague past and a
present lacking contextindeed I hoped with all my heart that Tommy
would win

Lin said I Im backing him

Back away said he Tommy can please a womanhim and his blue
eyesbut he dont savvy how to make a woman want him not any better
than he knows about killin Injuns

Did you hear about the Crows said I

About young bucks going on the warpath Shucks Thats put up by the
papers of this section Theyre aimin to get Uncle Sam to order his
troops out and then folks can sell hay and stuff to em If Tommy
believed any Crows he stopped and suddenly slapped his leg

Whats the matter now I asked

Oh nothing He took to singing and his face grew roguish to its full
extent What made yu say that to me he asked presently

Say what

About marrying Yu dont think Id better

I dont

Onced in a while yu tell me Im flighty Well I am Whoopya

Colts ought not to marry said I

Sure said he And it was not until we came in sight of the
Virginians black horse tied in front of Miss Woods cabin next
the Taylors that Lin changed the lively course of thought that was
evidently filling his mind

Tell yu said he touching my arm confidentially and pointing to
the black horse for all her Vermont refinement shes a woman just the
same She likes him dangling round her so earnesthim that no body ever
saw dangle before And he has quit spreein with the boys And what does
he get by it I am glad I was not raised good enough to appreciate the
Miss Woods of this world he added defiantlyexcept at long range

At the Taylors cabin we found Miss Wood sitting with her admirer and
Tommy from Riverside come to admire Miss Peck The biscuitshooter might
pass for twentyseven certainly Something had agreed with herwhether
the medicine or the mountain air or so much masculine company
whatever had done it she had bloomed into brutal comeliness Her hair
looked curlier her figure was shapelier her teeth shone whiter and
her cheeks were a lusty overbearing red And there sat Molly Wood
talking sweetly to her big grave Virginian to look at them there was
no doubt that he had been raised good enough to appreciate her no
matter what had been his raising

Lin greeted every one jauntily How are yu Miss Peck How are yu
Tommy said he Hear the news Tommy Crow Injuns on the warpath

I declare said the biscuitshooter

The Virginian was about to say something but his eye met Lins and
then he looked at Tommy Then what he did say was I hadnt been goin
to mention it to the ladies until it was right sure

You neednt to be afraid Miss Peck said Tommy Theres lots of men
here

Whos afraid said the biscuitshooter

Oh said Lin maybe its like most news we get in this country Two
weeks stale and a lie when it was fresh

Of course said Tommy

Hello Tommy called Taylor from the lane Your horse has broke his
rein and run down the field

Tommy rose in disgust and sped after the animal

I must be cooking supper now said Katie shortly

Ill stir for yu said Lin grinning at her

Come along then said she and they departed to the adjacent kitchen

Miss Woods gray eyes brightened with mischief She looked at her
Virginian and she looked at me

Do you know she said I used to be so afraid that when Bear Creek
wasnt new any more it might become dull

Miss Peck doesnt find it dull either said I

Molly Wood immediately assumed a look of doubt But mightnt it become
justjust a little trying to have two gentlemen so verydetermined
you know

Only one is determined said the Virginian

Molly looked inquiring

Lin is determined Tommy shall not beat him Thats all it amounts to

Dear me what a notion

No maam no notion Tommywell Tommy is considered harmless maam
A cowpuncher of reputation in this country would certnly never let
Tommy get ahaid of him that way

Its pleasant to know sometimes how much we count exclaimed Molly

Why maam said the Virginian surprised at her flash of indignation
where is any countin without some love

Do you mean to say that Mr McLean does not care for Miss Peck

I reckon he thinks he does But there is a mighty wide difference
between thinkin and feelin maam

I saw Mollys eyes drop from his and I saw the rose deepen in her
cheeks But just then a loud voice came from the kitchen

You Lin if you try any of your foolin with me Ill histe yus over
the jiste

All cowpunchers I attempted to resume

Quit now Lin McLean shouted the voice or Ill put yus through that
window and it shut

Well Miss Peck Im gettin most a full dose o this treatment Ever
since yu come Ive been doing my best And yu just cough in my face
And now Im going to quit and cough back

Would you enjoy walkin out till supper maam inquired the Virginian
as Molly rose You was speaking of gathering some flowers yondeh

Why yes said Molly blithely And youll come she added to me

But I was on the Virginians side I must look after my horse said I
and went down to the corral

Day was slowly going as I took my pony to the water Corncliff Mesa
Crowheart Butte these shone in the rays that came through the canyon
The canyons sides lifted like tawny castles in the same light Where
I walked the odor of thousands of wild roses hung over the margin where
the thickets grew High in the upper air magpies were sailing across
the silent blue Somewhere I could hear Tommy explaining loudly how he
and General Crook had pumped lead into hundreds of Indians and when
suppertime brought us all back to the door he was finishing the account
to Mrs Taylor Molly and the Virginian arrived bearing flowers and he
was saying that few cowpunchers had any reason for saving their money

But when you get old said she

We mostly dont live long enough to get old maam said he simply
But I have a reason and I am saving

Give me the flowers said Molly And she left him to arrange them on
the table as Lin came hurrying out

Ive told her said he to the Southerner and me that Ive asked her
twiced and Im going to let her have one more chance And Ive told her
that if its a log cabin shes marryin why Tommy is a sure good wooden
piece of furniture to put inside it And I guess she knows theres not
much wooden furniture about me I want to speak to you He took the
Virginian round the corner But though he would not confide in me I
began to discern something quite definite at supper

Cattle men will lose stock if the Crows get down as far as this he
said casually and Mrs Taylor suppressed a titter

Aint it hawses there repawted as running off said the Virginian

Chap come into the roundup this afternoon said Lin But he was
rattled and told a heap o facts that wouldnt square

Of course they wouldnt said Tommy haughtily

Oh theres nothing in it said Lin dismissing the subject

Have yu been to the opera since we went to Cheyenne Mrs Taylor

Mrs Taylor had not

Lin said the Virginian did yu ever see that opera Cyarmen

You bet Fellows girl quits him for a bullfighter Gets him up in
the mountains and quits him He wasnt much goodnot in her class o
sports smugglin and such

I reckon she was doubtful of him from the start Took him to the
mountins to experiment where theyd not have interruption said the
Virginian

Talking of mountains said Tommy this range here used to be a great
place for Indians till we ran em out with Terry Pumped lead into the
red sonsofguns

You bet said Lin Do yu figure that girl tired of her bullfighter
and quit him too

I reckon replied the Virginian that the bullfighter wore better

Fans and taverns and gypsies and sportin said Lin My but Id like
to see them countries with oranges and bullfights Only I expect Spain
maybe aint keepin it up so gay as when Carmen happened

The tabletalk soon left romance and turned upon steers and alfalfa a
grass but lately introduced in the country No further mention was made
of the hostile Crows and from this I drew the false conclusion that
Tommy had not come up to their hopes in the matter of reciting his
campaigns But when the hour came for those visitors who were not
spending the night to take their leave Taylor drew Tommy aside with me
and I noticed the Virginian speaking with Molly Wood whose face showed
diversion

Dont seem to make anything of it whispered Taylor to Tommy but the
ladies have got their minds on this Indian truck

Why Ill just explain began Tommy

Dont whispered Lin joining us Yu know how women are Once they
take a notion why the more yu deny the surer they get Now yu see
him and me he jerked his elbow towards the Virginian must go back to
camp for were on second relief

And the ladies would sleep better knowing there was another man in the
house said Taylor

In that case said Tommy I

Yu see said Lin theyve been told about Ten Sleep being burned two
nights ago

It aint cried Tommy

Why of course it aint drawled the ingenious Lin But thats what I
say You and I know Ten Sleeps all right but we cant report from
our own knowledge seeing it all right and there it is They get these
nervous notions

Just dont appear to make anything special of not going back to
Riverside repeated Taylor but

But just kind of stay here said Lin

I will exclaimed Tommy Of course Im glad to oblige

I suppose I was slowsighted All this pains seemed to me larger than
its results They had imposed upon Tommy yes But what of that He
was to be kept from going back to Riverside until morning Unless they
proposed to visit his empty cabin and play tricksbut that would be
too childish even for Lin McLean to say nothing of the Virginian his
occasional partner in mischief

In spite of the Crows I satirically told the ladies I shall sleep
outside as I intended Ive no use for houses at this season

The cinches of the horses were tightened Lin and the Virginian laid
a hand on their saddlehorns swung up and soon all sound of the
galloping horses had ceased Molly Wood declined to be nervous and
crossed to her little neighbor cabin we all parted and as always in
that blessed country deep sleep quickly came to me

I dont know how long after it was that I sprang from my blankets in
halfdoubting fright But I had dreamed nothing A second long
wild yell now gave me I must own to it a horrible chill I had no
pistolnothing In the hateful brightness of the moon my single thought
was House House and I fled across the lane in my underclothes to
the cabin when round the corner whirled the two cowpunchers and I
understood I saw the Virginian catch sight of me in my shirt and saw
his teeth as he smiled I hastened to my blankets and returned more
decent to stand and watch the two go shooting and yelling round
the cabin crazy with their youth The door was opened and Taylor
courageously emerged bearing a Winchester He fired at the sky
immediately

B gosh he roared Thats one He fired again Out and at em
Theyre running

At this duly came Mrs Taylor in white with a pistol and Miss Peck in
white staring and stolid But no Tommy Noise prevailed without shots
by the stable and shots by the creek The two cowpunchers dismounted
and joined Taylor Maniac delight seized me and I too rushed about
with them helping the din

Oh Mr Taylor said a voice I didnt think it of you It was Molly
Wood come from her cabin very pretty in a hoodandcloak arrangement
She stood by the fence laughing but more at us than with us

Stop friends said Taylor gasping She teaches my Bobbie his A B C
Id hate to have Bobbie

Speak to your papa said Molly and held her scholar up on the fence

Well Ill be goldarned said Taylor surveying his costume if Lin
McLean hasnt made a fool of me tonight

Where has Tommy got said Mrs Taylor

Didnt yus see him said the biscuitshooter speaking her first word
in all this

We followed her into the kitchen The table was covered with tin plates
Beneath it wedged knelt Tommy with a pistol firm in his hand but the
plates were rattling up and down like castanets

There was a silence among us and I wondered what we were going to do

Well murmured the Virginian to himself if I could have foresaw Id
notit makes yu feel humiliated yuself

He marched out got on his horse and rode away Lin followed him but
perhaps less penitently We all dispersed without saying anything
and presently from my blankets I saw poor Tommy come out of the silent
cabin mount and slowly very slowly ride away He would spend the
night at Riverside after all

Of course we recovered from our unexpected shame and the tale of the
table and the dancing plates was not told as a sad one But it is a sad
one when you think of it

I was not there to see Lin get his bride I learned from the Virginian
how the victorious puncher had ridden away across the sunny sagebrush
bearing the biscuitshooter with him to the nearest justice of the
peace She was astride the horse he had brought for her

Yes he beat Tommy said the Virginian Some folks anyway get what
they want in this hyeh world

From which I inferred that Miss Molly Wood was harder to beat than
Tommy





LIN McLEANS HONEYMOON

Rain had not fallen for some sixty days and for some sixty more there
was no necessity that it should fall It is spells of weather like this
that set the Western editor writing praise and prophecy of the boundless
fertility of the soilwhen irrigated and of what an Eden it can be
madewith irrigation but the spells annoy the people who are trying
to raise the Eden We always told the transient Eastern visitor when he
arrived at Cheyenne and criticised the desert that anything would grow
herewith irrigation and sometimes he replied unsympathetically that
anything could flywith wings Then we would lead such a man out and
show him six eight ten square miles of green crops and he if he
was thoroughly nasty would mention that Wyoming contained ninetyfive
thousand square miles all waiting for irrigation and Eden One of these
Eastern supercivilized hostiles from New York was breakfasting with the
Governor and me at the Cheyenne Club and we were explaining to him
the glorious future the coming empire of the Western country Now the
Governor was about thirtytwo and until twentyfive had never gone West
far enough to see over the top of the Alleghany Mountains I was not a
pioneer myself and why both of us should have pitied the NewYorkers
narrowness so hard I cannot see But we did We spoke to him of the size
of the country We told him that his State could rattle round inside
Wyomings stomach without any inconvenience to Wyoming and he told us
that this was because Wyomings stomach was empty Altogether I began to
feel almost sorry that I had asked him to come out for a hunt and had
travelled in haste all the way from Bear Creek to Cheyenne expressly to
meet him

For purposes of amusement he said Ill admit anything you claim
for this place Ranches cowboys elk its all splendid Only as an
investment I prefer the East Am I to see any cowboys

You shall I said and I distinctly hoped some of them might do
something to him for purposes of amusement

You fellows come up with me to my office said the Governor Ill
look at my mail and show you round So we went with him through the
heat and sun

Whats that inquired the NewYorker whom I shall call James Ogden

That is our park said I Of course its merely in embryo Its
wonderful how quickly any shade tree will grow here wi I checked
myself

But Ogden said with irrigation for me and I was entirely sorry he had
come

We reached the Governors office and sat down while he looked his
letters over

Here you are Ogden said he Heres the way we hump ahead out here
And he read us the following

 MAGAW KANSAS July 5 188

Hon Amory W Baker

SirUnderstanding that your district is suffering from a prolonged
drought I write to say that for necessary expenses paid I will be glad
to furnish you with a reasonably shower I have operated successfully
in Australia Mexico and several States of the Union and am anxious to
exhibit my system If your Legislature will appropriate a sum to cover
as I said merely my necessary expensessay 350 three hundred and
fifty dollarsfor half an inch I will guarantee you that quantity of
rain or forfeit the money If I fail to give you the smallest fraction
of the amount contracted for there is to be no pay Kindly advise me of
what date will be most convenient for you to have the shower I require
twentyfour hours preparation Hoping a favorable reply

 I am respectfully yours

 Robert Hilbrun

Will the Legislature do it inquired Ogden in good faith

The Governor laughed boisterously I guess it wouldnt be
constitutional said he

Oh bother said Ogden

My dear man the Governor protested I know were new and our women
vote and were a good deal of a joke but were not so progressively
funny as all that The people wouldnt stand it Senator Warren would
fly right into my back hair Barker was also new as Governor

Do you have Senators here too said Ogden raising his eyebrows
What do they look like Are they females And the Governor grew more
boisterous than ever slapping his knee and declaring that these Eastern
men were certainly out of sight Ogden however was thoughtful

Id have been willing to chip in for that rain myself he said

Thats an idea cried the Governor Nothing unconstitutional about
that Lets see Three hundred and fifty dollars

Ill put up a hundred said Ogden promptly Im out for a Western
vacation and Ill pay for a good specimen

The Governor and I subscribed more modestly and by noon with the help
of some lively minded gentlemen of Cheyenne we had the purse raised
He wont care said the Governor whether its a private enterprise
or a municipal step so long as he gets his money

He wont get it Im afraid said Ogden But if he succeeds in
tempting Providence to that extent I consider it cheap Now what do you
call those people there on the horses

We were walking along the track of the Cheyenne and Northern and
looking out over the plain toward Fort Russell That is a cowpuncher
and his bride I answered recognizing the couple

Real cowpuncher

Quite The punchers name is Lin McLean

Real bride

Im afraid so

Shes riding straddle exclaimed the delighted Ogden adjusting his
glasses Why do you object to their union being holy

I explained that my friend Lin had lately married an eatinghouse lady
precipitately and against my advice

I suppose he knew his business observed Ogden

Thats what he said to me at the time But you ought to see herand
know him

Ogden was going to Husband and wife were coming our way Husband nodded
to me his familiar offish nod which concealed his satisfaction at
meeting with an old friend Wife did not look at me at all But I looked
at her and I instantly knew that Linthe foolhad confided to her my
disapproval of their marriage The most delicate specialty upon earth is
your standing with your old friends new wife

Goodday Mr McLean said the Governor to the cowpuncher on his
horse

Howre are yu doctor said Lin During his early days in Wyoming the
Governor when as yet a private citizen had set Mr McLeans broken leg
at Drybone Let me make yu known to Mrs McLean pursued the husband

The lady at a loss how convention prescribes the greeting of a bride to
a Governor gave a waddle on the ponys back then sat up stiff gazed
haughtily at the air and did not speak or show any more sign than a cow
would under like circumstances So the Governor marched cheerfully at
her extending his hand and when she slightly moved out toward him her
big dumb red fist he took it and shook it and made her a series of
compliments she maintaining always the scrupulous reserve of the cow

I say Ogden whispered to me while Barker was pumping the hand of the
flesh image Im glad I came The appearance of the puncherbridegroom
also interested Ogden and he looked hard at Lins leather chaps and
cartridgebelt and so forth Lin stared at the NewYorker and his high
white collar and good scarf He had seen such things quite often of
course but they always filled him with the same distrust of the man
that wore them

Well said he I guess well be pulling for a hotel Any show in
town Circus come yet

No said I Are you going to make a long stay

The cowpuncher glanced at the image his bride of three weeks Till
were tired of it I guess said he with hesitation It was the first
time that I had ever seen my gay friend look timidly at any one and I
felt a rising hate for the rubychecked largeeyed eatinghouse
lady the biscuitshooter whose influence was dimming this jaunty
irrepressible spirit I looked at her Her bulky bloom had ensnared him
and now she was going to tame and spoil him The Governor was looking at
her too thoughtfully

Say Lin I said if you stay here long enough youll see a big
show And his eye livened into something of its native jocularity as I
told him of the rainmaker

Shucks said he springing from his horse impetuously and hugely
entertained at our venture Three hundred and fifty dollars Let me
come in and before I could tell him that we had all the money raised
he was hauling out a wadded lump of bills

Well I aint going to starve here in the road I guess spoke the
image with the suddenness of a miracle I think we all jumped and I
know that Lin did The image continued Some folks and their money are
soon partedshe meant me her searching tones came straight at me I
was sure from the first that she knew all about me and my unfavorable
opinion of herbut it aint going to be you this time Lin McLean Ged
ap This last was to the horse I maintain though the Governor says
the husband immediately started off on a run

At any rate they were gone to their hotel and Ogden was seated on some
railroad ties exclaiming Oh I like Wyoming I am certainly glad I
came

Thats who she is said the Governor remembering Mrs McLean all at
once I know her She used to be at Sidney Shes got another husband
somewhere Shes one of the boys Oh thats nothing in this country
he continued to the amazed Ogden who had ejaculated Bigamy Lots of
them marry live together awhile get tired and quit travel catch on
to a new man marry him get tired and quit travel catch on

One moment I beg said Ogden adjusting his glasses What does the
law

Law said the Governor Look at that place He swept his hand
towards the vast plains and the mountains Ninetyfive thousand square
miles of that and sixty thousand people in it We havent got policemen
yet on top of the Rocky Mountains

I see said the NewYorker Butbutwell let A and B represent
first and second husbands and X represent the woman Now does A know
about B or does B know about A And what do they do about it

Cant say the Governor answered jovially Cant generalize Depends
on heaps of thingslovemoneyDid you go to college Well let A
minus X equal B plus X then if A and B get squared

Oh come to lunch I said Barker do you really know the first
husband is alive

Wasnt dead last winter And Barker gave us the particulars Miss
Katie Peck had not served long in the restaurant before she was
wooed and won by a man who had been a ranch cook a sheepherder
a bartender a freight hand and was then hauling poles for the
government During his necessary absences from home she too went
outofdoors This he often discovered and would beat her and she
would then also beat him After the beatings one of them would always
leave the other forever Thus was Sidney kept in smalltalk until
Mrs Lusk one day really did not come back Lusk said the Governor
finishing his story cried around the saloons for a couple of days and
then went on hauling poles for the government till at last he said
hed heard of a better job south and next we knew of him he was round
Leavenworth Lusk was a pretty poor bird Owes me ten dollars

Well I said none of us ever knew about him when she came to stay
with Mrs Taylor on Bear Creek She was Miss Peck when Lin made her Mrs
McLean

Youll notice said the Governor how she has got him under in three
weeks Old hand you see

Poor Lin I said

Lucky I call him said the Governor He can quit her

Supposing McLean does not want to quit her

Shes educating him to want to right now and I think hell learn
pretty quick I guess Mr Lins romance wasnt very ideal this trip
Hello here comes Jode Jode wont you lunch with us Mr Ogden of New
York Mr Jode Mr Jode is our signalservice officer Mr Ogden The
Governors eyes were sparkling hilariously and he winked at me

Gentlemen goodmorning Mr Ogden I am honored to make your
acquaintance said the signalservice officer

Jode when is it going to rain said the Governor anxiously

Now Jode is the most extraordinarily solemn man I have ever known He
has the solemnity of all science added to the unspeakable weight of
representing five of the oldest families in South Carolina The Jodes
themselves were not old in South Carolina but immensely so inI think
he told me it was Long Island His name is Poinsett Middleton Manigault
Jode He used to weigh a hundred and twentyeight pounds then but his
health has strengthened in that climate His clothes were black his
face was white with black eyes sharp as a pin he had the shape of a
spoutthe same narrow size all the way downand his voice was as
dry and light as an eggshell In his first days at Cheyenne he had
constantly challenged large cowboys for taking familiarities with
his dignity and they after one moments bewilderment had concocted
apologies that entirely met his exactions and gave them much
satisfaction also Nobody would have hurt Jode for the world In time he
came to see that Wyoming was a game invented after his book of rules was
published and he looked on but could not play the game He had fallen
along with other incongruities into the roaring Western hotchpot and
he passed his careful precise days with barometers and weathercharts

He answered the Governor with official and South Carolina
impressiveness There is no indication of diminution of the prevailing
pressure he said

Well thats what I thought said the joyous Governor so Im going
to whoop her up

What do you expect to whoop up sir

Atmosphere and all that said the Governor Whole business has got
to get a move on Ive sent for a rainmaker

Governor you are certainly a wag sir said Jode who enjoyed Barker
as some people enjoy a symphony without understanding it But after we
had reached the club and were lunching and Jode realized that a letter
had actually been written telling Hilbrun to come and bring his showers
with him the punctilious signalservice officer stated his position
Have your joke sir he said waving a thin clean hand but I
decline to meet him

Hilbrun said the Governor staring

If thats his nameyes sir As a member of the Weather Bureau and the
Meteorological Society I can have nothing to do with the fellow

Glory said the Governor Well I suppose not I see your point
Jode Ill be careful to keep you apart As a member of the College of
Physicians Ive felt that way about homeopathy and the faithcure
All very well if patients will call em in but cant meet em in
consultation But three months drought annually Jode Its slowtoo
slow The Western people feel that this conservative method the Zodiac
does its business by is out of date

I am quite serious sir said Jode And let me express my
gratification that you do see my point So we changed the subject

Our weather scheme did not at first greatly move the public Beyond
those who made up the purse few of our acquaintances expressed
curiosity about Hilbrun and next afternoon Lin McLean told me in
the street that he was disgusted with Cheyennes coldness toward the
enterprise But the boys would fly right at it and stay with it if the
roundup was near town you bet said he

He was walking alone Hows Mrs McLean today I inquired

Shes well said Lin turning his eye from mine Whos your friend
all bugged up in English clothes

About as good a man as you said I and more cautious

Him and his eyeglasses said the sceptical puncher still looking
away from me and surveying Ogden who was approaching with the Governor
That excellent man still at long range broke out smiling till his
teeth shone and he waved a yellow paper at us

Telegram from Hilbrun he shouted be here tomorrow and he
hastened up

Says he wants a cart at the depot and a small building where he can be
private added Ogden Great isnt it

You bet said Lin brightening The New Yorkers urbane but obvious
excitement mollified Mr McLean Ever seen rain made Mr Ogden said
he

Never Have you

Lin had not Ogden offered him a cigar which the puncher pronounced
excellent and we all agreed to see Hilbrun arrive

Were going to show the telegram to Jode said the Governor and he
and Ogden departed on this mission to the signal service

Well I must be getting along myself said Lin but he continued
walking slowly with me Wherere yu bound he said

Nowhere in particular said I And we paced the board sidewalks a
little more

Youre going to meet the train tomorrow said he

The train Oh yes Hilbruns Tomorrow Youll be there

Yes Ill be there Its sure been a dry spell aint it

Yes Just like last year In fact like all the years

Yes Ive never saw it rain any to speak of in summer I expect its
the rule Dont you

I shouldnt wonder

I dont guess any man knows enough to break such a rule Do you

No But itll be fun to see him try

Sure fun Well I must be getting along See yu tomorrow

See you tomorrow Lin

He left me at a corner and I stood watching his tall depressed figure
A hundred yards down the street he turned and seeing me looking after
him pretended he had not turned and then I took my steps toward the
club telling myself that I had been something of a skunk for I had
inquired for Mrs McLean in a certain tone and I had hinted to Lin that
he had lacked caution and this was nothing but a way of saying I told
you so to the man that is down Down Lin certainly was although it had
not come so home to me until our little walk together just now along the
boards

At the club I found the Governor teaching Ogden a Cheyenne specialtya
particular drink the Allston cocktail Its the bitters that does the
trick he was saying but saw me and called out You ought to have
been with us and seen Jode I showed him the telegram you know He read
it through and just handed it back to me and went on monkeying with
his anemometer Ever seen his instruments Every fresh jigger they get
out he sends for Well he monkeyed away and wouldnt say a word so
I said You understand Jode this telegram comes from Hilbrun And
Jode he quit his anemometer and said I make no doubt sir that your
despatch is genuwine Oh South Carolinas indignant at me And
the Governor slapped his knee Why hes so set against Hilbrun he
continued I guess if he knew of something he could explode to stop
rain hed let her fly

No he wouldnt said I Hed not consider that honorable

Thats so the Governor assented Jodell play fair

It was thus we had come to look at our enterprisea game between a
wellestablished respectable weather bureau and an upstart charlatan
And it was the charlatan had our sympathyas all charlatans whether
religious military medical political or what not have with the
average American We met him at the station That is Ogden McLean and
I and the Governor being engaged sent unofficially his secretary
and the requested cart Lin was anxious to see what would be put in the
cart and I was curious about how a rainmaker would look But he turned
out an unassuming quiet man in blue serge with a face you could not
remember afterwards and a few civil ordinary remarks He even said it
was a hot day as if he had no relations with the weather and what he
put into the cart were only two packingboxes of no special significance
to the eye He desired no lodging at the hotel but to sleep with his
apparatus in the building provided for him and we set out for it at
once It was an untenanted barn and he asked that he and his assistant
might cut a hole in the roof upon which we noticed the assistant for
the first timea tallish goodlooking young man but with a weak
mouth This is Mr Lusk said the rainmaker and we shook hands
Ogden and I exchanging a glance Ourselves and the cart marched up Hill
Streetor Capitol Avenue as it has become named since Cheyenne has
grown fuller of pomp and emptier of prosperityand I thought we made an
unusual procession the Governors secretary unofficially leading the
way to the barn the cart and the rainmaker beside it guarding his
packedup mysteries McLean and Lusk walking together in unconscious
bigamy and in the rear Odgen nudging me in the ribs That it was the
correct Lusk we had with us I felt sure from his incompetent healthy
vacant appearance strongbodied and shiftlessthe sort of man to weary
of one trade and another and make a failure of wife beating between
whiles In Twentyfourth Streetthe towns uttermost rimthe Governor
met us and stared at Lusk Christopher was his single observation
but he never forgets a facecannot afford to now that he is in
politics and besides Lusk remembered him You seldom really forget a
man to whom you owe ten dollars

So youve quit hauling poles said the Governor

Nothing in it sir said Lusk

Is there any objection to my having a hole in the roof asked the
rainmaker for this the secretary had been unable to tell him

What going to throw your bombs through it said the Governor smiling
heartily

But the rainmaker explained at once that his was not the bomb system
but a method attended by more rain and less disturbance Not that
the bomb dont produce firstclass results at times and under
circumstances he said but its uncertain and costly

The Governor hesitated about the hole in the roof which Hilbrun told
us was for a metal pipe to conduct his generated gases into the air The
owner of the barn had gone to Laramie However we found a stovepipe
hole which saved delay And what day would you prefer the shower
said Hilbrun after we had gone over our contract with him

Any day would do the Governor said

This was Thursday and Sunday was chosen as a day when no one had
business to detain him from witnessing the showerthough it seemed to
me that on weekdays too business in Cheyenne was not so inexorable
as this We gave the strangers some information about the town and left
them The sun went away in a cloudless sky and came so again when the
stars had finished their untarnished shining Friday was clear and dry
and hot like the dynasty of blazing days that had gone before

I saw a sorry spectacle in the streetthe bridegroom and the bride
shopping together or rather he with his wad of bills was obediently
paying for what she bought and when I met them he was carrying a
scarlet parasol and a bonnetbox His biscuitshooter with the lust of
purchase on her was brilliantly dressed and pervaded the street with
splendor like an escaped parrot Lin walked beside her but it might as
well have been behind and his bearing was so different from his
wonted happygoluckiness that I had a mind to take off my hat and say
Goodmorning Mrs Lusk But it was Mrs McLean I said of course
She gave me a remote imperious nod and said Come on Lin
something like a cross nurse while he out of sheer decency made her a
goodhumored jocular answer and said to me It takes a woman to know
what to buy for housekeepin which poor piece of hypocrisy endeared
him to me more than ever The puncher was not of the fibre to succeed in
keeping appearances but he deserved success which the angels consider
to be enough I wondered if disenchantment had set in or if this were
only the preliminary stage of surprise and wounding and I felt that but
one test could show namely a coming face to face of Mr and Mrs
Lusk perhaps not to be desired Neither was it likely The assistant
rainmaker kept himself steadfastly inside or near the barn at the
north corner of Cheyenne while the bride when she was in the street at
all haunted the shops clear across town diagonally

On this Friday noon the appearance of the metal tube above the blind
building spread some excitement It moved several of the citizens to pay
the place a visit and ask to see the machine These callers of course
sustained a polite refusal and returned among their friends with a
contempt for such quackery and a greatly heightened curiosity so that
pretty soon you could hear discussions at the street corners and by
Saturday morning Cheyenne was talking of little else The town prowled
about the barn and its oracular metal tube and heard and saw nothing
The Governor and I let it be confessed went there ourselves since the
twentyfour hours of required preparation were now begun We smelled for
chemicals and he thought there was a something but having been bred a
doctor distrusted his imagination I could not be sure myself whether
there was anything or not although I walked three times round the
barn snuffing as dispassionately as I knew how It might possibly be
chlorine the Governor said or some gas for which ammonia was in part
responsible and this was all he could say and we left the place The
world was as still and the hard sharp hills as clear and near as ever
and the sky over Sahara is not more dry and enduring than was ours
This tenacity in the elements plainly gave Jode a malicious official
pleasure We could tell it by his talk at lunch and when the Governor
reminded him that no rain was contracted for until the next day he
mentioned that the approach of a storm is something that modern science
is able to ascertain long in advance and he bade us come to his office
whenever we pleased and see for ourselves what science said This was
at any rate something to fill the afternoon with and we went to him
about five Lin McLean joined us on the way I came upon him lingering
alone in the street and he told me that Mrs McLean was calling on
friends I saw that he did not know how to spend the short recess or
holiday he was having He seemed to cling to the society of others and
with them for the time regain his gayer mind He had become converted
to Ogden and the NewYorker on his side found pleasant and refreshing
this democracy of Governors and cowpunchers Jode received us at the
signalservice office and began to show us his instruments with the
careful pride of an orchidcollector

A hair hygrometer he said to me waving his waxlike hand over it
The indications are obtained from the expansion and contraction of
a prepared human hair transferred to an index needle traversing the
divided arc of

What oil do you put on the human hair Jode called out the Governor
who had left our group and was gamboling about by himself among the
tubes and dials What will this one do he asked and poked at a wet
paper disc But before the courteous Jode could explain that it had
to do with evaporation and the dewpoint the Governors attention
wandered and he was blowing at a little fanwheel This instantly
revolved and set a number of dial hands going different ways Hi said
the Governor delighted Seen em like that down mines Register air
velocity in feet Put it away Jode You dont want that tomorrow What
youll need Hilbrun says is a big old raingauge and rubber shoes

I shall require nothing of the sort Governor Jode retorted at once
And you can go to church without your umbrella in safety sir See
there He pointed to a stormglass which was certainly as clear as
crystal An oldfashioned test you will doubtless say gentlemen
Jode continuedthough none of us would have said anything like
thatbut unjustly discredited and furthermore its testimony is well
corroborated as you will find you must admit Jodes voice was almost
threatening and he fetched one corroborator after another I looked
passively at wet and dry bulbs at selfrecording dotted registers
I caught the fleeting sound of words like meniscus and terrestrial
minimum thermometer and I nodded punctually when Jode went through
some calculation At last I heard something that I could understanda
series of telegraphic replies to Jode from brother signalservice
officers all over the United States He read each one through from date
of signature and they all made any rain tomorrow entirely impossible
And I tell you Jode concluded in his high eggshell voice theres
no chance of precipitation now sir I tell you sirhe was shrieking
jubilantlytheres not a damn thing to precipitate

We left him in his triumph among his glass and mercury Gee whiz said
the Governor I guess wed better go and tell Hilbrun its no use

We went and Hilbrun smiled with a certain compassion for the antiquated
scientist Thats what they all say he said Ill do my talking
tomorrow

If any of you gentlemen or your friends said Assistant Lusk
stepping up feel like doing a little business on this I am ready to
accommodate you

What do yu want this evenin said Lin McLean promptly

Five to one said Lusk

Go yu in twenties said the impetuous puncher and I now perceived
this was to be a sporting event Lin had his wad of bills outor
what of it still survived his brides shopping Will you hold stakes
doctor he said to the Governor

But that official looked at the clear sky and thought he would do five
to one in twenties himself Lusk accommodated him and then Ogden and
then me None of us could very well be stakeholder but we registered
our bets and promised to procure an uninterested man by eight next
morning I have seldom had so much trouble and I never saw such a
universal search for ready money Every man we asked to hold stakes
instantly whipped out his own pocketbook went in search of Lusk and
disqualified himself It was Jode helped us out He would not bet but
was anxious to serve and thus punish the bragging Lusk

Sunday was as usual chronically fine with no cloud or breeze
anywhere and by the time the churchbells were ringing ten to one was
freely offered The biscuitshooter went to church with her friends so
she might wear her fine clothes in a worthy place while her furloughed
husband rushed about Cheyenne entirely his own old self again his wad
of money staked and in Jodes keeping Many citizens bitterly lamented
their lack of ready money But it was a good thing for these people that
it was Sunday and the banks closed

The churchbells ceased the congregations sat inside but outside
the hot town showed no Sunday emptiness or quiet The metal tube
the possible smell Jodes sustained and haughty indignation the
extraordinary assurance of Lusk all this had ended by turning every one
restless and eccentric A citizen came down the street with an umbrella
In a moment the bystanders had reduced it to a sordid tangle of ribs
Old Judge Burrage attempted to address us at the corner about the vast
progress of science The postmaster pinned a card on his back with the
wellknown legend I am somewhat of a liar myself And all the while
the sun shone high and hot while Jode grew quieter and colder under the
certainty of victory It was after twelve oclock when the people came
from church and no change or sign was to be seen Jode told us with
a chill smile that he had visited his instruments and found no new
indications Fifteen minutes after that the sky was brown Sudden
padded dropsical clouds were born in the blue above our heads They
blackened and a smart shower the first in two months wet us all
and ceased The sun blazed out and the sky came blue again like those
rapid unconvincing weather changes of the drama

Amazement at what I saw happening in the heavens took me from things
on earth and I was unaware of the universal fit that now seized
upon Cheyenne until I heard the high cry of Jode at my ear His usual
punctilious bearing had forsaken him and he shouted alike to stranger
and acquaintance It is no halfinch sir Dont you tell me And the
crowd would swallow him but you could mark his vociferous course as
he went proclaiming to the world A failure sir The fellows an
impostor as I well knew Its no halfinch Which was true

What have you got to say to that we asked Hilbrun swarming around
him

If youll just keep cool said heits only the first instalment In
about two hours and a half Ill give you the rest

Soon after four the dropsical clouds materialized once again above
openmouthed Cheyenne No school let out for an unexpected holiday no
herd of stampeded range cattle conducts itself more miscellaneously
Gray respectable men with daughters married leaped over fences
and sprang back prominent legislators hopped howling up and down
doorsteps women waved handkerchiefs from windows and porches the
chattering Jode flew from anemometer to raingauge and old Judge
Burrage apostrophized Providence in his front yard with the
postmasters label still pinned to his back Nobody minded the sluicing
downpourthis second instalment was much more of a thing than the
firstand Hilbrun alone kept a calm exteriorthe face of the man who
lifts a heavy dumbbell and throws an impressive glance at the audience
Assistant Lusk was by no means thus proof against success I saw him put
a bottle back in his pocket his face already disintegrated with a tipsy
leer Judge Burrage perceiving the rainmaker came out of his gate
and proceeded toward him extending the hand of congratulation Mr
Hilbrun said he I am Judge Burragethe Honorable T Coleman
Burrageand I will say that I am most favorably impressed with your
shower

His shower yelped Jode flourishing measurements

Why yu dont claim its yourn do yu said Lin McLean grinning

I tell you its no halfinch yet gentlemen said Jode ignoring the
facetious puncher

Youre mistaken said Hilbrun sharply

Its a plumb big show halfinch or no halfinch said Lin

If hes short he dont get his money said some ignoble subscriber

Yes he will said the Governor or Im a short Hes earned it

You bet  said Lin Fair and square If theyre goin back on yu
doctor Ill chipShucks Lins hand fell from the empty pocket
he remembered his wad in the stakeholders hands and that he now
possessed possibly two dollars in silver all told I cant chip
in doctor he said That hobo over there has won my cash an hes
filling up on the prospect right now I dont care Its the biggest
show Ive ever saw Youre a dandy Mr Hilbrun Whoop And Lin
clapped the rainmaker on the shoulder exulting He had been too well
entertained to care what he had in his pocket and his wife had not yet
occurred to him

They were disputing about the rainfall which had been slightly under
half an inch in a few spots but over it in many others and while we
stood talking in the renewed sunlight more telegrams were brought to
Jode saying that there was no moisture anywhere and simultaneously
with these riders dashed into town with the news that twelve miles out
the rain had flattened the grain crop We had more of such reports from
as far as thirty miles and beyond that there had not been a drop or a
cloud It staggered ones reason the brain was numb with surprise

Well gentlemen said the rainmaker Im packed up and my trainll
be along soonwould have been along by this only its late Whats the
word as to my three hundred and fifty dollars

Even still there were objections expressed He had not entirely
performed his side of the contract

I think different gentlemen said he But Ill unpack and let that
train go I cant have the law on you I suppose But if you dont pay
me the rainmaker put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the
fence Ill flood your town

In earthquakes and eruptions people end by expecting anything and in
the total eclipse that was now over all Cheyennes ordinary standards
and precedents the bewildered community saw in this threat nothing more
unusual than if he had said twice two made four The purse was handed
over

Im obliged said Hilbrun simply

If I had foreseen gentlemen said Jode too deeply grieved now to
feel anger that I would even be indirectly associated with your losing
your money through thisthis absurd occurrence I would have declined
to help you It becomes my duty he continued turning coldly to
the inebriated Lusk to hand this to you sir And the assistant
lurchingly stuffed his stakes away

Its worth it said Lin Hes welcome to my cash

Whats that you say Lin McLean It was the biscuitshooter and she
surged to the front

Im broke Hes got it Thats all said Lin briefly

Broke You She glared at her athletic young lord and she uttered a
preliminary howl

At that longlost cry Lusk turned his silly face Its my darling
Kate he said Why Kate

The next thing that I knew Ogden and I were grappling with Lin McLean
for everything had happened at once The bride had swooped upon her
first wedded love and burst into tears on the mans neck which Lin
was trying to break in consequence We do not always recognize our
benefactors at sight They all came to the ground and we hauled the
second husband off The lady and Lusk remained in a heap he foolish
tearful and affectionate she turned furiously at bay his guardian
angel indifferent to the onlooking crowd and hurling righteous
defiance at Lin Dont yus dare lay yer finger on my husband you
sagebrush bigamist is what the marvelous female said

Bigamist repeated Lin dazed at this charge I aint he said to
Ogden and me I never did Ive never married any of em before her

Little good thatll do yus Lin McLean Me and him was man and wife
before ever I come acrosst yus

You and him murmured the puncher

Her and me whimpered Lusk Sidney He sat up with a limp confiding
stare at everybody

Sidney who said Lin

No no corrected Lusk crosslySidney Nebraska

The stakes at this point fell from his pocket which he did not notice
But the bride had them in safekeeping at once

Who are yu anywaywhen yu aint drunk demanded Lin

Hes as good a man as you and better snorted the guardian angel
Give him a pistol and hell make you hard to find

Well you listen to me Sidney Nebraska Lin began

No no corrected Lusk once more as a distant whistle blewJim

Goodbye gentlemen said the rainmaker Thats the westbound Im
perfectly satisfied with my experiment here and Im off to repeat it at
Salt Lake City

You are shouted Lin McLean Him and Jims going to work it again
For goodness sake somebody lend me twentyfive dollars

At this there was an instantaneous rush Ten minutes later in front of
the ticketwindows there was a line of citizens buying tickets for Salt
Lake as if it had been Madame Bernhardt Some rock had been smitten
and ready money had flowed forth The Governor saw us off sad that his
duties should detain him But Jode went

Betting is the fools argument gentlemen said he to Ogden McLean
and me and its a weary time since I have had the pleasure

Which way are yu bettin Lin asked

With my principles sir answered the little signalservice officer

I expect I aint got any said the puncher Its Jim Im backin this
time

See here said I I want to talk to you We went into another car
and I did

And so yu knowed about Lusk when we was on them board walks the
puncher said

Do you mean I ought to have

Shucks no Yu couldnt Nobody couldnt Its a queer world all
the same Yu have good friends and all that He looked out of the
window Laramie already he commented and got out and walked by
himself on the platform until we had started again Yu have good
friends he pursued settling himself so his long legs were stretched
and comfortable and they tell yu things and you tell them things
And when it dont make no particular matter one way or the other yu
give em your honest opinion and talk straight to em and theyll
come to you the same way So that when yure ridin the range alone
sometimes and thinkin a lot o things over on top maybe of some
doggoned hill youll say to yourself about some fellow yu know mighty
well Theres a man is a good friend of mine And yu mean it And
its so Yet when matters is serious as onced in a while theyre bound
to get and yure in a plumb hole where is the man thenyour good
friend Why hes where yu want him to be Standin off keepin his
mouth shut and lettin yu find your own trail out If he tried to show
it to yu yud likely hit him But shucks Circumstances have showed
me the trail this time you bet And the punchers face which had been
sombre grew lively and he laid a friendly hand on my knee

The trails pretty simple said I

You bet But its sure a queer world Tell yu said Lin with the air
of having made a discovery when a man gets down to bedrock affairs
in this life hes got to do his travellin alone same as he does his
dyin I expect even married men has thoughts and hopes they dont tell
their wives

Never was married said I

Wellno more was I Lets go to bed And Lin shook my hand and gave
me a singular rather melancholy smile

At Salt Lake City which Ogden was glad to include in his Western
holiday we found both Mormon and Gentile ready to give us odds against
rainonly I noticed that those of the true faith were less free
Indeed the Mormon the Quaker and most sects of an isolated doctrine
have a nice prudence in money During our brief stay we visited the
sights floating in the lake listening to pins drop in the gallery of
the Tabernacle seeing frescos of saints in robes speaking from heaven
to Joseph Smith in the Sunday clothes of a modern farmhand and in
the street we heard at a distance a strenuous domestic talk between the
newor perhaps I should say the originalhusband and wife

Shes corralled Sidneys cash said the delighted Lin He cant bet
nothing on this shower

And then after all this timeit didnt rain

Stripped of money both ways Cheyenne having most fortunately purchased
a return ticket sought its home The perplexed rainmaker went
somewhere else without his assistant Lusks exulting wife having the
money retained him with her

Good luck to yu Sidney said Lin speaking to him for the first time
since Cheyenne I feel a heap better since Ive saw yu married He
paid no attention to the biscuitshooter or the horrible language that
she threw after him

Jode also felt a heap better Legitimate science had triumphed
Today most of Cheyenne believes with Jode that it was all a
coincidence South Carolina had bet on her principles and won from Lin
the few dollars that I had lent the puncher

And what will you do now I said to Lin

Join the beef roundup Balaams payin forty dollars I guess thatll
keep a single man



A JOURNEY IN SEARCH OF CHRISTMAS

The Governor descended the steps of the Capitol slowly and with pauses
lifting a list frequently to his eye He had intermittently pencilled
it between stages of the forenoons public business and his gait grew
absent as he recurred now to his jottings in their accumulation with
a slight pain at their number and the definite fear that they would be
more in seasons to come They were the names of his friends children
to whom his excellent heart moved him to give Christmas presents He had
put off this regenerating evil until the latest day as was his custom
and now he was setting forth to do the whole thing at a blow entirely
planless among the guns and rockinghorses that would presently surround
him As he reached the highway he heard himself familiarly addressed
from a distance and turning saw four sons of the alkali jogging into
town from the plain One who had shouted to him galloped out from the
others rounded the Capitols enclosure and approaching with radiant
countenance leaned to reach the hand of the Governor and once again
greeted him with a hilarious Hello Doc

Governor Barker MD seeing Mr McLean unexpectedly after several
years hailed the horseman with frank and lively pleasure and
inquiring who might be the other riders behind was told that they were
Shorty Chalkeye and Dollar Bill come for Christmas And dandies to
hit town with Mr McLean added Redhot

I am acquainted with them assented his Excellency

Weve been ridin trail for twelve weeks the cowpuncher continued
makin our beds down anywheres and eatin the same old chuck every
day So weve shook fried beef and heifers delight and were goin to
feed high

Then Mr McLean overflowed with talk and pungent confidences for the
holidays already rioted in his spirit and his tongue was loosed over
their coming rites

Weve soured on scenery he finished in his drastic idiom Were
sick of moonlight and cowdung and were heeled for a big time

Call on me remarked the Governor cheerily when youre ready for
bromides and sulphates

I aint boxheaded no more protested Mr McLean Ive got maturity
Doc since I seen yu at the rainmaking and Im a heap older than them
hospital days when I bust my leg on yu Three or four glasses and quit
Thats my rule

That your rule too inquired the Governor of Shorty Chalkeye
and Dollar Bill These gentlemen of the saddle were sitting quite
expressionless upon their horses

We aint talkin were waitin observed Chalkeye and the three
cynics smiled amiably

Well Doc see yu again said Mr McLean He turned to accompany his
brother cowpunchers but in that particular moment Fate descended or
came up from whatever place she dwells in and entered the body of the
unsuspecting Governor

Whats your hurry said Fate speaking in the officials hearty
manner Come along with me

Cant do it Where are yu goin

Christmasing replied Fate

Well Ive got to feed my horse Christmasing yu say

Yes Im buying toys

Toys You What for

Oh some kids

Yourn screeched Lin precipitately

His Excellency the jovial Governor opened his teeth in pleasure at this
for he was a bachelor and there were fifteen upon his list which he
held up for the edification of the hasty McLean Not mine Im happy
to say My friends keep marrying and settling and their kids call me
uncle and climb around and bother and I forget their names and think
its a girl and the mother gets mad Why if I didnt remember these
little folks at Christmas theyd be wonderingnot the kids they just
break your toys and dont notice but the mother would wonderWhats
the matter with Dr Barker Has Governor Barker gone back on
usthats where the strain comes he broke off facing Mr McLean
with another spacious laugh

But the cowpuncher had ceased to smile and now while Barker ran
on exuberantly McLeans wideopen eyes rested upon him singular and
intent and in their hazel depths the last gleam of jocularity went out

Thats where the strain comes you see Two sets of acquaintances
Grateful patients and loyal voters and Ive got to keep solid with both
outfits especially the wives and mothers Theyre the people So its
drums and dolls and sheep on wheels and games and monkeys on a
stick and the saleslady shows you a mechanical bear and it costs too
much and you forget whether the Judges second girl is Nellie or Susie
andwell Im just in for my annual circus this afternoon Youre in
luck Christmas dont trouble a chap fixed like you

Lin McLean prolonged the sentence like a distant echo

A chap fixed like you The cowpuncher said it slowly to himself No
sure He seemed to be watching Shorty and Chalkeye and Dollar Bill
going down the road Thats a new ideaChristmas he murmured for it
was one of his oldest and he was recalling the Christmas when he wore
his first long trousers

Comes once a year pretty regular remarked the prosperous Governor
Seems often when you pay the bill

I havent made a Christmas gift pursued the cowpuncher dreamily
not forforLord its a hundred years I guess I dont know anybody
that has any right to look for such a thing from me This was indeed a
new idea and it did not stop the chill that was spreading in his heart

Gee whiz said Barker briskly there goes twelve oclock Ive got
to make a start Sorry you cant come and help me Goodbye

His Excellency left the rider sitting motionless and forgot him at once
in his own preoccupation He hastened upon his journey to the shops
with the list not in his pocket but held firmly like a plank in the
imminence of shipwreck The Nellies and Susies pervaded his mind and
he struggled with the presentiment that in a day or two he would recall
some omitted and wretchedly important child Quick hoofbeats made
him look up and Mr McLean passed like a wind The Governor absently
watched him go and saw the pony hunch and stiffen in the check of his
speed when Lin overtook his companions Down there in the distance they
took a side street and Barker rejoicingly remembered one more name and
wrote it as he walked In a few minutes he had come to the shops and
met face to face with Mr McLean

The boys are seein after my horse Lin rapidly began and Ive got
to meet em sharp at one Were twelve weeks shy on a square meal yu
see and this first has been a date from way back Id like to Here
Mr McLean cleared his throat and his speech went less smoothly Doc
Id like just for a while to watch yu gettinthem monkeys yu know

The Governor expressed his agreeable surprise at this change of mind
and was glad of McLeans company and judgment during the impending
selections A picture of a cowpuncher and himself discussing a
couple of dolls rose nimbly in Barkers mental eye and it was with an
imperfect honesty that he said Youll help me a heap

And Lin quite sincere replied Thank yu

So together these two went Christmasing in the throng Wyomings Chief
Executive knocked elbows with the spurred and jingling waif one man as
good as another in that raw hopeful fullblooded cattle era which now
the sobered West remembers as the days of its fond youth For one man
has been as good as another in three placesParadise before the Fall
the Rocky Mountains before the wire fence and the Declaration of
Independence And then this Governor beside being young almost as
young as Lin McLean or the Chief Justice who lately had celebrated his
thirtysecond birthday had in his doctoring days at Drybone known
the cowpuncher with that familiarity which lasts a lifetime without
breeding contempt accordingly he now laid a hand on Lins tall shoulder
and drew him among the petticoats and toys

Christmas filled the windows and Christmas stirred in mankind Cheyenne
not overzealous in doctrine or litanies and with the opinion that a
world in the hand is worth two in the bush nevertheless was flocking
together neighbor to think of neighbor and every one to remember the
children a sacred assembly after all gathered to rehearse unwittingly
the articles of its belief the Creed and Doctrine of the Child Lin
saw them hurry and smile among the paper fairies they questioned and
hesitated crowded and made decisions failed utterly to find the right
thing forgot and hastened back suffered all the various desperations
of the eleventh hour and turned homeward dropping their parcels with
that undimmed goodwill that once a year makes gracious the universal
human face This brotherhood swam and beamed before the cowpunchers
brooding eyes and in his ears the greeting of the season sang Children
escaped from their mothers and ran chirping behind the counters to touch
and meddle in places forbidden Friends dashed against each other with
rabbits and magic lanterns greeted in haste and were gone amid the
sound of musical boxes

Through this tinkle and bleating of little machinery the murmur of the
human heart drifted in and out of McLeans hearing fragments of home
talk tendernesses economies intimate first names and dinner hours
and whether it was joy or sadness it was in common the world seemed
knit in a single skein of home ties Two or three came by whose purses
must have been slender and whose purchases were humble and chosen after
much nice adjustment and when one plain man dropped a word about both
ends meeting and the woman with him laid a hand on his arm saying
that his children must not feel this year was different Lin made a
step toward them There were hours and spots where he could readily
have descended upon them at that played the role of clinking affluence
waved thanks aside with competent blasphemy and tossing off some
infamous whiskey cantered away in the full selfconscious strut of the
frontier But here was not the moment the abashed cowpuncher could
make no such parade in this place The people brushed by him back and
forth busy upon their errands and aware of him scarcely more than if
he had been a spirit looking on from the helpless dead and so while
these weaving needs and kindnesses of man were within arms touch of
him he was locked outside with his impulses Barker had in the natural
press of customers long parted from him to become immersed in choosing
and rejecting and now with a fair part of his mission accomplished
he was ready to go on to the next place and turned to beckon McLean
He found him obliterated in a corner beside a lifesized image of Santa
Claus standing as still as the frosty saint

He looks livelier than you do said the hearty Governor Fraid its
been slow waiting

No replied the cowpuncher thoughtfully No I guess not

This uncertainty was expressed with such gentleness that Barker roared
You never did lie to me he said long as Ive known you Well never
mind Ive got some real advice to ask you now

At this Mr McLeans face grew more alert Say Doc said he what do
yu want for Christmas that nobodys likely to give yu

A big practicebig enough to interfere with my politics

What else Things and truck I mean

Ohnothing Ill get People dont give things much to fellows like
me

Dont they Dont they

Why you and Santa Claus werent putting up any scheme on my stocking

Well

I believe youre in earnest cried his Excellency Thats simply
rich Here was a thing to relish The Frontier comes to town heeled
for a big time finds that presents are all the rage and must
immediately give somebody something Oh childlike miscellaneous
Frontier So thought the goodhearted Governor and it seems a venial
misconception My dear fellow he added meaning as well as possible
I dont want you to spend your money on me

Ive got plenty all right said Lin shortly

Plentys not the point Ill take as many drinks as you please with
you You didnt expect anything from me

That aintthat dont

There Of course you didnt Then what are you getting proud about
Heres our shop They stepped in from the street to new crowds and
counters Now pursued the Governor this is for a very particular
friend of mine Here they are Now which of those do you like best

They were sets of Tennyson in cases holding little volumes equal in
number but the binding various and Mr McLean reached his decision
after one look That said he and laid a large muscular hand upon the
Laureate The young lady behind the counter spoke out acidly and Lin
pulled the abject hand away His taste however happened to be sound
or at least it was at one with the Governors but now they learned
that there was a distressing variance in the matter of price

The Governor stared at the delicate article of his choice I know
that Tennyson is what sheis whats wanted he muttered and feeling
himself nudged looked around and saw Lins extended fist This gesture
he took for a facetious sympathy and dolorously grasping the hand
found himself holding a lump of bills Sheer amazement relaxed him and
the cowpunchers matted wealth tumbled on the floor in sight of all
people Barker picked it up and gave it back No no no he said
mirthful over his own inclination to be annoyed you cant do that Im
just as much obliged Lin he added

Just as a loan Docsome of it Im grassbellied with spotcash

A giggle behind the counter disturbed them both but the sharp
young lady was only dusting The Governor at once paid haughtily
for Tennysons expensive works and the cowpuncher pushed his
discountenanced savings back into his clothes Making haste to leave
the book department of this shop they regained a mutual ease and
the Governor became waggish over Lins concern at being too rich He
suggested to him the list of delinquent taxpayers and the latest census
from which to select indigent persons He had patients too whose
inveterate pennilessness he could swear cheerfully tosince you want
to bolt from your own money he remarked

Yes Im a green horse assented Mr McLean gallantly aint used to
the looks of a twentydollar bill and I shy at em

From his facethat jocular maskone might have counted him the most
serene and careless of vagrants and in his words only the ordinary
voice of banter spoke to the Governor A good woman it may well be
would have guessed before this the sensitive soul in the blundering
body but Barker saw just the familiar whimsical happygolucky McLean
of old days and so he went gayly and innocently on treading upon holy
ground Ive got it he exclaimed give your wife something

The ruddy cowpuncher grinned He had passed through the world of woman
with but few delays rejoicing in informal and transient entanglements
and he welcomed the turn which the conversation seemed now to be taking
If youll give me her name and address said he with the future
entirely in his mind

Why Laramie and the Governor feigned surprise

Say Doc said Lin uneasily none of em aint married me since I
saw yu last

Then she hasnt written from Laramie said the hilarious Governor and
Mr McLean understood and winced in his spirit deep down Gee whiz
went on Barker Ill never forget you and Lusk that day

But the mask fell now Youre talking of his wife not mine said the
cowpuncher very quietly and smiling no more and Doc Im going to
say a word to yu for I know yuve always been my good friend Ill
never forget that day myselfbut I dont want to be reminded of it

Im a fool Lin said the Governor generous instantly I never
supposed

I know yu didnt Doc It aint you thats the fool And in a wayin
a way Lins speech ended among his crowding memories and Barker
seeing how wistful his face had turned waited But I aint quite the
same fool I was before that happened to me the cowpuncher resumed
though maybe my actions dont show to be wiser I know that there was
better luck than a man like me had any call to look for

The sobered Barker said simply Yes Lin He was put to thinking by
these words from the unsuspected inner man

Out in the Bow Leg country Lin McLean had met a woman with thick
red cheeks calling herself by a maiden name and this was his whole
knowledge of her when he put her one morning astride a Mexican saddle
and took her fifty miles to a magistrate and made her his lawful wife
to the best of his ability and belief His sagebrush intimates were
confident he would never have done it but for a rival Racing the rival
and beating him had swept Mr McLean past his own intentions and the
marriage was an inadvertence He jest bumped into it before he could
pull up they explained and this casualty resulting from Mr McLeans
sporting blood had entertained several hundred square miles of alkali
For the newmade husband the joke soon died In the immediate weeks that
came upon him he tasted a bitterness worse than in all his life before
and learned also how deep the woman when once she begins can sink
beneath the man in baseness That was a knowledge of which he had lived
innocent until this time But he carried his outward self serenely so
that citizens in Cheyenne who saw the cowpuncher with his bride argued
shrewdly that men of that sort liked women of that sort and before the
strain had broken his endurance an unexpected first husband named
Lusk had appeared one Sunday in the street prosperous forgiving
and exceedingly drunk To the arms of Lusk she went back in the public
street deserting McLean in the presence of Cheyenne and when Cheyenne
saw this and learned how she had been Mrs Lusk for eight long if
intermittent years Cheyenne laughed loudly Lin McLean laughed too
and went about his business ready to swagger at the necessary moment
and with the necessary kind of joke always ready to shield his hurt
spirit And soon of course the matter grew stale seldom raked up in
the Bow Leg country where Lin had been at work so lately he had begun
to remember other things beside the smouldering humiliation

Is she with him he asked Barker and musingly listened while Barker
told him The Governor had thought to make it a racy story with the
moral that the joke was now on Lusk but that inner man had spoken and
revealed the cowpuncher to him in a new and complicated light hence he
quieted the proposed lively cadence and vocabulary of his anecdote
about the house of Lusk but instead of narrating how Mrs beat Mr on
Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays and Mr took his turn the odd days
thus getting one ahead of his lady while the kid Lusk had outlined
his opinion of the family by recently skipping to parts unknown Barker
detailed these incidents more gravely adding that Laramie believed Mrs
Lusk addicted to opium

I dont guess Ill leave my card on em said McLean grimly if I
strike Laramie

You dont mind my saying I think youre well out of that scrape
Barker ventured

Shucks no Thats all right Doc Onlyyu see now A man gets tired
pretendingonced in a while

Time had gone while they were in talk and it was now half after one and
Mr McLean late for that longplotted first square meal So the friends
shook hands wishing each other Merry Christmas and the cowpuncher
hastened toward his chosen companions through the stirring cheerfulness
of the season His playhour had made a dull beginning among the toys
He had come upon people engaged in a pleasant game and waited shy and
well disposed for some bidding to join but they had gone on playing
with each other and left him out And now he went along in a sort of
hurry to escape from that loneliness where his human promptings had been
lodged with him useless Here was Cheyenne full of holiday for sale
and he with his pockets full of money to buy and when he thought of
Shorty and Chalkeye and Dollar Bill those dandies to hit a town with
he stepped out with a brisk false hope It was with a mental hurrah and
a foretaste of a good time coming that he put on his town clothes after
shaving and admiring himself and sat down to the square meal He ate
away and drank with a robust imitation of enjoyment that took in even
himself at first But the sorrowful process of his spirit went on for
all he could do As he groped for the contentment which he saw around
him he began to receive the jokes with counterfeit mirth Memories took
the place of anticipation and through their moody shiftings he began
to feel a distaste for the company of his friends and a shrinking from
their lively voices He blamed them for this at once He was surprised
to think he had never recognized before how light a weight was Shorty
and here was Chalkeye who knew better talking religion after two
glasses Presently this attack of noticing his friends shortcomings
mastered him and his mind according to its wont changed at a stroke
Im celebrating no Christmas with this crowd said the inner man and
when they had next remembered Lin McLean in their hilarity he was gone

Governor Barker finishing his purchases at halfpast three went to
meet a friend come from Evanston Mr McLean was at the railway station
buying a ticket for Denver

Denver exclaimed the amazed Governor

Thats what I said stated Mr McLean doggedly

Gee whiz went his Excellency What are you going to do there

Get good and drunk

Cant you find enough whiskey in Cheyenne

Im drinking champagne this trip

The cowpuncher went out on the platform and got aboard and the train
moved off Barker had walked out too in his surprise and as he stared
after the last car Mr McLean waved his wide hat defiantly and went
inside the door

And he says hes got maturity Barker muttered Ive known him since
seventynine and hes kept about eight years old right along The
Governor was cross and sorry and presently crosser His jokes about
Lins marriage came back to him and put him in a rage with the departed
fool Yes about eight Or six said his Excellency justifying
himself by the past For he had first known Lin the boy of nineteen
supreme in length of limb and recklessness breaking horses and feeling
for an early mustache Next when the mustache was nearly accomplished
he had mended the boys badly broken thigh at Drybone His skill and
Lins utter health had wrought so swift a healing that the surgeon
overflowed with the pride of science and over the bandages would
explain the human body technically to his wildeyed and flattered
patient Thus young Lin heard all about tibia and comminuted and other
glorious new words and when sleepless would rehearse them Then
with the bone so nearly knit that the patient might leave the ward
on crutches to sit each morning in Barkers room as a privilege the
disobedient child of twentyone had slipped out of the hospital and
hobbled hastily to the hog ranch where whiskey and variety waited for
a languishing convalescent Here he grew gay and was soon carried back
with the leg refractured Yet Barkers surgical rage was disarmed the
patient was so forlorn over his doctors professional chagrin

I suppose it aint no better this morning Doc he had said humbly
after a new week of bed and weights

Your right legs going to be shorter Thats all

Oh gosh Ive been and spoiled your comminuted feemur Aint I a
sonofagun

You could not chide such a boy as this and in times due course he had
walked jauntily out into the world with legs of equal length after all
and in his stride the slightest halt possible And Doctor Barker had
missed the childs conversation Today his mustache was a perfected
thing and he in the late end of his twenties

Hell wake up about noon tomorrow in a dive without a cent said
Barker Then hell come back on a freight and begin over again

At the Denver station Lin McLean passed through the shoutings and
omnibuses and came to the beginning of Seventeenth Street where is the
first saloon A customer was ordering Hot Scotch and because he liked
the smell and had not thought of the mixture for a number of years Lin
took Hot Scotch Coming out upon the pavement he looked across and saw
a saloon opposite with brighter globes and windows more prosperous That
should have been his choice lemon peel would undoubtedly be fresher
over there and over he went at once to begin the whole thing properly
In such frozen weather no drink could be more timely and he sat to
enjoy without haste its mellow fitness Once again on the pavement he
looked along the street toward uptown beneath the crisp cold electric
lights and three little bootblacks gathered where he stood and cried
Shine Shine at him Remembering that you took the third turn to the
right to get the best dinner in Denver Lin hit on the skilful plan of
stopping at all Hot Scotches between but the next occurred within a
few yards and it was across the street This one being attained and
appreciated he found that he must cross back again or skip number four
At this rate he would not be dining in time to see much of the theatre
and he stopped to consider It was a German place he had just
quitted and a huge light poured out on him from its window which the
proprietors fatherland sentiment had made into a show Lights shone
among a wellset pine forest where beery jovial gnomes sat on roots
and reached upward to Santa Claus he grinning fat and Teutonic held
in his right hand forever a foaming glass and forever in his left a
string of sausages that dangled down among the gnomes With his American
back to this the cowpuncher wearing the same serious absent face he
had not changed since he ran away from himself at Cheyenne considered
carefully the Hot Scotch question and which side of the road to take
and stick to while the little bootblacks found him once more and cried
Shine Shine monotonous as snowbirds He settled to stay over here
with the southside Scotches and the little onenote song reaching his
attention he suddenly shoved his foot at the nearest boy who lightly
sprang away

Dare you to touch him piped a snowbird dangerously They were in
short trousers and the eldest enemy it may be was ten

Dont hit me said Mr McLean Im innocent

Well you leave him be said one

Whats he layin to kick you for Billy Taint yer pop is it

New said Billy in scorn Father never kicked me Dont know who he
is

Hes a special shrilled the leading bird sensationally Hes got a
badge and hes goin to arrest yer

Two of them hopped instantly to the safe middle of the street and
scattered with practiced strategy but Billy stood his ground Dare you
to arrest me said he

Whatll you give me not to inquired Lin and he put his hands in his
pockets arms akimbo

Nothing Ive done nothing announced Billy firmly But even in the
last syllable his voice suddenly failed a terror filled his eyes and
he too sped into the middle of the street

Whats he claim you lifted inquired the leader with eagerness
Tell him you havent been inside a store today We can prove it they
screamed to the special officer

Say said the slowspoken Lin from the pavement youre poor judges
of a badge you fellows

His tone pleased them where they stood wide apart from each other

Mr McLean also remained stationary in the bluish illumination of the
window Why if any policeman was caught wearin this here said he
following his sprightly invention hed get arrested himself

This struck them extremely They began to draw together Billy lingering
the last

If its your idea pursued Mr McLean alluringly as the three took
cautious steps nearer the curb that blue clasped hands in a circle of
red stars gives the bearer the right to put folks in the jugwhy Ill
get somebody else to black my boots for a dollar

The three made a swift rush fell on simultaneous knees and clattering
their boxes down began to spit in an industrious circle

Easy wheedled Mr McLean and they looked up at him staring and
fascinated Not having three feet said the cowpuncher always grave
and slow I can only give two this here job

Hes got a big pistol and a belt exulted the leader who had
precociously felt beneath Lins coat

Youre a smart boy said Lin considering him and yu find a man out
right away Now you stand off and tell me all about myself while they
fix the bootsand a dollar goes to the quickest through

Young Billy and his towheaded competitor flattened down each to a
boot with all their might while the leader ruefully contemplated Mr
McLean

Thats a Colt45 youve got ventured he

Right again Some day maybe youll be wearing one of your own if the
angels dont pull yu before youre ripe

Im through sang out Towhead rising in haste

Small Billy was struggling still but leaped at that the two heads
bobbing to a level together and Mr McLean looking down saw that the
arrangement had not been a good one for the boots

Will you kindly referee said he forgivingly to the leader and
decide which of them smears is the awfulest

But the leader looked the other way and played upon a mouthorgan

Well that saves me money said Mr McLean jingling his pocket
I guess youve both won He handed each of them a dollar Now he
continued I just dassent show these boots uptown so this time its a
dollar for the best shine

The two went palpitating at their brushes again and the leader played
his mouthorgan with brilliant unconcern Lin tall and brooding leaned
against the jutting sill of the window a figure somehow plainly strange
in town while through the bright plateglass Santa Claus holding out
his beer and sausages perpetually beamed

Billy was laboring gallantly but it was labor the cowpuncher
perceived and Billy no seasoned expert See here said Lin stooping
Ill show yu how its done Hes playin that toon crosseyed enough
to steer anybody crooked There Keep your blacking soft and work with
a dry brush

Lemme said Billy Ive got to learn So he finished the boot his
own way with wiry determination breathing and repolishing and this
event was also adjudged a dead heat with results gratifying to both
parties So here was their work done and more money in their pockets
than from all the other boots and shoes of this day and Towhead and
Billy did not wish for further trade but to spend this handsome fortune
as soon as might be Yet they delayed in the brightness of the window
drawn by curiosity near this new kind of man whose voice held them and
whose remarks dropped them into constant uncertainty Even the omitted
leader had been unable to go away and nurse his pride alone

Is that a secret society inquired Towhead lifting a finger at the
badge

Mr McLean nodded Turruble said he

Youre a Wells  Fargo detective asserted the leader

Play your harp said Lin

Are you aa desperaydo whispered Towhead

Oh my observed Mr McLean sadly what has our Jack been readin

Hes a cattleman cried Billy I seen his heels

Thats you said the discovered puncher with approval Youll do
But I bet you cant tell me what we wearers of this badge have sworn to
do this night

At this they craned their necks and glared at him

Wearesworndont yu jump now and give me awaysworntoblow
off three bootblacks to a dinner

Ah pshaw They backed away bristling with distrust

Thats the oath fellows Yu may as well make your minds upfor I
have it to do

Dare you to Ah

And after dinner its the Operahouse to see The Children of Captain
Cant

They screamed shrilly at him keeping off beyond the curb

I cant waste my time on such smart boys said Mr McLean rising
lazily to his full height from the windowsill I am goin somewhere to
find boys that aint so turruble quick stampeded by a roast turkey

He began to lounge slowly away serious as he had been throughout and
they stopping their noise short swiftly picked up their boxes and
followed him Some change in the current of electricity that fed the
window disturbed its sparkling light so that Santa Claus with his arms
stretched out behind the departing cowpuncher seemed to be smiling more
broadly from the midst of his flickering brilliance

On their way to turkey the host and his guests exchanged but few
remarks He was full of goodwill and threw off a comment or two that
would have led to conversation under almost any circumstances save
these but the minds of the guests were too distracted by this whole
state of things for them to be capable of more than keeping after Mr
McLean in silence at a wary interval and with their mouths during
most of the journey open The badge the pistol their patrons talk
and the unusual dollars wakened wide their bent for the unexpected
their street affinity for the spur of the moment they believed slimly
in the turkey part of it but what this man might do next to be
there when he did it and not to be trapped kept their wits jumping
deliciously so when they saw him stop they stopped instantly too ten
feet out of reach This was Denvers most civilized restaurantthat one
which Mr McLean had remembered with foreign dishes and private rooms
where he had promised himself among other things champagne Mr McLean
had never been inside it but heard a tale from a friend and now he
caught a sudden sight of people among geraniums with plumes and white
shirtfronts very elegant It must have been several minutes that he
stood contemplating the entrance and the luxurious couples who went in

Plumb French he observed at length and then Shucks in a key less
confident while his guests ten feet away watched him narrowly Theyre
eatin patty de parleyvoo in there he muttered and the three
bootblacks came beside him Say fellows said Lin confidingly I
wasnt raised good enough for them dude dishes What do yu say Im
after a place where yu can mention oyster stoo without givin anybody a
fit What do yu say boys

That lighted the divine spark of brotherhood

Ah you come along with uswell take yer You dont want to go in
there Well show yer the boss place in Market Street We wont lose
yer So shouting together in their shrill little city trebles they
clustered about him and one pulled at his coat to start him He started
obediently and walked in their charge they leading the way

Christmas is comin now sure said Lin grinning to himself It
aint exactly what I figured on It was the first time he had laughed
since Cheyenne and he brushed a hand over his eyes that were dim with
the new warmth in his heart

Believing at length in him and his turkey the alert street faces so
suspicious of the unknown looked at him with ready intimacy as they
went along and soon in the friendly desire to make him acquainted with
Denver the three were patronizing him Only Billy perhaps now and
then stole at him a doubtful look

The large Country Mouse listened solemnly to his three Town Mice who
presently introduced him to the place in Market Street It was not boss
precisely and Denver knows better neighborhoods but the turkey and
the oyster stew were there with catsup and vegetables in season and
several choices of pie Here the Country Mouse became again efficient
and to witness his liberal mastery of ordering and imagine his pocket
and its wealth which they had heard and partly seen renewed in the
guests a transient awe As they dined however and found the host as
frankly ravenous as themselves this reticence evaporated and they all
grew fluent with oaths and opinions At one or two words indeed Mr
McLean stared and had a slight sense of blushing

Have a cigarette said the leader over his pie

Thank yu said Lin I wont smoke if yull excuse me He had
devised a wholesome meal with water to drink

Chewins no good at meals continued the boy Dont you use
tobaccer

Onced in a while

The leader spat brightly He aint learned yet said he slanting his
elbows at Billy and sliding a match over his rump But beer nowI
never seen anything in it He and Towhead soon left Billy and his
callow profanities behind and engaged in a town conversation that
silenced him and set him listening with all his admiring young might
Nor did Mr McLean join in the talk but sat embarrassed by this
knowledge which seemed about as much as he knew himself

Ill be goshed he thought if Id caught on to half that when I was
streakin around in short pants Maybe they grow up quicker now
But now the Country Mouse perceived Billys eager and attentive
apprenticeship Hello boys he said that theatres got a big start
on us

They had all forgotten he had said anything about theatre and other
topics left their impatient minds while the Country Mouse paid the bill
and asked to be guided to the Operahouse This man here will look out
for your blackin and truck and let yu have it in the morning

They were very late The spectacle had advanced far into passages of
the highest thrill and Denvers eyes were riveted upon a ship and some
icebergs The party found its seats during several beautiful limelight
effects and that remarkable flybuzzing of violins which is pronounced
so helpful in times of peril and sentiment The children of Captain
Grant had been tracking their father all over the equator and other
scenic spots and now the north pole was about to impale them The
Captains youngest child perceiving a hummock rushing at them with a
sudden motion loudly shouted Sister the ice is closing in and she
replied chastely Then let us pray It was a superb tableau the ice
split and the sun rose and joggled at once to the zenith The actdrop
fell and male Denver wrung to its religious deeps went out to the
rumshop

Of course Mr McLean and his party did not do this The party had
applauded exceedingly the defeat of the elements and the leader with
Towhead discussed the probable chances of the ships getting farther
south in the next act Until lately Billys doubt of the cowpuncher had
lingered but during this intermission whatever had been holding out
in him seemed won and in his eyes that he turned stealthily upon his
unconscious quiet neighbor shone the beginnings of heroworship

Dont you think this is splendid said he

Splendid Lin replied a trifle remotely

Dont you like it when they all get balled up and get out that way

Humming said Lin

Dont you guess its just girls though that do that

What young fellow

Why all that prayersaying an stuff

I guess it must be

She said to do it when the ice scared her an of course a man had to
do what she wanted him

Sure

Well do you believe theyd a done it if she hadnt been on that
boat and clung around an cried an everything an made her friends
feel bad

I hardly expect they would replied the honest Lin and then suddenly
mindful of Billy except there wasnt nothin else they could think
of he added wishing to speak favorably of the custom

Why that chunk of ice werent so awful big anyhow Id a shoved her
off with a pole Wouldnt you

Butted her like a ram exclaimed Mr McLean

Well I dont say my prayers any more I told Mr Perkins I wasnt
agoing to an heI think he is a flubdub anyway

Ill bet he is said Lin sympathetically He was scarcely a prudent
guardian

I told him straight an he looked at me an down he flops on his
knees An he made em all flop but I told him I didnt care for them
putting up any campmeeting over me an he says Ill lick you an
I says Dare you to I told him mother kep alicking me for nothing
an Id not pray for her not in Sundayschool or anywheres else Do you
pray much

No replied Lin uneasily

There I told him a man didnt an he said then a man went to hell
You lie father aint going to hell I says and youd ought to heard
the first class laugh right out loud girls an boys An he was that
mad But I didnt care I came here with fifty cents

Yu must have felt like a millionaire

Ah I felt all right I bought papers an sold em an got more an
saved ant got my box an blacking outfit I werent going to be licked
by her just because she felt like it an she feeling like it most any
time Lemme see your pistol

You wait said Lin After this show is through Ill put it on you

Will you honest Belt an everything Did you ever shoot a bear

Lord lots

Honest Silvertips

Silvertips cinnamon black and I roped a cub onced

Oh I never shot a bear

Youd ought to try it

Im agoing to Im agoing to camp out in the mountains Id like to
see you when you camp Id like to camp with you Mightnt I some time
Billy had drawn nearer to Lin and was looking up at him adoringly

You bet said Lin and though he did not perhaps entirely mean this
it was with a curiously softened face that he began to look at Billy
As with dogs and his horse so always he played with what children he
metthe few in his sagebrush world but this was ceasing to be quite
play for him and his hand went to the boys shoulder

Father took me camping with him once the time mother was off Father
gets awful drunk too Ive quit Laramie for good

Lin sat up and his hand gripped the boy Laramie said he almost
shouting it Yuyuis your name Lusk

But the boy had shrunk from him instantly Youre not going to take me
home he piteously wailed

Heaven and heavens murmured Lin McLean So youre her kid

He relaxed again down in his chair his legs stretched their straight
length below the chair in front He was waked from his bewilderment by
a brushing under him and there was young Billy diving for escape to the
aisle like the cornered city mouse that he was Lin nipped that poor
little attempt and had the limp Billy seated inside again before the two
in discussion beyond had seen anything He had said not a word to the
boy and now watched his unhappy eyes seizing upon the various exits and
dispositions of the theatre nor could he imagine anything to tell him
that should restore the perished confidence Why did yu lead him off
he asked himself unexpectedly and found that he did not seem to know
but as he watched the restless and estranged runaway he grew more and
more sorrowful I just hate him to think that of me he reflected
The curtain rose and he saw Billy make up his mind to wait until they
should all be going out in the crowd While the children of Captain
Grant grew hotter and hotter upon their fathers geographic trail Lin
sat saying to himself a number of contradictions Hes nothing to
me whats any of them to me Driven to bay by his bewilderment he
restated the facts of the past Why shed deserted him and Lusk before
shed ever laid eyes on me I neednt to bother myself He wasnt never
even my stepkid The past however brought no guidance Lord whats
the thing to do about this If I had any homeThis is a stinkin world
in some respects said Mr McLean aloud unknowingly The lady in the
chair beneath which the cowpuncher had his legs nudged her husband
They took it for emotion over the sad fortune of Captain Grant and
their backs shook Presently each turned and saw the singular man with
untamed wideopen eyes glowering at the stage and both backs shook
again

Once more his hand was laid on Billy Say The boy glanced at him and
quickly away

Look at me and listen

Billy swervingly obeyed

I aint after yu and never was This heres your business not mine
Are yu listenin good

The boy made a nod and Lin proceeded whispering Youve got no call
to believe what I say to yuyuve been lied to I guess pretty often
So Ill not stop yu runnin and hidin and Ill never give it away I
saw yu but yu keep doin what yu please Ill just go now Ive saw
all I want but you and your friends stay with it till it quits If
yu happen to wish to speak to me about that pistol or bears yu come
around to Smiths Palacethats the boss hotel here aint itand if
yu dont come too late Ill not be gone to bed But this time of night
Im liable to get sleepy Tell your friends goodbye for me and be good
to yourself Ive appreciated your company

Mr McLean entered Smiths Palace and engaging a room with two beds
in it did a little delicate lying by means of the truth Its a lost
boya runaway he told the clerk Hell not be extra clean I expect
if he does come Maybe hell give me the slip and Ill have a job cut
out tomorrow Ill thank yu to put my money in your safe

The clerk placed himself at the disposal of the secret service and Lin
walked up and down looking at the railroad photographs for some ten
minutes when Master Billy peered in from the street

Hello said Mr McLean casually and returned to a fine picture of
Pikes Peak

Billy observed him for a space and receiving no further attention
came stepping along Im not agoing back to Laramie he stated
warningly

I wouldnt said Lin It aint half the town Denver is Well
goodnight Sorry yu couldnt call soonerIm dead sleepy

Oh Billy stood blank I wish Id shook the darned old show Say
lemme black your boots in the morning

Not sure my train dont go too early

Im up Im up I get around to all of em

Where do yu sleep

Sleeping with the engineman now Why cant you put that on me
tonight

Goin upstairs This gentleman wouldnt let you go upstairs

But the earnestly petitioned clerk consented and Billy was the first
to hasten into the room He stood rapturous while Lin buckled the
belt round his scanty stomach and ingeniously buttoned the suspenders
outside the accoutrement to retard its immediate descent to earth

Did it ever kill a man asked Billy touching the sixshooter

No It aint never had to do that but I expect maybe its stopped some
killin me

Oh leave me wear it just a minute Do you collect arrowheads I think
theyre bully Theres the finest one you ever seen He brought out
the relic tightly wrapped in paper several pieces I foun it myself
camping with father It was sticking in a crack right on top of a rock
but nobodyd seen it till I came along Aint it fine

Mr McLean pronounced it a gem

Father an me found a lot an they made mother mad laying around an
she throwed em out She takes stuff from Kelleys

Whos Kelley

He keeps the drugstore at Laramie Mother gets awful funny Thats
how she was when I came home For I told Mr Perkins he lied an I ran
then An I knowed well enough shed lick me when she got through her
spellan father cant stop her an Iah I was sick of it Shes
lamed me up twice beating mean Perkins wanting me to say God bless
my mother agetting up and agoing to bedhes a flubdub An so I
cleared out But Id just as leaves said for God to bless fatheran
you Ill do it now if you say its any sense

Mr McLean sat down in a chair Dont yu do it now said he

You wouldnt like mother Billy continued You can keep that He
came to Lin and placed the arrowhead in his hands standing beside
him Do you like birds eggs I collect them I got twentyfive
kindssagehen an blue grouse an willowgrouse an lots more
kinds harderbut I couldnt bring all them from Laramie I brought
the magpies though D you care to see a magpie egg Well you
stay tomorrow an Ill show you that en some other things I got the
engineman lets me keep there for theres boys that would steal an egg
An I could take you where we could fire that pistol Bet you dont know
what that is

He brought out a small tin box shaped like a thimble in which were
things that rattled

Mr McLean gave it up

Thats kinnikinnic seed You can have that for I got some more with
the engineman

Lin received this second token also and thanked the giver for it His
first feeling had been to prevent the boys parting with his treasures
but something that came not from the polish of manners and experience
made him know that he should take them Billy talked away laying bare
his little soul the street boy that was not quite come made place for
the child that was not quite gone and unimportant words and confidences
dropped from him disjointed as he climbed to the knee of Mr McLean and
inadvertently took that cowpuncher for some sort of parent he had not
hitherto met It lasted but a short while however for he went to sleep
in the middle of a sentence with his head upon Lins breast The man
held him perfectly still because he had not the faintest notion
that Billy would be impossible to disturb At length he spoke to him
suggesting that bed might prove more comfortable and finding how it
was rose and undressed the boy and laid him between the sheets The
arms and legs seemed aware of the moves required of them and stirred
conveniently and directly the head was upon the pillow the whole small
frame burrowed down without the opening of an eye or a change in the
breathing Lin stood some time by the bedside with his eyes on the
long curling lashes and the curly hair Then he glanced craftily at the
door of the room and at himself in the lookingglass He stooped and
kissed Billy on the forehead and rising from that gave himself a
hangdog stare in the mirror and soon in his own bed was sleeping the
sound sleep of health

He was faintly roused by the church bells and lay still lingering
with his sleep his eyes closed and his thoughts unshaped As he became
slowly aware of the morning the ringing and the light reached him and
he waked wholly and still lying quiet considered the strange room
filled with the bells and the sun of the winters day Where have I
struck now he inquired and as last night returned abruptly upon his
mind he raised himself on his arm

There sat Responsibility in a chair washed clean and dressed watching
him

Youre awful late said Responsibility But I werent agoing without
telling you goodbye

Go exclaimed Lin Go where Yu surely aint leavin me to eat
breakfast alone The cowpuncher made his voice very plaintive Set
Responsibility free after all his trouble to catch him This was more
than he could do

Ive got to go If Id thought youd want for me to staywhy you said
you was agoing by the early train

But the durned things got away on me said Lin smiling sweetly from
the bed

If I hadnt apromised them

Who

Sidney Ellis and Pete Goode Why you know them you grubbed with
them

Shucks

Were agoing to have fun today

Oh

For its Christmas an weve bought some good cigars an Pete says
hell learn me sure O course Ive smoked some you know But Id just
as leaves stayed with you if Id only knowed sooner I wish you lived
here Did you smoke whole big cigars when you was beginning

Do you like flapjacks and maple syrup inquired the artful McLean
Thats what Im figuring on inside twenty minutes

Twenty minutes If theyd wait

See here Bill Theyve quit expecting yu dont yu think Id ought
to waked yu see but I slep and slep and kep yu from meetin your
engagements yu seefor you couldnt go of course A man couldnt
treat a man that way now could he

Course he couldnt said Billy brightening

And they wouldnt wait yu see They wouldnt fool away Christmas
that only comes onced a year kickin their heels and sayin Wheres
Billy Theyd say Bill has sure made other arrangements which hell
explain to us at his leesyure And theyd skip with the cigars

The advocate paused effectively and from his bolster regarded Billy
with a convincing eye

Thats so said Billy

And where would yu be then Bill In the street out of friends out
of Christmas and left both ways no tobaccer and no flapjacks Now
Bill what do yu say to us putting up a Christmas deal together Just
you and me

Id like that said Billy Is it all day

I was thinkin of all day said Lin Ill not make yu do anything
yud rather not

Ah they can smoke without me said Billy with sudden acrimony Ill
see em tomorro

Thats you cried Mr McLean Now Bill you hustle down and tell
them to keep a table for us Ill get my clothes on and follow yu

The boy went and Mr McLean procured hot water and dressed himself
tying his scarf with great care Wished Id a clean shirt said he
But I dont look very bad Shavin yesterday afternoon was a good
move He picked up the arrowhead and the kinnikinnic and was
particular to store them in his safest pocket I aint sure whether
youre crazy or not said he to the man in the lookingglass I aint
never been sure And he slammed the door and went downstairs

He found young Bill on guard over a table for four with all the chairs
tilted against it as warning to strangers No one sat at any other table
or came into the room for it was late and the place quite emptied of
breakfasters and the several entertained waiters had gathered behind
Billys importantlooking back Lin provided a thorough meal and Billy
pronounced the flannel cakes superior to flapjacks which were not upon
the bill of fare

Id like to see you often said he Ill come and see you if you
dont live too far

Thats the trouble said the cowpuncher I do Awful far He stared
out of the window

Well I might come some time I wish youd write me a letter Can you
write Whats that Can I write Oh yes

I can write an I can read too Ive been to school in Sidney
Nebraska an Magaw Kansas an Salt Lakethats the finest town
except Denver

Billy fell into that cheerful strain of comment which unreplied to
yet goes on contented and selfsustaining while Mr McLean gave amiable
signs of assent but chiefly looked out of the window and when the now
interested waiter said respectfully that he desired to close the room
they went out to the office where the money was got out of the safe and
the bill paid

The streets were full of the bright sun and seemingly at Denvers gates
stood the mountains sparkling an air crisp and pleasant wafted from
their peaks no smoke hung among the roofs and the sky spread wide over
the city without a stain it was holiday up among the chimneys and tall
buildings and down among the quiet groundstories below as well and
presently from their scattered pinnacles through the town the bells
broke out against the jocund silence of the morning

Dont you like music inquired Billy

Yes said Lin

Ladies with their husbands and children were passing and meeting
orderly yet gayer than if it were only Sunday and the salutations of
Christmas came now and again to the cowpunchers ears but today
possessor of his own share in this Lin looked at every one with a sort
of friendly challenge and young Billy talked along beside him

Dont you think we could go in here Billy asked A church door was
open and the rich organ sounded through to the pavement Theyve good
music here an they keep it up without much talking between Ive been
in lots of times

They went in and sat to hear the music Better than the organ it seemed
to them were the harmonious voices raised from somewhere outside like
unexpected visitants and the pair sat in their back seat too deep
in listening to the processional hymn to think of rising in decent
imitation of those around them The crystal melody of the refrain
especially reached their understandings and when for the fourth time
Shout the glad tidings exultingly sing pealed forth and ceased both
the delighted faces fell

Dont you wish there was more Billy whispered

Wish there was a hundred verses answered Lin

But canticles and responses followed with so little talking between
them they were held spellbound seldom thinking to rise or kneel
Lins eyes roved over the church dwelling upon the pillars in their
evergreen the flowers and leafy wreaths the texts of white and
gold Peace goodwill towards men he read Thats so Peace and
goodwill Yes thats so I expect they got that somewheres in the
Bible Its awful good and youd never think of it yourself

There was a touch on his arm and a woman handed a book to him This is
the hymn we have now she whispered gently and Lin blushing scarlet
took it passively without a word He and Billy stood up and held the
book together dutifully reading the words

 It came upon the midnight clear
 That glorious song of old
 From angels bending near the earth
 To touch their harps of gold
 Peace on the earth

This tune was more beautiful than all and Lin lost himself in it
until he found Billy recalling him with a finger upon the words the
concluding ones

 And the whole world sent back the song
 Which now the angels sing

The music rose and descended to its lovely and simple end and for a
second time in Denver Lin brushed a hand across his eyes He turned
his face from his neighbor frowning crossly and since the heart has
reasons which Reason does not know he seemed to himself a fool but
when the service was over and he came out he repeated again Peace
and goodwill When I run on to the Bishop of Wyoming Ill tell him if
hell preach on them words Ill be there

Couldnt we shoot your pistol now asked Billy

Sure boy Aint yu hungry though

No I wish we were away off up there Dont you

The mountains They look pretty so white A heap better n houses
Why well go there Theres trains to Golden Well shoot around among
the foothills

To Golden they immediately went and after a meal there wandered in the
open country until the cartridges were gone the sun was low and Billy
was walked off his young heelsa truth he learned complete in one
horrid moment and battled to conceal

Lame he echoed angrily I aint

Shucks said Lin after the next ten steps You are and both feet

Tell you theres stones here an Im just askipping them

Lin briefly took the boy in his arms and carried him to Golden
Im played out myself he said sitting in the hotel and looking
lugubriously at Billy on a bed And I aint fit to have charge of a
hog He came and put his hand on the boys head

Im not sick said the cripple I tell you Im bully You wait an
see me eat dinner

But Lin had hot water and cold water and salt and was an hour upon his
knees bathing the hot feet And then Billy could not eat dinner

There was a doctor in Golden but in spite of his light prescription
and most reasonable observations Mr McLean passed a foolish night of
vigil while Billy slept quite well at first and as the hours passed
better and better In the morning he was entirely brisk though stiff

I couldnt work quick today he said But I guess one day wont lose
me my trade

How d yu mean asked Lin

Why Ive got regulars you know Sidney Ellis an Pete Goode has
theirs an we dont cut each other Ive got Mr Daniels an Mr Fisher
an lots an if you lived in Denver Id shine your boots every day for
nothing I wished you lived in Denver

Shine my boots Yull never And yu dont black Daniels or Fisher or
any of the outfit

Why Im doing firstrate said Billy surprised at the swearing into
which Mr McLean now burst An I aint big enough to get to make money
at any other job

I want to see that engineman muttered Lin I dont like your
smokin friend

Pete Goode Why hes awful smart Dont you think hes smart

Smarts nothin observed Mr McLean

Pete has learned me and Sidney a lot pursued Billy engagingly

Ill bet he has growled the cowpuncher and again Billy was taken
aback at his language

It was not so simple this case To the perturbed mind of Mr McLean it
grew less simple during that day at Golden while Billy recovered and
talked and ate his innocent meals The cowpuncher was far too wise to
think for a single moment of restoring the runaway to his debauched
and shiftless parents Possessed of some imagination he went through
a scene in which he appeared at the Lusk threshold with Billy and
forgiveness and intruded upon a conjugal assault and battery Shucks
said he The kid would be off again inside a week And I dont want him
there anyway

Denver upon the following day saw the little bootblack again at his
corner with his trade not lost but near him stood a tall singular
man with hazel eyes and a sulky expression And citizens during that
week noticed as a new sight in the streets the tall man and the little
boy walking together Sometimes they would be in shops The boy seemed
as happy as possible talking constantly while the man seldom said a
word and his face was serious

Upon Newyears Eve Governor Barker was overtaken by Mr McLean riding a
horse up Hill Street Cheyenne

Hello said Barker staring humorously through his glasses Have a
good drunk

Changed my mind said Lin grinning Proves Ive got one Struck
Christmas all right though

Whos your friend inquired his Excellency

This is Mister Billy Lusk Him and me have agreed that towns aint nice
to live in If Judge Henrys foreman and his wife wont board him at
Sunk Creekwhy Ill fix it somehow

The cowpuncher and his Responsibility rode on together toward the open
plain

Sufferin Moses remarked his Excellency





SEPARS VIGILANTE

We had fallen half asleep my pony and I as we went jogging and
jogging through the long sunny afternoon Our hills of yesterday were
a paleblue coast sunk almost away behind us and ahead our goal
lay shining a little island of houses in this quiet midocean of
sagebrush For two hours it had looked as clear and near as now rising
into sight across the huge dead calm and sinking while we travelled our
undulating imperceptible miles The train had come and gone invisibly
except for its slow pillar of smoke I had watched move westward against
Wyomings stainless sky Though I was still far off the watertank and
other buildings stood out plain and complete to my eyes like childrens
blocks arranged and forgotten on the floor So I rode along hypnotized
by the sameness of the lazy splendid plain and almost unaware of the
distant rider till suddenly he was close and hailing me

Theyve caved he shouted

Who I cried thus awakened

Ah the fool company said he quieting his voice as he drew near
Theyve shed their haughtiness he added confidingly as if I must
know all about it

Where did they learn that wisdom I asked not knowing in the least

Experience he called over his shoulder for already we had met and
passed nothing like experience for sweating the fat off the brain

He yelled me a brotherly goodbye and I am sorry never to have known
more of him for I incline to value any stranger so joyous But now I
waked the pony and trotted briskly surmising as to the company and its
haughtiness I had been viewing my destination across the sagebrush for
so spunout a time that as constantly in Wyoming journeys the
emotion of arrival had evaporated long before the event and I welcomed
employment for my otherwise highanddry mind Probably he meant the
railroad company certainly something large had happened Even as I
dismounted at the platform another hilarious cowpuncher came out of
the station and at once remarking Theyre going to leave us alone
sprang on his horse and galloped to the corrals down the line where
some cattle were being loaded into a train I went inside for my mail
and here were four more cowpunchers playing with the agent They had
got a letter away from him and he wore his daily look of anxiety to
appreciate the jests of these rollicking people Read it they said to
me and I did read the private document and learned that the railroad
was going to waive its right to enforce law and order here and would
trust to Separs good feeling Nothing more the letter ran will be
done about the initial outrage or the subsequent vandalisms We shall
pass over our wasted outlay in the hope that a policy of friendship will
prove our genuine desire to benefit that section

Initial outrage quoted one of the agent large playmates Aint
they furgivin

Well said I you would have some name for it yourself if you sent a
deputy sheriff to look after your rights and he came back tied to the
cowcatcher

The man smiled luxuriously over this memory

We didnt hurt him none Just returned him to his home Hear about the
label Honey Wiggin pinned on to him Send us along one dozen as per
sample Honeys quaint Yes he drawled judicially Id be mad at
that But if youre making peace with a man because its convenient why
your words must be pleasanter than if you really felt pleasant He took
the paper from me and read sardonically Subsequent vandalisms
wasted outlay I suppose they run this station from charity to the
cattle Saves the poor things walking so far to the other railroad
Policy of friendship genuine desireoh mouthwash And shaking
his bold clever head he daintily flattened the letter upon the head of
the agent Tubercle said he this was their name for the agent who
had told all of us about his lungs it aint your fault we saw their
fine letter They just intended you should give it out how they wouldnt
bother us any more and then wed act square The boysll sit up late
over this joke

Then they tramped to their horses and rode away The spokesman had
hit the vital point unerringly for cowpunchers are shrewdly alive
to frankness and it often draws out the best that is in them but its
opposite affects them unfavorably and I needing sleep sighed to
think of their late sitting up over that joke I walked to the board box
painted Hotel Brunswickhotel in small italics and Brunswick in
enormous capitals the N and the S wrong side up

Here sat a girl outside the door alone Her face was broad wholesome
and strong and her eyes alert and sweet As I came she met me with a
challenging glance of goodwill Those women who journeyed along the
line in the wake of payday to traffic with the men employed a stare well
known but this straight look seemed like the greeting of some pleasant
young cowboy In surprise I forgot to be civil and stepped foolishly by
her to see about supper and lodging

At the threshold I perceived all lodging bespoken On each of the four
beds lay a coat or pistol or other article of dress and I must lodge
myself There were my saddleblanketsrather wet or Lin McLean might
ride in tonight on his way to Riverside or perhaps down at the corrals
I could find some other acquaintance whose habit of washing I trusted
and whose bed I might share Failing these expedients several
empties stood idle upon a siding and the boxlike darkness of these
freightcars was timely Nights were short now Camping out the dawn by
three oclock would flow like silver through the universe and sinking
through my blankets remorselessly pervade my buried hair and brain But
with clean straw in the bottom of an empty I could sleep my fill until
five or six I decided for the empty and opened the supperroom door
where the table was set for more than enough to include me but the
smell of the butter that awaited us drove me out of the Hotel Brunswick
to spend the remaining minutes in the air

I was expecting you said the girl Well if I havent frightened
him She laughed so delightfully that I recovered and laughed too
Why she explained I just knew youd not stay in there Which side
are you going to butter your bread this evening

You had smelt it said I still cloudy with surprise Yes
Unquestionably Very rancid She glanced oddly at me and with less
fellowship in her tone said I was going to warn you when suddenly
down at the corrals the boys began to shoot at large Oh dear she
cried starting up Theres trouble

Not trouble I assured her Too many are firing at once to be in
earnest And you would be safe here

Me A lady without escort Well I should reckon so Leastways we
are respected where I was raised I was anxious for the gentlemen ovah
yondah Shawhan K C branch of the Louavull an Nashvull is my home
The words Louisville and Nashville spoke creamily of Bluegrass

Unescorted all that way I exclaimed

Isnt it awful said she tilting her head with a laugh and showing
the pistol she carried But weve always been awful in Kentucky Now I
suppose New York would never speak to poor me as it passed by And she
eyed me with capable goodhumored satire

Why New York I demanded Guess again

Well she debated well cowboy clothes and city languagehes
English she burst out and then she turned suddenly red and whispered
to herself reprovingly If Im not acting rude

Oh said I rather familiarly

It was sir and please to excuse me If you had started joking so
free with me Id have been insulted When I saw youthe hat and
everythingI took youYou see Ive always been that used to talking
toto folks around Her bright face saddened memories evidently rose
before her and her eyes grew distant

I wished to say Treat me as folks around but this tall country
girl had put us on other terms On discovering I was not folks around
she had taken refuge in deriding me but swiftly feeling no solid ground
there she drew a firm clear womans line between us Plainly she was a
comrade of men in her buoyant innocence secure yet by no means in the
dark as to them

Yes unescorted two thousand miles she resumed and never as far
as twenty from home till last Tuesday I expect youll have to be
scandalized for Id do it right over again tomorrow

Youve got me all wrong said I Im not English Im not New York
I am good American and not bounded by my own farm either No sectional
line or Mason and Dixon or Missouri River tattoos me But you when
you say United States you mean United Kentucky

Did you ever said she staring at what was Greek to heras it is to
most Americans And so if you had a sister back East and she and you
were all there was of you any more and she hadnt seen you sincenot
since you first took to staying out nights and she started to visit
you youd not tell her Fie for shame

Id travel my moneys length to meet her said I

A wave of pain crossed her face Nate didnt know she said then
lightly You see Nates only a boy and regular thoughtless about
writing

Ah So this Nate never wrote and his sister loved and championed him
Many such stray Nates and Bobs and Bills galloped over Wyoming lost and
forgiven

Im starting for him in the Buffalo stage continued the girl

Then Ill have your company on a weary road said I for my journey
was now to that part of the cattle country

To Buffalo she said quickly Then maybe youmaybeMy brother is
Nate Buckner She paused Then youre not acquainted with him

I may have seen him I answered slowly But faces and names out here
come and go

I knew him well enough He was in jail convicted of forgery last week
waiting to go to the penitentiary for five years And even this wild
border community that hated law courts and punishments had not been
sorry for he had cheated his friends too often and the wide charity
of the sagebrush does not cover that sin Beneath his pretty looks and
daring skill with horses they had found vanity and a cold false heart
but his sister could not Here she was come to find him after lonely
years and to this one soul that loved him in the world how was I to
tell the desolation and the disgrace I was glad to hear her ask me if
the stage went soon after supper

Now isnt that a bother said she when I answered that it did not
start till morning She glanced with rueful gayety at the hotel Never
mind she continued briskly Im used to things Ill just sit up
somewhere Maybe the agent will let me stay in the office Youre sure
all that shootings only jollification

Certain I said But Ill go and see

They always will have their fun said she But I hate to have a poor
boy get hurteven him deserving it

They use pistols instead of firecrackers said I But you must never
sleep in that office Ill see what we can do

Why youre real kind she exclaimed heartily And I departed
wondering what I ought to do

Perhaps I should have told you before that Separ was a place oncea
sort of place but you will relish now I am convinced the pithy fable
of its name

Midway between two sections of this still unfinished line that rail
after rail and mile upon mile crawled over the earths face visibly
during the constructing hours of each new day lay a camp To this point
these unjoined pieces were heading and here at length they met Camp
Separation it had been fitly called but how should the American
railway man afford time to say that Separation was pretty and apt
but needless and with the sloughing of two syllables came the brief
businesslike resultSepar Chicago 113712 miles It was labelled on
a board large almost as the hut station A Yswitch two sidings the
fat watertank and steampump and a sectionhouse with three trees
before it composed the north side South of the track were no trees
There was one long siding by the corrals and cattlechute there were
a hovel where plug tobacco and canned goods were for sale a shed where
you might get your horse shod a wire fence that at shipping times
enclosed bales of pressed hay the hotel the stage stable and the
little stationsome seven shanties all told Between them were spaces
of dust the immediate plains engulfed them and through their midst
ran the farvanishing railroad to which they hung like beads on a great
string from horizon to horizon A great eastandwest string one end
in the rosy sun at morning and one in the crimson sun at night Beyond
each skyline lay cities and ports where the world went on out of
sight and hearing This lone steel thread had been stretched across the
continent because it was the day of haste and hope when dollars seemed
many and hard times were few and from the Yellowstone to the Rio Grande
similar threads were stretching and little Separs by dispersed hundreds
hung on them as it were in space eternal Can you wonder that vigorous
young men with pistols should when they came to such a place shoot
them off to let loose their unbounded joy of living

And yet it was not this merely that began the custom but an error of
the agents The new station was scarce created when one morning Honey
Wiggin with the Virginian had galloped innocently in from the roundup
to telegraph for some additional cars

Im dead on to you squealed the official dropping flat at the sight
of them and bang went his gun at them They most naturally thought
it was a maniac and ran for their lives among the supports of the
watertank while he remained anchored with his weapon crouched behind
the railing that fenced him and his apparatus from the laity and some
fifteen strategic minutes passed before all parties had crawled forth
to an understanding and the message was written and paid for and
comfortably despatched The agent was an honest creature but of tame
habits sent for the sake of his imperfect lungs to this otherwise
inappropriate air He had lived chiefly in midWest towns a serious
reader of our comic weeklies hence the apparition of Wiggin and the
Virginian had reminded him sickeningly of bandits He had express money
in the safe he explained to them and this was a hard old country
wasnt it and did they like good whiskey

They drank his whiskey but it was not well to have mentioned that
about the bandits Both were aware that when shaved and washed of their
roundup grime they could look very engaging The two cowpunchers rode
out not angry but grieved that a man come here to dwell among them
should be so tactless

If we dont get him used to us observed the Virginian he and his
popgun will be guttin some blameless man

Forthwith the cattle country proceeded to get the agent used to it
The news went over the sagebrush from Belle Fourche to Sweetwater
and playful howling horsemen made it their custom to go rioting
with pistols round the ticket office educating the agent His lungs
improved and he came dimly to smile at this life which he did not
understand But the company discerned no humor whatever in having its
watertank perforated which happened twice and sheriffs and deputies
and other symptoms of authority began to invest Separ Now what
should authority do upon these free plains this wilderness of
doasyouplease where mere breathing the air was like inebriation The
large headlong children who swept in from the sagebrush and out
again meant nothing that they called harm until they found themselves
resisted Then presently happened that affair of the cowcatcher and
later a toozealous marshal come about a mailcar they had
sidetracked and held with fiddles drink and petticoats met his death
accidentally at which they were sincerely sorry for about five minutes
They valued their own lives as little and that lifts them forever
from baseness at least So the company concluding such things must be
endured for a while yet wrote their letter and you have seen how wrong
the letter went All it would do would be from now on to fasten upon
Separ its code of recklessness to make shooting the watertank for
example part of a gentlemans deportment when he showed himself in
town

It was not now the season of heavy shipping tonight their work would
be early finished and then they were likely to play after their manner
To arrive in such a place on her way to her brother the felon in jail
made the girls journey seem doubly forlorn to me as I wandered down to
the corrals

A small bold voice hailed me Hello you it said and here was
Billy Lusk aged nine in boots and overalls importantly useless with a
stick helping the men prod the steers at the chute

Thought you were at school said I

Ah schools quit returned Billy and changed the subject Say
Lins hunting you Hes angling to eat at the hotel Im grubbing with
the outfit And Billy resumed his specious activity

Mr McLean was in the ticketoffice where the newspaper had transiently
reminded him of politics Wall Street he was explaining to the agent
has been lunched on by them Rosschilds and theyre moving on Feeding
along to Chicago We want Here he noticed me and dragging his
gauntlet off shook my hand with his lusty grasp

Your eldest son just said you were in haste to find me I remarked

Lose you he meant The kid gets his words twisted

Didnt know you were a father Mr McLean simpered the agent

Lin fixed his eye on the man And you dont know it now said he Then
he removed his eye Lets grub he added to me My friend did not walk
to the hotel but slowly round and about with a face overcast Billy
is a good kid he said at length and stopping began to kick small
mounds in the dust Politics floated lightly over him but here was a
matter dwelling with him heavy and real Hes dead stuck on being a
cowpuncher he presently said

Some day I began

He dont want to wait that long Lin said and smiled affectionately
And anyhow what is some day Some day we punchers will not be here
The living will be scattered and the deadwell theyll be all right
Have yu studied the wire fence Its spreading to catch us like nets do
the salmon in the Columbia River No more salmon no more cowpunchers
stated Mr McLean sententiously and his words made me sad though I
know that progress cannot spare land and water for such things But
Billy Lin resumed has agreed to school again when it starts up in
the fall He takes his medicine because I want him to Affection crept
anew over the cowpunchers face He can learn books with the quickest
when he wants that Bear Creek schoolmarm says But hed ought to have
a regular mother tilltill I can do for him yu know Its onwholesome
him seeing and hearing the boysand me and me when I forgetbut
shucks how can I fix it Billy was sure enough dropped and deserted
But when I found him the little calf could run and notice like
everything

I should hate your contract Lin said I Adoptings a touchandgo
business even when a man has a home

Ill fill the contract you bet I wish the little sonofagun was
mine Im a heap more natural to him than that pair of drunkards that
got him He likes me I think he does Ive had to lick him now and
then but Lord his badness is all rightnot sneaky Ill take him
hunting next month and then the foremans wife at Sunk Creek boards him
till school Only when they move Judge Henryll make his Virginia man
foremanand hes got no woman to look after Billy yu see

Hes asking one hard enough said I digressing

Oh yes asking Talk of adopting said Mr McLean and his wideopen
hazel eyes looked away as he coughed uneasily Then abruptly looking at
me again he said Dont you get off any more truck about eldest son
and that will yu friend The boys are joshing me nownot that I
care for what might easy enough be so but theres Billy Maybe hed
not mind but maybe he would after a while and I am kind o set
onwellhe didnt have a good time till he shook that home of his and
Im going to make this old bitch of a world pay him what she owes him
if I can Now youll drop joshing wont yu His forehead was moist
over getting the thing said and laying bare so much of his soul

And so the world owes us a good time Lin said I

He laughed shortly She must have been dead broke then quite a while
you bet Oh no Maybe I used to travel on that basis But see here
Lin laid his hand on my shoulder if you cant expect a good time
for yourself in reason you can sure make the kids happy out o reason
cant yu

I fairly opened my mouth at him

Oh yes he said laughing in that short way again and he took his
hand off my shoulder Ive been thinking a wonderful lot since we met
last I guess I know some things yu havent got to yet yourselfWhy
theres a girl

That there is said I And certainly the world owes her a better

Shes a finelooker interrupted Mr McLean paying me no further
attention Here the decrepit strawhatted proprietor of the Hotel
Brunswick stuck his beard out of the door and uttered Supper with a
shrill croak at which the girl rose

Come said Lin lets hurry

But I hooked my fingers in his belt and in spite of his plaintive oaths
at my losing him the best seat at the table told him in three words the
sisters devoted journey

Nate Buckner he exclaimed Him with a decent sister

Its the other way round said I Her with him for a brother

He goes to the penitentiary this week said Lin He had no more cash
to stake his lawyer with and the lawyer lost interest in him So his
sister could have waited for her convict away back at Joliet and saved
time and money How did she act when yu told her

Ive not told her

Not Too kind o not your business Well well Youd ought to know
better n me Only it dont seem right to let herno sir its not
right either Put it her brother was dead and Miss Fliggs husband
would like dearly to make him dead youd not let her come slap up
against the news unwarned You would tell her he was sick and start her
gently

Deaths different said I

Shucks And shes to find him caged and waiting for stripes and a
shaved head How d yu know she mightnt hate that worse n if hed
been just shot like a man in a husband scrape instead of jailed like a
skunk for thieving No sir she mustnt Think of how itll be Quick
as the stage pulls up front o the Buffalo postoffice plump shell be
down ahead of the mailsacks inquiring after her brother and all that
crowd around staring Why we cant let her do that she cant do that
If you dont feel so interfering Im good for this job myself And Mr
McLean took the lead and marched jingling in to supper

The seat he had coveted was vacant On either side the girl were empty
chairs two or three for with that clean shy respect of the frontier
that divines and evades a good woman the dusty company had sat itself
at a distance and Mr McLeans best seat was open to him Yet he had
veered away to the other side of the table and his usually roving eye
attempted no gallantry He ate sedately and it was not until after long
weeks and many happenings that Miss Buckner told Lin she had known he
was looking at her through the whole of this meal The strawhatted
proprietor came and went bearing beefsteak hammered flat to make it
tender The girl seemed the one happy person among us for supper was
going forward with the invariable alkali etiquette all faces brooding
and feeding amid a disheartening silence as of guilt or bereavement that
springs from I have never been quite sure whatperhaps reversion to the
native animal absorbed in his meat perhaps a little from every guests
uneasiness lest he drink his coffee wrong or stumble in the accepted
uses of the fork Indeed a diffident uncleansed youth nearest Miss
Buckner presently wiped his mouth upon the cloth and Mr McLean
knowing better than that eyed him for this conduct in the presence of a
lady The lively strength of the butter must I think have reached all
in the room at any rate the tablecloth lad troubled by Mr McLeans
eye now relieved the general silence by observing chattily

Say friends that butter aint in no trance

If its too rich for you croaked the enraged proprietor use
axledope

The company continued gravely feeding while I struggled to preserve
the decorum of sadness and Miss Buckners face was also unsteady But
sternness mantled in the countenance of Mr McLean until the harmless
boy embarrassed to pieces offered the untasted smellingdish to Lin
to me helped himself and finally thrust the plate at the girl saying
in his Texas idiom

Have butter

He spoke in the shell voice of adolescence and on butter cracked an
octave up into the treble Miss Buckner was speechless and could only
shake her head at the plate

Mr McLean however thought she was offended She wouldnt choose for
none he said to the youth with appalling calm Thank yu most to
death

I guess fluted poor Texas in a dove falsetto it would go slicker
rubbed outside than swallered

At this Miss Buckner broke from the table and fled out of the house

You dont seem to know anything observed Mr McLean What toyshop
did you escape from

Wind him up Wind him up said the proprietor sticking his head in
from the kitchen

Ah whats the matter with this outfit screamed the boy furiously
Cant yu leave a man eat Cant yu leave him be You make me sick
And he flounced out with his young boots

All the while the company fed on unmoved Presently one remarked

Whos hiring him

The C Y outfit said another

Halfcircle L a third corrected

I seen one like him onced said the first taking his hat from beneath
his chair Up in the Black Hills he was Eighteen seventynine Gosh
And he wandered out upon his business One by one the others also
silently dispersed

Upon going out Lin and I found the boy pacing up and down eagerly in
talk with Miss Buckner She had made friends with him and he was now
smoothed down and deeply absorbed being led by her to tell her about
himself But on Lins approach his face clouded and he made off for the
corrals displaying a sullen back while I was presenting Mr McLean to
the lady

Overtaken by his cowpuncher shyness Lin was greeting her with ungainly
ceremony when she began at once Youll excuse me but I just had to
have my laugh

Thats all right mm said he dont mention it

For that boy you know

Ill fix him mm Hell not insult yu no more Ill speak to him

Now please dont Whywhyyou were every bit as bad Miss Buckner
pealed out joyously It was the two of you Oh dear

Mr McLean looked crestfallen I had noI didnt go to

Why there was no harm To see him mean so well and you mean so well
andI know I ought to behave better

No yu oughtnt said Lin with sudden ardor and then in a voice of
deprecation Youll think us plumb ignorant

You know enough to be kind to folks said she

Wed like to

Its the only thing makes the world go round she declared with an
emotion that I had heard in her tone once or twice already But she
caught herself up and said gayly to me And wheres that house you
were going to build for a lone girl to sleep in

Im afraid the foundations arent laid yet said I

Now you gentlemen neednt bother about me

Well have to mm You aint used to Separ

Oh I am notenderfoot dont you call them She whipped out her
pistol and held it at the cowpuncher laughing

This would have given no pleasure to me but over Lins features went a
glow of delight and he stood gazing at the pointed weapon and the girl
behind it My he said at length almost in a whisper shes got the
drop on me

I reckon Id be afraid to shoot that one of yours said Miss Buckner
But this hits a target real good and straight at fifteen yards And
she handed it to him for inspection

He received it hugely grinning and turned it over and over My
he murmured again Why shucks He looked at Miss Buckner with stark
rapture caressing the polished revolver at the same time with a fond
unconscious thumb You hold it just as steady as I could he said with
pride and added insinuatingly I could learn yu the professional
drop in a morning This here is a little dandy gun

Youd not trade though said she for all your flattery

Will yu trade pounced Lin Wont yu

Now Mr McLean I am afraid youre thoughtless How could a girl like
me ever hold that awful45 Colt steady

She knows the brands too cried Lin in ecstasy See here he
remarked to me with a manner that smacked of command were losing time
right now You go and tell the agent to hustle and fix his room up for a
lady and Ill bring her along

I found the agent willing of course to sleep on the floor of the
office The toy station was also his home The front compartment held
the ticket and telegraph and mail and express chattels and the railing
and room for the public to stand through a door you then passed to
the sitting dining and sleeping box and through another to a
cookingstove in a pigeonhole Here flourished the agent and his lungs
and here the companys strict orders bade him sleep in charge so
I helped him put his room to rights But we need not have hurried
ourselves Mr McLean was so long in bringing the lady that I went
out and found him walking and talking with her while fifty yards away
skulked poor Texas alone This boys name was like himself of the
somewhat unexpected order being Manassas Donohoe

As I came towards the new friends they did not appear to be joking and
on seeing me Miss Buckner said to Lin Did he know

Lin hesitated

You did know she exclaimed but lost her resentment at once and
continued very quietly and with a friendly tone I reckon you dont
like to have to tell folks bad news

It was I that now hesitated

Not to a strange girl anyway said she Well now I have good news
to tell you You would not have given me any shock if you had said you
knew about poor Nate for thats the reasonOf course those things
cant be secrets Why hes only twenty sir How should he know about
this world He hadnt learned the first little thing when he left
home five years ago And I am twentythreeold enough to be Nates
grandmother hes that young and thoughtless He couldnt ever realize
bad companions when they came around See that She showed me a paper
taking it out like a precious thing as indeed it was for it was a
pardon signed by Governor Barker And the Governor has let me carry
it to Nate myself He wont know a thing about it till I tell him The
Governor was real kind and we will never forget him I reckon Nate must
have a mustache by now said she to Lin

Yes Lin answered gruffly looking away from her he has got a
mustache all right

Hell be glad to see you said I for something to say

Of course he will How many hours did you say we will be she asked
Lin turning from me again for Mr McLean had not been losing time It
was plain that between these two had arisen a freemasonry from which I
was already shut out Her womans heart had answered his right impulse
to tell her about her brother and I had been found wanting

So now she listened over again to the hours of stage jolting that
we had before us and that lay between her and Nate We would be
fourherself Lin myself and the boy Billy Was Billy the one at
supper Oh no just Billy Lusk of Laramie Hes a kid Im taking up
the country Lin explained Aint you most tuckered out

Oh me she confessed with a laugh and a sigh

There again She had put aside my solicitude lightly but was willing
Lin should know her fatigue Yet fatigue and all she would not sleep
in the agents room At sight of it and the close quarters she drew back
into the outer office so prompted by that inner unsuspected strictness
she had shown me before

Come out she cried laughing Indeed I thank you But I cant have
you sleep on this hard floor out here No politeness now Thank you
ever so much Im used to roughing it pretty near as well as if I wasa
cowboy And she glanced at Lin Theyre calling fortyseven she
added to the agent

Thats me he said coming out to the telegraph instrument So youre
one of us

I didnt know fortyseven meant Separ said I How in the world do
you know that

I didnt I heard fortyseven fortyseven fortyseven start and go
right along so I guessed they wanted him and he couldnt hear them
from his room

Can yu do astronomy and Spanish too inquired the proud and smiling
McLean

Why its nothing Ive been day operator back home Why is a deputy
coming through on a special engine

Please dont say it out loud quavered the agent as the machine
clicked its news

Yu neednt be scared of a girl said Lin Another sheriff So
theyre not quit bothering us yet

However this meddling was not the companys but the countys a
sheriff sent to arrest on a charge of murder a man named Trampas
said to be at the Sand Hill Ranch That was near Rawhide two stations
beyond and the engine might not stop at Separ even to water So here
was no molesting of Separs liberties

All the same Lin said for pistols now and then still sounded at the
corrals the boysll not understand that till its explained and they
may act wayward first Id feel easier if you slept here he urged
to the girl But she would not Well then we must rustle some other
private place for you Hows the sectionhouse

Rank said the agent since those Italians used it The pump engineer
has been scouring but hes scared to bunk there yet himself

Too bad you couldnt try my plan of a freightcar said I

An empty she cried Is there a clean one

Youve sure never done that Lin burst out

So youre scandalized said she punishing him instantly I reckon it
does take a decent girl to shock you And while she stood laughing
at him with robust irony poor Lin began to stammer that he meant no
offence Why to be sure you didnt said she But I do enjoy you
real thoroughly

Well mm protested the wincing cowpuncher driven back to
addressing her as maam we aint used

Dont tangle yourself up worse Mr McLean No more am I used I have
never slept in an empty in my life And why is that Just because Ive
never had to And theres the difference between you boys and us You do
lots of things you dont like and tell us And we put up with lots of
things we dont like but we never let you find out I know you meant
no offense she continued heartily softening towards her crushed
protector because youre a gentleman And lands Im not complaining
about an empty That will be richif I can have the door shut

Upon this she went out to view the cars Mr McLean hovering behind her
with a devoted uneasy countenance and frequently muttering Shucks
while the agent and I followed with a lamp for the dark was come With
our help she mounted into the first car and then into the next taking
the lamp And while she scanned the floor and corners and slid the door
back and forth Lin whispered in my ear Her names Jessamine She
told me Dont yu like that name So I answered him Yes very much
thinking that some larger flowerbut still a flowermight have been
more apt

Nobody seems to have slept in these said she stepping down and on
learning that even the tramp avoided Separ when he could she exclaimed
What lodging could be handier than this Only it would be so cute if
you had a Louavull an Nashvull car said she Twould seem like my old
Kentucky home And laughing rather sweetly at her joke she held
the lamp up to read the cars lettering D and R G Oh thats
a wayoff stranger I reckon theyre all strange She went along the
train with her lamp Yes B and M and S C and P Oh this is
rich Nate will laugh when he hears Ill choose C B and Q Thats
a little nearer my country What time does the stage start Porter
please wake C B and Q at six sharp said she to Lin

From this point of the evening on I think of our doingstheir
doingswith a sort of unchanging homesickness Nothing like them can
ever happen again I know for its all gonesettled sobered and
gone And whatever wholesomer prose of good fortune waits in our cup
how I thank my luck for this swallow of frontier poetry which I came in
time for

To arrange some sort of bed for her was the next thing and we made a
good shakedownclean straw and blankets and a pillow and the agent
would have brought sheets but though she would not have these she did
not resistwhat do you supposea lookingglass for next morning
And we got a bucket of water and her valise It was all one to her
she said in what car Lin and I put up and let it be next door by all
means if it pleased him to think he could watch over her safety better
so and she shut herself in bidding us goodnight We began spreading
straw and blankets for ourselves when a whistle sounded far and long
and its tone rose in pitch as it came

Ill get him to run right to the corrals said the agent so the
sheriff can tell the boys hes not after them

Thatll convince em he is said Lin Stop him here or let him go
through

But we were not to steer the course that events took now The rails
of the main line beside us brightened in wavering parallels as the
headlight grew down upon us and in this same moment the shootings at
the corrals chorused in a wild hilarious threat The burden of the
coming engine heavily throbbed in the air and along the steel and met
and mixed with the hard light beating of hoofs The sounds approached
together like a sort of charge and I stepped between the freightcars
where I heard Lin ordering the girl inside to lie down flat and could
see the agent running about in the dust flapping his arms to signal
with as much coherence as a chicken with its head off I had very short
space for wonder or alarm The edge of one of my freightcars glowed
suddenly with the imminent headlight and galloping shots invaded the
place The horsemen flew by overreaching and leaning back and lugging
against their impetus They passed in a tangled swirl and their dust
coiled up thick from the dark ground and luminously unfolded across the
glare of the sharphalted locomotive Then they wheeled and clustered
around it where it stood by our cars its airbrake pumping deep
breaths and the internal steam humming through its bowels and I came
out in time to see Billy Lusk climb its front with callow enterprising
shouts That was childs play and the universal yell now raised by
the horsemen was their childs play too but the whole thing could so
precipitately reel into the fatal that my thoughts stopped I could only
look when I saw that they had somehow recognized the man on the
engine for a sheriff Two had sprung from their horses and were making
boisterously toward the cab while Lin McLean neither boisterous nor
joking was going to the cab from my side with his pistol drawn to
keep the peace The engineer sat with a neutral hand on the lever the
fireman had run along the top of the coal in the tender and descended
and crouched somewhere and the sheriff cool and with a goodnatured
eye upon all parties was just beginning to explain his errand when
some rider from the crowd cut him short with an invitation to get down
and have a drink At the word of ribald endearment by which he named the
sheriff a passing fierceness hardened the officers face and the new
yell they gave was less playful Waiting no more explanations they
swarmed against the locomotive and McLean pulled himself up on the
step The loud talking fell at a stroke to let business go on and in
this silence came the noise of a slidingdoor At that I looked and
they all looked and stood harmless like children surprised For there
on the threshold of the freightcar with the interior darkness behind
her and touched by the headlights diverging rays stood Jessamine
Buckner

Will you gentlemen do me a favor said she Strangers maybe have
no right to ask favors but I reckon youll let that pass this time For
Im real sleepy She smiled as she brought this out Ive been four
days and nights on the cars and tomorrow Ive got to stage to Buffalo
You see Ill not be here to spoil your fun tomorrow night and I want
boys to be boys just as much as ever they can Wont you put it off till
tomorrow night

In their amazement they found no spokesman but I saw Lin busy among
them and that some word was passing through their groups After the
brief interval of standstill they began silently to get on their
horses while the looming engine glowed and pumped its breath and the
sheriff and engineer remained as they were

Goodnight lady said a voice among the moving horsemen but the
others kept their abashed native silence and thus they slowly filed
away to the corrals The figures in their loose shirts and leathern
chaps passed from the dimness for a moment through the cone of light
in front of the locomotive so that the metal about them made here and
there a faint vanishing glint and here and there in the departing
column a bold halflaughing face turned for a look at the girl in the
doorway and then was gone again into the dimness

The sheriff in the cab took off his hat to Miss Buckner remarking that
she should belong to the force and as the bell rang and the engine
moved off popped young Billy Lusk from his cowcatcher With an
exclamation of horror she sprang down and Mr McLean appeared and
with all a parents fright and rage held the boy by the arm grotesquely
as the sheriff steamed by

I aint agoing to chase it said young Billy struggling

Ive a mind to cowhide you said Lin

But Miss Buckner interposed Oh well said she next time if he
does it next time Its so late tonight Youll not frighten us that
way again if he lets you off she asked Billy

No said Billy looking at her with interest Father d have cowhided
me anyway I guess he added meditatively

Do you call him father

Ah fathers at Laramie said Billy with disgust Hed not stop for
your asking Lin dont bother me much

You quit talking and step up there ordered his guardian Well mm
I guess yu can sleep good now in there

If it was only an L and N Id not have a thing against it
Goodnight Mr McLean goodnight young Mr

Im Billy Lusk I can ride Chalkeyes pinto that bucked Honey Wiggin

I am sure you can ride finely Mr Lusk Maybe you and I can take a
ride together Pleasant dreams

She nodded and smiled to him and slid her door to and Billy considered
it remarking I like her What makes her live in a car

But he was drowsing while I told him and I lifted him up to Lin who
took him in his own blankets where he fell immediately asleep One
distant whistle showed how far the late engine had gone from us We left
our car open and I lay enjoying the cool air Thus was I drifting off
when I grew aware of a figure in the door It was Lin standing in his
stockings and not much else with his pistol He listened and then
leaped down light as a cat I heard some repressed talking and lay in
expectancy but back he came noiseless in his stockings and as he
slid into bed I asked what the matter was He had found the Texas
boy Manassas Donohoe by the girls car with no worse intention than
keeping a watch on it So I gave him to understand said Lin that I
had no objection to him amusing himself playing picketline but that
I guessed I was enough guard and he would find sleep healthier for
his system After this I went to sleep wholly but waking once in the
night thought I heard some one outside and learned in the morning from
Lin that the boy had not gone until the time came for him to join
his outfit at the corrals And I was surprised that Lin the usually
goodhearted should find nothing but mirth in the idea of this unknown
unthanked young sentinel Sleepings a heap better for them kind till
they get their growth was his single observation

But when Separ had dwindled to toys behind us in the journeying stage
I told Miss Jessamine and although she laughed too it was with a note
that young Texas would have liked to hear and she hoped she might see
him upon her return to thank him

Any Jack can walk around all night said Mr McLean disparagingly

Well then and I know a Jack who didnt observed the young lady

This speech caused her admirer to be full of explanations so that
when she saw how readily she could perplex him and yet how capable and
untiring he was about her comfort helping her out or tucking her in
at the stations where we had a meal or changed horses she enjoyed the
hours very much in spite of their growing awkwardness

But oh the sparkling unbashful Lin Sometimes he sat himself beside
her to be close and then he would move opposite the better to behold
her

Never except once long after when sorrow manfully borne had still
further refined his clay have I heard Lins voice or seen his look
so winning No doubt many a male bird cares nothing what neighbor bird
overhears his spring song from the top of the open tree but I extremely
doubt if his ladylove even if she be a frank bouncing robin does
not prefer to listen from some thicket and not upon the public lawn
Jessamine grew silent and almost peevish and from discourse upon man
and woman she hopped she skipped she flew When Lin looked at his
watch and counted the diminished hours between her and Buffalo she
smiled to herself but from mention of her brother she shrank glancing
swiftly at me and my wellassumed slumber

And it was with indignation and selfpity that I climbed out in the hot
sun at last beside the driver and small Billy

I know this road piped Billy on the box

I camped here with father when mother was off that time You can take
a lefthand trail by those cottonwoods and strike the mountains

So I inquired what game he had then shot

Ah just a sagehen Lins agoing to let me shoot a bear you know
What made Lin marry mother when father was around

The driver gave me a look over Billys head and I gave him one and I
instructed Billy that people supposed his father was dead I withheld
that his mother gave herself out as Miss Peck in the days when Lin met
her on Bear Creek

The formidable nineyearold pondered The geography says they used to
have a lot of wives at Salt Lake City Is there a place where a woman
can have a lot of husbands

It dont especially depend on the place remarked the driver to me

Because Billy went on Bert Taylor told me in recess that motherd
had a lot and I told him he lied and the other boys they laughed and
I blacked Berts eye on him and Id have blacked the others too
only Miss Wood came out I wouldnt tell her what Bert said and Bert
wouldnt and Sophy Armstrong told her Berts father found out and he
come round and I thought he was agoing to lick me about the eye and
he licked Bert Say am I Lins honest

No Billy youre not I said

Wish I was They couldnt get me back to Laramie then but oh bother
Id not go for em Id like to see em try Lin wouldnt leave me go
You aint married are you No more is Lin now I guess A good many
are but I wouldnt want to I dont think anything of em Ive seen
mother take pothecary stuff on the sly Shes whaled me worse than Lin
ever does I guess he wouldnt want to be mothers husband again and if
he does said Billy his voice suddenly vindictive Ill quit him and
skip

No danger Bill said I

How would the nice lady inside please you inquired the driver

Ah pshaw she aint after Lin sang out Billy loud and scornful
Shes after her brother Shes all right though he added
approvingly

At this all talk stopped short inside reviving in a casual scanty
manner while unconscious Billy Lusk tired of the one subject now
spoke cheerfully of birds eggs

Who knows the childsoul young in days yet old as Adam and the hills
That schoolyard slur about his mother was as dim to his understanding
as to the offenders yet mysterious nature had bid him go to instant
war How foreseeing in Lin to choke the unfounded jest about his
relation to Billy Lusk in hopes to save the boys ever awakening to
the facts of his mothers life Though said the driver an easygoing
cynic folks with lots of fathers will find heaps of brothers in this
country But presently he let Billy hold the reins and at the next
station carefully lifted him down and up Ive knowed that woman too
he whispered to me Sidney Nebraska Lusk was off half the time We
laughed when she fooled Lin into marryin her Come to think he mused
as twilight deepened around our clanking stage and small Billy slept
sound between us theres scarcely a thing in life you get a laugh out
of that dont make soberness for somebody

Soberness had now visited the pair behind us even Lins lively talk had
quieted and his tones were low and few But though Miss Jessamine at
our next change of horses hoped I would come inside I knew she did
not hope very earnestly and outside I remained until Buffalo

Journeying done her face revealed the strain beneath her brave
brightness and the haunting care she could no longer keep from her
eyes The imminence of the jail and the meeting had made her cheeks
white and her countenance seem actually smaller and when reminding me
that we should meet again soon she gave me her hand it was icecold
I think she was afraid Lin might offer to go with her But his heart
understood the lonely sacredness of her next halfhour and the cow
puncher standing aside for her to pass lifted his hat wistfully
and spoke never a word For a moment he looked after her with sombre
emotion but the courthouse and prison stood near and in sight and
as plain as if he had said so I saw him suddenly feel she should not be
stared at going up those steps it must be all alone the pain and the
joy of that reprieve He turned away with me and after a few silent
steps said Wasted all wasted

Let us hope I began

Youre not a fool he broke in roughly You dont hope anything

Hell start life elsewhere said I

Elsewhere Yes keep starting till all the elsewheres know him like
Powder River knows him But she I have had to sit and hear her tell and
tell about him all about back in Kentucky playin around the farm and
how she raised him after the old folks died Then he got bigger and made
her sell their farm and she told how it was right he should turn it
into money and get his half I did not dare say a word for shed have
just bit my head off andand that would sure hurt me now Lin brought
up with a comical chuckle And she went to work and he cleared out
and no more seen or heard of him Thats for five years and shed given
up tracing him when one morning she reads in the paper about how her
longlost brother is convicted for forgery Thats the way she knows
hes not dead and she takes her savings off her railroad salary and
starts for him She was that hasty she thought it was Buffalo New York
till she got in the cars and read the paper over again But she had
to go as far as Cincinnati either way She has paid every cent of the
money he stole We had come to the bridge and Lin jerked a stone
into the quick little river Shes awful strict in some ways Thought
Buffalo must be a wicked place because of the shops bein open Sunday
Now if that was all Buffalos wickedness And she thinks divorce is
mostly sin But her heart is a shield for Nate

Her face is as beautiful as her actions he added

Well said I and would you make such a villain your brotherinlaw

He whirled round and took both my shoulders Come walking he urged
I must talk some So we followed the stream out of town towards the
mountains I came awful near asking her in the stage said he

Goodness Lin give yourself time

Time cant increase my feelings

Hers man hers How many hours have you known her

Hours and hours Youre talking foolishness What have they got to do
with it And she will listen to me I can tell she will I know I can
be so shell listen and it will go all right for Ill ask so hard
And everythingll come out straight Yu see Ive not been spending
to speak of since Billys on my hands and now Ill fix up my cabin and
finish my fencing and my ditchand shes going to like Box Elder Creek
better than Shawhan Shes the first Ive ever loved

Then Id like to ask I cried out

Ask away he exclaimed inattentively in his enthusiasm

When you but I stopped perceiving it impossible It was of
course not the many transient passions on which he had squandered his
substance but the one where faith also had seemed to unite Had he
not married once innocent of the womans being already a wife But I
stopped for to trench here was not for me or any one

And my pause strangely flashed on him something of that I had in my
mind

No he said his eyes steady and serious upon me dont you ask about
the things youre meaning Then his face grew radiant and rather
stern Do you suppose I dont know shes too good for me And that some
bygones cant ever be bygones But if you he said never come to look
away up to a woman from away down and mean to win her just the same as
if you did deserve her why youll make a turruble mess of the whole
business

When we walked in silence for a long while he lighted again with the
blossoming dawn of his sentiment I thought of the coarse yet taking
vagabond of twenty I had once chanced upon and hunted and camped with
since through the years Decidedly he was not that boy today It is
not true that all of us rise through adversity any more than that all
plants need shadow Some starve out of the sunshine and I have seen
misery deaden once kind people to everything but selfalmost the
saddest sight in the world But Lins character had not stood well the
ordeal of happiness and for him certainly harsh days and responsibility
had been needed to ripen the spirit Yes Jessamine Buckner would have
been much too good for him before that humiliation of his marriage and
this care of young Billy with which he had loaded himself Lin said
I I will drink your health and luck

Im healthy enough said he and we came back to the main street and
into the main saloon

How dye boys said some one and there was Nate Buckner Its on me
today he continued shoving whiskey along the bar and I saw he was
a little drunk Im setting em up he continued Why Why
becausehe looked around for appreciationbecause its not every
sonofagun in Wyoming gets pardoned by Governor Barker Im important
I want you to understand he pursued to the cold bystanders Theyll
have a picture of me in the Cheyenne paper The Broncobuster of Powder
River They cant do without me If any sonofagun here thinks
he knows how to break a colt he shouted looking around with the
irrelevant fierceness of drinkand then his challenge ebbed vacantly in
laughter as the subject blurred in his mind Youre not drinking Lin
said he

No said McLean Im not

Sworn off again Well water never did agree with me

Yu never gave water the chance retorted the cowpuncher and we left
the place without my having drunk his health

It was a grim beginning this brag attempt to laugh his reputation down
with the jail door scarce closed behind him Folks are not going to
like that said Lin as we walked across the bridge again to the hotel
Yet the sister left alone here after an hour at most of her brothers
company would pretend it was a matter of course Nate was not in she
told us at once He had business to attend to and friends to see he must
get back to Riverside and down in that country where colts were waiting
for him He was the only one the E K outfit would allow to handle
their young stock Did we know that And she was going to stay with a
Mrs Pierce down there for a while near where Nate would be working
All this she told us but when he did not return to dine with her
on this first day I think she found it hard to sustain her wilful
cheeriness Lin offered to take her driving to see the military post and
dress parade at retreat and Clouds Peak and Buffalos various sights
but she made excuses and retired to her room Nate however was at tea
shaven clean with good clothes and well conducted His tone and manner
to Jessamine were confidential and caressing and offended Mr McLean
so that I observed to him that it was scarcely reasonable to be jealous

Oh no jealousy said he But he comes in and kisses her and
he kisses her goodnight and us strangers looking on Its such
oncontrollable affection yu see after never writing for five years I
expect she must have some of her savings left

It is true that the sister gave the brother money more than once and as
our ways lay together I had chances to see them both and to wonder if
her joy at being with him once again was going to last On the road to
Riverside I certainly heard Jessamine beg him to return home with her
and he ridiculed such a notion What proper life for a live man was that
dead place back East he asked her I thought he might have expressed
some regret that they must dwell so far apart or some intention to
visit her now and then but he said nothing of the sort though he
spoke volubly of himself and his prospects I suppose this spectacle of
brother and sister had rubbed Lin the wrong way too much for he held
himself and Billy aloof joining me on the road but once and then
merely to give me the news that people here wanted no more of Nate
Buckner he would be run out of the country and respect for the sister
was all that meanwhile saved him But Buckner like so many spared
criminals seemed brazenly unaware he was disgraced and went hailing
loudly any riders or drivers we met while beside him his sister sat
close and straight her stanch affection and support for the world to
see For all she let appear she might have been bringing him back from
some gallant heroism achieved and as I rode along the travesty seemed
more and more pitiful the outcome darker and darker

At all times is Riverside beautiful but most beautiful when the sun
draws down through the openings of the hills From each one a stream
comes flowing clearly out into the plain and fields spread green along
the margins It was beneath the longslanted radiance of evening that
we saw Blue Creek and felt its coolness rise among the shifting veils of
light The red bluff eastward the tall natural fortress lost its stern
masonry of shapes and loomed a soft towering enchantment of violet and
amber and saffron in the changing rays The cattle stood quiet about
the levels and horses were moving among the restless colts These the
brother bade his sister look at for with them was his glory and I
heard him boasting of his skilltruthful boasting to be sure Had
he been honest in his dealings the goodwill that mans courage and
dashing appearance beget in men would have brought him more employment
than he could have undertaken He told Jessamine his way of breaking a
horse that few would dare and she listened eagerly Do you remember
when I used to hold the pony for you to get on she said You always
would scare me Nate And he replied fluently Yes yes did she see
that horse there near the fence He was a fouryearold an outlaw and
she would find no one had tried getting on his back since he had been
absent This was the first question he asked on reaching the cabin
where various neighbors were waiting the mailrider and finding he was
right he turned in pride to Jessamine

They dont know how to handle that horse said he I told you so
Give me a rope

Did she notice the cold greeting Nate received I think not Not only
was their welcome to her the kinder but any one is glad to witness bold
riding and this chance made a stir which the sister may have taken for
cordiality But Lin gave me a look for it was the same here as it had
been in the Buffalo saloon

The trick is easy enough said Nate arriving with his outlaw and
liking an audience You dont want a bridle but a rope hackamore like
thisSpanish style Then let them run as hard as they want and on a
sudden reach down your arm and catch the hackamore short close up by
the mouth and jerk them round quick and heavy at full speed They quit
their fooling after one or two doses Now watch your outlaw

He went into the saddle so swift and secure that the animal amazed
trembled stockstill then sprang headlong It stopped vicious and
knowing and plunged in a rage but could do nothing with the man and
bolted again and away in a straight blind line over the meadow when
the rider leaned forward to his trick The horse veered in a jagged
swerve rolled over and over with its twisted impetus and up on its
feet and on without a stop the man still seated and upright in the
saddle How we cheered to see it But the figure now tilted strangely
and something awful and nameless came over us and chilled our noise
to silence The horse dazed and tamed by the fall brought its burden
towards us a wobbling thing falling by small shakes backward until
the head sank on the horses rump

Come away said Lin McLean to Jessamine and at his voice she obeyed
and went leaning on his arm

Jessamine sat by her brother until he died twelve hours afterwards
having spoken and known nothing The whole weight of the horse
had crushed him internally He must have become almost instantly
unconscious being held in the saddle by his spurs which had caught in
the hair cinch it may be that our loud cheer was the last thing of this
world that he knew The injuries to his body made impossible any taking
him home which his sister at first wished to do Why I came here to
bring him home she said with a smile and tone like cheerfulness in
wax Her calm the unearthly ease with which she spoke to any comer and
she was surrounded with rough kindness embarrassed the listeners she
saw her calamity clear as they did but was sleepwalking in it It was
Lin gave her what she neededthe repose of his strong silent presence
He spoke no sympathy and no advice nor even did he argue with her about
the burial he perceived somehow that she did not really hear what was
said to her and that these first griefless sensible words came from
some mechanism of the nerves so he kept himself near her and let her
tell her story as she would Once I heard him say to her with the
same authority of that first come away Now youve had enough of
the talking Come for a walk Enough of the talkingas if it were
a treatment How did he think of that Jessamine at any rate again
obeyed him and I saw the two going quietly about in the meadows and
along the curving brook and that night she slept well On one only
point did the cowpuncher consult me

They figured to put Nate on top of that bald mound said he But
she has talked about the flowers and shade where the old folks lie and
where she wants him to be alongside of them Ive not let her look at
him today forwell she might get the way he looks now on her memory
But Id like to show you my idea before going further

Lin had indeed chosen a beautiful place and so I told him at the first
sight of it

Thats all I wanted to know said he Ill fix the rest

I believe he never once told Jessamine the body could not travel so far
as Kentucky I think he let her live and talk and grieve from hour
to hour and then led her that afternoon to the nook of sunlight and
sheltering trees and won her consent to it thus for there was Nate
laid and there she went to sit alone Lin did not go with her on those
walks

But now something new was on the fellows mind He was plainly occupied
with it whatever else he was doing and he had some active cattlework
On my asking him if Jessamine Buckner had decided when to return east
he inquired of me angrily what was there in Kentucky she could
not have in Wyoming Consequently though I surmised what he must be
debating I felt myself invited to keep out of his confidence and I did
so My advice to him would have been ill received andas was soon to
be made plainwould have done his delicacy injustice Next one morning
he and Billy were gone My first thought was that he had rejoined
Jessamine at Mrs Pierces where she was and left me away over here on
Bear Creek where we had come for part of a week

But stuck in my hatband I found a pencilled farewell

Now Mr McLean constructed perhaps three letters in the yearpainful
serious eventslike an interview with some important person with whom
your speech must decorously flow No matter to whom he was writing it
froze all nature stiff in each word he achieved and his bald business
diction and wild archaic penmanship made documents that I value among my
choicest correspondence this one especially


 Wensday four a m

DEAR SIR this is to Inform you that i have gone to Separ on important
bisness where i expect to meet you on your arrival at same point You
will confer a favor and oblidge undersigned by Informing Miss J Buckner
of date if soon you fix for returning per stage to Separ as Miss
J Buckner may prefer company for the trip being long and poor
accommodations

 Yours c L McLEAN


This seemed to point but one way and uncharitable though it sound
that this girl so close upon bereavement should be able to give
herself to a lover was distasteful to me

But most extraordinary Lin had gone away without a word to her and
she was left as plainly in the dark as myself After her first frank
surprise at learning of his departure his name did not come again from
her lips at any rate to me Good Mrs Pierce dropped a word one day as
to her opinion of men who deceive women into expecting something from
them

Let us talk straight said I Do you mean that Miss Buckner says
that or that you say it

Why the poor thing says nothing exclaimed the lady Its like a man
to think she would And Ill not say anything either for youre all
just the same except when youre worse and that Lin McLean is going to
know what I think of him next time we meet

He did On that occasion the kind old dame told him he was the best boy
in the country and stood on her toes and kissed him But meanwhile we
did not know why he had gone and Jessamine though he was never subtle
or cruel enough to plan such a thing missed him and thus in her
loneliness had the chance to learn how much he had been to her

Though pressed to stay indefinitely beneath Mrs Pierces hospitable
roof the girl after lingering awhile and going often to that nook in
the hill by Riverside took her departure She was restless yet clung
to the neighborhood It was with a wrench that she fixed her going when
I told her of my own journey back to the railroad In Buffalo she walked
to the courthouse and stood a moment as if bidding this site of one
lifememory farewell and from the stage she watched and watched the
receding town and mountains Its awful to be leaving him she said
Excuse me for acting so in front of you With the poignant emptiness
overcoming her in new guise she blamed herself for not waiting in
Illinois until he had been sent to Joliet for then so near home he
must have gone with her

How could I tell her that Nates death was the best end that could have
come to him But I said You know you dont think it was your fault
You know you would do the same again She listened to me but her eyes
had no interest in them He never knew pain I pursued and he died
doing the thing he liked best in the world He was happy and enjoying
himself and you gave him that Its bad only for you Some would talk
religion but I cant

Yes she answered I can think of him so glad to be free Thank you
for saying that about religion Do you think its wicked not to want
itto hate it sometimes I hope its not Thank you truly

During our journey she summoned her cheerfulness and all that she said
was wholesome In the robust coarse soundness of her fibre the
wounds of grief would heal and leave no sicknessperhaps no higher
sensitiveness to human sufferings than her broad native kindness already
held We touched upon religion again and my views shocked her Kentucky
notions for I told her Kentucky locked its religion in an iron cage
called Sunday which made it very savage and fond of biting strangers
Now and again I would run upon that vein of deepseated prejudice that
was in her character like some fine wire In short our disagreements
brought us to terms more familiar than we had reached hitherto But when
at last Separ came where was I There stood Mr McLean waiting and at
the suddenness of him she had no time to remember herself but stepped
out of the stage with such a smile that the ardent cowpuncher flushed
and beamed

So I went away without telling you goodbye he began not wisely
Mrs Pierce has been circulating war talk about me you bet

The maiden in Jessamine spoke instantly Indeed There was no special
obligation for you to call on me or her to notice if you didnt

Oh said Lin crestfallen Yu sure dont mean that

She looked at him and was compelled to melt No neighbor I dont
mean it

Neighbor he exclaimed and again Neighbor much pleased Now it
would sound kind o pleasant if youd call me that for a steady thing

It would sound kind of odd Mr McLean thank you

Blamed if I understand her cried Lin Blamed if I do But youre
going to understand me sure quick He rushed inside the station spoke
sharply to the agent and returned in the same tremor of elation that
had pushed him to forwardness with his girl and with which he seemed
near bursting Ive been here three days to meet you Theres a letter
and I expect I know whats in it Tubercle has got it here He took
it from the less hasty agent and thrust it in Jessamines hand You
neednt to fear Please open it its good news this time you bet
He watched it in her hand as the boy of eight watches the string of a
Christmas parcel he wishes his father would cut instead of so carefully
untie Open it he urged again Keeping me waiting this way

What in the world does all this mean cried Jessamine stopping short
at the first sentence

Read said Lin

Youve done this she exclaimed

Read read

So she read with big eyes It was an official letter of the railroad
written by the division superintendent at Edgeford It hoped Miss
Buckner might feel like taking the position of agent at Separ If she
was willing to consider this would she stop over at Edgeford on her
way east and talk with the superintendent In case the duties were more
than she had been accustomed to on the Louisville and Nashville she
could continue east with the loss of only a day The superintendent
believed the salary could be arranged satisfactorily Enclosed please to
find an order for a free ride to Edgeford

Jessamine turned her wondering eyes on Lin You did do this she
repeated but this time with extraordinary quietness

Yes said he And I am plumb proud of it

She gave a rich laugh of pleasure and amusement a long laugh and
stopped Did anybody ever she said

We can call each other neighbors now yu see said the cowpuncher

Oh no oh no Jessamine declared Though how am I ever to thank you

By not argufying Lin answered

Oh no no I can do no such thing Dont you see I cant I believe you
are crazy

Ive been waiting to hear yu say that said the complacent McLean
Im not argufying Well eat supper now The eastbound is due in an
hour and I expect youll be wanting to go on it

And I expect Ill go too said the girl

Ill be plumb proud to have yu the cowpuncher assented

Im going to get my ticket to Chicago right now said Jessamine again
laughing sunny and defiant

You bet you are said the incorrigible McLean He let her go into
the station serenely You cant get used to new ideas in a minute he
remarked to me Ive figured on all that of course But thats why
he broke out impetuously I quit you on Bear Creek so sudden When
she goes back away home Id been saying to myself every day whatll
you do then Lin McLean Well I knew Id go to Kentucky too Just
knew Id have to yu see and it was inconvenient turruble
inconvenientBilly here and my ranch and the beef roundup cominbut
how could I let her go and forget me Take up maybe with some
Bluegrass sonofagun back there And I hated the fix I was in till
that morning getting up I was joshin the Virginia man thats after
Miss Wood Id been sayin no educated lady would think of a man who
talked with an African accent Its repotted you have a Southern rival
yourself says he joshin back So I said I guessed the rival would
find life uneasy He does says he Any man with his voice broke in
two halves and one down in his stomach and one up among the angels is
goin to feel uneasy But Texas talks a heap about his lady vigilante in
the freightcar Vigilante I said and I must have jumped for they
all asked where the lightning had struck And in fifteen minutes after
writing you Id hit the trail for Separ Oh I figured things out on
that ride Mr McLean here clapped me on the back Got to Separ Got
the sheriffs addressthe sheriff that saw her that night they held up
the locomotive Got him to meet me at Edgeford and make a big talk to
the superintendent Made a big talk myself I said Put that girl in
charge of Separ and the boysll quit shooting your watertank But
Tubercle cant influence em Tubercle says the superintendent
Whats that And when I told him it was the agent he flapped his two
hands down on the chair arms each side of him and went to rockin up and
down I said the agent was just a temptation to the boys to be gay right
along and theyd keep ashooting You can choose between Tubercle and
your tank I said but youve got to move one of em from Separ if yu
went peace The sheriff backed me up good too He said a man couldnt
do much with Separ the way it was now but a decent woman would be
respected there and the only question was if she could conduct the
business So I spoke up about Shawhan and when the whole idea began to
soak into that superintendent his eyeballs jingled and he looked as wise
as a workox Ill see her says he And hes going to see her

Well said I you deserve success after thinking of a thing like
that Youre wholly wasted punching cattle But shes going to Chicago
By eleven oclock she will have passed by your superintendent

Why so she will said Lin affecting surprise

He baffled me and he baffled Jessamine Indeed his eagerness with her
parcels his assistance in checking her trunk his cheerful examination
of check and ticket to be sure they read over the same route plainly
failed to gratify her

Her firmness about going was sincere but she had looked for more
dissuasion and this sprightly abettal of her departure seemed to leave
something vacant in the ceremonies She fell singularly taciturn during
supper at the Hotel Brunswick and presently observed I hope I shall
see Mr Donohoe

Texas said Lin I expect theyll have tucked him in bed by now up at
the ranch The little fellow is growing yet

He can walk round a freightcar all night said Miss Buckner stoutly
Ive always wanted to thank him for looking after me

Mr McLean smiled elaborately at his plate

Well if hes not actually thinking hell tease me cried out
Jessamine Though he claims not to be foolish like Mr Donohoe Why
Mr McLean you surely must have been young once See if you cant
remember

Shucks began Lin

But her laughter routed him Maybe you didnt notice you were young
she said But dont you reckon perhaps the men around did Why maybe
even the girls kind o did

Shes hard to beat aint she inquired Lin admiringly of me

In my opinion she was She had her wish too about Texas for we found
him waiting on the railroad platform dressed in his best to say
goodbye The friendly things she told him left him shuffling and
repeating that it was a mistake to go a big mistake but when she said
the butter was not good enough his laugh cracked joyously up into the
treble The trains arrival brought quick sadness to her face but she
made herself bright again with a special farewell for each acquaintance

Dont you ride any more cowcatchers she warned Billy Lusk or Ill
have to come back and look after you

You said you and me were going for a ride and we aint shouted
the longmemoried nineyearold You will murmured Mr McLean
oracularly

As the trains pace quickened he did not step off and Miss Buckner
cried Jump

Too late said he placidly Then he called to me Im hard to beat
too So the train took them both away as I might have guessed was his
intention all along

Is that marriage again said Billy anxiously He wouldnt tell me
nothing

Hes just seeing Miss Buckner as far as Edgeford said the agent Be
back tomorrow

Then I dont see why he wouldnt take me along Billy complained And
Separ laughed

But the lover was not back tomorrow He was capable of anything gossip
remarked and took up new themes The sun rose and set the two trains
made their daily slight event and gathering the watertank glaring
bulkily in the sun beaconed unmolested and the agents natural sleep
was unbroken by pistols for the cowboys did not happen to be in town
Separ lay a clot of torpor that I was glad to leave behind me for a
while But news is a strange permeating substance and it began to be
sifted through the air that Tubercle was going to Gods country

That is how they phrased it in cowcamp meaning not the next world but
the Eastern States

Its certainly a shame him leaving after weve got him so good and used
to us said the Virginian

We cant tell him goodbye said Honey Wiggin Separll be slow

We can give his successor a right hearty welcome the Virginian
suggested

Thats you said Honey Schemin mischief away ahead Youre
the leadin devil in this country and just because yu wear a
faithfullooking face youre tryin to fool a poor schoolmarm

Yes drawled the Southerner thats what Im aiming to do

So now they were curious about the successor planning their hearty
welcome for that official and were encouraged in this by Mr McLean
He reappeared in the neighborhood with a manner and conversation highly
casual

Bring your new wife they inquired

No she preferred Kentucky Lin said

Bring the old one

No she preferred Laramie

Kentuckys a right smart way to chase after a girl said the
Virginian

Sure said Mr McLean I quit at Edgeford

He met their few remarks so smoothly that they got no joy from him and
being asked had he seen the new agent he answered yes that Tubercle
had gone Wednesday and his successor did not seem to be much of a man

But to me Lin had nothing to say until noon camp was scattering from
its lunch to work when he passed close and whispered Youll see her
tomorrow if you go in with the outfit Then looking round to
make sure we were alone in the sagebrush he drew from his pocket
cherishingly a little shining pistol Hers said he simply

I looked at him

Weve exchanged he said

He turned the token in his hand caressing it as on that first night
when Jessamine had taken his heart captive

My idea he added unable to lift his eyes from the treasure See
this too

I looked and there was the word Neighbor engraved on it

Her idea said he

A good one I murmured

Its on both yu know We had it put on the day she settled to accept
the superintendents proposition Here Lin fired his small exchanged
weapon at a cottonwood striking low She can beat that with mine he
exclaimed proud and tender She took four days deciding at Edgeford
and I learned her to hit the ace of clubs He showed me the cards they
had practiced upon during those four days of indecision he had them in
a book as if they were pressed flowers They wont get crumpled that
way said he and he further showed me a tintype Shes got the other
at Separ he finished

I shook his hand with all my might Yes he was worthy of her Yes he
deserved this smooth course his love was running And I shook his hand
again To tonic her grief Jessamine had longed for some activity some
work and he had shown her Wyoming might hold this for her as well as
Kentucky But how in the world I asked him did you persuade her to
stop over at Edgeford at all

Yu mustnt forget said the lover and he blushed that I had her
four hours alone on the train

But his face that evening round the fire when they talked of their next
days welcome to the new agent became comedy of the highest and he was
so desperately canny in the moments he chose for silence or for comment
He had not been sure of their ignorance until he arrived and it was
a joke with him too deep for laughter He had a special eye upon the
Virginian his mate in such a tale of mischiefs and now he led him on
He suggested to the Southerner that caution might be wise this change
at Separ was perhaps some new trick of the companys

We mostly take their tricks observed the Virginian

Yes said Lin nodding sagely at the fire thats so too

Yet not he not any one could have foreseen the mortifying harmlessness
of the outcome They swept down upon Separ like all the hordes of
legendmore egregiously perhaps because they were playacting and
no serious horde would go on so Our final hundred yards of speed and
copious howling brought all dwellers in Separ out to gaze and disappear
like rabbitsall save the new agent in the station Nobody ran out or
in there and the horde whirled up to the tiny defenceless building and
leaped to earthexcept Lin and me we sat watching The innocent door
stood open wide to any cool breeze or invasion and Honey Wiggin tramped
in foremost hat lowering over eyes and pistol prominent He stopped
rooted staring and his mouth came open slowly his hand went feeling
up for his hat and came down with it by degrees as by degrees his
grin spread Then in a milky voice he said Why excuse me maam
Goodmorning

There answered a clear long rippling ample laugh It came out of the
open door into the heat it made the sunbaked air merry it seemed to
welcome and mock it genially hovered about us in the dusty quiet of
Separ for there was no other sound anywhere at all in the place
and the great plain stretched away silent all round it The bulging
watertank shone overhead in bland ironic safety

The horde stood blank then it shifted its legs looked sideways at
itself and in a hesitating clump reached the door shambled in and
removed its foolish hat

Goodmorning gentlemen said Jessamine Buckner seated behind her
railing and various voices endeavored to reply conventionally

If you have any letters maam said the Virginian more inventive
Ill take them Letters for Judge Henrys He knew the judges office
was seventy miles from here

Any for the C Y muttered another likewise knowing better

It was a happy if simple thought and most of them inquired for the
mail Jessamine sought carefully making them repeat their names which
some did guiltily they foresaw how soon the lady would find out no
letters ever came for these names

There was no letter for any one present

Im sorry truly said Jessamine behind the railing For you seemed
real anxious to get news Better luck next time And if I make mistakes
please everybody set me straight for of course I dont understand
things yet

Yes mm

Goodday mm

Thank yu mm

They got themselves out of the station and into their saddles

No she dont understand things yet soliloquized the Virginian Oh
dear no He turned his slow dark eyes upon us You Lin McLean said
he in his gentle voice you have certnly fooled me plumb through this
mawnin

Then the horde rode out of town chastened and orderly till it was quite
small across the sagebrush when reaction seized it It sped suddenly
and vanished in dust with far hilarious cries and here were Lin and I
and here towered the watertank shining and shining

Thus did Separs vigilante take possession and vindicate Lins knowledge
of his kind It was not three days until the Virginian that lynx
observer fixed his grave eyes upon McLean Neighbor is as cute a name
for a sixshooter as ever I heard said he But shell never have need
of your gun in Separonly to shoot up peaceful playincyards while she
hearkens to your courtin

That was his way of congratulation to a brother lover Plumb strange
he said to me one morning after an hour of riding in silence how a man
will win two women while another man gets aged waitin for one

Your hair seems black as ever said I

My hopes aint so glossy any more he answered Lin has done better
this second trip

Mrs Lusk dont count said I

I reckon she counted mighty plentiful when he thought hed got her
clamped to him by lawful marriage But Lins lucky And the Virginian
fell silent again

Lucky Lin bestirred him over his work his plans his ranch on Box Elder
that was one day to be a home for his lady He came and went seeing his
idea triumph and his girl respected Not only was she a girl but a
good shot too And as if she and her small neat home were a sort of
possession the cowpunchers would boast of her to strangers They
would have dealt heavily now with the wretch who should trifle with the
watertank When camp came within visiting distance you would see one
or another shaving and parting his hair They wrote unnecessary letters
and brought them to mail as excuses for an afternoon call Honey Wiggin
more original would look in the door with his grin and hold up an
ace of clubs I thought maybe yu could spare a minute for a
shootinmatch he would insinuate and Separ now heard no more
objectionable shooting than this Texas brought her presents of
gameantelope sagechickensbut shyness intervening he left them
outside the door and entering dressed in all the Sunday that he had
would sit dumbly in the ladys presence I remember his emerging
from one of these placid interviews straight into the hands of his
tormentors

If she dont notice your clothes Texas said the Virginian just
mention them to her

Now yerve done offended her shrilled Manassas Donohoe She heard
that

Shell hear you singin sooprano said Honey Wiggin Its good this
country has reformed or theyd have you warblin in some dancehall and
corrupt your morals

You scacely can corrupt the morals of a soprano man observed the
Virginian Go and play with Billy till you can talk bass

But it was the boldest adults that Billy chose for playmates Texas he
found immature Moreover when next he came he desired play with no
one Summer was done Septembers full moon was several nights ago he
had gone on his hunt with Lin and now spellingbooks were at hand But
more than this clouded his mind he had been brought to say goodbye
to Jessamine Buckner who had scarcely seen him and to give her a
wolvereneskin a hunting trophy She can have it he told me I like
her Then he stole a look at his guardian If they get married and
send me back to mother said he Ill run away sure So school and
this old dread haunted the child while for the man Lin the lucky
who suspected nothing of it time was ever bringing love nearer to his
hearth His Jessamine had visited Box Elder and even said she wanted
chickens there since when Mr McLean might occasionally have been seen
at his cabin worrying over barnyard fowls feeding and cursing them
with equal care Spring would see him married he told me

This time right he exclaimed And I want her to know Billy some more
before he goes to Bear Creek

Ah Bear Creek said Billy acidly Why cant I stay home

Home sounds kind o slick said Lin to me Dont it now Home is
closer than neighbor you bet Billy put the horses in the corral
and ask Miss Buckner if we can come and see her after supper If youre
good maybe shell take yu for a ride tomorrow And kid ask her
about Laramie

Again suspicion quivered over Billys face and he dragged his horses
angrily to the corral

Lin nudged me laughing I can rile him every time about Laramie said
he affectionately I wouldnt have believed the kid set so much store
by me Nor I didnt need to ask Jessamine to love him for my sake What
do yu suppose Before Id got far as thinking of Billy at allright
after Edgeford when my head was just a whirl of joyJessamine says to
me one day Read that It was Governor Barker writin to her about her
brother and her sorrow Lin paused And about me I cant never tell
youbut he said a heap I didnt deserve And he told her about me
picking up Billy in Denver streets that time and doing for him because
his own home was not a good one Governor Barker wrote Jessamine all
that and she said Why did you never tell me And I said it wasnt
anything to tell And she just said to me It shall be as if he was
your son and I was his mother And thats the first regular kiss she
ever gave me I didnt have to take myself God bless her God bless
her

As we ate our supper young Billy burst out of brooding silence I
didnt ask her about Laramie So there

Well well kid said the cowpuncher patting his head yu neednt
to I guess

But Billys eye remained sullen and jealous He paid slight attention
to the picturebook of soldiers and war that Jessamine gave him when we
went over to the station She had her own books some flowers in pots
a rockingchair and a cosey lamp that shone on her bright face and dark
dress We drew stools from the office desks and Billy perched silently
on one

Scanty room for company Jessamine said But we must make out this
waytill we have another way She smiled on Lin and Billys face
darkened Do you know she pursued to me with all those chickens Mr
McLean tells me about never a one has he thought to bring here

Livin or dead do you want em inquired Lin

Oh Ill not bother you Mr Donohoe says he will

Texas Chickens Him Then hell have to steal em And we all laughed
together

You wont make me go back to Laramie will you spoke Billy suddenly
from his stool

Id like to see anybody try to make you exclaimed Jessamine Who
says any such thing

Lin did said Billy

Jessamine looked at her lover reproachfully What a way to tease him
she said And you so kind Why youve hurt his feelings

I never thought said Lin the boisterous I wouldnt have

Come sit here Billy said Jessamine Whenever he teases you tell
me and well make him behave

Honest persisted Billy

Shake hands on it said Jessamine

Cause Ill go to school But I wont go back to Laramie for no one And
youre agoing to be Lins wife honest

Honest Honest And Jessamine laughing grew red beside her lamp

Then I guess mother cant never come back to Lin either stated
Billy relieved

Jessamine let fall the childs hand

Cause she liked him onced and he liked her

Jessamine gazed at Lin

Its simple said the cowpuncher Its all right

But Jessamine sat by her lamp very pale

Its all right repeated Lin in the silence shifting his foot and
looking down Once I made a fool of myself Worse than usual

Billy whispered Jessamine Then youBut his name is Lusk

Course it is said Billy Father and mother are living in Laramie

Its all straight said the cowpuncher I never saw her till three
years ago I havent anything to hide onlyonlyonly it dont come
easy to tell

I rose Miss Buckner said I he will tell you But he will not tell
you he paid dearly for what was no fault of his It has been no secret
It is only something his friends and his enemies have forgotten

But all the while I was speaking this Jessamines eyes were fixed on
Lin and her face remained white

I left the girl and the man and the little boy together and crossed to
the hotel But its air was foul and I got my roll of camp blankets
to sleep in the clean night if sleepingtime should come meanwhile
I walked about in the silence To have taken a wife once in good faith
ignorant she was anothers left no stain raised no barrier I could
have told Jessamine the same old story myselfor almost but what had
it to do with her at all Why need she know Reasoning thus yet with
something left uncleared by reason that I could not state I watched
the moon edge into sight heavy and richhued a melonslice of glow
seemingly near like a great lantern tilted over the plain The smell of
the sagebrush flavored the air the hush of Wyoming folded distant and
near things and all Separ but those three inside the lighted window
were in bed Dark windows were everywhere else and looming above rose
the watertank a dull mass in the night and forever somehow to me a
Sphinx emblem the vision I instantly see when I think of Separ Soon I
heard a door creaking It was Billy coming alone and on seeing me he
walked up and spoke in a halfawed voice

Shes acrying said he

I withheld from questions and as he kept along by my side he said Im
sorry Do you think shes mad with Lin for what hes told her She just
sat and when she started crying he made me go away

I dont believe shes mad I told Billy and I sat down on my blanket
he beside me talking while the moon grew small as it rose over the
plain and the light steadily shone in Jessamines window Soon young
Billy fell asleep and I looked at him thinking how in a way it was he
who had brought this trouble on the man who had saved him and loved him
But that man had no such untender thoughts Once more the door opened
and it was he who came this time alone also She did not follow him
and stand to watch him from the threshold though he forgot to close the
door and coming over to me stood looking down

What I said at length

I dont know that he heard me He stooped over Billy and shook him
gently Wake son said he You and I must get to our camp now

Now said Billy Cant we wait till morning

No son We cant wait here any more Go and get the horses and put the
saddles on As Billy obeyed Lin looked at the lighted window She is
in there he said Shes in there So near He looked and turned to
the hotel from which he brought his chaps and spurs and put them on
I understand her words he continued Her words the meaning of them
But not what she means I guess It will take studyin over Why she
dont blame me he suddenly said speaking to me instead of to himself

Lin I answered she has only just heard this you see Wait awhile

Thats not the trouble She knows what kind of man I have been and
she forgives that just the way she did her brother And she knows how I
didnt intentionally conceal anything Billy hasnt been around and
she never realized about his mother and me Weve talked awful open
but that was not pleasant to speak of and the whole country knew it so
longand I never thought She dont blame me She says she understands
but she says I have a wife livin

That is nonsense I declared

Yu mustnt say that said he She dont claim shes a wife either
She just shakes her head when I asked her why she feels so It must be
different to you and me from the way it seems to her I dont see her
view maybe I never can see it but shes made me feel she has it and
that shes honest and loves me true His voice broke for a moment
She said shed wait

You cant have a marriage broken that was never tied I said But
perhaps Governor Barker or Judge Henry

No said the cowpuncher Law couldnt fool her Shes thinking of
something back of law She said shed waitalways And when I took it
in that this was all over and done and when I thought of my ranch and
the chickenswell I couldnt think of things at all and I came and
waked Billy to clear out and quit

What did you tell her I asked

Tell her Nothin I guess I dont remember getting out of the room
Why heres actually her pistol and shes got mine

Man man said I go back and tell her to keep it and that youll
wait tooalways

Would yu

Look I pointed to Jessamine standing in the door

I saw his face as he turned to her and I walked toward Billy and the
horses Presently I heard steps on the wooden station and from its
black brief shadow the two came walking Lin and his sweetheart into
the moonlight They were not speaking but merely walked together in
the clear radiance hand in hand like two children I saw that she
was weeping and that beneath the tyranny of her resolution her whole
loving ample nature was wrung But the strange narrow fibre in her
would not yield I saw them go to the horses and Jessamine stood while
Billy and Lin mounted Then quickly the cowpuncher sprang down again
and folded her in his arms

Lin dear Lin dear neighbor she sobbed She could not withhold this
last goodbye

I do not think he spoke In a moment the horses started and were gone
flying rushing away into the great plain until sight and sound of them
were lost and only the sagebrush was there bathed in the high bright
moon The last thing I remember as I lay in my blankets was Jessamines
window still lighted and the watertank clearlined and black
standing over Separ





DESTINY AT DRYBONE



PART I

Children have many special endowments and of these the chiefest is to
ask questions that their elders must skirmish to evade Married people
and aunts and uncles commonly discover this but mere instinct does not
guide one to it A maiden of twentythree will not necessarily divine
it Now except in one unhappy hour of stress and surprise Miss
Jessamine Buckner had been more than equal to life thus far But never
yet had she been shut up a whole day in one room with a boy of nine
Had this experience been hers perhaps she would not have written to Mr
McLean the friendly and singular letter in which she hoped he was well
and said that she was very well and how was dear little Billy She
was glad Mr McLean had stayed away That was just like his honorable
nature and what she expected of him And she was perfectly happy at
Separ and yours sincerely and always Neighbor Postscript Talking
of Billy Luskif Lin was busy with gathering the cattle why not send
Billy down to stop quietly with her She would make him a bed in the
ticketoffice and there she would be to see after him all the time She
knew Lin did not like his adopted child to be too much in cowcamp with
the men She would adopt him too for just as long as convenient to
Linuntil the school opened on Bear Creek if Lin so wished Jessamine
wrote a good deal about how much better care any woman can take of a boy
of Billys age than any man knows The stagecoach brought the answer
to this remarkably soonyoung Billy with a trunk and a letter of twelve
pages in pencil and inkthe only writing of this length ever done by
Mr McLean

I can write a lot quicker than Lin said Billy upon arriving He was
fussing at that away late by the fire in camp an waked me up crawling
in our bed An then he had to finish it next night when he went over to
the cabin for my clothes

You dont say said Jessamine And Billy suffered her to kiss him
again

When not otherwise occupied Jessamine took the letter out of its locked
box and read it or looked at it Thus the first days had gone finely
at Separ the weather being beautiful and Billy much outofdoors
But sometimes the weather changes in Wyoming and now it was that Miss
Jessamine learned the talents of childhood

Soon after breakfast this stormy morning Billy observed the twelve pages
being taken out of their box and spoke from his sudden brain Honey
Wiggin says Lins losing his grip about girls he remarked He says
you couldnt a downed him onced Youd a had to marry him Honey
says Lin aint worked it like he done in old times

Now I shouldnt wonder if he was right said Jessamine buoyantly
And that being the case Im going to set to work at your things till
it clears and then well go for our ride

Yes said Billy When does a man get too old to marry

Im only a girl you see I dont know

Yes Honey said he wouldnt a thought Lin was that old But I guess
he must be thirty

Old exclaimed Jessamine And she looked at a photograph upon her
table

But Lin aint been married very much pursued Billy Mothers the
only one they speak of You dont have to stay married always do you

Its better to said Jessamine

Ah I dont think so said Billy with disparagement You ought to
see mother and father I wish you would leave Lin marry you though
said the boy coming to her with an impulse of affection Why wont you
if he dont mind

She continued to parry him but this was not a very smooth start for
eight in the morning Moments of lull there were when the telegraph
called her to the front room and Billys young mind shifted to
inquiries about the cipher alphabet And she gained at least an hour
teaching him to read various words by the sound At dinner too he was
refreshingly silent But such silences are unsafe and the weather was
still bad Four oclock found them much where they had been at eight

Please tell me why you wont leave Lin marry you He was at the
window kicking the wall

Thats nine times since dinner she replied with tireless good humor
Now if you ask me twelve

Youll tell said the boy swiftly

She broke into a laugh No Ill go riding and youll stay at home
When I was little and would ask things beyond me they only gave me
three times

Ive got two more anyway Haha

Better save em up though

What did they do to you Ah I dont want to go ariding Its nasty
all over He stared out at the day against which Separs doors had been
tight closed since morning Eight hours of furious wind had raised the
dust like a sea I wish the old train would come observed Billy
continuing to kick the wall I wish I was going somewheres Smoky
level and hot the south wind leapt into Separ across five hundred
unbroken miles The plain was blanketed in a tawny eclipse Each minute
the near buildings became invisible in a turbulent herd of clouds Above
this travelling blur of the soil the top of the watertank alone rose
bulging into the clear sun The sand spirals would lick like flames
along the bulk of the lofty tub and soar skyward It was not shipping
season The freightcars stood idle in a long line No cattle huddled in
the corrals No strangers moved in town No cowponies dozed in front of
the saloon Their riders were distant in ranch and camp Human noise was
extinct in Separ Beneath the thunder of the sultry blasts the place
lay dead in its flapping shroud of dust Why wont you tell me droned
Billy For some time he had been returning like a mosquito brushed
away

Thats ten times said Jessamine promptly

Oh goodness Pretty soon Ill not be glad I came Im about twiced as
less glad now

Well said Jessamine theres a man coming today to mend the
government telegraphline between Drybone and McKinney Maybe he would
take you back as far as Box Elder if you want to go very much Shall I
ask him

Billy was disappointed at this cordial seconding of his mood He did not
make a direct rejoinder I guess Ill go outside now said he with a
threat in his tone

She continued mending his stockings Finished ones lay rolled at one
side of her chair and upon the other were more waiting her attention

And Im going to turn back handsprings on top of all the
freightcars he stated more loudly

She indulged again in merriment laughing sweetly at him and without
restraint

And Im sick of what you all keep asaying to me he shouted Just as
if I was a baby

Why Billy who ever said you were a baby

All of you do Honey and Lin and you now and everybody What makes
you say thats nine times Billy oh Billy thats ten times if you
dont mean Im a baby And you laugh me off just like they do and just
like I was a regular baby You wont tell me

Billy listen Did nobody ever ask you something you did not want to
tell them

Thats not a bit the same becausebecausebecause I treat em square
and because its not their business But every time I ask anybody most
anything they say Im not old enough to understand and Ill be ten
soon And it is my business when its about the kind of a mother Im
agoing to have Suppose I quit acting square an told em when they
bothered me they werent young enough to understand Wish I had Guess
I will too and watch em step around For a moment his mind dwelt
upon this and he whistled a revengeful strain

Goodness Billy said Jessamine at the sight of the next stocking
The whole heel is scorched off

He eyed the ruin with indifference Ah that was last month when I
and Lin shot the bear in the swamp willows He made me dry off my legs
Chuck it away

And spoil the pair No indeed

Mother always chucked em an fatherd buy new ones till I skipped
from home Lin kind o mends em

Does he said Jessamine softly And she looked at the photograph

Yes What made you write him for to let me come and bring my stockins
and things

Dont you see Billy there is so little work at this station that Id
be looking out of the window all day just the pitiful way you do

Oh Billy pondered And so I said to Lin he continued why didnt
he send down his own clothes too an let you fix em all And Honey
Wiggin laughed right in his coffeecup so it all sploshed out And the
cook he asked me if mother used to mend Lins clothes But I guess she
chucked em like she always did fathers and mine I was with father
you know when mother was married to Lin that time He paused again
while his thoughts and fears struggled But Lin says I neednt ever
go back he went on reasoning and confiding to her Lin dont like
mother any more I guess His pondering grew still deeper and he
looked at Jessamine for some while Then his face wakened with a new
theory Dont Lin like you any more he inquired

Oh cried Jessamine crimsoning yes Why he sent you to me

Well he got hot in camp when I said that about sending his clothes to
you He quit supper pretty soon and went away off a walking And thats
another time they said I was too young But Lin dont come to see you
any more

Why I hope he loves me murmured Jessamine Always

Well I hope so too said Billy earnestly For I like you When I
seen him show you our cabin on Box Elder and the room he had fixed
for you I was glad you were coming to be my mother Mother used to be
awful I wouldnt a minded her licking me if shed done other things
Ah pshaw I wasnt going to stand that Billy now came close to
Jessamine I do wish you would come and live with me and Lin said he
Lins awful nice

Dont I know it said Jessamine tenderly

Cause I heard you say you were going to marry him went on Billy
And I seen him kiss you and you let him that time we went away when you
found out about mother And youre not mad and hes not and nothing
happens at all all the same Wont you tell me please

Jessamines eyes were glistening and she took him in her lap She was
not going to tell him that he was too young this time But whatever
things she had shaped to say to the boy were never said

Through the noise of the gale came the steadier sound of the train
and the girl rose quickly to preside over her ticketoffice and duties
behind the railing in the front room of the station The boy ran to the
window to watch the great event of Separs day The locomotive loomed
out from the yellow clots of drift paused at the watertank and then
with steam and humming came slowly on by the platform Slowly its long
dustchoked train emerged trundling behind it and ponderously halted
There was no one to go No one came to buy a ticket of Jessamine The
conductor looked in on business but she had no telegraphic orders
for him The express agent jumped off and looked in for pleasure He
received his daily smile and nod of friendly discouragement Then the
light bundle of mail was flung inside the door Separ had no mail to
go out As she was picking up the letters young Billy passed her like a
shadow and fled out Two passengers had descended from the train a man
and a large woman His clothes were loose and careless upon him He held
valises and stood uncertainly looking about him in the storm Her
firm heavy body was closely dressed In her hat was a large handsome
feather Along between the several cars brakemen leaned out watched
her and grinned to each other But her big hardshining blue eyes were
fixed curiously upon the station where Jessamine was

Its all night we may be here is it she said to the man harshly

How am I to help that he retorted

Ill help it If this hotels the sty it used to be Ill walk to
Tommys Ive not saw him since I left Bear Creek

She stalked into the hotel while the man went slowly to the station He
entered and found Jessamine behind her railing sorting the slim mail

Goodevening he said Excuse me There was to be a wagon sent here

For the telegraphmender Yes sir It came Tuesday Youre to find the
polewagon at Drybone

This news was good and all that he wished to know He could drive out
and escape a night at the Hotel Brunswick But he lingered because
Jessamine spoke so pleasantly to him He had heard of her also

Governor Barker has not been around here he said

Not yet sir We understand he is expected through on a huntingtrip

I suppose there is room for two and a trunk on that wagon

I reckon so sir Jessamine glanced at the man and he took himself
out Most men took themselves out if Jessamine so willed and it was
mostly achieved thus in amity

On the platform the man found his wife again

Then I neednt to walk to Tommys she said And well eat as we
travel But youll wait till Im through with her She made a gesture
toward the station

Whywhywhat do you want with her Dont you know who she is

It was me told you who she was James Lusk Youll wait till Ive been
and asked her after Lin McLeans health and till Ive saw how the likes
of her talks to the likes of me

He made a feeble protest that this would do no one any good

Sew yourself up James Lusk If it has been your idea I come with yus
clear from Laramie to watch yus plant telegraphpoles in the sagebrush
why youre off I aint heard much o Lin since the day he learned it
was you and not him that was my husband And Ive come back in this
country to have a look at my old friendsand she laughed loudly and
nodded at the station my old friends new friends

Thus ordered the husband wandered away to find his wagon and the horse

Jessamine in the office had finished her station duties and returned
to her needle She sat contemplating the scorched sock of Billys and
heard a heavy step at the threshold She turned and there was the
large woman with the feather quietly surveying her The words which the
stranger spoke then were usual enough for a beginning But there was
something of threat in the strong animal countenance something of
laughter ready to break out Much beauty of its kind had evidently been
in the face and now as substitute for what was gone was the brag
look of assertion that it was still all there Many stranded travellers
knocked at Jessamines door and now as always she offered the
hospitalities of her neat abode the only room in Separ fit for a woman
As she spoke and the guest surveyed and listened the door blew shut
with a crash

Outside in a shed Billy had placed the wagon between himself and his
father

How you have grown the man was saying and he smiled Come shake
hands I did not think to see you here

Dare you to touch me Billy screamed No Ill never come with you
Lin says I neednt to

The man passed his hand across his forehead and leaned against the
wheel Lord Lord he muttered

His son warily slid out of the shed and left him leaning there



PART II

Lin McLean bachelor sat out in front of his cabin looking at a small
bright pistol that lay in his hand He held it tenderly cherishing it
and did not cease slowly to polish it Revery filled his eyes and in
his whole face was sadness unmasked because only the animals were
there to perceive his true feelings Sunlight and waving shadows moved
together upon the green of his pasture cattle and horses loitered
in the opens by the stream Down Box Elders course its valley and
goldenchimneyed bluffs widened away into the level and the blue of the
greater valley Upstream the branches and shining quiet leaves entered
the mountains where the rock chimneys narrowed to a gateway a citadel
of shafts and turrets crimson and gold above the filmy emerald of the
trees Through there the road went up from the cottonwoods into the
cool quaking asps and pines and so across the range and away to Separ
Along the ridgepole of the new stable two hundred yards downstream
sat McLeans turkeys and cocks and hens walked in front of him here by
his cabin and fenced garden Slow smoke rose from the cabins chimney
into the air in which were no sounds but the running water and the
afternoon chirp of birds Amid this framework of a home the cowpuncher
sat lonely inattentive polishing the treasured weapon as if it were
not already long clean His target stood some twenty steps in front of
hima small cottonwoodtree its trunk chipped and honeycombed with
bullets which he had fired into it each day for memorys sake Presently
he lifted the pistol and looked at its namethe word Neighbor
engraved upon it

I wonder said he aloud if she keeps the rust off mine Then he
lifted it slowly to his lips and kissed the word Neighbor

The clank of wheels sounded on the road and he put the pistol quickly
down Dreaminess vanished from his face He looked around alertly but
no one had seen him The clanking was still among the trees a little
distance up Box Elder It approached deliberately while he watched for
the vehicle to emerge upon the open where his cabin stood and then they
came a man and a woman At sight of her Mr McLean half rose but sat
down again Neither of them had noticed him sitting as they were in
silence and the drowsiness of a long drive The man was weakfaced with
good looks sallowed by dissipation and a vanquished glance of the
eye As the woman had stood on the platform at Separ so she sat now
upright bold and massive The brag of past beauty was a habit settled
upon her stolid features Both sat inattentive to each other and to
everything around them The wheels turned slowly and with a dry dead
noise the reins bellied loosely to the shafts the horses head hung
low So they drew close Then the man saw McLean and color came into
his face and went away

Goodevening said he clearing his throat We heard you was in
cowcamp

The cowpuncher noted how he tried to smile and a freakish change
crossed his own countenance He nodded slightly and stretched his legs
out as he sat

You look natural said the woman familiarly

Seem to be fixed nice here continued the man Hadnt heard of it
Well well be going along Glad to have seen you

Your wheel wants greasing said McLean briefly his eye upon the man

Cant stop I expect shell last to Drybone Goodevening

Stay to supper said McLean always seated on his chair

Cant stop thank you I expect we can last to Drybone He twitched
the reins

McLean levelled a pistol at a chicken and knocked off its head Better
stay to supper he suggested very distinctly

Its business I tell you Ive got to catch Governor Barker before
he

The pistol cracked and a second chicken shuffled in the dust Better
stay to supper drawled McLean

The man looked up at his wife

So yus need me she broke out Aint got heart enough in yer
playedout body to stand up to a man Well eat here Get down

The husband stepped to the ground I didnt suppose youd want

Ho want Whats Lin or you or anything to me Help me out

Both men came forward She descended leaning heavily upon each her
blue staring eyes fixed upon the cowpuncher

No yus aint changed she said Same in your looks and same in your
actions Was you expecting you could scare me you Lin McLean

I just wanted chickens for supper said he

Mrs Lusk gave a hard high laugh Ill eat em Its not I that cares
As for She stopped Her eye had fallen upon the pistol and the name
Neighbor As for you she continued to Mr Lusk dont you be
standing dumb same as the horse

Better take him to the stable Lusk said McLean

He picked the chickens up showed the woman to the best chair in his
room and went into his kitchen to cook supper for three He gave his
guests no further attention nor did either of them come in where he
was nor did the husband rejoin the wife He walked slowly up and down
in the air and she sat by herself in the room Lins steps as he
made ready round the stove and table and Lusks slow tread out in the
setting sunlight were the only sounds about the cabin When the host
looked into the door of the next room to announce that his meal was
served the woman sat in her chair no longer but stood with her back
to him by a shelf She gave a slight start at his summons and replaced
something He saw that she had been examining Neighbor and his face
hardened suddenly to fierceness as he looked at her but he repeated
quietly that she had better come in Thus did the three sit down to
their meal Occasionally a word about handing some dish fell from one
or other of them but nothing more until Lusk took out his watch and
mentioned the hour

Yuve not ate especially hearty said Lin resting his arms upon the
table

Im going asserted Lusk Governor Barker may start out Ive got my
interests to look after

Why sure said Lin I cant hope youll waste all your time on just
me

Lusk rose and looked at his wife Itll be ten now before we get to
Drybone said he And he went down to the stable

The woman sat still pressing the crumbs of her bread I know you seen
me she said without looking at him

Saw you when

I knowed it And I seen how you looked at me She sat twisting and
pressing the crumb Sometimes it was round sometimes it was a cube now
and then she flattened it to a disk Mr McLean seemed to have nothing
that he wished to reply

If you claim that pistol is yourn she said next Ill tell you I
know better If you ask me whose should it be if not yourn I would not
have to guess the name She has talked to me and me to her

She was still looking away from him at the breadcrumb or she could
have seen that McLeans hand was trembling as he watched her leaning on
his arms

Oh yes she was willing to talk to me The woman uttered another
sudden laugh I knowed about herall Things get heard of in this
world Did not all about you and me come to her knowledge in its own
good time and it done and gone how many years My my my Her voice
grew slow and absent She stopped for a moment and then more rapidly
resumed It had travelled around about you and her like it always will
travel It was known how you had asked her and how she had told you she
would have you and then told you she would not when she learned about
you and me Folks that knowed yus and folks that never seen yus in their
lives had to have their word about her facing you down you had another
wife though she knowed the truth about me being married to Lusk and him
livin the day you married me and ten and twenty marriages could
not have tied you and me up no matter how honest you swore to no
hinderance Folks said it was plain she did not want yus It give me
a queer feelin to see that girl It give me a wish to tell her to her
face that she did not love yus and did not know love Waitwait Lin
Yu never hit me yet

No said the cowpuncher Nor now Im not Lusk

Yu looked soso bad Lin I never seen yu look so bad in old days
Wait now and I must tell it I wished to laugh in her face and say
What do you know about love So I walked in Lin she does love yus

Yes breathed McLean

She was sittin back in her room at Separ Not the ticketoffice
but

I know the cowpuncher said His eyes were burning

Its snug the way she has it Goodafternoon I says Is this Miss
Jessamine Buckner

At his sweethearts name the glow in Lins eyes seemed to quiver to a
flash

And she spoke pleasant to mepleasant and gaylike But a woman can
tell sorrow in a womans eyes And she asked me would I rest in her room
there and what was my name They tell me you claim to know it better
than I do I says They tell me you say it is Mrs McLean She
put her hand on her breast and she keeps lookin at me without never
speaking Maybe I am not so welcome now I says One minute says
she Let me get used to it And she sat down

Lin she is a squarelookin girl Ill say that for her

I never thought to sit down onced myself I dont know why but I kep
astanding and I took in that room of hers She had flowers and things
around there and I seen your picture standing on the table and I seen
your sixshooter right by itand oh Lin hadnt I knowed your face
before ever she did and that gun you used to let me shoot on Bear
Creek It took me that sudden Why it rushed over me so I spoke right
out different from what Id meant and what I had ready fixed up to say

Why did you do it I says to her while she was asitting How could
you act so and you a woman She just sat and her sad eyes made me
madder at the idea of her You have had real sorrow says I if they
report correct You have knowed your share of death and misery and
hard work and all Great God aint there things enough that come to
yus uncalled for and natural but you must run around huntin up more
that was leavin yus alone and givin yus a chance I knowed him onced
I knowed your Lin McLean And when that was over I knowed for the first
time how men can be different Im started Lin Im started Leave me
go on and when Im through Ill quit Some of em anyway I says to
her has hearts and selfrespect and aint hogs clean through

I know she says thoughtfullike

And at her whispering that way I gets madder

You know I says then What is it that you know Do you know that
you have hurt a good mans heart For onced I hurt it myself though
different And hurts in them kind of hearts stays Some hearts is that
luscious and pasty you can stab em and it closes up so yud never
suspicion the placebut Lin McLean Nor yet dont yus believe his is
the kind that breaksif any kind does that You may sit till the gray
hairs and you may wall up your womanhood but if a man has got manhood
like him he will never sit till the gray hairs Grief over losin the
best will not stop him from searchin for a second best after a
while He wants a home and he has got a right to one says I to Miss
Jessamine You have not walled up Lin McLean I says to her Wait
Lin wait Yus neednt to tell me thats a lie I know a man thinks hes
walled up for a while

She could have told you it was a lie said the cowpuncher

She did not Let him get a home says she I want him to be happy
That flash in your eyes talks different says I Sure enough yus
wants him to be happy Sure enough But not happy along with Miss Second
Best

Lin she looked at me that piercin

And I goes on for I was wound away up And he will be happy too I
says Miss Second Best will have a talk with him about your picture and
little Neighbor which hell not send back to yus because the hurt in
his heart is there And he will keep em out of sight somewheres after
his talk with Miss Second Best Lin Lin I laughed at them words of
mine but I was that wound up I was strange to myself And she watchin
me that way And I says to her Miss Second Best will not be the crazy
thing to think I am any wife of his standing in her way He will tell
her about me He will tell how onced he thought he was solid married to
me till Lusk came back and she will drop me out of sight along with the
rest that went nameless They was not uncomprehensible to you was they
You have learned something by livin I guess And Linyour Lin not
mine nor never mine in heart for a day so deep as hes yourn right
nowhe has been gaygay as any Ive knowed Why look at that face of
his Could a boy with a face like that help bein gay But that dont
touch whats the true Lin deep down Nor will his deepdown love for
you hinder him like it will hinder you Dont you know men and us is
different when it comes to passion Were all one thing then but they
aint simple They keep along with lots of other things I cant make
yus know and I guess it takes a woman like I have been to learn their
nature But you did know he loved you and you sent him away and youll
be homeless in yer house when he has done the right thing by himself and
found another girl

Lin all the while I was talkin all I knowed to her without knowin
what Id be sayin next for it come that unexpected she was lookin
at me with them steady eyes And all she says when I quit was If I saw
him I would tell him to find a home

Didnt she tell yu shed made me promise to keep away from seeing
her asked the cowpuncher

Mrs Lusk laughed Oh you innocent said she

She said if I came she would leave Separ muttered McLean brooding

Again the large woman laughed out but more harshly

I have kept my promise Lin continued

Keep it some more Sit here rotting in your chair till she goes away
Maybe shes gone

Whats that said Lin But still she only laughed harshly I could
be there by tomorrow night he murmured Then his face softened She
would never do such a thing he said to himself

He had forgotten the woman at the table While she had told him matters
that concerned him he had listened eagerly Now she was of no more
interest than she had been before her story was begun She looked at his
eyes as he sat thinking and dwelling upon his sweetheart She looked at
him and a longing welled up into her face A certain youth and heavy
beauty relighted the features

You are the same same Lin everyways she said A woman is too many
for you still Lin she whispered

At her summons he looked up from his revery

Lin I would not have treated you so

The caress that filled her voice was plain His look met hers as he sat
quite still his arms on the table Then he took his turn at laughing

You he said At least Ive had plenty of education in you

Lin Lin dont talk that brutal to me today If yus knowed how near I
come shooting myself with Neighbor That would have been funny

I knowed yus wanted to tear that pistol out of my hand because it was
hern But yus never did such things to me fer theres a gentleman in
you somewheres Lin And yus didnt never hit me not even when you come
to know me well And when I seen you so unexpected again tonight and
you just the same old Lin scaring Lusk with shooting them chickens so
comic and splendid I could a just killed Lusk sittin in the wagon
Say Lin what made yus do that anyway

I cant hardly say said the cowpuncher Only noticing him so
turruble anxious to quit mewell a man acts without thinking

You always did Lin You was always a comical genius Lin them were
good times

Which times

You know You cant tell me you have forgot

I have not forgot much Whats the sense in this

Yus never loved me she exclaimed

Shucks

Lin Lin is it all over You know yus loved me on Bear Creek Say you
did Only say it was once that way And as he sat she came and put her
arms round his neck For a moment he did not move letting himself be
held and then she kissed him The plates crashed as he beat and struck
her down upon the table He was on his feet cursing himself As he went
out of the door she lay where she had fallen beneath his fist looking
after him and smiling

McLean walked down Box Elder Creek through the trees toward the stable
where Lusk had gone to put the horse in the wagon Once he leaned his
hand against a big cottonwood and stood still with halfclosed eyes
Then he continued on his way Lusk he called presently and in a few
steps more Lusk Then as he came slowly out of the trees to meet the
husband he began with quiet evenness Your wife wants to know But
he stopped No husband was there Wagon and horse were not there The
door was shut The bewildered cowpuncher looked up the stream where the
road went and he looked down Out of the sky where daylight and stars
were faintly shining together sounded the long cries of the night hawks
as they sped and swooped to their hunting in the dusk From among the
trees by the stream floated a cooler air and distant and close by
sounded the splashing water About the meadow where Lin stood his horses
fed quietly crunching He went to the door looked in and shut it
again He walked to his shed and stood contemplating his own wagon alone
there Then he lifted away a piece of trailing vine from the gate of
the corral while the turkeys moved their heads and watched him from the
roof A rope was hanging from the corral and seeing it he dropped the
vine He opened the corral gate and walked quickly back into the middle
of the field where the horses saw him and his rope and scattered But
he ran and herded them whirling the rope and so drove them into the
corral and flung his noose over two He dragged two saddlesmens
saddlesfrom the stable and next he was again at his cabin door with
the horses saddled She was sitting quite still by the table where she
had sat during the meal nor did she speak or move when she saw him look
in at the door

Lusk has gone said he I dont know what he expected you would do
or I would do But we will catch him before he gets to Drybone

She looked at him with her dumb stare Gone she said

Get up and ride said McLean You are going to Drybone

Drybone she echoed Her voice was toneless and dull

He made no more explanations to her but went quickly about the cabin
Soon he had set it in order the dishes on their shelves the table
clean the fire in the stove arranged and all these movements she
followed with a sort of blank mechanical patience He made a small
bundle for his own journey tied it behind his saddle brought her horse
beside a stump When at his sharp order she came out he locked his
cabin and hung the key by a window where travellers could find it and
be at home

She stood looking where her husband had slunk off Then she laughed
Its about his size she murmured

Her old lover helped her in silence to mount into the mans saddlethis
they had often done together in former yearsand so they took their way
down the silent road They had not many miles to go and after the first
two lay behind them when the horses were limbered and had been put to
a canter they made time quickly They had soon passed out of the trees
and pastures of Box Elder and came among the vast low stretches of the
greater valley Not even by day was the rivers course often discernible
through the ridges and cheating sameness of this wilderness and beneath
this halfdarkness of stars and a quarter moon the sage spread shapeless
to the looming mountains or to nothing

I will ask you one thing said Lin after ten miles

The woman made no sign of attention as she rode beside him

Did I understand that sheMiss Buckner I meanmentioned she might be
going away from Separ

How do I know what you understood

I thought you said

Dont you bother me Lin McLean Her laugh rang out loud and
forlornone brief burst that startled the horses and that must have
sounded far across the sagebrush You men are rich she said

They rode on side by side and saying nothing after that The Drybone
road was a broad trail a worn strip of bareness going onward over
the endless shelvings of the plain visible even in this light and
presently moving upon its grayness on a hill in front of them they
made out the wagon They hastened and overtook it

Put your carbine down said McLean to Lusk Its not robbers Its
your wife Im bringing you He spoke very quietly

The husband addressed no word to the cowpuncher Get in then he said
to his wife

Towns not far now said Lin Maybe you would prefer riding the
balance of the way

Id But the note of pity that she felt in McLeans question overcame
her and her utterance choked She nodded her head and the three
continued slowly climbing the hill together

From the narrows of the steep sandy weatherbeaten banks that the
road slanted upward through for a while they came out again upon the
immensity of the tableland Here abruptly like an ambush was the
whole unsuspected river close below to their right as if it had emerged
from the earth With a circling sweep from somewhere out in the gloom
it cut in close to the lofty mesa beneath tall cleangraded descents of
sand smooth as a railroad embankment As they paused on the level to
breathe their horses the wet gulp of its eddies rose to them through
the stillness Upstream they could make out the light of the Drybone
bridge but not the bridge itself and two lights on the farther bank
showed where stood the hogranch opposite Drybone They went on over
the tableland and reached the next herald of the town Drybones
chief historian the graveyard Beneath its slanting headboards and
windshifted sand lay many more people than lived in Drybone They
passed by the fence of this shelterless acre on the hill and shoutings
and high music began to reach them At the foot of the hill they saw the
sparse lights and shapes of the town where ended the gray strip of road
The many soundsfeet voices and musicgrew clearer unravelling from
their muffled confusion and the fiddling became a tune that could be
known

Theres a dance tonight said the wife to the husband Hurry

He drove as he had been driving Perhaps he had not heard her

Im telling you to hurry she repeated My new dress is in that
wagon Therell be folks to welcome me here thats older friends than
you

She put her horse to a gallop down the broad road toward the music and
the older friends The husband spoke to his horse cleared his throat
and spoke louder cleared his throat again and this time his sullen
voice carried and the animal started So Lusk went ahead of Lin McLean
following his wife with the new dress at as good a pace as he might If
he did not want her company perhaps to be alone with the cowpuncher
was still less to his mind

It aint only her hes stopped caring for mused Lin as he rode
slowly along He dont care for himself any more



PART III

Today Drybone has altogether returned to the dust Even in that day
its hour could have been heard beginning to sound but its inhabitants
were rather deaf Gamblers saloonkeepers murderers outlaws male
and female all were so busy with their cards their lovers and their
bottles as to make the place seem young and vigorous but it was second
childhood which had set in

Drybone had known a wholesome adventurous youth where manly lives and
deaths were plenty It had been an army post It had seen horse and
foot and heard the trumpet Brave wives had kept house for their
captains upon its bluffs Winter and summer they had made the best of
it When the War Department ordered the captains to catch Indians
the wives bade them Godspeed When the Interior Department ordered the
captains to let the Indians go again still they made the best of it
You must not waste Indians Indians were a source of revenue to so many
people in Washington and elsewhere But the process of catching Indians
armed with weapons sold them by friends of the Interior Department was
not entirely harmless Therefore there came to be graves in the Drybone
graveyard The pale weatherwashed headboards told all about it
Sacred to the memory of Private SoandSo killed on the Dry Cheyenne
May 6 1875 Or it would be Mrs SoandSo found scalped on Sage
Creek But even the financiers at Washington could not wholly preserve
the Indian in Drybones neighborhood As the cattle by ten thousands
came treading with the next step of civilization into this huge domain
the soldiers were taken away Some of them went West to fight more
Indians in Idaho Oregon or Arizona The battles of the others being
done they went East in better coffins to sleep where their mothers or
their comrades wanted them Though wind and rain wrought changes upon
the hill the readymade graves and boxes which these soldiers left
behind proved heirlooms as serviceable in their way as were the
tenements that the living had bequeathed to Drybone Into these
empty barracks came to dwell and do business every joy that made the
cowpunchers holiday and every hunted person who was baffling the
sheriff For the sheriff must stop outside the line of Drybone as
shall presently be made clear The captains quarters were a saloon now
professional cards were going in the adjutants office night and day
and the commissary building made a good dancehall and hotel Instead
of guardmounting you would see a horserace on the paradeground and
there was no provostsergeant to gather up the broken bottles and old
boots Heaps of these choked the rusty fountain In the tufts of yellow
ragged grass that dotted the place plentifully were lodged many aces
and queens and tenspots which the Drybone wind had blown wide from the
doors out of which they had been thrown when a new pack was called for
inside Among the grass tufts would lie visitors who had applied for
beds too late at the dancehall frankly sleeping their whiskey off in
the morning air

Above on the hill the graveyard quietly chronicled this new epoch of
Drybone Soandso was seldom killed very far out of town and of course
scalping had disappeared Sacred to the memory of Fourace Johnston
accidently shot Sep 4 1885 Perhaps one is still there unaltered
Sacred to the memory of Mrs Ryans babe Aged two months This unique
corpse had succeeded in dying with its boots off

But a succession of graves was not always needed to read the changing
tale of the place and how people died there one grave would often be
enough The soldiers of course had kept treeless Drybone supplied with
wood But in these latter days wood was very scarce None grew nearer
than twenty or thirty milesnone that is to make boards of a
sufficient width for epitaphs And twenty miles was naturally far to go
to hew a board for a man of whom you knew perhaps nothing but what he
said his name was and to whom you owed nothing perhaps but a trifling
poker debt Hence it came to pass that headboards grew into a sort of
directory They were light to lift from one place to another A single
coat of white paint would wipe out the first tenants name sufficiently
to paint over it the next comers By this thrifty habit the original
boards belonging to the soldiers could go round keeping pace with the
new civilian population and though at first sight you might be puzzled
by the layers of names still visible beneath the white paint you could
be sure that the clearest and blackest was the one to which the present
tenant had answered

So there on the hill lay the graveyard steadily writing Drybones
history and making that history lay the town at the bottomone thin
line of houses framing three sides of the old parade ground In these
slowly rotting shells people rioted believing the golden age was here
the age when everybody should have money and nobody should be arrested
For Drybone soil you see was still government soil not yet handed
over to Wyoming and only government could arrest there and only for
government crimes But government had gone and seldom worried Drybone
The spot was a postagestamp of sanctuary pasted in the middle of
Wyomings big map a paradise for the Fourace Johnstons Only you must
not steal a horse That was really wicked and brought you instantly to
the notice of Drybones one officialthe coroner For they did keep a
coronerJudge Slaghammer He was perfectly illegal and lived next door
in Albany County But that county paid fees and mileage to keep tally of
Drybones casualties His wife owned the dancehall and between their
industries they made out a living And all the citizens made out a
living The happy cowpunchers on ranches far and near still earned and
instantly spent the high wages still paid them With their bodies
full of youth and their pockets full of gold they rode into town by
twenties by fifties and out again next morning penniless always and
happy And then the Fourace Johnstons would sit cardplaying with each
other till the innocents should come to town again

Tonight the innocents had certainly come to town and Drybone was
furnishing to them all its joys Their many horses stood tied at every
post and cornerpatient experienced cowponies well knowing it was
an allnight affair The talk and laughter of the riders was in the
saloons they leaned joking over the bars they sat behind their cards
at the tables they strolled to the posttraders to buy presents for
their easy sweethearts their boots were keeping audible time with the
fiddle at Mrs Slaghammers From the multitude and vigor of the sounds
there the dance was being done regularly Regularly meant that upon
the conclusion of each set the gentleman led his lady to the bar and
invited her to choose and it was also regular that the lady should
choose Beer and whiskey were the alternatives

Lin McLeans horse took him across the square without guiding from the
cowpuncher who sat absently with his hands folded upon the horn of his
saddle This horse too was patient and experienced and could not know
what remote thoughts filled his masters mind He looked around to see
why his master did not get off lightly as he had done during so
many gallant years and hasten in to the conviviality But the lonely
cowpuncher sat mechanically identifying the horses of acquaintances

Toothpick Kid is here said he and Limber Jim and the Doughie
Youd think hed stay away after the trouble heI expect that pinto is
Jerky Bills

Go home said a hearty voice

McLean eagerly turned For the moment his face lighted from its
sombreness Id forgot youd be here said he And he sprang to the
ground Its fine to see you

Go home repeated the Governor of Wyoming shaking his ancient
friends hand You in Drybone tonight and claim youre reformed

Yu seem to be on hand yourself said the cowpuncher bracing to be
jocular if he could

Me Ive gone fishing Dont you read the papers If we poor governors
cant lock up the State House and take a whirl now and then

Doc interrupted Lin its plumb fine to see yu Again he shook
hands

Why yes weve met here before you and I His Excellency the Hon
Amory W Barker MD stood laughing familiar and genial his sound
white teeth shining But behind his round spectacles he scrutinized
McLean For in this second handshaking was a fervor that seemed a
grasp a reaching out for comfort Barker had passed through Separ
Though an older acquaintance than Billy he had asked Jessamine fewer
and different questions But he knew what he knew Well Drybones the
same old Drybone said he Sweetscented hole of iniquity Lets see
how you walk nowadays

Lin took a few steps

Pooh I said youd never get over it And his Excellency beamed with
professional pride In his doctor days Barker had set the boy McLeans
leg and before it was properly knit the boy had escaped from the
hospital to revel loose in Drybone on such another night as this Soon
he had been carried back with the fracture split open again

It shows does it said Lin Well it dont usually Not except when
Imwhen Im

Down suggested his Excellency

Yes Doc Down the cowpuncher confessed

Barker looked into his friends clear hazel eyes

Beneath their dauntless sparkle was something that touched the
Governors good heart Ive got some whiskey along on the tripEastern
whiskey said he Come over to my room awhile

I used to sleep all night onced said McLean as they went Then I
come to know different But Id never have believed just mere thoughts
could make yumake yu feel like the steam was only half on I eat
yu know he stated suddenly And I expect one or two in camp lately
have not found my muscle lacking Feel me Doc

Barker dutifully obeyed and praised the excellent sinews

Across from the dancehall the whining of the fiddle came high and gay
feet blurred the talk of voices and voices rose above the trampling of
feet Here and there some lurking form stumbled through the dark among
the rubbish and clearest sound of all the light crack of billiard
balls reached dry and far into the night Barker contemplated the stars
and calm splendid dimness of the plain Though every prospect pleases
and only man is vile he quoted But dont tell the Republican party
I said so

Its awful true though Doc Im vile myself Yu dont know Why I
didnt know

And then they sat down to confidences and whiskey for so long as the
world goes round a man must talk to a man sometimes and both must drink
over it The cowpuncher unburdened himself to the Governor and the
Governor filled up his friends glass with the Eastern whiskey and
nodded his spectacles and listened and advised and said he should
have done the same and like the good Governor that he was never
remembered he was Governor at all with political friends here who
had begged a word or two He became just Dr Barker again the young
hospital surgeon the hospital that now stood a ruin and Lin was again
his patientLin the sunburnt freelance of nineteen reckless
engaging disobedient his leg broken and his heart light with no
Jessamine or conscience to rob his salt of its savor While he now told
his troubles the quadrilles fiddled away careless as ever and the
crack of the billiard balls sounded as of old

Nobody has told you about this I expect said the lover He brought
forth the little pistol Neighbor He did not hand it across to
Barker but walked over to Barkers chair and stood holding it for the
doctor to see When Barker reached for it to see better since it was
half hidden in the cowpunchers big hand Lin yielded it to him but
still stood and soon drew it back I take it around he said and
when one of those stories comes along like theres plenty of that she
wants to get rid of me I just kind o take a look at Neighbor when
Im off where its handy and it busts the story right out of my mind I
have to tell you what a fool I am

The whiskeys your side said Barker Go on

But Doc my courage has quit me They see what Im thinking about just
like I was a tenderfoot trying his first bluff I cant stick it out no
more and Im going to see her come what will

Ive got to Im going to ride right up to her window and shoot off
Neighbor and if she dont come out Ill know

A knocking came at the Governors room and Judge Slaghammer entered
Not been to our dance Governor said he

The Governor thought that perhaps he was tired that perhaps this
evening he must forego the pleasure

It may be wiser In your position it may be advisable said the
coroner Theyre getting on rollers over there We do not like trouble
in Drybone but trouble comes to usas everywhere

Shooting suggested his Excellency recalling his hospital practice

Well Governor you know how it is Our boys are as bighearted as any
in this bighearted Western country You know Governor Those generous
warmblooded spirits are ever ready for anything

Especially after Mrs Slaghammers whiskey remarked the Governor

The coroner shot a shrewd eye at Wyomings chief executive It was not
politically harmonious to be reminded that but for his wifes liquor a
number of fine young men with nothing save youth untrained and health
the matter with them would today be riding their horses instead
of sleeping on the hill But the coroner wanted support in the next
campaign Boys will be boys said he They aint pulled any guns
tonight But I come away though Some of ems making up pretty free
to Mrs Lusk It aint suitable for me to see too much Lusk says hes
after you he mentioned incidentally to Lin Hes fillin up and says
hes after you McLean nodded placidly and with scant politeness
He wished this visitor would go But Judge Slaghammer had noticed the
whiskey He filled himself a glass Governor it has my compliments
said he Ambrosier Honeydoo

Mrs Slaghammer seems to have a large gathering said Barker

Good boys good boys The judge blew importantly and waved his arm
Bullwhackers cowpunchers muleskinners tinhorns All spending
generous Governor once more Ambrosier Honeydoo He settled himself
deep in a chair and closed his eyes

McLean rose abruptly Goodnight said he Im going to Separ

Separ exclaimed Slaghammer rousing slightly Oh stay with us stay
with us He closed his eyes again but sustained his smile of office

You know how well I wish you said Barker to Lin Ill just see you
start

Forthwith the friends left the coroner quiet beside his glass and
walked toward the horses through Drybones gaping quadrangle The dead
ruins loomed among the lights of the cardhalls and always the keen
jockey cadences of the fiddle sang across the night But a calling and
confusion were set up and the tune broke off

Just like old times said his Excellency Wheres the dumppile It
was where it should be close by and the two stepped behind it to
be screened from wandering bullets A man dont forget his habits
declared the Governor Makes me feel young again

Makes me feel old said McLean Hark

Sounds like my name said Barker They listened Oh yes Of course
Thats it Theyre shouting for the doctor But well just spare them a
minute or so to finish their excitement

I didnt hear any shooting said McLean Its something though

As they waited no shots came but still the fiddle was silent and
the murmur of many voices grew in the dancehall while single voices
wandered outside calling the doctors name

Im the Governor on a fishingtrip said he But its to be done I
suppose

They left their dumphill and proceeded over to the dance The musician
sat high and solitary upon two starchboxes fiddle on knee staring and
waiting Half the floor was bare on the other half the revellers were
densely clotted At the crowds outer rim the young horsemen flushed
and swaying retained their gaudy dance partners strongly by the waist
to be ready when the music should resume What is it they asked Who
is it And they looked in across heads and shoulders inattentive to
the caresses which the partners gave them

Mrs Lusk was who it was and she had taken poison here in their midst
after many dances and drinks

Heres Doc cried an older one

Heres Doc chorused the young blood that had come into this country
since his day And the throng caught up the words Heres Doc heres
Doc

In a moment McLean and Barker were sundered from each other in this
flood Barker sucked in toward the centre but often eddied back by
those who meant to help him heard the mixed explanations pass his ear
unfinishedversions contradictions a score of facts It had been
wolfpoison It had been Rough on Rats It had been something in a
bottle There was little steering in this clamorous sea but Barker
reached his patient where she sat in her new dress hailing him with
wild inebriate gayety

I must get her to her room friends said he

He must get her to her room went the word Leave Doc get her to her
room And they tangled in their eagerness around him and his patient

Give us Buffalo Girls shouted Mrs Lusk Buffalo Girls you
fiddler

Well come back said Barker to her

Buffalo Girls I tell yus Ho Theres no sense looking at that
bottle Doc Take yer dance while theres time She was holding the
chair

Help him said the crowd Help Doc

They took her from her chair and she fought a big pink mass of
ribbons fluttering and wrenching itself among them

She has six ounces of laudanum in her Barker told them at the top of
his voice It wont wait all night

Im a whirlwind said Mrs Lusk Thats my game And you done your
share she cried to the fiddler Heres my regards old man Buffalo
Girls once more

She flung out her hand and from it fell notes and coins rolling
and ringing around the starch boxes Some dragged her on while some
fiercely forbade the musician to touch the money because it was hers
and she would want it when she came to Thus they gathered it up for
her But now she had sunk down asking in a new voice where was Lin
McLean And when one grinning intimate reminded her that Lusk had gone
to shoot him she laughed out richly and the crowd joined her mirth
But even in the midst of the joke she asked again in the same voice
where was Lin McLean He came beside her among more jokes He had kept
himself near and now at sight of him she reached out and held him
Tell them to leave me go to sleep Lin said she

Barker saw a chance Persuade her to come along said he to McLean
Minutes are counting now

Oh Ill come she said with a laugh overhearing him and holding
still to Lin

The rest of the old friends nudged each other Back seats for us they
said But weve had our turn in front ones Then thinking they would
be useful in encouraging her to walk they clustered again rendering
Barker and McLean once more wellnigh helpless Clumsily the escort made
its slow way across the quadrangle cautioning itself about stones and
holes Thus presently she was brought into the room The escort set
her down crowding the little place as thick as it would hold the rest
gathered thick at the door and all of them had no thought of departing
The notion to stay was plain on their faces

Barker surveyed them Give the doctor a show now boys said he
Youve done it all so far Dont crowd my elbows Ill want you he
whispered to McLean

At the argument of fairplay obedience swept over them like a veering
of wind Dont crowd his elbows they began to say at once and told
each other to come away Well sure give the Doc room You dont want
to be shovin your auger in Chalkeye You want to get yourself pretty
near absent The room thinned of them forthwith Fix her up good
Doc they said over their shoulders They shuffled across the
threshold and porch with roundabout schemes to tread quietly When one
or other stumbled on the steps and fell he was jerked to his feet
You want to tame yourself was the word Then suddenly Chalkeye
and Toothpick Kid came precipitately back Her cash they said And
leaving the notes and coins they hastened to catch their comrades on
the way back to the dance

I want you repeated Barker to McLean

Him cried Mrs Lusk flashing alert again Jessamine wants him about
now I guess Dont keep him from his girl And she laughed her hard
rich laugh looking from one to the other Not the two of yus cant
save me she stated defiantly But even in these last words a sort of
thickness sounded

Walk her up and down said Barker Keep her moving Ill look what
I can find Keep her moving brisk At once he was out of the door and
before his running steps had died away the fiddle had taken up its tune
across the quadrangle

Buffalo Girls exclaimed the woman Old times Old times

Come said McLean Walk And he took her

Her head was full of the music Forgetting all but that she went with
him easily and the two made their first turns around the room Whenever
he brought her near the entrance she leaned away from him toward the
open door where the old fiddle tune was coming in from the dark
But presently she noticed that she was being led and her face turned
sullen

Walk said McLean

Do you think so said she laughing But she found that she must go
with him Thus they took a few more turns

Youre hurting me she said next Then a look of drowsy cunning filled
her eyes and she fixed them upon McLeans dogged face Hes gone
Lin she murmured raising her hand where Barker had disappeared

She knew McLean had heard her and she held back on the quickened pace
that he had set

Leave me down You hurt she pleaded hanging on him

The cowpuncher put forth more strength

Just the floor she pleaded again Just one minute on the floor
Hell think you could not keep me lifted

Still McLean made no answer but steadily led her round and round as he
had undertaken

Hes playing out she exclaimed Youll be played out soon She
laughed herself halfawake The man drew a breath and she laughed more
to feel his hand and arm strain to surmount her increasing resistance
Jessamine she whispered to him Jessamine Docll never suspicion
you Lin

Talk sense said he

Its sense Im talking Leave me go to sleep Ah ah Im going Ill
go you cant

Walk walk he repeated He looked at the door An ache was numbing
his arms

Oh yes walk What can you and all your muscleAh walk me to glory
then craziness Im going Ill go Im quitting this outfit for keeps
Lin youre awful handsome tonight Ill betIll bet she has never
seen you look so Let melet me watch yus Anyway she knows I came
first

He grasped her savagely First You and twenty of yu dontGod what
do I talk to her for

BecausebecauseIm going Ill go He slung me offbut he had to
slingyou cantstop

Her head was rolling while the lips smiled Her words came through
deeper and deeper veils fearless defiant a challenge inarticulate a
continuous mutter Again he looked at the door as he struggled to move
with her dragging weight The drops rolled on his forehead and neck his
shirt was wet his hands slipped upon her ribbons Suddenly the drugged
body folded and sank with him pulling him to his knees While he took
breath so the mutter went on and through the door came the jigging
fiddle A fire of desperation lighted in his eyes Buffalo Girls he
shouted hoarsely in her ear and got once more on his feet with her
as though they were two partners in a quadrille Still shouting her to
wake he struck a tottering sort of step and so with the bending load
in his grip strove feebly to dance the laudanum away

Feet stumbled across the porch and Lusk was in the room So Ive got
you he said He had no weapon but made a dive under the bed and came
up with a carbine The two men locked wrenching impotently and fell
together The carbines loud shot rang in the room but did no harm and
McLean lay sick and panting upon Lusk as Barker rushed in

Thank God said he and flung Lusks pistol down The man deranged
and encouraged by drink had come across the doctor delayed him
threatened him with his pistol and when he had torn it away had left
him suddenly and vanished But Barker had feared and come after him
here He glanced at the woman slumbering motionless beside the two men
The husbands brief courage had gone and he lay beneath McLean who
himself could not rise Barker pulled them apart

Lin boy youre not hurt he asked affectionately and lifted the
cowpuncher

McLean sat passive with dazed eyes letting himself be supported

Youre not hurt repeated Barker

No answered the cowpuncher slowly I guess not He looked about
the room and at the door I got interrupted he said

Youll be all right soon said Barker

Nobody cares for me cried Lusk suddenly and took to querulous
weeping

Get up ordered Barker sternly

Dont accuse me Governor screamed Lusk Im innocent And he rose

Barker looked at the woman and then at the husband Ill not say there
was much chance for her he said But any she had is gone through you
Shell die

Nobody cares for me repeated the man He has learned my boy to scorn
me He ran out aimlessly and away into the night leaving peace in the
room

Stay sitting said Barker to McLean and went to Mrs Lusk

But the cowpuncher seeing him begin to lift her toward the bed without
help tried to rise His strength was not sufficiently come back and he
sank as he had been I guess I dont amount to much said he I feel
like I was nothing

Well Im something said Barker coming back to his friend out of
breath And I know what she weighs He stared admiringly through his
spectacles at the seated man

The cowpunchers eyes slowly travelled over his body and then sought
Barkers face Doc said he aint I young to have my nerve quit me
this way

His Excellency broke into his broad smile

I know Ive racketed some but aint it ruther early pursued McLean
wistfully

You sixfoot infant said Barker Look at your hand

Lin stared at itthe fingers quivering and bloody and the skin grooved
raw between them That was the buckle of her belt which in the struggle
had worked round and been held by him unknowingly Both his wrists and
his shirt were ribbed with the pink of her sashes He looked over at the
bed where lay the woman heavily breathing It was a something a sound
not like the breath of life and Barker saw the cowpuncher shudder

She is strong he said Her system will fight to the end Two hours
yet maybe Queer world he moralized People half killing themselves
to keep one in it who wanted to goand one that nobody wanted to stay

McLean did not hear He was musing his eyes fixed absently in front of
him I would not want he said with hesitating utteranceId
not wish for even my enemy to have a thing like what Ive had to do
tonight

Barker touched him on the arm If there had been another man I could
trust

Trust broke in the cowpuncher Why Doc it is the best turn yu
ever done me I know I am a man nowif my nerve aint gone

Ive known you were a man since I knew you said the hearty Governor
And he helped the still unsteady sixfoot to a chair As for your
nerve Ill bring you some whiskey now And afterhe glanced at
the bedand tomorrow youll go try if Miss Jessamine wont put the
nerve

Yes Doc Ill go there I know But dont yudont lets while
shesIm going to be glad about this Doc after awhile but

At the sight of a newcomer in the door he stopped in what his soul was
stammering to say What do you want Judge he inquired coldly

I understand began Slaghammer to BarkerI am informed

Speak quieter Judge said the cowpuncher

I understand repeated Slaghammer more official than ever that
there was a case for the coroner

Youll be notified put in McLean again Meanwhile youll talk quiet
in this room

Slaghammer turned and saw the breathing mass on the bed

You are a little early Judge said Barker but

But your ten dollars are safe said McLean

The coroner shot one of his shrewd glances at the cowpuncher and sat
down with an amiable countenance His fee was indeed ten dollars and
he was desirous of a second term

Under the apprehension that it had already occurredthe
misapprehensionI took steps to impanel a jury said he addressing
both Barker and McLean They areahwaiting outside Responsible men
Governor and have sat before Drybone has few responsible men tonight
but I procured these at a little game where they wereahlosing You
may go back gentlemen said he going to the door I will summon
you in proper time He looked in the room again Is the husband not
intending

Thats enough Judge said McLean Theres too many here without
adding him

Judge spoke a voice at the door aint she ready yet

She is still passing away observed Slaghammer piously

Because I was thinking said the manI was justYou see us jury is
dry and dead broke Doggonedest cards Ive held this year andJudge
would there be anything out of the way in me touching my fee in advance
if its a sure thing

I see none my friend said Slaghammer benevolently since it must
be He shook his head and nodded it by turns Then with fullblown
importance he sat again and wrote a paper his coroners certificate
Next door in Albany County these vouchers brought their face value of
five dollars to the holder but on Drybones neutral soil the saloons
would always pay four for them and it was rare that any juryman could
withstand the temptation of four immediate dollars This one gratefully
received his paper and cherishing it like a bird in the hand he with
his colleagues bore it where they might wait for duty and slake their
thirst

In the silent room sat Lin McLean his body coming to life more readily
than his shaken spirit Barker seeing that the cowpuncher meant
to watch until the end brought the whiskey to him Slaghammer drew
documents from his pocket to fill the time but was soon in slumber over
them In all precincts of the quadrangle Drybone was keeping it up late
The fiddle the occasional shouts and the crack of the billiardballs
travelled clear and far through the vast darkness outside Presently
steps unsteadily drew near and round the corner of the door a voice
plaintive and diffident said Judge aint she most pretty near
ready

Wake up Judge said Barker Your jury has gone dry again

The man appeared round the doora handsome dishevelled fellowwith
hat in hand balancing himself with respectful anxiety Thus was a
second voucher made out and the messenger strayed back happy to his
friends Barker and McLean sat wakeful and Slaghammer fell at once
to napping From time to time he was roused by new messengers each
arriving more unsteady than the last until every juryman had got his
fee and no more messengers came The coroner slept undisturbed in
his chair McLean and Barker sat On the bed the mass with its pink
ribbons breathed and breathed while moths flew round the lamp tapping
and falling with light sounds So did the heart of the darkness wear
itself away and through the stonecold air the dawn began to filter and
expand

Barker rose bent over the bed and then stood Seeing him McLean stood
also

Judge said Barker quietly you may call them now And with careful
steps the judge got himself out of the room to summon his jury

For a short while the cowpuncher stood looking down upon the woman She
lay lumped in her gaudiness the ribbons darkly stained by the laudanum
but into the stolid bold features death had called up the faintcolored
ghost of youth and McLean remembered all his Bear Creek days Hind
sight is a turruble clear way o seein things said he I think Ill
take a walk

Go said Barker The jury only need me and Ill join you

But the jury needed no witness Their long waiting and the advance pay
had been too much for these responsible men Like brothers they had
shared each others vouchers until responsibility had melted from their
brains and the whiskey was finished Then no longer entertained and
growing weary of Drybone they had remembered nothing but their distant
beds Each had mounted his pony holding trustingly to the saddle and
thus unguided the experienced ponies had taken them right Across the
wide sagebrush and up and down the river they were now asleep or riding
dispersed irrevocably But the coroner was here He duly received
Barkers testimony brought his verdict in and signed it and even
while he was issuing to himself his own proper voucher for ten dollars
came Chalkeye and Toothpick Kid on their ponies galloping eager in
their hopes and good wishes for Mrs Lusk Life ran strong in them both
The night had gone well with them Here was the new day going to be
fine It must be well with everybody

You dont say they exclaimed taken aback Too bad

They sat still in their saddles and upon their reckless kindly faces
thought paused for a moment Her gone they murmured Hard to get
used to the idea Whats anybody doing about the coffin

Mr Lusk answered Slaghammer doubtless

Lusk Hell not know anything this forenoon Hes out there in the
grass She didnt think nothing of him Tell Billnot Dollar Bill
Jerky Bill yu know hes over the bridgeto fix up a hearse and
well be back The two drove their spurs in with vigorous heels and
instantly were gone rushing up the road to the graveyard

The fiddle had lately ceased and no dancers stayed any longer in the
hall Eastward the rose and gold began to flow down upon the plain over
the tops of the distant hills Of the revellers many had never gone to
bed and many now were already risen from their excesses to revive in
the cool glory of the morning Some were drinking to stay their hunger
until breakfast some splashed and sported in the river calling and
joking and across the river some were holding horseraces upon the
level beyond the hogranch Drybone air rang with them Their lusty
wandering shouts broke out in gusts of hilarity Their pistols aimed
at cans or prairie dogs or anything cracked as they galloped at large
Their speeding clearcut forms would shine upon the bluffs and
descending merge in the dust their horses had raised Yet all this was
nothing in the vastness of the growing day

Beyond their voices the rim of the sun moved above the violet hills and
Drybone amid the quiet long new fields of radiance stood august and
strange

Down along the tall bare slant from the graveyard the two horsemen were
riding back They could be seen across the river and the horseracers
grew curious As more and more watched the crowd began to speak It was
a calf the two were bringing It was too small for a calf It was dead
It was a coyote they had roped See it swing See it fall on the road

Its a coffin boys said one shrewd at guessing

At that the event of last night drifted across their memories and they
wheeled and spurred their ponies Their crowding hoofs on the bridge
brought the swimmers from the waters below and dressing they climbed
quickly to the plain and followed the gathering By the door already
were Jerky Bill and Limber Jim and the Doughie and always more dashing
up with their ponies halting with a sharp scatter of gravel to hear and
comment Barker was gone but the important coroner told his news And
it amazed each comer and set him speaking and remembering past things
with the others Dead each one began Her does he say

Why pshaw

Why Frenchy said Doc had her cured

Jack Saunders claimed she had rode to Box Elder with Lin McLean Dead
Why pshaw

Seems Doc couldnt swim her out

Couldnt swim her out

Thats it Doc couldnt swim her out

Welltheres one less of us

Sure She was one of the boys

She grubstaked me when I went broke in 84

She gave me fifty dollars onced at Lander to buy a saddle

I run agin her when she was a biscuitshooter

Sidney Nebraska I run again her there too

I knowed her at Laramie

Wheres Lin He knowed her all the way from Bear Creek to Cheyenne

They laughed loudly at this

Thats a lonesome coffin said the Doughie That the best you could
do

Youd say so said Toothpick Kid

Choices are getting scarce up there said Chalkeye We looked the lot
over

They were arriving from their search among the old dugup graves on
the hill Now they descended from their ponies with the box roped and
rattling between them Wheres your hearse Jerky asked Chalkeye

Have her round in a minute said the cowboy and galloped away with
three or four others

Turruble lonesome coffin all the same repeated the Doughie And they
surveyed the box that had once held some soldier

She did like fixins said Limber Jim

Fixins said Toothpick Kid Thats easy

While some six of them with Chalkeye bore the light halfrotted
coffin into the room many followed Toothpick Kid to the posttraders
store Breaking in here they found men sleeping on the counters These
had been able to find no other beds in Drybone and lay as they had
stretched themselves on entering They sprawled in heavy slumber some
with not even their hats taken off and some with their boots against
the rough hair of the next one They were quickly pushed together few
waking and so there was space for spreading cloth and chintz Stuffs
were unrolled and flung aside till many folds and colors draped the
motionless sleepers and at length a choice was made Unmeasured yards
of this drab chintz were ripped off money treble its worth was thumped
upon the counter and they returned bearing it like a streamer to the
coffin While the noise of their hammers filled the room the hearse
came tottering to the door pulled and pushed by twenty men It was an
ambulance left behind by the soldiers and of the oldfashioned shape
concave in body its top blown away in winds of long ago and as they
revolved its wheels dished in and out like hoops about to fall While
some made a harness from ropes and throwing the saddles off two ponies
backed them to the vehicle the body was put in the coffin now covered
by the chintz But the laudanum upon the front of her dress revolted
those who remembered their holidays with her and turning the woman upon
her face they looked their last upon her flashing colored ribbons and
nailed the lid down So they carried her out but the concave body of
the hearse was too short for the coffin the end reached out and it
might have fallen But Limber Jim taking the reins sat upon the other
end waiting and smoking For all Drybone was making ready to follow in
some way They had sought the husband the chief mourner He however
still lay in the grass of the quadrangle and despising him as she had
done they left him to wake when he should choose Those men who could
sit in their saddles rode escort the old friends nearest and four held
the heads of the frightened cowponies who were to draw the hearse They
had never known harness before and they plunged with the men who held
them Behind the hearse the women followed in a large ranchwagon this
moment arrived in town Two mares drew this and their foals gambolled
around them The great flattopped dray for hauling poles came last
with its four government mules The cowboys had caught sight of it and
captured it Rushing to the posttraders they carried the sleeping
men from the counter and laid them on the dray Then searching Drybone
outside and in for any more incapable of following they brought them
and the dray was piled

Limber Jim called for another drink and with his cigar between his
teeth cracked his long bullwhacker whip The ponies terrified sprang
away scattering the men that held them and the swaying hearse leaped
past the husband over the stones and the many playingcards in the
grass Masterfully steered it came safe to an open level while the
throng cheered the unmoved driver on his coffin his cigar between his
teeth

Stay with it Jim they shouted Youre a king

A steep ditch lay across the flat where he was veering abrupt and
nearly hidden but his eye caught the danger in time and swinging from
it leftward so that two wheels of the leaning coach were in the air
he faced the open again safe as the rescue swooped down upon him The
horsemen came at the ditch a body of daring a sultry blast of youth
Wheeling at the brink they turned whirling their long ropes The
skilful nooses flew and the ponies caught by the neck and foot were
dragged back to the quadrangle and held in line So the pageant started
the wild ponies quivering but subdued by the tightened ropes and the
coffin steady in the ambulance beneath the driver The escort in their
fringed leather and broad hats moved slowly beside and behind it many
of them swaying their faces full of health and the sun and the strong
drink The women followed whispering a little and behind them the
slow dray jolted with its heaps of men waking from the depths of their
whiskey and asking what this was So they went up the hill When the
riders reached the tilted gate of the graveyard they sprang off and
scattered among the hillocks stumbling and eager They nodded to Barker
and McLean quietly waiting there and began choosing among the open
weatherdrifted graves from which the soldiers had been taken Their
figures went up and down the uneven ridges calling and comparing

Here said the Doughie heres a good hole

Heres a deep one said another

Weve struck a well here said some more Put her in here

The sandhills became clamorous with voices until they arrived at a
choice when some one with a spade quickly squared the rainwashed
opening With lariats looping the coffin round they brought it and were
about to lower it when Chalkeye too near the edge fell in and one
end of the box rested upon him He could not rise by himself and they
pulled the ropes helplessly above

McLean spoke to Barker Id like to stop this said he but a man
might as well

Might as well stop a cloudburst said Barker

Yes Doc But it feelsit feels like I was looking at ten dozen Lin
McLeans And seeing them still helpless with Chalkeye he joined them
and lifted the cowboy out

I think said Slaghammer stepping forward this should proceed no
further without someperhaps some friend would recite Now I lay me

They dont use that on funerals said the Doughie

Will some gentleman give the Lords Prayer inquired the coroner

Foreheads were knotted triad mutterings ran among them but some one
remembered a prayer book in one of the rooms in Drybone and the notion
was hailed Four mounted and raced to bring it They went down the
hill in a flowing knot shirts ballooning and elbows flapping and so
returned But the book was beyond them Take it you you take it
each one said False beginnings were made big thumbs pushed the pages
back and forth until impatience conquered them They left the book
and lowered the coffin helped again by McLean The weight sank slowly
decently steadily down between the banks The sound that it struck the
bottom with was a slight sound the grating of the load upon the solid
sand and a little sand strewed from the edge and fell on the box at the
same moment The rattle came up from below compact and brief a single
jar quietly smiting through the crowd smiting it to silence One
removed his hat and then another and then all They stood eying each
his neighbor and shifting their eyes looked away at the great valley
Then they filled in the grave brought a headboard from a grave near
by and wrote the name and date upon it by scratching with a stone

She was sure one of us said Chalkeye Lets give her the Lament

And they followed his lead


 Once in the saddle I used to go dashing
 Once in the saddle I used to go gay
 First took to drinking and then to cardplaying
 Got shot in the body and now here I lay

 Beat the drum slowly Play the fife lowly
 Sound the dead march as you bear me along
 Take me to Boothill and throw the sod over me
 Im but a poor cowboy I know I done wrong


When the song was ended they left the graveyard quietly and went down
the hill The morning was growing warm Their work waited them across
many sunny miles of range and plain Soon their voices and themselves
had emptied away into the splendid vastness and silence and they were
goneready with all their might to live or to die to be animals or
heroes as the hours might bring them opportunity In Drybones deserted
quadrangle the sun shone down upon Lusk still sleeping and the wind
shook the aces and kings in the grass



PART IV

Over at Separ Jessamine Buckner had no more stockings of Billys to
mend and much time for thinking and a change of mind The day after
that strange visit when she had been told that she had hurt a good
mans heart without reason she took up her work and while her hands
despatched it her thoughts already accused her Could she have seen that
visitor now she would have thanked her She looked at the photograph on
her table Why did he go away so quickly she sighed But when young
Billy returned to his questions she was buoyant again and more than a
match for him He reached the forbidden twelfth time of asking why Lin
McLean did not come back and marry her Nor did she punish him as she
had threatened She looked at him confidentially and he drew near full
of hope

Billy Ill tell you just why it is said she Lin thinks Im not a
real girl

Aah drawled Billy backing from her with suspicion

Indeed thats what it is Billy If he knew I was a real girl

Aah went the boy entirely angry Anybody can tell youre a girl
And he marched out mystified and nursing a sense of wrong Nor did his
dignity allow him to reopen the subject

Today two miles out in the sagebrush by himself he was shooting
jackrabbits but began suddenly to run in toward Separ A horseman had
passed him and he had loudly called but the rider rode on intent upon
the little distant station Man and horse were soon far ahead of the
boy and the man came into town galloping

No need to fire the little pistol by her window as he had once thought
to do She was outside before he could leap to the ground And as he
held her she could only laugh and cry and say Forgive me Oh why
have you been so long She took him back to the room where his picture
was and made him sit and sat herself close What is it she asked
him For through the love she read something else in his serious face
So then he told her how nothing was wrong and as she listened to all
that he had to tell she too grew serious and held very close to him
Dear dear neighbor she said

As they sat so happy with deepening happiness but not gay yet young
Billy burst open the door There he cried I knowed Lin knowed you
were a girl

Thus did Billy also have his wish For had he not told Jessamine that he
liked her and urged her to come and live with him and Lin That cabin
on Box Elder became a home in truth with a woman inside taking the
only care of Mr McLean that he had known since his childhood though
singularly enough he has an impression that it is he who takes care of
Jessamine




IN THE AFTERDAYS

 The black pines stand high up the hills
 The white snow sifts their columns deep
 While through the canyons riven cleft
 From there beyond the rose clouds sweep

 Serene above their paling shapes
 One star hath wakened in the sky
 And here in the gray world below
 Over the sage the wind blows by

 Rides through the cottonwoods ghostranks
 And hums aloft a sturdy tune
 Among the rivers tawny bluffs
 Untenanted as is the moon

 Far neath the huge invading dusk
 Comes Silence awful through the plain
 But yonder horsemans heart is gay
 And he goes singing might and main
