THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER

IN SEVEN PARTS

By Samuel Taylor Coleridge



PART THE FIRST

 It is an ancient Mariner
 And he stoppeth one of three
 By thy long grey beard and glittering eye
 Now wherefore stoppst thou me

 The Bridegrooms doors are opened wide
 And I am next of kin
 The guests are met the feast is set
 Mayst hear the merry din

 He holds him with his skinny hand
 There was a ship quoth he
 Hold off unhand me greybeard loon
 Eftsoons his hand dropt he

 He holds him with his glittering eye
 The WeddingGuest stood still
 And listens like a three years child
 The Mariner hath his will

 The WeddingGuest sat on a stone
 He cannot chuse but hear
 And thus spake on that ancient man
 The brighteyed Mariner

 The ship was cheered the harbour cleared
 Merrily did we drop
 Below the kirk below the hill
 Below the lighthouse top

 The Sun came up upon the left
 Out of the sea came he
 And he shone bright and on the right
 Went down into the sea

 Higher and higher every day
 Till over the mast at noon
 The WeddingGuest here beat his breast
 For he heard the loud bassoon

 The bride hath paced into the hall
 Red as a rose is she
 Nodding their heads before her goes
 The merry minstrelsy

 The WeddingGuest he beat his breast
 Yet he cannot chuse but hear
 And thus spake on that ancient man
 The brighteyed Mariner

 And now the STORMBLAST came and he
 Was tyrannous and strong
 He struck with his oertaking wings
 And chased south along

 With sloping masts and dipping prow
 As who pursued with yell and blow
 Still treads the shadow of his foe
 And forward bends his head
 The ship drove fast loud roared the blast
 And southward aye we fled

 And now there came both mist and snow
 And it grew wondrous cold
 And ice masthigh came floating by
 As green as emerald

 And through the drifts the snowy clifts
 Did send a dismal sheen
 Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken
 The ice was all between

 The ice was here the ice was there
 The ice was all around
 It cracked and growled and roared and howled
 Like noises in a swound

 At length did cross an Albatross
 Thorough the fog it came
 As if it had been a Christian soul
 We hailed it in Gods name

 It ate the food it neer had eat
 And round and round it flew
 The ice did split with a thunderfit
 The helmsman steered us through

 And a good south wind sprung up behind
 The Albatross did follow
 And every day for food or play
 Came to the mariners hollo

 In mist or cloud on mast or shroud
 It perched for vespers nine
 Whiles all the night through fogsmoke white
 Glimmered the white Moonshine

 God save thee ancient Mariner
 From the fiends that plague thee thus
 Why lookst thou soWith my crossbow
 I shot the ALBATROSS




PART THE SECOND

 The Sun now rose upon the right
 Out of the sea came he
 Still hid in mist and on the left
 Went down into the sea

 And the good south wind still blew behind
 But no sweet bird did follow
 Nor any day for food or play
 Came to the mariners hollo

 And I had done an hellish thing
 And it would work em woe
 For all averred I had killed the bird
 That made the breeze to blow
 Ah wretch said they the bird to slay
 That made the breeze to blow

 Nor dim nor red like Gods own head
 The glorious Sun uprist
 Then all averred I had killed the bird
 That brought the fog and mist
 Twas right said they such birds to slay
 That bring the fog and mist

 The fair breeze blew the white foam flew
 The furrow followed free
 We were the first that ever burst
 Into that silent sea

 Down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down
 Twas sad as sad could be
 And we did speak only to break
 The silence of the sea

 All in a hot and copper sky
 The bloody Sun at noon
 Right up above the mast did stand
 No bigger than the Moon

 Day after day day after day
 We stuck nor breath nor motion
 As idle as a painted ship
 Upon a painted ocean

 Water water every where
 And all the boards did shrink
 Water water every where
 Nor any drop to drink

 The very deep did rot O Christ
 That ever this should be
 Yea slimy things did crawl with legs
 Upon the slimy sea

 About about in reel and rout
 The deathfires danced at night
 The water like a witchs oils
 Burnt green and blue and white

 And some in dreams assured were
 Of the spirit that plagued us so
 Nine fathom deep he had followed us
 From the land of mist and snow

 And every tongue through utter drought
 Was withered at the root
 We could not speak no more than if
 We had been choked with soot

 Ah well aday what evil looks
 Had I from old and young
 Instead of the cross the Albatross
 About my neck was hung




PART THE THIRD

 There passed a weary time Each throat
 Was parched and glazed each eye
 A weary time a weary time
 How glazed each weary eye
 When looking westward I beheld
 A something in the sky

 At first it seemed a little speck
 And then it seemed a mist
 It moved and moved and took at last
 A certain shape I wist

 A speck a mist a shape I wist
 And still it neared and neared
 As if it dodged a watersprite
 It plunged and tacked and veered

 With throats unslaked with black lips baked
 We could not laugh nor wail
 Through utter drought all dumb we stood
 I bit my arm I sucked the blood
 And cried A sail a sail

 With throats unslaked with black lips baked
 Agape they heard me call
 Gramercy they for joy did grin
 And all at once their breath drew in
 As they were drinking all

 See see I cried she tacks no more
 Hither to work us weal
 Without a breeze without a tide
 She steadies with upright keel

 The western wave was all aflame
 The day was well nigh done
 Almost upon the western wave
 Rested the broad bright Sun
 When that strange shape drove suddenly
 Betwixt us and the Sun

 And straight the Sun was flecked with bars
 Heavens Mother send us grace
 As if through a dungeongrate he peered
 With broad and burning face

 Alas thought I and my heart beat loud
 How fast she nears and nears
 Are those her sails that glance in the Sun
 Like restless gossameres

 Are those her ribs through which the Sun
 Did peer as through a grate
 And is that Woman all her crew
 Is that a DEATH and are there two
 Is DEATH that womans mate

 Her lips were red her looks were free
 Her locks were yellow as gold
 Her skin was as white as leprosy
 The NightMare LIFEINDEATH was she
 Who thicks mans blood with cold

 The naked hulk alongside came
 And the twain were casting dice
 The game is done Ive won Ive won
 Quoth she and whistles thrice

 The Suns rim dips the stars rush out
 At one stride comes the dark
 With farheard whisper oer the sea
 Off shot the spectrebark

 We listened and looked sideways up
 Fear at my heart as at a cup
 My lifeblood seemed to sip

 The stars were dim and thick the night
 The steersmans face by his lamp gleamed white
 From the sails the dew did drip
 Till clombe above the eastern bar
 The horned Moon with one bright star
 Within the nether tip

 One after one by the stardogged Moon
 Too quick for groan or sigh
 Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
 And cursed me with his eye

 Four times fifty living men
 And I heard nor sigh nor groan
 With heavy thump a lifeless lump
 They dropped down one by one

 The souls did from their bodies fly
 They fled to bliss or woe
 And every soul it passed me by
 Like the whizz of my CROSSBOW




PART THE FOURTH

 I fear thee ancient Mariner
 I fear thy skinny hand
 And thou art long and lank and brown
 As is the ribbed seasand

 I fear thee and thy glittering eye
 And thy skinny hand so brown
 Fear not fear not thou WeddingGuest
 This body dropt not down

 Alone alone all all alone
 Alone on a wide wide sea
 And never a saint took pity on
 My soul in agony

 The many men so beautiful
 And they all dead did lie
 And a thousand thousand slimy things
 Lived on and so did I

 I looked upon the rotting sea
 And drew my eyes away
 I looked upon the rotting deck
 And there the dead men lay

 I looked to Heaven and tried to pray
 But or ever a prayer had gusht
 A wicked whisper came and made
 my heart as dry as dust

 I closed my lids and kept them close
 And the balls like pulses beat
 For the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky
 Lay like a load on my weary eye
 And the dead were at my feet

 The cold sweat melted from their limbs
 Nor rot nor reek did they
 The look with which they looked on me
 Had never passed away

 An orphans curse would drag to Hell
 A spirit from on high
 But oh more horrible than that
 Is a curse in a dead mans eye
 Seven days seven nights I saw that curse
 And yet I could not die

 The moving Moon went up the sky
 And no where did abide
 Softly she was going up
 And a star or two beside

 Her beams bemocked the sultry main
 Like April hoarfrost spread
 But where the ships huge shadow lay
 The charmed water burnt alway
 A still and awful red

 Beyond the shadow of the ship
 I watched the watersnakes
 They moved in tracks of shining white
 And when they reared the elfish light
 Fell off in hoary flakes

 Within the shadow of the ship
 I watched their rich attire
 Blue glossy green and velvet black
 They coiled and swam and every track
 Was a flash of golden fire

 O happy living things no tongue
 Their beauty might declare
 A spring of love gushed from my heart
 And I blessed them unaware
 Sure my kind saint took pity on me
 And I blessed them unaware

 The self same moment I could pray
 And from my neck so free
 The Albatross fell off and sank
 Like lead into the sea




PART THE FIFTH

 Oh sleep it is a gentle thing
 Beloved from pole to pole
 To Mary Queen the praise be given
 She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven
 That slid into my soul

 The silly buckets on the deck
 That had so long remained
 I dreamt that they were filled with dew
 And when I awoke it rained

 My lips were wet my throat was cold
 My garments all were dank
 Sure I had drunken in my dreams
 And still my body drank

 I moved and could not feel my limbs
 I was so lightalmost
 I thought that I had died in sleep
 And was a blessed ghost

 And soon I heard a roaring wind
 It did not come anear
 But with its sound it shook the sails
 That were so thin and sere

 The upper air burst into life
 And a hundred fireflags sheen
 To and fro they were hurried about
 And to and fro and in and out
 The wan stars danced between

 And the coming wind did roar more loud
 And the sails did sigh like sedge
 And the rain poured down from one black cloud
 The Moon was at its edge

 The thick black cloud was cleft and still
 The Moon was at its side
 Like waters shot from some high crag
 The lightning fell with never a jag
 A river steep and wide

 The loud wind never reached the ship
 Yet now the ship moved on
 Beneath the lightning and the Moon
 The dead men gave a groan

 They groaned they stirred they all uprose
 Nor spake nor moved their eyes
 It had been strange even in a dream
 To have seen those dead men rise

 The helmsman steered the ship moved on
 Yet never a breeze up blew
 The mariners all gan work the ropes
 Where they were wont to do
 They raised their limbs like lifeless tools
 We were a ghastly crew

 The body of my brothers son
 Stood by me knee to knee
 The body and I pulled at one rope
 But he said nought to me

 I fear thee ancient Mariner
 Be calm thou WeddingGuest
 Twas not those souls that fled in pain
 Which to their corses came again
 But a troop of spirits blest

 For when it dawnedthey dropped their arms
 And clustered round the mast
 Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths
 And from their bodies passed

 Around around flew each sweet sound
 Then darted to the Sun
 Slowly the sounds came back again
 Now mixed now one by one

 Sometimes adropping from the sky
 I heard the skylark sing
 Sometimes all little birds that are
 How they seemed to fill the sea and air
 With their sweet jargoning

 And now twas like all instruments
 Now like a lonely flute
 And now it is an angels song
 That makes the Heavens be mute

 It ceased yet still the sails made on
 A pleasant noise till noon
 A noise like of a hidden brook
 In the leafy month of June
 That to the sleeping woods all night
 Singeth a quiet tune

 Till noon we quietly sailed on
 Yet never a breeze did breathe
 Slowly and smoothly went the ship
 Moved onward from beneath

 Under the keel nine fathom deep
 From the land of mist and snow
 The spirit slid and it was he
 That made the ship to go
 The sails at noon left off their tune
 And the ship stood still also

 The Sun right up above the mast
 Had fixed her to the ocean
 But in a minute she gan stir
 With a short uneasy motion
 Backwards and forwards half her length
 With a short uneasy motion

 Then like a pawing horse let go
 She made a sudden bound
 It flung the blood into my head
 And I fell down in a swound

 How long in that same fit I lay
 I have not to declare
 But ere my living life returned
 I heard and in my soul discerned
 Two VOICES in the air

 Is it he quoth one Is this the man
 By him who died on cross
 With his cruel bow he laid full low
 The harmless Albatross

 The spirit who bideth by himself
 In the land of mist and snow
 He loved the bird that loved the man
 Who shot him with his bow

 The other was a softer voice
 As soft as honeydew
 Quoth he The man hath penance done
 And penance more will do




PART THE SIXTH


 FIRST VOICE

 But tell me tell me speak again
 Thy soft response renewing
 What makes that ship drive on so fast
 What is the OCEAN doing


 SECOND VOICE

 Still as a slave before his lord
 The OCEAN hath no blast
 His great bright eye most silently
 Up to the Moon is cast

 If he may know which way to go
 For she guides him smooth or grim
 See brother see how graciously
 She looketh down on him


 FIRST VOICE

 But why drives on that ship so fast
 Without or wave or wind


 SECOND VOICE

 The air is cut away before
 And closes from behind

 Fly brother fly more high more high
 Or we shall be belated
 For slow and slow that ship will go
 When the Mariners trance is abated

 I woke and we were sailing on
 As in a gentle weather
 Twas night calm night the Moon was high
 The dead men stood together

 All stood together on the deck
 For a charneldungeon fitter
 All fixed on me their stony eyes
 That in the Moon did glitter

 The pang the curse with which they died
 Had never passed away
 I could not draw my eyes from theirs
 Nor turn them up to pray

 And now this spell was snapt once more
 I viewed the ocean green
 And looked far forth yet little saw
 Of what had else been seen

 Like one that on a lonesome road
 Doth walk in fear and dread
 And having once turned round walks on
 And turns no more his head
 Because he knows a frightful fiend
 Doth close behind him tread

 But soon there breathed a wind on me
 Nor sound nor motion made
 Its path was not upon the sea
 In ripple or in shade

 It raised my hair it fanned my cheek
 Like a meadowgale of spring
 It mingled strangely with my fears
 Yet it felt like a welcoming

 Swiftly swiftly flew the ship
 Yet she sailed softly too
 Sweetly sweetly blew the breeze
 On me alone it blew

 Oh dream of joy is this indeed
 The lighthouse top I see
 Is this the hill is this the kirk
 Is this mine own countree

 We drifted oer the harbourbar
 And I with sobs did pray
 O let me be awake my God
 Or let me sleep alway

 The harbourbay was clear as glass
 So smoothly it was strewn
 And on the bay the moonlight lay
 And the shadow of the moon

 The rock shone bright the kirk no less
 That stands above the rock
 The moonlight steeped in silentness
 The steady weathercock

 And the bay was white with silent light
 Till rising from the same
 Full many shapes that shadows were
 In crimson colours came

 A little distance from the prow
 Those crimson shadows were
 I turned my eyes upon the deck
 Oh Christ what saw I there

 Each corse lay flat lifeless and flat
 And by the holy rood
 A man all light a seraphman
 On every corse there stood

 This seraph band each waved his hand
 It was a heavenly sight
 They stood as signals to the land
 Each one a lovely light

 This seraphband each waved his hand
 No voice did they impart
 No voice but oh the silence sank
 Like music on my heart

 But soon I heard the dash of oars
 I heard the Pilots cheer
 My head was turned perforce away
 And I saw a boat appear

 The Pilot and the Pilots boy
 I heard them coming fast
 Dear Lord in Heaven it was a joy
 The dead men could not blast

 I saw a thirdI heard his voice
 It is the Hermit good
 He singeth loud his godly hymns
 That he makes in the wood
 Hell shrieve my soul hell wash away
 The Albatrosss blood




PART THE SEVENTH

 This Hermit good lives in that wood
 Which slopes down to the sea
 How loudly his sweet voice he rears
 He loves to talk with marineres
 That come from a far countree

 He kneels at morn and noon and eve
 He hath a cushion plump
 It is the moss that wholly hides
 The rotted old oakstump

 The skiffboat neared I heard them talk
 Why this is strange I trow
 Where are those lights so many and fair
 That signal made but now

 Strange by my faith the Hermit said
 And they answered not our cheer
 The planks looked warped and see those sails
 How thin they are and sere
 I never saw aught like to them
 Unless perchance it were

 Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
 My forestbrook along
 When the ivytod is heavy with snow
 And the owlet whoops to the wolf below
 That eats the shewolfs young

 Dear Lord it hath a fiendish look
 The Pilot made reply
 I am afearedPush on push on
 Said the Hermit cheerily

 The boat came closer to the ship
 But I nor spake nor stirred
 The boat came close beneath the ship
 And straight a sound was heard

 Under the water it rumbled on
 Still louder and more dread
 It reached the ship it split the bay
 The ship went down like lead

 Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound
 Which sky and ocean smote
 Like one that hath been seven days drowned
 My body lay afloat
 But swift as dreams myself I found
 Within the Pilots boat

 Upon the whirl where sank the ship
 The boat spun round and round
 And all was still save that the hill
 Was telling of the sound

 I moved my lipsthe Pilot shrieked
 And fell down in a fit
 The holy Hermit raised his eyes
 And prayed where he did sit

 I took the oars the Pilots boy
 Who now doth crazy go
 Laughed loud and long and all the while
 His eyes went to and fro
 Ha ha quoth he full plain I see
 The Devil knows how to row

 And now all in my own countree
 I stood on the firm land
 The Hermit stepped forth from the boat
 And scarcely he could stand

 O shrieve me shrieve me holy man
 The Hermit crossed his brow
 Say quick quoth he I bid thee say
 What manner of man art thou

 Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
 With a woeful agony
 Which forced me to begin my tale
 And then it left me free

 Since then at an uncertain hour
 That agony returns
 And till my ghastly tale is told
 This heart within me burns

 I pass like night from land to land
 I have strange power of speech
 That moment that his face I see
 I know the man that must hear me
 To him my tale I teach

 What loud uproar bursts from that door
 The weddingguests are there
 But in the gardenbower the bride
 And bridemaids singing are
 And hark the little vesper bell
 Which biddeth me to prayer

 O WeddingGuest this soul hath been
 Alone on a wide wide sea
 So lonely twas that God himself
 Scarce seemed there to be

 O sweeter than the marriagefeast
 Tis sweeter far to me
 To walk together to the kirk
 With a goodly company

 To walk together to the kirk
 And all together pray
 While each to his great Father bends
 Old men and babes and loving friends
 And youths and maidens gay

 Farewell farewell but this I tell
 To thee thou WeddingGuest
 He prayeth well who loveth well
 Both man and bird and beast

 He prayeth best who loveth best
 All things both great and small
 For the dear God who loveth us
 He made and loveth all

 The Mariner whose eye is bright
 Whose beard with age is hoar
 Is gone and now the WeddingGuest
 Turned from the bridegrooms door

 He went like one that hath been stunned
 And is of sense forlorn
 A sadder and a wiser man
 He rose the morrow morn

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
