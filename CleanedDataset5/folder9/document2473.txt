MARYGUSTA




CHAPTER I


On the twentieth day of April in the year 19 the peoplethat is a
majority of the grown people of Ostablewere talking of Marcellus Hall
and MaryGusta

A part of this statement is not surprising The average person no
matter how humble or obscure is pretty certain to be talked about on
the day of his funeral and Marcellus was to be buried that afternoon
Moreover Marcellus had been neither humble nor obscure also he had
been talked about a good deal during the fiftynine years of his sojourn
on this planet So it is not at all surprising that he should be talked
about now when that sojourn was ended But for all Ostableyes and a
large part of South Harnissto be engaged in speculation concerning the
future of MaryGusta was surprising for prior to Marcelluss death
very few outside of the Hall household had given her or her future a
thought

On this day however whenever or wherever the name of Marcellus Hall
was mentioned after the disposition of Marcelluss own bones had been
discussed and those of his family skeleton disinterred and articulated
the conversation in at least eight cases out of ten resolved itself
into a guessing contest having as its problem this query

Whats goin to become of that child

For example

Mr Bethuel Sparrow local newsgatherer for the Ostable Enterprise
seated before his desk in the editorial sanctum was writing an obituary
for next weeks paper under the following head

A Prominent Citizen Passes Away

An ordinary man would probably have written Dies but Mr Sparrow
being a young and very new reporter for a rural weekly wrote Passes
Away as more elegant and less shocking to the reader

It is much more soothing and refined to pass away than to dieunless
one happens to be the person most concerned in which case perhaps it
may make little difference

The Angel of Death wrote Mr Sparrow passed through our midst on
Tuesday last and called to his reward Captain Marcellus Hall one of
Ostables most wellknown and influential residents

A slight exaggeration here Marcellus had lived in Ostable but five
years altogether and during the last three had taken absolutely
no part in town affairspolitical religious or social However
influential is a good word and usual in obituaries so Bethuel let it
stand He continued

Captain Halls sudden death

Erasure of death and substitution of demise

Then

Was a shock to the community at large It happened on account of
More erasures and substitutions It was the result of his taking cold
owing to exposure during the heavy southeast rains of week before last
which developed into pneumonia He grew rapidly worse and passed away at
306 PM on Tuesday leaving a vacancy in our midst which will be hard
to fill if at all Although Captain Hall had resided in Ostable but a
comparatively short period he was wellknown and respected both as a
man and

Here invention failing Mr Sparrow called for assistance

Hey Perce he hailed addressing his companion Mr Percy Clark who
was busy setting type Whats a good word to use here I say Marcellus
was respected both as a manand somethin else

Hey queried Percy absently scanning the eight point case What
dye say

I asked you what would be a good thing to go with man

Hey I dont know Woman I guess

Aw cut it out Never mind I got it

As a man and a citizen Captain Hall was fiftynine years of age at
the time of his demise He was born in South Harniss and followed the
sea until 1871 when he founded the firm of Hall and Company which was
for some years the leading dealer in fresh and salt fish in this section
of the state When the firm

I say Perce Twouldnt do to say Marcellus failed in business would
it Might seem like hintin at that stuff about his sister and the rest
of it Might get us into trouble eh

Humph I dont know who with Everybodys talkin about it anyway Up
to the boardin house theyve been talking about mighty little else ever
since he died

I know but talks one thing and prints another Im goin to leave it
out

When the firm went out of business in 1879 Captain Hall followed the
sea again commanding the ships Faraway Fair Wind and Treasure Seeker
and the bark Apollo Later he retired from the sea and has not been
active in the same or otherwise since In 1894 he married Augusta Bangs
Lathrop widow of the late Reverend Charles Lathrop formerly pastor of
the Congregational Church in this town Captain Hall had been residing
in his native town South Harniss but after his marriage he took up
his residence in Ostable purchasing the residence formerly owned by
Elnathan Phinney on Phinneys Hill where he lived until his lamented
demise Mrs Hall passed away in 1896 The sudden removal of Captain
Hall from our midst leaves a stepdaughter Mary Augusta Lathrop aged
seven The

Here Mr Sparrows train of thought collided with the obstruction which
was derailing many similar trains in Ostable and South Harniss

I say Perce he observed whats goin to become of that kid of
Marcellusshis wifes I mean Marcellus didnt have any relations as
far as anybody knows and neither did his wife Whos goin to take care
of MaryGusta

Percy shook his head Dont know he answered Thats what all hands
are askin I presume likely shell be looked after Marcellus left
plenty of money didnt he And kids with money can generally find
guardians

Yup I guess thats so Still whoever gets her will have their hands
full Shes the most oldfashioned queerest youngone ever I saw


So much for Mr Sparrow and his fellow laborer for the Enterprise Now
to listen for a moment to Judge Baxter who led the legal profession
of Ostable and to Mrs Baxter who so common report affirmed led the
Judge The pair were upstairs in the Baxter house dressing for the
funeral

Daniel declared Mrs Baxter its the queerest thing I ever heard
of You say they dont knoweither of themand the child herself
doesnt know either

Thats it Ophelia No one knows except myself Captain Hall read the
letter to me and put it in my charge a year ago

Well I must say

Yes I know I said it at the time and Ive been saying it to myself
ever since It doesnt mean anything that is it is not binding
legally of course Its absolutely unbusinesslike and unpractical
Simply a letter asking them as old friends to do this thing Whether
they will or not the Almighty only knows

Well Daniel I must say I shouldnt have thought you as his lawyer
would have let him do such a thing Of course I dont know either of
them very well but from what little Ive heard I should say they
know as much about what they would be supposed to do asas you do about
tying a necktie For mercy sakes let me fix it The knot is supposed to
be under your chin not under your ear as if you were going to be hung

The Judge meekly elevated the chin and his wife pulled the tie into
place

And so she said they can say yes or no just as they like

Yes it rests entirely with them

And suppose they say no what will become of the child then

I cant tell you Captain Hall seemed pretty certain they wouldnt say
no

Humph There Now you look a little more presentable Have you got a
clean handkerchief Well thats an unexpected miracle I dont know how
you happened to think of it When are you going to speak with them about
it

Today if they come to the funeral as I suppose they will

I shall be in a fidget until I know whether they say yes or no And
whichever they say I shall keep on fidgeting until I see what happens
after that Poor little MaryGusta I wonder what WILL become of her

The Judge shook his head


Over the road between South Harniss and Ostable a buggy drawn by an aged
white horse was moving slowly On the buggys seat were two men Captain
Shadrach Gould and Zoeth Hamilton Captain Gould big stout and
bearded was driving Mr Hamilton small thin smoothfaced and
whitehaired was beside him Both were obviously dressed in their
Sunday clothes Captain Shadrachs blue Mr Hamiltons black Each wore
an uncomfortably high collar and the shoes of each had been laboriously
polished Their faces utterly unlike in most respects were very
solemn

Ah hum sighed Mr Hamilton

Captain Shadrach snorted impatiently

For the land sakes dont do that again Zoeth he protested Thats
the tenth Ah hum youve cast loose in a mile I know were bound to a
funeral but there aint no need of tollin the bell all the way I dont
like it and I dont think Marcellus would neither if he could hear
you

Perhaps he can hear us Shadrach suggested his companion mildly
Perhaps hes here with us now who can tell

Humph Well if he is then I KNOW he dont like it Marcellus never
made any fuss whatever happened and he wouldnt make any at his own
funeral no more than at anybody elses That wasnt his way Say nothin
and keep her on the course that was Marcellus I swan I can hardly make
it seem possible that hes gone

Neither can I Shadrach And to think that you and me his old partners
and lifelong chums as you might say hadnt seen nor spoken to him
for over two years It makes me feel bad Bad and sort of
consciencestruck

I know so it does me in a way And yet it wasnt our fault Zoeth
You know as well as I do that Marcellus didnt want to see us We was
over to see him last and he scarcely said a word while we was there
You and me did all the talkin and he just set and looked at uswhen
he wasnt lookin at the floor I never saw such a change in a man We
askedyes by fire we fairly begged him to come and stay with us for
a spell but he never did Now it aint no further from Ostable to South
Harniss than it is from South Harniss to Ostable If hed wanted to come
he could if hed wanted to see us he could We went to see him
didnt we and WE had a store and a business to leave He aint had any
business since he give up goin to sea He

Sshh Shh interrupted Mr Hamilton mildly dont talk that way
Shadrach Dont find fault with the dead

Find fault I aint findin fault I thought as much of Marcellus Hall
as any man on earth and nobody feels worse about his bein took than
I do But Im just sayin what we both knows a fact He didnt want to
see us he didnt want to see nobody Since his wife died he lived alone
in that house except for a housekeeper and that stepchild and never
went anywhere or had anybody come to see him if he could help it A
reglar hermitthats what he was a hermit like Peleg Myrick down
to Setuckit Pint And when I think what he used to be smart lively
able one of the best skippers and smartest business men afloat or
ashore it dont seem possible a body could change so Twas that woman
that done it that woman that trapped him into gettin married

Sshh Shh Shadrach shes dead too And besides I guess she was a
real good woman everybody said she was

I aint sayin she wasnt am I What I say is she hadnt no business
marryin a man twenty years oldern she was

But mildly you said she trapped him Now we dont know

Zoeth Hamilton you know she must have trapped him You and I agreed
that was just what she done If she hadnt trapped himset a reglar
seine for him and hauled him aboard like a school of mackereltaint
likely hed have married her or anybody else is it I aint married
nobody have I And Marcellus was years oldern I be

Well well Shadrach

No taint well its bad Hes gone andand you and me that was
with him for years and years his very best friends on earth as you
might say wasnt with him when he died If it hadnt been for her hed
have stayed in South Harniss where he belonged Consarn women Theyre
responsible for more cussedness than the smallpox When a man marries
his trouble begins thats gospel too

Zoeth did not answer

Captain Gould after a sidelong glance at his companion took a hand
from the reins and laid it on the Hamilton knee

Im sorry Zoeth he said contritely I didnt mean toto rake up
bygones I was blowin off steam thats all Im sorry

I know Shadrach Its all right

No taint all right its all wrong Somebody ought to keep a watch
on me and when they see me beginnin to get hot set me on the back of
the stove or somewheres Im always liable to bile over and scald the
wrong critter Ive done that all my life Im sorry Zoeth you know I
didnt mean

I know I know Ah hum Poor Marcellus Heres the first break in the
old firm Shadrach

Yup You and me are all thats left of Hall and Company That is

He stopped short just in time and roared a Git dap at the horse He
had been on the point of saying something which would have been far more
disastrous than his reference to the troubles following marriage Zoeth
was apparently not curious To his friends great relief he did not wait
for the sentence to be finished nor did he ask embarrassing questions
Instead he said

I wonder whats goin to become of that child Mary Lathrops girl Who
do you suppose likely will take charge of her

I dont know Ive been wonderin that myself Zoeth

Kind of a cute little thing she was too as I recollect her I
presume likely shes grown up considble since You remember how she set
and looked at us that last time we was over to see Marcellus Shadrach

Remember How she looked at ME you mean Shall I ever forget it Id
just had my hair cut by that new barber Sim Ellis that lived here
long about then and I told him to cut off the ends He thought I meant
the other ends I callate for I went to sleep in the chair same as I
generally do and when I woke up my head looked like the main truck of
the old Faraway All it needed was to have the bald place gilded I give
you my word that if I hadnt been born with my ears set wing and wing
like a schooner runnin afore the wind Id have been smothered when I
put my hat onnothin but them ears kept it propped up off my nose
YOU remember that haircut Zoeth Well all the time you and me was in
Marcelluss settinroom that stepchild of his just set and looked at my
head Never took her eyes off it If shed said anything twouldnt
have been so bad but she didntjust looked I could feel my bald spot
reddenin up till I swan to man I thought it must be breakin out in
blisters Never see anybody that looked just like me did you Sis I
says to her when I couldnt stand it any longer No sir she says
solemn as an owl She was right out and honest Ill say that for her
Thats the only time Marcellus laughed while we was inside that house
I didnt blame him much Ho ho Well he aint laughin now and neither
are weor we hadnt ought to be Neither is the child I callate poor
thing I wonder what will become of her


And meanwhile the child herself was vaguely and in childish fashion
wondering that very thing She was in the carriage room of the barn
belonging to the Hall estateif the few acres of land and the buildings
owned by the late Marcellus may be called an estatecurled up on the
back seat of the old surrey which had been used so little since the
death of her mother Augusta Hall four years before The surrey was
shrouded from top to floor with a dust cover of unbleached muslin
through which the sunshine from the carriage room windows filtered in a
mysterious softened twilight The covered surrey was a favorite retreat
of MaryGustas She had discovered it herselfwhich made it doubly
alluring of courseand she seldom invited her juvenile friends to
share its curtained privacy with her It was her playhouse her tent
and her enchanted castle much too sacred to be made common property
Here she came on rainy Saturdays and on many days not rainy when other
children those possessing brothers or sisters played out of doors She
liked to play by herself to invent plays all her own and these other
childrennormal children their parents called themwere much
too likely to laugh instead of solemnly making believe as she did
MaryGusta was not a normal child she was that queer Lathrop
youngonehad heard herself so described more than once She did not
like the phrase queer was not so badperhaps she was queerbut she
had an instinctive repugnance to being called a youngone Birds and
rabbits had youngones and she was neither feathered nor furred

So very few of the neighborhood children were invited to the shaded
interior of the old surrey Her dollsall five of themspent a good
deal of time there and David the tortoiseshell cat came often
usually under compulsion When David had kittens which interesting
domestic event took place pretty frequently heor shepositively
refused to be an occupant of that surrey growling and scratching in a
decidedly ungentlemanlyor unladylikemanner Twice MaryGusta had
attempted to make David more complacent by bringing the kittens also to
the surrey but their parent had promptly and consecutively seized
them by the scruff of their necks and laboriously lugged them up to the
haymow again

Just now however there being no kittens David was slumbering in
a furry heap beside MaryGusta at one end of the carriage seat and
Rosette the smallest of the five dolls and Rose the largest were
sitting bolt upright in the corner at the other end The christening of
the smallest and newest doll was the result of a piece of characteristic
reasoning on its owners part She was very fond of the name Rose the
same being the name of the heroine in Eight Cousins which story Mrs
Bailey housekeeper before last for Marcellus Hall had read aloud to
the child When the new doll came at Christmas time MaryGusta wished
that she might christen it Rose also But there was another and much
beloved Rose already in the family So MaryGusta reflected and
observed and she observed that a big roll of tobacco such as her
stepfather smoked was a cigar while a little one as smoked by Eben
Keeler the grocers delivery clerk was a cigarette Therefore the big
doll being already Rose the little one became Rosette

MaryGusta was not playing with Rose and Rosette at the present time
Neither was she interested in the peaceful slumbers of David She was
not playing at all but sitting with feet crossed beneath her on the
seat and hands clasped about one knee thinking And although she was
thinking of her stepfather who she knew had gone away to a vague place
called Heavena place variously described by Mrs Bailey the former
housekeeper and by Mrs Susan Hobbs the present one and by Mr Howes
the Sunday school superintendentshe was thinking most of herself Mary
Augusta Lathrop who was going to a funeral that very afternoon and
after that no one seemed to know exactly where

It was a beautiful April day and the doors of the carriage house and
the big door of the barn were wide open MaryGusta could hear the hens
clucking and the voices of people talking The voices were two one was
that of Mrs Hobbs the housekeeper and the other belonged to Mr Abner
Hallett the undertaker MaryGusta did not like Mr Halletts voice
she liked neither it nor its owners manner she described both voice
and manner to herself as too soothy They gave her the shivers

Mr Halletts tone was subdued at the present time but a trifle of the
professional soothiness was lacking He and Mrs Hobbs were conversing
briskly enough and although MaryGusta could catch only a word or two
at intervals she was perfectly sure they were talking about her She
was certain that if she were to appear at that moment in the door of the
barn they would stop talking immediately and look at her Everybody whom
she had met during the past two days looked at her in that queer way It
made her feel as if she had something catching like the measles and as
if somehow or other she was to blame

She realized dimly that she should feel very very badly because her
stepfather was dead Mrs Hobbs had told her that she should and seemed
to regard her as queerer than ever because she had not cried But
according to the housekeeper Captain Hall was out of his troubles and
had gone where he would be happy for ever and ever So it seemed to her
strange to be expected to cry on his account He had not been happy
here in Ostable or at least he had not shown his happiness in the way
other people showed theirs To her he had been a big bearded giant of
a man whom she saw at infrequent intervals during the day and always
at night just before she went to bed His room with the oldfashioned
secretary against the wall and the stuffed gull on the shelf and the
books in the cupboard and the polished narwhal horn in the corner was
to her a sort of holy of holies a place where she was led each evening
at nine oclock at first by Mrs Bailey and later by Mrs Hobbs
to shake the hand of the big man who looked at her absently over his
spectacles and said good night in a voice not unkindly but expressing no
particular interest At other times she was strictly forbidden to enter
that room

Occasionally but very rarely she had eaten Sunday dinner with
Marcellus She and the housekeeper usually ate together and Mr Halls
meals were served in what the child called the smoke room meaning the
apartment just described which was at all times strongly scented with
tobacco The Sunday dinners were stately and formal affairs and were
prefaced by lectures by the housekeeper concerning sitting up straight
and not disturbing Capn Hall by talking too much On the whole
MaryGusta was rather glad when the meals were over She did not
dislike her stepfather he had never been rough or unkind but she had
always stood in awe of him and had felt that he regarded her as a pesky
nuisance something to be fed and then shooed out of the way as Mrs
Hobbs regarded David the cat As for loving him as other children
seemed to love their fathers that the girl never did She was sure
he did not love her in that way and that he would not have welcomed
demonstrations of affection on her part She had learned the reason or
she thought she had she was a STEPCHILD that was why and a stepchild
was almost as bad as a changeling in a fairy story

Her mother she remembered dimly and with that recollection were memories
of days when she was loved and made much of not only by Mother but by
Captain Hall also She asked Mrs Bailey whom she had loved and whose
leaving was the greatest grief of her life some questions about these
memories Mrs Bailey had hugged her and had talked a good deal about
Captain Halls being a changed man since his wifes death He used to
be so different jolly and goodnatured and sociable you wouldnt know
him now if you seen him then When your mamma was took it just seemed to
wilt him right down He was awful sick himself for a spell and when
he got better he was like he is today Seems as if HE died too as
you might say and aint really lived since Im awful sorry for Capn
Marcellus You must be real good to him when you grow up MaryGusta

And now he had gone before she had had a chance to grow up and
MaryGusta felt an unreasonable sense of blame But real grief the
dreadful paralyzing realization of loss which an adult feels when a dear
one dies she did not feel

She was awed and a little frightened but she did not feel like crying
Why should she

MaryGusta MaryGusta Where be you

It was Mrs Hobbs calling MaryGusta hurriedly untwisted her legs
and scrambled from beneath the dust cover of the surrey David whose
slumbers were disturbed rose also yawned and stretched

Here I be Mrs Hobbs answered the girl Im acomin

Mrs Hobbs was standing in the doorway of the barn MaryGusta noticed
that she was not as usual garbed in gingham but was arrayed in her
best gotomeeting gown

Im acomin said the child

Comin yes But where on earth have you been Ive been hunting all
over creation for you I didnt suppose youd be out here on this day
of all others withwith that critter indicating David who appeared
blinking sleepily

I must say I shouldnt think youd be fussin along with a cat today
declared Mrs Hobbs

Yesm said MaryGusta David yawned apparently expressing a bored
contempt for housekeepers in general

Come right along into the house continued Mrs Hobbs Its high time
you was gettin ready for the funeral

Ready How queried MaryGusta

Why changin your clothes of course

Do folks dress up for funerals

Course they do What a question

I didnt know IIve never had one

Had one

I mean Ive never been to any What do they dress up for

Whywhy because they do of course Now dont ask any more questions
but hurry up Where are you goin now for mercy sakes

I was goin back after Rose and Rosette They ought to be dressed up
too hadnt they

The idea Playin dolls today I declare I never see such a child
Youre a reglar littlelittle heathen Would you want anybody playin
dolls at your own funeral Id like to know

MaryGusta thought this over I dont know she answered after
reflection I guess Id just as soon Do they have dolls up in Heaven
Mrs Hobbs

Mercy on us I should say not Dolls in Heaven The idea

Nor cats either

No Dont ask such wicked questions

MaryGusta asked no more questions of that kind but her conviction
that HeavenMrs Hobbs Heavenwas a good place for housekeepers and
grownups but a poor one for children was strengthened

They entered the house by the kitchen door and ascended the back stairs
to MaryGustas room The shades in all the rooms were drawn and the
house was dark and gloomy The child would have asked the reason for
this but at the first hint of a question Mrs Hobbs bade her hush

You mustnt talk she said

Why mustnt I

Because taint the right thing to do thats why Now hurry up and get
dressed

MaryGusta silently wriggled out of her everyday frock was led to the
washstand and vigorously scrubbed Then Mrs Hobbs combed and braided
what she called her pigtails and tied a bow of black ribbon at the end
of each

There exclaimed the lady Youre clean for once in your life
anyhow Now hurry up and put on them things on the bed

The things were MaryGustas very best shoes and dress also a pair of
new black stockings

When the dressing was finished the housekeeper stood her in the middle
of the floor and walked about her on a final round of inspection

There she said again with a sigh of satisfaction Nobody can say
I aint took all the pains with you that anybody could Now you come
downstairs and set right where I tell you till I come And dont you say
one single word Not a word no matter what happens

She took the girls hand and led her down the front stairs As they
descended MaryGusta could scarcely restrain a gasp of surprise The
front door was openthe FRONT doorand the child had never seen it
open before had long ago decided that it was not a truly door at all
but merely a makebelieve like the painted windows on the sides of her
doll house But now it was wide open and Mr Hallett arrayed in a suit
of black the coat of which puckered under the arms was standing on the
threshold looking more soothy than ever The parlor door was open also
and the parlor itselfthe best first parlor more sacred and forbidden
even than the smoke roomwas as much of it as she could see filled
with chairs

Mrs Hobbs led her into the little room off the parlor the back
settinroom and indicating the haircloth and black walnut sofa
against the wall whispered to her to sit right there and not move

Mind now she whispered dont talk and dont stir Ill be back by
and by

MaryGusta left alone looked wideeyed about the little back
sittingroom It too was changed not changed as much as the front
parlor but changed nevertheless Most of the furniture had been
removed The most comfortable chairs including the rocker with the
parrot tidy on the back had been taken away One or two of the
boltupright variety remained and the music chair was still there but
pushed back into a corner

MaryGusta saw the music chair and a quiver of guilty fear tinged along
her spine that particular chair had always been to her the bright
particular glory of the house Not because it was beautiful for that it
distinctly was not but because of the marvellous secret hidden beneath
its upholstered seat Captain Marcellus had brought it home years and
years before when he was a seagoing bachelor and made voyages to
Hamburg In its normal condition it was a perfectly quiet and ugly
chair but there was a catch under one arm and a music box under the
seat And if that catch were released then when anyone sat in it the
music box played The Campbells Are Coming with spirit and jingle
And moreover kept on playing it to the finish unless the catch was
pushed back again

To MaryGusta that chair was a perpetual fascination She had been
expressly forbidden to touch it had been shut in the dark closet more
than once for touching it but nevertheless the temptation was always
there and she had yielded to that temptation at intervals when Mrs
Hobbs and her stepfather were out And the last time she had touched it
she had broken the catch She had wound up the music box after hearing
it play but the catch which made it a perfectly safe seat and not a
trap for the unwary had refused to push back into place And now
there it was loaded and primed so to speak and she was responsible
SupposeOh horrible thoughtsuppose anyone should sit in it that
afternoon

She gasped and jumped off the sofa Then she remembered Mrs Hobbs
parting command and stopped hesitating Mr Hallett standing at the
end of the hall by the front door heard her move and tiptoed to the
sittingroom

Whats the matter little girl he whispered soothingly

Nonothin gasped MaryGusta

Youre sure

Yeyes sir

All right Then you set down on the sofa and keep still You mustnt
make any noise The folks are comin now Set right down on the sofy
thats a good girl

So back to the sofa went MaryGusta trembling with apprehension From
her seat she could see along the hall and also through the other door
into the big settinroom where also there were rows of chairs
And to her horror these chairs began to fill People most of them
dressed in churchgoing garments which rattled and rustled were
tiptoeing in and sitting down where she could see them and they could
see her She did not dare to move now did not dare go near the music
chair even if going near it would have done any good She remained upon
the sofa and shivered

A few moments later Mrs Hobbs appeared looking very solemn and
Sundayfied and sat beside her Then Judge and Mrs Baxter were shown
into the little room and took two of the remaining chairs The Judge
bowed and smiled and Mrs Baxter leaned over and patted her hand
MaryGusta tried to smile too but succeeded only in looking more
miserable Mrs Hobbs whispered to her to sit up straight

There was a steady stream of people through the front door now They all
entered the parlor and many stayed there but others passed on into the
big settinroom The chairs there were almost all taken soon all
were taken and Mr Hallett was obliged to remove one of those in the
small room There were but two left empty one a tall straight antique
with a rush seat a family heirloom and the other the music chair
MaryGusta stared at the music chair and hoped and hoped

Mr Sharon the minister entered and shook hands with the Judge and
Mrs Baxter and with Mrs Hobbs and MaryGusta He also patted the
childs hand Mrs Hobbs whispered to him with evident pride that it
was goin to be one of the biggest funerals ever given in Ostable Mr
Sharon nodded Then after waiting a moment or two he tiptoed along the
front hall and took up his stand by the parlor door There was a final
rustle of gowns a final crackle of Sunday shirtfronts and then a
hushed silence

The silence was broken by the rattle of wheels in the yard Mr Hallett
at the door held up a warning hand A moment later he ushered two people
in at the front door and led them through the parlor into the big
settinroom MaryGusta could see the late comers plainly They were
both men one big and redfaced and bearded the other small and thin
and whitehaired A rustle passed through the crowd and everyone turned
to look Some looked as if they recognized the pair but they did not
bow evidently it was not proper to bow at funerals

Mr Hallett on tiptoe of course glided into the little room from
the big one and looked about him Then to the absolute stupefaction
of MaryGusta he took the rushseated chair in one hand and the music
chair in the other and tiptoed out He placed the two chairs in the back
row close to the door of the smaller room and motioned to the two men to
sit

MaryGusta could stand it no longer She was afraid of Mrs Hobbs
afraid of Mr Hallett afraid of the Baxters and all the staring crowd
but she was more afraid of what was going to happen She tugged at the
housekeepers sleeve

Mrs Hobbs she whispered quiveringly Oh Mrs Hobbs

Mrs Hobbs shook off the clutch at her sleeve

Sshh she whispered Sshh

Butbut please Mrs Hobbs

Sshh You mustnt talk Be still Be still I tell you

The small whitehaired man sat down in the rushseated chair The big
man hesitated separated his coat tails and then he too sat down

And the music box under the seat of the chair he sat in informed
everyone with cheerful vigor that the Campbells were coming Hurrah
Hurrah

Captain Shadrach Gould arose from that chair arose promptly and without
hesitation Mr Zoeth Hamilton also rose so did many others in the
vicinity There was a stir and a rustle and whispered exclamations
And still the news of the imminent arrival of the Campbells was tinkled
abroad and continued to tinkle Someone giggled so did someone else
Others said Hush

Mrs Judge Baxter said Heavens and earth

Mrs Hobbs looked as if she wished to say something very much indeed

Captain Shadrachs bald spot blazed a fiery red and he glared about him
helplessly

Mr Hallett who was used to unexpected happenings at funeralsthough
to do him justice he had never before had to deal with anything quite
like thisrushed to the center of the disturbance Mrs Hobbs
hastened to help Together and with whisperings they fidgeted with
the refractory catch And still the music box playedand playedand
played

At last Mr Hallett gave it up He seized the chair and with it in his
arms rushed out into the diningroom Captain Shadrach Gould mopped his
face with a handkerchief and stood because there was nowhere for him
to sit Mrs Hobbs almost as red in the face as Captain Shad himself
hastened back and collapsed upon the sofa Mr Sharon cleared his
throat

And still from behind the closed door of the diningroom the music
chair tinkled on

The Campbells are coming Hurrah Hurrah Poor little guilty
frightened MaryGusta covered her face with her hands




CHAPTER II


And now gentlemen said Judge Baxter here we are Sit down and make
yourselves comfortable I shall have a good deal to say and I expect to
surprise you Sit down

Captain Gould and Mr Hamilton were in the Judges library at his home
The funeral was over all that was mortal of Marcellus Hall had been
laid to rest in the Ostable cemetery and his two friends and former
partners had on their return from that cemetery stopped at the
Judges at the latters request He wished so he said to speak with
them on an important matter

Why dont you sit down Captain asked the Judge noticing that
although Zoeth had seated himself in the rocker which his host had
indicated Shadrach was still standing

Captain Shadrach laid a hand on the back of the armchair and regarded
the lawyer with a very grave face but with a twinkle in his eye

To tell you the truth Judge he said slowly I dont callate I
ever shall set down again quite so wholehearted as I used to You spoke
of a surprise didnt you Ive had one surprise this afternoon thats
liable to stay with me for a spell Im an unsuspectin critter
generally speakin but after thatSay you aint got a brass band nor
fireworks hitched to THIS chair have you

Judge Baxter laughed heartily No he said as soon as he could speak
No Captain my furniture isnt loaded

The Captain shook his head Whew he whistled sitting down gingerly
in the armchair Well thats a mercy I aint so young as I used to be
and I couldnt stand many such shocks Whew Dont talk to ME When that
devilish jig tune started up underneath me Ill bet I hopped up three
foot straight I may be kind of slow sittin down but youll bear me
out that I can GET UP sudden when its necessary And I thought the dum
thing never would STOP

Mr Hamilton stirred uneasily Hush hush Shadrach he pleaded
Dont be so profane Remember youve just come from the graveyard

Come from it By fire There was a time there when Id have been
willin to go to ityes and stay All I wanted was to get out of that
room and hide somewheres where folks couldnt look at me I give you my
word I could feel myself heatin up like an airtight stove Good thing I
didnt have on a celluloid collar or twould have bust into a blaze Of
all the dummed outrages to spring on a man that

Shadrach

There there Zoeth Ill calm down But as for swearinwell if
you knew how full of cusswords I was there one spell you wouldnt
find fault youd thank me for holdin em in I had to batten down my
hatches to do it though I tell you that

Mr Hamilton turned to their host Youll excuse Shadrach wont you
Judge he said apologetically He dont mean nothin wicked really
And he feels as bad as I do about Marcelluss bein took

Course I do put in the Captain Zoeths always scared to death for
fear Im bound to the everlastin brimstone He forgets Ive been to sea
a good part of my life and that a feller has to talk strong aboard ship
Common language may do for keepin store but it dont get a vessel
nowheres the salt sort of takes the tang out of it seems so Im
through for the present Zoeth Ill keep the rest till I meet the swab
that loaded up that chair for me

The Judge laughed again Then he opened his desk and took from a drawer
two folded papers

Gentlemen he said gravely I asked you to come here with me because
there is an important matter a very important matter which I as
Captain Halls legal adviser must discuss with you

Captain Shadrach and Zoeth looked at each other The former tugged at
his beard

Hum he mused Somethin to do with Marcelluss affairs is it

Yes

Want to know And somethin to do with me and Zoeth

Yes with both of you This holding up one of the folded papers is
Captain Halls will I drew it for him a year ago and he has appointed
me his executor

Zoeth nodded We supposed likely he would he observed

Couldnt get a better man added Shadrach with emphasis

Thank you Captain Hall leaves all he possessedpractically all there
is a matter of two hundred dollars for his housekeeper Mrs Hobbs and
a few other personal giftsbut he leaves practically all he possessed
to his stepdaughter Mary Lathrop

Both his hearers nodded again We expected that naturally said the
Captain Its what hed ought to have done of course Well shell be
pretty well fixed wont she

Judge Baxter shook his head Why noshe wont he said soberly
That is a part of the surprise which I mentioned at first Captain Hall
was practically a poor man when he died

That the prophesied surprise was now a reality was manifest Both men
looked aghast

Youyou dont mean that Judge gasped Zoeth

Poor Marcellus poor cried Shadrach Whywhy what kind of talks
that He didnt have no more than the rest of us when he hesitated
glanced at Zoeth and continued when the firm give up business back in
79 but he went to sea again and made considerable and then he made a
whole lot in stocks I know he did You know it too Zoeth How could
he be poor

Because like so many other fortunate speculators he continued to
speculate and became unfortunate He lost the bulk of his winnings in
the stock market andwell to be quite frank Captain Hall has been a
broken man mentally as well as physically since his wifes death and
his own serious illness You yourselves must have noticed the change
in his habits From being an active man a man of affairs he became
almost a hermit He saw but few people dropped the society of all his
old friends and lived alonealone except for his various housekeepers
and MaryGustathe little girl I mean You must have noticed the
change in his relations with you

Mr Hamilton sighed Yes he said we noticed he never came to see us
andand

And wasnt overn above sociable when we come to see him finished
Captain Shadrach Yes we noticed that But I say Judge he must have
had SOME money left What became of it

Goodness knows He was a child so far as money matters went in his
later years Very likely he frittered it away in more stock ventures I
know he bought a lot of good for nothing mining shares At any rate it
has gone all except a few thousands The house and land where he lived
is mortgaged up to the handle and I imagine there are debts a good
many of them But whatever there is is left to MaryGustaeveryone
calls her that and I seem to have caught the habit It is left to
herin trust

Captain Shadrach thought this over In trust with you I presume
likely he observed Well as I said afore he couldnt have found a
better man

HE thought he could two better men I rather think he was right You
are the two gentlemen

This statement did not have the effect which the Judge expected He
expected exclamations and protests Instead his visitors looked at each
other and at him in a puzzled fashion

Ererwhat was that queried Mr Hamilton I didnt exactly seem to
catch that somehow or nother

Judge Baxter turned to the Captain

You understood me didnt you Captain Gould he asked

Shadrach shook his head

Whywhy no he stammered it didnt seem to soak in somehow
Callate my head must have stopped goin maybe the shock I had a spell
ago broke the mainspring All I seem to be real sartin of just now is
that the Campbells are comin What was it you said

I said that Captain Marcellus Hall has left whatever property he owned
after his creditors are satisfied to his stepdaughter He has left it
in trust until she becomes of age And he asks you two to accept that
trust and the care of the child Is that plain

It was plain and they understood But with understanding came
apparently a species of paralysis of the vocal organs Zoeth turned
pale and leaned back in his chair Shadrachs mouth opened and closed
several times but he said nothing

Of course went on Baxter before I say any more I think you should
be told this It was Captain Halls wish that you jointly accept the
guardianship of MaryGustaof the girlthat she live with you and
that you use whatever money comes to her from her stepfathers estate
in educating and clothing her Also of course that a certain sum each
week be paid you from that estate as her board That was Marcelluss
wish but it is a wish nothing more It is not binding upon you in any
way You have a perfect right to decline and

Captain Shadrach interrupted

Heave to he ordered breathlessly Come up into the wind a minute
for mercy sakes Do you mean to say that me and Zoeth are asked to
take that youngone home with us and take care of her and dress her
andand eat her and bring her up andand

He paused incoherent in his excitement The Judge nodded

Yes he replied that is what he asks you to do But as I say you
are not obliged to do it there is no legal obligation You can say no
if you think it best

If we thinkfor thunder sakes Baxter what was the matter with
Marcellus Was he out of his head Was he loony

No he was perfectly sane

Thenthen whatZoeth turning wildly to Mr Hamilton who still
sat pale and speechless in his chair Zoeth he demanded did you
ever hear such craziness in your life Did you ever HEAR such stuff

Zoeth merely shook his head His silence appeared to add to his friends
excitement

Did you he roared

Zoeth muttered something to the effect that he didnt know as he ever
did

You dont know Yes you do know too Speak up why dont you Dont
sit there like a ships figgerhead starin at nothin You know its
craziness as wells I do For God sakes say somethin TALK

Mr Hamilton talkedto this extent

Hush Shadrach he faltered Dont be profane

Profane Puppupprofane You set there andandOh jumpin creepin
Judas II Languageeven his languagefailed to express his
feelings and he waved his fists and sputtered Baxter seized the
opportunity

Before you make your decision gentlemen he said I hope you will
consider the situation carefully The girl is only seven years old she
has no relations anywhere so far as we know If you decline the trust
a guardian will have to be appointed by the courts I suppose Who that
guardian will be or what will become of the poor child Im sure I dont
know And Captain Marcellus was perfectly sane he knew what he was
doing

Shadrach interrupted

He did he shouted Well then I must say

Just a minute please I have a letter here which he wrote at the time
he made his will It is addressed to both of you Here it is Shall I
read it to you or had you rather read it yourselves

Zoeth answered I guess maybe youd better read it Judge he said I
dont callate Shadrach nor me are capable of readin much of anything
just this minute You read it Shadrach you be still now and listen

The Captain opened his mouth and raised a hand Be still Shadrach
repeated Zoeth The hand fell Captain Gould sighed

All right Zoeth he said Ill keep my batch closed longs I can
Heave ahead Judge

The letter was a long one covering several sheets of foolscap It
began


To Shadrach Gould and Zoeth Hamilton my old partners and friends


DEAR SHAD AND ZOETH

I am writing this to you because I have known you pretty much all my
life and you are the only real friends I have got in this world


I was his friend or I tried to be commented Baxter interrupting
his reading but he considered you two and always spoke of you as his
oldest and nearest friends He has often told me that he knew he could
depend on you Now listen

The letter went on to state that the writer realized his health was
no longer good that he was likely to die at any time and was quite
reconciled


I should be glad to go Captain Hall had written if it was not for one
thing Since my wife was took from me I care precious little for life
and the sooner it ends the better That is the way I look at it But I
have a stepdaughter Mary Augusta Lathrop and for her sake I must stick
to the ship as long as I can I have not been the right kind of father
to her I have tried but I dont seem to know how and I guess likely
I was too old to learn When I go she wont have a relation to look out
for her That has troubled me a lot and I have thought about it more
than a little I can tell you And so I have decided to leave her in
your care I am hoping you will take charge of her and bring her up to
be a good girl and a good woman same as her mother was before her I
know you two will be just the ones for the job


Jumpin fire broke in Shadrach the irrepressible

Hush Shadrach continued Mr Hamilton Go on Judge

Baxter continued his reading The letter told of the will of the
property whatever it might be left in trust for the child and of the
writers desire that it might be used when turned into money for her
education There were two pages of rambling references to stocks
and investments the very vagueness of these references proving the
weakening shrewdness and lack of business acumen of Captain Hall in his
later years Then came this


When this first comes to you I know you will both feel you are not
fitted to take charge of my girl You will say that neither of you has
had any children of his own and you have not got experience in that
line But I have thought it over and I know I am right I couldnt find
better pilots afloat or ashore Shadrach has been to sea and commanded
vessels and is used to giving orders and having them carried out He
sailed mate with me for a good many voyages and was my partner ashore I
know him from truck to keelson He is honest and able and can handle
any craft He will keep the girl on the course she ought to sail in
her schooling and such and see she does not get on the rocks or take to
cruising in bad company Zoeth has had the land training He is a pious
man and as good outside the church as he is in which is not always the
case according to my experience He has the name all up and down the
Cape of being a square honest storekeeper He will look out for Marys
religious bringing up and learn her how to keep straight and think
square You are both of you different from each other in most ways but
you are each of you honest and straight in his own way I dont leave
Mary in the care of one but in the charge of both I know I am right


He said that very thing to me a good many times put in the Judge
He seemed to feel that the very fact of your being men of different
training and habits of thought made the combination ideal Between
you so he seemed to think the girl could not help but grow up as she
should I am almost through there is a little more


I want you fellows to do this for my sake I know you will after you
have thought it over You and I have been through good times and bad
together We have made money and we have seen it go faster than it came
Shad has seen his savings taken away from him partly because I trusted
where he did not and he never spoke a word of complaint nor found a
mite of fault Zoeth has borne my greatest trouble with me and though
his share was far away bigger than mine he kept me from breaking under
it I have not seen as much of you lately as I used to see but that
was my fault Not my fault exactly maybe but my misfortune I have not
been the man I was and seeing you made me realize it That is why I have
not been to South Harniss and why I acted so queer when you came here I
was sort of ashamed I guess You remember when the old Hall and Company
firm started business there were four of us who agreed to stick by each
other through foul weather and fair till we died One of that four broke
his promise and pretty nigh wrecked us all as he did wreck the firm
Now I am asking you two to stick by me and mine I am trusting and
believing that you are going to do it as I write this When you read it
I shant be on hand But if I am where I can see and hear I shall still
be believing you will do this last favor for your old messmate

MARCELLUS


Judge Baxter folded the sheets of foolscap and laid them on the table
Then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief

Well gentlemen he said after a moment

Captain Gould drew a long breath

I dont think its well he observed I think its about as sick as
it can be and I callate Zoeth feels the same eh Zoeth

Mr Hamilton did not answer He neither spoke nor moved

Of course said the lawyer it is not necessary that you make up
your minds this instant You will probably wish a few days to think the
matter over in and then you can let me know what you decide You have
heard the letter and I have explained the situation Are there any
questions you would like to ask

Shadrach shook his head

No not fars Im concerned he said My mind is made up now I did
think there wasnt anything I wouldnt do for Marcellus And I would
have done anything in reason But this aint reasonits what I
called it in the beginnin craziness Me and Zoeth cant go crazy for
anybody

Then you decline

Yes sir Im mighty sorry but of course we cant do such a thing Me
and Zoeth one of us a bach all his life and tother one aa widower
for twenty years for us to take a child to bring up My soul and body
Havin hung on to the heft of our senses so far course we decline We
cant do nothin else

And you Mr Hamilton

Zoeth appeared to hesitate Then he asked

What sort of a girl is she

MaryGusta Shes a bright child and a wellbehaved one generally
speaking Rather old for her years and a littlewell peculiar That
isnt strange considering the life she has led since her mothers
death But she is a good girl and a pretty little thing I like her so
does my wife

That was her at the cemetery wasnt it She was with that Hobbs
woman

Yes

I thought so Shadrach and I met her when we was over here two years
ago I thought the one at the graveyard was her Poor little critter
Where is she now at the houseat Marcelluss

Yes that is I suppose she is

Do youdo you callate we could see her if we went there now

Yes I am sure you could

Zoeth rose

Come on Shadrach he said lets go

The Captain stared at him

Go he repeated Where Home do you mean

No not yet I mean over to Marcelluss to see that little girl

Zoeth Hamilton Do you mean to tell meWhat do you want to see her
for Do you want to make it harder for her and for us and for all hands
What good is seein her goin to do Aint it twice as easy to say no
now and be done with it

I suppose likely twould be but it wouldnt be right Marcellus asked
us to do this thing for him and

Jumpin Judas ASKED us Do you mean to say youre thinkin of doin
what he asked Are you loony too Are you

Shh Shadrach He asked us as a last favor to take charge of his
girl I feel as you do that we cant do it taint sensible nor
possible for us to do it but

There aint any buts

But the very least we can do is go and see her and talk to her

What for So well feel meaner and more sneaky when we HAVE to say no
I shant go to see her

All right Then I shall You can wait here for me till I come back

Hold on Zoeth Hold on Dont

But Mr Hamilton was at the door and did not turn back Judge Baxter
who was following him spoke

Sit right here Captain he said Make yourself as comfortable as you
can We shant be long

For an instant Shadrach remained where he was Then he too sprang to
his feet He overtook the lawyer just as the latter reached the side
door

Hello Captain exclaimed Baxter changed your mind

Changed nothin Zoeths makin a fool of himself and I know it but he
aint goin to be a fool ALL by himself Ive seen him try it afore and
taint safe

What do you mean

The Captain grunted scornfully

I mean theres safety in numbers whether its the number of fools or
anything else he said One idiots a risky proposition but two
or three in a bunch can watch each other Come on Judge and be the
third




CHAPTER III


The white house on Phinneys Hill looked desolate and mournful when
the buggy containing Judge Baxter and his two companions drove into the
yard The wagon belonging to Mr Hallett the undertaker was at the
front door and Hallett and his assistant were loading in the folding
chairs Mr Hallett was whistling a popular melody but somehow or
other the music only emphasized the lonesomeness There is little cheer
in an undertakers whistle

Captain Gould acting under the Judges orders piloted his horse up the
driveway and into the back yard The animal was made fast to the back
fence and the three men alighted from the buggy and walked up to the
side door of the house

Say Judge whispered the Captain as they halted by the step you
dont callate I can find out who loaded up that musicbox chair on me
do you If I could meet that feller for two or three minutes I might
feel more reconciled at bein fool enough to come over here

Mrs Hobbs answered the knock at the doorshe invited them in When
told that they had come to see MaryGusta she sniffed

Shes in her room she said rather sharply She hadnt ought to be
let out but of course if you want to see her Judge Baxter I presume
likely shell have to be Ill go fetch her

Wait a minute Mrs Hobbs said Baxter Whats the matter Has the
child been behaving badly

Mrs Hobbs lean fingers clinched Behavin badly she repeated I
should say she had I never was so mortified in my life And at her own
fathers funeral too

What has she done

Done She Mrs Hobbs hesitated glanced at Captain Shadrach and
left her sentence unfinished Never mind what she done she went on
I cant tell you now I declare Id be ashamed to Ill go get her

She marched from the room Zoeth rubbed his forehead

She seems sort of put out dont she he observed mildly

Baxter nodded Susan Hobbs has the reputation of getting put out
pretty often he said She has a temper and it isnt a long one

Has she been takin care of Marcelluss girl asked Zoeth

Yes As much care as the child has had

Captain Shad snorted It was evident that the housekeepers manner had
not impressed him favorably

Humph he said Id hate to have her take care of me judgin by the
way she looked just now Say hopefully do you suppose SHE was the
one fixed that chair

They heard Mrs Hobbs on the floor above shouting

MaryGusta MaryGusta Where are you Answer me this minute

Dont seem to be in that room she was talkin about grumbled
Shadrach Tut Tut What a voice that is Got a rasp to it like a rusty
saw

Mrs Hobbs was heard descending the stairs Her face when she reentered
the sittingroom was red and she looked more put out than ever

She aint there she answered angrily Shes gone

Gone repeated Zoeth and Shadrach in chorus

Gone repeated the Judge Do you mean shes run away

No no She aint run awaynot for good she knows better than that
Shes sneaked off and hid I suppose But I know where she is Ill have
her here in a minute

She was hurrying out again but the Captain detained her

Wait he commanded Whats that you say You know where she is

Yes or I can guess Nine chances to one shes out in that barn

In the barn Whats she doin thereplayin horse

No no Shes hidin in the carriage room Seems as if the child was
possessed to get out in that dusty place and perch herself in the old
carryall She calls it her playhouse and youd think twas Heaven the
way she loves to stay there But today of all days And with her best
clothes on And after I expressly told her

Yes yes all right Humph Well Zoeth what do you say Shall we
go to Heaven and hunt for her Maybe twill be the only chance some of
usll get you cant tell with a wink at Baxter

Hush Shadrach How you do talk protested the shocked Mr Hamilton

Lets go out to the barn and find the youngone ourselves said the
Captain Seems the simplest thing to do dont it

Mrs Hobbs interrupted

You dont need to go at all she declared Ill get her and bring her
here Perhaps she aint there anyway

Well if she aint there we can come back again Come on boys

He led the way to the door The housekeeper would have accompanied them
but he prevented her doing so

Dont you trouble yourself maam he said Well find her Im
oldern I used to be but I aint so blind but what I can locate a barn
without a spyglass

It wont be any trouble protested the lady

I know but it might be Well go alone

When the three were in the back yard and the discomfited housekeeper
was watching them from the door he added

I dont know why that woman rubs my fur the wrong way but she does
Isaiah Chase says he dont like mosquitoes cause they get on his
nerves I never thought I wore my nerves on the back of my neck which
is where Isaiah gets skeeterbit mostly but anyhow wherever they be
that Hobbs woman bothers em Theres the barn aint it Dont look
very heavenly but it may seem that way after a spell in tother place
Now wheres the carriage room

The door of the carriage room was open and they entered A buggy and
the muslin draped surrey were there but no living creature was in
sight They listened but heard nothing

Mary MaryGusta called Baxter Are you here

No answer And then from beneath the cover of the surrey appeared
a fat tortoiseshell cat who jumped lightly to the floor yawned
stretched and blinked suspiciously at the visitors

Humph grunted Captain Shadrach Theres one stowaway anyhow Maybe
theres another Ive had em come aboard in pairs

The Judge walked over to the surrey and raised the cover From behind
it came a frightened little squeal

Oh there you are said Baxter MaryGusta is that you

There was a rustle a sob and then a timid voice said chokingly Yes
sir

Come out said the Judge kindly Come out here are some friends who
want to meet you

Another sob and then II dont want to

Oh yes you do We wont hurt you We only want to see you and talk
with you thats all Come thats a good girl

II aint a good girl

Never mind We want to see you anyway I guess youre not very bad

Yes II am Isis Mrs Hobbs there

No Come now please

A moments wait then from beneath the cover appeared a small foot
and leg the latter covered by a black stocking The foot wiggled
about feeling for the step It found it the cover was thrown aside and
MaryGusta appeared a pathetic little figure with rumpled hair and
tearstained cheeks Rose and Rosette the two dolls were hugged in her
arms

Judge Baxter patted her on the head Zoeth and Shadrach looked solemn
and ill at ease MaryGusta looked at the floor and sniffed dolefully

MaryGusta said the Judge these two gentlemen are old friends of
your fathers and with a pardonable stretching of the truth they
have come all the way from South Harniss to meet you Now you must shake
hands with them They like little girls

MaryGusta obediently moved forward shifted Rosette to the arm
clasping Rose and extended a hand Slowly she raised her eyes saw Mr
Hamiltons mild gentle face and then beside it the face of Captain
Shadrach Gould With a cry she dropped both dolls ran back to the
surrey and fumbled frantically with the dust cover

Baxter surprised and puzzled ran after her and prevented her climbing
into the carriage

Why MaryGusta he demanded what is the matter

The child struggled and then bursting into a storm of sobs hid her
face in the dust cover

II didnt mean to she sobbed wildly I didnt mean to Honest
I didnt II didnt know I didnt mean to Please dont let him
PLEASE

The Judge held her close and did his best to calm her

There there child he said No ones going to hurt you

Yesyes they are Mrs Hobbs said she shouldnt wonder if he knocked
mymy head right off

Knocked your head off Who

Him

She raised her hand and pointed a shaking finger straight at Captain
Shadrach

All three of her hearers were surprised of course but in the case of
the Captain himself amazement was coupled with righteous indignation

Whawhat he stammered Who said so What kind of talks that Said I
was goin to knock your head off I was

Baxter laughed No no MaryGusta he said youre mistaken Mrs
Hobbs couldnt have said any such thing Youre mistaken dear

No I aint with another sob she did say so She said he would
knock my headahahoff andand put me in jail too And I didnt
mean to do it honest truly I didnt

The Judge looked at his companions and shook his head as if the
conundrum was beyond his guessing Captain Shad groaned

By fire he ejaculated All hands have gone loony youngones and
all And with conviction Im on the road myself

Zoeth Hamilton stepped forward and held out his hands

Come here dearie he said gently come here and tell me all about
it Neither me nor the Capns goin to hurt you a mite We like little
girls both of us do Now you come and tell me about it

MaryGustas sobs ceased She looked at the speaker doubtfully

Come dont be scared begged Zoeth Were goin to be good friends
to you We knew your father and he thought everything of us You aint
goin to be afraid of folks that was your Pas chums You come here and
lets talk it over

Slowly MaryGusta crossed the room Zoeth sat down upon an empty box
near the door and lifted the girl to his knee

Now you aint afraid of me be you he asked quietly

MaryGusta shook her head but her big eyes were fixed upon Captain
Shadrachs face

Noo she faltered II guess I aint But you wasnt the one I did
it to It was him

Judging by the Captains expression his conviction that all hands
himself included had lost their reason was momentarily growing firmer

ME he gasped You done somethin to me and Iwell by Judas this
is

Hush Shadrach What was it you done Mary that made you afraid of
Capn Gould Tell me I wont hurt you and I wont let anybody else

YOU wont letZoeth Hamilton I swan I

Be still Shadrach for mercy sakes Now what was it dearie

MaryGusta hesitated Then she buried her face in Mr Hamiltons jacket
and sobbed a confession

II made it go she cried II broke thethe catchand it was
wound up andand it went off But I didnt know I didnt mean

There there course you didnt We know you didnt What was it that
went off

Thethe music chair It was in the corner and Mr Hallett took it
andand I couldnt say anything cause Mrs Hobbs said I mustnt speak
a word at the funeral Andand he set in it and it played andOh
dont let him put me in jail Please dont

Another burst of tears MaryGusta clung tightly to the Hamilton
jacket Judge Baxter looked as if a light had suddenly broken upon the
darkness of his mind

I see he said You were responsible for the Campbells I see

Shadrach drew a long breath

Whew he whistled So she was the one Well I swan

Zoeth stroked the childs hair

Thats all right dearie he said Now dont you worry about that
We didnt know who did it but now we do and its all right We know you
didnt mean to

Wontwont he knock my head off

No no course he wont Tell her so Shadrach

Captain Shadrach pulled at his beard Then he burst into a laugh

I wont hurt you for nothin sis he said heartily Its all right
and dont you fret about it Accidents will happen even in the best
regulatederfunerals though with a broad grin I hope another one
like thatll never happen to ME Now dont you cry any more

MaryGusta raised her head and regarded him steadily

Wont I be put in jail she asked more hopefully

Indeed you wont I never put anybody in jail in my life though with
an emphatic nod theres some folks ought to go there for frightenin
children out of their senses Did that Mrs Hobbs tell you I was goin
towhat was itknock your head off and all the rest

Yes sir she did

Well shes ashes what she is What else did she say to you

Sheshe said I was a bad wicked child and she hoped Id be sent to
thethe orphans home If she was to have the care of me she said
shed make me walk a chalk or know why And she sent me to my room and
said I couldnt have any supper

Zoeth and the Captain looked at each other Baxter frowned

On the very day of her fathers funeral he muttered

Cant I have any supper begged MaryGusta Im awful hungry I
didnt want much dinner

Zoeth nodded His tone when he spoke was not so mild as was usual with
him

You shall have your supper he said

Andand must I go to the orphans home

No one answered at once Zoeth and Captain Shad again looked at each
other and the Judge looked at them both

Must I repeated MaryGusta II dont want to Id rather die I
guess and go to Heaven same as Mother and Father But Mrs Hobbs says
they dont have any dolls nor cats in Heaven so I dont knows Id want
to go there

Baxter walked to the window and looked out Captain Shadrach reached
into his pocket produced a crumpled handkerchief and blew his nose
violently Zoeth stroked the childs hair

MaryGusta he said after a moment how would you like to go over
to South Harniss andand see me and Capn Gould a little while Just
make us a visit you know Think youd like that

The Captain started Good land Zoeth he exclaimed Be careful what
youre sayin

I aint sayin anything definite Shadrach I know how you feel about
it I just wanted to see how she felt herself thats all Think youd
like that MaryGusta

MaryGusta thought it over I guess maybe I would she said if
I could take my dolls and David I wouldnt want to leave David Mrs
Hobbs dont like cats

And at that moment Mrs Hobbs herself appeared in the doorway of the
carriage room She saw the child and her eyes snapped

So she was here she said I thought as much MaryGusta what did
you run away from that room for Didnt I forbid you leavin it Shes
been a bad girl Judge Baxter she added and I cant make her behave
I try my best but Im sure I dont know what to do

Captain Shadrach thrust both hands into his pockets

I tell you what to do he said sharply You go into the house and
put some of her things into a valise or satchel or somethin And hurry
up as fast as you can

Mrs Hobbs was astonished

Put em in a satchel she repeated What for Wheres she goin

Shes goin home along with me and Zoeth And shes got to start inside
of half an hour You hurry

Butbut

There aint any buts havent got time for em

Mr Hamilton regarded his friend with an odd expression

Shadrach he asked do you realize what youre sayin

Whos sayin You said it I didnt Besides takin her home with us
today dont mean nothin does it A visit wont hurt us Visits dont
bind anybody to anything Jumpin Judas I guess weve got room enough
in the house to have one youngone come visitin forfor a couple of
days if we want to What are you makin such a fuss about Here
you turning to the housekeeper aint you gone yet Youve got just
thirteen minutes to get that satchel ready

Mrs Hobbs departed outraged dignity in her walk and manner

Amam I goin faltered MaryGusta

Zoeth nodded

Yes he said youre goin Unless of course youd rather stay
here

No Id rather go ifif I can take David and the dolls Can I

Can she Shadrach

Captain Shad who was pacing the floor turned savagely

What do you ask me that for he demanded This is your doins
taint mine You said it first didnt you Yes yes let her take the
dolls and catsand cows and pigs too if she wants to Jumpin fire
What do I care If a fellers bound to be a fool a little live stock
more or less dont make him any bigger one    Land sakes I believe
shes goin to cry again Dont do that Whats the matter now

The tears were starting once more in the girls eyes

II dont think you want me she stammered If you did youyou
wouldnt talk so

The Captain was greatly taken aback He hesitated tugged at his beard
and then walking over to the child took her by the hand

Dont you mind the way I talk MaryGusta he said Im liable to
talk most any way but I dont mean nothin by it I like little girls
same as Zoeth said And I aint mad about the jigtune chair neither
Say with a sudden inspiration here we are settin here and one of
our passengers has left the dock We got to find that cat aint we
What did you say his name wasSolomon

No sir David

David sure enough If Id been up in Scripture the way ZoethMr
Hamilton hereis I wouldnt have made that mistake would I Come on
lets you and me go find David and break the news to him Say hell be
some surprised to find hes booked for a foreign vyage wont he Come
on well go find him

MaryGusta slowly rose from Mr Hamiltons knee She regarded the
Captain steadily for a moment then hand in hand they left the barn
together

Judge Baxter whistled Well he exclaimed I must say I didnt expect
this

Zoeth smiled There aint many better men than Shadrach Gould he
observed quietly




CHAPTER IV


MaryGusta even though she lives to be a very old woman will never
forget that ride to South Harniss It was the longest ride she had ever
taken and that of itself would have made it unforgettable Then too
she was going visiting and she had never been visiting before Also
she was leaving Mrs Hobbs and for a time at least that lady could not
remind her of her queerness and badness More than all she was going on
a journey a real journey like a grownup or a person in a story and
her familyDavid and the dollswere journeying with her What the
journey might mean to her or to what sort of place she was goingthese
questions did not trouble her in the least Childlike she was quite
satisfied with the wonderful present and to the future even the
dreaded orphans home she gave not a thought

Perched on the buggy seat squeezed in between Captain Shad and Mr
Hamilton she gazed wideeyed at the houses and fields and woods along
the roadside She did not speak unless spoken to and the two men spoke
but seldom each apparently thinking hard Occasionally the Captain
would sigh or whistle or groan as if his thoughts were disturbing and
most unusual Once he asked her if she was comfortable

Yes sir she said

Havin a good time Like to go to ride do you

MaryGusta assumed her most grownup air

Yes sir she said I just love to travel Its been the dream of my
life

Gosh I want to know exclaimed the astonished Shadrach then he shook
his head chuckled and ordered the horse to hurry up

The dolls were arranged in a row against the back of the dashboard In
front of them and between the Captains feet and Zoeths the battered
satchel containing the childs everyday dress and visiting essentials
was squeezed MaryGustas feet stuck straight out and rested on the
top of the satchel David in a basket with the lid tied fast was
planted between the last mentioned feet David did not appear to share
hisor herowners love of travel The cat wailed lugubriously at
intervals

Zoeth made the next attempt at conversation

Never been to South Harniss have you MaryGusta he inquired

No sir gravely But remembering the housekeepers final charge
not to forget her manners if she had any Im sure Ill like it very
much

Oh you are eh Well thats nice What makes you so sure

MaryGusta reflected She remembered what Mrs Bailey had said after a
weeks visit in Bayport which is fourteen miles from Ostable I think
everybody enjoys a change of air she observed

My soul and body exclaimed Mr Hamilton

Captain Shad looked down at his small passenger

How old are you sis he demanded

Im seven But I aint a sis I havent got any brothers or sisters

Oh Well thats a fact too now I come to think of it How old did
you say seventy was it

No sir Seven Did you think I said seventy

Eh No I guess not

I couldnt be seventy If I was Id be lots bigger you know

Thats so I presume likely you would

More reflection Then If I was seventy I guess you wouldnt have asked
me

Sho Wouldnt I Why not

Cause grownup folks dont like to be asked how old they are I asked
Mrs Hobbs how old she was once and she didnt like it

Didnt she

No sir She told me to mind my own business

The Captain laughed aloud Then turning to Mr Hamilton he said Say
Zoeth Isaiahll be a little mite surprised when he sees this craft make
port eh

Zoeth smiled I shouldnt wonder he replied

Umhm Id like to have a tintype of Isaiahs face Well siser
MaryGusta I meantheres South Harniss dead ahead How do you like
the looks of it

They had emerged from a long stretch of woods and were at the summit of
a little hill From the crest of this hill the road wound down past an
old cemetery with gray mosscovered slate tombstones over a bridge
between a creek and a goodsized pond on through a clump of pines
where it joined the main highway along the south shore of the Cape This
highway in turn wound and twistedthere are few straight roads
on Cape Codbetween other and lower hills until it became a village
street the main street of South Harniss The sun was low in the west
and its light bathed the clustered roofs in a warm glow touched
windows and vanes with fire and twinkled and glittered on the waters
of Nantucket Sound which filled the whole southern horizon There was
little breeze and the smoke from the chimneys rose almost straight So
too did the smoke from the distant tugs and steamers There were two or
three schooners far out and nearer shore a sailboat A pretty picture
one which artists have painted and summer visitors enthused over many
times

To MaryGusta it was new and wonderful The child was in a mood to like
almost anything just then Mrs Hobbs was miles away and the memory of
the music chair and her own disgrace and shame were but memories She
drew a long breath and looked and looked

Like it do you asked Zoeth echoing his friends question

MaryGusta nodded Yes sir she said Itits lovely

Captain Shadrach nodded Best town on earth if I do say it he said
emphatically So you think its lovely eh

Yes sir Then pointing she asked Is that your house

The Captain grinned Well no not exactly he said Thats the town
hall Nobody lives there but the selectmen and they aint permanent
boardersthat is I have hopes some of em ll move after townmeetin
day Our house is over yonder down nigh the shore

The old horse pricked up his ears at sight of home and the buggy moved
faster It rolled through the main street where the Captain and
Mr Hamilton were kept busy answering hails and returning bows from
citizens male and female Through the more thickly settled portion of
the village it moved until at a point where there were fewer shops and
the houses were older and less uptodate it reached the corner of a
narrow cross road There it stopped before a frame building bearing the
sign Hamilton and Company Dry Goods Groceries Boots and Shoes and
Notions There was a narrow platform at the front of the building and
upon this platform were several men mostly of middle age or older
MaryGusta noticed that most of these men were smoking If she had been
older she might have noticed that each man either sat upon the platform
steps or leaned against the posts supporting its roof Not one was
depending solely upon his own muscles for support he sat upon or leaned
against something wooden and substantial

As the buggy drew alongside the platform the men evinced considerable
interest Not enough to make them rise or relinquish support but
interest nevertheless

Hello Shad hailed one Home again be you

Pretty big funeral was it drawled another

Whos that you got aboard queried a third

Captain Shadrach did not answer Mr Hamilton leaned forward Wheres
Annabel he asked

Shes inside replied the first questioner Want to see her Hi
Jabe turning his head and addressing one of the group nearest the
door tell Annabel Zoeth and Shads come

Jabe who was propped against a post languidly pushed himself away
from it opened the door behind him and shouted Annabel come out
here Then he slouched back and leaned against the post again

The door opened and a stout redfaced young woman appeared She looked
much more like an Eliza than an Annabel She had a newspaper in her
hand

Hey she drawled Who was that hollerin Was it you Jabez Hedges

Jabez did not take the trouble to answer Instead he took a hand from
his trousers pocket and waved it toward the buggy Annabel looked then
she came down the steps

Hello she said I see you got back all right

Zoeth nodded Howd you get along in the store he asked anxiously
Hows business

Wasnt none to speak of replied Annabel carelessly Sold a couple of
spools of cotton andand some salt pork and sugar Ezra Howland bought
the pork He wasnt satisfied said there wasnt enough lean in it to
suit him but I let him have it a cent cheaper so he took it

Mr Hamilton seemed a trifle disappointed Was that all he asked
with a sigh

Yup No twant neither come to think of it Rastus Youngs wife
come in with her two youngones and bought some shoes and hats for em

Did she pay cash demanded Captain Shadrach sharply

No she said charge em up so I done it Say aint you comin in
pretty soon Its most my supper time

Zoeth opened his mouth to answer but the Captain got ahead of him

Its our supper time too he said crisply When weve had it you
can have yours Get dap January

The horse whose name was Major but who was accustomed to being
addressed by almost any name jogged on Mr Hamilton sighed once more

Im fraid one of us had ought to stayed in the store Shadrach he
said Annabel means well shes real obligin but she aint a good
hand at business

Shadrach snorted Obligin nothin he retorted Were the ones that
was obligin when we agreed to pay her seventyfive cents for settin
astern of the counter and readin the Advocate I told you when you
hired her that she wasnt good for nothin but ballast

I know Shadrach Id ought to have stayed to home and kept store
myself But I did feel as if I must go to Marcelluss funeral

Sellin them Youngs a whole passel of stuff and lettin em charge it
up went on Shadrach They owe us enough now to keep a decent family
all winter Reglar town deadbeats thats what they are You couldnt
get a cent out of Rastus Young if you were to run a dredge through him

Mr Hamilton groaned remorsefully If Id only stayed at home he
said

If youd stayed to home youd have charged up the stuff just the same
as she did Youre the softest thing outside of a sponge in this town
Anybody can impose on you and you know it Zoeth

Zoeths habitual mildness gave way to resentment mild resentment

Why Shadrach he retorted how you talk You was the one that
charged up the last things Rastuss folks bought You know you was

The Captain looked as if he had been caught napping

Well whats that got to do with it he sputtered Twasnt nothin
but some corn meal and a few yards of calico How could I help chargin
it up with that woman cryin and goin on about their havin nothin
to eat nor wear in the house I couldnt let em starve could I Nor
freeze neither

Twas only last week she did it protested his partner Folks dont
freeze in April seems to me

Aw be still Dont talk no more about it By fire with a sudden
change of subject and a burst of enthusiasm look at that horse will
you Turned right in at the gate without my pullin the helm once or
sayin a wordknows as much as a Christian that horse does

The buggy had rocked and plowed its way over the hummocks and through
the sand of the narrow lane and was at the top of a grasscovered
knoll a little hill At the foot of the hill was the beach strewn
with seaweed and beyond the Sound its waters now a rosy purple in
the sunset light On the slope of the hill toward the beach stood a low
rambling white house a barn and several sheds and outbuildings There
were lilac bushes by the front door of the house a clamshell walk from
the lane to that door and surrounding the whole a whitewashed picket
fence A sandy rutted driveway led from the rear of the house and the
entrance of the barn down to a big gate now wide open It was through
this gateway and along this drive that the sagacious Major was pulling
the buggy

MaryGusta stared at the house As she stared the back door was thrown
open and a tall thin man came out He was in his shirtsleeves his arms
were bare to the elbow and to MaryGustas astonishment he wore an
apron a gingham apron similar to those worn by Mrs Hobbs when at work
in the kitchen

Ahoy there Isaiah hailed the Captain Here we are

The man with the apron took a big nickel watch from the upper pocket
of his vest looked at it and shook his head Upon his face which was
long and thin like the rest of him there was a grieved expression

A little mite late aint we Isaiah said Zoeth hastily Hope we
aint kept supper waitin too long

The tall man returned the watch to the pocket

Only twentythree minutes thats all he drawled with the
resignation of a martyr Twentythree minutes aint much in a lifetime
maybebut it dont help fried potatoes none Them potatoes was ready at
halfpast five

Well taint six yet protested Captain Shad

Maybe taint but its twentythree minutes latern halfpast five
Last thing you said to me was Have supper ready at halfpast five I
had it ready Them potatoes went on the fire at

There there interrupted the Captain Never mind the potatoes Well
tend to them in a minute Give us a hand with this dunnage Theres
a satchel here and some more stuff Sooner this crafts unloaded the
sooner we can eat All ashore thats goin ashore

Zoeth climbed out of the buggy He lifted their passenger to the ground

MaryGusta he said heres where Capn Gould and I live This is
Mr Isaiah Chase Isaiah this is Mary Lathrop Capn Marcelluss little
girl Shes come tot

To make us a little visit put in the Captain promptly You want to
get acquainted with Isaiah MaryGusta hes cook and steward for me
and Mr Zoeth Thats right shake hands and be sociable

MaryGusta extended her hand and Mr Chase after wiping his own hand
on the apron pumped hers up and down

Pleased to meet you he said solemnly

Now for the dunnage said Captain Shad Theres the satchel andand
the other things Look out for that basket LOOK OUT

Mr Chase had seized the basket and swung it out of the buggy David
frightened at the sudden aerial ascension uttered a howl Isaiah
dropped the basket as if it was red hot

What in tunket he exclaimed

Nothin but a cat explained the Captain Twont hurt you

A cat Whatwhose cat

Mine said MaryGusta running to the rescue Hes a real good cat
He aint cross hes scared thats all Honest he aint cross Are
you David

David howled and clawed at the cover of the basket Mr Chase backed
away

A cat he repeated You fetched a cathere

Sartin we fetched it Captain Shadrach was evidently losing patience
Did you think wed fetch an elephant Now get out themthem doll
babies and things

Isaiah stared at the dolls MaryGusta stopped patting the basket and
hastened to the side of the buggy Ill take the dollies she said
Theyre mine too

A moment later they entered the house MaryGusta bore three of the
dolls Mr Hamilton carried the other two and Isaiah with the valise
in one hand and the basket containing the shrieking David at arms
length in the other led the way Captain Shad after informing them
that he would be aboard in a jiffy drove on to the barn

The room they first entered was the kitchen It was small rather
untidy and smelt strongly of fish and the fried potatoes

Come right along with me MaryGusta said Zoeth Fetch the satchel
Isaiah

Hold on shouted the perturbed cook and steward Whatwhat in the
nation will I do with this critter

The critter was David who was apparently turning somersaults in the
basket

Zoeth hesitated MaryGusta settled the question

Put him right down please she said Hell be better soon as hes
put down Hes never traveled before and its kind of strange to him
Hell be all right and Ill come back and let him out pretty soon
Maynt I MrMr Chase

Huh Yes yes you can if you want to I callate I dont want to
thats sure

He deposited the basket on the floor at his feet MaryGusta looked at
it rather dubiously and for an instant seemed about to speak but
she did not and followed Mr Hamilton from the kitchen through the
adjoining room evidently the diningroom and up a narrow flight of
stairs

I callate well put her in the spare room wont we Isaiah queried
Zoeth with some hesitation

Isaiah grunted Guess so he said ungraciously Aint no other place
that I know of Bed aint made though

The spare room was of good size and smelled shut up and musty as
spare rooms in the country usually do It was furnished with a bureau
washstand and two chairs each painted in a robins egg blue with
sprays of yellow roses There were several pictures on the walls their
subjects religious and mournful The bed was as Mr Chase had said not
made in fact it looked as if it had not been made for some time

Ive been callatin to make up that bed for moren a month explained
Isaiah Last time twas unmade was when Zoeth had that minister from
Trumet here of a Saturday and Sunday Every day Ive callated to make
up that bed but I dont seem to get no time Im so everlastin busy I
dont get time for nothin somehow

I can make the bed declared MaryGusta eagerly I can make beds
real well Mrs Hobbs told me soonce

The two men looked at each other Before either could speak a
tremendous racket broke out on the floor below a sound of somethingor
somebodytumbling about a roar in a human voice and a feline screech
MaryGusta rushed for the stairs

I knew he would she said frantically I was afraid somebody would
It was RIGHT in front of the door Oh David dear Im acomin Im
acomin

From the kitchen came Captain Shadrachs voice It sounded excited and
angry

Who in blazes left that dum critter right under my feet he hollered
II swan I believe Ive broke my neckor hisone or tother

When Zoeth and Isaiah reached the kitchen they found the Captain sitting
in a chair rubbing his knees and MaryGusta seated on the floor
beside the open basket hugging the frightened and struggling David

II guess hes all right panted the child I was so afraid hed be
killed You aint killed are you David

David appeared to be remarkably sound and active He wriggled from his
owners arms and bolted under the stove

No hes all right said MaryGusta Isnt it nice he aint hurt
MrI mean Capn Gould

Captain Shad rubbed his knee Umyes he said with elaborate
sarcasm its lovely Course I dont mind breakin both MY legs but if
that cat had beenerbruised or anything I should have felt bad Well
Isaiah he added tartly turning to the grinning steward are them
fried potatoes of yours real or just in your mind

Eh Whywhy theyre right there on the stove Capn Shad

Want to know Then suppose you put em on the table Im hungry and Id
like to eat one more square meal afore somethin else happens to finish
me altogether By fire if this aint been a day First that chair and
then that will and letter of Marcelluss and then this Humph Come on
all hands lets eat supper I need somethin solid to brace me up for
tomorrows program if its up to this Ill need strength to last it
through Come on

That first supper in the white house by the shore was an experience for
MaryGusta Mrs Hobbs in spite of her faultfinding and temper had
been a competent and careful housekeeper Meals which she prepared were
well cooked and neatly served This meal was distinctly different
There was enough to eatin fact an abundancefried cod and the fried
potatoes and hot biscuits and driedapple pie but everything was put
upon the table at the same time and Mr Chase sat down with the others
and did not even trouble to take off his apron The tablecloth was not
very clean and the knives and forks and spoons did not glitter like
those the child had been accustomed to see

Even Mr Hamilton to whom most of the things of this worldhis beloved
store exceptedseemed to be unessential trivialities spoke of the
table linen

Seems to me he observed in his gentle and hesitating way this
tablecloths sort of spotted up Dont you think so Shadrach

Captain Shads reply was emphatic and to the point

Looks as if twas breakin out with chickenpox he replied Aint we
got a clean one in the locker Isaiah

Mr Chases face assumed an aggrieved expression

Course we have he answered but I didnt know you was goin to have
company

Neither did we But we could stand a clean tablecloth even at that

Ive got somethin to do besides changin tablecloths every day

Every day Every Thanksgivin Day you mean This one

Now lookahere Capn Shad you know well as I do that Sarah J
never come to do the washin last week She was down with the grip and
couldnt move If you expect me to do washin as well as cook and sweep
and keep house andand shovel snow and

Shovel snow What kind of talks that There aint been any snow since
February

Dont make no difference When there was I shoveled it didnt I It
aint no use I try and try but I cant give satisfaction and I mights
well quit I dont have to stay here and slave myself to death I can
get another job Theres folks in this town thats just dyin to have me
work for em

Captain Shadrach muttered something to the effect that if Isaiah did
work for them they might die sooner Mr Chase rose from his seat

All right he said with dignity All right this settles it Im
through After all the years I sailed cook along with you Shad Gould
and after you beggin meyes sir beggin on your knees as you might
say for me to run this house for you long as you livedafter that
totoGoodby Ill try not to lay it up against you

He was movingnot hastily but actually movingtoward the kitchen
door Zoeth who was evidently much disturbed rose and laid a hand on
his arm

There there Isaiah he pleaded Dont act so We aint findin any
fault Shadrach wasnt findin fault was you Shadrach

No no course I wasnt Dont talk so foolish Isaiah Nobody wants
you to quit All I said wasCome back here and set down Your teas
gettin all cold

To MaryGusta it seemed as if the tea had been at least cool to begin
with However Mr Chase suffered himself to be led back to the table
and attacked his supper in injured silence MaryGusta offered a
suggestion

I guess I could wash a tablecloth she said I always wash my dolls
things

Her three companions were plainly surprised The Captain was the first
to speak

You dont say he exclaimed

Yes sir I do And with a glance at the silver I can scour
knives and forks and spoons too I used to help Mrs Hobbs scour em
sometimes

Even Shadrach had no remark to make He gazed at the child then at
Zoeth and drew a long breath

As soon as supper was over the Captain and Mr Hamilton hastened up to
the village and the store

You better go to bed pretty soon MaryGusta said Zoeth Youre
tired I know Isaiahll make your bed for you Well be on hand and see
you first thing in the morning Isaiahll go up with you and blow out
your light and all Good night

The Captain said good night also and the pair hurried out

When at ten oclock they returned they found Mr Chase up and awaiting
them Isaiah had a story to tell

I never see a youngone like that in this world declared Isaiah You
know what she done after you left Helped me do the dishes Yes sir
by time thats what she done And she wiped em firstrate too good
enough to satisfy ME and you know that means somethin cause I aint
easy to satisfy And talk Say I never had a child talk same as she
does How old is she for the land sakes

Zoeth told them the visitors age

Well maybe so went on Isaiah but she dont talk seven nigher
seventeen if you ask me Pumpin me about funerals she was and about
folks dyin and so on Said she callated shed have a dolls funeral
some time For mercy sakes what for I says Cant you think up
anything pleasantern that to play That kind of game would give me the
blue creeps She thought that overshe generally thinks about a thing
for five minutes afore she talks about itand says she I know she
says but a person must go to funerals and so its better to get used
to em and know how to behave I shouldnt want my dolls she says to
do things at funerals that make people feel bad and laugh I couldnt
get that through my head If they felt bad they wouldnt laugh would
they says I THEY wouldntthe ones that felt bad wouldnt says
she but others might laugh at them And that would make the person who
was to blame feel TERRIBLY Now what was all that about Can you make
any sense of it

Captain Shadrach smiled sheepishly I callate me and Zoeth have an
idea what she was drivin at he said Go on Isaiah what else did
she say

What didnt she say Wanted to know if I thought God would knock
anybodys head off that had done wrong even if they didnt mean to
Yes sir thats what she saidif God would knock anybodys head off
Mine pretty nigh come off when she said that I told her that furs I
knew He wasnt in the habit of doin it She said that Mrs Hobbs told
her that if she wasnt punished for her wickedness in this world she
would be in the next She was real kind of scared about it seemed to
me Now whats she done thats wicked a little critter like her

Zoeth said nothing but he looked vexed and disturbed

Id knock SOMEBODYS head off if I had my way observed Shadrach Or
if I didnt Id like to Where is she now Isaiah

Shes up in the spare room asleep I callate And shes got her dolls
along with her three on one side and two on tother Wanted me to be
sure and wake all hands of em up on time in the mornin He he She
undressed them dolls every one of em afore they turned in Oh yes
and she helped me make the bed too She CAN make a bed blessed if she
cant And all the time atalkin one minute like a child and the next
like a fortyyearold woman Shes the queerest youngone

I guess shes had a kind of queer bringin up said Zoeth

Wheres thatwheres SaulerElijahwhats his nameDavid asked
the Captain Wheres the cat

Hes out in the barn locked in She had to go out along with me when
I toted him there and kiss him good night and tell him not to be
frightened and goodness knows what allyoud think she was that cats
mother to hear her How longs she goin to stay

Dont know replied Shadrach hastily That aint settled yet

Howd you come to fetch her over here Youre the last ones I
ever thought would be fetchin a child to visit you Say you aint
callatin to keep her for good are you

Zoeth hesitated Shadrachs answer was emphatic

Course not he snapped What do Zoeth and me know about managin a
child Keep her for good the idea

Isaiah chuckled Cordin to my notion he said you wouldnt have
to know much You wouldnt have to manage her If she wasnt managin
youyes and me tooinside of a month Id miss my guess Shes a
born manager You ought to see her handle them dolls and that cat

When the two partners of Hamilton and Company went upstairs to their
own bedrooms they opened the door of the spare room and peeped in
MaryGustas head and those of the dolls were in a row upon the pillow
It was a strange sight in that room and that house

I declare whispered Zoeth And this mornin we never dreamed of such
a thing How long this day has been

Judgin by the state of my nerves and knees its been two year
replied Shadrach Ive aged that much I swan to man Humph I wonder
if Marcellus knows whats happened

His tone was not loud but it or the lamplight in her face awakened
MaryGusta She stirred opened her eyes and regarded them sleepily

Is it mornin she asked

No no replied Zoeth Its only ten oclock Captain Shadrach and
I was goin to bed and we looked in to see if you was all right thats
all You must go right to sleep again dearie

Yes sir said MaryGusta obediently Then she added I said my
prayers to myself but Ill say em to you if you want me to

The embarrassed Captain would have protested but the girls mind seemed
to be made up

I guess I will say em again she said Theres somethin in em
maybe youd ought to hear She closed her eyes Please God bless
FatherOh I forgotbless Mrs Hobbs and Capn Gould and Mr Hamilton
I thought Id ask him to bless you you know because Im visitin
here And bless David and Rose and Rosette and Emma and Christobel and
Minnehaha Theyre my dolls And please God forgive me for breakin
the music chair and makin it go off because you know I am very sorry
and wont do it again Andand Oh yesbless Mr Chase Amen You
dont mind my puttin you and Mr Chase in do you

No dearie not a mite said Zoeth

Captain Shad looking more embarrassed than ever shook his head Good
night said MaryGusta Zoeth hesitated then he walked over and
kissed her

Good night little girl he said

Good night Mr Hamilton said MaryGusta Then she turned
expectantly toward the Captain Shadrach fidgeted turned to go and
then turning back strode to the bed brushed the soft cheek with his
rough one and hastened out into the hall Zoeth followed him bearing
the lamp At the door of the Captains room they paused

Well good night Zoeth said Shadrach brusquely

Good night Shadrach Thisthis is queer business for you and me
aint it

I should think twas Humph You said this morning that maybe Marcellus
was alongside of us today If he is he knows whats happened dont he

Perhaps he knows that and more Shadrach Perhaps he can see whatll
happen in the future Perhaps he knows that too

Humph Well if he does he knows a heap moren I do Good night




CHAPTER V


MaryGusta awoke next morning to find the sun shining in at the window
of her bedroom She had no means of knowing the time but she was
certain it must be very late and in consequence was almost dressed
when Isaiah knocked at the door to tell her breakfast would be ready
pretty soon A few minutes later she appeared in the kitchen bearing the
pitcher from the washstand in her room

What you doin with that demanded Mr Chase who was leaning against
the doorpost looking out into the yard

I was goin to fill it said the child There wasnt any water to
wash with

Isaiah sniffed I aint had no time to fill wash pitchers he
declared That ones been on my mind for moren a fortnit but Ive
had other things to do You can wash yourself in that basin in the sink
Thats what the rest of us do

MaryGusta obediently washed in the tin basin and rubbed her face and
hands dry upon the roller towel behind the closet door

Am I late for breakfast she asked anxiously

No I guess not Aint had breakfast yet Capn Shads out to the barn
tendin to the horse and Zoeths feedin the hens Theyll be in
pretty soon if we have luck Course its TIME for breakfast but thats
nothing Im the only one that has to think about time in this house

The girl regarded him thoughtfully

You have to work awful hard dont you Mr Chase she said

Isaiah looked at her suspiciously

Huh he grunted Who told you that

Nobody I just guessed it from what you said

Humph Well you guessed right I dont have many spare minutes

Yes sir Are you a perfect slave

Eh What

Mrs Hobbs says she is a perfect slave when she has to work hard

Whos Mrs Hobbs

Shesshe keeps housethat is she used to keep house for my father
over in Ostable I dont suppose she will any more now hes dead Shell
be glad I guess Perhaps she wont have to be a perfect slave now
She used to wear aprons same as you do I never saw a man wear an apron
before Do you have to wear one

Hey Have to No course I dont have to unless I want to

MaryGusta reflected

I suppose she went on after a moment it saves your pants Youd
get em all spotted up if you didnt wear the apron Pneumonia is a good
thing to take out Spots

Isaiah was surprised

What is he asked

Pneumonia    No I dont think thats right Its pneumonia that
makes you sick Somethin else takes out the spots I know now its
ammonia Its very good for spots but you mustnt smell the bottle I
smelled the bottle once and it went right up into my head

What on earth are you talkin about The bottle went up into your
head

No the ammonia smell did It was awful likelike she paused
evidently in search of a simile like sneezin backwards she added
It was terrible

Isaiah laughed I should think twould be he declared Sneezin
backwards Ho ho Thats a good one

MaryGustas eyes were still fixed upon the apron

MrI mean Capn Gould said you was the cook and steward she
observed I dont know as I know what a steward is exactly Is it the
one that stews things

Ha ha roared Isaiah MaryGustas dignity was hurt The color rose
in her cheeks

Was it funny she asked I didnt know I know that a cook cooked
things and a baker baked things so I thought maybe a steward stewed
em

Mr Chase continued to chuckle The girl considered

I see she said with a solemn nod It was funny I guess I remember
now that a friar doesnt fry things He is aa kind of minister Friar
Tuck was one in Robin Hood you know Mrs Bailey read about him to
me Do you like Robin Hood Mr Chase

Isaiah said he didnt callate that he knew anybody of that name The
dialogue was interrupted here by the arrival of Zoeth and a moment
later Captain Shadrach Breakfast was put upon the table in the
diningroom and the quartette sat down to eat

MaryGusta was quiet during the meal she answered when spoken to but
the only questions she asked were concerning David

Hes all right said Captain Shad Lively as can be Hell have a
good time out in that barn theres considerable many mice out there
Likes mice dont he

Yes sir Hes a good mouser Did he look as if he missed me

Eh Well I didnt notice He never mentioned it if he did You can
go see him after breakfast What do you think she can find to do today
Zoeth

Mr Hamilton had evidently considered the problem

I thought maybe shed like to go up to the store long of you and me
he suggested Would you MaryGusta

MaryGusta hesitated Id like to very much she said only

Only what

Only Ive got to see to David and the dolls first Couldnt I come up
to the store afterwards

The Captain answered Why I guess likely you could he said Its
straight up the road to the corner You can see the store from the top
of the hill back here Isaiahll show you the way But you can tend
towhats that cats nameOh yes Davidyou can tend to David
right off Isaiahll give the critter his breakfast and the dolls can
wait til noontime cant they

MaryGustas mind was evidently divided between inclination and duty
Duty won

They aint dressed yet she said gravely And besides they might
think Id gone off and left em and be frightened This is a strange
place to them same as it is to me and David you know None of us have
ever been visitin before

So it was decided that she should wait until her family had been given
parental attention and come to the store by herself The partners left
for their place of business and she and Mr Chase remained at the house
Her first act after leaving the table was to go to the barn and return
bearing the cat in her arms David ate a hearty breakfast and then
after enduring a motherly lecture concerning prudence and the danger of
getting lost was permitted to go out of doors

MaryGusta standing in the doorway gazed after her pet

I hope theres no dogs around here she said It would be dreadful if
there was a dog

Isaiah tried to reassure her Oh I callate there aint no dog nigh
enough to do any harm he said besides most cats can run fast enough
to get out of the way

The child shook her head I didnt mean that she said I meant it
would be dreadful for the dog David doesnt have a mite of patience
with dogs He doesnt wait to see if theyre nice ones or not he just
goes for em and thenOh He most always goes for em When he has
kittens he ALWAYS does

Mr Chases reply to this illuminating disclosure was that he wanted to
know

Yes said MaryGusta David doesnt take to dogs some way Why
dont cats like dogs Mr Chase

Isaiah said that he callated twas the nature of the critters not to
MaryGusta agreed with him

Natures are queer things aint they she said solemnly I guess
everybody has a nature cats and all Mrs Hobbs says my nature is a
contrary one Whats your kind Mr Chase

Do you suppose she said a few moments later when the cook and
steward had shown symptoms of doing something beside lean against the
sink and whistle do you suppose you could get along for a few minutes
while I went up and dressed my dolls

Isaiah turned to stare at her

Well he stammered II callate maybe I could if I tried hard
If you dont beat anything ever I see What are you doin with that
pitcher

The girl was holding the wash pitcher under the pump

Im fillin it she answered Then you wont have to have it on your
mind any more Ill hurry back just as fast as I can

She hastened out bearing the brimming pitcher with both hands Isaiah
gazed after her muttering a word or two and then set about clearing
the breakfast table

She was down again shortly the two favorites Rose and Rosette in her
arms She placed them carefully in the kitchen chair and bade them be
nice girls and watch mother do the dishes

I left the others in the bedroom she explained Minnehaha aint very
well this mornin I guess the excitement was too much for her She is a
very nervous child

Isaiahs evident amusement caused her to make one of her odd changes
from childish makebelieve to grownup practicability

Of course she added with gravity I know she aint really nervous
Shes just full of sawdust same as all dolls are and she couldnt have
any nerves But I like to play shes nervous and delicate Its real
handy to say that when I dont want to take her with me Im a nervous
excitable child myself Mrs Hobbs says so Thats why Ive hardly ever
been anywhere before I guess

She insisted upon wiping the dishes while Isaiah washed them Also she
reminded him that the tablecloth which had been so severely criticized
the previous evening had not as yet been changed The steward was
inclined to treat the matter lightly

Never mind if taint he said Its good enough for a spell longer
Let it stay Besides he added the washin aint been done this week
and there aint another clean one aboard

MaryGusta smiled cheerfully

Oh yes there is she said Theres a real nice one in the bottom
drawer of the closet Ive been huntin and I found it Come and see

She led him into the diningroom and showed him the cloth she had found

Its a real pretty one I think she said Shall we put it on Mr
Chase

No no course not Thats the best tablecloth Dont use that only
when theres companyor Sundays

MaryGusta considered She counted on her fingers

How long have we used this dirty one she asked

Eh Oh I dont know Four or five days maybe Then evidently
feeling that the repetition of the we implied a sense of unwarranted
partnership in the household management he added with dignity That
is IVE seen fit to use it that long

The sarcasm was wasted The girl smiled and nodded

That makes it all right she declared If we put this one on now
itll be Sunday long before its time to change And we can wash the
other one today or tomorrow

Oh WE can eh

Yes sir

Isaiah looked as if he wished to say something but was at a loss for
words The Sunday cloth was spread upon the table while he was still
hunting for them

And now said MaryGusta if youre sure you dont need me any more
just now I guess Id like to go up and see the store May I

Site found the store of Hamilton and Company an exceedingly interesting
place Zoeth and his partner greeted her cordially and she sat down upon
a box at the end of the counter and inspected the establishment It was
not very large but there was an amazing variety in its stock Muslin
tape calico tacks groceries cases of shoes a rack with spools of
thread another containing a few pocket knives barrels half a dozen
salt codfish swinging from nails overhead some suits of oilskins
hanging beside them a tumbled heap of childrens caps and hats even a
glasscovered case containing boxes of candy with placards 1 c each
or 3 for 1 c displayed above them

Like candy do you asked Mr Hamilton noticing her scrutiny of the
case and its contents

Yes sir said MaryGusta

How about sassafras lozengers Like them

Yes sir

She was supplied with a roll of the lozenges and munched them gravely
Captain Shad who had been waiting on a customer regarded her with an
amused twinkle

Sassafras lozengers are good enough for anybody eh he observed

Yes sir replied MaryGusta Then she added politely Only I guess
these are wintergreen

She stayed at the store until noon Then she walked home with the
Captain whose turn it was to dine first that day The hiring of Annabel
had been an unusual break in the business routine Ordinarily but one of
the partners left that store at a time

Well inquired the Captain as they walked down the lane what do
you think of it Pretty good store for a place like South Harniss aint
it

Yes sir

I bet you Different from the Ostable stores eh

Yes sir II guess it is

Umhm Well how different

MaryGusta took her usual interval for consideration

I guess theres moremore things in it with separate smells to em
she said

Captain Shad had no remark to make for a moment MaryGusta however
was anxious to please

Theyre nice smells she hastened to add I like em only I never
smelled em all at the same time before And I like the lozengers VERY
much

The two or three days which Captain Shad had set as the limit of the
childs visit passed as did the next two or three She was busy and
apparently enjoying herself She helped Isaiah with the housework and
although he found the help not altogether unwelcome he was inclined to
grumble a little at what he called her pesterin around

I never see such a youngone he told his employers I dont ask her
to do dishes nor fill pitchers nor nothin she just does it on her own
hook

Humph grunted Captain Shadrach So I judged from what I see Does it
pretty well too dont she

Umhm Well enough I guess Yes with a burst of candor for her
age she does it mighty well

Then what are you kickin about

I aint kickin Who said I was kickin Onlywell all I say is let
her do dishes and such if she wants to onlyonly

Only what

Only I aint goin to have her heavin out hints about what I ought
to do Theres two skippers aboard this craft now and thats enough
By time with another burst that kids a reglar born mother She
mothers that cat and them dolls and the hens already and I swan to
man I believe shed like to adopt me I aint goin to be mothered and
hinted at to do this and that and put to bed and tucked in by no kid
Ill heave up my job first

He had been on the point of heaving up his job ever since the days when
he sailed as cook aboard Captain Shadrachs schooner When the Captain
retired from the sea for the last time and became partner and fellow
shopkeeper with Zoeth Isaiah had retired with him and was engaged to
keep house for the two men The Captain had balked at the idea of a
female housekeeper

Women aboard ship are a dum nuisance he declared Ive carried em
cabin passage and I know Isaiah Chase is a good cook and besides if
the biscuits are more fit for cod sinkers than they are for grub I
can tell him so in the right kind of language We dont want no woman
steward Zoeth you hear ME

Zoeth although the Captains seafaring language was a trial to his
gentle churchly soul agreed with his partner on the main point His
experience with the other sex had not been such as to warrant further
experiment So Isaiah was hired and had been cook and steward at the
South Harniss home for many years But he made it a practice to assert
his independence at frequent intervals although as a matter of fact
he would no more have dreamed of really leaving than his friends and
employers would of discharging him Mr Chase was as permanent a fixture
in that house as the ships chronometer in the diningroom and that was
screwed to the wall

And in spite of his grumbling he and MaryGusta were rapidly becoming
fast friends Shadrach and Zoeth also were beginning to enjoy her
company her unexpected questions her interest in the house and the
store and shrewd oldfashioned comments on persons and things She was
a queer youngone they like the people of Ostable agreed on that
point but Mr Hamilton was inclined to think her ways sort of takin
and the Captain admitted that maybe they were What he would not admit
was that the girls visit although already prolonged for a fortnight
was anything but a visit

I presume likely hinted Zoeth you and mell have to give the Judge
some sort of an answer pretty soon wont we Hell be wantin to know
afore long

Know Know what

Whywhy whether were goin to say yes or no to what Marcellus asked
us in that letter

He does know Furs Im consarned he knows I spoke my mind plain
enough to pound through anybodys skull I should think

Yesyes I know you did But Shadrach if she dont stay here for
good where will she stay She aint got anybody else to go to

She is stayin aint she Sheshes makin us a visit same as I said
she could What more do you want Jumpin fire This fix is your doin
anyway Taint mine If you had paid attention to what I said the
child wouldnt have been here at all

Now Shadrach You know you was the one that would fetch her over that
very day

Oh blame it onto me of course

I aint blamin anybody But shes here and weve got to decide whether
to send her away or not Shall we

They were interrupted by MaryGusta herself who entered the barn
where the discussion took place a doll under one arm and a very serious
expression on her face

Hello hailed Zoeth Whats the matter

MaryGusta seated herself upon an empty cranberry crate The partners
had a joint interest in a small cranberry bog and the crate was one of
several unused the previous fall

Theres nothin the matter she said solemnly Ive been thinkin
thats all

Want to know observed the Captain Well what made you do anything
as risky as that

MaryGustas forehead puckered

I was playin with Jimmie Bacheldor yesterday she said and he made
me think

Abner Bacheldor was the nearest neighbor His ramshackle dwelling was an
eighth of a mile from the GouldHamilton place Abner had the reputation
of being the meanest man in town also he had a large family of which
Jimmie eight years old was the youngest

Humph sniffed Captain Shad So Jimmie Bacheldor made you think eh
I never should have expected it from one of that tribe Howd he do it

He asked me about my relations said MaryGusta and when I said I
hadnt got any he was awful surprised He has ever so many sisters and
brothers and aunts and cousins andOh everything He thought twas
dreadful funny my not havin any I think Id ought to have some dont
you

The partners looking rather foolish said nothing for a moment Then
Zoeth muttered that he didnt know but she had

Yes said MaryGusta II think so You see ImI mean I was a
stepchild long as father was here Now hes dead and I aint even
that And I aint anybodys cousin nor nephew nor niece I just
aint anything Im different from everybody I know Andand very
solemnlyI dont like to be so different

Her lip quivered as she said it Sitting there on the cranberry crate
hugging her dolls she was a pathetic little figure Again the partners
found it hard to answer Mr Hamilton looked at the Captain and the
latter his fingers fidgeting with his watchchain avoided the look The
girl went on

I was thinking she said how nice twould have been if Id had aa
brother or somebody of my very own Ive got children of course but
theyre only dolls and a cat Theyre nice but they aint real folks
I wish I had some real folks Do you suppose ifif I have to go to
thethe orphans home thered be anybody there that would be my
relation I didnt know but there might be another orphan there who
didnt have anybody same as me and then we could make believe we
waswas cousins or somethin That would be better than nothin
wouldnt it

Zoeth stepped forward and bending over kissed her cheek Never you
mind MaryGusta he said You aint gone there yet and afore you do
maybe Capn Shad and I can think up some relations for you

Real relations asked MaryGusta eagerly

Well no not real ones Im afraid we couldnt do that But when
it comes to makebelieve that might be different He hesitated an
instant glanced at the Captain and then added I tell you what
you do you just pretend Im your relation awell an uncle thats
bettern nothin You just call me Uncle Zoeth Thatll be a start
anyhow Think youd like to call me Uncle Zoeth

MaryGustas eyes shone Oh yes she cried Then I could tell that
Jimmie Bacheldor I had one relation anyhow And shall I call Capn
Gould Uncle Shadrach

Zoeth turned to his companion Shall she Shadrach he asked with a
mischievous smile

If it had not been for that smile the Captains reply might have been
different But the smile irritated him He strode to the door

Zoeth Hamilton he snapped how long are you goin to set here If
you aint got anything else to attend to I have Im goin up to the
store Its pretty nigh eight oclock in the mornin and that store
aint open yet

Want to come along MaryGusta asked Zoeth She can come cant
she Shad

Yes yes course she can more genially Callate theres some of
those sassafrascheckerberry lozengers left yet Come on MaryGusta
if you want to

But the child shook her head She looked wistful and a trifle
disappointed

II guess maybe Id better stay here she said I ought to see to
Minnehahas sore throat Im goin to put some red flannel round it
Mr Chase says he callates he knows where there is some Goodby Uncle
Zoeth GoodbyerCapn Gould

The partners did not converse on the way to the store Zoeth made an
attempt but Shadrach refused to answer He was silent and for him
grumpy all the forenoon Another fortnight passed before the subject
of the decision which must sooner or later be given Judge Baxter was
mentioned by either of the pair




CHAPTER VI


MaryGusta was growing accustomed to the life in the South Harniss
home She found it a great improvement over that which she had known
on Phinneys Hill at Ostable There was no Mrs Hobbs to nag and find
fault there were no lonely meals no scoldings when stockings were
torn or face and hands soiled And as a playground the beach was a
wonderland

She and Jimmie Bacheldor picked up shells built sand forts skipped
flat stones along the surface of the water at high tide and picked up
scallops and an occasional quahaug at low water Jimmie was generally
speaking a satisfactory playmate although he usually insisted upon
having his own way and when they got into trouble because of this
insistence did not permit adherence to the truth to obstruct the path
to a complete alibi MaryGusta who had been taught by the beloved
Mrs Bailey to consider lying a deadly sin regarded her companions
lapses with alarmed disapproval but she was too loyal to contradict and
more than once endured reproof when the fault was not hers She had had
few playmates in her short life and this one though far from perfect
was a joy

They explored the house together and found in the big attic and the
stuffy shutup best parlor the most fascinating of treasure hordes The
former with its rows of old trunks and sea chests under the low eaves
the queer garments and discarded hats hanging on the nails the dusky
corners where the light from the little windows scarcely penetrated even
on a sunny May afternoon was the girls especial Paradise Here she
came to play by herself on rainy days or when she did not care for
company Her love of makebelieve and romance had free scope here and
with no Jimmie to laugh and make fun of her imaginings she pretended to
her hearts content Different parts of that garret gradually in her
mind came to have names of their own In the bright spot under the
north window was Home where she and the dolls and Davidwhen the
cat could be coaxed from prowlings and mouse hunts to quiet and
slumberlived and dined and entertained and were ill or well or happy
or frightened according to the days imaginative happenings Sometimes
Home was a castle sometimes a Swiss Family Robinson cave sometimes
a store which transacted business after the fashion of Hamilton and
Company And in other more or less fixed spots and corners were Europe
to which the family voyaged occasionally Niagara FallsMrs Baileys
honeymoon had been spent at the real Niagara the Kings palace the den
of the wicked witch Sherwood Forest and Jordan Marsh and Companys
store in Boston

Jimmie Bacheldor liked the garret well enough but imagination was not
his strongest quality and the best parlor had more charms for him
In that parlor were the trophies of Captain Shadrachs seafaring
dayswhales teeth polished and with pictures of ships upon them the
model of a Chinese junk a seaturtle shell flippers head and all
exactly like a real turtle except as MaryGusta said it didnt have
any works a glass bottle with a model of the bark Treasure Seeker
inside an Eskimo lance with a bone handle and an ivory point a
cocoanut carved to look like the head and face of a funny old man a
Cuban machete and a set of ivory chessmen with Chinese knights and
kings and queens all complete and set out under a glass cover

The junk and the lance and the machete and the rest had a fascination
for Jimmie as they would have had for most boys but for him the
parlors strongest temptation lay in the fact that the children were
forbidden to play there Zoeth and the Captain having been brought up
in New England families of the oldfashioned kind revered their parlor
as a place too precious for use They themselves entered it not
oftener than three times a year and Isaiah went there only when he
felt inclined to dust which was not often Shadrach had exhibited its
treasures to the children one Sunday morning when Zoeth was at church
but he cautioned them against going there by themselves Youd be
liable to break somethin he told them and some of them things in
there you couldnt buy with money Theyve been brought from pretty much
everywheres in creation those things have

But in spite of the warning or because of it Jimmie was as Isaiah
would have said possessed to visit that parlor He coaxed and teased
and dared MaryGusta to take advantage of the stewards stepping out of
the house or being busy in the kitchen to open that parlor door and go
in with him and peep at and handle the treasures MaryGusta protested
but young Bacheldor called her a coward and declared he wouldnt play
with cowards and fraidcats so rather than be one of those detestable
creatures she usually swallowed her scruples and followed the tempter
It was a risk of course but a real adventure and like many
adventurers the pair came to grief They took David into the parlor and
the cat wriggled from its owners arms jumped upon the table knocked
the case containing the chessmen to the floor and not only broke the
glass but decapitated one of the white knights

Even the mild Mr Hamilton was incensed when Isaiah told the news
at supper time And Captain Shad who had bought those chessmen at
Singapore from the savings of a second mates wages lost patience
entirely

Didnt I tell you youngones not to go into that parlor he demanded

Yes sir admitted MaryGusta contritely

Yes by fire I did And you went just the same

Yes sir

And you fetched that everlastinerGoliath in there too Dont you
know youve been a bad girl

Yeyes sir

Zoeth protested She aint a bad girl Shadrach he said You know
she aint

Wellermaybe she aint generally speakin I callate twas that
Bacheldor brat that was responsible but just the same I aint goin
to have it happen any more MaryGusta if you and that
consarnedwhatshisnameJimmiego into that parlor again unless
Isaiah or one of us are with you IIby the jumpin Judas me and
Zoeth wont let you go to the Sunday school picnic There I mean that
and so does Zoeth Shut up Zoeth You do mean it too You know mighty
well either your dad or mine would have skinned us alive if wed done
such a thing when we was youngones And turning to the culprit if
you fetch that cat in there IllIllI dont know what Ill do

The Sunday school picnic was to be held on the second Saturday in
June and MaryGusta wished to attend it She had never been to a real
picnic though the other children in Ostable had described such outings
in glowing colors Now although she a visitor was not a regular
member of the South Harniss Methodist Sunday school the superintendent
personally had invited her to go and Zoeth and the Captain had given
their consent Not to go would be a heartbreaking calamity She finally
resolved to be very very good and obedient from that time on

But good resolutions are broken occasionally even by grownups and in
childhood much can be forgotten in nine days So on the afternoon of
the tenth day which was the day before the picnic MaryGusta walking
alone in the field which separated the GouldHamilton property from that
of Abner Bacheldor Jimmies fatherMaryGusta walking in that field
was depressed and melancholy Her state of mind was indicated by the
fact that she had left all her dolls even Rose and Rosette at home
She felt guilty and wicked and consciencestricken She had been a bad
girl only one other knew how bad she had been and he being guilty
likewise would not betray her But at home Isaiah Chase was as he
said heatin himself to a bile baking apple turnovers for her to
take to the picnic And Captain Shadrach had announced his intention
of bringing her from the store candy and bananas to go into the lunch
basket with the turnovers and sandwiches and cake And the Captain had
that very day called her a good girl If he only knew

There had been a flurry of excitement in the kitchen just after dinner
Mr Bacheldor had appeared at the door with the request that he might
borrer the loan of Capn Goulds shotgun The day before at a quarter
after fourMr Bacheldor was certain as to the time because he had been
layin down two or three minutes on the sofy afore goin out to look at
some wood there was to cut in the shed and Id just got up and looked
at the clock afore I looked out of the settinroom winderlooking out
of that window he had seen a cat running from his henyard with one of
his recently hatched Plymouth Rock chickens in its mouth

If Id had a gun then declared Abner I could have blowed the
critter to thunderandgone But Ill get him next time Let me have the
gun will you Isaiah I know Shadll say its all right when you tell
him

That shotgun was a precious arm It had been given to the Captain years
before by the officers of a sinking schooner whom Shadrachs boats
crew led by Shadrach himself had rescued at a big risk off the Great
South School It had the Captains name with an inscription and date
on a silver plate fastened to the stock Isaiah was not too willing to
lend it but chicken stealing is a capital offense in South Harniss
as it is in most rural communities and the cat caught in the act is
summarily executed

So Mr Chase went to the Captains room and returned with the gun

There you be Ab he said Hope you get the critter

Oh Ill get him all right dont you fret Say Isaiaherer Mr
Bacheldor hesitated Say he went on you couldnt let me have two or
three cartridges could you I aint got none in the house

Isaiah looked more doubtful than ever but he brought the cartridges
After making sure by inquiry and inspection that they were loaded the
borrower started to go

Oh I say Ab Mr Chase called after him know whose cat twas

Mr Bacheldor did not appear to hear so the question was repeated
Abner answered without turning

I know he declared I know all right and hurried on Isaiah looked
after him and sniffed disdainfully

Anybody on earth but that feller he said would have been ashamed
to beg cartridges after beggin the gun but not Ab Bacheldor no sir
Wonder he didnt want to borrer my Sunday hat to practice shootin at

MaryGusta considered shooting a cat the height of cruelty and
dreadfulness but she was aware of the universal condemnation of chicken
stealing and kept her thought to herself Besides she had her own
wickedness to consider

She walked slowly on across the field bound nowhere in particular
thinking hard and feeling very wretched and miserable The pleasure of
the next day the day she had been anticipating was spoiled already
for her If she went to that picnic without making a full and free
confession she knew she would feel as mean and miserable as she was
feeling now And if she did confess why then

Her meditations were interrupted in a startling manner She was midway
of the field upon the other side of which was a tumbledown stone wall
and a cluster of wild cherry trees and bayberry bushes marking the
boundary of the Bacheldor land From behind the wall and bushes sounded
the loud report of a gun then the tramp of running feet and an excited
shouting

You missed him screamed a voice You never hit him at all There he
goes There he goes Give him tother barrel quick

MaryGusta who had been startled nearly out of her senses by the shot
and the shouting stood perfectly still too surprised and frightened
even to run And then out of the bushes before her darted a scared
tortoiseshell cat frantically rushing in her direction The cat was
David

Hes hidin in them bushes shouted the voice again Stay where you
be Pop Ill scare him out and then you give it to him

MaryGusta stood still no longer The sight of her idolized pet running
for his life was enough to make her forget fright and everything else
She too ran but not toward home

David she screamed Oh David Come here David

David may have recognized the voice but if so the recognition made no
difference The cat kept straight on The girl ran across its path
It dodged and darted into a beachplum thicket a culdesac of tangled
branches and thick grass Before the animal could extricate itself
MaryGusta had seized it in her arms It struggled and fought for
freedom but the child held it tight

David she panted Oh dont David Please be still They shant
hurt you I wont let em Please

Through the bushes above the wall appeared the freckled face of
Conchristened CorneliusBacheldor Con was Jimmies elder brother

He must have got through he shouted Heno there he is Shes got
him Pop Make her put him down

Mr Abner Bacheldor crashed through to his sons side He was carrying a
gun

You put that cat down screamed Con threateningly

MaryGusta said nothing Her heart was beating wildly but she held the
struggling David fast

Its that kid over to Shad Goulds declared Con Make her give you a
shot Pop

Mr Abner Bacheldor took command of the situation

Here you he ordered Fetch that critter here I want him

Still MaryGusta did not answer She was pale and her small knees
shook but she neither spoke nor moved from where she stood And her
grip upon the cat tightened

Fetch that cat here repeated Abner Were goin to shoot him hes
been stealin our chickens

At this accusation and the awful threat accompanying it MaryGusta
forgot her terror of the Bacheldors of the gun forgot everything
except her pet and its danger

I shant she cried frantically I shant He aint Hes my cat and
he dont steal chickens

Yes he does too roared Con Pop and I see him doin it

You didnt I dont believe it When did you see him

Yesterday afternoon We see him didnt we Pop

You bet your life we did growled Abner And he was on my land again
just now comin to steal more I callate Fetch him here

II shant He shant be shot even if he did steal em And I know
he didnt If you shoot him IllIll tell Uncle Zoeth andand Capn
Gould And I wont let you have him anyhow I wont with savage
defiance If you shoot him youll have to shoot me too

Con climbed over the wall You just wait Pop he said Ill take him
away from her

But his father hesitated There were certain reasons why he thought it
best not to be too arbitrary

Hold on Con he said Look here sis Im sorry to have to kill your
cat but Ive got to He steals chickens and them kind of cats has to be
shot I see him myself yesterday afternoon I told Isaiah Chase myself
that    why you was there and heard me You heard me tell how I was
lookin out of the winder at quartet past four and see that cat

MaryGusta interrupted Her expression changed She was still
dreadfully frightened but in her tone was a note of relief of confident
triumph

You didnt see him she cried It wasnt David it wasnt this cat
you saw I KNOW it wasnt

Well I know it was Now dont argue no more You fetch that cat here
or Ill have Con take him away from you Hurry up

I know it wasnt David began MaryGusta Then as Con started in her
direction she turned and ran ran as hard as she could bearing David
in her arms Con ran after her

It was the cat that saved the situation and its life at the same time
MaryGusta was near the edge of the pine grove and Con was close at her
heels David gave one more convulsive desperate wriggle slid from the
girls arms and disappeared through the pines like a gray projectile

MaryGusta collapsed on the grass and burst into frightened hysterical
sobs Con took one or two steps after the flying cat and gave up the
chase Mr Bacheldor from behind the wall swore emphatically and at
length

Come here Con you fool he yelled when the expression of his true
feelings had reached a temporary end Come here let the kid alone
Well get into trouble if we dont As for that dummed cat well get
him next time Hell see his finish Come on I tell you

Con reluctantly rejoined his parent and the pair departed muttering
threats MaryGusta the tears running down her cheeks ran home to
find David and plead with Mr Chase for her pets safety and protection
from its persecutors But Isaiah had gone up to the store on an errand
David however was crouching a trembling heap under the kitchen
stove The girl pulled him out fled with him to the garret and there
with the door locked sat shivering and sobbing until Captain Shad came
home for supper that night

The Captains first question when he arrived was concerning
MaryGustas whereabouts Isaiah said he had not seen her for two hours
or more And just then the child herself appeared entering the kitchen
from the door leading to the back stairs

Hello MaryGusta hailed Shadrach Thought you was lost Suppers
about ready to put on the table Why whats the matter Been cryin
aint you

MaryGusta went straight to him and clutched his hand Please Capn
Gould she begged will you come into the sittinroom a minute II
want to ask you somethin I want you to do somethin for me will you

Sartin sure I will What is it

MaryGusta glanced at Isaiahs face IdId rather tell you just
you alone she said Please come into the sittinroom

She tugged at his hand Much puzzled he followed her through the
diningroom and into the sittingroom

Well MaryGusta he said kindly now what is it Whats the big
secret

MaryGusta closed the door She was very solemn and her lip quivered
but she did not hesitate

Its about David she said Somethins happened to David IIm
goin to tell you about it Capn Gould

She told of her adventure and of Davids peril Shadrach listened When
he heard of the accusation which was the cause of the affair he shook
his head

My my he exclaimed Thats pretty bad that is Id hate to have
your cat killed MaryGusta land knows I would But if the critters a
chicken thief

But he aint I KNOW he aint

Humph You cant always tell you know cats are cats and

But I know David wasnt the cat that did it I KNOW he wasnt

Oh you know do you Hm you do seem pretty sartin thats a fact How
do you know

The girl looked at him Please Capn Gould she said IId rather
tell you over to Mr Bacheldors Thats what I wanted to ask you wont
you please go right over to Mr Bacheldors with me IIll tell you
how I know when were there

Captain Shadrach was more puzzled than ever You want me to go to Ab
Bacheldors with you he repeated You want to tell me somethin over
there Why not tell me here

Causecause Mr Bacheldor thinks David did it and hell kill him
He said he would I want HIM to know David wasnt the one And if if
youre there when he knows hell know YOU know he knows and he wont
dast shoot at David any more Please come Capn Gould Please right
away

Shadrach tugged at his beard Humph he muttered Theres more
knows in that than there is knots in a snarled fish line You want me
as a witness nighs I can make out Is that it

Yes sir Will you go with me right off

Right off eh Cant it wait till after supper

II dont want any supper PLEASE

So supper was postponed in spite of Isaiahs grumblings and the
Captain and MaryGusta started forthwith for the home of their nearest
neighbor Mr Chase his curiosity aroused would have asked a dozen
questions but MaryGusta would neither answer nor permit Shadrach to
do so

The Bacheldor family were at supper when the callers arrived Abner
himself opened the door and he looked rather embarrassed when he saw the
pair on the steps Captain Shad did not wait for an invitation to enter
he walked in and MaryGusta followed him

Now then Ab said the Captain briskly whats this about our cat
stealin your chickens

Mr Bacheldor and Con separately and together burst into a tirade of
invective against the offending David

Thats all right thats all right broke in the Captain crisply If
that cat stole your chicken it ought to be shot But are you sure of the
cat Do you know ours did it This girl here says twasnt ours at all

I know a dum sight better began Abner savagely But this time it was
MaryGusta who interrupted

Capn Gould she said please ask him what time it was yesterday
afternoon when he saw the cat run off with the chicken

Bacheldor did not wait to be asked

Twas quarterpast four yesterday afternoon he declared I know the
time

I dont see what the times got to do with it put in Shadrach

But its got everything to do with it urged MaryGusta Honest
truly it has

Oh it has eh Why

CausecauseAsk him if hes sure

Again Abner did not wait Course Im sure he replied I told Isaiah
Chaseyes and I told that youngone toothat I looked at the clock
just afore I looked out of the window and see the critter in the very
act Yes and Con see him too

MaryGusta stamped her foot in triumph Then it wasnt David
she said It wasnt David at all Twas somebody elses cat Mr
Bacheldor

Somebody elses nothin Dont you suppose I know

Hold on Heave to Ab MaryGusta how do you know twasnt our cat

Causecause David was with me from four oclock till most five
thats how He was in thein our house with me So triumphantly he
couldnt have been anywhere else could he

Con and his father both began a protest but Shadrach cut it short

Keep still for mercy sakes he ordered This aint Shoutin
Methodist camp meetin Lets get soundins here Now MaryGusta you
say the cat was with you from four till five youre sure of that

Yes sir I know because Mr Chase had gone out and we knew he wouldnt
be back until five cause he said he wouldnt So we looked at the clock
before we went in

Went in Went in where

The girl hung her head It was evident that the answer to this question
was one she dreaded to make But she made it nevertheless

Before we went intointo the parlor she said faintly

Captain Shad was the only one of her hearers who grasped the full
significance of this confession No there was one other and he turned
red and then white

The parlor repeated the Captain slowly The best parlor

Yeyes sir

Do you mean you went into the best parlor over to our house andAND
TOOK THAT CAT IN WITH YOU

Yes sir

Well I swan to man Did you forget what I told you would happen if you
went into that parlor again And especially if you lugged that cat in
Did you forget that

Nno sir I didnt forget it Youyou said I couldnt go to the
picnic

Shadrach shook his head Well he groaned if this dont beat the
nation What under the sun did you do it for

Causecause we wanted to play pirates withwith the swords and
things faltered MaryGusta And we took David cause he was goin to
be one of the passengers on the ship we took But with a sudden return
to the main point at issue that proves David wasnt the cat he saw
the one that stole his chicken

The Captain looked at her By fire it does thats right he
muttered Abner Bacheldor roared in indignation

It dont prove nothin he cried All it proves is that the kids a
liar Shes lyin sos to save that dummed thief of a cat All kidsll
lie when they think they can make somethin out of it

Shadrach grunted Maybe so he said but I aint caught this one in
a lie so far And I doubt if shes lyin now Now MaryGusta is
there any way you can prove you was in that parlor andwhats his
nameDavid was there at the time you say Is there

Again MaryGusta hesitated Her eyes wandered about the faces in the
room until their gaze rested upon the face of Jimmie Bacheldor And
Jimmie looked white and scared

Nno sir II guess not she faltered

I guess not too declared Con with a sarcastic laugh

But the Captain was suspicious He had seen the childs look

Hold on he commanded Theres more to this than a blind man could
see through a board fence MaryGusta was there anybody else except
David in that parlor along with you Was there

MaryGusta looked at the floor

Yes sir she faltered

So I kind of had an idea there might be Who was it

Again the look and then II aint goin to tell

Con laughed once more You bet she aint he exclaimed She cant
The whole yarns a lie Dont pay no attention to it Pop

Shadrach turned sharply in his direction IM payin attention to it
he snapped and thats enough So you aint goin to tell MaryGusta
eh Remember now if you do tell itll prove your storys true and
Davidll come out on top Think it over

Evidently MaryGusta was thinking it over Her eyes filled with tears
but she shook her head

The Captain looked down at her Keepin mum eh he said Well
thats all right I callate were pretty good guessers some of us
anyway Jim with a sudden look straight at the youngest member of
his neighbors family who was fidgeting with his spoon and acting
remarkably nervous what have you got to say Have a good time in that
parlor playin pirates did you

Jimmie gasped The suddenness of the attack knocked his defenses flat
He gurgled stammered and then broke into a wail of distress

II didnt mean to he sobbed wildly Twas her She said do it I
never II

Why Jimmie Bacheldor exclaimed MaryGusta shocked into protest by
her fellow culprits distortion of the truth How can you say so What
a story You know

I guess he knows broke in Shadrach And I callate I know too
Now then Jim what time was it when you looked at the clock Shut up
Abner let the boy answer Tell us Jim nobodyll hurt you

Itit was four oclock hollered Jimmie in agony II never done
it a purpose I wont do so no more

No I dont callate you will Callate you wont have a chance Well
Ab I guess weve proved our clients case Next time you go out cat
shootin you better be sure youre gunnin for the right one Come on
MaryGusta

Con Bacheldor sprang to his feet

Pop he shouted be you goin to let em go this way And that cat
stealin our chickens right along Aint you goin to tell em youll
kill the critter next time he comes on our land

Abner was silent He seemed oddly anxious to see the last of his
visitors It was the Captain who spoke

No Con he said crisply he aint goin to tell me that And you
listen while I tell YOU somethin If that cat of ours gets hurt or
dont show up some time Ill know whos responsible And thenwell
then maybe ILL go gunnin Good night all hands

All the way back across the fields and through the grove the Captain was
silent MaryGusta clinging to his hand was silent too dreading what
she knew was sure to follow When they entered the kitchen Shadrach
turned to her

Well MaryGusta he said Im glad your cats turned out to be no
chicken thief butbut that dont alter what you did does it

No sir stammered the girl

No Im afraid it dont I told you what would happen if you went into
that parlor and you went just the same I callate you know what to
expect dont you

Yeyes sir in a low tone You mean I cant go to the Sunday school
picnic

Shadrach cleared his throat He was not enjoying this episode as a
matter of fact his unhappiness was almost as keen as the childs But as
a boy he had been reared in the oldfashioned way and he felt that he
had a duty to perform

Im afraid thats what I mean he said gravely Now set down and
have your supper

MaryGusta tried hard to be brave but the disappointment was too
great The tears streamed down her cheeks and she ran from the room
Shadrach strode after her

Here he called MaryGusta where are you goin Come back and have
your supper

But MaryGusta did not come back She was already on the stairs

II dont want any supper she sobbed Please oh PLEASE dont make
me eat it

The Captain hesitated turned back and jerked his own chair to the
table

Well he demanded brusquely the suppers here and somebodys got to
eat it I callate Fetch it on Isaiah What are you starin at me like
that for you dumbhead

Isaiah brought in the supper Then he demanded to know what the fuss was
all about Shadrach told him Isaiahs chief interest seemed to center
on the attempted shooting

Why the son of a swab he cried excitedly Of all the cheek I ever
heard of in my life that Abner Bacheldors got the heft To borrer a
mans own gunyes and cartridges tooto kill that mans own cat
with Of all the solid brass He never told me twas our cat All he
wanted to know was could he borrer your gun and somethin to load it
with If Id known

His employer interrupted him WHAT he roared Do you mean to say
that Ab Bacheldor came here and borrowed MY gun toto do what he done
with

Sartin sure he did And only this very afternoon too

And did he know whose cat twas

He said he did MaryGusta was here long with me when he come I
says Know whose cat tis and says he I know all right I thought
he acted kind of sheepish and funny IHere where you goin

The Captain was on his feet and his cap was in his hand

Goin he snarled Im going to make another call on Abner And
with his hand on the latch if you hear somebody bein murdered over in
that direction you neednt call the constable neither

Butbut hold on Capn Shad You aint finished your own supper yet
and Zoeths waiting up to the store for you to come back sos he can
come down and get his

The reply was emphatic and in its way conclusive

To the blue brimstone with the supper roared Shadrach It can wait
and so can Zoeth If he cant he can do the next best

He was absent for half an hour When he returned Mr Hamilton was in the
diningroom Shadrach entered bearing the precious shotgun He stood it
carefully in the corner There was a satisfied look in his eye

For goodness sake Shadrach exclaimed Zoeth what have you been
thinkin of There I was waitin and waitin and hankerin and hankerin
and no you nor no supper I had to lock up the store finally Twas
either that or starve I aint a faultfinder generally speakin but I
have to eat same as other folks

His partner paid not the least attention His first remark was in the
form of a question addressed to Mr Chase

Look here Isaiah he demanded did I understand you to say that
MaryGusta was with you when that sculpin come to borrow my gun

Yup She was here

And she knew that he was goin to shoot a cat with it

Sartin she heard him say so

Shadrach strode to the mantel took from it a handlamp lighted the
lamp and with it in his hand walked from the room and ascended the
stairs Zoeth called after him but he did not answer

He entered MaryGustas room The child was in bed the dolls beside
her She was not asleep however The tear stains on her cheeks and the
dampness of the pillow showed how she had spent the time since leaving
the diningroom

Shadrach put the lamp upon the washstand pulled a chair beside the bed
and sat down He took her hand in his

MaryGusta he said gently you knew twas my gun that Ab Bacheldor
was tryin to shoot David with

MaryGusta moved her head up and down on the pillow

Yes sir she said

You was here when he borrowed it

Yes sir And then I knew it was yours when he had it there in the
field I saw the silver name thing on the handle It kind of shined in
the sun

Umhm Yes yes I see You knew it of course But you didnt tell me
Why on earth didnt you Didnt you know that if Id realized that swab
had borrered my gun to kill my cat that would have been enough If the
critter had stole a million chickens twouldnt have made any difference
if Id known THAT The cheeky lubber Well he wont shoot at anything
of ours for one spell Ill bet But why didnt you tell me

MaryGustas answer was promptly given

Why cause she said that was just it I knew if you knew that you
wouldnt care whether David stole the chicken or not And I wanted you
to know he didnt

Um I see But if you had told me you wouldnt have had to tell about
the parlor ID never asked a single question

Yeyes sir but I wanted you to know David doesnt steal chickens

Shadrach swallowed hard I see he said Yes yes I see So just to
clear that cat you was willin to give up the picnic and everything

MaryGusta sobbed II did want to go so she moaned

The Captain lifted her from the pillow and put his arm about her

You ARE goin he declared emphatically you just bet youre goin

Oh Oh am I Am I really II know I hadnt ought to I was a bad
girl

You Youre a dummed good girl The best and squarestyes and the
spunkiest little girl I ever saw Youre a brick

Im awful sorry I went into the parlor Capn Gould

Blast the parlor I dont care if you stay in there a week and smash
everything in it Andand see here MaryGusta dont you call me
Capn Gould any more Call me Uncle Shad will you


Just before bedtime that night Mr Hamilton broached a subject which had
troubled him all day

Shadrach he said timidly II guess I ought to tell you somethin
I know you wont want to talk about it but seems s if I must tell you
I had a letter this morning from Judge Baxter He says he cant wait
much longer for an answer from us about Marcelluss girl Hes got to
know what weve decided to do with her

Shadrach who was smoking took his pipe from his mouth

Well give him the answer then he said shortly You know what tis
well as I do

Zoeth looked troubled

I know you dont want to keep her he said but

Who said I didnt

Who Why Shadrach Gould You said

I said a good many things maybe but thats nothin You knew what I
meant as well as I did

Why Shadrach Youyou dont mean you ARE willin to keep herhere
with us for good You dont mean THAT

The Captain snorted impatiently Dont be so foolish Zoeth he
protested You knew plaguey well I never meant anything else




CHAPTER VII


The next day Captain Shadrach drove to Ostable and spent several hours
in consultation with Judge Baxter Adjusting matters by correspondence
is a slow process at best and the Captain having surrendered
unconditionally was not the man to delay

I can settle more in ten minutes talk he told his partner than the
three of us could in a months letterwritin especially if I had to
write any of the letters I never was any hand to write letters you
know that Zoeth And when I do write one the feller I send it to is
liable to come around and ask me to read it cause he cant Like as not
I cant either if its had time to get cold and there we are right
where we started No Ill go and see the Judge and when I fetch port
tonight therell have been somethin done

This prophecy was fulfilled Before the Captain left Ostable for the
homeward drive a good deal had been done Judge Baxter in his capacity
as administrator had already been looking into the affairs of his late
client and as he had expected those affairs were badly tangled When
the outstanding debts were paid there would be little left a thousand
or two perhaps but certainly no more

So there you are Shadrach he said Im mighty glad you and Zoeth
have decided to keep the girl but Im afraid shell come to you with
very little property of her own If she is to have the good education
and all the rest that Marcellus wanted her to have I guess itll be your
money that pays for it Thats the honest truth and I think you ought
to know it

The Captain nodded Thats all right he said I expected just about
that account of what you said the day of the funeral Me and Zoeth are
about as fur from bein rich as the ships cat is from bein skipper
but weve put by a little and the store fetches us in a decent livin
Well take the youngone and do our best by her Land knows what that
bestll be he added with a dubious shake of the head Speakin for
myself I feel that Im about as competent to bring up a child as a clam
is to fly

Baxter laughed Marcellus seemed confident that you and Hamilton were
perfectly suited to the job he said

Um yes I know Marcellus had confidence in a good many things the
stock market included However what is to be will be and we all have to
take chances as the feller that was just married said when he tackled
his wifes first mince pie You get those guardian papers whatever
they are made out and Zoeth and mell sign em As for the competent
partwell with a chuckle that childs pretty competent herself
I have a notion that take it five or six years from now itll be her
thatll be bringin us up in the way we should go I feel a good deal as
if I was signin on for a long voyage with the chances that Id finish
mate instead of skipper

Say Judge he added just before leaving for home theres one
thing more Id like to say Most everybody thinks Marcellus left his
stepdaughter a considerble sight of money dont they

Why yes I suppose they do

All right let em think so Twill give em somethin to talk about
Theyll be guessin how rich the child is instead of markin off in the
almanac the days afore Zoeth and me head for the poorhouse

Humph I see You dont care to have it known that you and your partner
are adopting and supporting her purely from motives of kindness and
generosity

Pooh pooh No generosity about it Besides Marcellus was kind and
generous enough to us in the old days Pity if we couldnt take our
trick at the wheel now

The Judge smiled Youre a good deal more willing to take that trick
than you were when I saw you last Captain Shad he observed You seem
to have changed your mind completely

The Captain grinned Well yes I have he admitted Maybe taint
so big a change as you think I have a habit of blowin up a squall when
Im gettin ready to calm down But anyway that youngone would change
anybodys mind Shes different from any girl of her age ever I saw
Shes pretty as a little picture and sweet and wholesome as aas a
summer sweet apple She dont pester and she dont tease and she dont
lieno sir not even when Id consider layin the course a pint or
two from the truth a justifiable proceedin Shes got inside my vest
somehow or nother and I did think I was considerble of a hardshell
Shes all right MaryGusta is Im about ready to say Thank you to
Marcellus

And so it was settled and MaryGusta Lathrop was no longer a visitor
but a permanent member of the odd household at South Harniss She was
delighted when she heard the news although characteristically she
said very little beyond confiding to her two uncles that she was
going to be a good girl and not take David into the parlor again The
remainder of her things and belongings were sent over by the Judge
and in due time the guardianship papers were signed

There exclaimed Zoeth laying down the pen That settles it I
callate Now MaryGusta youre our little girl mine and your Uncle
Shads for good and all

Not quite so long as that Zoeth put in the smiling Shadrach Well
hang on to her for a spell I shouldnt wonder but one of these days
a hundred years from now or such matter theres liable to be a
goodlookin young feller sparkin round here and hell want to marry
her and take her somewheres else Whatll you say when it comes to that
MaryGusta

MaryGusta thought it over If twas a hundred years from now she
said I guess he wouldnt want me

The Captain laughed uproariously Well maybe we can discount that
hundred some for cash he admitted Make it twelve or fifteen years
Then suppose somebodyerer with a wink at Zoethsuppose Jimmie
Bacheldor well say comes and wants us to put you in his hands
whatll you say then

The answer was prompt enough this time

Ill say no asserted MaryGusta with decision Jimmie Bacheldor
hates to wash his hands he told me so

All that summer she played about the house or at the store or on the
beach and when the fall term began the partners sent her to school
They were happy and proud men when Miss Dobson the primary teacher
said the girl was too far advanced for the first class and entered her
in the second Just natural smartness Captain Shadrach declared
Natural smartness and nothin else She aint had a mite of advantages
but up she goes just the same Why Teacher told me she considered her a
reglar parachute

A parachutes somethin that comes down aint it suggested Zoeth
remembering the balloon ascension he had seen at the county fair

Humph So tis Seems as if twasnt parachute she said
Twastwas

Parasol suggested Isaiah who was an interested listener

No no nor paralysis neither Paragon thats what twas Teacher said
that child was a paragon

Whats a paragon asked Mr Chase

I dont know But its what she is anyway

The paragon continued to progress in her studies Also she continued
more and more to take an interest in the housework and the affairs of
her adopted uncles and Isaiah Chase Little by little changes came
in the life of the family On one memorable Sunday Captain Shadrach
attended church It was the first time in a good many years and whether
the congregation or Zoeth or the Captain himself was the more astonished
at the latters being there is a question MaryGusta was not greatly
astonished It was the result of careful planning on her part planning
which had as its object the relieving of Mr Hamiltons mind Zoeth
never missed a Sunday service or a Friday night prayer meeting And
being sincerely religious he was greatly troubled because his friend
and partner took little interest in such things

Shadrachs aversion to churches dated back to a sermon preached by a
former minister The subject of that sermon was Jonah and the whale The
Captain having been on several whaling voyages in his younger days had
his own opinion concerning the prophets famous adventure

If the minister had been a younger and more tactful man the argument
which followed might have ended pleasantly and the break have been
avoided But the clergyman was elderly as set in his ways as the
Captain was in his and the disagreement was absolute and final

The feller is a regular woodenhead declared Shadrach hotly I was
willin to be reasonable I was willin to give in that this Jonah man
might have been out of his head and after he was hove overboard and
cast ashore thought hed been swallowed by a whale or somethin or
nother I picked up a sailor once whod drifted around in a boat for a
week and he couldnt remember nothin of what happened after the first
day or so If youd told him hed been swallowed by a mackerel he
wouldnt have said no But Ive helped kill a good many whalesyes and
Ive helped cut em up tooand I know what they look like inside No
man whether his name was Jonah or Jehoshaphat could have lived three
days in a whales stomach Howd he breathe in there eh Callate the
whale had ventilators and a skylight in his main deck Howd the whale
live all that time with a man hoppin round inside him Think Id live
if Iif I swallowed a live mouse or somethin No siree Either
that mouse would die or I would I bet you Ive seen a whole parcel
of things took out of a whales insides and some of the things had been
alive once too but they wasnt alive then they was in chunks and part
digested Jonah wasnt digested was he And the whale wasnt dead
of dyspepsy neither Thats what I told that minister You try it
yourself I says to him Theres whales enough back of the Crab Ledge
twenty mile off Orham said I Youre liable to run in sight of em
most any fair day in summer You go off there and jump overboard some
time and see what happens First place no whale would swallow you next
place if it did twould chew you or sift you fine first and third
place if you was whole and alive that whale would be dead inside of
ten minutes You try it and see Good fair offer wasnt it But did
he take it up Not much Said I was a scoffer and an infidel and didnt
know anything about Scripture I know about whales anyhow I told
him And he slammed off and wouldnt speak to me again Dont talk to
ME Ill never go inside that meetinhouse again

And he never had until MaryGusta coaxed him into it She was a regular
attendant at Sunday school but on Sunday mornings in pleasant weather
she had been accustomed to take a walk with Shadrach These walks they
both enjoyed hugely but one bright morning she announced that she was
not going for a walk but was going to church with Uncle Zoeth Shadrach
was disappointed and astonished

Land sakes Whats this mean he demanded Thought you liked to walk
with me

I do I like it very much But I dont think its fair for me to do it
every Sunday Uncle Zoeth ALWAYS goes to church and he feels real bad
cause you dont go He told me so He says the church folks think you
wont go to Heaven when you die and that makes him feel dreadful Hes
goin to Heaven you know

Oh he is eh

Of course He couldnt help it hes so good Dont you think hell go
to Heaven Uncle Shad

Who Zoeth Sartin I do If he dont nobody will

Wouldnt it make you feel bad if you was afraid he wouldnt go there

Humph Maybe so but I aint afraid

I know but he is afraid YOU wont He thinks an awful lot of you as
much as you do of him you know Uncle Shad Im goin to meetin with
Uncle Zoeth this mornin and I want you to go with us will you

The Captain pulled his beard

Look here MaryGusta he said Whats all this about anyway You
dont callate Id take you walkin Sundays if I thought twas wicked
do you

No sir but Uncle Zoeth thinks not goin to church is wicked If you
and I went to church with him twould please him ever so much

Maybe so but twould please you and me if he went walkin with us
Ive asked him times enough Why cant he do what I want as well as my
doin what he wants

Cause he thinks its wrong You dont think goin to church is wrong
do you Uncle Shad

Shadrach shook his head By fire he exclaimed Youre a regular
young lawyer you are MaryGusta Judge Baxter hasnt got you beat
when it comes to makin out a case Look here now be honest hadnt
you rather go to walk with me than go to that meetinhouse

Yes sir frankly Id rather

Oh you had eh But all the same you want us to give up our walk and
go to church every Sunday just to please Zoeth Is that it

MaryGusta took his hand No sir she said shyly but I thought
perhaps we could divide up You and I could go with him one Sunday and
to walk the next Sunday That would be fair Im his little girl same as
I am yours Uncle Shad aint I

Shadrach was stumped and he went to church that Sunday morning The
sermon had nothing to do with Jonah or the whale so his feelings
were not ruffled Zoeth was mightily pleased and MaryGusta was happy
because he was The plan of alternate Sundays was adopted It was but
one instance of the managing quality which the girl possessed Isaiah
declared that she wound all hands around her little finger but even he
seemed to enjoy the winding

As she grew older MaryGusta learned more and more concerning her
uncles their habits their contrasting temperaments and their past
history She learned a little of Hall and Company the prosperous firm
of which they had been partners with Marcellus Hall her stepfather
as the head Isaiah told her a little concerning the firm No bigger on
Cape Cod he declared She asked why it had not continued in business
Mr Chase brusquely answered that it hadnt thats all and would not
give any particulars She questioned the steward concerning Shadrach
and Zoeth The former had never married that was funny why hadnt he
Isaiah said he did not know Hadnt Uncle Zoeth ever married either
Yes Zoeth had married

Who did began MaryGusta but Isaiah cut short the catechizing

You mustnt ask such questions he declared

Why mustnt I

Cause you mustnt Your uncles wouldnt like it a mite if they knew
you was pryin into their affairs You mustnt ever say a word about
your Uncle Zoeths gettin married

Wouldnt he like me any more if I did

No you bet he wouldnt hedI dont knows he wouldnt come to hate
you And you mustnt say it to Capn Shad neither

The idea of being hated by Uncle Zoeth was a dreadful one and
MaryGusta avoided the tabooed subject But she thought about it a good
deal She noticed that in neither of the two lots in the cemetery one
where the Goulds were buried and the other the Hamiltons was a stone
erected to the memory of the beloved wife of Zoeth Hamilton although
other beloved wives of the former generations were commemorated This
seemed odd As her education progressed she read more and more and from
her reading she built up several imaginative romances with Zoeth as the
hero and as the heroines beautiful creatures who had died young in
shipwreck probably and whose names were not to be mentioned because
   She could not find a satisfactory solution of the because
Shipwreck or burial at sea she deduced from the fact of there being no
grave in the cemetery Mothers and fathers of several of her schoolmates
had been buried at sea Perhaps the late Mrs Hamilton had been so
buried But Zoeth had never been a seafaring man

One Saturday afternoonshe was about ten years old at the timeshe
was in the garret The garret had taken the place of the old surrey at
Ostable and thither she retired when she wished to be alone to read or
play or study This afternoon she was rummaging through the old trunks
and sea chests in search of a costume for Rose It was to be a masculine
costume of course for there was no feminine apparel in that garret
but in the games which the girl played when alone with her dolls Rose
the largest of the family was frequently obliged to change her sex with
her raiment

MaryGusta had ransacked these trunks and chests pretty thoroughly on
previous occasions but this time she made a discovery In an old trunk
which had obviously belonged to Captain Shadrach she found a sort of
pocket on the under side of the lid a pocket closing with a flap and a
catch In this pocket were some papers old receipts and the like and a
photograph The photograph interested her exceedingly It was yellow and
faded but still perfectly distinct

There was a large building standing on posts fixed in the sand and
beyond it were wharves and a glimpse of schooners and the sea Barrels
a good many barrels were piled upon the wharves and at the end of the
building Over the door was the sign Hall and Company Wholesale Fish
Dealers

This sign of itself was interesting enough Evidently here was the
place where her stepfather and Captain Gould and Mr Hamilton had done
business years before But more interesting still was the group of men
standing on the platform under the sign There were four of these men
dressed in clothes and hats whichespecially the hatslooked queer and
oldfashioned now Two of the men MaryGusta recognized or thought
she did They were Captain Shadrach and Mr Hamilton Much younger they
looked of course their hair was not gray and Zoeth wore a beard while
Shadrach had only a mustache But in spite of these things and the
odd clothes they wore she was sure she recognized them And having
recognized them she also recognized the man in the center of the group
as her stepfather Captain Marcellus Hall The fourth man evidently
younger than the others a handsome squareshouldered chap in his
shirtsleeves she did not know

She turned the photograph over On its back was written

 Firm of Hall and Company Taken August 19th 1877
 Marcellus Hall
 Zoeth J Hamilton
 Edgar S Farmer
 Shadrach B Gould

The names were in differing handwritings Evidently each man had signed
the photograph

MaryGusta scrutinized the photograph again Then with it in her hand
she descended to the kitchen Isaiah was sitting in a chair by the stove
reading a newspaper

Mr Chase said MaryGusta who was Edgar S Farmer

If that kitchen chair had been the nevertobeforgotten piece of
furniture with the music box beneath it and that box had started to
play Isaiah could not have risen more promptly He literally jumped
to his feet and the paper flew from his hands He whirled upon the
questioner

What he demanded Whats that you said

He was pale actually pale MaryGusta was frightened

Whywhy I just asked she faltered I just asked whowhoWhat
CAN be the matter Mr Chase

Isaiah waved his hand WHAT did you ask he demanded

I askedI asked who Edgar S Farmer was thats all I didnt meanI
didnt know

Be still Be still for mercy sakes What do you know about Ed Farmer
Who told you about him

The girl was more frightened than ever Isaiahs next move did not tend
to reassure her He strode to the door looked up the lane and closed
and locked the door before she could find words to answer

Now then he said coming close to her and looking her straight in
the face who told you about Ed Farmer

Nobody told me Honest they didnt

Somebody must have told you else how did you know

MaryGusta hesitatingly held up the photograph Its written on this
she said

Mr Chase snatched it from her hand He looked at the picture and then
at her

Its written on the back went on the girl

Isaiah turned the photograph over

Humph he said suspiciously I see Who gave this to you

Nobody gave it to me I found it in an old trunk up in the attic

Humph You did eh Well I swan to man Have you showed it to anybody
else but me

No sir Honest I havent I just found it this minute

Well I swan thats lucky Twas in a trunk eh Whose trunk

One of Uncle Shads I guess

Humph I presume likely Well what made you ask aboutabout the one
you did ask about

I knew who the others were I knew my father and Uncle Zoeth and Uncle
Shad But I didnt know who the Farmer one was It says Firm of Hall
and Company and all those names are signed So I thought maybe Mr
Farmer was

Never you mind who he was He was a darned blackguard and his name aint
mentioned in this house Thats all I can tell you and you mustnt ask
any more questions Why if your Uncle Zoethyes or your Uncle Shad
eitherwas to hear you askin about himtheydI dont know what
theyd do Im goin to tear this thing up

He would have torn the photograph across but the girl seized his hands

Oh no you mustnt she cried Please dont It isnt mine It
belongs to Uncle Shad You mustnt tear itgive it to me

Isaiah hesitated Give it to you he repeated Whatll you do with
it

Ill put it right back where I found it Truly I will I will honest
Mr Chase

Isaiah reflected Then and with considerable reluctance he handed her
the photograph

All right he said only be sure you do it And look here
MaryGusta dont you ever touch it again and dont you ever tell
either of your uncles or anybody else that you found it You hear

MaryGusta said that she heard She ran to the garret and replaced the
photograph in the pocket of the trunk She did not mention it again nor
did Isaiah but thereafter when her active imagination constructed a
life romance with Mr Zoeth Hamilton as its hero that romance contained
a villain also and the villains name was Edgar S Farmer And the firm
of Hall and Company her fathers firm had a fourth and most mysterious
partner who was a blackguard




CHAPTER VIII


The summers and winters came and went and MaryGustas birthdays
came and went with them She grew taller and more mature Her place as
assistant housekeeper was recognized now and even Isaiah consulted her
on matters of household management As for her uncles she managed them
whether consulted or not They took the place of the discarded dolls
she was too old for dolls now although David was still mothered and
petted as much as ever But when Uncle Zoeth had a cold it was she who
insisted upon his wrapping up and saw that the wraps were ready and if
Uncle Shad was caught wearing socks with holes in them he was scolded
and supplied with fresh ones She selected the clothes they should wear
and insisted that they black their boots on Sunday She helped them in
the store and it became occasionally possible for them to leave that
place of business at the same time without engaging the services of
Annabel At first the partners Captain Shadrach especially protested
against the supervision and the innovations but MaryGusta tactfully
and diplomatically carried each point and after a time the Captain
ceased to protest and accepted the inevitable almost with meekness

No use Zoeth he said on one occasion Ive talked and talked but
Im wearin the necktie just the same I told her twas too good to wear
weekdays and it ought to be saved for Sunday but it aint Sunday and
Ive got it on She said twas becomin and the one Ive been wearin
wasnt and that she crocheted it for me and I dont know what all So
here I am Got so I aint even boss of my own neck

Well tis becomin observed Zoeth And she did crochet it for you
I noticed you didnt stop her tyin it on you even while you was vowin
you wouldnt wear it

Shadrach sighed To think he groaned that I Capn Shad Gould a
man thats handled as many fomast hands as I have should come to be
led around by the nose by a slip of a girl By fire II cant hardly
believe it Its disgraceful

Zoeth smiled Oh be still Shadrach he said You bear up under the
disgrace as well as anybody ever I saw You know perfectly well you was
tickled to death to have her tie that necktie on you You was grinnin
like a Chessy cat all the time

I wasnt neither I was chokin not grinnin You dont know a grin
from a choke

Zoeth changed the subject Its a mighty pretty necktie he declared
There aint anybody in this town unless its Philander Bearses wife
that can crochet any bettern that girl of ours

Shadrach snorted What are you talkin about he demanded Etta
Bearse never saw the day she could crochet like that No nor do
anything else so well either Look at the way our candy trade has
picked up since MaryGusta fixed up the showcase You callated twas
all right the way twas afore and thought twas foolish to change but
she changed it andwell weve sold a third again as much candy

Zoeths smile broadened Seems as if I remember your sayin a few
things about that showcase he remarked You gave me fits for lettin
her fuss with it Annabel was in tother day and she said folks thought
twas queer enough our lettin a thirteenyearold child run our store
for us

She did eh Shes jealous thats what ails her And to think of HER
sayin it That Annabels all brass like a ships spyglass By the
jumpin Judas Im proud of that showcase and Im proud of MaryGusta
She dont make many mistakes I cant remember of her makin any

Neither can I not even in neckties There there Shadrach I know
you You talk about disgrace and such but youre as crazy about
MaryGusta asas

As you are eh Well maybe I am Zoeth When she was first willed to
us as you might say I used to wonder how wed ever get along with her
now I wonder how we got along without her If she should beertook
away from us I dont know

Sshh shh Shadrach Dont talk about anything like that

MaryGusta was making good progress at school At fourteen she
graduated from the grammar school and in the fall was to enter the
high school She was popular among her mates although she never sought
popularity

At picnics and church sociables she had always a small circle about
her and the South Harniss boys were prominent in that circle But
MaryGusta although she liked boys and girls well enough never showed
a liking for one more than the other and she was too busy at the house
and in the store to have her young friends hanging about They bothered
her she said As for having a particular friend of the other sex
which some of the girls in her class no older than she seemed to think
a necessary proof of being in their teens she laughed at the idea She
had her adopted uncles and Isaiah to take care of and boy beaux were
silly Talking about them as these girls did was sillier still

That summerthe summer preceding MaryGustas fifteenth birthdaywas
the liveliest South Harniss had known The village was beginning to feel
the first symptoms of its later boom as a summer resort A number of
cottages had been built for people from Boston and New York and Chicago
and there was talk of a new hotel Also there was talk of several new
stores but Hamilton and Company were inclined to believe this merely
talk and did not worry about it Their trade was unusually brisk and the
demand for MaryGustas services as salesgirl interfered considerably
with her duties as assistant housekeeper

One fine clear July morning she came up to the store early in order
that the partners might go down to the house for breakfast They had
gone and she had just finished placing on the counters and in other
likely spots about the store sheets of sticky fly paper Flies are a
nuisance in South Harniss in midsummer and Captain Shad detested them
Just as the last sheet was laid in place a young fellow and a girl
came in MaryGusta recognized them both The girl was the
seventeenyearold daughter of a wealthy summer resident a Mr Keith
from Chicago The Keiths had a fine cottage on the bluff at the other
end of the village The young chap with her was so gossip reported
a college friend of her brother His surname was prosaic enough being
Smith but his first name was Crawford and his home was somewhere in the
Far West He was big and goodlooking and the Boston papers mentioned
him as one of the most promising backs on the Harvard Freshman eleven
Next year so the sporting writers opined he would almost certainly
make the Varsity team Most of MaryGustas feminine friends and
acquaintances rated him perfectly splendid and regarded Edna Keith
with envious eyes

This morning both he and the Keith girl were arrayed in the gayest of
summer regalia Young Smiths white flannel trousers were carefully
creased his blue serge coat was without a wrinkle his tie and socks
were a perfect match and his cap was of a style which the youth of
South Harniss might be wearing the following summer but not this one
Take him by and large as Captain Shadrach would have said Crawford
Smith was an immaculate and beautiful exhibit of which fact he being
eighteen years of age was doubtless quite aware

He and the Keith girl were so MaryGusta learned a committee of two
selected to purchase certain supplies for a beach picnic a combination
clambake and marshmallow toast which was to take place over at Setuckit
Point that day Sam Keith Ednas brother and the other members of the
party had gone on to Jabez Hedges residence where Jabez had promised
to meet them with the clams and other things for the bake Edna and her
escort having made their purchases at Hamilton and Companys were to
join them at the clammans Then the whole party was to go down to
the wharf and the sailboat

Miss Edna who was a talkative damsel informed MaryGusta of these
facts at once Also she announced that they must hurry like everything

You see she said we told Sam and the rest wed be at the clammans
in ten minutes and if were not there Sam will be awfully cross He
hates to wait for people And weve been too long already Its all your
fault Crawford you would stop to hear that fruit man talk I told you
you mustnt

The fruit man was Mr Gaius Small and although he stammered
he loved the sound of his own voice The demand for a dozen oranges
furnished Gaius with subject sufficient for a lengthy monologueforty
drawls and ten stutters to every orange quoting Captain Shad again

I told you you mustnt get him started went on Miss Keith gushingly
Hell talk forever if he has a chance But you would do it Asking him
if he kept pomegranates and breadfruit The idea Im sure he doesnt
know what a pomegranate is You were SO solemn and he was SO ridiculous
I thought I should DIE You really are the drollest person Crawford
Smith I dont know what I shall do with you

It was evident that her opinion of young Smith was not different from
that of other young ladies of her age Also that Crawford himself was
not entirely unconscious of that opinion At eighteen to be set upon
a pedestal and worshiped to have ones feeblest joke hailed as a
masterpiece of wit is dangerous for the idol the effort of sustaining
the elevated position entails the risk of a fall Crawford was but
eighteen and a good fellow but he had been worshiped a good deal He
was quite as sensible as other young chaps of his age which statement
means exactly that and no more

Well he said with a complacent grin we learned how to pronounce
pomegranate at any rate You begin with a puppuppup as if you were
calling a dog and you finish with a grunt like a pig I wish I had
asked him for a persimmon then hed have made a noise like a cat

Miss Keith when she recovered from her spasm of merriment declared her
companion perfectly killing

But we must hurry she said We really must Crawford you buy the
things I should think of that fruit man and laugh all the time I know
I should

She remained by the door and the young gentleman strolled to the
counter He cast an amused glance about the store its display of stock
was thanks to MaryGustas recent efforts at tidiness not quite the
conglomerate mass it had been when the partners were solely responsible
but the variety was still strikingly obvious

Humph observed Crawford Ive forgotten what we came to buy but Im
sure it is here whatever it is Some emporium this Introduce me to
the proprietor will you Edna

Edna giggled

She isnt the proprietor she said She is just the clerk thats
all Her name isIve forgotten your name dear What is it

Mary Lathrop replied MaryGusta shortly She objected to being
addressed as dear and she strongly objected to the patronizing tone in
which it was uttered Edna Keith was older than she but not old enough
to patronize

Oh yes so it is said the young lady But that isnt what everyone
calls you They call you something elsesomething funnyOh I know
MaryGusta thats it I knew it was funny MaryGusta this is Mr
Smith He wants to buy some things And hes in a GREAT hurry

Charmed MaryGusta said Mr Smith MaryGusta did not appear
charmed She asked him what he wanted

Search ME said the young gentleman cheerfully There was a list
wasnt there Edna You have it I think

Edna produced the list scrawled in pencil on the back of an envelope
Crawford looked it over

Sams writing isnt exactly print he observed but I can guess at
it Lets seea pound of butter Wheres the butter department of this
Bon Marche Edna

Edna after another convulsion declared she didnt know

No doubt MisserMary Jane knows went on her companion Why
yes of course she does Right there behind the oilskin jacket Remove
jacket open doorbehold the icebox and the butter Neat compact and
convenient One pound only Elizabeth Eliza Thank you

Her name isnt Elizabeth Eliza giggled Miss Keith Isnt he awful
MaryGusta You mustnt mind him

I dont said MaryGusta promptly What else do you want

Crawford consulted the list The next item he said appears to be
aercertain kind of ham I blush to mention it but I must It is
deviled ham Have you that kind of ham MaryGusta

MaryGusta took the can of deviled ham from the shelf Crawford shook
his head

To think that one so young should be so familiar with ham of that
kind he said She didnt speak its name though Suppose I had asked
you what kind of ham you had MisserGusta how would you have got
around it

MaryGusta did not answer She was very angry but she was determined
that her tormentor should not know it

A young lady of few words commented Mr Smith Next item appears to
be six boxes of marshmallows Where is the marshmallow department Mary
Jane

MaryGusta hesitated The tin boxes of marshmallows were on the
shelf behind the counter under the candy case But there was a fresh
assortment in an unopened packing box in the back room a box which had
just come from the wholesale confectioners in Boston Her Uncle Zoeth
had expressed a fear that those beneath the counter were rather stale

Miss Keith fidgeted Oh dear she exclaimed This is SO slow I know
Sam and the rest wont wait for us at the clammans much longer

Her companion whistled Is the word hurry in the South Harniss
dictionary Edna he inquired How about it Mary Jane

MaryGusta was determined not to hurry This superior young man wished
her to do so and that was reason sufficient for delay

Young Smith sighed resignedly Edna he said suppose we sit down
The word is NOT in the dictionary

There was but one chair except those behind the counters in the store
Miss Keith took that with an exclamation of impatience Crawford Smith
whistling a mournful dirge sauntered to the end of the counter and sat
down upon a nail keg

MaryGusta also uttered an exclamation It is well to look before one
leaps also occasionally before one sits That keg had spread across
its top a sheet of the fresh and very sticky fly paper Before she
could have protested even if she had wished to do so the young
gentlemans spotless white flannels and the fly paper came in contact
close and clinging contact

MaryGusta put a hand to her mouth Crawford looked at her caught the
direction of her look and looked in that direction himself His whistle
stopped in the middle of a note and his face immediately became a match
for his socks and tie a beautiful rich crimson the chosen color of his
University

Miss Keith from her seat by the door could not see beyond the end of
the counter Consequently she was unaware of the mishap to the white
flannels But MaryGusta saw and knew also she could see that Mr
Smith knew

Oh dear exclaimed Edna impatiently We are dreadfully late now
Well never get there on time Sam wont wait for us I know he wont
Where are those marshmallows Cant you please hurry MaryGusta

MaryGustas eyes were sparkling Her manner was provokingly
deliberate She took a box of marshmallows from beneath the counter

There are some here she said but Im afraid they arent very fresh
The fresh ones those that have just come are in a box in the back
room That box hasnt been opened yet If you can wait Ill open it for
you

Young Smith said nothing Miss Keith however spoke her mind

Of course we cant wait she declared Im sure these will do They
will do wont they Crawford

And still Crawford remained silent MaryGusta who was enjoying this
portion of the interview as much as she had disliked its beginning
offered a suggestion

If you will just come here and look at these she said with
mischievous gravity addressing the young gentleman on the nail keg
perhaps you can tell whether theyre fresh enough

The young gentleman did not rise His face retained its brilliant color
and his lips moved but his answer was not audible At his age the dread
of appearing ridiculous especially in the presence of a youthful and
charming female is above all others hateful And Edna Keith was not the
only girl in the picnic party there were others She would be certain
to tell them Crawford Smith foresaw a horrible day a day of disgrace
and humiliation one in which he was destined to furnish amusement
without sharing the fun And Sam Keith who had remarked upon the
splendor of his friends attire would gloatnot only here in South
Harniss but elsewherein Cambridge for instance An older man would
have risen laughed whether he felt like laughing or notand have
expressed his opinion of fly paper Crawford was not yet a man he was
in the transition stage a boy fondly hoping that other people might
think him a man So he sat still until it was too late to rise and then
wished he had risen in the first place

My goodness exclaimed the fidgety Miss Keith why dont you look at
them Crawford What are you waiting for

MaryGusta the box of marshmallows in her hand regarded the boy on
the nail keg His eyes met hers and in them was a look of such utter
misery that the girl relented Her feeling of satisfied resentment
changed to one almost of pity She had been made to feel ridiculous
herself at various times in her short life and she remembered the
sensation MaryGusta as has been mentioned before in this history
was old for her years

She considered a moment Then she thrust the box beneath the counter

I guess Id better not sell you those anyway she said with decision
Uncle Zoeth said they werent fresh Ill open the case in the back
room

Edna stamped her foot

We cant wait for that she declared We must go without them
I suppose Oh dear And they depended on us to get them Its so
provoking Now we cant have any toast at all and it would have been
such fun

MaryGusta glanced once more at the occupant of the keg

I was thinking she said slowly that you neednt both wait unless
you wanted to Perhaps Miss Keith might go on and tell the others
anderMr Smith could stay here until I opened the box Then he could
meet you at the boat

Edna hesitated Shall I Crawford she asked

Her companion did not hesitate I think perhaps youd better Edna he
said II guess I wont be long

Miss Keith hurried out MaryGusta turned her attention to the
remaining visitor

You can get up now she said Some of it will tear off anyway
and if you hurry you will have time to run home and change youryour
clothes

Crawford was evidently much surprised also his embarrassment was not
lessened but he rose

Thenthen you knew he stammered

Of course I knew I saw you sit down on it didnt I If Id known what
you were going to do Id have told you to look out But you did it so
quick I couldnt Now tear off as much as you can

The young gentleman obeyed orders Does it show much he queried I
cant see Is there much left

MaryGusta smiled His contortions were as violent as they were vain
Theres enough she said simply Here are the things you bought Now
go out of the back door and cut across the fields Its the shortest way
home

Mr Smith took his various parcels including the six boxes of
marshmallows which MaryGusta produced from beneath the counter I
thought you said these were stale he observed wonderingly

I said they werent real fresh but theyre fresh enough for a toast
I said that so that the Keith girl wouldnt wait I didnt think you
wanted her to

You bet your life I didnt So thats why you said you would have to
open the other box Justjust to help me out

Yes Now dont stop any longer Youll have to run you know Go out
the back way

Crawford started for the door of the back room but at that door he
paused

Say he said feelingly this is mighty white of you do you know it
And after the way I guyed you when I first came in I guess I was rather
fresh wasnt I

Yes you were

Yes yes I guess I was I thought you were just a country kid you
know and Isay by George you WERE white If Id been you Id have
got square You had the chance twould have served me right for playing
the smart Aleck I beg your pardon Youre all RIGHT And Im awfully
sorry I was such a chump

It was a straightforward honest apology and confession of fault
MaryGusta was pleased but she did not show it He had referred to her
as a kid and she did not like that

If you dont hurryyes and run like everything she said you wont
have time to get home and change and meet the others at the boat And
somebody else will see you too Youd better go

The young man went without further delay MaryGusta watching from the
back door saw him racing across the fields in the direction of the Keith
cottage When her uncles returned she said nothing of the occurrence
She considered it funny but she knew Crawford Smith did not and she
was sure he would prefer to have the secret kept

The following afternoon the partners of Hamilton and Company entertained
a caller at the store That evening Shadrach spoke of the call to
MaryGusta

That young Smith feller thats been visitin the Keiths was in today
said the Captain Didnt want to buy nothin said he just happened
in thats all Asked where you was he did I didnt know he knew you
MaryGusta

MaryGusta who was busy clearing the supper table answered without
looking round He and Edna Keith bought some things at the store
yesterday she said

Yes so he said He said tell you everything was all right and he had
a fine time at the picnic Seemed to callate you was a pretty bright
girl We knew that afore of course but it was nice of him to say so
Hes leavin on tomorrow mornins train Goin way out West he is to
Nevada thats where he and his dad live His mas dead so he told us
Must be tough to live so fur off from salt water I couldnt stand it
I know that Funny thing about that young feller too his face looked
sort of familiar to me and Zoeth Seemed as if he looked like somebody
we knew but of course we didnt know any of his folks we dont know
any Smiths from way off there

The subject was dropped for the time but two days later the expressman
brought a package to the house The package was addressed to Miss
Mary Augusta Lathrop and contained a fivepound basket of expensive
chocolates and bonbons There was a note with it which read as follows


Hope youll like these They are fresh at least Huylers people swear
they are but I dont believe they are as good as those marshmallows
And I KNOW they are not as fresh as a certain person was at a certain
time Please eat them and forget the other freshness

C S

You were a perfect little brick not to tell


MaryGusta was obliged to tell then but she made her uncles and Isaiah
promise not to do so She with the able assistance of the other members
of the household ate the contents of the basket in due time The basket
itself was taken to the parlor where it was given a place beside the
other curiosities As for the note that disappeared And yet if one
had investigated the contents of the small drawer of MaryGustas
bureau where she kept her most intimate treasures the mystery of its
disappearance might have been solved

It was the only epistle of its kind the girl had yet received and
after all goodlooking young college men are what they are And
MaryGusta in spite of her queerness was feminineand human




CHAPTER IX


When MaryGusta was seventeen a great event took place The happening
which led to it was trivial enough but the results were important and
farreaching They led to the second great change in her life a change
as important as that brought about by her memorable visit to South
Harniss

She was a girl in years still but tall for her age and in thought and
manner almost a young woman Her management of her uncles and Isaiah was
now complete They no longer protested even to each other against the
management and in fact gloried in it The cook and steward accepted
her orders concerning the daily marketing and he and she audited the
monthly bills The white house by the shore was a different place
altogether now and chickenpox tablecloths and tarnished silver were
things of the forgotten past At the store she had become almost a
silent partner and Hamilton and Companys emporium was thanks to her
judgment and tact if not yet an uptodate establishment at least a
shop where commodities to be sold were in places where they might be
seen by prospective purchasers and readily located by the proprietors

She spent a good deal of her time except in school hours at the store
and much of the buying as well as the selling was done by her The
drummers representing New York and Boston wholesale houses knew her and
cherished keen respect for her abilities as a selector and purchaser of
goods

Say said one of these gentlemen after a lengthy session during
which his attempts to work off several stickers had been frustrated by
MaryGustas common sense and discernmentSay that girl of yours is
a wonder do you know it Shes the sharpest buyer I ever run across on
my trips down here I dont take a back seat for anybody when it comes
to selling goods and theres mighty little I cant sell but I cant
bluff her She knows whats what you hear me

Shadrach to whom this remark was made chuckled You bet you he
declared with enthusiasm Anybody that gets ahead of our MaryGusta
has got to turn out afore the mornin watch Shes smart Zoeth and me
aint aboard the same craft with her

I should say not And you cant get gay with her either Most girls of
her age and as good a looker as she is dont object to a little ragging
theyre used to it and they like itbut not her She isnt fishing for
boxes of candy or invitations to dances That line of talk means goodby
and no sale where she is Business and just business thats all there
is to her How long are you goin to keep her here

How long Why forever I hope What are you talkin about

The drummer winked Thats all right he observed You want to keep
her I dont doubt but one of these days somebody elsell be wanting
her more than you do Mr Rightll be coming along here some time and
thengood night Shes young yet but in a couple of years shell be a
queen and thenwell then maybe Ill stand a better chance of unloading
those last summer caps the house has got in stock Girls like her dont
stay single and keep store theres too much demand and not enough
competition Gad If I wasnt an antique and married already I dont
know but Id be getting into line Thats what

Captain Shadrach was inclined to be angry but although he would
not have admitted it he realized the truth of this frank statement
MaryGusta was pretty she was more than that and the line was already
forming Jimmie Bacheldor had long ago ceased to be a competitor that
friendship had ended abruptly at the time of Davids narrow escape but
there were others plenty of them Daniel Higgins son of Mr Solomon
Higgins the local lumber dealer and undertaker was severely smitten
Dan was at work in Boston where he was engaged in the cheerful and
remunerative business of selling coffins for the American Casket
Company He was diligent and active and his future promised to be
bright at least so his proud father boasted He came home for holidays
and vacations and his raiment was anything but funereal but MaryGusta
was not impressed either by the raiment or the personality beneath it
She treated the persistent Daniel as a boy and a former schoolmate
When he assumed manly airs she laughed at him and when he invited her to
accompany him to the Cattle Show at Ostable she refused and said she was
going with Uncle Zoeth

Dan Higgins was not the only young fellow who found the store of
Hamilton and Company an attractive lounging place Some of the young
gentlemen not permanent residents of South Harniss also appeared to
consider it a pleasant place to visit on Summer afternoons They came to
buy of course but they remained to chat MaryGusta might have sailed
or picknicked a good deal and in the best of company socially speaking
if she had cared to do so She did not so care

They dont want me Uncle Shad she said And I dont want to go

Course they want you declared Shadrach stoutly If they didnt want
you they wouldnt ask you taint likely And I heard that young Keith
feller askin you to go out sailin with him this very afternoon

You didnt hear his sister ask me did you There there Uncle Shad
dont worry about me Im having a good time a very much better time
than if I went sailing with the Keiths

Whats the matter with the Keiths Theyre as nice folks as come to
South Harniss

Of course they are

Well then And youre as good as they are aint you

I hope so Uncle Shad why dont you wear a white flannel suit in hot
weather Mr Keith Sams father wore one at the church garden party
the other day

The Captain stared at her Why dont I wearwhat he stammered

A white flannel suit Youre as good as Mr Keith arent you

I guess I am I dont know why I aint But what kind of a questions
that Id look like a plain fool tagged out in one of them things
anyway Id feel like one I dont belong in a white flannel suit I
aint no imitation dude

And I dont belong in Sam Keiths yacht At least Mr Keith and Edna
would feel that I didnt I dont want to be considered an imitation
either

Shadrach shook his head You aint like anybody else he said Youre
a funny girl MaryGusta

I suppose I am but Im not as funny as I should be if I tried to BE
somebody else No Uncle Shad youll just have to bear with me as I am
funniness and all

A few days after this Keith senior came into the store He was not
arrayed in the white flannels but was wearing a rather shabby but very
comfortable tweed jacket and trousers and a white canvas hat of the kind
which Hamilton and Company sold for fifty cents His shirt was of the
softcollared variety and his shoes were what South Harniss called
sneakers

John Keiths visits to Cape Cod were neither very frequent nor lengthy
His wife and family came in June and remained until late September but
his sojourns were seldom longer than a week at a time and there were
intervals of a month or more between them In Chicago he was the head
of a large business and that business demanded close attention When he
left it he left his cares with it and enjoyed himself in his own way
That way included old clothes golf a boat and just as few tea and
garden parties as his wife would permit

He was planning a fishing trip and had stopped at the store to buy
some tobacco The partners had gone home for dinner and MaryGusta
was tending shop At that moment she was busy with the traveling
representative of Messrs Bernstein Goldberg and Baun of Providence
wholesale dealers in stationery cards and novelties The time was
August but Mr Kron the drummer was already booking orders for the
Christmas season His samples were displayed upon the counter and he and
MaryGusta were deep in conversation

Thats what you ought to have declared Mr Kron with enthusiasm
Believe me theres goin to be some call for that line of stuff this
year The house cant turn em out fast enough

But what is it asked MaryGusta Whats it for

Its a combination calendar and beautybox explained Mr Kron Hang
it on the wall by your bureausee In the mornin you cant remember
what day it is All right theres the calendar Then you want to doll
yourself up forwell for the party youre goin to

The same morning interrupted MaryGusta

Mr Kron grinned He was a young man and this was his first trip in that
section His clothes were neither modest nor retiring and he himself
did not suffer from these failings Also he prided himself on having a
way with the ladies especially the younger ladies And MaryGusta was
distinctly the most attractive young person he had met on this trip

He laughed in appreciation of the joke

Say he observed admiringly youre up to the minute aint you
Youre some kidder all right Are there many more in this burg like
you If there are Im goin to move in and settle down What

MaryGusta did not laugh nor did she answer Instead she turned to
the gentleman who had entered the store

Good morning Mr Keith she said Was there anything you wanted

Keith smiled No hurry he said Ive got a little time to kill and
if you dont mind Ill kill it here Ill sit down and wait if I may
That boatman of mine will be along pretty soon

He took the chair by the door Mr Kron continued his exploitation of
the combination calendar and beautybox

You are goin to a party he went on either that night or that
afternoon or sometime Sure you are Girls like you aint handed the
goby on many parties in this neck of the woodsam I right Well then
when the time comes you pull down the flap Theres your beautybox
lookinglass powder puff and powder all complete Now a novelty like
that will sell

We couldnt use it interrupted MaryGusta Show me something else

Mr Kron disappointed but far from discouraged showed her something
elsemany somethings Concerning each he was enthusiastic slangy and
familiar MaryGusta paid little attention to slang or enthusiasm the
familiarity she ignored utterly She selected several of the novelties
a rather extensive line of Christmas cards and in the matters of
price and cash discounts was keen and businesslike Keith watched and
listened at first with amusement then with growing admiration for the
girls simplicity and good sense

Mr Krons admiration was outspoken

Say he said as he repacked his samples youre a mighty clever
buyer do you know it That line of stuff youve ordered is the cream
thats what it is You made a mistake in not layin in a dozen or two of
those combination beautyboxes but thats all right Here have one for
yourself Take it with my compliments

MaryGusta declined No thank you she said

Why not It dont come out of my pocket The firm expects me to hand
out little keepsakes like that Ive been plantin em with the girls
all the way down

No thank you she replied

Mr Kron having finished his business as representative of Messrs
Bernstein Goldberg and Baun attempted a stroke of his own

Say he said Ive got a little spare time on my hands this evenin
I shant make the next town until tomorrow Theres a new movie theater
just opened over to Orham They tell me its all to the mustard I can
hire a rig here and you and me might drive over tonight and take it in
What do you say Kid

No thank you said MaryGusta again

But

No thank you Good day

She turned away to enter the order she had just given in a book on
the desk Mr Kron tried again but she did not appear to hear him He
grinned observed Oh very well and with a wink at Mr Keith went
out a suitcase in each hand

Keith rose from the chair and walking over to the counter requested to
be supplied with the tobacco he had come to buy MaryGusta gave it
to him Her cheeks were red and Keith was surprised to notice that she
looked almost as if she would like to cry He guessed the reason

That young man will get himself thoroughly kicked some day he
observed Im not sure that I oughtnt to have done it myself just now
He annoyed you Im afraid

MaryGusta answered without looking at him

Thats all right she said Im foolish I guess He meant to be
nice perhaps Some girls may like that sort of niceness I dont

Why didnt you tell him to get out

I wanted to see his samples It is time for us to buy our Christmas
things and I had rather choose them myself thats all

Oh But Mr Hamilton or the CaptainI should think

Oh they might have bought some that we couldnt sell

The beautyboxes for instance

MaryGusta smiled Why yes she admitted perhaps

I see But it was rather an ordeal for you Do you have to endure much
of that sort of thing

No more than any girl who keeps store I guess

At the dinner table that evening Keith referred to his experience as
listener in Hamilton and Companys shop

That girl with the queer name he said a niece of those two old
chaps who run the place I believe she is Do you know anything about
her Gertrude

Before Mrs Keith could reply Edna spoke

Ask Sam Dad she said mischievously Sam knows about her He just
adores that store he spends half his time there

Nonsense Edna protested Sam turning red I dont do any such
thing

Oh yes you do And you know about MaryGusta too He says shes a
peach Daddy

Humph grunted her brother indignantly Well she is one Shes
got every girl in your set skinned a mile for looks But I dont know
anything about her of course

Mrs Keith broke in Skinned a mile she repeated with a shudder
Sam what language you do use Yes John she added addressing her
husband I know the girl well Shes pretty and she is sensible For
a girl who has had no opportunities and has lived all her life here in
South Harniss she is really quite remarkable Why do you speak of her
John

Mr Keith related a part of the conversation between MaryGusta and Mr
Kron

She handled the fellow splendidly he said She talked business with
him and she wouldnt let him talk anything else But it was plain enough
to see that she felt insulted and angry It seems a pity that a girl
like that should have to put up with that sort of thing I wonder if her
uncles old Mr Hamilton and Captain Shadrach realize what happens when
theyre not about How would they take it do you think if I dropped a
hint

Edna laughed You would have to be very careful Daddy she said Mr
Hamilton and the Captain idolize MaryGusta and she just worships them
Besides she isnt really their niece you know She is a young lady of
independent meansat least so everybody says

Her father was surprised He asked what she meant by independent
means Mrs Keith answered

The means are not very extensive I imagine she said The story is
that this MaryGustawhy they persist in calling her by that dreadful
name I cant understandis the daughter of a former friend and partner
Mr Hamilton and Captain Gould adopted her and she has lived with them
ever since She has money of her own though no two of the townspeople
agree as to how much Ive heard it estimated all the way from five to
fifty thousand She never speaks of it and those queer old uncles of
hers keep their affairs very much to themselves But I agree with you
John it is a shame that she should have to spend her life here in South
Harniss I think we ought to do something for her if we can I shall
think it over

Mrs Keith was always doing something for somebody At home in Chicago
she was president of her womens club and identified with goodness knows
how many charitable societies In South Harniss she was active in church
and sewing circles Her enthusiasm was always great but her tact was
sometimes lacking South Harniss people some of them were inclined
to consider her as a selfappointed boss interfering where she had no
business

Her husband looked a trifle dubious

Be careful Gertrude he cautioned Look out you dont offend
These Cape Codders are selfrespecting and touchy you know Anyone
interfering with their private affairs is likely to get into trouble

His wife resented the warning Dont throw cold water on everything
John she said I know more about Cape Codders than you do You only
meet them for a few weeks each summer I flatter myself that I know them
and that they know and trust me Of COURSE I shall be careful And I
shall think the MaryGusta matter over

She did think it over and a week later she came to her husband
overflowing with the excitement of a brilliant idea A cousin of hers
a maiden lady of sixty or thereabouts wealthy and a semiinvalid who
cherished her illhealth was in need of a female companion Mrs Keith
was certain that MaryGusta would be just the person to fill that need

Mr Keith was by no means so certain He raised some objections

Humph he said Well Gertrude to be frank I dont think much
of the scheme Cousin Clara has had one companion after the other for
thirty years None of them has stayed with her very long She requires
a sort of combination friend and ladys maid and secretary and waitress
and I dont think our MaryGusta would enjoy that sort of job I
certainly shouldntwith Clara

His wife was indignant I might have known you would be ready with the
cold water she declared Clara iswell cranky and particular and
all that but the opportunity is wonderful The girl would travel and
meet the best people

She might remove their wraps I admit

Nonsense And if Clara took a fancy to her she might leave her a good
sum of money when she died

Perhaps providing the girl didnt die first No Gertrude Im
sorry to disappoint you but I dont think much of your idea Anyway
according to my belief youre approaching this thing from the wrong
end It isnt the girl herself you should try to influence but her
uncles or guardians or whatever they are If I know her and Ive been
making some inquiries she wont leave them She will consider that they
need her at the house and store and shell stay They are the ones to
influence If the matter of her welfare and future was put to them in
the right light they mightwell they might sacrifice themselves to
benefit her

Rubbish I know Im right Shell jump at the opportunity I shall tell
her about it this very afternoon

She wont accept Ill bet on it

His principal reason for nonbelief in MaryGustas acceptance was his
knowledge of his wifes lack of tact The girl did not consider herself
nor was she a subject of charity And the position of combination
friend and servant would not appeal to her John Keith had an idea of
his own concerning MaryGusta but it could wait until his wifes had
failed


It failed of course and Mrs Keith that evening was indignant and
angry

I never was so treated in my life she declared That girl didnt
know her place at all Im through I wash my hands of the whole
matter

Wasnt she polite inquired Keith

Oh she was polite enough as far as that goes but she wouldnt even
consider my proposal Wouldnt even hear me through She said she had no
thought of leaving South Harniss She was quite satisfied and contented
where she was One would think I had come to ask a favor instead of
conferring one Why she seemed to think my plan almost ridiculous

Did she say so

No of course she didnt She thanked me and all that but she snubbed
me just the same Im disgusted Im throughabsolutely and completely
through trying to help that girl

Keith did not say I told you so in fact he said little or nothing
more at the time But a day or two afterwards he called at the store
Zoeth and Captain Shadrach were alone there their niece having gone
down to the house a fact of which the caller was aware

The partners liked John Keith They considered him as Captain Shad
said a firstrate everyday sort of feller who did not patronize nor
put on airs even though he was a summer man and rich When he talked
with them it was of things they understood local affairs the cranberry
crop fishing and the doings of the Board of Selectmen He was willing
to listen as well as talk and he did not refer to permanent residents as
natives a habit of his wifes which irritated the Captain extremely

Jumpin fire said the latter on one occasion every time that woman
calls us town folks natives I feel as if she callated I lived up a
tree and chucked coconuts at folks I dont wonder some of the South Sea
Islands heathen eat missionaries If I ATE that woman she might agree
with me she dont as tis Every time I say yes she says no and that
makes me think yes hardern ever

So Mrs Keith was not popular with the South Harniss natives perhaps
because she tried so hard to be her husband who apparently did not try
to be was He and his opinions were liked and respected When he came
into the store therefore on this occasion Zoeth and Shad welcomed
him asked him to sit down and the conversation began with the
astonishing rise in the price of seafront property and drifted from
that to other timely and general topics

Just how it drifted to MaryGusta and her future neither of the
partners could have toldhowever drift there it did and they found
themselves chanting her praises to their caller who seemed much
interested

She is a remarkably capable girl observed Mr Keith And before we
realize it she will be a young woman Are you planning that she shall
keep store and keep house for you the rest of her life or the rest of
yours

Zoeth shook his head Why he said mildly I dont knows weve
planned much about it so fur Those things sort of take care of
themselves always seemed to me Or the Almighty takes care of em for
us

Their visitor smiled Someone else will be willing and anxious to take
care of her before many years or I miss my guess he said She is
likely to marry you know There must be some promising young fellows
down here

Shadrach sniffed It was a subject he never discussed with his partner
and did not like even to think about The remark of the hat and cap
drummer concerning the coming of a Mr Right had troubled him not a
little

Ugh he grunted theres promisin ones enough Most of those that
are contented to stay here in South Harniss are nothin BUT promise
they aint so strong on makin good Taint like twas when Zoeth and
me were young ourselves Now all the smart ambitious boys go up to the
city to work

Some of the girls go up there too dont they To school or college
Didnt I hear that Christopher Mullets daughter was at school in
Bridgewater

Ugh grunted Shadrach again I callate you did hear If you didnt
youre the only one in town that aint Becky Mulletyes and Chris
tooaint done anything but brag about their Irenes goin off to what
they call finishin school Judas I see HER finish She aint gotI
swan that girl aint got anything in her head but gas and every time
she opens her mouth she loses enough of that to keep a lighthouse lit up
all night

Shadrach murmured Zoeth dont say such unlikely things about folks
Be charitable as you can

Judas I amas much as I can If I wasnt charitable to that Mullet
girl Id be talkin yet I hove to afore Id got scarcely under way

Keith put in a word Finishing schools are not all bad by any means
he said There are various kinds and grades of course but a good
private school for girls is a fine thing It teaches them to meet and
judge people of all kinds and that fine feathers dont always make fine
birds Then too a girl at a good school of that sort is under strict
discipline and her acquaintances male acquaintances especially are
chosen with care Sixteen to eighteen is a dangerous age for the average
girl

By the way he added did your niece tell you of her experience with
that traveling salesman the other day the fellow selling Christmas
novelties No Well I happened to be here at the time It was rather
interesting

He told of MaryGustas session with Mr Kron The partners listened
with growing indignation

Well by the jumpin exclaimed Captain Shad Did you ever hear such
brassy talk in your life I wish to thunder Id been here Thered have
been one mighty sick patient ready for the doctor and he wouldnt have
been a South Harniss native either But MaryGusta didnt take none of
his sauce I tell you that girl of ours is all right

Yes she is all right But she didnt enjoy the experience that was
plain enough and so far as I can see she is likely to have a good
many others of the same kind Now it isnt my business I know that you
can tell me to shut up and clear out any time you like of course but
do you think it is just fair to a girl like your niece to condemn her
to a life of storekeeping or the alternative of marrying one of the
promising young men youve been talking about Dont you think such a
girl as she is deserves a chance every chance you can give her

The two partners stared at him openmouthed Shadrach as usual spoke
first

Condemn her he repeated Condemn MaryGusta A chance Why

Hush Shadrach interrupted Zoeth Mr Keith aint done yet Hes
goin to tell us what he means Go on Mr Keith what do you mean

Keith having broken the ice and found the water not so chilly as he
had feared it might be plunged in

Well I mean this he said I confess frankly that I have been very
favorably impressed by your niece She is an unusual girlunusually
pretty of course but much more than that She is simple and brave and
sensible and frank If she were my daughter I should be very proud of
her I know you are She should have it seems to me the opportunity to
make the most of her qualities and personality Ive been thinking about
her a great deal ever since my call at the store here the other day Now
Ive got a suggestion to make You can take it or leave it but I assure
you it is made with the best of intentions and solely in her interest as
I see it and I hope youll take it after youve thought it over Here
it is

He went on to impart the suggestion His hearers listened Zoeth
silently and Shadrach with occasional mutterings and exclamations

So there you are said Keith in conclusion The school is a good
one one of the best in Boston Two years there will do worlds for your
niece It has done worlds for other girls I have known It is rather
expensive of course but as I understand it Mary has money of her
own of which you as her guardians have charge She couldnt spend a
portion of that money to better advantage

Zoeth said nothing but he looked at the Captain and the Captain looked
at him

She HAS money of her own hasnt she inquired Mr Keith I have been
told she was left an independent fortune by her father

There was another interval of silence The partners were quite aware of
the general belief in MaryGustas independent fortune They had not
discouraged that belief It was no ones business but theirs and their
respect and affection for Marcellus Hall had prevented the disclosure of
the latters poverty That secret not even MaryGusta knew she too
believed that the money which paid for her clothes and board and all the
rest was her own Her uncles had helped her to think so

So when their visitor asked the pointed question Zoeth looked at
Shadrach and the latter shook his head

Yup he answered brusquely its true enough I callate Marcellus
left her all he had Butbut look here Mr Keith Do I understand you
to advise us to send MaryGusta awayto schoolfor two years Jumpin
fire Howhow could we Shewhy what would we do without her

It would be harder for you here in the store of course

The store Taint the store Im thinkin about its me and Zoeth
Whatll WE do without her Why shewhy no daughter could mean more to
us than that girl does and if Zoeth and me was her ownermother and
father we couldnt think more of her Wed be adrift and out of sight
of land if MaryGusta went away No no we couldnt think of such a
thing

Not even for her sake Shes worth a pretty big sacrifice a girl like
that

A long discussion followed a discussion interrupted by the arrival of
occasional customers but resumed as soon as each of these individuals
departed Zoeth asked a question

Thisthis MisserWhatshernames school youre talkin about he
asked a reglar boardin school is it

Yes but there are day pupils It was my idea provided you two were
willing to listen to my suggestion at all to suggest that Mary attend
as a day pupil She might live near the school instead of at it That
would be much less expensive

Umhm mused Shadrach butbut shed have to live somewheres and
I for one would want to be mighty particular what sort of a place she
lived at

Naturally Well I have thought of that too and here is suggestion
number three I have a cousina cousin of my first wifeswho lives on
Pinckney Street which is not far from the Misses Cabots school This
cousinMrs Wyeth is her nameis a widow and she hasnt too much
money She doesnt keep a boarding house exactly but she has been known
to take a few of what she calls paying guests Shes very Bostonian
and very particular concerning the references and family connections of
those guests but I think I could manage that If your niece were placed
in her care she would have a real home and meet only the sort of people
you would wish her to meet

He might have added that Mrs Wyeth being under many obligations
pecuniary and otherwise to her wealthy Chicago relative would need
only a hint from him to give MaryGusta the care and attention of a
parent a very particular Boston firstfamily parent But unlike his
present wife he was not in the habit of referring to his charities so
he kept this information to himself

Zoeth sighed I declare he said youre mighty kind in all this
Mr Keith I know that youre sartin this goin away to school would do
MaryGusta a sight of good Butbut I swan II cant hardly bear to
think of our lettin her go away from us

I dont wonder at that Just think it over and well have another talk
later




CHAPTER X


Mr Keith and the Captain had that later talkseveral talks in
factand a week after their first one Captain Shadrach suddenly
announced that he was callatin to run up to Boston just for a day on
business and that MaryGusta had better go along with him for company
Zoeth could tend store and get along all right until they returned The
girl was not so certain of the getting along all right but Mr Hamilton
as well as the Captain insisted so she consented at last The Boston
trip was not exactly a novelty to hershe had visited the city a number
of times during the past few yearsbut a holiday with Uncle Shad was
always good fun

They took the early morning train and reached Boston about ten oclock
Shadrachs business in the city seemed to be of a rather vague nature
this time They called at the offices of two or three of his old
friendsshipchandlers and marine outfitters on Commercial Street and
Atlantic Avenueand then the Captain looking at his watch announced
that it was pretty nigh noontime and he callated they had better
be cruisin up towards Pinckney Street Got an errand up in that
latitude he added

Pinckney Street was on the hill in the rear of the Common and the State
House and was narrow and crooked and oldfashioned

What in the world are we doing up here queried MaryGusta There
arent any wholesale houses here Im sure Havent you made a mistake
Uncle Shad Shadrach who had been consulting a page of his pocket
memorandum book replied that he callated hed got his bearins and
to the girls astonishment stopped before a brick dwelling with a
colonial doorway and a white stone step which actually shone from
scrubbing and rang the bell

The maid who answered the bell wore a white apron which crackled with
starch She looked as if she too had like the step been scrubbed a few
minutes before

This is No aint it inquired the Captain Humph I thought so
I aint so much of a wreck yet but that I can navigate Boston without a
pilot Is Mr Keith in

The maid who had received the pilot statement with uncomprehending
astonishment looked relieved

Yes sir she said Mr Keiths here Are you the ones hes
expectin Walk in please

They entered the house It was as spotlessly tidy within as without
The maid ushered them into a parlor where old mahogany and old family
portraits in oil were very much in evidence

Sit down please she said Ill tell Mr Keith youre here

She left the room MaryGusta turned to the Captain in amazed
agitation

Uncle Shad she demanded why on earth did you come HERE to see Mr
Keith Couldnt you have seen him at South Harniss

Shadrach shook his head Not today I couldnt he said Hes up here
today

But what do you want to see him for

Business business MaryGusta Mr Keith and me are tryin to do a
little stroke of business together Weve got a hen on as the feller
said Say this is kind of a swell house aint it And cleanmy soul
Judas did I move this chair out of place I didnt mean to Looks as if
it had set right in that one spot for a hundred years

Keith entered at that moment followed by an elderly lady whose gown was
almost as oldfashioned as the furniture She was a rather thin person
but her face although sharp was not unkind in expression and her
plainly arranged hair was white MaryGusta liked her looks she
guessed that she might be very nice indeed to people she knew and
fancied also that she would make certain of knowing them first

Hello Captain Gould hailed Keith Glad to see you Found the place
all right I see

Yesyes I found it Mr Keith

I thought you wouldnt have any difficulty Mary how do you do

MaryGusta and Mr Keith shook hands

Captain said Keith I want to introduce you to my cousin Mrs
Wyeth

Mrs Wyeth bowed with dignity

How do you do Captain Gould she said

Whywhy Im pretty smart thank you maam stammered Shadrach
rather embarrassed at all this ceremony Pleased to meet you maam

And this young lady went on Keith is Miss Mary Lathrop Miss
Lathrop this lady is Mrs Wyeth my cousin

MaryGusta with the uneasy feeling that Mrs Wyeths gaze had been
fixed upon her since she entered the room bowed but said nothing

And now said Mr Keith heartily well have luncheon Youre just
in time and Mrs Wyeth has been expecting you

The Captains embarrassment reached its height at this invitation

No no he stammered wewe cant do that Couldnt think of it
you know Wewe aint a mite hungry Had breakfast afore we left home
didnt we MaryGusta

Keith laughed Yes I know he said and you left home about
halfpast five Ive taken that early train myself If youre not hungry
you ought to be and luncheon is ready EmilyMrs Wyethhas been
expecting you She will be disappointed if you refuse

Mrs Wyeth herself put in a word here Of course they wont refuse
John she said with decision They must be famished Refuse The idea
Captain Gould Mr Keith will look out for you your niece will come
with me Luncheon will be ready in five minutes Come Mary Thats your
nameMaryisnt it Im glad to hear it Its plain and its sensible
and I like it The employment bureau sent me a maid a week ago and when
she told me her name I sent her back again It was Florina That was
enough Mercy All I could think of was a breakfast food Come Mary
Now John do be prompt

That luncheon took its place in MaryGustas memory beside that of her
first supper in the house at South Harniss They were both memorable
meals although alike in no other respects Mrs Wyeth presided of
course and she asked the blessing and poured the tea with dignity and
businesslike dispatch The cups and saucers were of thin transparent
China with pictures of mandarins and pagodas upon them They looked
oldfashioned and they were Mrs Wyeths grandfather had bought them
himself in Hongkong in the days when he commanded a clipper ship
and made voyages to the Far East The teaspoons were queer little
fiddlepatterned affairs they were made by an ancestor who was a
silversmith with a shop on Cornhill before General Gages army was
quartered in Boston And cups and spoons and napkins were so clean that
it seemed almost sacrilegious to soil them by use

Captain Shadrach did not soil his to any great extent at first The
Captain was plainly overawed by the genteel elegance of his surrounding
and the manner of his hostess But Mr Keith was very much at ease and
full of fun and after a time a little of Shadrachs selfconsciousness
disappeared When he learned that grandfather Wyeth had been a seafaring
man he came out of his shell sufficiently to narrate at Keiths
request one of his own experiences in Hongkong but even in the midst
of his yarn he never forgot to address his hostess as maam and he did
not say Jumpin Judas once

After luncheon Mr Keith and the Captain left the house together
Goin to attend to that little mite of business I spoke to you about
MaryGusta explained Shadrach confidentially Well be back pretty
soon I callate maybe youd better wait here that is with a glance
at Mrs Wyeth if itll be all right for you to

Of course it will be all right declared Mrs Wyeth promptly I shall
be glad to have her

Thank you maam If she wont be in the way I

If she were likely to be in the way I should say so She wont be

Yeseryes maam stammered Shadrach Thank you maam

When he and Mr Keith were out of the house he drew a long breath

Judas he observed feelingly Say that cousin of yours dont waste
any words does she When it comes to speakin whats in her mind she
dont fool around none Shes as right up and down as a schooners
fomast

Keith laughed heartily Emily is blunt and outspoken he said She
prides herself on that But she is as square as a brick She never says
one thing to your face and another behind your back

No II judge thats so Well thats all right I aint got any
objections to that way of talkin myself But say if every woman was
like her there wouldnt be many sewin circles would there The average
sewin circle meetin is one part sew and three parts what Soandso
said

When the little mite of business had been transacted and the pair
returned to the Wyeth house they found Mrs Wyeth and MaryGusta
awaiting them in the parlor The girl had the feeling that she had
been undergoing a rather vigorous crossexamination Mrs Wyeth had not
talked a great deal herself and her manner though brusque and matter
of fact was kind but she had asked questions about MaryGustas home
life about Captain Gould and Mr Hamilton about school and friends and
acquaintances And her comments when she made any were direct and to
the point

She and Mr Keith exchanged looks when the latter entered the room
Keith raised his eyebrows inquiringly She nodded as if giving emphatic
assent to his unspoken question

Shadrach and MaryGusta left the house soon afterward While the
Captain and Mr Keith were whispering together in the hall Mrs Wyeth
bade the girl goodby

I like you my dear said the lady You seem to be a sweet sensible
girl and I dont meet as many of that kind nowadays as I could wish I
am sure we shall be good friends

And WHAT did she mean by that demanded MaryGusta as she and the
Captain walked along Pinckney Street together Why should we be good
friends Probably Ill never meet her again

Shadrach smiled Oh you cant always tell he said Sometimes you
meet folks oftenern you think in this world

MaryGusta looked at him Uncle Shad she said what does all this
mean anyway Why did you go to her house And what was the mysterious
business of yours with Mr Keith

The Captain shook his head Weve got a hen on same as I told you
he declared When its time for the critter to come off the nest youll
see whats been hatched same as the rest of us Howd you like that Mrs
Wyeth Had a pretty sharp edge on her tongue didnt she

MaryGusta considered Yes she answered she was outspoken and
blunt of course But she is a ladya real lady I thinkand Im sure
I should like her very much when I knew her better I think though
that she would expect a person to behavebehave in her way I mean

Judas I should say so Dont talk I aint felt so much as if I was
keepin my toes on a chalk mark since I went to school I dont know
what her husband died of but Ill bet twasnt curvature of the spine
If he didnt stand up straight twasnt his wifes fault

MaryGustas curiosity concerning the mysterious business which had
brought them to the city became greater than ever before it was time to
take the train for home Apparently all of that business whatever it
might be had been transacted when her uncle and Mr Keith took their
short walk together after luncheon Captain Shadrach seemed to consider
his Boston errand done and the pair spent half of the hour before train
time wandering along Tremont and Washington Streets looking into shop
windows and the other half in the waiting room of the South Station

Great and growing as was her curiosity the girl asked no more
questions She was determined not to ask them And the Captain neither
while in the city nor during the homeward journey referred to the hen
in which he and his friend from Chicago were mutually interested It
was not until nine oclock that evening when supper was over and Zoeth
having locked up the store was with them in the sittingroom that the
hitherto secretive fowl came off the nest

Then Shadrach having given his partner a look and received one in
return cleared his throat and spoke

MaryGusta he said me and your Uncle Zoeth have got some news for
you I callate youve been wonderin a little mite what that business
of Mr Keiths and mine was aint you

MaryGusta smiled I have wonderedjust a little she observed with
mild sarcasm

Yesyes I aint surprised Well the business is done and its
settled and its about you

About me Why Uncle Shad How can it be about me

Cause it can and it is thats why MaryGusta me and Zoeth have
been thinkin about you a good deal lately and weve come to the
conclusion that we aint treated you just right

Havent treated me right YOU

Yes us Youre a good girl and a smart girlthe smartest and best
girl there is in this town A girl like that ought to do somethin
bettern than stay here in South Harniss and keep store Keepin stores
all right for old hulks like Zoeth Hamilton and Shad Gould but you
aint an old hulk youre a young craft right off the ways and you ought
to have a chance to cruise in the best water there is

Uncle Shad what are you talking about Cruise in the best water

Thats what I said You ought to mix with the best folks and get a fine
education and meet somebody besides drummers andand Sol Higginss son
Selling coffins may be a good job I dont say taint somebodys got
to do it and well all have to invest in that kind oferfurniture
sometime or nother And Dan Higgins is a good enough boy too But he
aint your kind

My kind Uncle Shad what in the world have I got to do with Dan
Higgins and coffinsand all the rest of it

Nothin nothin at all Thats what Im tryin to tell you if youll
give me a chance MaryGusta your Uncle Zoeth and I have decided that
you must go to school up to Boston at the Misses Cabots school there
Youll board along with that Mrs Wyeth the one we met today Shes
a good woman I callate though she is so everlastin straight up and
down Youll board there and youll go to school to those Cabot women
And

But MaryGusta interrupted The hen was off the nest now there was no
doubt of that and of all unexpected and impossible hatchings hers
was the most complete The absurdity of the idea to the girls mind
overshadowed even the surprise of it

What she said Uncle Shad what Do you mean that you and Uncle
Zoeth have been in conspiracy to send me away to school To send me away
to Boston

Shadrach nodded

No conspiracy about it he declared Me and Zoeth and Mr Keith
we

Mr Keith Yes yes I see It was Mr Keith who put the idea in your
head How perfectly silly

Silly Why is it silly

Because it is Its ridiculous

No it aint its common sense Other girls go to city finishin
schools dont they That Irene Mullets just gone for one Dont you
think we figger to do as much for our girl as Becky Mullet can do for
hers Jumpin fire If you aint worth a hogshead of girls like Irene
Mullet then I miss my guess

Hush Uncle Shad what difference does that make

And now Zoeth put in a word MaryGusta he said you know what a
good school like the one Shads been speakin of can do for a girl I
know you know it Now be right down honest wouldnt you like to have a
couple of years say at a school like that if you could have em just
as well as not Didnt you say not moren a fortnit ago that you was
glad Irene Mullet was goin to have such a chance to improve herself

MaryGusta had said that very thing she could not truthfully deny it

Of course I did she answered And I am glad But Irenes case and
mine are different Irene isnt needed at home I am and

Shadrach broke in Ah ha Ah ha Zoeth he crowed triumphantly
Didnt I tell you shed say that I knew shed say she wouldnt go
cause shed think shed ought to stay here and look out for us Well
MaryGusta you listen to me Zoeth and I are your guardians lawfully
appointed Were your bosses young lady for a spell yet And youre
goin to do as we say

But

There aint any buts The buts are all past and gone Mr Keith
has arranged for you to board and room along with Mrs Wyeth and Ive
arranged for your schoolin at the Cabot place Yes and Ive done
moren that I paid for your first years schoolin this very afternoon
So there THATS ended

It was not ended of course MaryGusta went to her room that night
declaring she would not leave her uncles to attend any finishing school
They went to theirs vowing that she should The real end came the next
day when Zoeth put the subject before her in a new light by saying

Look here MaryGusta just listen to me a minute and think Suppose
the boot was on tother foot suppose you wanted us to do somethin to
please you youd expect us to do it wouldnt you Anyhow you know
mighty well we WOULD do it Now we want you to do this to please us
Weve set our hearts on it

MaryGusta was silent for a minute or more The partners watched her
anxiously Then she asked an unusual question one concerning her own
financial status

Can I afford it she asked Have I money enough of my own

Zoeth looked troubled Shadrach however answered promptly and
diplomatically

Havent I told you he said that Zoeth and me are your guardians
And didnt I say wed gone into the thing careful and deliberate And
didnt I pay your first years schoolin yesterday Dont that alone
show what we think about the money Be still Zoeth thats enough
Well MaryGusta

MaryGusta considered a moment longer Then she rose and crossing the
room gave them each a kiss

Ill go she said simply Ill go because I think you mean it and
that it will please you For that reason and no other Ill go




CHAPTER XI


The Misses Cabots school was to open on the fifteenth of September and
on the morning of the fourteenth MaryGusta bade her guardians goodby
on the platform of the South Harniss railway station Shadrach had
intended going to Boston with her but she had firmly insisted on going
alone

I must get used to being away from you both she said and you must
get used to having me go It will be best for all of us to say goodby
here It wont be for VERY long Ill be home at Christmas you know

The three weeks prior to the fateful fourteenth had been crowded with
activities Twice the girl and Captain Shadrach had journeyed to Boston
where in company with Mrs Wyeth whose services had been volunteered
in a crisp but kindly note they visited shops and selected and
purchasedthat is the feminine members of the party selected and the
Captain paid fora suit and waists and hats and other things which it
appeared were necessary for the wardrobe of a young lady at finishing
school Shadrach would have bought lavishly but Mrs Wyeths common
sense guided the selections and MaryGusta was very particular as to
price Shadrach at the beginning made a few suggestions concerning
colors and styles but the suggestions were disregarded The Captains
taste in colors was not limited he fancied almost any hue provided
it was bright enough His ward would have looked like an animated crazy
quilt if he had had his way

He grumbled a little as they journeyed back to South Harniss

She may be all right that Wyeth woman he said but shes too
everlastin sobersided to suit me Take that hat you and she bought
why twas as plain and hadnt no more fuss and feathers than a
ministers wifes bonnet You aint an old maid no nor a Boston
firstfamily widow neither Now the hat I likedthe yellow and blue
onehad some getupandgit If you wore that out on Tremont Street
folks would turn around and look at you

MaryGusta laughed and squeezed his hand You silly Uncle Shad she
said dont you know that is exactly what I dont want them to do

Shadrach turned his gaze in her direction She was at the end of the
car seat next to the window and against the light of the setting sun her
face and head were silhouetted in dainty profile The Captain sighed

Well he said philosophically I dont knows we need to argue I
callate theyll look some as tis

Her parting instructions to her uncles were many and diversified Zoeth
must be sure and change to his heavy flannels on the first of October
He must not forget rubbers when the ground was damp and an umbrella
when it rained If he caught cold there was the medicine Doctor Harley
had prescribed He must not sit up after ten oclock he must not try
to read the paper without first hunting for his spectacles These were a
few of his orders Shadrachs list was even longer It included going
to church every other Sunday keeping his Sunday shoes blacked not
forgetting to change his collar every morning to get his hair cut
at least once in six weeks not to eat pie just before going to bed
because you know if you do you always have the nightmare and groan
and moan and wake up everyone but yourself not to say Jumpin or
Creepin Judas any oftener than he could help to be sure and not
cut prices in the store just because a customer asked him to do soand
goodness knows how much more

As for Isaiah Chase his list was so lengthy and varied that the
responsibility quite overwhelmed him

Gosh tmighty exclaimed Isaiah desperately Ill never be able to
live up to all them sailin orders and I know it Ive put some of em
down on a piece of paper but I aint even got them straight and as for
the million or two otherswhew Im to dust every day and sweep every
other day and change the tablecloth and see that the washin goes when
it ought to and feed the horse the catno no feed the cat oatsOh
consarn it Feed the cat and the horse and the hens their reglar
vittles at reglar times andandOh my soul Yes and let alone my
own self and all thats laid onto me I must keep an eye on Captain Shad
and Zoeth and see that they do whats been laid onto THEM I swan to
man Im a hardworkin painstakin feller of my age but I aint as
young as I used to be and Im human and not a walkin steamengyne
Ill do the best I can butbut first thing you know Ill be drove into
heavin up my job THEN this craftll be on its beam ends I bet you
Theyll appreciate me then when its too late

The farewells at the railway station were brief They were very hard to
say and neither the partners nor MaryGusta could trust themselves to
talk more than was necessary The train drew up beside the platform
then it moved on A hand waved from the car window Shadrach and Zoeth
waved in return The rear car disappeared around the curve by Solomon
Higgins cranberry shanty

Mr Hamilton sighed heavily

Shes gone Shadrach he said MaryGustas gone

Shadrach echoed the sigh

Yes shes gone he agreed I feel as if the best part of you and me
had gone along with her Well tother parts have got to go back to the
store and wait on customers I presume likely Heave ahead and lets do
it Ah hum I callate wed ought to be thankful weve got work to do
Zoeth Itll help take up our minds There are goin to be lonesome days
for you and me shipmate

There were lonely days for MaryGusta also those of that first month
at Mrs Wyeths and at the Misses Cabots school For the first time in
her life she realized what it meant to be homesick But in the letters
which she wrote to her uncles not a trace of the homesickness was
permitted to show and little by little its keenest pangs wore away She
too was thankful for work for the study which kept her from thinking
of other things

The Misses Cabottheir Christian names were Priscilla and Hortenseshe
found to be middleaged maiden ladies eminently prim and proper
and the educational establishment over which they presided a sort of
Protestant nunnery ruled according to the precepts of the Congregational
Church and the New England aristocracy Miss Priscilla was tall and thin
and her favorite author was Emerson she quoted Emerson extensively and
was certain that real literature died when he did Miss Hortense
was younger plumper and more romantic She quoted Longfellow and
occasionally Oliver Wendell Holmes although she admitted she considered
the latter rather too frivolous at times Both sisters were learned
dignified and strict disciplinarians Also in the eyes of both a male
person younger than fortyfive was labeled DangerKeep Away But
one creature of the masculine gender taught in their school he was
whitehaired Doctor Barnes professor of the dead languages It was the
prevailing opinion among the scholars that Doctor Barnes when at home
occupied an apartment in the Greek Antiquity section of the Art Museum
where he slept and ate surrounded by the statues and busts of his
contemporaries

As for the scholars themselves there were about forty of them
girlsor young ladies the Misses Cabot invariably referred to
and addressed them as young ladiesfrom Boston and New York and
Philadelphia even from Chicago and as far south as Baltimore Almost
all were the daughters of welltodo parents almost all had their homes
in cities There were very few who like MaryGusta had lived all
their lives in the country Some were pretty some were not some were
giddy and giggly some solemn and studious some either according to
mood some were inclined to be snobbish others simple and everyday
In short the school was like almost any school of its kind

MaryGusta entered this school and doing so ceased to be MaryGusta
becoming Miss Lathrop to her instructors and Mary to her intimates among
the scholars And at Mrs Wyeths she was Mary or Miss Lathrop or Miss
Mary according to the age length of acquaintance or station of the
person addressing her But she always thought of herself as MaryGusta
and her letters written to Uncle Shad or Uncle Zoeth were so signed

She found after the hard work of beginning that she could keep abreast
of her class in studies without undue exertion Also she found that the
snobs excepted the girls at the Misses Cabots school were inclined to
be sociable and friendly She made no bid for their friendship being a
selfrespecting young person whose dislike of imitation was as strong as
ever but perhaps because she did not bid or imitate but continued
to be simply and sincerely herself friends came to her Most of these
friends received monthly allowances far greater than hers and most of
them wore more expensive gowns and in greater variety but she showed
no envy nor offered apologies and if she sometimes wished being human
that her wardrobe was a trifle more extensive she kept that wish to
herself

Her liking for Mrs Wyeth grew into a real affection And the prim and
practical matron grew more and more fond of her The girl came to be
considered and almost to consider herself one of the family The
family consisted of Mrs Wyeth Mary Miss Pease the other paying
guest and Maggie the maid and Nora the cook Miss Pease was an
elderly spinster without near relatives possessed of an income and a
love of travel which she gratified by occasional European trips She
and her closest friend Mrs Wyeth disagreed on many subjects but
they united in the belief that Boston was a suburb of Paradise and that
William Ellery Channing was the greatest of religious leaders They
attended the Arlington Street Unitarian Church and Mary often
accompanied them there for Sunday morning or afternoon service

The conviction of the Misses Cabot that youthful manhood was dangerous
and to be shunned like the plague Mary soon discovered was not shared
by the majority of the young ladies If Miss Priscilla and Miss Hortense
had had their way Harvard University and the Institute of Technology
would have been moved forthwith to some remote spot like the North Pole
or San Francisco There were altogether too many cousins or sons
of old family friends calling at the school to deliver messages from
parents or guardians or the said friends These messengers young
gentlemen with budding mustaches and fullblown raiment were rigidly
inspected and their visits carefully chaperoned but letters came and
were treasured and the cheerful inanity of their contents imparted in
strict secrecy to bosom friends of the recipients

Mary received no such letters No cousins or family friends called to
deliver messages to her No photographs of young fellows in lettered
sweaters were hidden among her belongings Her friends in the school
thought this state of affairs very odd and they sometimes asked pointed
questions

Miss Barbara Howe whose home was in Brookline and whose father was the
senior partner of an old and wellknown firm of downtown merchants was
the leading questioner She liked Mary and the latter liked her Barbara
was pretty and full of spirits and although she was the only child and
a rather spoiled one in a wealthy family there was no snobbishness in
her makeup

But I cant see she declared what you have been doing all the time
Where have you been keeping yourself Dont you know ANYBODY

Mary smiled Oh yes she replied I know a good many people

You know what I mean Dont you know any of the fellows at Harvard or
Tech or Yale or anywhere I know dozens And you must know some You
know Sam Keith you said you did

Mary admitted that she knew Sam slightly

Isnt he fun Sam and I are great chums Doesnt he dance divinely

I dont know I never saw him dance

Then youve missed something Do you know his friend the one on the
football teamCrawford Smith his name isdo you know him

Mary nodded IIve met him she said

You HAVE Dont you think he is perfectly splendid

I dont know Is he

Of course he is Havent you read about him in the papers He made that
long run for a touchdown in the Yale game Oh you should have seen it
I couldnt speak for two days after that game He was just as cool and
calm All the Yale men were trying to get him and he dodgedI never saw
anyone so cool and who kept his head so well

I thought the papers spoke most of the way he kept his feet

Then you did read about it Of course you did Im just dying to know
him All the girls are crazy about him Where did you meet him Tell
me

Mary smiled On the occasion of her only meeting with Crawford Smith
that young fellow had been anything but cool

I met him in my uncles store at South Harniss she said It was
three years ago

And you havent seen him since He is a great friend of Sams And
Sams people have a summer home at the Cape Perhaps youll meet him
there again

Perhaps

Goodness One would think you didnt want to

Why I dont know that I do particularly Why should I

Why should you Mary Lathrop I do think you are the queerest girl You
dont talk like a girl at all Sometimes I think you are as old asas
Prissy Prissy was the disrespectful nickname by which the young
ladies referred behind her back to Miss Priscilla Cabot

Mary laughed Not quite I hope she said But I dont see why I
should be so very anxious to meet Crawford Smith And Im sure he isnt
anxious to meet me If all the other girls are crazy about him that
ought to be enough I should think

This astonishing profession of indifference to the fascination of the
football hero indifference which Miss Barbara declared to be only
makebelieve was made on a Saturday The next day as Mrs Wyeth
and Mary were on their way home from church the former made an
announcement

We are to have a guest perhaps guests at dinner this noon she
said Sunday dinner at Mrs Wyeths was served according to New England
custom at one oclock

Samuel Mr John Keiths son is to dine with us continued Mrs
Wyeth He may bring a college friend with him You have met Samuel
havent you Mary

Mary said that she had She was a trifle embarrassed at the prospect of
meeting Sam Keith in her new surroundings At home in South Harniss
they had met many times but always at the store He was pleasant
and jolly and she liked him well enough although she had refused his
invitations to go on sailing parties and the like She knew perfectly
well that his mother and sister would not have approved of these
invitations for in the feminine Keith mind there was a great gulf fixed
between the summer resident and the native The latter was to be helped
and improved but not encouraged socially beyond a certain point Mary
sought neither help nor improvement of that kind Sam it is true had
never condescended or patronized but he had never called at her home
nor had she been asked to visit his

And now she was to meet him in a house where she was considered one of
the family His father had been influential in bringing her there Did
Sam know this and if he did what influence would the knowledge have
upon his manner toward her Would he be lofty and condescending or on
the other hand would he pretend a familiar acquaintanceship which did
not exist Alone in her room she considered these questions and then put
them from her mind Whatever his manner might be hers she determined
should be what it had always been And if any embarrassment was evident
to others at this meeting it should not be on her part

When she came downstairs Mrs Wyeth called to her to come into the
parlor As she entered the room two young men rose from the chairs
beside the mahogany center table One of these young men was Sam Keith
she had expected to see Sam of course But the otherthe other was the
very individual in whose daring deeds and glorified personality she had
expressed a complete lack of interest only the day before the young
fellow whom she had last seen racing madly across the fields in the rear
of Hamilton and Companys store with the larger portion of a sheet of
sticky fly paper attached to his white flannels Mr Crawford Smith was
taller and broader than on that memorable occasion but she recognized
him instantly

It was evident that he did not recognize her Mrs Wyeth came to meet
her

Mary she said you know Samuel I think You and he have met before
Samuel will you introduce your friend

Sam was staring at Mary with eyes which expressed a variety of emotions
intense surprise the most prominent He was in a state which Barbara
Howe would have described as fussed one most unusual for him He had
known of Marys presence in the house after the affair was settled John
Keith told his family what he had done facing with serene philosophy
his wifes displeasure and prophecies of certain regrets Sam had vivid
and pleasing recollections of the pretty country girl in the South
Harniss store He had not told his college friend that they were to meet
her that day one reason being that he was not certain they would meet
and the other a secret misgiving that it might be well to wait and
inspect and listen before boasting of previous acquaintanceship Sams
mother had lectured him on the subject before he left home Dont be
too familiar Sam was her warning You may be sorry if you do The
girl is well enough here in South Harniss where she is accustomed
to her surroundings but in Boston she may be quite out of place and
impossible I have told your father so but he wont listen of course
Dont YOU be foolish for my sake

But here was no green country girl The selfpossessed young woman who
stood before him looked no more out of place and impossible in Mrs
Wyeths dignified and aristocratic parlor than she had in the store
where he had last seen her Her gown was simple and inexpensive but
it was stylish and becoming And her mannerwell her manner was
distinctly more at ease than his at that moment Mary had been but eight
weeks among the Misses Cabots young ladies but she had used her eyes
and her brain during that time she was adaptable and had learned other
things than those in the curriculum Also she was prepared for this
meeting and had made up her mind to show no embarrassment

So the usually blase Samuel was the embarrassed party He looked and
stammered Mrs Wyeth was surprised and shocked

Samuel she said sharply what is the matter with you Why dont you
speak and not stand there staring

Sam with an effort recovered some of his selfpossession

Was I staring he said I beg your pardon Cousin Emily ErHow do
you do Miss Lathrop

Mrs Wyeth sniffed

Mercy she exclaimed Is your acquaintance as formal as that I
thought you knew each other The boys and girls of this generation are
beyond me Miss Lathrop indeed

Mary smiled Perhaps he didnt expect to see me here Mrs Wyeth she
said How do you do Sam

She and Sam shook hands Mrs Wyeth asked another question

Didnt you know Mary was with me Samuel she asked

Oh yes Cousin Emily I knew I knew she was here of course Butbut
I didntby George with a sudden outburst of his real feelings I
hardly knew her though Really I didnt

Mary laughed Have I grown so much older in two months she asked

Oh you havent changed that way II The young man realizing that
he was getting into deep water seized an opportunity to scramble out
Oh I forgot he exclaimed Sorry Crawford MaryMiss Lathrop I
want to present my friend Crawford Smith Hes my roommate at college

Mary and Crawford shook hands

I have met Mr Smith too before she said

The young gentlemen both of them looked astonished

Have you cried Sam Oh I say I didnt know that When was it

His friend too was plainly puzzled I hardly think so he said I
dont believe I should have forgotten it I dont remember

Dont you remember coming into my uncles store at South Harniss
with Miss Keith Sams sister You bought somewith a mischievous
twinklesome marshmallows among other things I sold them to you

You Great Scott Are youwhy that girls name waswhat was it

It was the same as mine Mary Augusta Lathrop But in South Harniss
they call me MaryGusta

That was it And you are MaryGusta Yes of course you are Well
I ought to be ashamed I suppose but I didnt recognize you I AM
ashamed I was awfully obliged to you that day You helped me out of a
scrape

Sam who had been listening with increasing curiosity broke in

Say whats all this he demanded When was this Crawford What
scrape You never told me

And you didnt tell me that Miss Lathrop was here You didnt say a
word about her

Eh Didnt I I must have forgotten to mention it Sheshe IS here
you know Mrs Wyeth shook her head

Samuel youre perfectly idiotic today she declared Of course she
is here anyone with eyes can see she is She isahemvisiting me
and she is attending the Misses Cabots school There Now Mr Smith
understands I hope And dinner is ready Dont any of you say another
word until we are at the table My father used to say that lukewarm soup
was the worst sort of cold reception and I agree with him

During dinner Sam was tremendously curious to discover how and where his
friend and Mary had met and what the scrape might be to which Crawford
had referred But his curiosity was unsatisfied Mr Smith refused to
tell and Mary only smiled and shook her head when questioned

The young people furnished most of the conversation during the meal
The recent football season and its triumphant ending were discussed of
course and the prospects of the hockey team came in for its share Sam
it appeared was out for a place on the hockey squad

You must see some of the games Mary he said Ill get tickets for
you and Cousin Emily Youre crazy about sports arent you Cousin
Emily

Mrs Wyeth regarded him through her eyeglasses

I imagine she observed that that remark is intended as a joke I
saw one football game and the spectacle of those boys trampling each
other to death before my eyes and of you Samuel Keith hopping up and
down shrieking Tear em up and Smash em was the nearest approach
to insanity I ever experienced Since that time I have regarded Doctor
Eliot as President Emeritus of an asylum and NOT a university

Sam was hugely delighted Thats football he declared I will admit
that no one but lunatics like Crawford here play football Hockey now
is different I play hockey

Crawford seemed surprised

Do you he asked with eager interest No one has ever guessed it
not even the coach You shouldnt keep it a secret from HIM Sam

Miss Pease having been invited out that day was not present at dinner
After the coffee was served the irrepressible Sam proposed a walk

You wont care to go Cousin Emily he said but Im sure Mary will
It is a fine afternoon and she needs the air Crawford isnt much of a
walker he can stay and keep Cousin Emily company We wont be long

Before Mary could decline this disinterested invitation Mrs Wyeth saved
her the trouble

Thank you Samuel she said crisply Your kindness is appreciated
particularly by Mr Smith and myself I can see that he is delighted
with the idea But Mary and I are going to the afternoon service at the
Arlington Street church So you will have to excuse us

This should have been a squelcher but it was not Sam announced that he
and Crawford would go with them We were thinking of going to church
werent we Crawford It is just what I suggested you remember

Mrs Wyeth said Humph and that was all She and Mary went to their
rooms to get ready Sam surprised at the unexpected success of his
sudden inspiration and immensely tickled chuckled in triumph But his
joy was materially lessened when the quartette left the house

These sidewalks are too narrow for four declared Mrs Wyeth Samuel
you may walk with me Mary you and Mr Smith must keep close at our
heels and walk fast I never permit myself or my guests to be late at
church

During the walk Crawford asked a number of questions How long had his
companion been in the city How long did she intend staying Did she
plan returning to the school for another year Where would she spend the
Christmas vacation Mary said she was going home to South Harniss for
the holidays

Its a bully old place Cape Cod declared Crawford I never had a
better time than I did on that visit at Sams Wish I were going there
again some day

Why dont you asked Mary

The young man shook his head Orders from home he said Father
insists on my coming home to him the moment the term closes I made that
visit to Sams on my own responsibility and I got fits for doing it Dad
seems to have a prejudice against the East He wont come here himself
and he doesnt like to have me stay any longer than is absolutely
necessary When I wrote him I was at South Harniss he telegraphed me to
come home in a hurry He is Eastern born himself lived somewhere
this way when he was young but he doesnt talk about it and has more
prejudices against Eastern ways and Eastern people than if hed lived
all his life in Carson City Wont even come on to see me play football
I doubt if he comes to Commencement next spring and I graduate too

I wonder he permitted you to go to Harvard said Mary

He had to permit it Ive always been for Harvard ever since I thought
about college Dad was all for a Western university but I sat back in
the stirrups and pulled for Harvard and finally he gave in He generally
gives in if I buck hard enough Hes a bully old Dad and were great
pals more like brothers than father and son The only point where we
disagree is his confounded sectional prejudice He thinks the sun not
only sets in the West but rises there

The girl learned that he intended entering the Harvard Medical School in
the fall

I had to fight for that too he said with a laugh Ive always
wanted to be a doctor but Dad wouldnt give in for ever so long He is
interested in mining properties there at home and it was his idea that I
should come in with him when I finished school But I couldnt see it
I wanted to study medicine Dad says there are almost as many starving
doctors as there are downattheheel lawyers if I go in with him he
says I shall have what is practically a sure thing and a soft snap for
the rest of my days That doesnt suit me I want to work I expect to
I want to paddle my own canoe I may be the poorest MD that ever put
up a sign but Im going to put that sign up just the same And if I
starve I shant ask him or anyone else to feed me

He laughed again as he said it but there was a determined ring in his
voice and a square set to his chin which Mary noticed and liked He
meant what he said that was evident

I think a doctors profession is one of the noblest and finest in the
world she said

Do you Good for you So do I It doesnt bring in the dollars as fast
as some others but it does seem a mans job to me The big specialists
make a lot of money too but that isnt exactly what I mean Some of the
best men Ive met were just country doctors working night and day in
all sorts of weather and getting paid or not just as it happened That
old Doctor Harley down in your town is one of that kind I think I saw
something of his work while I was there

Did you I shouldnt have thought you had time for that with all the
picnics and sailing parties

I did though I met him at Sams Mrs Keith had a cold or a cough or
something He and I got to talking and he asked me to come and see him
I went you bet Went out with him on some of his drives while he made
his calls you know He told me a lot of things Hes a brick

Its queer he went on after a moment but I felt really at home
down there in that little place Seemed as if I had been there before
andandby George almost as if I belonged there It was my first
experience on and around salt water but that seemed natural too And
the peopleI mean the people that belong there not the summer crowdI
liked them immensely Those two fine old cards that kept the storeEh
I beg pardon they are relatives of yours arent they I forgot

They are my uncles said Mary simply I have lived with them almost
all my life They are the best men in the world

They seemed like it Id like to know them better Hello heres that
confounded church Ive enjoyed this walk ever so much Guess Ive done
all the talking though Hope I havent bored you to death gassing about
my affairs

No you havent I enjoyed it

Did you really Yes I guess you did or you wouldnt say so You dont
act like a girl that pretends By George Its a relief to have someone
to talk to someone that understands and appreciates what a fellow is
thinking about Most girls want to talk football and dancing and all
that I like football immensely and dancing too but there is something
else in life Even Samhes as good as they make but he doesnt care to
listen to anything seriousthat is not long

Mary considered I enjoyed listening she said and I was glad to
hear you liked South Harniss and my uncles

On the way home after the service it was Sam Keith who escorted Mary
while Mrs Wyeth walked with Mr Smith Sams conversation was not
burdened with seriousness Hockey dances and good times were the
subjects he dealt with Was his companion fond of dancing Would she
accompany him to one of the club dances some time They were great fun
Mrs Wyeth could chaperon them of course

Mary said she was afraid she would be too busy to accept As a matter
of fact knowing what she did of his mothers feelings she would have
accepted no invitations from Sam Keith even if nothing else prevented
her doing so

My studies take a good deal of my time she said

Sam laughed Youll get over that he declared I studied like blue
blazes my freshman year but after thatI should worry Say Im
mighty glad I came over here today Im coming again Ill be a regular
boarder

The young men said goodby at the Wyeth door Mrs Wyeth did not ask
them in although the persistent Samuel threw out some pointed hints

Crawford Smith and Mary shook hands

Ive had an awfully good time declared the former Then turning to
Mrs Wyeth he asked May I call occasionally

Mrs Wyeths answer was as usual frank and unmistakable

Yes she said I shall be very glad to see youoccasionally

Crawford turned to Mary

May I he asked

Mary scarcely knew how to reply There was no real reason why he should
not call she liked him so far His frankness and earnestness of purpose
appealed to her And yet she was not at all sure that it was wise to
continue the acquaintance In her mind this coming to Boston to school
was a very serious matter Her uncles had sent her there to study they
needed her at home but that need they had sacrificed in order that
she might study and improve Nothing else friendships or good times or
anything must interfere with the purpose with which she had accepted
the sacrifice

So she hesitated

May I repeated Crawford

Why I dont know I imagine I shall be very busy most of the time

Thats all right If youre busy you can send word for me to vamoose
That will be part of the bargain Goodby

Mrs Wyeths first remark after entering was concerning Sams friend

I rather like that young person she said Samuel idolizes him of
course but Samuel would worship a hyena if it played football But this
Smith boyin Mrs Wyeths mind any male under thirty was a boyseems
to have some common sense and a mind of his own I dont approve of his
name nor the howling wilderness he comes from but he cant help those
drawbacks I suppose However if he is to call here we must know
something about him I shall make inquiries




CHAPTER XII


The school term ended on a Saturday morning in midDecember Marys
trunk was packed and ready and she and it reached the South Station
long before train time She was going home home for the holidays and
if she had been going on a trip around the world she could not have been
more delighted at the prospect And her delight and anticipations were
shared in South Harniss Her uncles letters for the past fortnight had
contained little except joyful announcements of preparations for her
coming


We are counting the minutes wrote Zoeth The first thing Shadrach does
every morning is to scratch another day off the calendar I never saw
him so worked up and excited and I calculate I aint much different
myself I try not to set my heart on things of this world more than I
ought to but it does seem as if I couldnt think of much else but our
girls coming back to us I am not going to worry the way Shadrach does
about your getting here safe and sound The Lords been mighty good to
us and I am sure He will fetch you to our door all right I am contented
to trust you in His hands

PS One or both of us will meet you at the depot


Captain Shads epistle was more worldly but not more coherent


Be sure and take the train that comes right on through he wrote Dont
take the one that goes to Woods Hole Zoeth is so fidgety and nervous
for fear you will make a mistake that he keeps me on pins and needles
Isaiah aint much better He swept out the settingroom twice last week
and if he dont roast the cat instead of the chicken he is calculating
to kill it will be a mercy I am the only one aboard the ship that
keeps his head and I tell them not to worry Be sure you take that
through train And look out for them electric cars if you come to the
depot in one Better settle on the one you are going to take and then
take the one ahead of it so as to be sure and not be late Your train
leaves the dock at quarterpast four The Woods Hole one is two minutes
earlier Look out and not take that Zoeth is afraid you will make a
mistake but I laugh at him Dont take the wrong train


Mary laughed when she read these letters but there was a choke in the
laugh In spite of the perils of travel by the electrics and the New
Haven railroad she reached South Harniss safe sound and reasonably
on time The first person she saw on the platform of the station was
Captain Shadrach He had been pacing that platform for at least forty
minutes

He spied her at the same time and came rushing to greet her both hands
outstretched

And here you be he exclaimed with enthusiasm

Mary laughed happily

Yes Uncle Shad here I am she said Are you glad to see me

Shadrach looked at her

JUMPIN was the only answer he made but it was fervent and
sufficient

They rode home together in the old buggy As they reached the corner by
the store Mary expected the vehicle to be brought to a halt at the curb
but it was not The Captain chirruped to the horse and drove straight
on

Why Uncle Shad exclaimed the girl Arent you going to stop

Eh Stop What for

Why to see Uncle Zoeth of course Hes at the store isnt he

Shadrach shook his head

No he aint he said Hes to home

Mary was amazed and a trifle alarmed One partner of Hamilton and
Company was there in the buggy with her By all the rules of precedent
and South Harniss business the other should have been at the store She
knew that her uncles had employed no clerk or assistant since she left

Butbut is Uncle Zoeth sick she asked

Sick No no course he aint sick If he didnt have no better sense
than to get sick the day you come home IdIdI dont knows
I wouldnt drown him HE aint sickunless he added as an
afterthought hes got Saint Vitus dance from hoppin up and down to
look out of the window watchin for us

But if he isnt sick why isnt he at the store Who is there

The Captain chuckled

Not a solitary soul he declared That stores shut up tight and
its goin to stay that way this whole blessed evenin Zoeth and me
we talked it over I didnt know but wed better get Abel Snows boy or
that pesky Annabel or somebody to stay while we was havin supper You
see we was both sot on eatin supper with you tonight no matter store
or not and Isaiah he was just as sot as we was But all to once Zoeth
had an idea Shadrach he says in Scriptur times when people was
real happy same as we are now they used to make a sacrifice to the
Almighty to show how glad and grateful they was Lets you and me make a
sacrifice lets sacrifice this evenins tradelets shut up the store
on account of our girls comin home Good idea says I so we did
it

Mary looked at him reproachfully

Oh Uncle Shad she said you shouldnt have done that It was dear
and sweet of you to think of it but you shouldnt have done it It
didnt need any sacrifice to prove that you were glad to see me

Shadrach winked over his shoulder

Dont let that sacrifice worry you any he observed The sacrifice is
mainly in Zoeths eye Furs Im concernedwell Jabez Hedges told
me yesterday that Rastus Young told him he callated hed have to be
droppin in at the store some of these nights to buy some rubber boots
and new ileskins We sold him the ones hes got four years ago and he
aint paid for em yet No no MaryGusta dont you worry about that
sacrifice I can sacrifice Rastus Youngs trade eight days in the week
and make money by it Course I didnt tell Zoeth that have to humor
these pious folks much as we can you know

Mary smiled but she shook her head Its no use your talking to me in
that way Uncle Shad she said I know you too well And right in the
Christmas season too

Zoeths welcome was as hearty if not as exuberant as Captain Shads
He met her at the door and after the first hug and kiss held her off at
arms length and looked her over

My my my he exclaimed And this is our little MaryGusta come
back again It dont seem as if it could be somehow

But it is Uncle Zoeth declared Mary laughing And ISNT it good
to be here Well Isaiah turning to Mr Chase who aproned and
shirtsleeved as usual had been standing grinning in the background
havent you anything to say to me

Isaiah had something to say and he said it

Glad to see you he announced Feelin pretty smart Got a new hat
aint you Suppers ready

During the meal Mary was kept busy answering questions concerning school
and her life at Mrs Wyeths In her letters she had endeavored to tell
every possible item of news which might be interesting to her uncles
but now these items were one by one recalled reviewed and discussed

Twas kind of funny that young Smith fellers turnin up for dinner
that time observed Mr Hamilton Callate you was some surprised to
see him want you

Mary smiled Why yes she said but I think he was more surprised to
see me Uncle Zoeth

Captain Shad laughed heartily Shouldnt wonder he admitted Didnt
bring any fly paper along with him did he No Well that was an
oversight Maybe he thought fly time was past and gone He seemed to be
a real nice kind of young feller when he was down here that summer Hes
older now does he seem that way yet

Why yes I think so I only saw him for a little while

Isaiah seemed to think it time for him to put in a question

Good lookin as ever I callate aint he he observed

Mary was much amused Why I suppose he is she answered But why in
the world are you interested in his good looks Isaiah

Mr Chase did his best to assume an expression of deep cunning He
winked at his employers

Oh I aint interestednot special he declared but I didnt know
but SOME folks might be Ho ho

He roared at his own pleasantry Captain Shadrach however did not
laugh

Some folks he repeated tartly What are you talkin about What
folks

Oh I aint sayin what folks Im just sayin SOME folks Ho ho You
know what I mean dont you MaryGusta

Before Mary could reply the Captain cut in again

No she dont know what you mean neither he declared with emphasis
Thats enough of that now Isaiah Dont be any bigger fool than you
can help

The selfsatisfied grin faded from Isaiahs face and was succeeded by a
look of surprised and righteous indignation

Whawhats that he stammered Whats that youre callin me

I aint callin you nothin Im givin you some free advice thats
all Well MaryGusta I callate if youve had supper enough you and
me and Zoeth will go into the settinroom where we can all talk and I
can smoke I can always talk better under a full head of steam Come on
Zoeth Isaiah wants to be clearin the table

But Mr Chases thoughts were not concerned with table clearing just
then He stepped between Captain Shadrach and the door leading to the
sittingroom

Capn Shad Gould he sputtered youyou said somethin about a fool
Whos a fool Thats what I want to knowwhos a fool

The Captain grunted

Give it up he observed I never was any hand at riddles Come come
Isaiah Get out of the channel and let us through

You hold on Capn Shad You answer me afore you leave this room Whos
a fool I want to know whos a fool

Captain Shad grinned

Well go up to the postoffice and ask some of the gang there he
suggested Tell em youll give em three guesses There there he
added goodnaturedly pushing the irate Mr Chase out of the channel
Dont block the fairway any longer Its all right Isaiah You and
me have been shipmates too long to fight now You riled me up a little
thats all Come on folks

Two hours later after Mary had answered the last questions even Captain
Shad could think of had received answers to all her own and had
gone to her room for the night Mr Hamilton turned to his partner and
observed mildly

Shadrach what made you so dreadful peppery to Isaiah this evenin I
declare I thought you was goin to take his head off

The Captain grunted I will take it off some time he declared if he
dont keep the lower end of it shut when hed ought to You heard what
he said didnt you

Yes I heard That about the Smith boys good looks you mean

Sartin And about MaryGustas noticin how goodlookin he was
Rubbish

Yesyes I know but Isaiah was only jokin

Jokin Well he may LOOK like a comic almanac but he neednt try to
joke like one while that girl of ours is around Puttin notions about
fellers and good looks and keepin company into her head You might
expect such stuff from them fool drummers that come to the store but an
old leatherskinned image like Isaiah Chase ought to have more sense We
dont want such notions put in her head do we

Zoeth rubbed his chin He did not speak and his silence seemed to
irritate his partner

Well do we repeated the latter sharply

Zoeth sighed No Shadrach he admitted I guess likely we dont
but

But what

Well weve got to realize that those kind of notions comecome sort
of natural to young folks MaryGustas age

Rubbish I dont believe that girls got a single one of em in her
mind

Maybe not but theyll be there some day Ah well he added we
mustnt be selfish you and me Shadrach Itll be dreadful hard to give
her up to somebody else but if that somebody is a good man kind and
straight and honest why I for one will try not to complain But Oh
Shadrach Suppose he should turn out to be the other thing Suppose SHE
makes the mistake that I

His friend interrupted

Shh shh he broke in quickly Dont talk so Zoeth Come on to
bed he added rising from his chair This very evenin I was callin
Isaiah names for talkin about fellers and such and here you and I
have been sittin talkin nothin else If you hear me say fool in my
sleep tonight just understand Im talkin to myself thats all Come on
aloft Zoeth and turn in

The following morning Mary astonished her uncles by announcing that
as soon as she had helped Isaiah with the breakfast dishes and the bed
making she was going up to the store

What for demanded Captain Shad Course well be mighty glad to have
your company but Zoeth and me presumed likely youd be for goin round
callin on some of the other girls today

Well Im not If they want to see me they can call on me here Im
going up to the store with you and Uncle Zoeth I want to help sell
those Christmas goods of ours

The partners looked at each other Even Zoeth was moved to protest

Now MaryGusta he said it aint likely that your Uncle Shadrach
and I are goin to let you sell goods in that store We wont hear of
it will we Shadrach

Not by a thunderin sight declared Shadrach vehemently The idea

Why not Ive sold a good many there

I dont care if you have You shant sell any more Twas all right
when you was just aa girl a South Harnisser like the rest of us but
now that youre a Boston young lady up to a finerwhatdyecallit
erendin school

Finishin school Shadrach corrected Mr Hamilton

Well whatever tis I know twould be the end of ME if I had to live
up to the style of it Anyhow now that youre there MaryGusta a
young lady same as I said we aint

But Mary interrupted Hush Uncle Shad she commanded Hush this
minute Youre talking nonsense I AM a South Harniss girl and Im NOT
a Boston young lady My chief reasons for being so very happy at the
thought of coming home here for my Christmas vacation were first that
I should see you and Uncle Zoeth and Isaiah and the house and the horse
and the cat and the hens and next that I could help you with the
Christmas trade at the store I know perfectly well you need me Im
certain you have been absolutely lost without me Now really and truly
havent you

Not a mite declared the Captain stoutly spoiling the effect of the
denial however by adding although his partner had not spoken Shut
up Zoeth We aint neither

Mary laughed Uncle Shad she said I dont believe you At any rate
Im going up there this minute to see for myself Come along

She made no comment on what she saw at the store but for the remainder
of the forenoon she was very busy In spite of the partners protests
in fact paying no more attention to those perturbed men of business than
if they were flies to be brushed aside when bothersome she went ahead
arranging rearranging dusting writing price tickets lettering
placards doing all sorts of things and waiting on customers in the
intervals At noon when she and her Uncle Zoeth left for home and
dinner she announced herself in a measure satisfied Of course there
is a great deal to do yet she said but the stock looks a little more
as if it were meant to sell and less as if it were heaped up ready to be
carted off and buried

That afternoon the store of Hamilton and Company was visited by a goodly
number of South Harniss residents That evening there were more The
news that MaryGusta Lathrop was at home and was tendin store for
her uncles spread and was much discussed The majority of those who came
did so not because they contemplated purchasing extensively but because
they wished to see what effect the fashionable finishing school had had
upon the girl The general opinion seemed to be that it hadnt changed
her a mite This result however was considered a desirable one by the
majority but was by some criticized Among the critics was Mrs Rebecca
Mullet whose daughter Irene also was away at school undergoing the
finishing process

Well declared Mrs Mullet with decision as she and her husband
emerged from the store together Well If THATS a sample of what
the school she goes to does for them that spend their money on it Im
mighty glad we didnt send our Rena there aint you Christopher

Mr Chris Mullet who had received that very week a bill for his
daughters extras uttered a fervent assent

You bet you he said It costs enough where Rena is without sendin
her to no more expensive place

This was not exactly the reply his wife had expected

Umph she grunted impatiently I do wish you could get along for
two minutes without puttin on poor mouth I suppose likely you tell
everybody that you cant afford a new overcoat account of Renas goin
away to school Youd ought to be prouder of your daughter than you are
of an overcoat I should think

Mr Mullet muttered something to the effect that he was dum sure he was
not proud of his present overcoat His wife ignored the complaint

And youll be proud of Irene when she comes home she declared She
wont be like that MaryGusta standin up behind the counter and
sellin goods

Why now Becky whats the matter with her doin that She always used
to sell goods and behind that very counter too And she certainly can
SELL em with a reminiscent chuckle

Mrs Mullet glared at him Yes she drawled with sarcasm so she
canto some folks Look at you with all that Christmas junk under your
arm You didnt need to buy that stuff any moren you needed to fly
What did you buy it for Tell me that

Chris shook his head Blessed if I know he admitted I hadnt any
idea of buyin it but she and me got to talkin and she kept showin
the things to me and I kept lookin at em and

Yes and kept lookin at her too Dont talk to ME Theres no fool
like an old fooland an old man fool is the worst of all

Her husband usually meek and longsuffering under wifely discipline
evinced unwonted spirit

Well I tell you this Becky he said Furs I can see MaryGustas
all right Shes as pretty as a picture to begin with shes got money
of her own to spend and shes been away among folks that have got a lot
more All them things together are enough to spoil most any girl but
they havent spoiled her Shes come home here not a mite stuckup not
flirty nor silly nor toplofty but just as sensible and capable and
commonfolksy as ever she was and thats sayin somethin If our Rena
turns out to be the girl MaryGusta Lathrop is I WILL be proud of her
and dont you forget it

Which terminated conversation in the Mullet family for that evening

But if the few like Mrs Mullet were inclined to criticize the many
like her husband united in declaring Mary to be all right And her
rearranging and displaying of the Christmas goods helped her and her
uncles to dispose of them In fact for the three days before Christmas
it became necessary to call in the services of Annabel as assistant
saleslady The store was crowded particularly in the evenings and
Zoeth and Captain Shad experienced for the first time in months the
sensation of being the heads of a prosperous business

Looks good to see so many young folks in here dont it Zoeth
observed the Captain And not only girls but fellers too Dont know
when Ive seen so many young fellers in here Whos that young squirt
MaryGustas waitin on now The one with the whittledin back to his
overcoat Say Solomon in all his glory wasnt arrayed like one of him
Must be some city feller eh Nobody I know

Zoeth looked at his niece and her customer

Humph he said Guess you aint rubbed your glasses lately Shadrach
Thats Dan Higgins

Mr Higgins it was home for a few days relaxation from the fatigues
of coffin selling and garbed as usual in city clothes the splendor of
which as Captain Shad said afterwards would have given a blind man
eyestrain Daniels arms were filled with purchases and he and Mary
were standing beside the table where the toys and games were displayed
Mary was gazing at the toys Mr Higgins wasnot

The partners regarded the pair for a moment Shadrach frowned

Humph he grunted

Daniels tryin to find somethin his little brotherll like
explained Zoeth

Yes observed the Captain dryly Well he looks as if hed found
somethin HE liked pretty well Here MaryGusta Ill finish waitin
on Dan You just see what Mrs Nickerson wants will you please

Christmas Eve ended the rush of business for Hamilton and Company The
following week the last of Marys vacation was certain to be dull
enough Nothin to do but change presents for folks prophesied
Captain Shad Give them somethin they want and take back somethin
we dont want That kind of trade is like shovelin fog up hill more
exercise than profit

Christmas was a happy day at the white house by the shore a day of
surprises To begin with there were the presents which were beside the
plates at breakfast Mary had brought gifts for all Captain Shadrach
Zoeth and Isaiah There was nothing expensive of course but each had
been chosen to fit the taste and liking of the recipient and there was
no doubt that each choice was a success Isaiah proudly displayed a
jacknife which was a small toolchest having four blades a corkscrew
a screwdriver a chisel a buttonhook and goodness knows what else
besides

Look at that crowed Isaiah exhibiting the knife bristling like a
porcupine on his open palm Look at it By time there aint nothin I
cant do with that knife Every time I look at it I find somethin
new Now I wonder what that is pointing to a particularly large and
ferociouslooking implement which projected from the steel tangle I
callate Ive sized up about everything else but I cant seem to make
out what thats for What do you callate tis Capn Shad

Shadrach looked

Why thats simple he said gravely Thats a crust crowbar

A what

A crust crowbar For openin one of them castiron pies same as you
made for us last week You drill a hole in the crust nigh the edge of
the plate and then put that thing in and pry the upper deck loose Good
idea Isaiah I

Aw go to grass interrupted the indignant Mr Chase I notice you
always eat enough of my pies decksyes and hull and riggin too

Then there was THE great surprise that which the partners had prepared
for their idolized niece Mary found beside her plate a small oblong
package wrapped in tissue paper and labeled To MaryGusta from
Uncle Shadrach and Uncle Zoeth with a Merry Christmas Inside the
paper was a pasteboard box inside that a leather case and inside THAT
a handsome gold watch and chain Then there was much excited exclaiming
and delighted thanks on Marys part and explanations and broad grins on
that of the givers

But you shouldnt have done it Of course you shouldnt protested
Mary Its perfectly lovely and I wanted a watch more than anything
but I KNOW this must have cost a great deal

Never neither protested the Captain We got it wholesale Edgar
Emerys nephew is in the business up to Providence and he picked it out
for us Didnt begin to cost what we callated twould did it Zoeth
When you buy things wholesale that way you can most always callate to
get em lower than you callate to

Mary smiled at this somewhat involved statement but she shook her head

Im sure it cost a great deal more than you should have spent she
said

But you like it dont you queried Zoeth hopefully

Like it Oh Uncle Zoeth dont you KNOW I like it Who could help
liking such a beautiful thing

Hows it show up alongside the watches the other girls have up to that
Boston school asked Shadrach with illconcealed anxiety We wouldnt
want our girls watch to be any cheapern theirs you know

The answer was enthusiastic enough to satisfy even the Captain and Mr
Hamilton

Im sure there isnt another girl in the school whose watch means to
her what this will mean to me declared Mary I shall keep it and love
it all my life

The partners heaved a sigh of relief Whether or not the watch was fine
enough for their MaryGusta had been a source of worriment and much
discussion And then Isaiah with his customary knack of saying the
wrong thing tossed a brickbat into the puddle of general satisfaction

Thats so he said thats so MaryGusta You can keep it all
your life and when you get to be an old woman and married and have
grandchildren then you can give it to them

Captain Shadrach who had taken up his napkin preparatory to tucking
it under his chin turned in his chair and glared at the unconscious
steward

Well by the jumpin fire he exclaimed with conviction The feller
is sartinly possessed Hes lovesick thats whats the matter with him
All he can talk about is somebodys gettin married Are YOU callatin
to get married Isaiah

Me What kind of fool talk is that

Whos the lucky woman

There aint no lucky woman Dont talk so ridiclous All I said was
that when MaryGusta was old and married and had

There you go again Married and children Say did it ever run acrost
your mind that you was a little mite previous

I never said children What I said was when she was old and had
grandchildren

Grandchildren Well thats a dum sight MORE previous Lets have
breakfast all hands for the land sakes Isaiahll have us cruisin
along with the third and fourth generation in a few minutes IM
satisfied with this one

That evening at bedtime as the partners separated in the upper hall to
go to their respective rooms Zoeth said

Shadrach this has been a mighty nice Christmas for us all aint it

Captain Shad nodded emphatically You bet he declared Dont seem to
me I ever remember a nicer one

Nor I neither II wonder

Well heave ahead What are you waitin for What do you wonder

I was just wonderin if twas right for us to be so happy

Right

Yes Have we beenwell good enough this past year to deserve
happiness like this

Shadrach grinned

I aint puttin in any testimony on my own hook he said dryly but
I dont seem to remember your bein desperately wicked Zoeth Course
you MAY have got drunk and disorderly that time when MaryGusta and I
left you and went to Boston but I kind of doubt it

Hush hush Shadrach Dont joke about serious things What I mean is
have you and I walked the Lords way as straight as wed ought to Weve
triedthat is seems s if we hadbut I dont know Anyhow all this
afternoon Ive had a funny feelin that you and me and MaryGusta
waswell was as if the tide had been comin in for us all these years
since shes been livin with us and as if now twould begin to go out
again

The Captain laughed And thats what you call a FUNNY feelin he
exclaimed Zoeth Ive got a funny feelin too but I know whats the
reason for itthe reason is turkey and plum puddin and mince pie and
the land knows what When a couple of old hulks like you and me hist
in a cargo of that kind its no wonder we have feelins Good night
shipmate




CHAPTER XIII


The day after New Years Mary went back to Boston and to school The
long winter termthe term which Madeline Talbott whose father was a
judge called the extreme penaltybegan Bostons famous east winds
so welcome in summer and so raw and penetrating in winter brought their
usual allowance of snow and sleet and the walks from Pinckney Street
to the school and back were not always pleasant Mrs Wyeth had a slight
attack of tonsillitis and Miss Pease a bronchial cold but they united
in declaring these afflictions due entirely to their own imprudence
and not in the least to the climate which being like themselves
thoroughly Bostonian was expected to maintain a proper degree of chill

Mary fortunately escaped colds and illness The walks in all sorts of
weather did her good and her rosy cheeks and clear eyes were competent
witnesses to her state of health She was getting on well with her
studies and the Misses Cabot not too easy to please were apparently
pleased with her At homefor she had come to consider Mrs Wyeths
comfortable house a home although not of course to be compared with the
real home at South Harnissat Mrs Wyeths she was more of a favorite
than ever not only with the mistress of the house but with Miss Pease
who was considered eccentric and whose liking was reported hard to win
The two ladies had many talks concerning the girl

She is remarkable declared Miss Pease on one occasion Considering
her lack of early advantages I consider her ease of manner and
selfpossession remarkable She is a prodigy

Mrs Wyeth sniffed She enjoyed hearing Mary praised but she objected
to her friends choice of words

For mercy sake Letitia she said dont call her that The word
prodigy always reminds me of the Crummles infant the one with the
green parasol and the whiteerlingerie in Nicholas Nickleby

Miss Pease smiled with the superiority of the corrected who is about to
correct

I dont see why that should bring the individual you mention to mind
she said If I remember correctlyand I was brought up on Dickensshe
was a phenomenon not a prodigy However it makes no material
difference what you and I call Mary Lathrop the fact remains that she
is an exceptionally wellbehaved goodmannered polite

Sweet healthy girl interrupted Mrs Wyeth finishing the sentence
I know that as well as you do Letitia Pease And you know I know
it Now what have you in your mind concerning Mary I know there is
something because you have been hinting at it for more than a week
What is it

Miss Pease looked wise

Oh I have a plan she said I cant tell even you Emily just what
it is as yet You see it isnt really a plan but only an idea so far
She doesnt know it herself of course

Hum Is it a pleasant planor idea whichever you call it That is
will she think it pleasant when she learns what it is

I certainly hope so

Look here Letitia with sudden suspicion you arent planning some
ridiculous sentimental nonsense for that child are you Youre not
trying to make a match for her I hope

Match What are you talking about If you mean am I trying to get her
married to some MAN with a scornful emphasis on the word I most
certainly am not

Humph Well if she ever is married I presume it will be to a man or
an imitation of one All right Letitia I am glad your great idea isnt
that whatever it is

It is not You know my opinion of marriage Emily Wyeth And so far
as matchmaking is concerned I should say you were a more likely subject
for suspicion That young relative of yours Sam Keith appears to be
coming here a great deal of late He MAY come solely to see you but I
doubt it

Mrs Wyeth smiled grimly

Samuel has been rather prevalent recently she admitted but dont
let that trouble you Letitia I have had my eye on the young man
Samuel is as susceptible to pretty girls as children are to the measles
And his attacks remind me of the measles as much as anything sudden
outbreak high fever and delirium then a general cooling off and a
rapid recovery This seizure isnt alarming and there is absolutely no
danger of contagion Mary doesnt take him seriously at all

And how about that other young manSmith I think his name is He has
called here twice since Christmas

Mrs Wyeth seemed to be losing patience

Well what of it she demanded

Why nothing that I know of except perhaps

There is no perhaps at all The Smith boy appears to be a very nice
young fellow and remarkably sensible for a young person in this
hoitytoity age From what I can learn his people although they
do live out Westdown in a mine or up on a branch or a ranch
or somethingare respectable Why shouldnt he call to see Mary
occasionally and why shouldnt she see him Goodness gracious What
sort of a world would this be if young people didnt see each other
Dont tell me that you never had any young male acquaintances when you
were a girl Letitia because I shant believe you

Miss Pease straightened in her chair

It is not likely that I shall make any such preposterous statement
she snapped

So the young male acquaintance called occasionallynot too
oftenMrs Wyeth saw to that probably not so often as he would
have liked but he did call and the acquaintanceship developed into
friendship That it might develop into something more than friendship
no one except possibly the sentimental Miss Pease seemed to suspect
Certainly Mary did not and at this time it is doubtful if Crawford did
either He liked Mary Lathrop She was a remarkably pretty girl but
unlike other pretty girls he had knownand as goodlooking college
football stars are privileged beyond the common herd he had known at
least severalshe did not flirt with him nor look admiringly up into
his eyes nor pronounce his jokes killingly funny nor flatter him in
any way If the jokes WERE funny she laughed a healthy genuine laugh
but if as sometimes happened they were rather feeble she was quite
likely to tell him so She did not always agree with his views having
views of her own on most subjects and if he asked her opinion the
answer he received was always honest if not precisely what he expected
or hoped

By George Youre frank at any rate he observed rather ruefully
after asking her opinion as to a point of conduct and receiving it
forthwith

Didnt you want me to be asked Mary You asked me what I thought you
should have done and I told you

Yes you did You certainly told me

Well didnt you want me to tell you

I dont know that I wanted you to tell me just that

But you asked me what I thought and that is exactly what I think
Dont YOU think it is what you should have done

Crawford hesitated then he laughed Why yes confound it I do he
admitted But I hoped you would tell me that what I did do was right

Whether I thought so or not

Whywelleryes Honestly now didnt you know I wanted you to say
the other thing

It was Marys turn to hesitate then she too laughed

Why yes I suppose she began and finished with Yes I did

Then why didnt you say it Most girls would

Perhaps that is why I judge that most girls of your acquaintance say
just about what you want them to Dont you think it is good for you to
be told the truth occasionally

It was good for him of course and incidentally it had the
fascination of novelty Here was a girl full of fun ready to take a
joke as well as give one neither flattering nor expecting flattery a
country girl who had kept store yet speaking of that phase of her life
quite as freely as she did of the fashionable Misses Cabots school
not at all ashamed to say she could not afford this or that simple and
unaffected but selfrespecting and proud a girl who was at all times
herself and retained her poise and common sense even in the presence of
handsome young demigod who had made two touchdowns against Yale

It was extremely good for Crawford Smith to know such a girl She helped
him to keep his feet on the ground and his head from swelling Not that
there was much danger of the latter happening for the head was a
pretty good one but Mary Lathrops common sense was a stimulatingand
fascinatingreenforcement to his own As he had said on the Sunday
afternoon of their first meeting in Boston it was a relief to have
someone to talk to who understood and appreciated a fellows serious
thoughts as well as the frivolous ones His approaching graduation from
Harvard and the work which he would begin at the Medical School in the
fall were very much in his mind just now He told Mary his plans and she
and he discussed them She had plans of her own principally concerning
what she meant to do to make life easier for her uncles when her school
days were over and these also were discussed

But he said thats really nonsense after all isnt it

What

Why the idea of your keeping store again Youll never do that

Indeed I shall Why not

Why because

Because what

Becausewell because I dont think you will thats all Girls like
you dont have to keep a country store you knowat least not for
long

The remark was intended to please it might have pleased some girls
but it did not please this one Marys dignity was offended Anything
approaching a slur upon her beloved uncles or their place of business
or South Harniss or the Cape Cod people she resented with all her
might Her eyes snapped

I do not HAVE to keep store at any time she said crisply in the
country or elsewhere I do it because I wish to and I shall continue to
do it as long as I choose If my friends do not understand that fact and
appreciate my reasons they are not my friends that is all

Crawford threw up both hands Whew he exclaimed Dont shoot Ill
come down Great Scott If you take a fellows head off like that when
he pays you a compliment what would you do if he dared to criticize

Was that remark of yours intended as a compliment

Not exactly more as a statement of fact I meantI meantOh come
now Mary You know perfectly well what I meant Own up

Mary tried hard to be solemn and severe but the twinkle in his eye was
infectious and in spite of her effort her lips twitched

Own up now persisted Crawford You know what I meant Now dont
you

Wellwell I suppose I do But I think the remark was a very silly
one That is the way Sam Keith talks

Eh Oh does he

Yes Or he would if I would let him And he does it much better than
you do

Well I like that

I dont That is why I dont want you to do it I expect you to be
more sensible And besides I wont have you or anyone making fun of my
uncles store

Making fun of it I should say not I have a vivid and most respectful
memory of it as you ought to know By the way you told me your uncles
had sent you their photographs May I see them

Mary brought the photographs from her room They had been taken by the
photographer at Ostable in compliance with what amounted to an order
on her part and the results showed two elderly martyrs dressed in
respectable but uncomfortable Sunday clothes and apparently awaiting
execution On the back of one mournful exhibit was written Mary
Augusta from Uncle Shadrach and on the other Uncle Zoeth to Mary
Augusta with much love

Now dont laugh commanded Mary as she handed the photographs to
Crawford I know they are funny but if you laugh Ill never forgive
you The poor dears had them taken expressly to please me and I am
perfectly sure either would have preferred having a tooth out They ARE
the best men in the world and I am more certain of it every day

Crawford did not laugh at the photographs He was a young gentleman of
considerable discretion and he did not smile not even at Captain Shads
hands the left with fingers separated and clutching a knee as if to
keep it from shaking the right laid woodenly upon a gorgeously bound
parlortable copy of Lucille Instead of laughing he praised the
originals of the pictures talked reminiscently of his own visit
in South Harniss and finally produced from his pocketbook a small
photographic print which he laid upon the table beside the others

I brought that to show you he said You were asking about my father
you know and I told you I hadnt a respectable photograph of him That
was true I havent Dad has another eccentricity besides his dislike of
the East and Eastern ways of living he has a perfect horror of having
his photograph taken Dont ask me why because I cant tell you It
isnt because he is ugly hes a mighty goodlooking man for his age if
I do say it But he has a prejudice against photographs of himself
and wont even permit me to take a snapshot if he can prevent it Says
people who are always having their pictures taken are vain conceited
idiots and so on However I catch him unawares occasionally and this
is a snap I took last summer He and I were on a fishing trip up in the
mountains Were great pals Dad and Imore than most fathers and sons
I imagine

Mary took the photograph and studied it with interest Mr Smith
senior was a big man broadshouldered and heavy with a full gray
beard and mustache He wore a broadbrimmed hat which shaded his
forehead somewhat but his eyes and the shape of his nose were like his
sons

Mary looked at the photograph and Crawford looked at her

Well what do you think of him asked the young man after an interval

Think repeated Mary absently still staring at the photograph Why
II dont know what you mean

I mean what is your opinion of my respected dad You must have one
by this time You generally have one on most subjects and youve been
looking at that picture for at least five minutes

Have I I beg your pardon I didnt realize The picture interested me
I have never seen your father have I No of course I havent But it
almost seems as if I had Perhaps I have seen someone who looks like
him

Shouldnt wonder Myself for instance

Of course That was stupid of me wasnt it He looks like an
interesting man one who has had experiences

He has Dad doesnt talk about himself much even to me but he had
some hard rubs before he reached the smooth places Had to fight his
way I guess

He looks as if he had But he got his way in the end I should imagine
He doesnt look like one who gives up easily

He isnt Pretty stubborn sometimes Dad is but a brick to me just
the same

Was your mother an Eastern woman

No She was a Westerner from California Dad was married twice His
first wife came from New England somewhere I believe I didnt know
there had been another wife until I was nearly fifteen years old and
then I found it out entirely by accident She was buried in another
town you see I saw her name first on the gravestone and it made an
impression on me because it was so odd and oldfashionedPatience
wife of Edwin Smith I only mention this to show you how little Dad
talks about himself but it was odd I should find it out that way
wasnt it But there I dont suppose youre interested in the Smith
genealogy I apologize I never think of discussing my family affairs
with anyone but you not even Sam But youwell somehow I seem to tell
you everything I wonder why

Perhaps because I ask too many questions

No it isnt that It is because you act as if you really cared to have
me talk about my own affairs I never met a girl before that did Now I
want to ask you about that club business Theres going to be the deuce
and all to pay in that if Im not careful Have you thought it over
What would you do if you were I

The matter in question was a somewhat delicate and complicated one
dealing with the admission or rejection of a certain fellow to one of
the Harvard societies There was a strong influence working to get him
in and on the other hand there were some very good objections to
his admission Crawford president of the club and one of its most
influential members was undecided what to do He had explained the
case to Mary upon the occasion of his most recent visit to the
Pinckney Street house and had asked her advice She had taken time
for consideration of courseshe was the old MaryGusta still in
thatand now the advice was ready

It seems to me she said that I should try to settle it like this

She explained her plan Crawford listened at first dubiously and then
with steadily growing enthusiasm

By George he exclaimed when she had finished That would do it I
honestly believe How in the world did you ever think of that scheme
Say you really are a wonder at managing You could manage a big
business and make it go Im sure How do you do it Where do you get
your ideas

Mary laughed His praise pleased her

I dont know she answered I just think them out I guess I do
like to manage things for people Sometimes I do it more than I should
perhaps Poor Isaiah Chase at home in South Harniss says I boss him to
death And my uncles say I manage them toobut they seem to like it
she added

I dont wonder they do I like it myself Will you help manage my
affairs between now and Commencement Therell be a whole lot to manage
between the club and the dance and all the rest of it And then when you
go to Commencement you can see for yourself how they work out

Go to Commencement Am I going to Commencement

Of course you are Youre going with me I hope I thought that was
understood Its a long way off yet but for goodness sake dont say
you wont come Ive been counting on it

Marys pleasure showed in her face All she said however was

Thank you very much I shall be very glad to come

But Commencement was as Crawford said still a good way off and in the
meantime there were weeks of study The weeks passed some of them and
then came the Easter vacation Mary spent the vacation in South Harniss
of course and as there was no Christmas rush to make her feel that
she was needed at the store she rested and drove and visited and had a
thoroughly happy and profitable holiday The happiness and profit were
shared by her uncles it is unnecessary to state When she questioned
them concerning business and the outlook for the coming summer they
seemed optimistic and cheerful

But Isaiah says there are two new stores to be opened in the village
this spring said Mary Dont you think they may hurt your trade a
little

Captain Shadrach dismissed the idea and his prospective competitors with
a condescending wave of the hand Not a mite he declared scornfully
Not a mite MaryGusta Hamilton and Companys a pretty able old
craft She may not show so much gilt paint and brass work as some of the
new ones just off the ways but her passengers know shes staunch and
theyll stick by her Why Isaiah was sayin that a feller was tellin
him only yesterday that it didnt make any difference how many new
stores was started in this town hed never trade anywheres but with
Hamilton and Company That shows you dont it

Who was it said that Uncle Shad asked Mary

Eh Why I dont know Isaiah was tellin me about it and we was
interrupted Who was it Isaiah

Twas Rastus Young replied Mr Chase promptly

Even the Captain was obliged to laugh although he declared that Mr
Youngs constancy was a proof that the firms prospects were good

Ratsll always leave a sinkin ship he said and if Zoeth and me was
goin under Rat Young would be the first to quit

Zoeth when his niece questioned him expressed confidence that the new
competitors would not prove dangerous The Almighty has looked after
us so far he added unworthy as we be and I guess hell carry us the
rest of the way Put your trust in Him MaryGusta I hope they teach
you that up to school

So Mary who had been rather troubled at the news of Hamilton and
Companys rivals in the field dismissed her fears as groundless Her
uncles were oldfashioned and a little behind the times in business
methods but no doubt those methods were suited to South Harniss and
there was no cause for worry concerning the firms future She made
Isaiah promise to keep her posted as to developments and went back to
Boston and her schoolwork




CHAPTER XIV


The spring term was an interesting one and there were other interests
as well Crawford called more frequently the plans for Commencement
requiring a great deal of discussion Marys fondness for managing was
or should have been gratified for the talent was in constant demand
Sam Keith who after meeting Mary at his cousins house had at first
developed an amazing fondness for that relatives society now came less
often He was in the second stage of the prettygirl disease mentioned
by his aunt the fever and delirium had passed and he was now cooling
off It cannot be said that the fever had been in the least encouraged
Mary was pleasant and agreeable when he called but she would not
treat him as a confidant or an intimate she did not accept any of his
invitations to dances or the theater and she would not flirt even the
least little bit The last was the most unsatisfactory drawback because
the susceptible Samuel was fond of flirtations and usually managed to
keep at least three going at the same time Therefore the coolingoff
process was in this case a bit more rapid than usual Sams calls and
dinners at his cousin Emilys residence had decreased from two or three
times a week to an uncertain once a fortnight Mary of course noticed
this but she felt no regret Crawford Sams roommate must have
noticed it also but if he felt regret he managed to conceal the feeling
remarkably well

Early in May Captain Shadrach came up to the city to buy summer goods
for the store He positively refused to make his headquarters at Mrs
Wyeths although that lady sent an urgent invitation to him to do so
And even when Mary added her own plea to that of her landlady the
Captain still refused


Dont ask me MaryGusta he wrote For the dear land sakes dont ask
me to come to that place and stay Id do most anything for you and I
will do that if you are dead sot on it but I do hope you aint I will
come up there and see you of course and Ill even stay to supper if I
get asked but DONT ask me to drop anchor and stay there night and day
I couldnt stand it My backbones sprung backwards now from settin up
so straight last time I was there


So Mary had pity upon him and he took a room at the Quincy House where
as he said he didnt have to keep his nose dead on the course every
minute but could lay to and be comftable if he wanted to He was
invited to supper at the Wyeth house however and while there Mrs
Wyeth found an opportunity to take him aside and talk with him on a
subject which he found interesting and a trifle disquieting

Now mind said the lady I am by no means convinced that the affair
is anything but a mere boy and girl friendship or that it is ever
likely to be more than that But I did think I ought to tell you about
it and that you should meet the young man You have met him you say

Yes maam said Shadrach Ive met him Twant much moren thathe
just came into our store down home thats all But I did meet him and I
must say I thought he was a real likely young feller

I am glad you thought so So do I Has Mary written you of his calls
here

Oh yes maam shes written She aint the kind of girl to keep
anything back from us at least if she is shes changed a heap since
she came away to school Shes told us about his comin here and about
you and him and her goin to thatwhatdyecallithookey game She
wrote all about that way last February

Yes we did go to the hockey game Samuel my cousin John Keiths boy
played in it Now Captain Gould I have a suggestion to make It has
been some years since you met Crawford Smith and I think everything
considered you should meet him again and decide for yourself whether
or not you still consider him a proper young person to call upon your
niece Suppose you dine with us again tomorrow evening and I invite
young Smith also Then

But the Captain interrupted He had a plan of his own for the following
evening and another meal at Mrs Wyeths was not a part of it

Ererexcuse me maam he cut in hastily but I had aa kind of
notion that MaryGusta and me might get our supper at aa eatinhouse
or somewhere tomorrow night and then maybe wed take inI mean go to
a showa theater I should say I didnt know but Id ask this young
Smith feller to go along Andand remembering his politeness of
course wed be real glad if youd come too he added

But Mrs Wyeth although she thanked him and expressed herself as
heartily in favor of the supper and theater party refused to become a
member of it The Captain bore the shock of the refusal with to say the
least manful resignation He had a huge respect for Mrs Wyeth and
he liked her because his beloved MaryGusta liked her so well but his
liking was seasoned with awe and her no in this case was a great relief

So the following evening at six Mary and her uncle met Crawford at the
Quincy House and the three dined together after which they saw the
performance of The Music Master at the Tremont Theater Crawford found
the dinner quite as entertaining as the play Captain Shadrach was in
high good humor and his remarks during the meal were characteristic
He persisted in addressing the dignified waiter as Steward and in
referring to the hotel kitchen as the galley He consulted his young
guests before ordering and accepted their selections gracefully if not
always silently

All right MaryGusta he observed All right just as you say
Youre the skipper of this craft tonight and me and Crawford here are
just passengers If you say weve got to eatwhat is itconsummer
soupwhy I suppose likely we have Ill take my chances if Crawford
will Course if I was alone here Id probably stick to oyster stew and
roast beef I know what they are And its some comfort to be sure of
what youre gettin as the sick feller said when the doctor told him he
had the smallpox instead of the measles You dont mind my callin you
Crawford do you he added turning to that young gentleman Im old
enough to be your father for one thing and for another a handles all
right on a jug or a sasspan but dont seem as if twas necessary to
take hold of a friends name by And I hope were goin to be friends
we three

Crawford said he hoped so too and he said it with emphasis

Good exclaimed the Captain with enthusiasm And well cement
the friendshipthe book fellers are always tellin about cementin
friendshipswith this supper of ours eh If we only had some of
Isaiahs last batch of mincemeat we could sartinly do it with that it
was the nighest thing to cement ever I saw put on a table I asked him
if he filled his pies with a trowel and you ought to have heard him
sputter You remember Isaiah dont you Crawford Tall spindlin
critter sails cook for Zoeth and me at the house down home He aint
pretty but his hearts in the right place Thats kind of strange
too he added with a chuckle when you consider how nigh his
shoulderblades are to the top of his legs

Between his stories and jokes he found time to ask his male guest a
few questions and these questions although by no means offensively
personal were to the point He inquired concerning the young mans home
life about his ambitions and plans for the future about his friends
and intimates at college Crawford without being in the least aware
that he was being catechized told a good deal and Captain Shadrachs
appraising regard which had learned to judge men afloat and ashore
read more than was told The appraisal was apparently satisfactory for
after the young man had gone and the Captain and Mary were saying good
night in the Wyeth parlor Shadrach said

A nice boy I should say Yes sir a real nice young feller as young
fellers go I like him fustrate

Im glad Uncle Shad said Mary I like him too

Shadrach regarded her with a little of the questioning scrutiny he had
devoted to Crawford during dinner

You do eh he mused How much

How much repeated Mary puzzled What do you mean

I mean how much do you like him Moren you do your Uncle Zoeth and me
for instance

She looked up into his face What she saw there brought the color to her
own He might have said more but she put her fingertips upon his lips

Nonsense she said hotly What wicked silly nonsense Uncle Shad
Dont you ever ever say such a thing to me again You KNOW better

Shadrach smiled and shook his head

All right MaryGusta he said I wont say it againnot till you
say it to me fust at any rate There there dearie Dont blow me
clean out of the water I was only jokin the same as Isaiah was tryin
to that night when you came home for your Christmas vacation

I dont like that kind of joking I think its silly

I guess maybe tisfor a spell anyhow Well heave the jokes
overboard Yes I like that Crawford Smith fustrate But the funniest
thing about him is the way he reminds me of somebody else Who that
somebody is I cant make out nor remember Maybe Ill think sometime or
other but anyhow I like him now for his own sake I asked him to come
down and see us sometime this summer Wonder if he will

MaryGusta wondered too but she would have wondered more had she
known what that coming summer was to mean to her The morning after the
theater party Captain Shadrach called to say goodby to Mrs Wyeth That
lady asked some questions and listened with interest and approval to his
report concerning Crawford Smith

Im glad you were so favorably impressed with the boy she said As I
told you I like him myself And you approve of his friendship with your
niece

The Captain rubbed his chin Why yes maam he said I approve
of that all right and I callate Zoeth would too Fact is where
MaryGustas concerned taint nothin BUT friendship so fur and I
guess likely taint on his part either If it ever should be more
thenwell then if he turned out to be all that hed ought to be I
cant see where we old folks have much right to put our oar in do you
maam

Perhaps Mrs Wyeth was tired of the subject perhaps she objected
to being addressed as one of the old folks at any rate she made no
answer but asked a question instead

Captain Gould she said what plans have you and Mr Hamilton made
for Mary this summer

Plans maam Why I dont knows weve made any Of course were
countin on her comin down to South Harniss when she gets through her
school and

Just a moment Captain I have a friend who is very anxious to have you
change that plan for one of hers Come in Letitia Captain Gould this
is my friend Miss Pease Now Letitia tell the Captain your planthe
one you told me last night

Miss Pease told of her plan and Captain Shad listened at first with
astonishment then with a troubled expression and at last with a
combination of both

There said Miss Pease in conclusion that is my plan It means a
great deal to me and I hope it may mean something to Mary

It will be a wonderful opportunity for her declared Mrs Wyeth
emphatically

What do you think of it Captain Gould asked Miss Pease

Shadrach drew a long breath II dont know hardly what to say
maam he answered I cant hardly realize it yet seems so It
sartinly would be a wonderful chance for her and its somethin me and
Zoeth could never give her or think of givin Butbut

Of course said Miss Pease as he hesitated if she is needed very
much at homeif you feel you cannot spare her

Taint that maam interrupted the Captain quickly Land knows
Zoeth and me would miss her awful but we wouldnt let that stand in the
waynot of anything like this Butbutwell to be right down honest
maam I dont knows wed feel like havin somebody else do so much
for her Course we aint well off Zoeth and I aint but we aint right
down poor either Weve been used to doin for ourselves and

And then Miss Pease had an inspiration

Oh dear me she broke in hastily I do hope you havent made a
mistake Captain Gould I hope you dont think I am offering this as a
charity or purely as a favor to Mary No indeed I am asking it as a
favor to myself I must have a companion otherwise I cannot go And
Mary is just the companion I need I am very fond of her and I think she
likes me I am not going to urge too much Captain Gould but I do hope
you will consider the matter with Mr Hamilton and let me hear from you
soon And I am hoping you will consent I promise to take good care of
your girl and bring her back safe and sound in September And I shall
not say one word of my great plan to her until you write me that I may

So Captain Shadrach the troubled expression still on his face returned
on the afternoon train to South Harniss to tell his friend and partner
of Miss Peases plan Mary who accompanied him to the Boston station
wondered why he seemed so preoccupied and quiet If she had known what
his thoughts were she would have wondered no longer

Miss Pease planned to travel through Europe during the summer months
and she had asked the Captains permission to take Mary with her as her
guest and friend and companion




CHAPTER XV


If time and space did not matter and if even more important happenings
in MaryGustas life were not as close at hand to claim attention it
would be interesting to describe at length those of that spring and the
summer which followed it Summarized in chronological order they were
these First the lengthy discussions between the partners concerning
Miss Peases plan discussions which ended by Zoeth as senior partner
writing Miss Pease


Shadrach and I say yes We ought to have said it afore but flesh is weak
and we found it kind of hard to make up our minds to spare our girl all
summer But we know we ought to spare her and that it will be a splendid
chance for her So we say she shall go and we thank you more than we can
say She will need clothes and fixings to take with her and Shadrach and
I wish to ask if you will be kind enough to help her pick out what she
needs Maybe Mrs Wyeth will help too It will be a great favor if you
two will do this Shadrach and I not being much good at such things We
will send the money and will pay for all


Then came the breaking of the news to Mary herself At first after
she could be made to believe the whole idea a perfectly serious one
and realized that a trip to Europeher dearest daydream even when a
little girl and the favorite play with the dolls in the attic at South
Harnisswhen she at last realized the opportunity that was hers even
then she hesitated to accept it There were her unclesthey needed her
so much in the storethey would miss her so dreadfully She could not
go and leave them The united efforts of Miss Pease and Mrs Wyeth could
not alter her determination to remain at home only a joint declaration
amounting to a command and signed by both partners of Hamilton and
Company had that effect She consented then but with reluctance

The steamer sailed from BostonMiss Peases civic loyalty forbade her
traveling on a New York boaton the thirtieth of June the week after
Commencement Mary and Mrs Wyeth attended the Commencement exercises
and festivities as Crawfords guest Edwin Smith Crawfords father did
not come on from Carson City to see his son receive his parchment from
his Alma Mater He had planned to comeCrawford had begun to believe he
might comebut at the last moment illness had prevented It was nothing
serious he wrote he would be well and hearty when the boy came West
after graduating


God bless you son the letter ended If you knew what it means for
your old dad to stay away youd forgive him for being in the doctors
care Come home quick when its over Theres a fourpound trout waiting
for one of us up in the lake country somewhere Its up to you or me to
get him


Crawford showed the letter to Mary He was disappointed but not so much
so as the girl expected

I never really dared to count on his coming he explained It has
been this way so many times Whenever Dad has planned to come East
something happens to prevent Now it has happened again I was almost
sure it would Its a shame I wanted you to meet him And I wanted him
to meet you too he added

Mary also was a little disappointed She had rather looked forward to
meeting Mr Smith He was her friends father of course and that of
itself made him an interesting personality but there was something
morea sort of mystery about him inspired in her mind by the
photograph which Crawford had shown her which made her curious The man
in the photograph resembled Crawford of course but she had the feeling
that he resembled someone else even moresomeone she had known or whose
picture she had seen She was sorry she was not to meet him

Commencement was a wonderful time Mary was introduced to dozens of
young fellows attended spreads and sings and proms danced a great
deal was asked to dance ever so much more chatted and laughed and
enjoyed herself as a healthy happy and pretty girl should enjoy a
college commencement And on the following Tuesday she and Miss Pease
looking down from the steamers deck waved their handkerchiefs to Mrs
Wyeth and Zoeth and Captain Shadrach and Crawford who standing on the
wharf waved theirs in return as the big ship moved slowly out of the
dock and turned her nose toward Minots Light and the open sea For the
first time since Hamilton and Company put up a sign both partners had
come to Boston together

Annabels keepin store explained Shadrach and Isaiahs helpin
Itll be the blind leadin the blind I callate but we dont care do
we Zoeth We made up our mind wed see you off MaryGusta if we had
to swim to Provincetown and send up skyrockets from Race Pint to let
you know we was there Dont forget what I told you If you should get
as fur as Leghorn be sure and hunt up that shipchandler name of Peroti
Ask him if he remembers Shad Gould that he knew in 65 If he aint dead
I bet you hell remember

So MaryGusta sailed away and for ten marvelous weeks daydreams came
true and attic makebelieves turned to realities War had not yet come
to sow its seed of steel and fire and reap its harvest of blood and
death upon the fair valleys and hills of France and the travelers
journeyed leisurely from village to cathedral town and from the Seine
to the Loire They spent three weeks in Switzerland and two in Italy
returning for the final week to London where under Miss Peases expert
guidance Mary visited the shops the big ones on Regent and Oxford
Streets and the smaller equally fascinatingand more expensiveones
on Bond Street and Piccadilly buying presents and remembrances for the
folks at home And at last came the day when leaning upon the rail
she saw the misty headlands of Ireland sink beneath the horizon and
realized that her wonderful holiday was over and that she was homeward
bound

The voyage was rather rough and stormy as westerly voyages are likely
to be but the ship was comfortable and speedy and they made good
time Mary spent but one day in Boston and on the morning of the next
started for South Harniss She had one week before school opened and
that week was to be spent with her uncles no one else she vowed
should have a minute of it

Great were the rejoicings in the white house by the shore that day and
marvelous was the dinner Isaiah served in honor of the occasion Mary
was obliged to relate the story of her trip from start to finish while
three rapt listeners nodded and exclaimed in sympathy or broke in to
ask questions She had written faithfully but as Isaiah said writin
aint tellin So Mary told and her uncles and Mr Chase listened and
questioned It was twelve oclock that night before anyone thought of
going to bed and next morning at the breakfast table the questioning
began all over again

Mrs Wyeth was down at the dock I presume likely to meet you when
your ship made port queried Zoeth

Yes she was there replied Mary

Anybody else How about that young Smith feller Want he there too
asked Captain Shadrach with elaborate innocence

Mary colored just a little She knew it was foolish there was no reason
in the world why she should be embarrassed but she could not help it

No Uncle Shad she answered He wasnt there He has not returned
from the West yet but he will be in Boston next week when the Medical
College opens

Been havin a good time out West there has he inquired the Captain
still with studied unconcern

Yes At least he writes me that he has She looked from one to the
other of her trio of listeners and then added I have some of his
letters here with me If youd like to hear them Ill read them aloud

No no you neednt do that protested Shadrach hastily But after
another look at him Mary said I think I will and departed in search
of the letters

Captain Shad looking a trifle guilty glanced at his partner

She neednt read em unless she wants to need she Zoeth he said
II didnt mean for her to do that

Mr Hamiltons face expressed doubt and disapproval

Humph he said and that was all

Mary returned bearing the packet of letters some of which she proceeded
to read Crawford had spent the summer either at his home in Carson
City or in camping with his father in the Sierras where he had shot and
fished and apparently enjoyed himself hugely The letters were frank
and straightforward full of fun and exuberance the sort of letters
a robust cleanminded young fellow ought to write and sometimes does
They were not sentimental even Isaiah with what Captain Shadrach
termed his lovesick imagination would not have called them so

The partners and Mr Chase listened with interest to the reading of the
letters and expressed their approval Shadrachs applause was loudest of
all but he seemed to find difficulty in meeting his nieces eye Just
before bedtime after Zoeth and Isaiah had gone upstairs and he
was locking up for the night Mary whom he supposed had gone also
reentered the diningroom and stood before him

Uncle Shad she said severely come here a minute and sit down I
want to talk with you

She led him to the big rocker Then she took the little one beside it

Now look me in the face she commanded No not out of the
windowhere Um    yes I dont wonder you turn red I should think
you might be ashamed

IIwhats that stammered Shadrach turning redder than ever What
do you mean Turnin red Whos turnin red

You are said the young lady firmly and you know it Now look me
straight in the eye Uncle Shad Gould dont you think it would have
been more honorable if you wished to know whether Crawford Smith and
I corresponded to have asked me instead of hinting Dont you think it
would

Hintin Whywhy MaryGusta whatwhat

His face was a study in expression Mary bit her lip but she managed to
appear solemn

Yes hinting she said Instead of asking if Crawford and I had
written each other you hinted Well now you know that we did write and
have heard his letters to me have you any objection

Objection No no course not WhyII think twas a fine thing II
like to get letters a heap better than I do to write em he added
truthfully

Then why

WellwellII

And arent you ashamed repeated Mary

Whywhy yes by the jumpin fire I am There I was ashamed when I
done it

Then why did you do it

Wellwell you see MaryGusta I just wanted to know Your Uncle
Zoeth and me have been actin as your pilots for a considerble spell
Course youre gettin big enough now to cruise on your own hookthat
is in reason you understandbutbutwell weve got so used to
takin an observation every noontime seein how youre layin your
course you know that its hard to lose the habit Not that Zoeth was
in on this he added honestly He didnt do any of the hintin as you
call it I imagine hell preach my head off for doin it when he gets
me alone

You deserve to have it preached offor partly off at any rate Do you
beg my pardon

Sartin sure Id beg it on my bended knees if twant for the
rheumatiz

And you wont hint any more

Nary a hint

Thats right If you want me to tell you anything please ask You must
trust me Uncle Shad I shall always tellwhen there is anything to
tell

I know you will MaryGusta Im ashamed of my hintin God bless you
dearie Now kiss me good night

He kissed her and holding her in his arms looked fondly down into her
eyes And as she returned his look suddenly she blushed crimson and
hid her face in his jacket Then she broke away and with a good night
ran from the room and up the stairs

Shadrach looked after her sighed and after finishing his locking up
went upstairs himself There was a light in his partners room and he
entered to find Mr Hamilton sitting at the little table with several
sheets of paper covered with figures spread out before him The Captain
was so busy with his own thoughts that for the moment he did not
notice the papers

Zoeth he said our MaryGustas changed into a grownup woman Even
this last summer has changed her She dont look any older and shes
prettier than ever but she thinks different and I have a notion that
no matter how much we may want to you and me aint goin to be able
to keep her to ourselves as weEh suddenly becoming aware of his
friends occupation Are you still fussin over those things Didnt I
tell you not to worry any more but to turn in and sleep

Zoeth shook his head His usually placid gentle face had lost some of
its placidity He looked worn and worried and the shadows thrown by
the lamp deepened the lines in his forehead He looked up over his
spectacles

Shadrach he said I cant help it I try not to worry and I try to
heave my burdens onto the Almighty same as were commanded but I cant
seem to heave the whole of em there If things dont pick up pretty
soon I dont knowI dont knowand I dont dare think he added
despairingly

The sheet of paper he was holding rattled as his hand shook Captain
Shad scowled

If we didnt have our winter goods to buy he muttered Our credits
good thats one comfort

It is up to now because the Boston folks dont know But WE know or
were afraid we know and that makes it worse How can we go on buyin
from folks that has stood our friends ever since we went into business
knowin as we do that

His partner interrupted

We dont know anything yet he declared Keep a stiff upper lip
Zoeth Nine chances to one well weather it all right WHAT a summer
this has been And when I think he added savagely of how well we got
along afore those new stores came it makes me nigh crazy Ill go out
with a card of matches some night and burn em down Damn pirates
Callin themselves good Cape Cod namesnames that dont belong to em
Bakers Bazaar Ugh Rheinsteins Robbers Roost would be nigher the
truth    Say Zoeth we mustnt hint a word to MaryGusta about
this Weve got cash enough on hand to pay her clearance charges up
there at school aint we

Yes Shadrach Ive looked out for that I dont knows Id ought to
The money maybe had ought to go somewheres else butbut right or wrong
its goin for her and I hope the Lordll forgive me And what you says
true she mustnt know were worried Shes so conscientious she might
be for givin up her schoolin and comin down here to help us Shed be
just as liable to do it as not

Youre right she would Good thing she thinks shes got money of her
own and that that money is payin her schoolin bills Shed be frettin
all the time about the expense if twant for that You and I must
pretend everythings lovely and the goose hangin high when shes
around And we mustnt let Isaiah drop any hints

No Isaiah has asked me two or three times lately if the new stores
was hurtin our trade I shouldnt wonder if he had some suspicions down
inside him

Umph Well thats all right so long as they stay inside If I see
signs of one of those suspicions risin above his Adams apple Ill
choke em down again Ill put a flea in Isaiahs ear and Ill put
mucilage on its feet sos twill stick there

So although Mary did notice that the two new shops in the village seemed
to be prospering and that business at Hamilton and Companys was
not rushing even for September the answers to her questions were so
reassuring that her uneasiness was driven away Her Uncle Zoeth evaded
direct reply and Captain Shadrach prevaricated wholeheartedly and
cheerfully Even Isaiah declared that everything and all hands was
doin fine But Mary made him promise that should it ever be otherwise
than fine he would write her immediately He gave the promise with some
reluctance

I callate if Capn Shad caught me tellin tales out of school hed go
to work and turn to and bust me over the head with a marlinespike said
Mr Chase with the air of one stating a fact

Mary laughed Oh no he wouldnt she declared Ill stand back of
you Isaiah Now mind you are to keep me posted on JUST how things are
here




CHAPTER XVI


Mary went back to Boston and to school where old acquaintances were
renewed and new ones made The Misses Cabot welcomed her with fussy and
dignified condescension Barbara Howe hugged and kissed her and vowed
she had not seen a girl all summer who was half so sweet

Why in the world someone doesnt run off with you and marry you this
very minute I cannot see declared the vivacious young lady If I were
a man I should

Mary who was used to Miss Howes outbursts merely smiled

Oh no you wouldnt she replied I should hope you would be more
sensible No one will run off with me at least I wouldnt run off with
them

Why not Dont you think an elopement is perfectly splendidso
romantic and all that Suppose you were head over heels in love with
someone and his people were dead set against his marrying you wouldnt
you elope then

I think I shouldnt I think I should try to find out why they were so
opposed to me Perhaps there might be some good reason If there were no
good reason thenwhy thenwell I dont know But I should hesitate
a long while before I came between a person and his family It must be
dreadful to do that

Barbara laughed Nonsense she cried Its done every day in the best
families my dear And then the reconciliation is all the sweeter You
just wait Some of these days I expect to read Elopement in South
Harniss High Life Beautiful Society Maiden Weds Famous Former
FootballererI want another FOh yes Famous Former Football
Favorite Isnt that beautiful Dear me how you blush Or is it
sunburn At any rate its very becoming

The Famous Former Football Favorite called at Mrs Wyeths on the
evening following that of Marys return to Boston He was as big and
brown as ever and declared that he had had a wonderful vacation

And youre looking awfully well too he exclaimed inspecting her
from head to foot She is isnt she Mrs Wyeth

Mrs Wyeth admitted that she thought so Crawford nodded emphatically

By George you are he repeated

There was no doubt of his sincerity In fact the admiration in his
voice and look was so obvious and unconcealed that Mary although
she could not help being pleased was a little embarrassed The
embarrassment wore away however when he began to tell of his summer
in the Sierras and to ask for additional particulars concerning her
European trip He stayed longer than usual that evening and came again
a few evenings laterto show them some photographs he had taken in
the mountains so he said And the following Sunday he dropped in to
accompany them to church Andbut why particularize Perhaps it will
be sufficient to say that during that fall and winter the boy and girl
friendship progressed as such friendships are likely to do Miss Pease
the romantic nodded and looked wise and even Mrs Wyeth no longer
resented her friends looks and insinuations with the same indignant
certainty of denial

I dont know Letitia she admitted I dont know Im beginning to
think he cares for her and may be really serious about it Whether or
not she cares for him is quite another thing and I am sure I shant
presume to guess If she does she keeps it to herself as she does so
many other things She knows how to mind her own business and that is a
gift possessed by few Letitia Pease

Mary went home for the Christmas vacation and spent the holidays as
she had spent those of the previous year in helping her uncles at the
store The Christmas trade although not so brisk as she had seen it
was not so bad as to alarm her and the partners were optimistic as
ever Isaiah who had been talked to like a Dutch uncle by Captain Shad
and was consequently in deadly fear of the latters wrath declared
that as far as he could see everything was all right So Mary left South
Harniss and returned to school and the duties of the winter term with
few misgivings concerning matters at home Crawford met her at the train
and came to the Pinckney Street house that evening to hear the news from
the Cape It was surprising the interest in Cape Cod matters manifested
of late by that young man

On a day in early April Mary hurrying to Mrs Wyeths after school
found a letter awaiting her She glanced at the postmark which was
South Harniss and the handwriting which was Isaiahs and then laid it
aside to be read later on at her leisure After many postponements and
with considerable reluctance she had accepted an invitation to dine with
Barbara Howe at the latters home in Brookline and this evening was the
time appointed It would be her first plunge into societythe home
life of society that is The Howes were an old family wealthy and
wellconnected and Mary could not help feeling somewhat nervous at
the ordeal before her She knew something of the number and variety
of expensive gowns possessed by her young hostess and her own limited
wardrobe seemed doubly limited and plain by comparison But she summoned
her unfailing common sense to her rescue and found consolation in the
fact that Barbara and her people knew she was comparatively speaking
a poor girl and therefore could hardly have invited her with the
expectation of seeing her arrayed in fine clothes And if they had done
sohere was a bit of the old MaryGusta philosophytheir opinion
was not worth consideration anyhow and the sooner they and she reached
mutual disgust and parting the better

But although her best gown was not new nor expensive and her jewels
were conspicuous by their absence the picture she made as she stood
before the mirror giving the last touches to her hair was distinctly not
an unpleasing one Maggie the maid who entered the room to announce a
caller was extravagant in her praises

Ah sure Miss you look fine she declared Youre that sweet one
look at you would sugar a cup of tea Ah hell be that proud of you and
he ought to be too But hes a fine young man and

Who What are you talking about Maggie interrupted Mary Who will
be proud of me and who is a fine young fellow

Who Why Mr Smith of course who else Hes down in the parlor
waitin for you now Ill tell him youll be down

Before Mary could stop her she had left the room and was on her way
downstairs Mary followed a moment later She had not expected a visit
from Crawford who had called already that week She wondered why he had
come

She found him in the parlor Mrs Wyeth was out shopping with Miss
Pease and he and she were alone He rose to meet her as she entered

Why Crawford she said what is the matter Has anything happened
Why do you look so serious

He smiled ruefully I guess because I am rather serious he answered
Ive had some news and I came to tell you about it Then noticing her
gown he added But youre going out arent you

I am going out by and by I am going to dine and spend the evening with
Barbara Howe But I am not going yet Wont you sit down

I will if youre sure you can spare the time I hope you can
becausewell because I do want to talk to you Ive had bad news from
home My father is illand in the doctors care

Oh Im so sorry I hope it isnt serious

I dont know whether it is or not It cant be desperately serious
because he wrote the letter himself But at any rate its serious enough
for me He wants me to give up my work here at the Harvard Medical and
come West

Mary gasped Give it up she repeated Give up your studies Give up
medicine Surely he doesnt want you to do that

Crawford shook his head No not quite that he replied I wouldnt
do that even for him But he writes that he is not well and is not
likely to be better for a good while if ever and he would be very much
happier if I were nearer at hand He wants me to give up here at the
Harvard Med and take up my work again at Denver or Salt Lake City or
somewhere out there Even Chicago would seem much nearer he says Its
a pitiful sort of letter The old chap seems dreadfully down in the
dumps He wants me thats plain enough and he seems to think he needs
me Says if I were at Denver I could come home every little while
whereas here I cant What ought I to do I hate to say no and I hate
just as much to say yes

Mary considered

I think you must decide for yourself she said after a moment You
have your career to consider of course

Yes I have But to be perfectly honest I suppose my career would
not be influenced greatly if I went There are plenty of good medical
colleges in the West It is only that I am a Harvard man and I hoped to
finish at the Harvard school that is all But I COULD go What do you
advise

Again Mary took time for consideration Her face now was as grave as
his At last she said without raising her eyes I think you ought to
go

He groaned I was afraid you would say that he admitted And I
suppose you are right

Yes I think I am If your father needs you and wants you and if your
career will not be influenced for harm Iwell I think you should do
as he wishes

And my own wishes shouldnt count I suppose

Why no not in this case not much at any rate Do you think they
should

Perhaps not Butbut yours

Mine

Yes Do YOU want me to go away He leaned forward in his chair and
repeated earnestly Do you Mary

She looked at him and her eyes fell before the look in his Her heart
began to beat quickly and she glanced apprehensively toward the partly
opened door He rose and closed it Then he came close to her

Mary he said earnestly do you know why this appeal of Dads has
hit me so very hard Why it is going to be so mighty difficult to say
yes and leave here It isnt because I hate to give up Harvard I do
hate that of course but Id do it in a minute for Dad It isnt that
Its because I cantI just cant think of leaving you You have come
to be

She interrupted Please dont she begged Please

He went on unheeding

You have come to mean about all there is in life for me he declared
It isnt money or success or reputation Ive been working and plugging
for these last few months its just you I didnt think so onceI used
to think such things were just in booksbut now I know I love you
Mary

Again she protested Oh Crawford she begged please

No youve got to hear me Its true I love you and if you can care
for me I am going to marry you Not now of course Ive got my way to
make first but some day if I live

His teeth set in the determined fashion she had learned to know meant
unswerving purpose She looked up saw the expression of his face and
for the instant forgot everything except her pride in him and her joy
that she should have awakened such feelings Then she remembered other
things things which she had spent many hours of many nights in debating
and considering As he bent toward her she evaded him and rose

Dont Crawford Please she said again You mustnt say such things
to me It isnt right that you should

He looked puzzled Why not he asked At any rate right or wrong I
must say them Mary Ive been holding them in for months and now Ive
just got to say them I love you and I want to marry you May I

Oh no Crawford No It is impossible

Impossible Why Is itis it because you dont care for me Dont you
Mary

She did not answer

Dont you he repeated Look at me Cant you care Mary

She was silent But when he took a step toward her she raised her hands
in protest

Please dont she pleaded No you mustntwe mustnt thinkOh no
it is impossible

It isnt impossible If you love me as I do you it is the only possible
thing in the world Listen dear

Hush I mustnt listen Be sensible Crawford think We are both so
young You are only beginning your studies It will be years before you
canbefore you should consider marrying

But we can wait I am willing to wait if you will only promise to wait
for me Ill workHOW Ill workand

I know but we both have others besides ourselves to consider I have
my uncles They have done everything for me And you have your father
Does he knowabout meabout what you have just said to me

And now Crawford hesitated Not long but long enough for Mary to know
what the answer would be before it was spoken

He doesnt know she said I thought not Do you think he will
approve

I hope he will There is every reason why he should and absolutely none
why he shouldnt Of course hell approve hes sensible

Yes but he may have plans of his own for you and your marrying
an Eastern girl may not be one of them You have often told me how
prejudiced he is against the East and Eastern people He may disapprove
strongly

Crawford squared his shoulders There was no hesitation or doubt in his
next speech

If he does it will make no difference he declared I care a whole
lot for Dad and Id do anything on earth for himanything but the one
thing that is I wont give you upprovided you care for mefor him
or for anyone else Thats final

He certainly looked as if it were But Mary only shook her head In the
new thoughts and new imaginings which had come to her during the past
winter there had been a vague foreshadowing of a possible situation
somewhat like this She had her answer ready

Oh no it isnt she said You are his son his only child
Crawford He cares so much for you You have often told me that
andand I know he must And you and he have been so happy together Do
you think I would be the cause of breaking that relationship

He waved the question aside and asked one of his own

Do you love me Mary he asked

You mustnt ask me Crawford Write your father Tell him everything
Will you

Yes I will I should have done it anyway If I go home and I suppose
I must I shall tell him it will be better than writing But I want
your answer before I go Wont you give it to me

He looked very handsome and very manly as he stood there pleading But
Mary had made up her mind

I cant Crawford she said Perhaps I dont know I do know that it
would not be right for me to say what you want me to saynow Go home
to your father he needs you Tell him everything and thenwrite me

He looked at her a long long look Then he nodded slowly

All right he said I will I will tell him that I mean to marry you
If he says yesas he will Im surethen Ill write you that If he
says no Ill write you that But in either case Mary Lathrop I shall
marry you just the same Your own no will be the only thing that can
prevent it And now may I come and see you tomorrow evening

Not tomorrow Crawford When will you start for home

Saturday I think May I come the day after tomorrow Just to say
goodby you know

Mary was troubled She could not deny him and yet she was certain it
would be better for them both if he did not come

Perhaps she said doubtfully But only to say goodby You must
promise that

There was a ring at the bell Then Maggie the maid appeared to
announce that the Howe motor car was waiting at the curb A few moments
later Mary was in her room adjusting her new hat before the mirror
Ordinarily adjusting that hat would have been an absorbing and
painstaking performance just now it was done with scarcely a thought
How devoutly she wished that the Howe car and the Howe dinner were
waiting for anyone in the wide world but her She did not wish to meet
strangers she did not wish to go anywhere above all she did not wish
to eat That evening of all evenings in her life she wished to be
alone However accepted invitations are implied obligations and Mary
having adjusted the hat gave her eyes a final dab with a handkerchief
and cold water and hastened down to answer the call to social martyrdom

It was not excruciating torture that dinner in the Howe diningroom
even to a young lady who had just listened to a proposal of marriage and
desired to think of nothing less important Mr Howe was big and jolly
Mrs Howe was grayhaired and gracious and Barbara wasBarbara Also
there was a friend of Mr Howes an elderly gentleman named Green who
it seemed was one of a firm of wholesale grocers downtown and who
told funny stories and by way of proving that they were funny laughed
heartiest of all at the ending of each He sat next Mrs Howe during
dinner but later when they were all in the handsome drawingroom he
came over and seated himself upon the sofa next Mary and entered into
conversation with her

You are not a born Bostonian I understand Miss Lathrop he observed
An importation eh Ho ho Yes Well how do you like us

Mary smiled Oh I like Boston very much Mr Green she answered I
know it better than any other American city perhaps that is why It was
the only city I had ever seen until quite recently I am importedas
you call itfrom not so far away My home is on Cape Cod

Mr Green regarded her with interest

So he said From Cape Cod eh Thats rather peculiar I have been
very much interested in the Cape for the past day or so Something has
occurred in connection with my business which brought the Cape to mind
My attention has beeneras you may say gripped by the strong right
arm of Massachusetts Eh Ho ho

He chuckled at his own joke Mary was rather bored but she tried not to
show it

What part of the Cape has interested you Mr Green she inquired for
the sake of saying something

Eh OherSouth Harniss Little town down near the elbow Do you know
it

Mary was surprised of course The answer which was on the tip of her
tongue was naturally Why yes I live there But she did not make
that answer although she has often wondered since why What she said
was Yes I know South Harniss

Do you indeed went on Green Well I dont but I have known some
people who live there for ever so long My father knew them before me
They were customers of his and they have been buying of our firm for
years Two old chaps who keep what I believe they would call a general
store Fine old fellows both of them Different as can be and
characters but pure gold inside I have had some bad news concerning
them Theyre in trouble and Im mighty sorry

Mary was bored no longer She leaned forward and asked breathlessly

What are their names Mr Green

Eh Oh the firm name is Hamilton and Company That is simple and sane
enough but the names of the partners were cribbed from the book of
Leviticus I should imagineZoeth and Shadrach Ho ho Think of it
Think of wishing a name like Shadrach upon a helpless infant The S P
C A or C C or something ought to be told of it Ho ho

He laughed aloud Mary did not laugh

Theyyou said they were in trouble she said slowly What sort of
trouble

Eh Oh the usual kind The kind of goblin young lady which is likely
to get us business men if we dont watch outfinancial trouble The
firm of Hamilton and Company has not kept abreast of the times thats
all For years they did a good business and then some new competitors
with uptodate ideas came to town andpuffgoodby to the old
fogies They are in a bad way Im afraid and will have to go under
unlesseh But there you arent particularly interested I dare say
It was your mention of Cape Cod which set me going

Oh but I am interested I am really They must go under you say
Fail do you mean

Yes that is what I mean I am very sorry Our firm would go on
selling them goods almost indefinitely for as I have said they are old
customers and in a way old friends But they are absolutely honest and
they will not buy what they cannot pay for We have some pitiful letters
from themnot whining you know but straightforward and frank They
dont ask favors but tell us just where they stand and leave it to us
to refuse credit if we see fit It is just one of the little tragedies
of life Miss Lathrop but Im mighty sorry for those two old friends of
my fathers and mine And the worst of it is that from inquiries I
have made it would seem that they have been sacrificing themselves by
spending their money lavishly and uselessly on someone else They have a
girl in the family a sort of adopted niece whatever that is and not
content with bringing her up like a sensible respectable country girl
they must dress her like a millionaires daughter and send her off to
some extravagantly expensive seminary whereWhy what is the matter
Eh Good heavens What have I been saying You dont know these people
do you

Mary turned a very white face toward his

They are my uncles she said My home is at South Harniss Please
excuse me Mr Green

She rose and walked away A few minutes later when Mr Howe approached
the sofa he found his friend sitting thereon staring at nothing in
particular and fervently repeating under his breath The devil The
devil The devil

Mary got away as soon as she could Her looks attracted Barbaras
attention and the young lady asked if she were not feeling well Mary
replied that she was not and although it was not serious please might
she be permitted to go home at once She was sent home in the automobile
and when she reached her own room her first act was to find and open
Isaiahs letter which had arrived that afternoon With trembling fingers
she held it beneath the gas jet and this is what she read


DEAR MARY AUGUSTA

I had not ought to write you this and your Uncles would pretty nigh kill
me if they knew I done so but I am going to just the same Busines has
gone to rack and ruin Hamilton  Co thanks to those and other darned
stores aint making enough to keep boddy and soul together and they are
making themselves sick over it I dont know what will become of them to
if something or someboddy does not think up some way to help them over
the shoals They do not tell anyone and least of all they wouldent want
you to be told but I think you ought to be They have done a whole lot
for you Cant you think up some way to do something for them For god
Sakes write right off

Yours truly

ISAIAH CHASE





CHAPTER XVII


People grow older even on the Cape where hurryexcept by the
automobiles of summer residentsis not considered good form and where
Father Time is supposed to sit down to rest Judge Baxter Ostables
leading attorneyatlaw had lived quietly and comfortably during the
years which had passed since as Marcellus Halls lawyer he read the
astonishing letter to the partners of Hamilton and Company He was over
seventy now and behind his back Ostable folks referred to him as old
Judge Baxter but although his spectacles were stronger than at that
time his mental faculties were not perceptibly weaker and he walked
with as firm if not so rapid a stride So when at eleven in the
forenoon of the day following Marys dinner at the Howes home the
Judge heard someone enter the outer room of his offices near the Ostable
courthouse he rose from his chair in the inner room and without
waiting for his clerk to announce the visitor opened the door himself

The caller whose question the clerk was about to answer or would
probably have answered as soon as he finished staring in awestruck
admiration was a young lady The Judge looked at her over his
spectacles and then through them and decided that she was a stranger He
stepped forward

I am Judge Baxter he said Did you wish to see me

She turned toward him Yes she said simply I should like to talk
with you for a few moments if you are not too busy

The Judge hesitated momentarily Only the week before a persistent and
fluent young female had talked him into the purchase of a set of
Lives of the Great Jurists the same to be paid for in thirtyfive
installments of two dollars each Mrs Baxter had pronounced the Great
Jurists great humbugs and her husband although he pretended to find
the Lives very interesting was secretly inclined to agree with her
So he hesitated The young woman evidently noticing his hesitation
added

If you are engaged just now I shall wait I came to see you on a matter
of business legal business

Judge Baxter tried to look as if no thought of his visitors having
another purpose had entered his mind

Oh yes certainly Of course he said hastily and added Will you
walk in

She walked into the private office that isand the Judge following
her closed the door His clerk stared wistfully at his own side of that
door for a full minute then sighed heavily and resumed his work which
was copying a list of household effects belonging to a late lamented who
had willed them separately and individually to goodness knew how many
cousins first second and third

In the private office the Judge asked his visitor to be seated She took
the chair he brought forward Then she said

You dont remember me I think Judge Baxter I am Mary Lathrop

The Judge looked puzzled The name sounded familiar but he could not
seem to identify its owner

Perhaps you would remember me if I told you my whole name suggested
the latter I am Mary Augusta Lathrop I think perhaps you used to call
me MaryGusta most people did

Then the Judge remembered His astonishment was great

MaryGusta Lathrop he repeated MaryGusta Are you Why it
scarcely seems possible And yet now that I look I can see that it is
Bless my soul and body How do you do It must be almosterseven or
eight years since I have seen you South Harniss is only a few miles
off but I am gettingerolder and I dont drive as much as I used to
But there I am very glad to see you now And how are Captain Gould and
Mr Hamilton There is no need to ask how you are Your looks are the
best answer to that

Mary thanked him and said she was very well Her uncles too were well
she added or they were when she last heard

I am on my way home to them now she added For the past two years I
have been at school in Boston I left there this morning and got off
the train here because I wished very much to see you Judge Baxter
Yesterdaylast eveningI heard somethingI was told something which
if it is true isis

She bit her lip She was evidently fighting desperately not to lose
selfcontrol The Judge was surprised and disturbed

Why Mary he exclaimed I suppose I may call you Mary still as an
old friend I hope I may What is the matter What did you hear What do
you wish to see me about

She was calm enough now but her earnestness was unmistakable

I heard something concerning myself and my uncles which surprised and
shocked me dreadfully she said I can hardly believe it but I must
know whether it is true or not I must know at once You can tell me
the truth Judge Baxter if you only will That is why I came here this
morning Will you tell it to me Will you promise that you will answer
my questions every one with the exact truth and nothing else And
answer them all Will you promise that

The Judge looked even more surprised and puzzled He rubbed his chin and
smiled doubtfully

Well Mary he said I think I can promise that if I answer your
questions at all I shall answer them truthfully But I scarcely like
to promise to answer them without knowing what they are A lawyer has a
good many secrets intrusted to him and he is obliged to be careful

I know But this is a secret in which I am interested I am interested
in it more than anyone else I must know the truth about it I MUST If
you wont tell me I shall find out somehow WILL you tell

Judge Baxter rubbed his chin again

Dont you think you had better ask your questions he suggested

Yes yes I do I will How much money did my stepfather Captain
Marcellus Hall have when he died

The Judges chinrubbing ceased His eyebrows drew together

Why do you want to know he asked after a moment

Because I do Because it is very important that I should It is my
right to know Was he a rich man

Umerno I should not call him that Hardly a rich man

Was he very poor

Mary I dont exactly see why

I do Oh Judge Baxter please dont think I am asking this for any
selfish reasons I am not indeed Im not All my life ever since I was
old enough to think of such things at all I have supposedI have been
led to believe that my stepfather left me plenty of moneymoney enough
to pay my uncles for taking care of me for my clothes and board and
now during these last two years for my studies in Boston I never
never should have consented to go to that school if I hadnt supposed I
was paying the expenses myself I knew my uncles were not welltodo I
knew they could not afford toto do what they had already done for me
even before that And nowlast nightI was told thatthat they were
in great financial trouble that they would probably be obliged to fail
in business and all because they had been spending their money on me
sacrificing themselves and their comfort and happiness in order that
an adopted niece with extravagant ideas might be educated above her
station that is the way the gentleman who told me the story put it Of
course he didnt know he was talking to the niece she added with a
pathetic little smile but oh Judge cant you see now why I must
know the truthall of the truth

Her fingers clasped and unclasped in her lap The Judge laid his own
hand upon them

There there my dear he said soothingly Tut tut tut Whats all
this about your uncles failing in business That isnt possible is it
Tell me the whole thing just as it was told to you

So Mary told it concluding by exhibiting Isaiah Chases letter

It must be very bad you see she said Isaiah never would have
written if it had not been It is hard enough to think that while I was
enjoying myself in Europe and at school they were in such trouble and
keeping it all to themselves That is hard enough when I know how
they must have needed me But if it should be true that it is
their moneymoney they could not possibly sparethat I have been
spendingwasting there in Boston IIPlease tell me Judge Baxter
Have I any money of my own Please tell me

The Judge rose and walked up and down the floor his brows drawn
together and his right hand slapping his leg at each turn After seven
or eight of these turns he sat down again and faced his caller

Mary he said suppose this story about your uncles financial and
business troubles should be true what will you do

Mary met his look bravely Her eyes were moist but there was no
hesitation in her reply

I shall stay at home and help them in any way I can she said There
will be no more Boston and no more school for me They need me there at
home and I am going hometo stay

Whether it is your money or theirs which has paid for your education

Certainly Of course I never should have gone away at all if I had
not supposed my own money were paying the expenses Judge you havent
answered my questionand yet I thinkI am afraid that you have
answered it It was their money that paid wasnt it

Judge Baxter was silent for a moment as if in final deliberation Then
he nodded solemnly

Yes Mary he said it was their money In fact it has been their
money which has paid for most things in your life Shadrach Gould and
Zoeth Hamilton arent maybe the best business men in the world but
they come pretty near to being the best MEN in business or out of
it that I have met during seventy odd years on this planet I think
perhaps it will be well for you to know just how good they have been to
you Now listen

He began at the beginning at the day of Marcellus Halls funeral
when he read the letter to Shadrach and Zoeth the letter intrusting
MaryGusta to their care He told of Marcelluss unfortunate
investments of the loss of the latters fortune and how when the
estate was settled there were but a few hundreds where it was expected
there might be a good many thousands

Dont make any mistake Mary he said earnestly Your uncles knew
there was little or no money when they decided to take you They took
you simply for yourself because they cared so much for you not because
they were to make a cent from the guardianship Everything you have
had for the past two years their money has paid for and you may be
absolutely certain they never have grudged a penny of it The last time
I saw Captain Gould he was glorying in having the smartest and best girl
in Ostable County And Mr Hamilton

She interrupted him Dont please she said chokingly Please dont
tell me any more just now II want to think

There isnt any more to tell he said gently I am going into the
next room I shall be back in a few minutes Then if you care to we
can talk a little more

When he returned she had risen and was standing by the window looking
out into the back yard She was calm and even smiled a little as he
entered although the smile was a rather pitiful one Of the two the
Judge looked the more perturbed

Whew he exclaimed after carefully closing the door behind him Ive
been doing a little thinking my self young lady since I left you here
Ive been thinking that I had better take a trip to Canada or China or
somewhere and start in a hurry too When your uncles find out that I
told you this thing they have succeeded in keeping from you all this
timewell it will be high time for me to be somewhere else He
laughed and then added gravely But I still think I was right in
telling you Under the circumstances it seems to me that you should
know

Of course I should If you had not told me I should have found it out
now that my suspicions were aroused Thank you Judge Baxter Now I must
go

Go Go where

Hometo South Harniss

Nonsense Youre not going to South Harniss yet awhile Youre going to
have dinner with my wife and me

Thank you I cant I must go at once By the next train

There isnt any train until nearly four oclock Then noticing her
look of disappointment he went on to say But that shant make any
difference Ill send you over in my nephews automobile Im not
sufficiently uptodate to own one of the cussedexcuse me things but
he does and I borrow it occasionally I dont drive it good heavens
no But his man shall drive you over and Ill guarantee you beat the
train If you dont it wont be because you go too slow Now of
course youll stay to dinner

But Mary shook her head Youre very kind Judge she said and I
thank you very much but

Well but what

But II cant IIOh dont you see I couldnt eat or even try
tonow I want to get hometo them

And so you shall my dear And in doublequick time too Here Jesse
opening the door to the outer office and addressing the clerk you
step over and tell Samuel that I want to borrow his car and Jim for two
hours Tell him I want them now And if his car is busy go to Cahoons
garage and hire one with a driver Hurry

And now Mary turning to her can you tell me any more about your
plans provided you have had time to make any If this story about your
uncles business troubles is true what do you intend doing Or dont
you know

Mary replied that her plans were very indefinite as yet

I have some ideas she said some that I had thought I might use
after I had finished school and come back to the store They may not
be worth much they were schemes for building up the business there and
adding some other sorts of business to it The first thing I shall do is
to see how bad the situation really is

I hope it isnt bad Poor Zoeth certainly has had trouble enough in his
life

There was a significance in his tone which Mary plainly did not
understand

What trouble do you mean she asked

The Judge looked at her coughed and then said hastily Oh nothing in
particular every one of us has troubles I suppose But Mary ifif
you find that the story is true andahema little money might help
toertide the firm overwhy II think perhaps that it might
beahemarranged so that

He seemed to be having difficulty in finishing the sentence Mary did
not wait to hear the end

Thank you Judge she said quickly Thank you but I am hoping it may
not be so bad as that I am going back there you know andwell as
Uncle Shadrach would say we may save the ship yet At any rate we
wont call for help until the last minute

Judge Baxter regarded her with admiration

Shadrach and Zoeth are rich in one respect he declared theyve got
you But it is a wicked shame that you must give up your school and your
opportunities to

She held up her hand

Please dont she begged If you knew how glad I am to be able to do
something if it is only to give up

The car and Jim were at the door a few minutes later and Mary having
said goodby to the Judge and promised faithfully to keep him posted as
to events at home climbed into the tonneau and was whizzed away Jim
the driver after a few attempts at conversation mainly concerning the
unseasonableness of the weather finding responses few and absently
given relapsed into silence Silence was what Mary desired silence and
speed and Jim obliged with the latter

Over the road by which a dozen years before she had driven in the old
buggy she now rode again Then as now she wondered what she should
find at her journeys end Here however the resemblance ceased
for whereas then she looked forward with a childs anticipations to
nothing more definite than new sights and new and excitingly delightful
adventures now she saw aheadwhat Great care and anxiety and
trouble certainly these at the best and at the worst failure
and disappointment and heartbreak And behind her she was leaving
opportunity and the pleasant school life and friends leaving them
forever

She was leaving Crawford too leaving him without a word of
explanation She had had no time to write even a note Mrs Wyeth after
protesting vainly against her guests decision to leave for the Cape by
the earliest train in the morning had helped to pack a few essential
belongings the others she was to pack and send later on when she
received word to do so The three Mrs Wyeth Miss Pease and Mary had
talked and argued and planned until almost daylight Then followed an
hour or two of uneasy sleep a hurried breakfast and the rush to the
train Mary had not written Crawford the shock of what she had been
told at the Howes and her great anxiety to see Judge Baxter and learn
if what she had heard was true had driven even her own love story from
her mind Now she remembered that she had given him permission to call
not this evening but the next to say goodby before leaving for the
West He would be disappointed poor fellow Well she must not think of
that She must not permit herself to think of anyone but her uncles or
of anything except the great debt of love and gratitude she owed them
and of the sacrifice they had made for her She could repay a little of
that sacrifice now at least she could try She would think of that and
of nothing else

And then she wondered what Crawford would think or say when he found she
had gone




CHAPTER XVIII


The main street of South Harniss looked natural enough as the motor car
buzzed along it It was but a few months since Mary had been there
yet it seemed ever so much more She felt so much older than on those
Christmas holidays When the store of Hamilton and Company came in sight
she sank down on the back seat in order not to be seen She knew her
uncles were in all probability there at the store and she wished to
see Isaiah and talk with him before meeting them

Isaiah was in the kitchen by the cookstove when she opened the door He
turned saw her and stood petrified Mary entered and closed the door
behind her By that time Mr Chase had recovered sufficiently from his
ossification to speak

Ehehby time he gasped I snum if it aint you

Mary nodded Isaiah she asked quickly are you alone Are my uncles
both of them at the store

But the cook and steward had not yet completely got over the effect of
the surprise He still stared at her

It IS you aint it he stammered IIby time I do believe youve
come home same as I asked you to

Of course Ive come home How in the world could I be here if I
hadnt DONT stare at me like that with your mouth open like alike a
codfish Tell me are Uncle Shad and Uncle Zoeth at the store

EhYes I callate they be Aint neither of em come home to dinner
yet Im expectin one of em most any minute Ill run up and fetch
em Say How in the nation did you get here this time of day

I shall tell you by and by No I dont want you to get my uncles I
want to talk with you alone first Now Isaiah sit down Sit down
in that chair I want you to tell me just how bad things are Tell me
everything all you know about it and dont try to make the situation
better than it is And please HURRY

Isaiah bewildered but obedient sat down The command to hurry had the
effect of making him so nervous that although he talked enough to have
described the most complicated situation his ideas were badly snarled
and Mary had to keep interrupting in order to untangle them And after
all what he had to tell was not very definite Business was bad at the
store that was plain to everyone in town All hands were trading
at the new stores where prices were lower stocks bigger and more
uptodate and selling methods far far in advance of those of Hamilton
and Company

About the only customers that stick by us declared Isaiah are folks
like Rastus Young and the rest of the deadbeats THEY wouldnt leave us
for nothinand nothins what they pay too drat em

The partners had not told him of their troubles but telling was not
necessary He had seen and heard enough

They are right on the ragged edge of goin on the rocks vowed Isaiah
Zoeth hes that thin and peaked twould make a sick pullet look fleshy
alongside of him And Capn Shad goes around with his hands rammed down
in his beckets

In his what

In his britches pockets and he dont scurcely speak a word for hours
at a stretch And theyre up all times of the night fussin over
account books and writin letters and I dont know what all Its plain
enough whats comin Everybody in town is on to it Why I was up to
the store tother day settin outside on the steps and Ab Bacheldor came
along He hates Capn Shad worsen pizen you know Hello Isaiah he
says to me he says Is that you he says Course its me says I
Whod you think twas I didnt know but it might be the sheriff
he says I understand hes settin round nowadays just awaitin And
Zoeth was right within hearin too

Oh exclaimed Mary indignantly

Yup thats what he said went on Isaiah But I got in one dig on my
own hook The sheriff dont wait much down to your house Abner does
he says I You bet he dont says he he dont have to Well
hed starve to death if he waited there long says I Ho ho His
wifes the stingiest woman about her cookin that there is on the Cape
Why one time she took a notion shed keep boarders and Henry Ryder
that drives the fruit cart he started to board there But he only
stayed two days The fust day they had biled eggs and the next day
they had soup made out of the shells Course that probably aint
trueHenrys an awful liarbut all the same

Never mind Henry Ryder or Abner Bacheldor either interrupted Mary
How did you happen to send for me Isaiah

Eh Oh that just came of itself as you might say I kept gettin more
and more tittered up and worried as I see how things was goin and I
kept wishin you was here if twas only to have somebody to talk it
over with But I didnt dast to write and when you was home Christmas I
never dast to say nothin because Capn Shad had vowed hed butcher me
if I told tales to you about any home troubles Thats it you see All
through this their main idea has been not to trouble you She mustnt
know anything or shell worry says Zoeth and Capn Shad he says
Thats so They think an awful sight of you MaryGusta

Mary did not trust herself to look up

I know she said Go on Isaiah

Well I kept thinkin and thinkin and one day last week Ezra Hopkins
thats the butcher cart feller he and me was talkin and he says
Trade aint very brisk up to the store is it he says Everybody
says taint Then if everybody knows so much what dye ask me for
says I Oh dont get mad says he But I tell you this Isaiah
he says if MaryGusta Lathrop hadnt gone away to that fool Boston
school things would have been different with Hamilton and Company Shes
a smart girl and a smart business woman I believe shed have saved the
old fellers he says She was uptodate and she had the knowhow
says he Well I kept thinkin what he said andandwell I wrote For
the land sakes dont tell Shad nor Zoeth that I wrote but Im glad I
done it I dont knows you can do anything I dont knows anybody can
but Im mighty glad youre here MaryGusta

Mary sighed Im glad I am here too Isaiah she agreed although I
too dont know that I can do anything But she added solemnly I
am going to try very hard Now we mustnt let Uncle Shad or Uncle Zoeth
know that I have heard about their trouble We must let them think I am
at home for an extra holiday Then I shall be able to look things over
and perhaps plan a little When I am ready to tell what I mean to do I
can tell the rest    Sshh Here comes one of them now Its Uncle
Zoeth Look happy Isaiah HAPPYnot as if you were choking to death
Well Uncle Zoeth arent you surprised to see me

Surprised he certainly was at first like Isaiah he could scarcely
believe she was really there Then naturally he wished to know WHY
she was there She dodged the questions as best she could and Zoeth
innocent and truthful as always accepted without a suspicion her vague
explanation concerning an opportunity to run down and see them for a
little while Dinner was put on the table and then Isaiah hastened up to
relieve Shadrach at the store in order that the partners and Mary might
eat together

The Captain arrived a few minutes later redfaced vociferous and
joyful

Well he shouted throwing his arms about her and kissing her with a
smack which might have been heard in Abner Bacheldors yard if THIS
aint a surprise Zoeth said this mornin he felt as if somethin was
goin to happen and then Isaiah upset the tea kittle all over both my
feet and I said I felt as if it HAD happened But it hadnt had it
Well if it aint good to look at you MaryGusta Howd you happen to
come this time of year Has the schoolhouse foundered

Mary repeated the excuse she had given Mr Hamilton It was sufficient
The partners were too happy at having her with them to be overcurious
concerning her reasons for coming Captain Shad talked and joked and
laughed and Zoeth nodded and smiled in his quiet way If Mary had not
known their secret she would not have guessed it but as it was she
noticed how pale and worn Mr Hamilton looked and how the Captain had
become prone to fits of unwonted silence from which he seemed to arouse
himself with an effort and after a glance at her to talk and laugh
louder than ever Once she ventured to ask how business was and it would
have been almost funny if it had not been so pathetic the haste with
which they both assured her that it was about the same

After dinner she announced her intention of going up to the store Her
uncles exchanged looks and then Zoeth said

What makes you do that MaryGusta Nice day like this Id be out of
door if I was you We dont need you at the store do we Shadrach

Not moren a fish needs a bathin suit declared the Captain
with conviction You go see some of the girls and have a good time
MaryGusta

But Mary declined to go and see any of the girls She could have a
better time at the store than anywhere else she said She went to the
store and spent the afternoon and evening there watching and listening
There was not much to watch not more than a dozen customers during
the entire time and those bought but little The hardest part of the
experience for her was to see how eager her uncles were to please
each caller and how anxiously each watched the others efforts and the
result To see Zoeth at the desk poring over the ledger his lips moving
and the pencil trembling in his fingers was as bad as but no worse
than to see Captain Shadrach a frown on his face and his hands in his
pockets pace the floor from the back door to the front window stop
look up the road draw a long breath that was almost a groan then turn
and stride back again

At six oclock Mary who had reasons of her own for wishing to be left
alone in the store suggested that she remain there while her uncles
went home for supper Neither Mr Hamilton nor the Captain would
consent so she was obliged to go to the house herself and send Isaiah
up once more to act as shopkeeper But at eleven that night after
unmistakable sounds from their rooms were furnishing proofs that both
partners of Hamilton and Company were asleep she tiptoed downstairs
put on her coat and hat took the store keys from the nail where Zoeth
always hung them and went out She did not return until almost three

The next day she spent for the most part at the store She wrote
several letters and in spite of her uncles protests waited upon
several customers That evening as she sat behind the counter thinking
a boy whom Captain Shadrach identified as Zenas Atkins youngone rushed
breathlessly into the store to announce between gasps that MaryGusta
Lathrops wanted on the phone Its long distance too andandyouve
got to scrabble cause theyre holdin the wire Mary hurried out and
to the telephone office She had not answered Shadrachs question as
to who she thought was calling She did not know of course but she
suspected and for a coolheaded young business woman a girl who had
ruthlessly driven all thoughts except those of business from her mind
her heart beat surprisingly fast as she entered the closet which acted
as a substitute for a telephone booth and took down the receiver Yet
her tone was calm enough as she uttered the stereotyped Hello

The wire hummed and sang fragments of distant conversation became
audible and were lost and then a voice the voice which she was
expecting but in a way dreading to hear asked Hello Is this Miss
Lathrop

Yes Crawford

Mary is that you

Yes

I have just called at Mrs Wyeths and learned that you had gone I
am awfully disappointed I leave for home tomorrow and I had counted on
seeing you before I went Why did you go without a word to me

Didnt Mrs Wyeth tell you

She told me a good deal but I want to know more Is it truethat
about your uncles

I am afraid it is

Great Scott thats too bad I am mighty sorry to hear it Look here
isnt there something I can do Do they need

Sshh we mustnt talk about it over the phone No there is nothing you
can do I have some plans partially worked out something may come of
them Please dont ask more particulars now

All right I understand I wont But maynt I come down and see you
I can start West the day after tomorrow just as well and that would give
me time

No Crawford no You mustnt come

Ive a good mind to whether or no

If you do I shall not see youthen or at any other time But you
wont will you

No Mary I wont Its mighty hard though

Perhaps it was quite as hard for her but she did not reply

Will you write meevery day he went on    Why dont you
answer

I was thinking what would be best for me to do she said best for us
both I mean I shall write you one letter surely

ONE

One surely I want you to understand just what my coming here means and
what effect it may have upon my future You should know that Afterward
whether I write you or not will depend

Depend Of course youll write me Depend on what

On what seems right to me after I have had time to think and after you
have seen your father I must go Crawford Thank you for calling me I
am glad you did Goodby

Wait Mary dont go Let me say this

Please Crawford Id rather you wouldnt say any more You understand
why Im sure I hope you will have a pleasant trip home and find your
fathers health much improved Goodby

She hung up the receiver and hastened back to the store Shadrach and
Zoeth looked at her questioningly Finally the former said

Anything important was it

No Uncle Shad not very important

Oh

A short interval of silence then

Mrs Wyeth callin I presume likely eh

No Uncle Shad

Shadrach asked no more questions and Zoeth asked none Neither of
them again mentioned Marys call to the phone either to her or to each
other And she did not refer to it She had promised her Uncle Shadrach
when he questioned her the year before concerning Crawford to tell him
when there was anything to tell But was there anything to tell now
With the task which she had set herself and the uncertainty before her
she felt that there was not Yet to keep silence troubled her Until
recently there had never been a secret between her uncles and herself
now there were secrets on both sides




CHAPTER XIX


At twelve oclock on a night late in the following week Captain
Shadrach snoring gloriously in his bed was awakened by his partners
entering the room bearing a lighted lamp The Captain blinked raised
himself on his elbow looked at his watch which was on the chair by the
beds head and then demanded in an outraged whisper

What in the nation are you prowlin around this hour of the night
for You dont want to talk about those divilish bills and credits and
things I hope Whats the use Talkin dont help none Jumpin fire
I went to bed sos to forget em and I was just beginnin to do it Now
you

Zoeth held up his hand Sshh sshh he whispered Hush Shadrach
I didnt come to talk about those things Shadrach therestheres
somethin queer goin on Get up

The Captain was out of bed in a moment

Whats the matter he demanded in a whisper Whats queer

II dont exactly know I heard somebody movin downstairs and

Shadrach grunted Isaiah he exclaimed Walkin in his sleep again
Ill bet a dollar

No no It aint Isaiah Isaiah aint walked in his sleep since he was
a child

Well hes pretty nigh his second childhood now judgin by the way
he acts sometimes It was Isaiah of course Who else would be walkin
around downstairs this time of night

Thats what I thought so I went and looked Shadrach it was
MaryGusta Hush Let me tell you She had her things on hat and all
and she took the lantern and lit it and went out

Went OUT

Yes andand up the road Now where

Shadrachs answer was to stride to the window pull aside the shade and
look out Along the lane in the direction of the village a fiery spark
was bobbing

There she goes now he muttered Shes pretty nigh to the corner
already What in the world can she be up to Where is she boundat
twelve oclock

Zoeth did not answer His partner turned and looked at him

Humph he exclaimed Why dont you tell me the whole of it while
youre about it Youre keepin somethin back Out with it Do YOU know
where shes bound

Zoeth looked troubledand guilty Why no Shadrach he faltered I
dont know butbut I kind of suspect You see sheshe did the same
thing last night

She DID And you never said a word

I didnt know what to say I heard her go and I looked out of the
window and saw her She come back about three I thought sure shed
speak of it this mornin but she didnt andandBut tonight I watched
again andShadrach shes taken the store keys Anyhow theyre gone
from the nail

The Captain wiped his forehead Shes gone to the store then he
muttered Jumpin Thats a relief anyhow I was afraidI didnt
knowWhew I dont know WHAT I didnt know But what on earth has she
gone to the store for And last night too you say

Yes Shadrach Ive been thinkin and all I can think of is
thatthat

Wellwhat

Thatthat she suspicions how things are with ussomebody that does
suspicion has dropped a hint and she hashas gone up to

To do what Chuck it overboard Speak it out To do what

To look at the books or somethin She knows the combination of the
safe you recollect

Captain Shadrachs eyes and mouth opened simultaneously He made a dive
for the hooks on the bedroom wall

Jumpin fire of brimstone he roared Give me my clothes

A halfhour later an interested personand so far as that goes at
least every second person in South Harniss would have been interested
had he or she been aware of what was going onan interested and of
course unscrupulous person peeping in under the shades of Hamilton and
Companys window would have seen a curious sight This person would have
seen two elderly men sitting one upon a wooden chair and the other
upon a wooden packing case and wearing guilty not to say hangdog
expressions while a young woman standing in front of them delivered
pointed and personal remarks

Captain Shadrach and Zoeth following their niece to the store had
peeped in and seen her sitting at the desk the safe open and account
books and papers spread out before her A board in the platform creaked
beneath the Captains weighty tread and Mary looked up and saw them
Before they could retreat or make up their minds what to do she had
run to the door thrown it open and ordered them to come in Neither
answeredthey could not at the moment The certainty that she knew what
they had tried so hard to conceal kept them tonguetied

Come in repeated Mary Come in And shut the door

They came in Also Captain Shadrach shut the door Just why he obeyed
orders so meekly he could not have told His niece gave him little time
to think

I did not exactly expect you she said but on the whole I am glad
you came Now sit down both of you and listen to me What do you mean
by it

Zoeth sat without a word Shadrach however made a feeble attempt to
bluster

What do WE mean by it he repeated What do YOU mean you mean
Perusin up here in the middle of the night without a word to your Uncle
Zoeth and me andand haulin open that safeand

Again Mary interrupted

Be still Uncle Shad she commanded Sit down Sit down on that box
and listen to me Thats right Now tell me Why have you been telling
me fibs for almost a year Answer me Why have you

Zoeth looked at Shadrach and the latter looked at him

Fibs stammered Mr Hamilton Fibs Whywhy MaryGusta

Yes fibs I might use a stronger word and not exaggerate very much
You have led me to think that business was good that you were doing as
well or better than when I was here with you I asked you over and over
again and you invariably gave me that answer And now I know that during
all that time you have scarcely been able to make ends meet that you
have been worrying yourselves sick that you

Captain Shad could stand it no longer

We aint neither he declared I never was better in my life I
aint had a doctor for moren a year And then I only had him for the
heavesfor the horsea horse doctor I mean What are you talkin
about Sick nothin If that swab of an Isaiah has

Stop Uncle Shad I told you to listen And you neednt try to change
the subject or to pretend I dont know what I am talking about I do
know And as for pretendingwell there has been pretending enough
What do you meanyou and Uncle Zoethby sending me off to school and
to Europe and declaring up and down that you didnt need me here at
home

We didnt need you MaryGusta vowed Zoeth eagerly We got along
fustrate without you And we wanted you to go to school and to Europe
You see it makes us feel proud to know our girl is gettin a fine
education and seein the world It aint any more than she deserves but
it makes us feel awful pleased to know shes gettin it

And as for the store broke in the Captain I callate youve been
pawin over them books and theyve kind ofkind of gone to your head
I dont wonder at it this time of night Hamilton and Companys
all right We may be a little mite behind in some of our bills
buterbut    DONT look at me like that MaryGusta What do you
do it for Stop it wont you

Mary shook her head

No Uncle Shad she said I shant stop it I know all about Hamilton
and Companys condition perhaps I know it better than you do This is
the fifth night that I have been working over those books and I should
know at least

The FIFTH night Do you mean to say

I mean that I knew you wouldnt tell me what I wanted to know I had to
see these books for myself and at night was the only time I could do it
But never mind that now she added Well talk of that later Other
things come first Uncle Shad and Uncle Zoeth I know not only about the
affairs of Hamilton and Company but about my own as well

Zoeth leaned forward and stared at her He seemed to catch the
significance of the remark for he looked frightened whereas Shadrach
was only puzzled

Youyou know what MaryGusta faltered Zoeth You mean

I mean went on Mary that I know where the money came from which has
paid my school bills and for my clothes and my traveling things and
all the rest I know whose money has paid all my bills ever since I was
seven years old

Shadrach rose from his chair He was as frightened as his partner now

What are you talkin about MaryGusta Lathrop he shouted You
know You dont know nothin You stop sayin such things Why dont you
stop her Zoeth Hamilton

Zoeth was speechless Mary went on as if there had been no interruption

I know she said that I havent a penny of my own and never did have
and that you two have done it all I know all about itat last

If these two men had been caught stealing they could not have looked
more guilty If instead of being reminded that their niece had spent
their money they had been accused of misappropriating hers they could
not have been more shaken or dumbfounded Captain Shadrach stood before
her his face a fiery red and his mouth opening and shutting in vain
attempts at articulation Zoeth his thin fingers extended in appeal
was the first to speak

MaryGusta he stammered dont talk so PLEASE dont

Mary smiled Oh yes I shall Uncle Zoeth she said I mean to do
more than talk from now on but I must talk a little first Im not
going to try to tell you what it means to me to learn after all these
years that I have been dependent on you for everything I have had
home and luxuries and education and opportunities I realize now what
sacrifices you must have made

We aint neither roared the Captain in frantic protest We aint
I tell you Somebodys been tellin lies aint they Zoeth Why

Hush Uncle Shad Someone HAS been telling meerfibsI said that
at the beginning but theyre not going to tell me any more I know
the truth every bit of it about Fathers losing his money in stocks
andUncle Shad where are you going

Captain Shad was halfway to the door He answered over his shoulder

Im goin home he vowed and when I get there Im goin to choke
that dummed tattletale of an Isaiah Chase Ill talk to YOU after Ive
done it

Mary ran after him and caught his arm

Come back Uncle Shad she ordered Come back sit down and dont be
foolish I dont want you to talk to me I am going to talk to you and
Im not half through yet Besides it wasnt Isaiah who told me it was
Judge Baxter

Judge Baxter Why the everlastin old

Hush He couldnt help telling me I made him do it Be still both of
you and Ill tell you all about it

She did tell them beginning with her meeting with Mr Green at the Howe
dinner then of her stop at Ostable and the interview with Baxter

So I have found it all out you see she said Im not going to try
to thank youI couldnt if I did try But I am going to take my turn
at the work and the worry To begin with of course you understand that
I am through with Boston and school through forever

There was an excited and voluble protest of course but she paid no
heed whatever to commands or entreaties

I am through she declared I shall stay here and help you I am
only a girl and I cant do much perhaps but I truly believe I can do
something I am a sort of silent partner now you understand that dont
you

Shadrach looked doubtful and anxious

If I had my way he declared youd go straight back to that school
and stay there longs we could rake or scrape enough together to keep
you there And I know Zoeth feels the same

I sartin do agreed Zoeth

Mary laughed softly But you havent your way you see she said You
have had it for ever so long and now I am going to have mine Your new
silent partner is going to begin to boss you

For the first time since he entered the door of his store that nightor
morningShadrach smiled It wasnt a broad smile nor a very gay one
but it was a smile

Umyaas he drawled I want to know MaryGusta I am gettin some
along in years but my memory aint failed much If I could remember any
day or hour or minute since Zoeth and me histed you into the old buggy
to drive you from Ostable hereif I could remember a minute of that
time when you HADNT bossed us Iwell Id put it down in the log with
a red ink circle around it No siree Youve been OUR skipper from the
start

Even Zoeth smiled now and Mary laughed aloud

But you havent objected you havent minded beingwhat shall I call
itskippedby me have you she asked

The Captain grinned Mind it he exclaimed Umph The only time when
we really minded it was these last two years when we aint had it We
minded missin it thats what we minded

Well you wont miss it any more Now help me put these things back in
the safe and well go home Yes home Tomorrow morningthis morning
I meanwell talk and Ill tell you some of my plans Oh yes I
have plans and I am in hopes they may do great things for Hamilton and
Company But no more talk tonight Remember the skipper is back on
board

So to the house they went and to bed the Captain and Mr Hamilton under
protest




CHAPTER XX


Neither Mary nor the Captain nor Mr Hamilton slept much of the few
hours until daylight and Captain Shadrach who was devoured with
curiosity concerning the plans would have asked particulars before
breakfast but Mary would not listen to questions It was not until
breakfast was over and they were back in the store that she consented to
discuss the subject

The safe was reopened and the books and papers spread out upon the desk
Mary took up one of the sheets of paper it was covered with rows of
figures in her handwriting

Now she said it seems to me that the first thing is to find out
exactly where we stand When I say we she added with a nod of great
importance I mean we because as I told you last night I am a
silent partner in the business now

Dont seem to be so terrible much silence observed Shadrach dryly

Hush Another remark of that kind and I shall set you to sweeping out
Uncle Shad Now Uncle Zoeth according to the books this is what we
owe

She read from the paper in her hand

That is the total Uncle Zoeth isnt it she asked Zoeth groaned and
admitted that he callated it was nigh enough

Yes But this holding up another sheet of paper is what is owed us
and it is almost as much as the other

It was Shadrachs turn to groan Tis if we could get ahold of it
he muttered The heft of the gang on that list aint got a cent and the
bulk of the rest of em wouldnt have if they paid what they owed

Mary nodded determinedly

There are some that can pay she said Jeremiah Clifford for
instance According to the books he owes us over a hundred and ten
dollars and part of the account is three years old Mr Clifford owns
property He cant be a poor man

The Captain sniffed His wife owns the property he said Every
sticks in her name Jerry Cliffords got enough but he loves it too
well to let go of it Mean Why say In the old days when fishin
schooners used to run from South Harniss here Jerry he was owner and
skipper of a little hooker and Solon Black went one vyage with him
There was another fomast hand besides Jerry and Solon aboard and Solon
swears that all the hearty provision Jerry put on board for a fourday
trip was two sticks of smoked herrin For two days so Solon vows they
ate the herrin and the other two they chewed the sticks That may be
stretchin it a mite but anyhow it goes to show that Jerry Clifford
dont shed money same as a cat does its hair

Zoeth put in a word

He says hell pay pretty soon he observed plaintively Hes been
sayin it for over a year though

Humph grunted Shadrach Theres only a difference of one letter
between sayin and payin but there aint but two between trust
and bust

Mary spoke Never mind she said I shall see Mr Clifford
myself And I shall see some of these others too Now about our own
billsthose we owe I have a list of the principal creditors Mr
Greens firm is one of them we owe them most of all it seems I think
I shall go and see Mr Green myself

For the land sakes what for demanded Shadrach He knows how were
fixed Zoeth wrote him

Yes but I want to talk with him nevertheless

But what for You aint goin beggin him to

Im not going begging at all When I talked with him at the Howes he
not knowing in the least who I was or that I was your niece expressed
sympathy for Hamilton and Company and wished there were some way of
helping us out of our troublesomething he could do you know Im not
sure there isnt something he can do At any rate I am going to see
him I shall start for Boston Monday morning

Zoeth ventured an observation

Hell be considerable surprised to see you wont he he said

Mary laughed I think he will she replied Surprised and a little
embarrassed But I imagine his embarrassment will make him all the
more anxious to be of service to me and thats what I want from
himservice

Of course the partners asked hundreds more questions concerning the
plans Marys answers were still disappointingly vague Before she could
tell just what she meant to do she said she must be sure and she was
not sure yet A great deal would depend upon her Boston trip They must
be patient until she returned from that

So they were patientthat is to say Zoeth was really so and Captain
Shadrach was as patient as it was his nature to be Mary was absent
nearly a week When she returned she had much to tell She had
visited Mr Green at his office on Commercial Street His surprise
and embarrassment were all that she had prophesied He offered profuse
apologies for his blunder at the Howes

Of course if I had known of your relationship to Captain Gould and
Mr Hamilton he began I should neverReally I amI assure you I
hadnt the slightest idea

He was floundering like a stranded fish Mary helped him off the shoals
by taking the remainder of his apologies for granted

Of course you hadnt she said But I am very glad you told me Mr
Green It was high time I knew Dont say another word about it please
I have come to you to ask advice and perhaps help of a sort May I
have a little of your time

Mr Green seized the opportunity thus offered Indeed she might have
time all the time she wanted Anything in his power to doand so on
Being a bachelor and something of an elderly beau who prided himself
upon making a good impression with the sex it had annoyed him greatly
the memory of his mistake Also he had been distinctly taken with Mary
and was anxious to reinstate himself in her opinion So his willingness
to atone was even eager

As it happens he said I am not at all busy this afternoon I can
give you the rest of the day if you wish Now what can I do for you

Mary explained that she had come to speak with him concerning her
uncles business affairs his house being Hamilton and Companys largest
creditor She told of her investigations of the condition in which
she had found the accounts and of her determination to remain at South
Harniss and work for the upbuilding of the concern

Of course I am not a business person like yourself Mr Green she
said I am only a girl But I worked in my uncles store and in a
way managed it for two years or more before I came to Boston to school
Beside that I have talked during these last few days with some of South
Harnisss most prominent peoplepermanent residents not summer people
From what they and others tell me I am convinced that the sole reason
why my uncles business has fallen behind is because of a lack of
keeping up to the times in the face of competition Everyone likes Uncle
Zoeth and Uncle Shadrach and wishes them wellthey couldnt help that
you know

She made this assertion with such evident pride and with such absolute
confidence that Mr Green although inclined to smile felt it might
be poor judgment to do so So he agreed that there was no doubt of
Shadrachs and Zoeths universal popularity

Yes went on Mary they are dears both of them and they think
everyone else is as honest as they are which is a mistake of course
So some people impose on them and dont pay their bills I intend to
stop that

She evidently expected her listener to make some comment so he said
Oh indeed

Yes continued Mary I intend to stop their trusting everyone under
the sun and I shall try my hardest to collect from those they have
already trusted There is almost enough due to pay every bill we owe
and I believe twothirds of that is collectible if one really goes after
it

And you will go after it I presume

I most certainly shall You are smiling Mr Green I suppose it sounds
like a joke a girl like myself making such statements about things men
are supposed to understand and women not to understand at all It isnt
a joke in this case because I think I understand my uncles business
better than they do I think I can collect what is owed us pay what we
owe and make money there in South Harniss But to do that I must have
time and by and by credit for we need goods And that is what I came
to talk to you about

She had brought with her copies of the Hamilton and Company trial
balance also a list of the firms debtors and creditors These she
put upon the desk before Mr Green and ran a finger down the pages
with explanatory remarks such as This is good I know This can be
collected but it may take a lawyer to get it or as in the case of
Rastus Youngs longstanding indebtedness This isnt worth anything
and shouldnt be counted

You see she said in conclusion we arent in such a VERY bad state
it isnt hopeless anyway Now here are the accounts we owe Yours is
the largest Here are the others All these bills are going to be paid
just as I said but they cant be paid at all unless I have time I have
been thinking thinking very hard Mr Green

Green nodded I can see that he put in goodnaturedly

Yes Well this is what I want to ask you Will you give us six months
more to pay the whole of this bill in I dont think we shall need so
much time but I want to be sure And if at the end of two months we
have paid half of it will you give us credit for another small bill of
goods for the summer season so that we may be stocked and ready The
summer is our best season you see she added

Mr Green nodded Her businesslike manner he found amusing although he
by no means shared her confidence in the future

We shall be very glad to extend the time he said You may remember
I told you the other evening that so far as our house was concerned
we should probably be willing to sell your uncles indefinitely for old
times sake

His visitor frowned

We are not asking it for old times sake she said It is the new
times I am interested in And please understand this isnt sentiment but
business If you do not believe what I ask to be a safe business risk
that one your firm would be justified in accepting from anybody then
you mustnt do it

Mr Green hesitated Suppose I do not accept that risk he said what
then

Then I shall go and see some other creditors the principal ones and
make them similar propositions

And suppose they dont accept

I think they will most of them If they dontwell then there
is another way My uncles own their house and store They have been
thinking of selling their property to pay their debts I should hate to
have them sell and I dont believe it is necessary I have been
talking with Judge Baxter over at OstableI stopped there on my way to
Bostonand he suggested that they might mortgage and raise money that
way It could be done couldnt it Mortgages are a kind of business I
dont know anything about They sound horrid

Sometimes they are Miss Lathrop if I were you I shouldnt sell or
mortgage yet I am inclined to believe judging by this balance sheet
and what you say that you have a chance to pull Hamilton and Company
out of the fire and Im very sure you can do it if anyone can Are you
going to be in the city for a day or two Good Then will you let me
consider this whole matter untilsayThursday By that time I shall
have made up my mind and may have something to say which will be worth
while Can you come in Thursday afternoon at two And will you Very
well Oh dont thank me I havent done anything yet Perhaps I shall
not be able to but we shall hope for the best

Mary went straight to Mrs Wyeths home on Pinckney Street and once
more occupied her pleasant room on the third floor In spite of her
determination not to care she could not help feeling a little pang as
she walked by the Misses Cabots school and remembered that she would
never again enjoy the privileges and advantages of that exclusive
institution She wondered how the girls her classmates had felt and
spoken when they heard the news that she had left them and returned
to Cape Cod and storekeeping Some would sneer and laughshe knew
thatand some might be a little sorry But they would all forget her
of course Doubtless most of them had forgotten her already

But the fact that all had not forgotten was proved that very evening
when as she and Mrs Wyeth and Miss Pease were sitting talking together
in the parlor Maggie the maid answering the ring of the doorbell
ushered in Miss Barbara Howe Barbara was as usual arrayed like the
lilies of the field but her fine petals were decidedly crumpled by the
hug which she gave Mary as soon as she laid eyes upon her

You bad girl she cried Why didnt you tell me you were in town And
why didnt you answer my letterthe one I wrote you at South Harniss I
didnt hear a word and only tonight after dinner I had the inspiration
of phoning Mrs Wyeth and trying to learn from her where you were and
what you meant by dropping all your friends Maggie answered the phone
and said you were here and I threw on my thingsyes threw is the
word nothing else describes the processand came straight over How DO
you do And WHAT are you doing

Mary said she was well and that she had been too busy to reply to Miss
Howes letter But this did not satisfy Barbara wanted to know why she
had been busy and how so Mary told of her determination to remain in
South Harniss and become a business woman Barbara was greatly excited
and enthusiastic

Wont it be perfectly splendid she exclaimed I only wish I were
going to do it instead of having to stay at that straightupanddown
school and listen to Prissys dissertations on Emerson She told the
Freshman class the other day that she had had the honor of meeting Mr
Emerson when very youngwhen SHE was young she meant she always tells
every Freshman class that you knowand one of the Freshies spoke up
and asked if she ever met him afterwards when he was older They said
her face was a picture I wish I might have seen it But do tell me more
about that wonderful store of yours I am sure it will be a darling
because anything you have anything to do with is sure to be Are you
going to have a tearoom

Mary shook her head No she said laughing I think not Theres too
much competition

Oh but you ought to have one Not of the ordinary kind you know
but thethe other kind the unusual kind Why I have a cousina
secondno third cousin a relative of Daddys she iswho hadnt much
money and whose health wasnt good and the doctor sent her to live in
the country Live there all the time Only fancy Oh I forgot you were
going to do the same thing Do forgive me Im so sorry WHAT a perfect
gump I am Oh dear me There I go again And I know you abhor slang
Mrs Wyeth

Tell me more about your cousin Barbara put in Mary before the
shocked Mrs Wyeth could reply

Oh she went to the country and took an old house the funniest old
thing you ever saw And she put up the quaintest little sign And opened
a tearoom and gift shop I dont know why they call them gift shops
They certainly dont give away anything Far far from that my dear
Daddy calls this one of Esthers The Robbers Roost because he says
she charges forty cents for a gill of tea and two slices of toast cut
in eight pieces But I tell him he doesnt pay for the tea and toast
aloneit is the atmosphere of the place He says if he had to pay for
all his atmosphere at that rate he would be asphyxiated in a few months
But he admires Esther very much She makes heaps and heaps of money

Then her tearoom and gift shop is a success

A success Oh my dear Its a scream of a success Almost any day in
summer there are at least a dozen motor cars outside the door Everybody
goes there its the proper thing to do I know all this because it
isnt very far from our summer home in Claytonin the mountains you
know

So she made a success mused Mary Were there other tearooms about

Oh dozens But theyre not original hers is They havent thethe
somethingyou know what I mean Esther has the style the knack theI
cant say it but you know And you would have it too Im perfectly
sure you would

Mary was evidently much interested

I wish I might meet your cousin she said

Why you can She is here in Boston now buying for the summer Ill
phone her and we three will lunch together tomorrow Dont say you
wont youve just got to

So Mary rather reluctantly consented to make one of the luncheon
party Afterward she was glad that she did for Miss Esther
Hemingwaythis was the cousins namewas an interesting person She
told Mary all about her tearoom and gift shop how she started in
business the mistakes she made at first and the lessons she had
learned from experience Because Barbara had asked her to do so she
brought with her photographs of the establishment its attractive and
quaint exterior and its equally delightful interior

The whole secret she said is in keeping everything in good taste
and simple Choose the right location fit up your rooms in taste and
cheerfully serve the best you can find and sell the unusual and the
attractive things that other people do not have or at least are not
likely to have Then charge adequate prices

Adequate being spelled A double D observed Barbara significantly

Mary parted from Miss Hemingway with a new idea in her head an idea
that sometime or other she meant to put into practice

On Thursday afternoon she called upon Mr Green That gentleman having
had his opportunity to think was ready with a proposition Briefly it
was this He had personally seen the principal creditors of Hamilton
and Companythey were all Boston business housesand he and they had
agreed to make the following offer Hamilton and Companys credit upon
debts already owed was to be extended six months Mary was to go home
endeavor to collect what money she could and with it buy for cash
whatever goods were needed for the summer season If that season was a
success and the business promised well for the future then arrangements
could be made for future buying and for paying the old debt a little at
a time

At any rate concluded Mr Green this postpones the mortgaging or
selling for a time at least and you always have it to fall back on if
you cant make your new undertaking pay I believe you can I advise you
to accept Your other creditors feel the same way

He did not add as he might have done that the opinion of those other
creditors had been influenced almost entirely by his own and that in
one or two instances he had been obliged practically to underwrite the
payment of Hamilton and Companys indebtedness before gaining consent
He had talked with Mr Howe who in turn had called his daughter into
consultation and Barbaras enthusiastic praise of her friend had
strengthened the favorable impression which the girl had already made
upon both gentlemen Do you know I believe she may win out observed
Mr Howe

I am inclined to think she will concurred Green

Of course she will declared Barbara hotly No one who ever knew her
would be silly enough to think she wouldnt

Hence Mr Greens underwriting expedition and the proposition to Mary as
the representative of Hamilton and Company

Mary accepted of course She was very grateful and said so

I dont know how to thank you Mr Green I cant promise anything but
if trying hard will win I can promise that she said

Thats all right thats all right I know youll try and I think
youll succeed Now why dont you go up and pick out some of those
summer goods You dont need them yet and you neednt pay for them yet
but now is the time to select Give my regards to your uncles when you
see them and tell them I wish them luck I may be motoring down the Cape
this summer and if I do I shall drop in on you and them

Mary had news to tell when she reached South Harniss It was listened
to with attention if not entirely in silence Captain Shadrachs
ejaculations of You dont say I want to know and Jumpin fire
how you talk served as punctuation marks during the narration When
she had finished her story she said

And now Uncle Zoeth and Uncle Shadnow that youve heard the whole of
it and know what my plan is what do you think of it

Both answers were characteristic Zoeth drew a long breath

The Almighty sent you to us MaryGusta he vowed There was a time
a little spell ago when I begun to think Hed pretty nigh deserted us I
was almost discouraged and it shook my trustit shook my trust But now
I can see He was just tryin us out and in His good time He sent you to
haul us off the shoals Hell do it too I know it and Ill thank Him
tonight on my knees

Shadrach shook his head By fire he cried MaryGusta I always
said you was a wonder Youve given us a chance to get clear of the
breakers anyhow and thats somethin wed never have done ourselves
Now if you can collect that money from Jeremiah Clifford IllIllI
swan to man Ill believe anythings possible even Jonahs swallowin
the whale

Oh Shadrach protested his partner If you wouldnt be so
irreverent

All right Ill behave But its just as I say if MaryGusta can get
Jerry Clifford to pay up Ill swallow Jonah and the whale too Twas
Moses that hit the rock and the water gushed out want it Umhm
Well that was somethin of a miracle but strikin Jerry Clifford for
ten cents and gettin it would be a bigger one Why that fellers got
fists likelike one of those sensitive plants my mother used to have
in the settinroom window when I was a boy You touch a leaf of one
of those plants and twould shrivel up tight Jerrys fists are that
waytouch one of em with a nickel and twill shut up but not until
the nickels inside No sir Ho ho

If you knew all this Uncle Shad suggested Mary why in the world
did you sell Mr Clifford at all If he wouldnt pay why sell him

Mr Hamilton answered

He always did pay he said You see he had to have groceries and
clothes and such and whenever he needed more and thought he owed us so
much we wouldnt put more on the bill hed pay a little on account That
way we managed to keep up with him

Not exactly up with him commented the Captain We was always a
couple of laps astern but we could keep him in sight Now the new
stores have come and he can get trusted there he dont buy from usor
pay either Whats the use Thats what he thinks I callate

Mary considered The mean old sinner she said I should judge Uncle
Shad that what you told me once when I was a little girl about the
Free Masons might apply to Mr Cliffords pocketbook You said that once
in Masonry a man never got out A dollar in Mr Cliffords pocketbook
never gets out either does it

Shadrach chuckled You bet it dont he agreed Its got a life
sentence And so fur as that goes they generally open a Mason lodge
meetin with prayer but twould take moren that to open Jerrys
pocketbook ILL bet you

And nevertheless declared Mary laughing I mean to make him pay
our bill

She did make the tightfisted one pay up eventually but months were to
elapse before that desirable consummation was reached In the meantime
she set herself to collecting other amounts owed Hamilton and Company
and to building up the trade at the store The collecting was not so
difficult as she had expected The Captain and Mr Hamilton had been
reluctant to ask their friends and neighbors to be prompt in their
payments and largely through carelessness accounts had been permitted
to drop behind Mary personally saw the debtors and in most cases by
offering slight discounts or by accepting installments she was able
to obtain at least the greater part of the money due In some cases she
could obtain nothing and expected nothing but these cases among them
that of Rastus Young were rather to be considered in the light of good
riddance even at the price As Shadrach said it was worth a few dollars
not to have to listen to Rastus or Mrs Rastus cry over their troubles
whenever they wanted to hold up the firm for more plunder

Last time Rastus was in to buy anything declared the Captain he
shed so blamed many tears into my rubber boots that I got wet feet and
sent the boots to the cobblers to have em plugged I callated they
leaked I didnt realize twas Rat workin me out of four dollars worth
of groceries by water power

The collections then those from Mr Young and his ilk excepted were
satisfactory Mary was enabled to buy and pay for a modest assortment of
summer supplies those she had selected while in Boston The store she
had thoroughly cleaned and renovated The windows were kept filled with
attractive displays of goods and the prices of these goods as set
forth upon tickets were attractive also Business began to pick up not
a great deal at first but a little and as May brought the first of
the earlybird summer cottagers to South Harniss the silent partner
of Hamilton and Company awaited the coming of what should be the firms
busiest season with hope and some confidence




CHAPTER XXI


During all this time she had heard from Crawford at least once a week
He would have written oftener than that had she permitted it And in
spite of her determination so bravely expressed in their interview over
the telephone she had written him more than the one letter she had
promised In that letterher firstshe told him the exact situation
there at home of her discovery that her uncles were in trouble that
the small but to them precious business they had conducted so long
was in danger and of her determination to give up school and remain at
South Harniss where she knew she was needed Then she went on to tell
of her still greater discovery that instead of being a young woman of
independent means she was and always had been dependent upon the bounty
of her uncles


You can imagine how I felt when I learned this she wrote when I
thought of all the kindness I had accepted at their hands accepted it
almost as if it was my right thinking as I did that my own money paid
And now to learn that all the time I had nothing and they had given
of their own when they had so little and given it so cheerfully so
gladly And Crawford when I told them what I had done they would not
accept thanks they would not let me even speak of the great debt I owed
them So far from that they acted as if they were the ones who owed and
as if I had caught them in some disgraceful act Why if they could
they would have sent me back to Boston and to school while they
remained here to work and worry until the bankruptcy they expected came

Do you wonder that I feel my first and whole duty is to them and that
nothing NOTHING must be permitted to interfere with it I am going to
stay here and try to help Perhaps I shall succeed and perhaps which
is just as probable I may fail but at any rate while my uncles live
and need me I shall not leave them They gave all they had to me when
there was no real reason why they should give anything The very least
I can do is to be with them and work for them now when they are growing
old

I am sure you must understand this and that therefore you will
forget


She paused Forget was a hard word to write Fortunately she had
written it at the top of a page so she tore up that sheet and began the
line again


I am sure you will understand and that you will see my duty as I see it
myself It seems to me clear Everyone has duties I suppose but you
and I have ours very plainly shown us I think Yours is to your father
and mine to my uncles


Bringing that letter to an end was a difficult task There were things
which must be said and they were so very hard to say At last after
many attempts


I have not referred she wrote to what you said to me when we last met
It seems almost useless to refer to it doesnt it You see how I
am placed here and I have written you what I mean to do And please
understand I am doing it gladly I am happy in having the opportunity to
do it but it does mean that for years my life and interest must be here
with them Even if I were sure of my own feelingsand perhaps I am not
really sureI certainly should not think of asking one I cared for to
wait so long You have your future to think of Crawford and you must
think of it And there is your father Of course I dont know but I
somehow feel certain that he will not wish you to marry me Dont you
think it better for us both to end it now It seems so hopeless


Which she flattered herself was brave and sensible and right And
having reached this commendable conclusion and sealed and posted the
letter she came back to the house went upstairs to her room and
throwing herself upon the bed cried bitterly for many minutes

Yet in a way her tears were wasted It takes two to make a bargain and
although she might notify Crawford Smith that his case was hopeless
it by no means followed that that young gentleman would accept
the notification as final His reply to her letter was prompt and
convincing All the references to ending it were calmly brushed aside
There could be but two endings one being their marriagethis of
course the logical and proper endingand the other Marys notifying
him that she did not love him Anything else was nonsense and not worth
consideration Wait He would wait fifty years if necessary provided
she would wait for him He was about to take up his studies again but
now he would feel that he was working for her His father he was sorry
to say was not at all well He was very nervous weak and irritable


I came home he wrote fully determined to tell him of you and my
determination to marry youalways provided you will have me you
knowon the very night of my arrival But when I saw how poor old Dad
was feeling and after the doctor told me how very necessary it was that
his nervous system be allowed a complete rest I decided I must wait So
I shall wait perhaps I shall not tell him for months but just as soon
as he is able to hear I shall speak and I am sure he will say
Good luck and God bless you But if he doesnt it will make not the
slightest difference If you will have me Mary dear nothing on this
earth is going to stop my having you Thats as settled and solid a fact
as the Rocky Mountains


He pleaded for a letter at least once a week


You neednt put a word of love in it he wrote I know how
conscientious you are and I know perfectly well that until your mind
is made up you wont feel it right to encourage me in the least But do
please write if only to tell me how you are getting on with Hamilton
and Company I only wish I were there to help you pull those fine old
uncles of yours out of the hot water I know youll do it though And
meanwhile I shall be digging away out here and thinking of you Please
write OFTEN


So Mary after considerable thought and indecision did write although
Crawfords suggestion that her letters have no word of love in them
was scrupulously followed And so while the summer came and went the
letters crossed and the news of the slow but certain building up of the
business of Hamilton and Company was exchanged for that of Edwin Smiths
steady regaining of health and strength

And Hamilton and Companys business was reviving Even the skeptics
could see the signs The revival began before the summer residents
arrived in South Harniss but after the latter began to come and the
cottages to open it was on in earnest John Keith helped to give it its
first big start Mrs Wyeth wrote him of Marys leaving her school work
to go to the rescue of Shadrach and Zoeth and the girls pluck and
uncomplaining acceptance of the task she considered set for her made
Keiths eyes twinkle with admiration as he read the letter The family
came early to South Harniss and this year he came with them One of his
first acts after arrival was to stroll down to the village and enter
Hamilton and Companys store Mary and the partners were there of
course He shook hands with them cordially

Well Captain he said addressing Shadrach how is the new hand
taking hold

Shadrach grinned Hand he repeated I dont knows weve got any new
hand Mr Keith Aint have we Zoeth

Zoeth did not recognize the joke He means MaryGusta I callate
Shadrach he said Shes doin splendid Mr Keith I dont know how
we ever got along without her

I do put in his partner promptly we didnt thats how But Mr
Keith you hadnt ought to call MaryGusta a hand Zoeth and me are
the hands aboard this craft Shes skipper and engineer and purser
andyes and pilot too And dont she make us tumble up lively when
she whistles Whew Dont talk

She is the boss then is she observed Keith

Boss I guess SO Shes got US trained Why Ive got so that I jump
out of bed nights and run round the room in my sleep thinkin shes
just hollered to me theres a customer waitin Oh shes a hard driver
MaryGusta is Never had a fust mate aboard drove hardern she does
And its havin its effect on us too Look at Zoeth Hes agin fast
hes a year oldern he was twelve months ago

Keith laughed Mary smiled and Mr Hamilton judging by the behavior of
the company that there was a joke somewhere on the premises smiled too

You mustnt mind Uncle Shad Mr Keith said Mary He talks a great
deal

Talkins all the exercise my face gets nowadays declared the Captain
instantly She keeps me so busy I dont get time to eat What do you
think of the store Mr Keith Some improvement aint it

Keith who had already noticed the trim appearance of the store and the
neat and attractive way in which the goods were displayed expressed his
hearty approval

And how is business he asked

Tiptop declared Shadrach

Its improvin considerble said Zoeth

It is a little better but it must be far better before I am
satisfied said Mary

How is the cottage trade asked Keith

Why not so very good There arent many cottagers here yet

When Keith reached home he called his wife into consultation

Gertrude he asked where do we buy our household supplies groceries
and the like

In Boston most of them The othersthose I am obliged to buy here in
South Harnissat that new store Bakers

I want you to buy them all of Hamilton and Company hereafter

THAT oldfogy place Why

Because the partners Captain Gould and the other old chap are having
a hard struggle to keep going and I want to help them

Mrs Keith tossed her head Humph she sniffed I know why you are
so interested It is because of that upstart girl you think is so
wonderful the one who has been boarding with Clara Wyeth

Youre right thats just it She has given up her studies and her
opportunities there in Boston and has come down here to help her uncles
Clara writes me that she was popular there in the school that the
best people were her friends and you know of her summer in Europe with
Letitia Pease Letitia isnt easy to please and she is enthusiastic
about Mary Lathrop No ordinary girl could give up all that sort of
thing and come back to the village where everyone knows her and go to
keeping store again and do it so cheerfully and sensibly and without
a word of complaint She deserves all the help and support we and our
friends can give her I mean to see that she has it

Mrs Keith looked disgusted Youre perfectly infatuated with that
girl John Keith she said It is ridiculous If I were like some
women I should be jealous

If I were like some men you might be Now Gertrude youll buy in
future from Hamilton and Company wont you

I suppose so When your chin sets that way I know youre going to be
stubborn and I may as well give in first as last Ill patronize your
precious MaryGusta but I WONT associate with her You neednt ask
that

Dont you think we might wait until she asks it first

Tut tut Really John you disgust me I wonder you dont order Sam to
marry her

From what Clara writes he might not have needed any orders if he had
received the least encouragement from her Sam might do worse I imagine
he probably will

So because John Keiths chin was set the Keith custom shifted
to Hamilton and Company And because the Keiths were wealthy and
influential and because the head of the family saw that that influence
was brought to bear upon his neighbors and acquaintances their custom
followed Hamilton and Company put a delivery wagona secondhand
oneout on the road and hired a distinctly secondhand boy to drive it
And Mary and Shadrach and Zoeth and in the evenings the boy as well
were kept busy waiting on customers The books showed since the silent
partner took hold a real and tangible profit and the collection and
payment of old debts went steadily on

The partners Shadrach and Zoeth were no longer silent and glum The
Captain whistled and sang and was in high spirits most of the time At
home he was his old self chaffing Isaiah about the housekeeping taking
a mischievous delight in shocking his friend and partner by irreverent
remarks concerning Jonah or some other Old Testament personage and
occasionally although not often throwing out a sly hint to Mary about
the frequency of letters from the West Mary had told her uncles
of Crawfords leaving Boston and returning to Nevada because of his
fathers ill health The only item of importance she had omitted to tell
was that of the proposal of marriage She could not speak of that even
to them They would ask what her answer was to be and if she loved
Crawford How could she answer thattruthfullywithout causing them to
feel that they were blocking her way to happiness They felt that quite
keenly enough as it was

So when Captain Shad declared the illness of the South Harniss
postmasterconfined to his bed with sciaticato be due to his having
stooped to pick up one of them eightytwo page Wild West letters of
yours MaryGusta and twas so heavy he sprained his back liftin
it Mary only laughed and ventured the opinion that the postmasters
sprained back if he had one was more likely due to a twist received
in trying to read both sides of a postcard at once Which explanation
being of the Captains own brand of humor pleased the latter immensely

Maybe youre right MaryGusta he chuckled Maybe thats what
twas Seth the postmaster is pure rubber so far as other folks mail
is concerned maybe he stretched the rubber too far this time and it
snapped

Zoeth did not joke muchjoking was not in his linebut he showed
his relief at the improvement in the firms affairs in quieter but as
unmistakable ways When Mary was at the desk in the evenings after the
store had closed busy with the books he would come and sit beside her
saying little but occasionally laying his hand gently on her shoulder
or patting her arm and regarding her with a look so brimful of love and
gratitude that it made her feel almost guilty and entirely unworthy

Dont Uncle Zoeth she protested on one such occasion Dont look
at me like that IIReally you make me feel ashamed I havent done
anything I am not doing half enough

He shook his head

Youre doin too much Im afraid MaryGusta he said Youre
givin up everything a girl like you had ought to have and that your
Uncle Shadrach and I had meant you should have Youre givin it up just
for us and it aint right We aint worthy of it

Hush hush Uncle Zoeth Please When I think what you have given up
for me

Twant nothin MaryGusta You came to your Uncle Shadrach and to
me just when we needed somethin to keep our lives sweet Mine especial
was bitter and there was danger twould always be so And then we
brought you over from Ostable in the old buggy andand the Almightys
sunshine came with you You was His angel Yes sir His angel thats
what you was only we didnt know it then I was pretty sore and bitter
in those days thought I never could forget And yetand yet now I
really am forgettinor if I dont forget Im more reconciled And
youve done it for me MaryGusta

Mary was puzzled Forget what she asked Do you mean the business
troubles Uncle Zoeth

Zoeth seemed to waken from a sort of dream Business troubles
he repeated No no long long afore that these troubles were
MaryGusta Dont lets talk about em I cant talk about em even
nowand I mustnt think There are some troubles thatthat He
caught his breath and his tone changed I called you an angel just now
dearie he went on Well you was and you are There are angels in
this worldbut theres devils tootheres devils too There the
Lord forgive me What am I talkin about Well forget whats gone and
be thankful for whats here Give your old uncle a kiss MaryGusta

He was happy in Marys society and happy in the steady improvement of
the business but the girl and Captain Shadrach were a little worried
concerning his general health For years he had not been a very strong
or active man but now he looked paler and more frail than ever He
walked to and from the store and house several times a day but he
retired almost as soon as he entered the house at night and his appetite
was not good

His nerves aint back where theyd ought to be declared Shadrach He
was awful shook up when it looked as if Hamilton and Company was goin
to founder He didnt keep blowin off steam about it the way I didmy
safetyvalves always openbut he kept it all inside his biler and its
put his engine out of gear Hell get along all right so longs its
smooth sailin but what Im afraid of is a rock showin up in the
channel unexpected The doctor told me that Zoeth mustnt worry any more
and he mustnt work too hard Moren all he mustnt have any scares or
shocks or anything like that

We must try to see that he doesnt have any said Mary

Sartin sure we must but you cant always see those things in time to
head em off Now take my own case I had a shock this mornin Rastus
Young paid me a dollar on account

WHAT Rastus Young PAID you

Well I dont knows he paid it exactly He borrowed the dollar of
one of those summer fellers over at Cahoons boardin house and he was
tellin Ab Bacheldor about it at the corner by the postoffice Ab
naturally didnt believe any sane man would lend Rastus anything so he
wanted proof Rastus hauled the dollar out of his pocket to show and I
who happened to be standin behind em without their knowin it reached
out and grabbed it

You did Why Uncle Shad

Yes I told Rastus Id credit his account with it but I dont knows
I hadnt ought to give it back to the summer feller Anyhow gettin it
was a shock same as I said at the beginnin Rastus says hes goin to
sue me I told him Id have sued HIM long ago if Id supposed he could
STEAL a dollar let alone borrow one




CHAPTER XXII


It was late in August when Mary received the letter from Crawford in
which he told of his determination to wait no longer but to tell his
father of his love for her Edwin Smith was much better By way of
proof his son inclosed a photograph which he had taken of his father
sitting beneath a tree on the lawn of their home The picture showed Mr
Smith without his beard which had been shaved off during his illness
Either this or the illness itself had changed him a great deal He
looked thinner and which was odd under the circumstances younger
Mary looking at this photograph felt more than ever the impossible
conviction that somewhere or other at some time in her life she must
have met Mr Edwin Smith


So in my next letter wrote Crawford I shall have news to tell And
I am sure it will be good news Ask your father first you said Of
course you remember that and I have remembered it every moment since
Now I am going to ask him After that you will give me your answer
wont you And it cant be anything but yes because I wont let it be


What Marys feelings were when she received this letter whether or not
she slept as soundly that night and other nights immediately following
whether or not the sight of Isaiah returning from the postoffice at
mail times caused her breath to come a little quicker and her nerves
to thrillthese are questions the answers to which must be guessed
Suffice it to say that she manifested no marked symptoms of impatience
and anxiety during that week and when at last Isaiah handed her another
letter postmarked Carson City the trembling of the hand which received
it was so slight as to be unnoticed by Mr Chase

She put aside the letter until that night when she was alone in her
room Then she opened it and read what Crawford had written His father
had not only refused consent to his sons contemplated marriage but had
manifested such extraordinary agitation and such savage and unreasonable
obstinacy that Crawford was almost inclined to believe his parents
recent illness had affected his mind


That is the only explanation I can think of he wrote It seems as if
he must be insane And yet he seemed rational enough at the beginning
of our first interview and during most of the second Even when I
had broken the news that there was a girl in whom I felt an especial
interest he did not show any sign of the outbreak that came afterward
It wasnt until I began to tell how I first met you there at South
Harniss who you were and about Captain Gould and Mr Hamilton that I
noticed he was acting queerly I was head over heels in my story trying
to make plain how desperate my case was and doing my best to make him
appreciate how tremendously lucky his son was to have even a glimmer of
a chance to get a girl like you for a wife when I heard him make an odd
noise in his throat I looked upI dont know where I had been looking
beforecertainly not at himand there he was leaning back in his
chair his face as white as his collar and waving a hand at me I
thought he was choking or was desperately ill or something and I
sprang toward him but he waved me back Stop Wait he said or
stammered or choked it was more like a croak than a human voice
Dont come here Let me be What are you trying to tell me Whowho
is this girl I asked him what was the matterhis manner and his look
frightened mebut he wouldnt answer kept ordering me to tell him
again who you were So I did tell him that you were the daughter of
the Reverend Charles Lathrop and Augusta Lathrop and of your mothers
second marriage to Captain Marcellus Hall But he died when she was
seven years old I went on and since that time she has been living
with her guardians the two fine old fellows who adopted her Captain
Shadrach Gould and Zoeth Hamilton They live at South Harniss on
Cape Cod I had gotten no further than this when he interrupted me
Sheshe has been living with Zoeth Hamilton he cried With Zoeth
Hamilton Oh my God Diddid Zoeth Hamilton send you to me Yes that
is exactly what he said Did Zoeth Hamilton send you to me I stared
at him Why no Dad I said as soon as I could say anything Of
course he didnt I have met Mr Hamilton but once in my life What
IS the matter Sit down again Dont you think I had better call the
doctor I thought surely his brain was going But no he wouldnt
answer or listen Instead he looked at me with the wildest craziest
expression and said Did Zoeth Hamilton tell you He told me nothing
Dad I said as gently as I could Of course he didnt I am almost a
stranger to him Besides what in the world was there to tell I came
to you because I had something to tell I mean to marry Mary Lathrop
if she will have me I got no further than that No he fairly
screamed No No No Oh my God no And then the doctor came running
in we got Dad to bed and it was all over for that day except that I
naturally was tremendously upset and consciencestricken I could see
that the doctor thought I was to blame that I had confessed something
or othersomething criminal I imagine he surmisedto Dad and that it
had knocked the poor old chap over And I couldnt explain because what
I had told him was not for outsiders to hear

Well after a terribly anxious night and a worrisome forenoon the doctor
told me that father was himself again and wanted to see me at once
Ive said all I can against it said the doctor I dont know what
sort of rumpus you two had yesterday but it came dangerously near being
the finish for him And it must not be repeated Im making that as
emphatic as I can I assured him that so far as I was concerned there
would not be a scene and then went in to Dads room He looked white
enough and sick enough but he was rational and his mind was keen and
clear He got me to tell the whole story about you all over again and
he asked a lot of questions in fact he crossexamined me pretty
thoroughly When I had finished his tone was calm but I noticed that
his hand was shaking and he seemed to be holding himself in And so you
think you want to marry this downeast country girl do you he said
I certainly do said I He laughed a forced laughdidnt sound like
his at alland he said Well my boy youll get over it Its a whole
lot better to get over it now than to do so by and by when its too
late Its a good thing I called you home when I did You stay here and
keep on with your studies and Ill keep on getting into shape again By
next summer when we go on our fishing trip youll have forgotten all
about your DownEaster Well THAT was a staggerer coming from him It
didnt sound like him at all and again I had that feeling that his
mind was going You see Mary I never asked Dad for anything I didnt
getnever Now I wasnt asking I was just telling him what I had made
up my mind to have and he treated me this way I answered him calmly
and quietly telling him I was serious and what you meant to me He
wouldnt listen at first then when he did he wouldnt agree Pleaded
with mehe was lonesome I was his only son he needed me he couldnt
share me with anyone else and so on There is no use going into all the
details We didnt get any nearer an agreement we did get nearer and
nearer to bad temper on my part and shouts and hysterics on his So
I left him Mary That was last night I knew Dad was inclined to be
stubborn and I knew he had strong prejudices but I never imagined
he could behave like this to me And I am sure he would not if he were
himself So I shall say no more to him on the subject for a day or two
Then when he is better as I am hoping he may be soon he and I will
have another talk But understand Mary dear my mind was made up
before I spoke to him at all What he says or what he does will make no
difference so far as you and I are concerned I know you are a believer
in duty well so am I I would stick by Dad through thick and thin If
I knew he was right in asking me to do or not to do a thing even if I
knew he had been wrong in asking other things I would stick by him and
try to do as he asked But not this I love Dad God knows I do but I
love you Mary and as I have vowed to myself every day since I last saw
you I am going to marry you if you will only have me As for Dadwell
well hope within a day or two I may have better news to write


Mary read and reread the long letter Then she leaned back in her chair
and with the letter in her lap sat therethinking She had been right
in her forebodings it was as she had expected had foreseen Edwin
Smith man of affairs wealthy arbitrary eccentric accustomed to
having his own way and his prejudices however absurd respecteda man
with an only son for whom doubtless plans definite and ambitious had
been made could not be expected calmly to permit the upsetting of those
plans by his boys marriage to a poor DownEaster So much she had
foreseen from the first and she had never shared Crawfords absolute
confidence in his parents acquiescence She had been prepared
therefore to read that Mr Smith had refused his consent

But to be prepared for a probability and to face a certainty are quite
different It was the certainty she was facing now Unless Mr Smith
changed his mind and the chances were ten to one against that he and
his son would quarrel Crawford had inherited a portion of his fathers
stubbornness he was determined she knew He loved her and he meant
what he saidif she would have him he would marry her in spite of his
father It made her proud and happy to know that But she too was
resolute and had meant what she said She would not be the cause of a
separation between father and son And besides marriage had become
for her a matter of the distant future for the present her task was set
there at South Harniss

What should she do It was hard for Crawford poor fellow Yes but it
was hard for her too No one but she knew how hard He would write her
again telling her that his decision was unchanged begging her to
say she loved him pleading with her to wait for him And she would
waitOh how gladly how joyfully she could waitfor himif she knew
she was doing right in permitting him to wait for her If she was sure
that in permitting him to give up his fathers love and his home and
money and all that money could buy she was justified There is a love
which asks and a love which gives without asking return the latter is
the greater love and it was hers She had written Crawford that perhaps
she was not sure of her feeling toward him That was not true She was
sure but because she was fearful that his knowledge might be the means
of entailing a great sacrifice on his part she would not tell him

What should she do She considered as the little MaryGusta used to
consider her small problems in that very room And the result of her
considerations was rather unsatisfactory There was nothing she could
do now nothing but wait until she heard again from Crawford Then she
would write

She brushed her eyes with her handkerchief and read the letter again
There were parts of it which she could not understand She was almost
inclined to adopt Crawfords suggestion that his fathers mind might
have been affected by his illness Why had he received so passively the
news that his son had fallen in love and yet become so violent when told
the object of that love He did not know her Mary Lathrop there could
be no personal quality in his objection And what could he have meant by
asking if Zoeth Hamilton had sent Crawford to him That was absolutely
absurd Zoeth and Shadrach too had talked with Mary of Crawfords
people in the West but merely casually as of complete strangers
which of course they were It was all strange but explainable if one
considered that Mr Smith was weak and ill and perhaps flighty She
must not think any more about it nowthat is she must try not to
think She must not give way and above all she must not permit her
uncles to suspect that she was troubled She must try hard to put it
from her mind until Crawfords next letter came

But that letter did not come The week passed then another but there
was no word from Crawford Marys anxiety grew Each day as Isaiah
brought the mail she expected him to give her an envelope addressed
in the familiar handwriting but he did not She was growing
nervousalmost fearful And then came a happening the shock of which
drove everything else from her mind for the time and substituted for
that fear another

It was a Tuesday and one oclock Mary and Captain Shadrach having had
an early dinner had returned to the store Zoeth upon their arrival
went down to the house for his own meal Business which had been very
good indeed was rather slack just then and Shadrach and Mary were
talking together Suddenly they heard the sound of rapid footsteps in
the lane outside

Whos hoofin it up to the main road at that rate demanded the
Captain lounging lazily toward the window Has the town pump got on
fire or is somebody goin for the doctor

He leaned forward to look His laziness vanished

Eh Jumpin Judas he cried springing to the door Its Isaiah and
runnin as if the Old Boy was after him Here You Isaiah Whats the
matter

Isaiah pounded up the platform steps and staggered against the doorpost
His face flamed so red that as Shadrach said afterward it was a
wonder the perspiration didnt bile

III he stammered IOh dear me What shall I do Hehehes
there on the floor andandOh my godfreys Im all out of wind What
SHALL I do

Talk roared the Captain Talk Use what wind youve got for that
Whats happened Sing out

Heshes all alone there panted Mr Chase He wont speak
scurcelyonly moans I dont knows he aint dead

Whos dead Who Who Who The irate Shadrach seized his steward by
the collar and shook him not too gently Whos dead he bellowed
Somebody will be next door to dead right here in a minute if you dont
speak up instead of snortin like a puffin pig Whats happened

Isaiah swallowed gasped and waved a desperate hand Let go of me he
protested Zoethhehes down in a heap on the kitchen floor Hes
had aa stroke or somethin

God Amighty cried Shadrach and bolted out of the door Mary
followed him and a moment later Mr Chase followed her The store was
left to take care of itself

They found poor Zoeth not exactly in a heap on the floor of the kitchen
but partially propped against one of the kitchen chairs He was not
unconscious but could speak only with difficulty They carried him to
the bedroom and Isaiah was sent on another gallop after the doctor When
the latter came he gave his patient a thorough examination and emerged
from the sickroom looking grave

You must get a nurse he said This is likely to last a long while
It is a slight paralytic stroke I should say though what brought it
on I havent the least idea Has Mr Hamilton had any sudden shock or
fright or anything of that sort

He had not so far as anyone knew Isaiah being questioned told of
Zoeths coming in for dinner and of hisIsaiahshanding him the
mornings mail

I fetched it myself down from the postoffice said Isaiah There was
a couple of Hamilton and Company letters and the Wellmouth Register and
one of them circulum advertisements about SoandSos horse liniment
and andyes seems to me there was a letter for Zoeth himself He took
em all and sot down in the kitchen to look em over I went into the
dininroom Next thing I knew I heard him say O God just like
that

Avast heavin Isaiah put in Captain Shadrach Youre way off your
course Zoeth never said that Thats the way I talk but he dont

He done it this time persisted Isaiah I turned and looked through
the doorway at him and he was standin in the middle of the kitchen
floor Seems to me he had a piece of white paper in his handseems if
he did And then afore I could say a word he kind of groaned and sunk
down inin a pile as you might say right on the floor And I couldnt
get him up nor get him to speak to me nor nothin Yet he must have
come to enough to move after I left and to crawl acrost and lean against
that chair

The horse liniment circular and the Wellmouth Register were there on the
kitchen table just where Mr Hamilton had laid them There also were
the two letters addressed to Hamilton and Company Of the letter which
Isaiah seemed to remember as addressed to Zoeth personally there was no
sign

Are you sure there was such a letter Isaiah asked Mary

Mr Chase was not sure that is to say he was not sure more than a
minute at a time The minute following he was inclined to think he might
have been mistaken perhaps it was yesterday or the day before or even
last week that his employer received such a letter

Captain Shadrach lost patience

Sure twant last Thanksgivin he demanded Are you sure about
anything Are you sure how old you are

No by godfreys I aint roared Isaiah in desperation Im so upsot
ever since I looked into that kitchen and see the poor soul down on the
floor there thatthat all Im sure of is that I aint sure of nothin

Well I dont knows I blame you much Isaiah grunted the Captain
Anyway it doesnt make much difference about that letter so fur as I
see whether there was one or not What did you want to know for Mary

Mary hesitated Why she answered Iperhaps it is foolish but the
doctor said something about a shock being responsible for this dreadful
thing and I didnt knowI thought perhaps there might have been
something in that letter which shocked or alarmed Uncle Zoeth Of course
it isnt probable that there was

Shadrach shook his head

I guess not he said I cant think of any letter hed get of that
kind Theres nobody to write it He aint got any relations nigher than
third cousin Zoeth aint Anyhow we mustnt stop to guess riddles
now Ill hunt up the letter by and by if there was one and I happen to
think of it Now Ive got to hunt up a nurse

The nurse was found a Mrs Deborah Atkins of Ostable and she arrived
that night bag and baggage and took charge of the patient Deborah was
not ornamental being elderly and as Captain Shadrach said built for
tonnage more than speed but she was sensible and capable Also her fee
was not excessive although that was by no means the principal reason
for her selection

Never mind what it costs said Mary Get the best you can Its for
Uncle Zoeth remember

Shadrachs voice shook a little as he answered

I aint likely to forget he said Zoeth and Ive cruised together
for a good many years and if one of us has to go under Id rather twas
me I havent got much money but what Ive got is his and after that
so long as I can get trusted But there with an attempt at optimism
dont you fret MaryGusta Nobodys goin under yet Well have Zoeth
up on deck doin the fishers hornpipe in a couple of weeks

But it was soon plain to everyone the Captain included that many times
two weeks must elapse before Mr Hamilton would be able to appear on
deck again to say nothing of dancing hornpipes For days he lay in
partial coma rallying occasionally and speaking at rare intervals but
evidently never fully aware of where he was and what had happened

He will recover I think said the doctor but it will be a slow
job

Mary did not again refer to the letter regarding which Isaiahs memory
was so befogged In fact she forgot it entirely So also did Captain
Shad For both the worry of Zoeths illness and the care of the store
were sufficient to drive trifles from their minds

And for Mary there was another trouble one which she must keep to
herself Three weeks had elapsed since Crawfords letter that telling
of his two fateful interviews with his father and still no word had
come from him Mary could not understand his silence In vain she called
her philosophy to her rescue striving to think that after all it was
best if she never heard from him again best that a love affair which
could never end happily were ended at once best that he should come to
see the question as his father saw itbest for him that is for
his future would then be one of ease and happiness All this she
thoughtand then found herself wondering why he had not written
imagining all sorts of direful happenings and feeling herself
responsible




CHAPTER XXIII


One evening about a week after Mr Hamiltons sudden seizure Mary was
in her room alone She had again reread Crawfords latest letter and was
sitting there trying to imagine the scene as he had described it She
was trying to picture Edwin Smith the man whoas his son had so often
told herindulged that sons every whim was kindness and parental love
personified and yet had raved and stormed like a madman because the boy
wished to marry her Mary Lathrop

She rose opened the drawer of her bureau and took out the photograph
of Mr Smith the one which showed him without his beard the one taken
since his illness Crawford had written that this photograph too had
been taken on the sly

Dads prejudice against photos is as keen as ever he wrote He would
slaughter me on the spot if he knew I had snapped him

The face in the picture was not that of the savage unrelenting
parent of the old plays who used to disinherit his sons and drive his
daughters out into blinding snowstorms because they dared thwart his
imperial will Edwin Smith was distinctly a handsome man grayhaired
of course and strongfeatured but with a kind rather than a stern
expression As Mary had said when she first saw his likeness he looked
as if he might have had experiences In this photograph he looked very
grave almost sad but possibly that was because of his recent sickness

She was looking at the picture when Isaiahs voice was heard outside the
door

Hi MaryGusta whispered Mr Chase Aint turned in yet have you
Can I speak with you a minute

Certainly Isaiah said Mary Come in

Isaiah entered Twant nothin special he said I was just goin to
tell you that Debby T callates Zoeth is a little mite easier tonight
She just said so and I thought youd like to know

By Debby T Isaiah meant Mrs Atkins Mary understood

Thank you Isaiah she said I am ever so glad to hear it Thank you
for telling me

Thats all right MaryGusta Hello whos tintypes that

He had caught sight of the photograph upon the arm of Marys chair He
picked it up and looked at it She heard him gasp Turning she saw
him staring at the photograph with an expression of absolute
amazementamazement and alarm

Why Isaiah she cried What is the matter

Isaiah not taking his eyes from the picture extended it in one hand
and pointed to it excitedly with the other

For godfreys mighty sakes he demanded Where did you get that

Get what The photograph

Yes Yes yes Whered you get it Whered it come from

It was sent to me What of it What is the matter

Isaiah answered neither question He seemed to have heard only the first
sentence

SENT to you he repeated MaryGusta Lathrop have you been tryin
to find outLook here who sent you Ed Farmers picture

Mary stared at him WHOSE picture she said What are you talking
about Isaiah

Isaiah thrust the photograph still closer to the end of her nose Also
he continued to point at it

Who sent you Ed Farmers picture he repeated Wherewhered you get
it You tell me now

Mary looked him over from head to foot

I dont know whether to send for Uncle Shad or the doctor she said
slowly If you dont stop hopping up and down and waving your arms as
if they worked by strings I shall probably send for both Isaiah Chase
behave yourself What is the matter with you

Isaiah during his years as sea cook had learned to obey orders Marys
tone had its effect upon him He dropped one hand but he still held
the photograph in the other And he stared at it as if it possessed some
sort of horrible charm which frightened and fascinated at the same time
Mary had never seen him so excited

Ed Farmer he exclaimed Oh I swan to man I dont see howSay it
IS him aint it MaryGusta But of course tis I can see tis with
my own eyes My godfreys mighty

Mary shook her head If I didnt know you were a blue ribboner
Isaiah she said I should be suspicious That photograph was sent me
from the West It is a picture of a gentleman named Edwin Smith someone
I have never seen and Im perfectly sure you never have Why in the
world it should make you behave as if you needed a straitjacket I cant
see Does Mr Smith resemble someone you know

Isaiahs mouth fell open and remained so as he gazed first at the
photograph and then at her

EdEdwin Smith he repeated Edwin Smith II dont know no Edwin
Smith Look here now honest MaryGusta AINT that a picture of Ed
Farmer

Mary laughed Of course it isnt she said Who is Ed Farmer pray

Isaiah did not answer He was holding the photograph near the end of his
own nose now and examining it with eager scrutiny muttering comments as
he did so

If it aint him its a better picture than if twas was one of his
amazing observations Dont seem as if two folks could look so much
alike and not be And yetand yet I can seeI can see nowthis
fellers hairs pretty nigh white and Eds was dark brown But then
if this feller was Ed hed behed belets seehed be all of
thirtyfive years older than he was thirtyfive years ago and that would
account

Mary burst out laughing

Do be still Isaiah she broke in You are perfectly idiotic That
mans name is Smith I tell you

Mr Chase heaved a sigh Youre sartin tis he asked

Of course I am

Well then I callate it must be But if Ed Farmer had lived all these
years and had had his tintype took he wouldnt get one to favor him more
than that does I bet you My it give me a start comin onto me so
unexpected

But who is Ed Farmer asked Mary The name had meant nothing to her so
far And yet even as she spoke she remembered Her expression changed

Do you mean she cried eagerly Why Isaiah do you mean the man in
that old photograph I found in the garret ever and ever so long ago The
one you told me was aa blackguard

Isaiah still staring at Mr Smiths likeness answered emphatically

Thats the one he said Thats the one I meant My this feller does
look like him or the way I callate he would look if he lived as long
as this

Is he dead then

I dont know We dont any of us know around here I aint laid eyes on
him since the day afore it happened I remember just as well as if twas
yesterday He come out of the office onto the wharf where I was workin
and he says to me Isaiah he says knockin on the head of a barrel
with his handthe right hand twas the one that had the bent finger
he got it smashed under a hogshead of salt one time and it never came
straight againIsaiah says he its a nice day aint it And
I answered up promptI liked him fustrate everybody liked him them
daysYes sir I says this is a good enough day to go see your best
girl in I never meant nothin by it you understand just a sayin
twas but it seemed to give him a kind of start He looked at me hard
Did anyone tell you where I was goin says he sharp Why no says
I Why should they He didnt answer just kept on starin at me Then
he laughed and walked away I didnt know where he was goin then but I
know now darn him And the next day he wentfor good

He stopped speaking Mary waited a moment and then asked quietly Went
where Isaiah Where did he go

Isaiah who was standing the photograph still in his hand started
turned and looked at her

Whats that he asked

I say where did this Mr Farmer go

Eh Oh I dont know He went away thats all Dont ask me any more
questions Ive been talkin too much anyhow I callate Capn
Shad would skin me alive if he knew Id said as much as I have Say
MaryGusta dont you say nothin to either him or Zoeth will you
You seeitsits a kind of little secret we have amongst us andand
nobody else is in on it Twas this plaguey tintype got me to talkin
No wonder neither I never see such a look on two folks Ithere
there Good night MaryGusta good night

He tossed the photograph on the bureau and hurried out of the room Mary
called after him but he would neither stop nor answer

After he had gone Mary took up the photograph seated herself once more
in the chair and studied the picture for a long time Then she rose
and lamp in hand left the room tiptoed along the hall past the door
of Captain Shadrachs room and up the narrow stairs to the attic her
old playground

Her playthings were there still arranged in her customary orderly
fashion along the walls Rose and Rosette and Minnehaha and the other
dolls were seated in their chairs or the doll carriage or with their
backs against Shadrachs old sea chest She had never put them away out
of sight Somehow it seemed more like home to her the knowledge that
though she would never play with them again they were there waiting
for her in their old places While she was away at school they had been
covered from the dust by a cloth but now the cloth had been taken away
and she herself dusted them every other morning before going up to the
store As Shadrach said no one but MaryGusta would ever have thought
of doing such a thing She did because she WAS MaryGusta

However the dolls did not interest her now She tiptoed across the
garret floor taking great care to avoid the boards which creaked most
and lifted the lid of the old trunk which she had first opened on that
Saturday afternoon nearly ten years before She found the pocket on
the under side of the lid opened it and inserted her hand Yes the
photograph of Hall and Company was still there she could feel the edge
of it with her fingers

She took it out and closed the pocket and then the trunk and tiptoed
down the stairs and to her room again She closed the door locked
itsomething she had never done in her life beforeand placing
the photograph she had taken from the trunk beside that sent her by
Crawford sat down to compare them

And as she looked at the two photographs her wonder at Isaiahs odd
behavior ceased It was not strange that when he saw Mr Edwin Smiths
likeness he was astonished it was not remarkable that he could scarcely
be convinced the photograph was not that of the mysterious Ed Farmer
For here in the old yellow photograph of the firm of Hall and Company
Wholesale Fish Dealers was Edgar S Farmer and here in the photograph
sent her by Crawford was Edwin Smith And save that Edgar S Farmer
was a young man and Edwin Smith a man in the middle sixties they were
almost identical in appearance Each time she had seen Mr Smiths
photograph she had felt certain she must have met the original Here was
the reasonthis man in the other photograph The only difference was
the difference of age Edwin Smith had a nose like Edgar Farmers and
a chin like his and eyes like his And Isaiah had just said that Edgar
Farmer had a crooked finger on his right hand caused by an accident with
a hogshead of salt Mary remembered well something Crawford had told
her that his father had a finger on the right hand which had been hurt
in a mine years before he Crawford was born

It could not be of courseit could not beand yetOh WHAT did it
mean




CHAPTER XXIV


In his own room at the end of the secondstory hall over the kitchen
Mr Chase was sitting reading the local paper before retiring It was a
habit he had one of which Captain Shadrach pretended to approve highly
Best thing in the world Isaiah declared the Captain Sleeps what
everybody needs and I cant think of any surer way of gettin to sleep
than readin the South Harniss news in that paper

Whether or not this unkind joke was deserved is not material at all
events Isaiah was reading the paper when he was very much startled by a
knock at the door

Whowho is it he stammered

It is Mary whispered a voice outside the door I want to speak with
you Isaiah Youre not in bed are you

Isaiah reluctantly relinquished the paper No no he replied I
aint in bed Whats the matter Zoeth aint no worse is he

Let me in and Ill tell you

Come on in You dont need no lettin

Mary entered She was very grave and very earnest

What in the nation began Isaiah are you prowlin around this hour
of the night for

Hush Isaiah you must tell me everything now Theres no use to say
you wontyou MUST Who was Edgar Farmer and what wrong did he do my
uncles

Isaiah said nothing he did not attempt to answer Instead he gaped at
her with such an expression of guilty surprise fright and apprehension
that at any other time she would have laughed Just now however she
was far from laughing

Come come she said impatiently I mean it I want you to tell me
all about this Edgar Farmer

Nownow MaryGusta I told you

You told me a very little Now I want to know the rest Everyone else
in this family knows it and it is time I did Im not a child any more
Tell me the whole story Isaiah

I shant neither Oh by godfreys this is what I get by sayin moren
I ought to And yet how could I help it when I see that tintype Its
just my luck Nobody else but me would have had the dratted luck to have
that picture stuck into their face and eyes unexpected And twas just
so when you found that other one years ago up attic I had to be the one
you sprung it on I had to be But I shant tell you nothin

Yes you will You must tell me everything

Well I shant

Very well Then I shall go straight to Uncle Shad

To who To CAPN SHAD Oh my godfreys mighty You go to him and see
what hell say Just go Why hed shut up tightern a clam at low
water and hed give you fits besides Go to Capn Shad and ask about Ed
Farmer My soul You try it Aw dont be foolish MaryGusta

Im not going to be foolish Isaiah If I go to Uncle Shad I shall tell
him that it was through you I learned there was such a person as the
Farmer man and that there was a secret connected with him that it was a
disagreeable secret that

Hush Land sakes alive MaryGusta DONT talk so Why if you told
Capn Shad hedI dont know what he wouldnt do to me If he knew I
told you about Ed Farmer hedI swan to man I believe hed pretty nigh
kill me

Well youll soon know what he will do for unless you tell me the
whole story I shall certainly go to him

Aw MaryGusta

I surely shall And if he wont tell me I shall go to someone outside
the familyto Judge Baxter perhaps He would tell me Im sure if
I asked No Isaiah you tell me And if you do tell me all freely and
frankly keeping nothing back Ill say nothing to Uncle Shad or Uncle
Zoeth They shall never know who told

Mr Chase wrung his hands Ever since he had been cook at the white
house by the shore he had had this duty laid upon him the duty of
keeping his lips closed upon the name of Edgar Farmer and the story
connected with that name When Captain Shadrach first engaged him for
his present situation the Captain had ordered him never to speak the
name or mention the happenings of that time And after little Mary
Lathrop became a regular and most important member of the family the
command was repeated She mustnt ever know if we can help it Isaiah
said Shadrach solemnly You know Zoeth and how he feels For his sake
if nothin else we mustnt any of us drop a hint so that she will know
Shell find out I presume likely when she gets older therell be some
kind soul around town thatll tell her consarn em but WE shant tell
her and if YOU tell her Isaiah Chase IllI declare to man Ill
heave you overboard

And now after all these years of ignorance during which the expected had
not happened and no one of the village gossips had revealed the secret
to hernow here she was demanding that he Isaiah Chase reveal it
and threatening to go straight to Captain Gould and tell who had put
her upon the scent No wonder the cook and steward wrung his hands in
despair the heaving overboard was imminent

Mary earnest and determined as she was to learn the truth the
truth which she was beginning to believe might mean so much to her
nevertheless could not help pitying him

Come come Isaiah she said dont look so tragic There isnt
anything so dreadful about it Have you promisedhave you given your
word not to tell Because if you have I shant ask you to break it
I shall go to Judge Baxter insteador to Uncle Shad But of course I
shall be obliged to tell how I came to knowthe little I do know

Mr Chase did not like the prospect of her going to the Captain that
was plain For the first time his obstinacy seemed to waver

II dont knows I ever give my word he admitted I never promised
nothin as I recollect Capn Shad he give me orders

Yes yes of course he did Well now IM giving you orders And I
promise you Isaiah if it ever becomes necessary Ill stand between you
and Uncle Shad Now tell me

Isaiah sat down upon the bed and wiped his forehead

Oh Lordy he moaned I wisht my mouth had been sewed up afore ever
I said a word about any of it    Butbut    Well desperately
what is it you want to know

I want to know everything Begin at the beginning and tell me who Mr
Farmer was

Mr Chase marked a pattern on the floor with his slippered foot Then he
began

He come from up Cape Ann way in the beginnin he said The rest of
the firm was Cape Codders but he want However hed been afishin
and he knew fish and after the firm was fust started and needed an extry
bookkeeper he applied and got the job There was three of em in Hall
and Company at fust all young men they was too your stepfather Capn
Marcellus Hall he was the head one and Mr Zoeth he was next and
Capn Shad next Twant until three or four year afterwards that Ed
Farmer was took in partner He was so smart and done so well they give
him a share and took him in

Everybody liked him too He was younger even than the rest and fine
lookin and he had aa kind of way with him that just made you like
him The way the business was handled was somethin like this Capn
Marcellus your stepfather MaryGusta he and Capn Shad done the
outside managin bossin the menwe had a lot of em on the wharf them
days too and there was always schooners unloadin and carts loadin up
and fellers headin up barrelsOh Hall and Companys store and docks
was the busiest place on the South Shore You ask anybody that remembers
and theyll tell you so

Well Capn Marcellus and Capn Shad was sort of outside bosses same
as I said and Zoeth he was sort of general business boss tendin to
the buyin supplies and payin for em and gettin money and the like of
that and EdEdgar Farmer I meanhe was inside office boss lookin
out for the books and the collections and the bank account and so on
Marcellus and Zoeth and Capn Shad was old chums and had been for years
they was as much to each other as brothers and always had been but it
want so very long afore they thought as much of Farmer as they did of
themselves He was that kindyou couldnt help takin a notion to him

When I get to talkin about Hall and Company I could talk for a month
of Sundays Them was great daysyes sir great days for South Harniss
and the fish business Why Ive seen of a Saturday mornin in the
mackerel season as many as forty men ashore right here in town with
money in their pockets and their hats on onesided lookin for fun or
trouble just as happened along And Capn Marcellus and his partners was
looked up to and respected not much moren boys they want but they
was bigbugs I tell you and they wore beaver hats to church on Sunday
every man jack of em Furs that goes I wore one too and you might
not think it but twas becomin to me if I do say it Yes siree
Twas a kind of curlup brim one that hat was and

Never mind the hat now Isaiah interrupted Mary Tell me about Mr
Farmer

Isaiah looked offended I am tellin you aint I he demanded Aint
I tellin you fast as I can

Perhaps you are We wont argue about it Go on

Wellwell where was I Youve put me clear off my course

You were just going to tell me what Mr Farmer did

What he did What didnt he do youd better say The blackguard
He smashed the firm flat thats what he done And he run off with
Marcelluss sister

Marcelluss sister My stepfathers sister I didnt know he ever had a
sister Are you sure he had

Am I sure What kind of talks that Course Im sure She was younger
than Marcellus and prettysay she WAS pretty Yes the outside of her
figurehead was mighty hard to beat everybody said so but the inside
was kind ofwell kind of rattly as you might say Shed laugh and
talk and go on and Ed Farmer hed hang over the desk there in the office
and look at her Just lookand lookand look How many times Ive
seen em that way It got so that folks begun to talk a little mite
Marcellus didnt of course he idolized that girl worshiped her like
a vain thing sos to speak And Capn Shad course he wouldnt talk
because hes always down on tattletales and liars but Ive always
thought he was a little mite suspicious and troubled As for poor
Zoethwell its always his kind that are the last to suspect And
Zoeth was as innocent then as he is now And as good too

And then one day it come out come down on us like the mainmast goin
by the board No come to think of it it didnt come all to once that
way Part of it did but the rest didnt The rest kind of leaked out
along slow gettin a little mite worse every day I can see it just as
plain as if twas yesterdayMarcellus and Shadrach in the office goin
over the books and addin up on pieces of paper and it gettin worse
and worse all the time And the whole town atalkin And poor
Zoeth lyin in his bedroom there to home out of his mind and ravin
distracted and beggin and pleadin with his partners not to chase em
to let em go free for her sake And the doctor acomin And

Mary began to feel that she too was in danger of raving distraction
Between her anxiety to hear the story and her forebodings and growing
suspicions she was becoming more and more nervous as Isaiah rambled on

Wait Wait please Isaiah she begged I dont understand What had
happened

Isaiah regarded her with surprise and impatience

Aint I been tellin you he snapped testily Aint I this minute
told you This Ed Farmer had cleared out and run off and hed took
with him every cent of Hall and Companys money that he could rake and
scrape Hed been stealin and speculatin for years it turned out
Twas him the dum thief him and his stealins that made the firm fail
Want that enough to happen Id like to know But that want all no
sir that want the worst of it

He paused evidently expecting his hearer to make some comment She was
leaning forward her eyes fixed upon his face but she did not speak
Mr Chase judging by her expression that he had created the sensation
which as storyteller he considered his due went on

No siree that want the worst of it You and me might have thought
losin all our money was the worst that could be but Marcellus
and Shadrach didnt think so Marcellus was pretty nigh stove in
himselfthere was nothin on earth he loved the way he loved that
sister of hisbut when he and Capn Shad thought of poor Zoeth they
couldnt think of much else Shadrach had liked her and Marcellus had
loved her but Zoeth had fairly bowed down and worshiped the ground she
trod on Anything she wanted no matter what she could have if twas in
Zoeths power to get it for her Hed humored her and spiled her as if
she was a child and all he asked for doin it was that shed pat him
on the head once in a while same as you would a dog And now shed
gonerun off with that thief Why

Mary interrupted again Wait Wait Isaiah she cried I tell you I
dont understand You sayyou say Captain Halls sister had gone with
Mr Farmer

Sartin she run off with him and nobodys laid eyes on either of em
since That was why

Stop stop What I dont understand is why Uncle Zoeth was so stricken
by the news Why had HE humored and spoiled her Was he in love with
her

Isaiah stared at her in blank astonishment

In love with her he repeated Course he was Why wouldnt he be
Want she his wife

There was no doubt about the sensation now The color slowly faded from
Marys cheeks

His WIFE she repeated slowly

Sartin Theyd been married most five year Didnt I tell you She was
a good deal youngern he was but

Wait Whatwhat was her name

Eh Didnt I tell you that neither Thats funny Her name was
PatiencePatience Hall

The last doubt was gone Clear and distinct to Marys mind came a
sentence of Crawfords I saw her name first on the gravestone and it
made an impression on me because it was so quaint and oldfashioned
Patience wife of Edwin Smith

She heard very little of Isaiahs story thereafter Scattered sentences
reached her ears Isaiah was telling how because of Zoeths pleading
and the latters desire to avoid all the public scandal possible no
attempt was made to trace the fugitives

They went West somewheres said Isaiah Anyhow twas supposed they
did cause they was seen together on the Chicago train by an Orham man
that knew Farmer Anybody but Marcellus and your uncles MaryGusta
would have sot the sheriff on their track and hauled em back here and
made that Farmer swab give up what he stole I dont imagine he had such
a terrible lot with him I callate the heft of it had gone in stock
speculatin but he must have had somethin and they could have got
aholt of that But no Zoeth he says Dont follow em For her sake
and minedont make the shame more public than tis You see Zoeth
was the same then as he is now youd have thought HE was to blame to
hear him talk He never said a word against her then nor since A mighty
good man your Uncle Zoeth Hamilton is MaryGusta Saint on earth I
call him

He went on to tell how Marcellus and Shadrach had fought to keep the
firm on its feet how for a time it struggled on against the load of
debt left it by their former partner only to go down at last

Marcellus went down with it as you might say continued Isaiah
Between losin his sister and losin his business he never was the same
man afterwards though he did make considerble money in other ways Him
and Capn Shadrach both went back to seafarin again and after a spell
I went with em Poor Zoeth when he got on his feet which took a long
spell he started a little store that by and by when Capn Shad joined
in with him was Hamilton and Company same as now And when Shadrach
come I come too as cook and steward you understand But from that
day to this theres been two names never mentioned in this house ones
Patience Halls and tothers Ed Farmers You can see now why when I
thought that tintype was his I was so took aback You see dont you
MaryGusta Why Where you goin

Mary had risen from her chair taken up the lamp and was on her way to
the door

Im going to my room she said Good night Isaiah

What are you goin now for I could tell you a lot more particlars if
you wanted to hear em Now Ive told so much I might as well tell the
rest If Im goin to be hove overboard for tellin I might as well make
a big splash as a little one If you got any questions to ask heave
ahead and ask em Fire away I dont care he added recklessly

But Mary shook her head She did not even turn to look at him

Perhaps I may ask them some other time she said Not now Thank you
for telling me so much Good night

Alone in her own room once more she sat down to think It was plain
enough now All the parts of the puzzle fitted together Edwin Smith
having been proved to be Edgar Farmer everything was explainable It
had seemed queer to her Mr Smiths aversion to the East his refusal
to come East even to his sons graduation but it was not at all queer
that Edgar Farmer the embezzler should feel such an aversion or
refuse to visit a locality where even after all these years he might
be recognized It was not odd that he disliked to be photographed And
it certainly was not strange that he should have behaved as he did
when his son announced the intention of marrying her Mary Lathrop
stepdaughter of one of his former partners and victims and adopted
niece and ward of the other two

What a terrible surprise and shock Crawfords communication must have
been to him The dead past the past he no doubt had believed buried
forever had risen from the tomb to confront him His only son the
boy he idolized who believed him to be a man of honor whose love and
respect meant more than the world to himhis only son asking to marry
the ward of the man whom he had wronged beyond mortal forgiveness
asking to marry her and intimating that he would marry her whether or
no And the secret which he had guarded so jealously had hidden from
his son and the world with such infinite pains suddenly threatening to
be cried aloud in the streets for all his boy included to hear Mary
shuddered as she realized what the man must have felt It must have
seemed to him like the direct hand of avenging Providence No wonder
he at first could not believe it to be merely accident coincidence no
wonder that he asked if Zoeth Hamilton had sent Crawford to him and had
demanded to know what Zoeth Hamilton had told

It was dreadful it was pitiful She found herself pitying Edwin
Smithor Edgar Farmereven though she knew the retribution which had
come upon him was deserved

She pitied himyes but now she could spare little pity for others she
needed as much herself For minute by minute as she sat there thinking
out this great problem just as the little MaryGusta used to think out
her small ones her duty became clear and more clear to her mind Edgar
Farmers secret must be kept For Crawfords sake it must be He need
nothe must notlearn that the father he had honored and respected all
his life was unworthy of that honor and respect And her unclesthey
must not know The old skeleton must not be dug from its grave Her
Uncle Zoeth had told her only a little while before that he was learning
to forget or if not to forget at least to be more reconciled She
did not understand him then now she did To have him learn that Edgar
Farmer was alive that his sonOh no he must not learn it Ill as he
was and weak as he was likely to be always the shock might kill him
And yet sooner or later he would learn unless the secret remained as it
had been for years undisclosed

And to keep it still a secret was she saw clearly her duty She might
rebel against it she might feel that it was wicked and cruel
the spoiling of her life to save these others but it was her duty
nevertheless Because she loved Crawfordand she was realizing now that
she did love him dearly that there could never be another love in the
world for hershe must send him away she must end the affair at
once If she did that she could save him from learning of his fathers
disgrace could avert the otherwise inevitable quarrel between them
could make his career and his future secure And her uncles would be
happy the skeleton would remain undisturbed

Yes she must do it But it was so hard to do Philosophy did not help
in the least She had tried to convince herself when she gave up her
school work that it meant the end of her romance also She had tried to
tell Crawford so But she had been weak she had permitted herself to
hope She had realized that for the present perhaps for years she must
work for and with the old men who had been father and mother both
to her buthe had said soCrawford would wait for her and some
dayperhaps

But now there was no perhapsnow she knew She must receive no more
letters from him She must never see him again The break must be
absolute and final And there was but one way to bring that about He
had said repeatedly that only her declaration that she did not love him
would ever prevent his marrying her Very well then for his sake she
must lie to him she must tell him that very thing She must write him
that she had been considering the matter and had decided she could never
love him enough to become his wife

It was almost two oclock when she reached this decision but she sat
down at her desk to write then and there the letter containing it the
last letter she would ever write him And when the morning light came
streaming in at the windows she still sat there the letter unwritten
She had made many beginnings but not an end She must try again she
was too tired too nervous too hopeless and heartbroken to make another
attempt that morning but before the day was over it should be done
She threw herself down upon the bed but she could not sleep Why had
she been selected to bear this burden What had she done that God should
delight to torture her in this way




CHAPTER XXV


That difficult letter was never written In the afternoon business at
the store being rather quiet and Mrs Atkins the nurse desiring an
hours leave to do an errand in the village Mary had taken her place
in the sickroom Zoeth was improving slowly so the doctor said but he
took very little interest in what went on speaking but seldom
asking few questions and seeming to be but partially sensible of his
surroundings Best not to try to rouse him the physician said Little
by little he would gain mentally as well as physically and by and
by there was reason to hope would be up and about again Probably
however he would never be so strong as he had been before his sudden
seizure the cause of whichif there had been a definite causewas
still unknown

Just then he was asleep and Mary sitting in the rockingchair by the
bed was thinking thinking thinking If she could only stop thinking
for a little while Uncle Zoeth there on the bed looked so calm and
peaceful If only she might have rest and peace again If she might be
allowed to forget

The door opened gently and Mr Chase appeared He beckoned to her to
come out With a glance at the patient she tiptoed from the room into
the hall

What is it Isaiah she asked

Isaiah seemed to be excited about something

Ive got a surprise for you MaryGusta he whispered Theres
somebody downstairs to see you

His manner was so important and mysterious that Mary was puzzled

Someone to see me she repeated Who is it

Mr Chase winked

Its somebody you want expectin to see I bet you he declared I
know I want When I opened the door and see him standin there I

Saw him Who Who is it Isaiah Stop that ridiculous winking this
instant Who is it

Its that young Crawford Smith feller from way out West thats who
tis Ah ha I told you youd be surprised

She was surprised there could be no doubt of that For a moment she
stood perfectly still Had it not been that the hall was almost dark in
the shadows of the late afternoon Isaiah would have noticed how pale
she had become But it was evident that he did not notice it for he
chuckled

I told you youd be some surprised he crowed Well aint you comin
on down to see him Seems to me if I had a beauexcuse me a gentleman
friendwho come acruisin all the way from tother side of creation to
see me I wouldnt keep him waitin very long Ho ho

Mary did not answer at once When she did she was surprised to find that
she was able to speak so calmly

I shall be down in a moment she said Isaiah will you please go in
and stay with Uncle Zoeth until I come

Isaiah looked chagrined and disappointed Visitors from the far West
were rare and especially rare was a young gentleman who Mr Chase with
what Captain Shadrach termed his lovesick imagination surmised was
MaryGustas beau He wished to see more of him

Aw say MaryGusta he pleaded Im awful busy I dont see how I
can set along of ZoethSay MaryGusta

But Mary had gone She was hurrying along the hall toward her own room
So Isaiah remembering that the doctor had said Mr Hamilton must not be
left alone grumblingly obeyed orders and went in to sit beside him

In her own room Mary stood white and shaken striving to regain her
composure She must regain it she must be cool and calm in order to go
through the ordeal she knew was before her His coming could mean but
one thing his father had still refused consent and he had come to tell
her so and to beg her to wait for him in spite of it If only he had
written saying he was coming if she had been forewarned then she
might have been more ready more prepared Now she must summon all her
resolution and be firm and unwavering Her purpose was as set and strong
as ever but ah it would be so hard to tell him To write the letter
she had meant to write would have been easy compared to this However
it must be doneand done now She went down the stairs and entered the
sittingroom

He was sitting in the rocker by the window and when she came into the
room he sprang to his feet and came toward her His face or so it
seemed to her showed some traces of the trouble and anxiety through
which he had passed so recently He was a little thinner and he looked
less boyish He held out his hands

Well Mary he cried eagerly here I am Arent you glad to see me

He seized both her hands in his She disengaged them gently Her manner
seemed odd to him and he regarded her in a puzzled way

ARENT you glad he repeated Why Mary what is the matter

She smiled sadly and shook her head Oh Crawford she said why did
you come Or at least why didnt you write me you were coming

He laughed I didnt write he answered because I was afraid if I
did you would write me not to come

I certainly should

Of course you would So I took no chances but just came instead

But why did you come

Why To see you of course

Oh Crawford please dont joke You know I asked you not to come here
When we last spoke together over the telephone I told you that if you
came here I should not see you And yet you came

His manner changed He was serious enough now

I came he said becausewell because I felt that I must I had
many things to tell you Mary and something to ask And I could
neither tell nor ask in a letter Dad and I have quarreledweve parted
company

She had expected to hear it but it shocked and grieved her
nevertheless She knew how he had loved his father

Sit down Crawford she said gently Sit down and tell me all about
it

He told her There was little more to tell than he had written His
father had not become more reconciled to the idea of his marrying Mary
Instead his opposition was just as violent and to his sons mind as
unreasonably absurd Day after day Crawford waited hoping that time
would bring a change or that his own arguments might have an effect but
neither time nor argument softened Edwin Smiths obstinacy

He behaved like a madman at times declared Crawford And at others
he would almost beg me on his knees to give you up I asked him why I
told him over and over again that he should be proud to have such a girl
for his daughterinlaw I said everything I could I told him I would
do anything for himanything he askedexcept give you up That I would
not do And it was the only thing he seemed to wish me to do Talked
about bringing shame and disgrace on his head and mineand all sorts of
wild nonsense When I asked what he meant by disgrace he could not tell
me Of course he couldnt

That was true of course he could not tell Mary knew and she realized
once more the tortures which the man must have suffered must be
suffering at that moment

So at last we parted said Crawford I left wordleft a letter
saying that so far as I could see it was best that I went away We
could not agree apparently he and I upon the one point which as I
saw it was the most important decision of my life And I had made that
decision I told him how much I hated to leave him that I loved him as
much as I ever did But I said I shall not give up my happiness and
my future merely to gratify your unreasonable whim Then I came away
and started East to you

He paused evidently expecting Mary to make some comment or ask a
question but she was silent After a moment he went on

I havent made any definite plans as yet he said I have another
year at the Medical Schoolor should have it I am hoping that I may
be able to go back to the Harvard Med here in Boston and work my
way through Other chaps have done it and Im sure I can And after
thatwell after that I must take my chance at finding a location and
a practice like any other young MD But first of all Mary I want
you to tell me that you will wait for me Its a lot to ask I know how
much But will you Mary dear Thats what Ive come here forto get
you to say that you will After that I can face anythingyes and win
out too

Mary looked at him His face was aglow with earnestness and his voice
shook as he finished speaking He rose and held out his hands

Will you Mary he begged

She looked at him no longer She was afraid to do soafraid of her own
weakness But no sign of that weakness showed itself in her tone as she
answered

Im sorry Crawford she said gently I wish I could but I cant

Cant Cant wait for me

I could wait for you it isnt that If it were merely a question of
waitingif that were allhow easy it would be But it isnt Crawford
you must go back to your father You must go back to him and forget all
about me You must

He stared at her for a moment Then he laughed

Forget you he repeated Mary are you

Oh please Crawford Dont make this any harder for both of us than it
has to be You must go back to your father and you must forget me I can
not marry you I cant

He came toward her

But Mary he cried IIOf course I know you cantnow I know
how you feel about your duty to your uncles I know they need you I am
not asking that you leave them I ask only that you say you will wait
untiluntil by and by when

Please Crawford No I cant

Mary YouOh but you must say it Dont tell me you dont love me

She was silent He put his hands upon her shoulders She could feel them
tremble

Dont you love me Mary he repeated Look up Look at me DONT you
love me

She did not look up but she shook her head

No Crawford she said Im afraid not Not enough

She heard him catch his breath and she longedOh how she longedto
throw her arms about him tell him that it was all a lie that she did
love him But she forced herself not to think of her own love only of
those whom she loved and what disgrace and shame and misery would come
upon them if she yielded

Not enough she heard him repeat slowly Youyou dont love me Oh
Mary

She shook her head

I am sorry Crawford she said I cant tell you how sorry
Pleaseplease dont think hardly of me not too hardly I wishI wish
it were different

Neither spoke for a moment Then he said

Im afraid I dont understand Is there someone else

Oh no no There isnt anyone

ThenBut you told meYou have let me think

Please I told you I was not sure of my own feelings II am sure
now I am so sorry you came I should have written you I had begun the
letter

Again silence Then he laughed a short bitter laugh with anything but
mirth in it

I am a fool he said WHAT a fool I have been

Please Crawford dont speak so    Oh where are you going

I I dont know What difference does it make where I go Goodby

Stop Crawford Wait It makes a difference to your father where you
go It makes a difference to me II value your friendship very highly
I hoped I might keep that I hoped you would let me be your friend even
though the other could not be I hoped that

The minute before she had asked him to forget her but she did not
remember that nor did he He was standing by the door looking out For
a moment he stood there Then he turned and held out his hand

Forgive me Mary he said I have behaved like a cad Im afraid
When a fellow has been building air castles and all at once they tumble
down upon his head hewell he is likely to forget other things
Forgive me

She took his hand She could keep back the tears no longer her eyes
filled

There is nothing for me to forgive she said If you will forgive me
that is all I ask Andand let me still be your friend

Of course Bless you Mary II cant talk any more now Youll
with an attempt at a smileyoull have to give me a little time to get
my bearings as your Uncle Shad would say

Andand wont you go back to your father I shall feel so much happier
if you do

He hesitated Then he nodded

If you wish ityes he said I suppose it is the thing I ought to
do Dad will be happy at any rate Oh Mary CANT you

No Crawford no Yes your father will be happy Andand by and by
you will be too I know Are you going

Yes I think I had better I dont feel like meeting anyone and your
Uncle Shad will be here soon I suppose Your man hereIsaiahtold me
of Mr Hamiltons sickness Im sorry

Yes poor Uncle Zoeth He is gaining a little however Crawford I
wont ask you to stay Perhaps it will be best for both of us if you do
not But wont you write me just once more Just to tell me that you and
your father are reconciled I should like to know that And do forgive
meOh do I HAD to say it Crawford

I forgive you Mary Of course you had to say it    But    Well
never mind Yes Ill write of course I hope    No I cant say
that not now Id better go at once I think before I    Goodby

He seized her hand pressed it tightly took his hat from the table and
his bag from the floor and swung out of the door In the doorway she
stood looking after him At the gate he turned waved his hand and
hurried on He did not look back again


When at halfpast six Captain Shadrach having left Annabel and the boy
in charge of the store came home for supper Isaiah had some news to
tell him It was surprising news

You dont say exclaimed the Captain Well well I want to know All
the way from out West eh Sho Where is he now

Isaiah shook his head Thats the funny part of it hes gone he
said

Gone Gone where

I dont know All I know is he come and said he wanted to see
MaryGustaI went up and told her and she come down to see him I
stayed up along of Zoeth until Debby T came back from her shoppin
cruise Then I come downstairs again and his hat and bag was gone There
want nobody here

Where was MaryGusta Where is she now

Up in her room I callate I heard her movin round there a spell
ago

Shadrach went up the stairs along the hall and knocked at Marys door

Who is it asked a faint voice within

Its your Uncle Shad MaryGusta Can I come in

Yes

He entered There was no lamp and the room was dark

Where are you he demanded

Here by the window Uncle Shad

She was sitting in the rocker by the window He could not see her face
but as he bent and kissed her cheek he found it wet

Mercy on us Youve been cryin he declared

OhOh no I havent I

Rubbish Yes you have too Settin alone up here in the dark and
cryin MaryGusta Lathrop come here

She had risen from the rockingchair but he seized her in his arms sat
down in the chair himself and lifted her to his knee just as he used to
do when she was the little MaryGusta

Now there dearie he said Youll tell your Uncle Shad What is it

Oh nothing Uncle Shad dear I wasIm feeling just a little silly
this afternoon I guess You mustnt ask me

Oh Uncle Shad please dont I dont feel as if I could answer Dont
ask me

There there dearie dont you answer nothin You set still here and
be my baby I aint had a chance to baby you for a long spell and it
seems good

Silence Suddenly the Captain felt the head which nestled against his
shoulder stir

Uncle Shadrach said MaryGusta what do you do when you want to
forget

Eh Want to forget Oh I dont know Callate I turn to and sail in
and work a little harder maybe Why

Oh nothing   But I am much obliged for the suggestion Now I am
going to work I shall begin tomorrow morning I wish it was tomorrow

much to spare But aint you BEEN workin for mercy sakes I should say

Another interval of silence Then Mary said

Uncle Shad a good while ago when you asked me aboutabout him I
promised you I would tell when there was anything to tell I am going to
keep my promise He came today and asked measked me to marry himnot
now of course but by and by

Shadrach was not greatly surprised Nevertheless it was a moment before
he spoke Mary felt his arms tighten about her and she realized a little
of the struggle he was making Yet his tone was brave and cheerful

Yes he said Well II kind of callated that would come some day
or other Its all right MaryGusta Zoeth and me have talked it over
and all we want is to see you happy If you said yes to him Zoeth and
Ill say God bless you to both of you

She reached for his hand and lifted it to her lips I know you would
she said All your lives you have been thinking of others and not
of yourselves But I didnt say yes Uncle Shad I am not going to be
married now or by and by I dont want to be I am the silent partner
of Hamilton and Company I am a business woman and I am going to
workREALLY workfrom now on No you mustnt ask me any more
questions Well try to forget it all Kiss me Uncle Shad dear
Thats it Now you go down to supper I shall stay here I am not hungry
tonight




CHAPTER XXVI


Captain Shad did ask more questions of course He asked no more that
eveninghe judged it wisest not to do so but the next day seizing an
opportunity when he and his niece were alone he endeavored to learn a
little more concerning her reasons for dismissing Crawford The Captain
liked young Smith he had believed Mary liked him very much and
although he could not help feeling a guilty sense of relief because the
danger that he and Zoeth might have to share her affections with someone
else was for the time at least out of the way he was puzzled and
troubled by the abruptness of the dismissal There was something he
felt sure which he did not understand

Of course MaryGusta he said I aint askin anythingthat is
I dont mean to put my oar in about what you told me last night
butwell you see Zoeth and me was beginnin to feel that twas pretty
nigh a settled thing between you and that young man

Mary was sitting at the deskshe and her uncle were at the store
togetherand she looked up from the ledger over which she had been
bending and shook her head reproachfully She looked tired and worn so
it seemed to Captain Shadrach as if she had not slept well the night
before or perhaps for several nights

Uncle Shad she said what did I tell you

Eh Why you told meYou know what you told me MaryGusta What do
you ask that for

Because I think you have forgotten the most important part of it I
told you we were going to forget it all And we are We are not going to
speak of it again

But MaryGusta why

No Uncle Shad

But do just tell me this much if you dont I shant rest in peace you
didnt send him away on account of Zoeth and me It want just because
you thought we needed you

No Uncle Shad

Then

Thats all Its over with its done with forever If you really care
about me Uncle Shadand sometimes you know I almost suspect that
you really doyou will never NEVER say another word about it Now come
here and tell me about this account of Heman Rodgers Isnt it time we
tried to get a payment from him

The Captain although still uneasy and far from satisfied asked no more
questions of his niece It was evident that nothing was to be gained in
that way He did however question Isaiah to learn if the latter had
noticed anything unusual in Crawfords manner or if Crawford had said
anything concerning his reason for coming on at that time but Isaiah
had noticed nothing

Umph grunted Shadrach rather impatiently for the mystery in the
affair irritated him Of course you didnt notice YOU wouldnt notice
if your head came off

Mr Chase drew himself up If I hove out such a statement as that he
observed scornfully youd call me a fool If my head come off How
could I notice anything if my head was off You tell me that

His employer grinned I callate you could do it about as well as you
can with it on Isaiah he said and walked away leaving the cook and
steward incoherently anxious to retort but lacking ammunition

So Shadrach was obliged to give up the riddle Lovers quarrels were
by no means unusual he knew that and many young love affairs came to
nothing Mary had never told him that she cared for Crawford But she
had never said she did not care for him And now she would say nothing
except that it was done with forever The Captain shook his head and
longed for Zoeths counsel and advice But Zoeth would not be able to
counsel or advise for months

And now Mary seemed bent upon proving the truth of her statement that
she was henceforth to be solely a business woman The summer being
overand it had been everything considered a successful one for
Hamilton and Companyit became time to buy fall and winter goods also
goods for the holidays Mary went to Boston on a buying expedition When
she returned and informed her uncle what and how much she had bought
he looked almost as if he had been listening to the reading of his death
warrant

Jumpin Judas he exclaimed You dont mean to tell me you bought all
them things andand got TRUSTED for em

Of course I did Uncle Shad It is the only way I could buy them and
so far as that goes everyone was glad to sell me You see our paying
our bills up there in a shorter time than I asked for has made a very
good impression I could have bought ever and ever so much more if I had
thought it best

Jumpin fire Well Im glad you didnt think it best What in the
nation were goin to do with all we have got I dont see

Do with it Why sell it of course

Urnyes I callated that was the idea probably but whos goin to
buy it

Oh lots of people Youll see I am going to advertise this fall
advertise in the papers Oh well make Bakers Bazaar and the rest
worry a little before were through

The Captain was inclined to fear that the most of the worrying would
be done by Hamilton and Company but he expressed no more misgivings
Besides if anyone could sell all those goods that one was his
MaryGusta he was perfectly sure of that He believed her quite
capable of performing almost any miracle Had she not pulled the firm
off the rocks where he and his partner had almost wrecked it Wasnt
she the most wonderful young woman on earth Old as he was Captain Shad
would probably have attempted to thrash any person who expressed a doubt
of that

And the goods were sold all of them and more The advertisements
temptingly worded appeared in the county weeklies and circulars
were sent through the mails Partly by enterprise and partly through
influenceMr Keith helped hereMary attained for Hamilton and Company
the contract for supplying the furniture and draperies for the new hotel
which a New York syndicate was building at Orham Neck It was purely
a commission deal of courseeverything was purchased in Bostonand
Hamilton and Companys profit was a percentage but even a small
percentage on so large a sale made a respectable figure on a check and
helped to pay more of the firms debts And those debts the old ones
were now reduced to an almost negligible quantity

The secondhand horse and wagon still continued to go upon their rounds
but the boy had been replaced by an active young fellow whose name was
Crocker and who was capable of taking orders as well as delivering them
When Captain Shadrach was toldnot consulted concerning but toldthe
wages this young man was to receive he was as he confided to Isaiah
afterward dismasted stove in down by the head and sinkin fast

MaryGusta Lathrop he cried in amazement Are you goin stark
loony Payin that Simmie Crocker fourteen dollars a WEEK for drivin
team and swappin our good sugar and flour for sewincircle lies over
folks back fences I never heard such a thing in my life Why Bakers
Bazaar dont pay the man on their team but ten a week I know that
cause he told me so himself And Bakers Bazaars got more trade than
we have

Yes And that is exactly why we need a better man than they have so
that WE can get more trade Simeon Crocker is an ambitious young chap
He isnt going to be contented with fourteen long

Oh he aint eh Well I aint contented with it now I tell you that
Fourteen dollars a week for drivin cart Jumpin fire Why the cart
itself aint worth moren fifteen and for twentyfive Id heave in the
horse for good measure But Id never get the chance he added unless
I could make the trade in the dark

Mary laughed and patted his shoulder

Never mind Uncle Shad she said confidently Sim Crocker at
fourteen a week is a good investment He will get us a lot of new
business now and next summerwell I have some plans of my own for
next summer

The Christmas business was very good indeed Shadrach Mary Annabel
and Simeon were kept busy Customers came not only from South Harniss
but from West and East Harniss and even from Orham and Bayport The
newspaper advertisements were responsible for this in the beginning but
those who first came told others that the best stock of Christmas goods
in Ostable County was to be found at the store of Hamilton and Company
in South Harniss and so the indirect wordofmouth advertising which
is the best and most convincing kind spread and brought results

Christmas itself was a rather dreary day Zoeth although improving
was not yet strong enough to leave his room and so the Christmas dinner
lacked his presence at the table Mary and Shadrach sat with him for an
hour or so but the doctor and nurse had cautioned them against exciting
him so although the Captain joked continually his jokes were
rather fickle and in his mind was his partners prophecy of two years
beforethat the tide which had up to that time been coming in for
them would soon begin to go out Shadrach could not help feeling that
it had been going out for poor Zoeth at any rate The doctor declared
it was coming in again but how slowly it came And how far would it
come This was the first Christmas dinner he had eaten in years without
seeing Mr Hamiltons kindly patient face at the other side of the
table

And Mary although she tried to appear gay and lighthearted laughing at
her uncles jokes and attempting a few of her own was far from happy
Work Captain Shads recipe for producing forgetfulness had helped but
it had not cured And when as on a holiday like this or at night
after she had gone to bed there was no work to occupy her mind she
remembered only too well Crawford had written her as he promised
after his return home He wrote that he and his father were reconciled
and that he had resumed his studies The letter was brave and cheerful
there was not a hint of whining or complaint in it Mary was proud of
him proud of his courage and selfrestraint She could read between the
lines and the loneliness and hopelessness were there but he had done his
best to conceal them for her sake If he felt resentment toward her he
did not show it Lonely and hopeless as she herself was her heart went
out to him but she did not repent her decision It was better ever and
ever so much better as it was He would forget and be happy by and by
and would never know his fathers shameful story And poor Uncle Zoeth
would never know either As for herwell she must work work harder
than ever Thank God there were six working days in the week

She did not answer that letter After much deliberation she fought down
the temptation and decided not to do so What was the use If one wished
to forget or wished someone else to forget if it was a real wish and
not merely pretending the way to bring about that result was to do
nothing to cause remembrance Letters even the letters of friends the
most platonic letters were reminders She had begged for Crawfords
friendshipshe could not bring herself to let him go without hearing
that he forgave her and would think of her as a friendbut now she
vowed she would not be so silly and childish as to torture him or
herself unnecessarily She would not do it And so she did not write


After Christmas came the long dull winter It was the most discouraging
season the silent partner of Hamilton and Company had yet put in in
her capacity as manager There were no cottagers to help out with their
custom very few new customers no fresh faces in the store the same
dreary deadly round from morning till night She tried her hardest
and with the able assistance of Sim Crocker who was proving himself a
treasure did succeed in making Februarys sales larger than Januarys
and those of March larger than either But she looked forward to April
and the real spring with impatience She had a plan for the spring

It was in March that she experienced a great satisfaction and gave
Shadrach the surprise and delight of his life by collecting the firms
bill against Mr Jeremiah Clifford Mr Clifford it will be remembered
had owed Hamilton and Company one hundred and ten dollars for a long
time There was every indication that he was perfectly satisfied with
the arrangement and intended to owe it forever Mary had written had
called upon him repeatedly had even journeyed to Ostable and consulted
her friend Judge Baxter The Judge had promised to look into the matter
and he did so but his letter to her contained little that was hopeful


There is money there wrote the Judge The man Clifford appears to
be in very comfortable circumstances but he is a shrewd there were
indications here that the word rascal had been written and then
erased person and so far as I can learn there is not a single item of
property real or otherwise that is in his own name If there were
we might attach that property for your debt but we cannot attach Mrs
Cliffords holdings All I can advise is to discontinue selling him more
goods and to worry him all you can about the old bill He may grow tired
of being dunned and pay if not all at least something on account


When Mary read this portion of the letter to her Uncle Shadrach his
scorn was outspoken

Get tired he scoffed Jerry Clifford get tired of bein dunned
DONT talk so foolish Why he gets fat on that kind of thing its
the main excitement he has that and spendin a cent twice a day for
newspapers Did you ever watch Jerry buy a paper No Well you go up to
Elliss some day when the mornin papers are put out for sale and watch
him Hell drive up to the door with that old hoopskirt of a horse
of histhats what the critter looks like one of them oldfashioned
hoopskirts there was nothin to them but framework and a hollow
inside and thats all there is to that horseWell Jerry hell drive
up and come in to the paper counter his eyes shinin and his nerves all
keyed up and one hand shoved down into his britches pocket Hell stand
and look over the papers on the counter readin as much of every one
as he can for nothin and then by and by that handll come out of his
pocket with a cent in it Then the other handll reach over and get hold
of the paper hes callatin to buy get a good clove hitch onto it and
then for a minute hell stand there lookin first at the cent and then
at the paper and rubbin the money between his finger and thumbhes
figgerin to have a little of the copper smell left on his hand even if
he has to let go of the coin you seeand

Mary laughed

Uncle Shad she exclaimed what ridiculous nonsense you do talk

No nonsense about it Its dead serious It aint any joke to Jerry
you can bet on that Well after a spell he kind of gets his spunk up
to make the plunge as you might say lays down the pennyOh he
never throws it down he wouldnt treat real money as disrespectful
as thatgrabs up the paper and makes a break for outdoors never once
lookin back for fear he might change his mind When he drives off in
his buggy you can see that hes all het up and trembly like one of them
reckless Wall Street speculators you read about Hes spent a cent
but hes had a lovely nervewrackin time doin it Oh a feller has
to satisfy his cravin for excitement somehow and Jerry satisfies his
buyin onecent newspapers and seein his creditors get mad Do you
suppose you can worry such a critter as that by talkin to him about
what he owes Might as well try to worry a codfish by leanin over the
rail of the boat and hollerin to it that its drownin

Mary laughed again Im afraid you may be right Uncle Shad she said
but I shant give up hope My chance may come some day if I wait and
watch for it

It came unexpectedly and in a rather odd manner One raw windy March
afternoon she was very much surprised to see Sam Keith walk into the
store Sam since his graduation from college was as he expressed it
moaning on the bar in Bostonthat is to say he was attending the
Harvard Law School with the hope on his parents part that he might
ultimately become a lawyer

Why Sam exclaimed Mary Is this you

Sam grinned cheerfully Tis I he declared I am here That is
to say the handsome youth whose footfalls you hear approaching upon
horseback is none other than our hero Mary you are as usual a sight
to be thankful for How do you do

Mary admitted that she was in good health and then demanded to know what
he was doing down on the Cape at that time of the year He sat down in
a chair by the stove and propped his feet against the hearth before
replying

Why Havent you guessed he asked in mock amazement Dear me Im
surprised I should have thought the weather would have suggested my
errand Hear that zephyr doesnt it suggest bathing suits and outing
flannels and mosquitoes and hammock flirtations Eh

The zephyr was a sixtymileanhour March gale Sam replied to his own
question

Answer he said it does not Right my child go up head But
honest Injun I am down here on summer business That Mr Raymond Dads
friend who was visiting us this summer is crazy about the Cape He
has decided to build a summer home here at South Harniss and the first
requisite being land to build it on he has asked Dad to buy the strip
between our own property and the North Inlet always provided it can be
bought Dad asked me to come down here and see about it so here I am

Mary considered Oh yes she said after a moment I know the land
you mean Who owns it

Thats what I didnt know said Sam But I do know now I asked the
first person I met after I got off the train and oddly enough he turned
out to be the owner himself It was old CliffordIsaiah Elisha
HoseaJeremiah thats it I knew it was one of the prophets

So Mr Clifford owns that land I didnt know that

Neither did I He didnt tell me at first that he did own it Asked me
what I wanted to know for

Did you tell him asked Mary

For the first time since Mr Keiths arrival that young gentlemans easy
assurance seemed a little shaken He appeared to feel rather foolish

Why yes to be honest I did he admitted I was an idiot I
suppose but everyone asks about everyones else business down here and
I didnt think He kept talking and pumping and before I realized it I
told him about Raymonds being so anxious to get that property being
dead set on it and all that and about my being commissioned to buy
at any reasonable figure And then after a while he astonished me by
saying he owned the land himself Confound it I suppose hell jam the
price away up after what I told him

Oh then you havent bought

Not yet I was willing but for some reason he wouldnt sell at
oncewouldnt even talk price Wanted to think it over he said I
cant wait now but I am coming down again on Monday and we shall close
the deal then

That evening Mary told Shadrach what Sam had said The Captain looked
puzzled

I didnt know Jerry Clifford owned that land he said I dont
believe he does

Of course he does Uncle Shad He wouldnt have told Sam he did own it
if he didnt What in the world would he gain by that

Why nothin I presume likely But he must have bought it mighty
recent Last I heard Jimmie G owned that piece Twas part of the
property his father left him Next time I see Jimmie Ill ask him

So three days later when Jimmie Ghis last name was Peterspassed
the store the Captain hailed him and inviting him in went straight to
the point

When did you sell Jerry Clifford that North Inlet land of yours Jim
he asked

Jimmie G looked surprised How in time did you know I had sold it he
demanded It beats all how things get around in this town I never sold
that land until day afore yesterday evenin and the deed didnt pass
till yesterday and yet you know the whole business Not that I care
twas Jerry wanted it kept still Who told you

Captain Shad whistled I see he said slowly I see Yes yes When
Jerry told Sam he owned that land he    Humph Its just another case
of the boy lied thats all Tut tut tut When you get ahead of Jerry
Clifford youve got to turn out early aint you I hope you got a good
price for the land Jim

Well I didnt that is not very big Whats up anyway What are you
hintin at Capn Shad

Before the Captain could answer Mary who had been listening to the
conversation broke in to ask a question

Mr Peters she cried eagerly would you mind telling me this Whose
name is the new deed in Mr Cliffords or his wifes

Jimmie G laughed Why that was kind of funny too he said You
know Jerry Capn Shad he never has nothin in his own nameits all
in his wifes Thats a principle of his

Id call it a lack of principle grunted Shadrach Never mind Jim
go on

But he was in a terrible rush to close the sale for some reason or
other went on Peters and I forgot myself and had the deed made in
the name of Jeremiah Clifford He made a big row at first but it seemed
as if he couldnt wait for me to have it changed so he handed over his
check and

Wait Wait please Mr Peters broke in Mary her eyes flashing with
excitement Just tell me if I understand you correctly You sold that
land to Mr Clifford and he owns it now IN HIS OWN NAME

Why yessartin

Mary waited to hear no more She ran out of the store and to the
postoffice A few minutes later she was talking with Judge Baxter over
the telephone When she returned the Captain was curious to know where
she had been but she would not tell him

Wait she said Wait Uncle Shad I think something is going to
happen

It happened on Monday morning Mary was at the desk Simeon was in the
back room getting ready his early morning orders and Captain Shad was
standing by the window looking out Suddenly Mary heard him utter an
exclamation

What is the matter she asked

Oh nothin

You spoke as if you were in pain

No wonder Im lookin at somethin that gives me a pain That
wizenedup landshark of a Jerry Clifford is in sight bound to the
postoffice I callate Goin to put a onecent stamp on a letter and
let the feller that gets it pay the other cent I suppose He always
asks the postmaster to lick the stamp sos to save the wear and tear on
his own tongue Thats a fact    No he added a moment later he
aint goin to the office hes turnin down the lane here    Eh
Jumpin fire of brimstone I do believeWHAT in the world

For Mr Cliffords step was upon the platform of the store and in
another moment the door opened and the tightfisted one himself
appeared Shadrach said nothing he could only stare in amazement It
had been more than two years since Jeremiah had crossed that threshold

But he crossed it now And after a look about the place ignoring the
Captain completely he walked over to the desk He did not look happy
Mary on the contrary looked very much pleased

Good morning Mr Clifford she said

Jeremiah who was a little thin man looked up at her from under his
heavy gray eyebrows and above his spectacles He did not acknowledge the
salutation

Umph he grunted savagely You think youre smart dont ye

Shadrach started forward

Why you he began Mary held up her hand

Dont interfere Uncle Shad she ordered This is Mr Cliffords
affair and mine We understand each other perfectly Then turning to
the frowning Jeremiah she said Why yes thank you Mr Clifford I
do think I am rather cleverjust now Dont you think I am yourself

Again the visitor ignored the question

What did you go and stick an attachment on that land of mine for he
demanded

Surely you dont need to ask me that Mr Clifford The amount is
one hundred and ten dollars and sixtythree cents I remember it and I
should imagine you must certainly it has been called to your attention
often enough

Umph Well you can keep your darned old attachment

Very well and you can keep your landwhat is left I mean I think
you will keep it for some timeafter I tell Mr Keith the facts He
will be here this afternoon you know

It was evident that Jeremiah was quite aware of the time of Sam Keiths
arrival His teeththe few remainingsnapped together and as Captain
Shadrach said afterwards he looked as if undecided whether to bite
or put back his head and howl Apparently he decided that howling was
safer

I was callatin to pay that bill of yours anyhow he said

Of course and we were calculating that you would said Mary sweetly
Your calculations and ours are proving true Mr Clifford Thats nice
isnt it

From the direction of the back room where Simeon was busy with his
orders came the sound of a smothered laugh Shadrach upon whom
understanding of the situation was just beginning to dawn slapped his
knee Mr Clifford looked positively venomous

If I pay that billthatwhat was itthat hundred and ten dollars
you say I owe youdo I get that attachment off my land right away he
demanded

If you pay the one hundred and ten dollarsand the sixtythree
centsI shall phone Judge Baxter the next minute said Mary promptly

Jeremiah hesitated no longer He had considered the situation in all its
phases before leaving home and the one hundred and ten dollars was but
a small item compared to his expected profit on the sale of the North
Inlet land He reached into his pocket produced a long dingy leather
pocketbook wound about with twine unwound the twine opened the
pocketbook and produced a blank check

Give me a pen and ink he snarled and Ill fill this in

The Captain reached for the pen and ink bottle but Mary interfered

Cash if you please she said sweetly

Jeremiah looked at her steadily for what seemed a long time Then she
was surprised to see the corner of his lip twitch and notice a grim
twinkle in his eye Also there was a grudging note of admiration in his
voice when he next spoke

Aint takin no chances be you he said dryly

No Dont you think weve taken enough already

Mr Clifford did not answer He replaced the blank check in his
pocketbook and from another compartment extracted some bills rolled in
a tight little cylinder and wound about with elastic

There you be he said shortly Then turning to Shadrach he added
Dont I get nothin off for payin cash

From the back room came a vigorous Haw haw Even Mary laughed aloud
As for Captain Shad he could only stare struck speechless by his
visitors audacity Mary when she had finished laughing answered for
him

We shall deduct the interest we might have charged you Mr Clifford
she said Thank you There is your change and there is the receipted
bill Now I shall call up Judge Baxter

When she returned from the postoffice Jeremiah was still there
Shadrach all smiles was doing up parcels

What are those Uncle Shad asked Mary Mr Clifford answered

Oh I thought I might as well buy a little sugar and flour and such
he said Always come in handy they do Send em up when you get to it
Goodby

His hand was on the door but Mary called to him

Mr Clifford she called just a minute please Are you in any hurry
for these thingsthe sugar and the rest of it

No dont knows I be special why

Oh nothing except that if you were in a hurry I should advise your
paying for them I told you you remember that we werent taking
chances

For an instant Jeremiah stood there glowering Then he did another
astonishing thing He took out the pocketbook once more and from it
extracted a twodollar bill

Take it out of that he said and send me a receipted bill
afterwards I always callate to know what Ive paid for And say
youwhats your nameMaryGusta if you get tired of workin for Shad
Gould and Zoeth Hamilton come round and see me Ive gotI mean my
wifes gottwo or three mortgages thats behind on the interest I
aint been able to collect it for her yet butbut by time I believe
YOU could

He went out and the next moment Mary was almost smothered in her uncles
embrace

After thisafter THIS roared Shadrach Ill believe anythings
possible if youve got a hand in it MaryGusta If YOUD been Jonah
youd have put the whale in your pocket and swum ashore




CHAPTER XXVII


Early in April when Mary announced that she was ready to put into
operation her biggest and most ambitious plan suggested the year before
by Barbara Howethe tearoom and giftshop planthe Captain did not
offer strenuous opposition

I cant see much sense in it he admitted I dont knows I know what
its all about Nigh as I can make out youre figgerin to open up some
kind of a hightoned eatin house Is that it

Why no Uncle Shad not exactly explained Mary

Then what is ita drinkin house I presume likely thats it bein
as you call it a tearoom Kind of a temperance saloon eh Cant a
feller get coffee in it if he wants to I dont wake up nights much
hankerin for tea myself

Listen Uncle Shad A tearoomat least a tearoom of the sort I
intend to haveis a place where the summer people the women and girls
especially will come and sit at little tables and drink tea and
eat cakes and ice cream and look off at the ocean if the weather is
pleasant

Yes and at the fog if taint and talk about their neighbors
clothes and run down the characters of their best friends Yes yes I
see sort of a sewin circle without the sewin All right heave ahead
and get your tearoom off the ways if you want to If anybody can make
the thing keep afloat you can MaryGusta

So Mary thus encouraged went on to put her scheme into effect She
had been planning the details for some time About halfway down the lane
leading to the house from the store was another small storyandahalf
dwelling of the oldfashioned Cape Cod type It stood upon a little hill
and commanded a wide view of ocean and beach and village There were
some weatherbeaten trees and a tangle of shrubs about it It had been
untenanted for a good while and was in rather bad repair

Mary arranged with the owner a Bayport man to lease this house and
land at a small rental for three years In the lease was included
consent to the making of necessary alterations and repairs and the
privilege of purchasing at a price therein named at the end of the
three years should the tenant wish to do so

Then with the aid of soap and water white paint and whitewash
attractive but inexpensive wall papers and odds and ends of quaint old
furniture of which the parlor and best bedroom of the GouldHamilton
home supplied the larger quantity she proceeded to make over the
interior of the little building To every bit of nautical bricabrac
pictures of old sailing ships and sea curios she gave especial
prominence Then the lawn was mowed the tangled shrubbery untangled
and clipped and pruned cheap but pretty lattices made to look like the
shrouds of a ship over which climbing roses were supposedsome dayto
twine were placed against the walls and rustic tables set about under
the trees and the grape arbor with ship lanterns hung above them The
driveway down to the lane was rolled and hardened and a sign painted
by Joshua Bemis the local House Boat and Sign Painter Tinsmith and
Glaziersee Mr Bemiss advertisement in the Advocatewas hung on a
frame by the gateway

Captain Shads remarks when he first saw that sign may be worth quoting
Mary had not consulted him concerning it she deemed it best not to do
so When it was in place however she led him out to inspect Shadrach
adjusted his spectacles and read as follows

 THE FORARD LOOKOUT
 TEA AND GIFTS
 DAINTY THINGS TO EAT
 PRETTY THINGS TO BUY
 ALLS WELL

There was the picture of a fullrigged ship with every stitch set alow
and aloft sailing through a sea of thick green and white paint toward a
kind of green wall with green feather dusters growing out of it

Shadrach subjected this work of art to a long and searching stare At
last he spoke

Carryin every rag she can hist he observed nobody at the wheel
land dead ahead and breakers under the bows Looks to me as if twas
liable to be a short vyage and a lively one But the forard lookout
says alls well and he ought to know hes had more experience aboard
giftshop ships I presume likely than I have Whats those bristly
things stickin up along shore thereeel grass or tea grounds

For the first few weeks after the tearoom was really off the ways the
optimistic declaration of the Forard Lookout seemed scarcely warranted
by the facts Mary was inclined to think that all was by no means well
In fitting out the new venture she had been as economical as she
dared but she had been obliged to spend money and to take on a fresh
assortment of debts Then too she had engaged the services of a good
cook and two waitresses so there was a weekly expense bill to consider
And the number of motor cars which turned in at the new driveway was
disappointingly small

But the number grew larger As people had talked about Hamilton and
Companys assortment of Christmas goods so now they began to talk about
the quaintness and delightful originality of the Forard Lookout The
tea was good the cakes and ices were good on pleasant days the
view was remarkably fine and the pretty things in the gift shop were
temptingly displayed So as May passed and June came and the cottages
and hotels began to open the business of the new tearoom and gift shop
grew from fair to good and from that to very good indeed

Mary divided her time between the store and the tearoom doing her best
to keep a supervising eye on each She was in no mood to meet people and
kept out of the way of strangers as much as possible even of her former
acquaintances who came to the Forard Lookout she saw but few If she
had not been too busy she might have found it amusing the contrasting
studies in human nature afforded by these former acquaintances in their
attitude toward her

For instance Mr and Mrs Christopher Mullet and daughter Irene the
latter now through school and finished until her veneering actually
glittered sat drinking tea at a table on the lawn Said Mrs Mullet

And THIS is what its come to after all the airs and frills and the
goin to Europe and I dont know what all Here she is keepin an eatin
house An eatin housejust THINK of it If that aint a comedown
Wouldnt you think shed be ashamed Rena

Miss Mullet drooped a weary eyelid and sighed a hopeless sigh

Oh Mother she drawled in deep disgust CANT you stop calling
me by that outlandish name I was christened Irene I believe PLEASE
remember it

All right Reall right Irene I wont forget again Oh theres
MaryGusta now Showin herself out here with all these city folks
when shes nothin but a hired helpa table girl as you might say
I shant notice her anyway I may buy her tea and stuff but IWhos
that runnin up to her andand kissin herandmercy on us Youd
think they was sisters if you didnt know Who is it Looks kind of
common she does to me Dont you think so RenaIrene I mean

Irene sniffed

That she said with cutting emphasis is Barbara Howe Her people
are building that big summer house at Osterville and her father is a
millionaire so they say And her people wouldnt let her come to the
school you sent me to because they thought it wasnt good enough for
her Thats how common SHE is I met her once but she doesnt know
me now although she is perfectly crazy over that Mary Lathrop IOh
theres Father drinking out of his saucer again For heavens sake
lets go home

And just then Barbara was enthusiastically hugging her former schoolmate
and exclaiming

You did it I knew you would if you would only try I said it required
a knack or a genius or something and that I was certain you had it
Its the dearest place of the kind Ive ever seen my dear and if every
single person I know who is in this vicinity doesnt come here at least
once a week and spend lots and lots of money Ill never speak to them
again Im going to turn myself into a walking phonograph my dear
with just one record If you love me visit the Forard Lookout And of
course everyone loves mehow can they help it Sowell just wait and
see what happens

So far as spreading abroad the praises of the new tearoom was
concerned she was as good as her word In August the patronage was so
great and continuous that Mary found it necessary to hire three more
waitresses and a salesgirl for the gift shop She spent more of her own
time there leaving the care of the store to Shadrach Simeon Crocker
and a new clerk who had been hired to help with the summer custom When
early September brought the beginning of the seasons end the books
of both the Lookout and of Hamilton and Company showed a substantial
profit

While all this was going on Zoeth was steadily gaining in health and
strength In July he was sitting in the sunshine upon the front porch
In August he was able to climb to the buggy seat and be driven up to the
store where day after day he sat in his armchair behind the
counter watching what was going on listening to his partners happy
chatterfor Shadrach was in high spirits nowand occasionally saying a
word or two himself On pleasant Sundays he was driven to church and the
Captain and Mary accompanied him He was white and frail and thin
but the doctor assured them that so far as he could see there was no
reason to expect anything but a complete recovery

It did seem to Captain Shad however that his partner had something
on his mind He seemed often to be thinking deeply and at times to be
troubled and disturbed The Captain had never asked never attempted by
questioning to learn what the cause of the troubleprovided there was
anymight be He had been told often enough that the patient must not
be excited so he meant to take no risks but Zoeths long silences
and the expression on his face as he sat there in the chair evidently
thinking deeply puzzled and worried his friend and partner He noticed
the same expression at times when Mary was in the room Zoeths eyes
would follow her as she moved about and in them was the look the Captain
could not understand

Shadrach had told his friend of Marys sending young Smith away Zoeth
had asked concerning Crawford almost as soon as he was permitted to take
part in a lengthy conversation He appeared greatly interested even
eager

But Shadrach he said are you sure she sent him away because she
didnt care for him Are you sure that was the reason

What other reason could there be demanded the Captain She as much
as told me that was it herself I was some surprised of course for
Id rather callated twas as good as settled between em but it turned
out that I didnt know what I was talkin about That HAS happened afore
in my life strange as it may seem he added dryly

Zoeth sighed I wish he said slowly I wish I knew

What do you wish you knew

Eh Oh nothin Ifif I was only a little mite stronger Id try to
talk with MaryGusta myself Id likeId like to have her tell me
about it

Meanin you dont believe me eh There there shipmate its all
right I was only jokin But I wouldnt ask MaryGusta about that if
I was you Course I know she cares as much or more for her Uncle Zoeth
than for anybody on earth and shed tell him anything if he asked
her but I dont believeWell I wouldnt ask if I was you You
understand

Yes yes Shadrach I think I understand You mean she felt bad to have
to saywhat she did sayto that young man and she wouldnt want to be
reminded of it

Thats about it Zoeth

Silence for some minutes Both partners were occupied with their
thoughts Then Zoeth said

Shadrach II

He did not finish the sentence The Captain ventured to remind him

Yes Zoeth what is it he asked

Nothin II cant tell you now By and by if the good Lord gives me
strength again IllNever mind now Dont ask me please

So Shadrach did not ask but he was puzzled and a little anxious What
was it his partner had to tell and found the telling so difficult




CHAPTER XXVIII


It was not until a day in midSeptember that Captain Shadrach learned
his partners secret He and Zoeth and Mary were at the store together
Business was still good but the rush was over The summer cottages
were closing and most of the Cape hotels had already closed The Forard
Lookout had taken down its sign at the end of the previous week Its
voyage for that year was over It had been a prosperous one

Mary was sorry that the busy season was at an end She was very very
tired she had allowed herself no rest had taken no holidays had done
her best to think of nothing except matters connected with Hamilton and
Company or the tearoom These fortunately had given her enough to
think of other thoughts she resolutely crowded from her mind Now there
would be no tearoom to plan for and thanks to Sim Crocker and the
competent way in which he had assumed care of the store she no longer
felt the absolute necessity of remaining there from daylight until late
in the evening Her Uncle Zoeth was almost well also she would no
longer have his health as an additional burden upon her mind She was in
danger of being forced to think of herself and that she knew she must
not do Thinking of herself would surely mean thinking of someone else
and of what might have been And what useless hopeless thinking that
would be No no She must find something else to keep her thoughts
occupied

So she was planning the making over and enlarging of the store front
putting in larger and better windows and strengthening the platform She
was discussing the plan with Shadrach and Zoeth when John Keith entered
The Keiths were leaving South Harniss rather early that year and the
head of the family had dropped in to say goodby Mr Keiths liking for
Mary was as strong as ever and for her uncles he had by this time a
very real regard a feeling which was reciprocated by them

Conversation began in the way the majority of conversations begin with
a discussion of the weather its recent past present and probable
future shifted to the tearoom and its success and then to the
visitors recent trip to New York from which city he had just returned
It was near the noon hour and there were few customers to interrupt
Those who did come were taken care of by Mr Crocker

Anything new happenin over there inquired Captain Shadrach asking
news of the metropolis exactly as he would have asked concerning the
gossip of Harniss Center Meet anybody you knew did you

Keith smiled Why yes he said I met the people I went to see Mine
was a business trip I didnt meet anyone unexpectedly if thats what
you mean

The Captain nodded Didnt get down on South Street did you he
asked No I thought not If you had youd have met plenty When I was
goin to sea I bet I never went cruisin down South Street in my life
that I didnt run afoul of somebody I want expectin to Greatest place
for meetin folks in the world I callate South Street is Lots of
seafarin men have told me so

Keiths smile broadened as he was handed this nugget of wisdom Then he
said

You remind me Captain that I did meet someone after all In Boston
not in New York and I met him only yesterday It was someone you know
too and Mary here used to know him quite well I thinkyoung Crawford
Smith Sams Harvard friend He visited us here in South Harniss one
summer

Shadrach was the only one of the trio of listeners who made any comment
at all on this speech Even he did not speak for a moment glancing
apprehensively at Mary before doing so Mary said nothing and Zoeth
leaning back in his chair his face hidden from his partners gaze by
the end of the counter did not speak

Sho exclaimed the Captain Sho So you met him did you In Boston
Thats funny I had an idea he was out West somewheres

So did I The last I heard concerning him he had given up his studies
in the East herehe was studying medicine as perhaps you knowand had
gone back to his home in Nevada His father who was not at all well
asked him to do so He had written Sam once or twice from out there
So I was surprised enough to see him in Boston I met him in the South
Station and we chatted for a few moments He told me that his father was
dead

From behind the end of the counter where Zoeth sat came an odd sound a
sort of gasp Shadrach leaned forward quickly

Whats the matter Zoeth he asked Before Zoeth could answer Mary
spoke

Dead she repeated Mr Keith Ididdid you say Crawford Smiths
father was DEAD

Her tone was so strange that even Mr Keith could not help noticing it
He looked at her seemed about to ask a question and then answered hers
instead

Why yes he said he is dead He had been in poor health for some
time so his son told me and about two weeks ago he died Crawford did
not tell me any particulars nor did he say what had brought him East
In fact he didnt seem anxious to talk acted as if he had something
on his mind Of course I said I was sorry and he thanked me and inquired
regarding Mrs Keith and Edna and Sam Then I had to hurry for my train
   Oh are you going Mary Well then I must say goodby until next
summer we leave tomorrow morning

Mary explained rather hurriedly that she must speak with Simeon for
a few minutes said goodby shook hands and hastened out Keith looked
after her

I hope I havent made a blunder he said in speaking of young
Smith She and he were quiteerfriendly at one time werent they
I understood so from some remarks of Sams Didnt put my foot in it by
mentioning the boys name did I I certainly hope not

Zoeth did not speak Shadrach hastened to reassure him

No no he said There was one time when even me and Zoeth figgered
there might beerwell we didnt know but what he and she was liable
to be moren just friends But its all off now seems so They dont
even write each other I guess I callate maybe MaryGusta got tired
of him he explained He was a real nice young feller but he probably
want quite good enough for her Furs that goes he added with the
emphasis of absolute conviction I never laid eyes on one that was

Keith looked relieved Well Im glad if I didnt make a mistake he
said She seemed so startled when I said that the man was dead and her
manner was so odd Didnt you notice it yourself Captain

Shadrach nodded

I noticed she seemed sort of sot all aback he said but I dont
knows thats so strange when you consider that she and Crawford used to
be such friends Moren probable shes heard him talk a good deal about
his father

Well perhaps so No doubt that is it Im afraid she is working too
hard and worrying too much over her various enterprises here She is
succeeding wonderfully of course but I dont like to see her losing
those roses in her cheeks Theyre much too precious to lose Keep your
eye on her Captain and dont let her wear herself out

He soon said goodby Captain Shadrach accompanied him to the door
Zoeth remained where he was not rising even when he shook hands with
his departing friend But when the Captain turned back he saw his
partner standing by the end of the counter and clutching it with one
hand while he beckoned with the other Shadrach gave him one look and
then crossed the space between them in two strides

For the land sakes Zoeth he begged whats the matter

Zoeth waved him to silence Sshh sshh he pleaded in a whisper
Dont holler so shell hear you Shadrach II

What IS it broke in his friend Whats the matter Zoeth Shall I
fetch the doctor

No no ImIm all right Shadrach Ive just hadhad a kind of
shocka surprise thats all I aint very strong yet and itit kind
of upset me But Shadrach I want to talk to you I want to tell you
somethin right away I cant keep it to myself any longer Cant we go
hometo my room or somewhereswhere we can talk Please Shadrach

There there shipmate take it easy Go home Course we can Hey
Sim shouting to Mr Crocker who was in the back room You and Mary
can take care of the store cant you Zoeth and me are goin home for
dinner

Simeon replied that Mary was not there she had gone out the back way
down to the house he thought But you go ahead Capn Shad he added
I can take care of the store all right

At home and in Mr Hamiltons room the Captain pulled forward the most
comfortable chair forced his partner to sit in it closed and locked
the door sat down on the edge of the bed and said

There Now were all taut and shipshape and nobody can get aboard to
interrupt Fire away Zoeth What is it youve got to tell

Zoeth his hand trembling reached into the inside pocket of his coat
took out an oldfashioned wallet and from it produced a muchcrumpled
envelope

Shadrach he said I dont hardly know how to begin It seems so
strange to think that you and me whove been so close to each other
all these years should have a secret between us if only for a little
while It seems wicked I guess tis wicked and Im the wicked one for
keepin it from you

The Captain laughed

You couldnt be wicked if you was apprenticed to the Old Harry for ten
years Zoeth he said You dont know how to be and the devil himself
couldnt teach you Now dont waste time tellin me Im speaking
lightly of sacred things he added For one thing the Old Scratch
aint sacred as I know of and for another I want to hear that secret
What is it

Zoeth shook his head I am wicked all the same he said but I guess
Ive been punished There want any real reason why I shouldnt have
told you afore but somehow I couldnt make up my mind to speak of it I
just couldnt But Im goin to tell you now Shadrach

He held up the crumpled envelope

You remember when I was took sick he said You remember I was struck
down all of a heap in the kitchen Yes well did you ever wonder what
it was struck me down Ill tell you Twas a letter that came to me in
the mail that morning This was the letter I managed to put it in my
inside vest pocket that time when Isaiah run off after you and left me
lyin there I didnt want him to see it I didnt want anybody tonot
then Now I want you to read it Shadrach But before you do let me
warn you You should ask the Almighty to give you strength Youre goin
to be surprised Shadrach surprised and shocked Here it is read it

He handed the envelope to his partner The latter took it wonderingly
and looked at the inscription

Nobodys handwritin that I know he said

You knew it once well enough

I did And it was mailed out in Carson City Nevada Why thats where
the Crawford Smith boy lives aint it What on earth

He opened the envelope and from it took several sheets closely covered
with finely written lines He began to read and as he read his
expression changed from curiosity to wonder to amazement to anger to
a mixture of the last three The final sheet fell from his fingers to
the floor He looked up with a very white face

My God he said solemnly


A halfhour later they were still talking Shadrach had not entirely
recovered from the surprise but now he could think and speak more
coherently although the wonder of it all was overpowering

It seems as if the hand of the Lord was in it he declared

It is agreed Zoeth with absolute conviction See how it worked out
accordin to His promise The wicked flourished for a time but God sent
the punishment in due season didnt He Cant you see the poor fellers
agonizin in every line of that letter

POOR feller Good Lord above Zoeth Hamilton you aint pityin HIM
are you You aint sorry for himYOU

Zoeth nodded I want at first he said At first the whole thing
comin on me out of a clear sky as you might say knocked me flat The
doctor when he came said he thought I must have had a sudden shock I
did that was it that letter But later on when I was gettin better
and could think again and when I was alone and had the chance and could
read the letter again I began totowell not forgive him for what he
doneI dont suppose I can ever do that

I should say not Damn him

Hush Shadrach hes dead

So he is I forgot Then hes damned I guess without any orders from
me

He was damned here on earth Shadrach All his lifethe last part of
it anyhowmust have been a torment He must have idolized that boy
of his He says so in the letter but its plain on every line of the
writin without his sayin it And cant you just imagine him as the boy
grew up and they loved each other more and more tremblin and scared
every minute for fear that somehow or other his sonll learn that the
father he loves and respects is aa thiefandand worse Seems to me
I can imagine it And then all at once the boy comes to him and says he
wants to marryOh my soul Shadrach think of ithe wants to marry
your girl and mineMarcelluss stepdaughter Why it must have driven
him nigh crazy And then they quarrel and the boy the only bein on
earth hes livin for goes off and leaves him And he knows hes
comin hereto usand that some time or other hes sartin to learn
everything No wonder he wrote that letter No wonder

The Captain interrupted

Writin you of all people he said Writin you and beggin you not
to let MaryGusta marry his son and for what To save the boy from
somethin bad No For all he knew MaryGusta might be what she
is the best and finest girl on earth What he was beggin for was
himselfthat his son shouldnt know what HE was thats all No Zoeth
I cant pity him much Hes dead and thats a good thing too The
wonder of it is that hes been alive all this time and we didnt know
And to thinkbut there its all wonderful

Both were silent for a moment Then Zoeth said

The one thing thats troubled me most in all this Shadrach is about
MaryGusta herself How does she really feel towards Crawford She
sent him away you told me that but are you sure she did it because she
didnt care enough for him to marry him Are you sure there want any
other reason

She gave me to understand there want What other reason could there
be

Wellwell Shadrach it all depends seems to me You know
MaryGusta the last person she thinks about on earth is herself If
she did think a sight of Crawford if she thought ENOUGH of him
she wouldnt let him suffer on account of her would she She knew
probably that he loved and respected his father and a fathers good
name must mean a lot to a son Then there is usyou and me Shadrach
She wouldnt let us suffer if she could help it Do you see what I
mean

Humph mused the Captain thinking aloud I callate I do Zoeth You
mean if MaryGusta had found out the facts about Ed Farmer who he was
and what he done and if she knew Crawford Smiths dad WAS Ed Farmer and
that Crawford didnt know it and we didnt know ityou mean that BEIN
MaryGusta rather than bring sorrow and trouble on Crawford and on us
shed sacrifice her own feelins andand would pretend she didnt care
for him so as to get him to go away and save him and us Thats what you
mean I presume likely

Thats it Shadrach

Umyes Well theres just one thing that makes that notion seem
considerble more than unlikely How in the world could she have found
out that there ever was an Edgar Farmer

Good many folks in South Harniss could have told her that if theyd had
a mind to

Maybe so but they couldnt have told her that Edwin Smith of Carson
City Nevada was ever Edgar Farmer No sir they couldnt Nobody knew
itbut Ed Farmer himself How could our MaryGusta know it

I dont know Shadrach unlessshes awful smart you knowsomethin
might have put her on the track and she puzzled it out I know that
aint likely but Shadrach if she does care for Crawford and he cares
for her II want em to have each other I do They must

Shadrach stared at him

Zoeth Hamilton he exclaimed do you know what youre sayin You
want our girl to marry the son of the man thatthat

I know what he did Shadrach you dont need to tell me But hes dead
and his boy is a good boyyou liked him and so did I And Shadrach
Ive been thinkin an awful lot about this since I got the letter and
have been well enough to think And Ive made up my mind to just this
There has been sorrow and trouble enough brought on already by that
wickedness There shant be any more What wrecked all our lives
thirtyfive years ago shant wreck these two if I can help it If
MaryGusta cares for him and he for her they must have each other and
be happy And you and I will be happy watchin their happiness

He paused and then added

So I wish Shadrach there was some way of findin out for sure that
she sent him away because she didnt care for him and not for any other
reason

Shadrach rose from his chair and laid his hand on his friends shoulder
He cleared his throat once or twice before speaking and there was still
a shake in his voice as he said

Zoeth youre a better man than I ever hope to be I declare you make
me ashamed of myself

Neither of them ate much dinner although Isaiah had prepared a
cranberry pie made from the first fruit of the fall season and
was correspondingly disappointed when both of his employers left it
untouched

Aint a mite of use my slavin myself to death cookin fancy vittles
for this crew he grumbled I stood over that cookstove this mornin
until I got so everlastin hot that every time the cold air blowed onto
me I steamed And yet I cant satisfy

Oh yes you can observed Captain Shad rising from the table You
satisfied us too quick that was the trouble We was satisfied afore we
got to the pie

Umph I want to know Well MaryGusta was satisfied afore that She
didnt eat hardly anything Said she want hungry I swan if it aint
discouragin Whats the use of you folks havin a cook If youre goin
to have canarybird appetites why dont you feed on bird seed and be
done with it And I do believe I never made a better pie than that

Wheres MaryGusta asked Zoeth

I dont know She went up to her room She may be there yet or she may
have come down and gone out againI dont know If she did come down I
didnt see her

Shadrach looked out of the window It had been a dark gloomy morning
and now it was beginning to rain The wind was whining through the tops
of the silverleafs and the moan of the breakers on the bar sounded with
a clearness which denoted the approach of a northeaster

Dirty weather observed the Captain And itll be dirtier yet before
night You better stay here in snug harbor this afternoon Zoeth Simmie
and the boy and MaryGusta and I can tend store all right Yes yes
you stay right here and keep dry Hope MaryGusta took an umbrella when
she went

I dont know as she has gone said Isaiah She may be upstairs in her
room yet Thats where she was

Shadrach after calling MaryGusta several times at the foot of the
stairs went up to make sure The door of Marys room was closed but as
he received no answer to his knock he opened it and entered Mary
was not there although it was evident that she had been there very
recently

Apparently she had been writing a letter for her writing case was
spread out upon the table Also the drawer in which she kept it had been
left open an unusual act of carelessness on her part for generally
speaking as her Uncle Shad said Nothins ever out of place in
MaryGustas room except some of the places and thats the carpenters
fault not hers

The Captain stepped over to close the drawer As he did so his attention
was attracted by a photograph lying upon a pile of photographs in a box
inside the drawer He picked up the photograph and looked at it It
was that of Edwin Smith taken when he seemed to be recovering from his
illness the one which showed him without a beard

Shadrachs eyes opened wide as he looked at the photograph He uttered
an exclamation stepped to the door of the upper hall and called
Zoeth Then he returned to the table and took from the drawer the next
photograph upon the pile in the box It was the old faded picture of
the partners of Hall and Company

Isaiah came stumbling up the stairs

Anythin I can do for you Capn Shad he asked Zoeth hes gone out
to shut up the barn door Rain was liable to beat in he said I told
him Id do it butGodfreys mighty

The Captain had paid no attention to him and he had entered the room and
approached his employer from behind Now over the latters shoulder he
saw the two photographs

Godfreys mighty cried the startled Isaiah

Shadrach turned and looked at him

Well he demanded whats the matter What are you starin like that

Well what about em Where did MaryGusta get em do you know
DidHere Where are you goin

II aint goin anywheres Im agoin downstairs I got my
dishwashin to do Ilet go of me Capn Shad I got to go this minute

But the Captain did not let go of him Instead keeping a firm hold upon
the collar of the frightened cook and steward he twisted him around
until he could look him straight in the eye This was difficult for
Isaiah plainly did not wish to be looked at in that manner

Humph grunted Captain Shad after a moments inspection Humph I
callate Ive got the right pig by the ear this time Set down in that
chair Isaiah Chase I want to talk to you




CHAPTER XXIX


The northeaster was developing It was now raining hard and the wind was
rising The gusts swept across the top of the little hill and the window
sashes of the Forard Lookout rattled and the hinges of the ancient
blinds squeaked The yard which had been so attractive was shorn of
its decorations The tables had been carried inside the lanterns taken
down the wonderful sign pride of the talented Mr Bemis had been
tenderly conveyed to the attic Cook waitresses and salesgirl had
departed The tearoom and gift shop had gone into winter quarters to
hibernate until the following spring

The rooms inside had been thoroughly swept and cleaned and most of the
furniture and the best of the old prints covered with dust cloths Some
of the smaller articles however were still upon the shelves of the
gift shop Mary having ordered her assistants to leave them there as
she wished to look them over herself before putting them away Some
of her selections for stock had sold remarkably well and she had been
obliged to reorder many times others of which she had been quite
confident when purchasing had not sold at all Both good sellers and bad
she meant to list as a guide to future choosing

She was listing them now Alone in the room which had once been the
sacred best parlor of the little house she was seated at the table
pencil in hand and memorandum books and paper before her There was no
particular reason why the listing should have been done that day it
might have been done any day until the weather became too cold to work
in an unheated house That morning she had had no idea of doing it
that afternoon She was doing it now because she felt that she must do
something to occupy her mind and because she wished to be alone
Up there at the Forard Lookout she could combine the twowork and
seclusion

When Mr Keith told at the store that morning the news of Edwin
Smithsor Edgar Farmersdeath she had been dreadfully shaken by it
It was so sudden so unexpectedwhen she last heard the man was so the
doctors said almost well She had thought of him often enough during
the past year or rather she had thought of Crawford as being with
him and of the fathers joy in his sons return to him and the knowledge
that his own disgraceful secret would not be revealed And she had
pictured Crawford as finding solace for his disappointed love in his
fathers society That Edgar Farmer had been what Isaiah called hima
blackguardshe realized perfectly but she was equally sure that as
Edwin Smith he had been the kindest and most loving of fathers And
Crawford although he had been willing to leave him because of her
loved him dearly

And now he was dead and Crawford was left alone Somehow she felt
responsible for the death That it had been hastened by the terrible
alarm and stress of the previous year was of course certain She
thought of Crawford alone and with this new sorrow and this thought
and that of her responsibility was almost more than she could bear

She felt that she must write him that he must know she had heard and
was thinking of him So after leaving the store she had hastened down
to the house and up the back stairs to her room There she had written a
few lines not more than a note but the composing of that note had been
a difficult task There was so much she longed to say and so little
she could say When it was written she remembered that Crawford was
in Boston and she did not know his address She determined to send the
letter to the Nevada home and trust to its being forwarded

She took from the back of the drawer the box of photographs and looked
them over As she was doing so Isaiah called her to dinner Then she
heard her uncles come in and because she felt that she could talk
with no one just then she avoided them by hastily going down the front
stairs She made a pretense of eating and left the house Isaiah did not
see her go After stopping at the store long enough to tell Mr Crocker
she would be at the tearoom that afternoon she climbed the hill
unlocked the door of the Forard Lookout entered and began her work

The wind howled and whined and the rain beat against the windows The
blinds creaked the sashes rattled the gusts moaned in the chimney
above the fireplace and all the hundred and one groanings and wailings
the complaints of an old house in a storm developed All these sounds
Mary heard absently her mind upon her work Then little by little
as they drew nearer she became conscious of other sounds footfalls
someone was coming up the walk

She did not rise from her chair nor look up from her work when the
outside door opened Even when the footsteps sounded in the little hall
behind her she did not turn

Yes Uncle Shad she said I am here and Im safe and Im perfectly
dry Also Im very very busy Now why did you come out in the rain to
hunt me up And Im quite sure you havent put on your rubbers

And then the voice behind her said Mary

She turned nowturned looked and rose to her feet Her face went
white then flushed red and then paled again

Oh she gasped

Crawford Smith was standing there His light overcoatit was not a
raincoatdripped water so did the hat in his hand He stood there and
lookedand dripped

Mary he said again

She caught her breath almost with a sob

You she exclaimed YOU Oh how could you WHY did you come

He took a step toward her Because I felt that I must he said I had
to come I came to see you once more You must forgive me

She did not speak He continued

You must forgive me for coming he said again There was a question
I had to ask and only you could answer it It isnt the question I
asked before although perhaps thatBut first I must tell you Mary my
father is dead

She nodded She could scarcely trust herself to speak but she tried

Yes yes she faltered II know

You know he repeated

Yes Mr Keith told us this morning He said he met you in Boston

Yes I had forgotten so he did

That is how I knew Oh Crawford I am so sorry for you I have been
writing you But WHY did you come here again Itit makes it so much
harder forfor both of us

He did not answer the question You knew my father was dead he said
again I wonderhe was speaking slowly and his gaze was fixed upon
her faceI wonder how much more you know

She started back How much she repeated How much moreOh what do
you mean

I mean how much did you know about my father when you and I were
togetherwhen I came on here and asked you to marry me

She put a hand to her throat Oh she cried breathlessly YOU know
He told you

Yes Mary he told me Before he died he told me everything And you
knew it I know now why you would not marry methe son of a thief

She looked at him in pained astonishment The tears sprang to her eyes
Oh how can you she exclaimed How can you say that to me How
can you think it As if that would make any difference I learned your
fathers name andand what he had doneby accident It was only the
night before you came It would have made no difference to me For
myself I didnt carebutOh Crawford how can you think it was
because he wasthat

His eyes were shining

I dont think it he cried triumphantly I never have thought it
Mary I believeever since I knew I have dared to believe that you
sent me away because you were trying to save me from disgrace You had
learned who and what my father had been and I did not know And you
feared that if you married me the secret might come out and I would
be ashamed my career would be spoiled and all that I have dared to
believe this and that is why I came back to youto ask if it was true
Cant you see I HAD to come IS it true Mary

He came toward her She would have run away if she could but there was
nowhere to run

Look at me Mary he commanded Look at me and tell me this It
wasnt because you didnt love me that you sent me away It wasnt
really that was it Tell me the truth Look at me now and tell me

She tried to look and she tried to speak but her glance faltered and
fell before his and the words would not come She could feel the blood
rushing to her cheeks She put up her hands in mute protest but the
protest was unavailing His arms were about her his kisses were upon
her lips and he was telling her the things which are told in times like
these And she struggled no longer but permitted herself to listen
to believe to accept and to be swept away by the wonderful current of
love and destiny against which she had fought so long

But the struggle was not entirely over She made one more effort

Oh Crawford she cried a little later Oh Crawford dear this is
all wrong It cant be It mustnt be Dont you see it mustnt We have
forgotten Uncle Zoeth He doesnt know whose son you are If he should
learn it would bring back the old story and the old trouble He isnt
well The shock might kill him

But Crawford merely smiled

He does know Mary he said Father wrote him I shall tell you
the whole story just as Dad told it to me Heaven knows it was not a
pleasant one for a son to hear but I am glad I heard it The past was
bad but it is past You and I have the future for our own and I mean to
make it a clean one and a happy one for us both God willing

Shadrach came up the path to the teahouse leading Isaiah by the arm
Mr Chase moved reluctantly as if led to execution or at the very
least to immediate trial for his life

Now then commanded Shadrach furl that umbrella and come along in
here with me I want you to make MaryGusta understand that youve told
me the whole business about your tellin her the Ed Farmer yarn
and all After that you can clear out because I want to talk to her
myself

He opened the door and still holding his captive by the arm strode
into the parlor There he stood stock still staring

Crawford held out his hand and the Captain found himself shaking it
warmly

Captain Gould he said I know now what I did not know until two
weeks ago how greatly my father wronged you and your partners I know
the whole miserable story But in spite of it I am here because I love
Mary and I want to marry her She has told me that she loves me I dont
know how you feel about it but I hope

The Captain interrupted Wait a minute he ordered Heave to and
come up into the wind a minute let me get my bearins Young feller
if youre goin to drop down out of the skies unexpected like this
youTut tut tut Whew He waited a moment then he said

MaryGusta come here

He held out his arms She came to him and he held her close

Is it so he asked Do you care for this young feller enough for
that Do you MaryGusta

He put his finger beneath her chin and lifted her head to look down into
her face The face was crimson

Do you MaryGusta he asked

Mary looked up weteyed but smiling

Yes Uncle Shad she said I think I do

And you want to cruise in his company all your life eh

Yes Uncle Shad but not unless you and Uncle Zoeth are willing

He bent and kissed her

Bless your heart dearie he said its all right Zoeth and me were
talkin about this very thing a little while ago And do you know what
he said He said What wrecked all our lives thirtyfive year ago
shant wreck these two if I can help it If MaryGusta cares for him
and he for her they shall have each other and be happy And well be
happy watchin their happiness Thats what he said I dont knows
I said Amen exactly but I thought it anyhow God bless you
MaryGusta Now you and Crawford go and see your Uncle Zoeth Hes down
at the house You just run along and tell him about it

Mary turned to Mr Chase

Well Isaiah she said havent you anything to say to me

Isaiah looked at Crawford and then at her

I should say youd better go somewheres both of you and get dry
he said His overcoats soakin wet and your waist aint much better
IIdont know what sort ofof congratulations oror whatever
they be I ought to say butbut I hope youll be terrible happy
MaryGusta

Thank you Isaiah laughed Mary

Yes youre welcome Now just let me talk to Capn Shad a minute

He swung about and faced the Captain and in his eye was triumph great
and complete

Capn Shad Gould crowed Isaiah a good many times in the last
four or five year youve called me a fool for heavin out hints that
somethin about like this was liable to happen Well WELL What have
you got to say NOW Whos the fool NOW Hey Who is




CHAPTER XXX


The story of MaryGusta Lathrop is almost told Before Crawford left
South Harniss which was not until the end of another week it had been
decided that on a day in June of the following year she should cease to
be MaryGusta Lathrop There was a great deal of discussion before this
decision was reached for many perplexing questions had to be answered

First there was the question of Crawfords future His father had left
a comfortable fortune and an interest in mining properties which would
have rendered it quite unnecessary for the young man to keep on with his
professional studies had he wished to discontinue them But he did not
so wish

As I think I told you that Sunday afternoon when we first met at Mrs
Wyeths Mary he said I have always intended to be a doctor Dad did
not want me to be he wanted me to come in with him but I wouldnt do
it I love my work and I mean to stick to it and go on with it If I
were as rich as a dozen Rockefellers it wouldnt make any difference
But as I see it I am not rich It is a grave question in my mind how
much of that money out there belongs to me

Mary nodded I think I understand what you mean she said

Yes I think there is no doubt that almost all of my fathers money
was made there in the West afterhe hesitated and then went onafter
thethe other died and after he married my mother But nevertheless I
shall always feel as if whatever there was belonged to your uncles
the surviving members of the old firm If I could I should give it to
them

Mary smiled Thank you for saying it dear she said and I know you
mean it but it would be no use to offer they wouldnt take it

I know they wouldnt So we must try and make it up to them in some
other way But suppose we leave that for a time and get back to my work
Im going to keep on with it I want to and you say that you want me
to

I do very much I am sure you will be happier in that work than in any
other and besidesI suppose I am ever so unpractical but I do
feel itI had rather you made your own way Somehow the idea of our
depending upon that money out there doesntdoesntOh I cant
explain exactly but I dont like the idea a bit

I know I prefer to paddle my own canoe if I can But a young doctors
canoe is likely to move pretty slowly at first And I intend taking a
passenger you know and I want her to be comfortable

Mary laughed a contented little laugh She will be she declared
Did I tell you of the talk Uncle Shad and I had the other day He
saw me sitting by the diningroom window looking out at nothing in
particularand looking silly enough too I dare sayand he asked me
what I was thinking I said Nothing much which wasnt true and he
said nothing must be good to think of I looked so cheerful I told
him I was Then I asked himmy conscience troubled me a little you
knowif he was sure that he and Uncle Zoeth were happy because I
shouldnt be unless they were

Well that was characteristic What did he say to that

Oh he laughed that big laugh of his and told me not to worry IM
feelin pretty average satisfied with life just now MaryGusta he
said and as for Zoethwell he asked me this mornin if I didnt
callate twas wicked for him and me to be so contented with the things
of this world so I know HES all right When Zoeth gets real happy he
always begins to feel sinful I hope that a consciousness of sin isnt
the only test of happiness she added because I dont believe you
feel wicked the least bit At least you have never said you did

Crawford laughed and there followed one of those interruptions to
conversation with which although undoubtedly interesting to the
participants outsiders are not supposed to be concerned When it was
over Mary said

Of course I am not so foolish as to mean that you must not touch the
money your father left That would be ridiculous But I mean I think we
should not depend upon it it should not change our plans or spoil your
life work or anything like that It will make life easier for us of
course and with its help we can make it easier for other people I
think that is what we should do with it

So do I my dear And our first duty it seems to me is toward your
uncles If they would consent and I suppose there isnt the least
chance that they would I should like to sell out the store and the
Lookout and the rest of it and take them with us wherever we decide to
go and give them an easy carefree time of it the rest of their lives

Mary shook her head They wouldnt like it a bit she said That
precious old store is the joy of their lives Without it they wouldnt
know what to do they would be as lost and lonesome and miserable as a
pair of stray kittens No if we take care of them we must take care of
Hamilton and Company too And we mustnt let them know were doing it
either she added with decision

Crawford looked troubled I suppose youre right he said but it
is likely to be something of a puzzle their problem It will mean of
course that you and I must go and leave them

Oh no we cant do thatnot for some time at any rate

It seems to me we must We have decided you and I that I shall go
back West finish my preparatory work then come here and marry you
After thatwell after that we have decided that I am to locate
somewhere or other and begin to practice my profession Youll go with
me then I presume

Silly Of course I will

I hoped so But if we cant leave your uncles and they wont leave the
store what are we going to do Put the store on a truck and take it
with us

She looked up at him and smiled I have a plan she said I havent
quite worked it out yet but if it does work I think its going to be a
very nice plan indeed No Im not going to tell you what it is yet so
you mustnt tease You dont mind my planning for you and bossing you
and all that sort of thing do you I hope you dont because I cant
help it Its the way Im made I think

I dont mind Boss away

Oh I shall Im like that Scotch girl in the play Mrs Wyeth took me
to see in BostonBunty her name was She made me think of myself more
than once although she was ever so much more clever At the end of the
play she said to her sweetheart William I must tell ye this if
I marry ye Ill aye be managin ye She meant she couldnt help it
Neither can I Im afraid Im a born manager

Crawford stooped and kissed her

Do you remember Williams answer he asked I do It was Bunty
Ill glory in my shame Manage all you like my lady Ill glory in
it

The plan did work out and it was this Doctor Harley who had practiced
medicine for fortyone years in South Harniss was thinking of retiring
after two more years of active work He was willing to sell out his
practice at the end of that time He liked Crawford had taken a fancy
to him on the occasion of his first visit to the town when he was a
guest of the Keiths Crawford after Mary had suggested the idea to him
called upon the old doctor Before the end of the week it was arranged
that after Crawfords final season of college and hospital work he
was to come to South Harniss work with Doctor Harley as assistant for
another year and then buy out the practice and as Captain Shad said
put up his own shingle

I dont mean to stay here always Crawford said but it will do me
good to be here for a time Harleys a tiptop old chap and a thoroughly
competent general practitioner Hell give me points that may be
invaluable by and by And a country practice is the best of training

Mary nodded Yes she said And at the end of this winter I shall
have Simeon Crocker well broken in as manager of the store And I can
sell the tearoom I think My uncles dont care much for that anyway
They will be perfectly happy with the store to putter about in and
with Simeon to take the hard work and care off their shoulders they can
putter to their hearts content

But suppose Simeon doesnt make it pay suggested Crawford Thats
at least a possibility Everyone isnt a NapoleonI should say a Queen
Elizabethof finance and business like yourself young lady

Marys confidence was not in the least shaken

It will pay she said If the townspeople and the summer cottagers
dont buy enoughwell you and I can help out There is that money in
the West you know

He nodded emphatically

Good he cried Youre right It will be a chance for usjust a
little chance And they will never know


He went away at the end of the week but he came back for Christmas
and again at Easter and again in the latter part of May And soon after
that on a day in early June he stood with Sam Keith at his elbow
in the parlor of the white house by the shore while Edna Keith played
Here Comes the Bride on the piano which had been hired for the
occasion and with her hand in Zoeths arm and with Captain Shadrach
and Barbara Howe just behind Mary walked between the two lines of
smiling teary friends to meet him

It was a lovely wedding everyone said so and as there probably never
was a wedding which was not pronounced lovely by friends and relatives
we may be doubly certain of the loveliness of this And there never was
a more beautiful bride All brides are beautiful more or less but this
one was more Isaiah who had been favored with a peep at the rehearsal
on the previous evening was found later on by Shadrach in the kitchen
in a state of ecstatic incoherence

I swan to godfreys cried Isaiah Aintaint she an angel though
Did you ever see anything prettiern she is in them clothes and with
thatthat moskeeter net on her head An angelyes siree one of them
cherrybins out of the Bible thats what she is And to think its our
MaryGusta Say Capn Shad will checkered pants be all right to wear
with my blue coat tomorrow I burnt a hole in my lavender ones tryin to
press the wrinkles out of em And I went down to the wharf in em last
Sunday and they smell considerble of fish besides

The wedding company was small but select Judge Baxter and his wife
were there and the KeithsMrs Keith condescended to ornament the
occasion some of the best people had seen fit to make much of Mary
Lathrop and Mrs Keith never permitted herself to be very far behind the
best people in anythingand Mrs Wyeth was there and Miss Pease and
Mr Green who had received an invitation and had come from Boston and
Doctor Harley and Simeon Crocker and his steady company one of the
tearoom young ladies and Annabel andandwell a dozen or fifteen
more

When the minister asked Who giveth this woman to this man Zoeth
answered bravely I dothat is me and Shadrach But no one laughed
because Zoeth himself was trying to smile and making rather wet weather
of it As for the Captain his expression during the ceremony was a
sort of fixed grin which he had assumed before entering the room and had
evidently determined to wear to the finish no matter what his emotions
might be But Miss Pease always susceptible had a delightful cry all
to herself and Isaiah retiring to the hall blew his nose with a vigor
which as Captain Shad said afterwards had the Pollack Rip foghorn
soundin like a deef and dumb sign

Mary had managed everything of course Her uncles had tried to
remonstrate with her telling her there were plenty of others to arrange
the flowers and attend to what the local newspaper would in its account
of the affair be sure to call the collation and to make the hundred
and one preparations necessary for even so small and simple a wedding as
this But she only laughed at their remonstrances

I wouldnt miss it for anything she said I have always wanted to
manage someones wedding and I am certainly not going to let anyone else
manage mine I dont care a bit whether it is the proper thing or not
This isnt going to be a formal affair I wont have it so Uncle Shad
if you want to say Jumpin fire when Crawford drops the ring as he is
almost sure to do you have my permission

But Crawford did not drop the ring and so the Captains favorite
exclamation was not uttered being unnecessary In fact there were no
mishaps everything went exactly as it should reception and collation
included and to quote from the South Harniss local once more A good
time was had by all

And when the bride and groom dressed in their traveling costumes came
down the stairs to the carriage which was to take them to the station
Mary ran back amid the shower of rice and confetti to kiss Uncle Zoeth
and Uncle Shad once more and whisper in their ears not to feel that she
had really gone because she hadnt but would be back in just a little
while

And I have told Isaiah about your rubbers and oilskins when it rains
she added in Shadrachs ear and he is not to forget Uncle Zoeths
medicine Goodby Goodby Dont be lonesome Promise that you wont

But to promise is easy and to keep that promise is often hard as
Shadrach observed when he and Zoeth were alone in the sittingroom that
evening I feel as if the whole vitals of this place had gone away on
that afternoon train the Captain admitted And yet I know its awful
foolish cause shell only be gone a couple of weeks

Im glad that question about the name is settled mused Zoeth That
kind of troubled me that did

The partners had worried not a little over the question of whether
Crawfords name was legally Smith or Farmer If it were Farmer and he
must be so called in South Harniss they feared the revival of the old
scandal and all its miserable gossip But when they asked Crawford he
reassured them

I consulted my lawyer about that he said My fathers middle name
was Smith that is why he took it I suppose Edwin Smith is not so very
different from Edgar Smith Farmer shorter thats all He and my mother
were married under the name of Smith Mother never knew he had had
another name I was born Smith and christened Smith and my lawyer
tells me that Smith I am If there had been any question I should have
petitioned to have the name changed

So that question was settled and Shadrach and Zoeth felt easier because
of it

Zoeth observed Shadrach after replying to his friends remark
concerning the name do you know what I kind of felt as if wed ought
to have had here this afternoon

No Shadrach replied Zoeth I dont What was it

Seemed to me wed ought to had one of them music box chairs Id
like to have put it under that Keith woman and seen her face when the
Campbells started to come Ho ho

What in the world made you think of that demanded his partner

Oh I dont know Thinkin about MaryGusta I callate set me to
rememberin how we fust met her and about Marcelluss funeral and all
That made me think of the chair you see I aint thought of it afore
for years

Zoeth nodded Shadrach he said that was a blessed day for you and
me the day when we brought that child home in our old buggy The Lord
put her there Shadrach

Well I guess likely He did maybe in a way of speakin Does seem so
thats a fact

Our lives was pretty sot and narrow afore she came Shes changed
everything

Thats so Hello Whats that noise I declare if it aint Isaiah
liftin up his voice in song In a hymn tune What do you think of
that

From the kitchen above the rattle of dishes Mr Chases nasal falsetto
quavered shrilly

 There shall be showers of blessins

The Captain interrupted

Hi youwhats your nameJennie Lindcome in here he hailed

Mr Chase appeared his arms dripping soapsuds What do you want
callin me out of my name he demanded

Want to know what started you singin about blessins Fust I thought
twas the weathervane squeakin What tuned you up eh

Isaiah looked rather foolish but he grinned

I was thinkin about MaryGusta he said

You was eh Well shes been a blessin to us theres no doubt about
that

Indeed she has concurred Zoeth

But Isaiah had the final word

Huh he declared shes moren one blessin shes a whole shower
Thats what set me to singin about em

He departed for the kitchen once more the falsetto rising triumphant

 There shall be showers of blessins
 Send em upon us oh Lord

Captain Shad looked after him Then he turned to his friend and partner
and said earnestly

Do you know Isaiahs gettin real kind of sensible in his old age

array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
