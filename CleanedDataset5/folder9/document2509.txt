THE LANI PEOPLE


By J F Bone




CHAPTER I

The boxed ad in the opportunities section of the Kardon Journal of
Allied Medical Sciences stood out like a cut diamond in a handful
of gravel Wanted it read Veterinarianfor residency in active
livestock operation Single recent graduate preferred Quarters and
service furnished Wellequipped hospital Fiveyear contract renewal
option starting salary 15000 crannum with periodic increases State
age school marital status and enclose recent tridi with application
Address Box V9 this journal

Jac Kennon read the box a second time There must be a catch to it
Nothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on the level
Fifteen thousand a year was top pay even on Beta and an offer like this
for a new graduate was unheard ofunless Kardon was in the middle of an
inflation But Kardon wasnt The planets financial status was A1
He knew Hed checked that immediately after landing Whatever might
be wrong with Kardon it wasnt her currency The rate of exchange was
121 Betan

A fiveyear contracthmmthat would be seventyfive thousand Figure
three thousand a year for living expenses that would leave sixtyplenty
of capital to start a clinic The banks couldnt turn him down if he had
that much cash collateral

Kennon chuckled wryly Hed better get the job before he started
spending the money he didnt have He had 231 credits plus a few
halves tenths and hundredths a diploma in veterinary medicine some
textbooks a few instruments and a firstclass spacemans ticket By
watching his expenses he had enough money to live here for a month and
if nothing came of his efforts to find a job on this planet there was
always his spacemans ticket and another world

Another world There were over six thousand planets in the Brotherhood
of Man At two months per planet not figuring transit time it would
take more than a thousand Galactic Standard years to visit them all and
a man could look forward to scarcely more than five hundred at best The
habitat of Man had become too large There wasnt time to explore every
possibility

But a man could have certain standards and look until he found a
position that fitted The trouble wasif the standards were too high
the jobs were too scarce Despite the chronic shortage of veterinarians
throughout the Brotherhood there was a peculiar reluctance on the part
of established practitioners to welcome recent graduates Most of the
ads in the professional journals read State salary desired which was
nothing more than economic blackmaila baldfaced attempt to get as
much for as little as possible Kennon grimaced wryly Hed be damned if
hed sell his training for six thousand a year Slave labor thats what
it was There were a dozen ads like that in the Journal Well hed give
them a trial but hed ask eight thousand and full GEA benefits Eight
years of school and two more as an intern were worth at least that

He pulled the portable voicewrite to a comfortable position in front of
the view wall and began composing another of the series of letters that
had begun months ago in time and parsecs away in space His voice was a
fluid counterpoint to the soft hum of the machine

And as he dictated his eyes took in the vista through the view
wall Albertsville was a nice town too young for slums too new for
overpopulation The white buildings were the color of winter butter in
the warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in the noonday heat It
nestled snugly in the center of a bowlshaped valley whose surrounding
forest clad hills gave mute confirmation to the fact that Kardon
was still primitive an unsettled world that had not yet reached the
explosive stage of population growth that presaged maturity But that
was no disadvantage In fact Kennon liked it Living could be fun on a
planet like this

It was abysmally crude compared to Beta but the Brotherhood had opened
Kardon less than five hundred years ago and in such a short time one
couldnt expect all the comforts of civilization

It required a high population density to supply them and while Kardon
was integrated its population was scarcely more than two hundred
million It would be some time yet before this world would achieve a
Class I status However a Class II planet had some advantages What it
lacked in conveniences it made up in opportunities and elbow room

A normal Betan would have despised this world but Kennon wasnt normal
although to the casual eye he was a typical representative of the
MedicoTechnological Civilization long legged fair haired and short
bodied with the typical Betan squint that left his eyes mere slits
behind thick lashes and heavy brows The difference was internal rather
than external

Possibly it was due to the fact that his father was the commander of a
Shortliner and most of his formative years had been spent in space To
Kennon accustomed to the timeless horror of hyper space all planets
were good broad open places where a man could breathe unfiltered air
and look for miles across distances unbroken by dually bulk heads and
safety shields On a planet there were spaciousness and freedom and
after the claustrophobic confinement of a hyper ship any world was
paradise Kennon sighed finished his letters and placed them in the
mail chute Perhaps this time there would be a favorable reply



CHAPTER II

Kennon was startled by the speed with which his letters were answered
Accustomed to the slower pace of Beta he had expected a week would
elapse before the first reply but within twentyfour hours nine of his
twelve inquiries were returned Five expressed the expected Thank you
but I feel that your asking salary is a bit high in view of your lack
of experience Three were frankly interested and requested a personal
interview And the last was the letter outstanding in its quietly
ostentatious folderthe reply from Box V9

Would Dr Kennon call at 10 AM tomorrow at the offices of
Outworld Enterprises Incorporated and bring this letter and suitable
identifications Kennon chuckled Would he There was no question about
it The address 200 Central Avenue was only a few blocks away In
fact he could see the building from his window a tall functional block
of durilium and plastic soaring above the others on the street the
sunlight gleaming off its clean square lines He eyed it curiously
wondering what he would find inside

  

The receptionist took his ID and the letter scanned them briefly
and slipped them into one of the message tubes beside her desk It will
only be a moment Doctor she said impersonally Would you care to sit
down 

Thank you he said The minute reflected could easily be an hour But
she was right It was only a minute until the message tube clicked
and popped a capsule onto the girls desk She opened it and removed
Kennons ID and a small yellow plastic rectangle Her eyes widened at
the sight of the plastic card

Here you are Doctor Take shaft number one Slip the card into the
scanner slot and youll be taken to the correct floor The offices you
want will be at the end of the corridor to the left Youll find any
other data you may need on the card in case you get lost She looked at
him with a curious mixture of surprise and respect as she handed him the
contents of the message tube

Kennon murmured an acknowledgment took the card and his ID and
entered the gravshaft There was the usual moment of heaviness as
the shaft whisked him upward and deposited him in front of a thickly
carpeted corridor

Executive level Kennon thought as he followed the receptionists
directions No wonder she had looked respectful But what was he doing
here The employment of a veterinarian wasnt important enough to demand
the attention of a senior executive The personnel section could handle
the details of his application as well as not He shrugged Perhaps
veterinarians were more important on Kardon He didnt know a thing
about this worlds customs

He opened the unmarked door at the end of the corridor entered a small
reception room smiled uncertainly at the woman behind the desk and
received an answering smile in return

Come right in Dr Kennon Mr Alexander is waiting for you

Alexander The entrepreneur himself Why Numb with surprise Kennon
watched the woman open the intercom on her desk

Sir Dr Kennon is here she said

Bring him in a smooth voice replied from the speaker Alexander X M
Alexander President of Outworld Enterprisesa lean dark wolfish man
in his early sixtieseyed Kennon with a flat predatory intentness that
was oddly disquieting His stare combined the analytical inspection
of the pathologist the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist and the
weighing appraisal of the butcher Kennons thoughts about Alexanders
youth vanished that instant Those eyes belonged to a leader on the
battlefield of galactic business

Kennon felt the conditioned respect for authority surge through him in
a smothering wave Grimly he fought it down knowing it was a sign of
weakness that would do him no good in the interview which lay ahead

So youre Kennon Alexander said His lingua franca was clean and
accentless I expected someone older

Frankly sir so did I Kennon replied

Alexander smiled an oddly pleasant smile that transformed the hard
straight lines in his face into friendly curves Business Dr Kennon
is not the sole property of age

Nor is a veterinary degree Kennon replied

True But one thinks of a Betan as someone ancient and sedate

Ours is an old planetbut we still have new generations

A fact most of us outsiders find hard to believe Alexander said I
picture your world as an ironclad society crystallized by age and custom
into something rigid and in flexible

You would be wrong to do so Kennon said Even though we are cultural
introverts there is plenty of dynamism within our society

How is it that you happen to be out here on the edge of civilization

I never said I was like my society Kennon grinned Actually I
suppose Im one of the proverbial bad apples

Theres more to it than that Alexander said Your early years
probably influenced you

Kennon looked sharply at the entrepreneur How much did the man really
know about him I suppose so he said indifferently

Alexander looked pleased But even with your childhood experiences
there must be an atavistic streak in youa throwback to your
adventurous Earth forebears who settled your world

Kennon shrugged Perhaps youre right I really dont know Actually
Ive never thought about it It merely seemed to me that an undeveloped
world offered more opportunity

It does Alexander said But it also offers more work If youre
figuring that you can get along on the minimum physical effort required
on the Central Worlds you have a shock coming

Im not that innocent Kennon said But I am not so stupid that I
cant apply modifications of Betan techniques to worlds as new as this

Alexander chuckled I like you he said suddenly Here read this and
see if youd care to work for me He picked a contract form from one of
the piles of paper on his desk and handed it to Kennon This is one
of our standard work contracts Take it back to your hotel and check it
over Ill expect to see you at this time tomorrow

Why waste time Kennon said The rapidreading technique originated
on Beta I can tell you in fifteen minutes

Hmm Certainly Read it here if you wish I like to get things
settledthe sooner the better Sit down young man and read You can
rouse me when youre finished He turned his attention to the papers on
his desk and within seconds was completely oblivious of Kennon his face
set in the rapt trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader

Kennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through
Alexanders hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of the
desk The man would do better he thought if he would have his staff
transcribe the papers to microfilm that could be read through an
intervaltimed scanner He might suggest that later As for now he
shrugged and seated himself in the chair beside the desk The quiet was
broken only by the rustle of paper as the two raptfaced men turned page
after page with mechanical regularity

Finally Kennon turned the last page paused blinked and performed
the necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time sense Alexander he
noticed was still engrossed sunk in his autohypnotic trance Kennon
waited until he had finished the legal folder which he was reading and
then gently intruded upon Alexanders concentration

Alexander looked up blankly and then went through the same mental
gyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before His eyes focused
and became hard and alert

Well he asked What do you think of it

I think its the damnedest trickiest most unilateral piece of
legalistics Ive ever seen Kennon said bluntly If thats the best
you can offer I wouldnt touch the job with a pair of forceps

Alexander smiled I see you read the fine print he said There was
quiet amusement in his voice So you dont like the contract

No sensible man would Im damned if Ill sign commitment papers just
to get a job No wonder youre having trouble getting professional help
If your contracts are all like that its a wonder anyone works for
you

We have no complaints from our employees Alexander said stiffly

How could you If they signed that contract youd have a perfect right
to muzzle them

There are other applicants for this post Alexander said

Then get one of them I wouldnt be interested

A spacemans ticket is a good thing to have Alexander said idly
Its a useful ace in the hole Besides you have had three other job
offersall of which are good even though they dont pay fifteen Ems a
year

Kennon did a quick double take Alexanders investigative staff was
better than good It was uncanny

But seriously Dr Kennon I am pleased that you do not like that
contract Frankly I wouldnt consider employing you if you did

Sir

That contract is a screen It weeds out the careless the fools and
the unfit in one operation A man who would sign a thing like that
has no place in my organization Alexander chuckled at Kennons blank
expression I see you have had no experience with screening contracts

I havent Kennon admitted On Beta the tests are formal The
MedicoPsych Division supervises them

Different worlds different methods Alexander observed But theyre
all directed toward the same goal Here we arent so civilized We
depend more on personal judgment He took another contract from one of
the drawers of his desk Take a look at this I think youll be more
satisfied

If you dont mind Ill read it now Kennon said

Alexander nodded

  

Its fair enough Kennon said except for Article Twelve

The personal privilege section

Yes

Well thats the contract You can take it or leave it

Ill leave it Kennon said Thank you for your time He rose to his
feet smiled at Alexander and turned to the door Dont bother to call
your receptionist he said I can find my way out

Just a minute Doctor Alexander said He was standing behind the
desk holding out his hand

Another test Kennon inquired

Alexander nodded The critical one he said Do you want the job

Of course

Without knowing more about it

The contract is adequate It defines my duties

And you think you can handle them

I know I can

I notice Alexander observed that you didnt object to other
provisions

No sir Theyre pretty rigid but for the salary you are paying I
figure you should have some rights Certainly you have the right to
protect your interests But that Article Twelve is a direct violation of
everything a human being should hold sacred besides being a violation
of the Peeper Laws Id never sign a contract that didnt carry a full
Peeper rider

Thats quite a bit

Thats the minimum Kennon corrected Naturally I wont object
to mnemonic erasure of matters pertaining to your business once my
contracts completed and I leave your employment But until then there
will be no conditioning no erasures no taps no snoopers and no
checkups other than the regular periodic psychans Ill consult with you
on vacation time and will arrange it to suit your convenience Ill even
agree to emergency recall but thats the limit Kennons voice was
flat

You realize Im agreeing to give you a great deal of personal liberty
Alexander said How can I protect myself

Ill sign a contingency rider Kennon said if you will specify
precisely what security matters I am not to reveal

I accept Alexander said Consider yourself hired He touched
a button on his desk Prepare a standard 2A contract for Dr
Jac Kennons signature And attach two riders a full PPyes no
exceptionsand a securityleak contingency Form 287C Yesthats
rightthat one And strike out all provisions of Article Twelve which
conflict with the Peeper Laws Yes Nowand finish it as soon as you
can He touched another button Well thats that he said I hope
youll enjoy being a member of our group

I think I shall Kennon said You know sir I would have waived part
of that last demand if you had cared to argue

I know it Alexander said But what concessions I could have wrung
from you would be relatively unimportant beside the fact that you would
be unhappy about them later What little I could have won here Id lose
elsewhere And since I want you Id prefer to have you satisfied

I see Kennon said Actually he didnt see at all He looked curiously
at the entrepreneur Alexander couldnt be as easy as he seemed
Objectivity and dispassionate weighing and balancing were nice traits
and very helpful ones but in the bear pit of galactic business they
wouldnt keep their owner alive for five minutes The interworld trade
sharks would have skinned him long ago and divided the stripped carcass
of his company between them

But Outworld was a respected company The exchange reports said
sowhich made Alexander a different breed of cat entirely Still his
surface was perfectpolished and impenetrable as a duralloy turret on
one of the latest Brotherhood battleships Kennon regretted he wasnt a
sensitive It would be nice to know what Alexander really was

Tell me sir Kennon asked What are the real reasons that make you
think Im the man you want

And youre the young man whos so insistent on a personal privacy
rider Alexander chuckled However theres no harm telling you There
are several reasons

Youre from a culture whose name is a byword for moral integrity That
makes you a good risk so far as your ethics are concerned In addition
youre the product of one of the finest educational systems in the
galaxyand you have proven your intelligence to my satisfaction You
also showed me that you werent a spineless yes man And finally you
have a spirit of adventure Not one in a million of your people would do
what you have done What more could an entrepreneur ask of a prospective
employee

Kennon sighed and gave up Alexander wasnt going to reveal a thing

All I hope Alexander continued affably is that youll find Outworld
Enterprises as attractive as did your predecessor Dr Williamson He was
with us until he died last monthbetter than a hundred years

Died rather young didnt he

Not exactly he was nearly four hundred when he joined us My
grandfather was essentially conservative He liked older men and Old
Doc was one of his choicesa good one too He was worth every credit
we paid him

Ill try to do as well Kennon said but Id like to warn you that I
have no intention of staying as long as he did I want to build a clinic
and I figure sixty thousand is about enough to get started

When will you veterinarians ever learn to be organization men
Alexander asked Youre as independent as tomcats

Kennon grinned Its a breed characteristic I guess

Alexander shrugged Perhaps youll change your mind after youve worked
for us

Possibly but I doubt it

Tell me that five years from now Alexander saidAhhere are
the contracts He smiled at the trim secretary who entered the room
carrying a stack of papers

The riders are as you asked sir the girl said

Good Now Doctor if you please

You dont mind if I check them Kennon asked

Not at all And when youre through just leave them on the
deskexcept for your copy of course Alexander scrawled his signature
on the bottom of each contract Dont disturb me Ill be in contact
with you Leave your whereabouts with your hotel He turned to the
papers in front of him and then looked up for the last time Just one
more thing he said You impress me as a cautious man It would be
just as well if you carried your caution with you when you leave this
room

Kennon nodded and Alexander turned back to his work



CHAPTER III

Id never have guessed yesterday that Id be here today Kennon said
as he looked down at the yellow waters of the Xantline Sea flashing to
the rear of the airboat at a steady thousand kilometers per hour as they
sped westward in the middle traffic level The water some ten thousand
meters below had been completely empty for hours as the craft hurtled
through the equatorial air

We have to move fast to stay ahead of our ulcers Alexander said
with a wry smile Besides I wanted to get away from the Albertsville
offices for awhile

Three hours notice Kennon said Thats almost too fast

You had nothing to keep you in the city and neither did Iat least
nothing important There are plenty of females where we are going and
I need you on Floranot in Albertsville Besides I can get you there
faster than if you waited for a company transport

Judging from those empty sea lanes below Flora must be an
outoftheway place Kennon said

It is Its out of the trade lanes Most of the commercial traffic is
in the southern hemisphere The northern hemisphere is practically
all water Except for Flora and the Otpens there isnt a land area for
nearly three thousand kilometers in any direction and since the company
owns Flora and the surrounding island groups theres no reason for
shipping to come there We have our own supply vessels a Discovery
Charter and a desire for privacyAh It wont be long now Theres
the Otpens Alexander pointed at a smudge on the horizon that quickly
resolved into an irregular chain of tiny islets that slipped below them
Kennon got a glimpse of gray concrete on one of the larger islands a
smudge of green trees and white beaches against which the yellow waters
dashed in smothers of foam

Ruggedlooking place he murmured

Most of them are deserted Two support search and warning stations and
automatic interceptors to protect our property Looktheres Flora
Alexander gestured at the land mass that appeared below

Flora was a great green oval two hundred kilometers long and about a
hundred wide

Pretty isnt it Alexander said as they sped over the low range
of hills and the single gaunt volcano filling the eastward end of
the island and swept over a broad green valley dotted with fields
and orchards interspersed at intervals by redroofed structures whose
purpose was obvious

Our farms Alexander said redundantly The airboat crossed a
fairsized river Thats the Styx Alexander said Grandfather named
it He was a classicist in his wayspent a lot of his time reading
books most people never heard of Things like the Iliad and Gone with
the Wind The mountains he called the Apennines and that volcanos
Mount Olympus The marshland to the north is called the Pontine
Marshesour main road is the Camino Real Alexander grinned Theres
a lot of Earth on Flora Youll find it in every name Grandfather
was an Earthman and he used to get nostalgic for the homeworld
Welltheres Alexandria coming up Weve just about reached the end of
the line

Kennon stared down at the huge graygreen citadel resting on a small
hill in the center of an open plain It was a Class II Fortalice built
on the efficient starshaped plan of half a millennium agoan ugly
spiky pile of durilium squat and massive with defensive shields and
weapons which could still withstand hours of assault by the most modern
forces

Why did he build a thing like that Kennon asked

Alexandriawell we had trouble with the natives when we first came
and Grandfather had a synthesizer and tapes for a Fortalice in his
ship So he built it It serves the dual purpose of base and house Its
mostly house now but its still capable of being defended

And those outbuildings

Theyre part of your job

The airboat braked sharply and settled with a smooth sickeningly
swift rush that left Kennon gaspingfeeling that his stomach was still
floating above him in the middle level He never had become accustomed
to an arbutus landing characteristics Spacers were slower and steadier
The ship landed gently on a pitted concrete slab near the massive
radiation shields of the barricaded entranceway to the fortress
Projectors in polished dually turrets swivelled to point their ugly
noses at them It gave Kennon a queasy feeling He never liked to trust
his future to automatic machinery If the analyzers failed to decode the
ships ID properly Kennon Alexander the ship and a fair slice of
surrounding territory would become an incandescent mass of dissociated
atoms

Grandfather was a good builder Alexander said proudly Those
projectors have been mounted nearly four hundred years and theyre still
as good as the day they were installed

I can see that Kennon said uncomfortably You ought to dismantle
them Theyre enough to give a man the weebies

Alexander chuckled Ohtheyre safe The firing mechanisms safetied
But we keep them in operating condition You never can tell when theyll
come in handy

I knew Kardon was primitive but I didnt think it was that bad Whats
the trouble

Noneright now Alexander said obliquely and since weve shown we
can handle ourselves there probably wont be any more

You must raise some pretty valuable stock if the competition tried to
rustle them in the face of that armament

We do Alexander said Now if youll follow methe entrepreneur
opened the cabin door letting in a blast of heat and a flood of yellow
sunlight

Great Arthur Fleming Kennon exploded This place is a furnace

Its hot out here on the strip Alexander admitted but its cool
enough inside Besides youll get used to this quickly enoughand
the nights are wonderful The evening rains cool things off Wellcome
along He began walking toward the arched entrance to the great
building some hundred meters away Kennon followed looking around
curiously So this was to be his home for the next five years It didnt
look particularly inviting There was a forbidding air about the place
that was in stark contrast to its pleasant surroundings

They were only a few meters from the archway when a stir of movement
came from its shadowthe first life Kennon had seen since they
descended from the ship In this furnace heat even the air was quiet
Two women came out of the darkness moving with quiet graceful steps
across the blistering hot concrete They were naked except for a
loincloth halter and sandals and so nearly identical in form and
feature that Kennon took them to be twins Their skins were burned a
deep brown that glistened in the yellow sun light

Kennon shrugged It was none of his business how his employer ran his
household or what his servants wore or didnt wear Santos was a planet
of nudists and certainly this hot sun was fully as brilliant as the one
which warmed that tropical planet In fact he could see some virtue in
wearing as little as possible Already he was perspiring

The two women walked past them toward the airboat Kennon turned to
look at them and noticed with surprise that they werent human The long
tails curled below their spinal bases were adequate denials of human
ancestry

Humanoids he gasped For a moment I thought

Gave you a starteh Alexander chuckled It always does when a
stranger sees a Lani for the first time Wellnow youve seen some of
the livestock what do you think of them

I think you should have hired a medic

Alexander shook his head Noit wouldnt be reason able or legal
Youre the man for the job

But Ive no experience with humanoid types We didnt cover that phase
in our studiesand from their appearance theyd qualify as humans
anywhere if it werent for those tails

Theyre far more similar than you think Alexander said It just goes
to show what parallel evolution can do But there are differences

I never knew that there was indigenous humanoid life on Kardon Kennon
continued The manual says nothing about it

Naturally Theyre indigenous only to this area




Thats impossible Species as highly organized as that simply dont
originate on isolated islands

This was a subcontinent once Alexander said Most of it has been
inundated Less than a quarter of a million years ago there was over a
hundred times the land area in this region than exists today Then the
ocean rose Now all thats left is the mid continent plateau and a few
mountain tops You noted I suppose that this is mature topography
except for that range of hills to the east The whole land area at the
time of flooding was virtually a peneplain A rise of a few hundred feet
in the ocean level was all that was needed to drown most of the land

I see Yes its possible that life could have developed here under
those conditions A peneplain topography argues permanence for hundreds
of millions of years

You have studied geology Alexander asked curiously Only as part of
my cultural base Kennon said Merely a casual acquaintance

We think the Lani were survivors of that catastropheand with their
primitive culture they were unable to reach the other land masses
Alexander shrugged At any rate they never established themselves
anywhere else

How did you happen to come here

I was born here Alexander said My grandfather discovered this world
better than four hundred years ago He picked this area because it all
could be comfortably included in Discovery Rights It wasnt until years
afterward that he realized the ecological peculiarities of this region

He certainly capitalized on them

There was plenty of opportunity The plants and animals here are
different from others in this world Like Australia in reverse

Kennon looked blank and Alexander chuckled Australia was a
subcontinent on Earth he explained Its ecology however was
exceedingly primitive when compared with the rest of the planet Floras
on the contrary wasand isexceedingly advanced when compared with
other native life forms on Kardon

Your grandfather stumbled on a real bonanza Kennon said

For which Im grateful Alexander grinned Its made me the biggest
operator in this sector of the galaxy For practical purposes I own an
independent nation Theres about a thousand humans here and nearly six
thousand Lani Were increasing the Lani now since we found they have
commercial possibilities Up to thirty years ago we merely used them for
labor

Kennon didnt speculate on what Alexander meant He knew For practical
purposes his employer was a slave traderor would have been if the
natives were human As it was the analogy was so close that it wasnt
funny

They entered the fortress passed through a decontamination chamber that
would have done credit to an exploration ship and emerged dressed in
tunics and sandals that were far more appropriate and comfortable in
this tropical climate

Thats one of Old Docs ideas Alexander said gesturing at the door
from which they had emerged He was a hound for sanitation and he
infected us with the habit He turned and led the way down an arched
corridor that opened into a huge circular room studded with iris doors

Kennon sucked his breath in with a low gasp of amazement The room was
a gem of exquisite beauty The parquet floor was inlaid with rare
hardwoods from a hundred different worlds Parthian marble veneer
covered with lacy Van tapestries from Santos formed the walls Delicate
ceramics sculpture and bronzes reflected the art of a score of
different civilizations A circular pool festooned with lacelike
Halsite ferns stood in the center of the room surrounding a polished
black granite pedestal on which stood an exquisite bronze of four Lani
females industriously and eternally pouring golden water from vases held
in their shapely hands Beautiful Kennon said softly

We like it Alexander said

We

Oh yesI forgot to tell you about the Family Alexander said grimly
I run Outworld and own fifty per cent of it The Family owns the other
fifty There are eight of themthe finest collection of parasites
in the entire galaxy At the moment they cant block me since I also
control my cousin Douglass shares But when Douglas comes of age they
will be troublesome Therefore I defer to them I dont want to build a
united opposition Usually I can get one or more of them to vote with
me on critical deals but I always have to pay for their support
Alexanders voice was bitter as he touched the dilate button on the iris
door beside him Youll have to meet them tonight Theres five of them
here now

That isnt in the contract Kennon said He was appalled at Alexander
Civilized people didnt speak of others that way even to intimates

It cant be helped You must meet them Its part of the job
Alexanders voice was grim Mother Cousin Anne Douglas and Eloise
like to play lord of the manor Cousin Harold doesnt carefor which
you should be grateful

The door dilated and Alexander ushered Kennon into the room The Lani
sitting on the couch opposite the door leaped to her feet her mouth
opening in an O of surprise Her soft snowwhite hair creamy skin and
bright china blue eyes were a startling contrast to her black loincloth
and halter Kennon stared appreciatively

Her effect on Alexander however was entirely different His face
darkened You he snapped What are you doing here

Serving sir the Lani said

On whose authority

Man Douglas sir

Alexander groaned You see he said turning to Kennon We
need someone here with a little sense Like I was telling you the
Familydhe stopped abruptly and turned back to the Lani Your name
and pedigree he demanded

Silver Dawn sirout of White Magicplatinum experimental
typestrain four

I thought so How long have you been inhouse

Almost a month sir

Youre terminated Report to Goldie and tell her that Man Alexander
wants you sent back to your group

The Lanis eyes widened Man AlexanderYou

Alexander nodded

Gosh she breathed The big boss

Get moving Alexander snapped and tell Goldie to report to me in my
quarters

Yes sir right away sir The Lath ran disappearing through the door
they had entered with a flash of shapely white limbs

That Douglas Alexander growled Leave that young fool alone here
for six months and hed disrupt the entire operation The nerve of that
young puprequisitioning an experimental type for household labor Just
what does he think hes doing

The question obviously didnt demand a reply so Kennon kept discreetly
silent as Alexander crossed the room to the two doors flanking the
couch on which the Lani had sat He opened the lefthand one revealing a
modern gravshaft that carried them swiftly to the uppermost level They
walked down a short corridor and stopped before another door It opened
into a suite furnished with stark functional simplicity It fitted the
entrepreneurs outward personality so exactly that Kennon had no doubt
that this was Alexanders quarters

Sit down Kennon Relax while you can Alexander said as he dropped
into a chair and crossed his sandaled feet

Im sure you have many questions but they can wait

You might as well get some rest Youll have little enough later The
Family will probably put you through the meat grinder but remember that
they dont control this business Youre my man

Kennon had hardly seated himself in another chair when the door opened
and a plump pinkskinned Lani entered She was considerably older
than the silverhaired one he had seen earlier and her round face was
smiling

Ah Goldie Alexander said I understand Man Douglas has been giving
you quite a time

Its high time you came back sir she said Since Old Doc died Man
Douglas has been impossible Hes been culling the staff and replacing
them with emptyheaded fillies whose only claim to usefulness is that
they can fill out a halter Pretty soon this place will be a pigsty

Ill take care of that Alexander promised Now Id like you to meet
Old Docs replacement This is Dr Kennon our new veterinarian

Pleased Im sure Goldie said You look like a nice man

He is Alexander said but hes just as hard as Old Docand hell
have the same powers Goldies the head housekeeper Alexander added
Shes an expert and youd do well to take her advice on assignments

Kennon nodded

Have a maid bring us a light meal and something to drink Alexander
said Have a couple of porters take Dr Kennons things to Old Docs
house Find Man Douglas and tell him I want to see him at once Tell the
Family that Ive arrived and will see them in the Main Lounge at eight
tonight Tell Blalok Ill be seeing him at nine Thats all

Yes sir Goldie said and left the room her tail curling buoyantly

A good Lani Alexander commented One of the best Loyal
trustworthy intelligent Shes been running Alexandria for the past ten
years and should be good for at least ten more

Tenhow old is she

Thirty

Thirtyyears

Alexander nodded

Good Lord Lister Id have guessed her at least three hundred

Wrong life scale Lani only live about one tenth as long as we do
Theyre mature at twelve and dead at fifty

Alexander sighed Thats another difference Even without agerone wed
live to be a hundred

Have you tried gerontological injections

Once They produced death in about two days Killed five Lani with
them Alexanders face darkened at an unpleasant memory So we dont
try any more he said There are too many differences He stretched
Id tell you more about them but itll be better to hear it from Evald
Blalok Hes our superintendent Steve Jordan can tell you a lot too
He runs the Lani Division But right now lets wait for Cousin Douglas
The pup will take his time about comingbut hell do it in the end
Hes afraid not to

Id rather not Kennon said Its poor manners to be injected into a
family affairespecially when Im just one of the employees

Youre not just one of the employees You are the Station Veterinarian
and as such you hold an authority second only to Blalok and myself You
and Blalok are my hands ears and eyes on Flora You are responsible
to meand to me alone While I defer at times to the desires of
the Family I do not have to I run Outworld Enterprises and all the
extensions of that organization I possess controland the Family knows
it My men are respected and furthermore they know everything that goes
on He smiled icily In a way its quite a healthy situation It
keeps my relatives under control Somehow they dislike being disciplined
before outsiders Now think no more about it Alexander stood up and
walked over to one of the windows opening onto the broad roof gardens
and stood looking at the sundrenched greenery

Odd isnt it Alexander said how beautiful nature is and how simple
things are in a state of nature Its only when man interjects himself
onto a scene that things get complicated Take Flora for instance
Before Grandfather came here it must have been a pleasant place with
the simple natives happy in their paradise But thats all changed
now We have taken overand they like other lesser creatures on other
worlds have been bent to our will and uses I could pity them but
being human I cannot afford that luxury

Kennon understood He too had felt that sensation that odd tightening
of the throat when he first saw a Varl on Santos The Varl had been the
dominant life form there until men had come Now they were just another
animal added to humanitys growing list of pets and livestock The
little Varl with their softfurred bodies and clever sixfingered hands
made excellent pets and precision workmen The products of those clever
hands the tiny instruments the delicate microminiaturized control
circuits the incredibly fine lacework and tapestries formed the bulk
of Santos interstellar trade

He had owned a Varl once and had delighted in its almost human
intelligence But the Varl werent human and there lay their tragedy
Two thousand years of human domination had left them completely
dependent on their conquerors They were merely intelligent animalsand
that was all they would ever be until the human race changed its
cultural pattern or was overthrown The one alternative was as unlikely
as the other Humanity had met some fierce competitors but none with
its explosive acquisitive nature and none with its drive to conquer
colonize and rule And probably it never would

The little Varl were one race among hundreds that had fallen before the
fierceness and the greed of men But unlike most others the Varl were
not combative Therefore they had survived

Yet had it been necessary to reduce them to slavery They would never
be a threat Not only were they essentially gentle and noncombative but
their delicate bodies could not stand the strains of spaceflight
They were trapped on their world Why should they be forced into so
subordinate a roleWhy was humanity so jealous of its dominance
that no other species could exist except by sufferance Why after five
thousand years of exploration invasion and colonization did the human
race still consider the galaxy as its oyster and themselves uniquely
qualified to hold the knife He hadnt thought this way since he had
given the Varl to his girl friend of the moment and had blasted off for
Beta Now the questions returned to haunt him As a Betan the haunting
was even more acute since Beta had a related problem that was already
troublesome and would become more acute as the years passed

He shrugged and laid the thought aside as a slim darkhaired Lani
entered pushing a service cart ahead of her The two men ate silently
each busy with his own thoughts And behind the view wall of Alexanders
apartment Kardons brilliant yellow sun sank slowly toward the horizon
filling the sky with flaming colors of red and gold rimmed by the blues
and purples of approaching night The sunset was gaudy and blatant
Kennon thought with mild distaste unlike the restful dayend displays
of his homeworld



CHAPTER IV

Douglas Alexander was a puffyfaced youngster with small intolerant
eyes set in folds of fat above a button nose and a looselipped sensual
mouth There was an odd expression of defiance overlaid with fear on his
pudgy features Looking at him Kennon was reminded of a frightened dog
ready either to bite or cower

But it wasnt Douglas who held his eye It was the two Lani who followed
him into the room Every line of their bodies was perfection that spoke
volumes about generations of breeding for physical elegance They moved
with a coordinated grace that made Douglas look even more clumsy by
contrast And they were identical twin creamandgold works of art
They were completely nudeand Kennon for the first time in his life
fully appreciated the beauty of an unclad female To cover them would
be sacrilege and ornaments would only detract from their exquisite
perfection

Kennon knew that he was staring like an idiot Alexanders amused smile
told him that much With an effort he composed his startled features

The pair looked at him with soft violet eyesand it was as though some
psychic bathhouse attendant had poured ice water down his spine For he
had seen that look before that liquid introspective look in the velvet
eyes of cattle He shivered For a moment he had been thinking of them
as human And somehow the lack of that indefinable some thing called
humanity robbed them of much of their glamour They were still
beautiful but their beauty had become impersonal


Dont take these as representative of the Lani Alexander said
suddenly Theyre a special case a very special case He glared at
his cousin Damn your impudence he said without beat I sent for
younot your toys Send them away

Douglas sulkily thrust out his lower lip You cant talk to me like
that Cousin Alex he began Im just a

You heard me Douglas Out Alexanders voice didnt rise but it cut
like a whip

Oh very well Douglas said I cant fight youyet He turned to
the humanoids You heard the Bossman Go home

The two nodded in unison and departed quickly Somehow Kennon got the
impression that they were happy to leave

Just wait Douglas said You cant boss me forever Just wait Ill
reach my majority in five years I can vote my shares thenand then
Ill fix you You wont be so high and mighty then Mr Big Ill throw
in with the rest of the Family They dont like you too much

Dont hold your breath waiting for the Family to help you Alexander
said They wouldnt have anyone else but me handle the finances They
love money too much And until you get your inheritance remember one
thingIm master here

I know it Douglas said and then curiouslyWhos the oddball He
gestured at Kennon with a pudgy thumb

Our new veterinarian Dr Kennon

Ohgreat Now you tell me

Theres nothing like making a good first impression Alexander said
with ironic emphasis I hope he cuts you off from the Lani Hell have
the authority to do it since hes taking Old Docs place

He cant Im an owner I own

You own nothing Youre a minor And under the terms of Grandfathers
will youll own nothing except an allowance until you reach legal age
And that brings me to the reason I brought you here Just when did you
gain the right to reorganize the household staff Just when did you get
the power to interfere with the experimental program

Douglas flushed dull red and bit his lip Do we have to go into this in
front of strangers

Kennons my agent Alexander said coldly and he might as well learn
about you and the others from the start

Wellwhat do you want him to dowatch me crawl Douglas asked
bitterly Youll make me do it You always do Do you want me to beg
to say I was wrong to promise I wont do it again

Youve done that already Alexander said Several times You need a
lesson I wont have you meddling with valuable animals

And what are you going to do about it

Put you where you can do no more damage As of tomorrow youll go to
Otpen One

Douglas paled His lips quivered and his eyes flicked uneasily as
he watched Alexanders granite face You dont mean that he said
finally Youre joking

I never joke about business

But you cant do that Ill tell the Family They wont let you

I already have their consent Alexander said I obtained it after
your last escapade Youll be happy out there You can play tin god all
you like Master of life and death on a twoacre island No one will
mind You can also go to work No one will mind that either And
Mullins wont mind as long as you leave the troops alone Now get out of
here and get packed Youre leaving tomorrow morning

But cousin Alex

Move Im tired of the sight of you Alexander said

Douglas turned and shambled out of the room His ego was thoroughly
deflated and he seemed more frightened than before Obviously the Otpens
werent the pleasantest place in this world

Theyre a military post Alexander said And Commander Mullins
doesnt like Douglas Cant say that I blame him Douglas is a
thoroughly unpleasant specimen and incidentally quite typical of the
rest of the Family Alexander sighed and spread his hands in a gesture
that combined disgust and resignation Sometimes I wonder why I have
been cursed with my relatives

Kennon nodded The implications behind the empty eyes of Douglass Lani
sickened him There were several ways to produce that expression all of
them unpleasant Hypnoconditioning the Quiet Treatment brainburning
transorbital leukotomy lobectomyall of the products of that diseased
period of humanitys thinking when men tampered with the brains of other
men in an effort to cure psychic states Psychiatry had passed that
period at least on the civilized worlds where even animal experiments
were frowned upon as unnecessary cruelty

You saw those two Lani Alexander said Grandfather had them made
that way as a birthday present for Douglas He was getting senile He
died a year later Youd think a man would be ashamed to keep things
like that aroundbut not Douglas He likes them Alexanders voice was
tinged with contempt He knows they disgust meso he parades them in
I could strangle that pup sometimes

I wondered about it I wouldnt like to work for a man who permitted
such things

That was done before I took over For the past three years there have
been no dockings no mutilations I cant see treating a helpless animal
like that

I feel better about it Kennon said I didnt think you were that
sort

Understand me Alexander said Im always opposed to senseless
cruelty and wasteparticularly when its dangerous Docked Lani are the
height of stupidity Just because someone wants a pet that is an exact
duplicate of a human being is no reason to risk a court action Those
Lani and a few others whose tails have been docked could be a legal
bombshell if they ever left Flora

Kennon was jolted He had been thinking of mental mutilation and
Alexander had been talking physical Naturally they would be dangerous
property Anyone attempting to sell a docked Lani would probably be
thrown in Detention and charged with slave trading

Did you ever figure the cost of taking a legal action through our court
system Alexander asked Even the small ones set you back four or five
thousand and a firstclass action like a Humanity Trial could cost
over a million Grandfather found that out Sure there are differences
between Lani and humans but a smart lawyer can make them seem trivial
until the final test and that would drag on for nearly two years until
all the requirements were satisfiedand by that time the unfavorable
publicity would drop sales to zero The Family would be on my neck for
lost dividends and Id lose much of the control I hold over them

Sure its possible that prehensile tails could be produced by
mutation but so far as we know it hasnt happened in human history As
a result the tail serves as a trademarksomething that can be easily
recognized by anyone So we sell them intact Alexander crossed his
legs and settled back in his chair Shocks you doesnt it

Kennon nodded Yes he admitted It does

I know You cant help it Most of our new employees think the Lani are
humanat first They learn better but adjustment is always a strain
They keep confusing external appearances with the true article But
remember thisLani are not human Theyre animals And on this island
theyre treated as what they areno more no less They are a part
of our economics and are bred fed and managed according to sound
livestock principles Despite some of the things you may see here in
Alexandria dont forget that You are a veterinarian Your job is to
handle disease problems in animals Lani are animals Therefore you will
be doing your job I was disappointed in your reaction when you first
saw them but I suppose it was natural At any rate this should clear
the air

It doesintellectually Kennon admitted But the physical
resemblance is so close that it is difficult to accept

Alexander smiled Dont worry Youll accept it in time Now I think
its time that you met the Family



CHAPTER V

The main salon was crowded The huge room glittering with mirrors and
crystal floored with thick carpets and hung with rich drapes had
something of the appearance of a Sarkian harem Although there were only
five of the Alexander family present there were at least twenty
Lani whose costumes ranged from the black G string and halter of the
household staff to the utter nudity of Douglass playthings They were
all female and Kennon wondered for a moment what a male was like

Besides Alexander there were two men and three women Douglas still
with his sulky expression an older man in his late nineties who looked
like Douglass elder brother two mature women who could be any age from
fifty to three hundred and a girl She might have been thirtyperhaps
younger perhaps older a lean feminine edition of Alexander with the
same intriguing face and veiled predatory look There was a hardness
about her that was absent in the others Kennon had the feeling that
whatever this girl did she didnt do it half way

My sister Eloise Alexander said in a low voice Watch out for her
Shes as deadly as a puff adder and she collects men The other man is
Douglass father Henry The plump redhead beside him is his wife Anne
The other woman is my mother Clara even though Eloise and I dont look
like her We take after Father

Wheres he Kennon whispered

Dead Alexander replied He was killed twenty years ago

Id like to present Dr Jac Kennon our new veterinarian Alexander
said into the hush that followed their entrance The introductions that
followed were in proper form and Kennon was beginning to feel more at
ease until Eloise sent one of her Lani with a summons He looked around
for Alexander but the entrepreneur was the center of a threecornered
argument hemmed in by Douglas Henry and Anne Henrys voice was
raised in bitter protest that Alexander was exceeding his authority He
shrugged There was no help there

All right he said tell your mistress Ill be along in a moment

Yes Doctor the Lani said but the Woman Eloise says for you to
come and she is not accustomed to being disobeyed

Tell her what I said Kennon replied I shall be there directly He
crossed to the table and examined it selecting a cluster of odd purple
fruit which looked more interesting than it tasted When he had finished
he walked leisurely over to where Eloise sat

She looked at him angrily I am accustomed to being obeyed by my
employees she said coldly Her dark eyes oddly like her brothers
traversed his hard body like twin scanners

He returned her appraising stare with one of his own Im not your
employee he said bluntly I was hired by your brother and theres
a full peeper rider on my contract His eyes traveled slowly over her
carefully arranged hair her makeup her jewelry at throat and
arms her painted finger and toenails and then across the slim
smallbreasted lines of her body half revealed under her thin
anklelength tunic of Lyranian silk

Satisfied she asked

On Beta he said bluntly your appearance would qualify you for a
parasite camp Six months of hard labor would do you no end of good
Youre soft lazy and undisciplined

Eloise gasped Why you she sputtered

And perhaps next time youll learn to be polite Kennon continued
imperturbably After all the superficial attributes of good breeding
are not too hard to counterfeit

To his surprise Eloise giggled You bite dont you she asked
Remind me to remember that

I shall

Of course your actions werent good breeding either

Admittedbut Ive never pretended to be what Im not Im the son of a
spaceship skipper and Im a veterinarian Thats all

Thats not all You are also a man Her face was sober Its been
some time since Ive met one Id almost forgotten they existed

Theres your brother

Alexhes a money making machine Comesit beside me and lets
talk

About what

Youmeyour job your lifeanything you wish

That line isnt exactly new Kennon grinned

I know she admitted but it usually works

Im immune

Thats what you think Eloises eyes were frankly appraising I think
I could become interested in you

I have a job here I dont think I would have time to give you the
attention youd demand

I get bored easily It probably wouldnt be long before I would be
tired of you

Perhapsand perhaps not I cant afford to take the chance

You seem confident

You forget I was a sailor

And spacemen have a reputation eh Eloise chuckled

At that you might be right I remember the first officer of she let
the thought die But I became tired of him she finished

Kennon smiled Ive never had that complaint

Perhaps youd like to make the acid test she asked

Perhaps he said But not tonight

Tomorrow then Alex will be leaving in the morning He never stays more
than a few hours Eloises eyes were bright her lips moist and red

Ill pick the time Kennon saidand added to himself If ever
Despite her wealth Eloise was no different from the portofcall girls
If anything she was worse since she had enough money to implement her
desires They were merely in the trade for business reasons NoEloise
would be something to steer clear of Alexander was right She was a
mantrap He stood up and bowed Betan fashion I see your brother is
free now He wants to brief me on my duties here We were discussing it
before we entered

Eloise pouted You can always do that

You said yourself that Alexander never stays here very long I would be
a poor employee if I delayed him He grinned knowingly at her and she
smiled back with complete understanding

Very well then Get your business done Your pleasure can wait

Kennon steered Alexander over to an open window that led to a balcony
Whew he said I see what you mean

Shes a tartar Alexander agreed I suspect that shes a
nymphomaniac

You suspect Kennon asked By this time you should know Lets get
out of here Ive had about all of your sister I care to take

Cant say as I blame you Ill show you to your quarters Maybe Old Doc
left a bottle or two although I suspect the old sinner hung on until
the last one was empty

If he had to put up with your relatives as a steady diet I cant say
that I blame him Kennon said

Careful Doctor Youre talking about my kinfolk Alexander said
wryly At that though you have a point The two men slipped quietly
from the room Apparently none of the Family was conscious of their
departure except Eloise who watched them leave with an enigmatic
expression on her narrow face

They left the fortress through the rear gate and walked slowly down the
winding path that led to the cluster of buildings in the valley below
It was a beautiful night calm and clear with the stars shining down
from the dark vault of the heavens The constellations were strange and
Kennon missed the moons Beta had three two of which were always in the
sky but Kardon was moonless Somehow it gave the sky an empty look

A damp coolness rose from the ground as the evening rain evaporated
mistily into the still air Kennon sniffed the odor of soil and growing
vegetation clean pleasant odors in contrast to what he had left In the
distance a bird called sleepily from one of the fortress turrets and was
answered by some creature Kennon couldnt identify A murmur of blended
sound came from the valley below punctuated by highpitched laughter
Someone was singing or perhaps chanting would be a better description
The melody was strange and the words unrecognizable The thin whine
of an atomotor in the fortresss generating plant slowly built up to a
keening undertone that blended into the pattern of halfperceived sound

Nice isnt it Alexander remarked as they rounded another turn on the
switchback path

Yes You cant hear a sound from back there except for that generator
Its almost as though we shut those people out of existence by merely
closing a door

I wish it were that simple Alexander said But doors that can be
closed can also be opened Wellthink youll like it here

I think so providing I dont have to entertain your relatives

You mean Eloise Dont worry about her Shes as fickle as the wind

Ive never seen anyone so frankly predatory Kennon said She worries
me

Theyll all be gone tomorrowexcept for Eloise Alexander said with
mock comfort Douglas is on the Otpens for a year and the others are
off somewhere

Youll be staying I suppose

NoIm afraid I cant

I hoped youd help me get organized This whole thing has been
something of a shock I was expecting something entirely different

Sorrysomeone has to run the business But Blalokll brief you
Actually hes more qualified than I He knows everything worth knowing
about this place Were going past his house in a minutewant to stop
in and see him

Its pretty late

Not for Blalok Hes a Mystica nocturnal Hes probably doing his
work now

Perhaps we shouldnt disturb him

Nonsense Hes used to it I visit him frequently at night

Surebut youre the boss

Wellin a sense you are too At least in the veterinary end of this
business Alexander swung sharply to the left and climbed a short
flight of stairs that led to the nearest house Lights flared on the
deep porch and the oldfashioned iris door dilated to frame the black
silhouette of a stocky broadshouldered man

Good evening sir he said I was expecting you That the new vet
with you

Your pipelines still working I see Alexander said Yes this is
Dr KennonEvald BlalokI wanted you two to meet

Kennon liked the gray middleaged man He looked honest and competent
a solid quiet man with a craggy face and the deepset eyes of a Mystic
His skin had the typical thickness and pore prominence of the dwellers
on that foggy world from which he came But unlike the natives of Myst
his skin was burned a dark brown by Kardons sun He seemed out of place
on this tropic world but Kennon reflected wryly that there was probably
more than one misplaced human here himself included

Ive been going over Station Fourteens records with Jordan Blalok
said as he ushered them into the house A tall blackhaired man rose as
they entered

Skip the formality Jordan Sit down Alexander said and meet Dr
KennonSteve JordanJordan runs the Lani Division

Kennon nodded acknowledgment as Alexander continued Whats this
trouble at Fourteen

I dont know Weve got an epizootic of something Another youngster
died this morning and theres three more that look pretty bad
jaundice no appetite complaining of muscular pains Same symptoms as
took the others The one this morning makes the fourth this month and
were only half through it

Are all your losses in this one station Kennon asked

Nobut its worst there

I dont like losses like that Alexander said

Neither do I Jordan replied

This isnt Jordans fault sir Blalok said quickly As you know we
havent had a vet for three months

Two Alexander corrected

ThreeOld Doc wasnt around at all the month before he died Blalok
said As a result weve got a problem We need professional help

Well here he isuse him Alexander said He looked at Kennon a trace
of amusement on his face Theres nothing like getting into things
early

Particularly when one comes into them stone cold Kennon added Its
a poor way to start a career

We cant afford to wait Jordan said We need help

Ill see what can be done Kennon replied Have you saved the body

Every one of them Jordan said Theyre in the hospital in the
autopsy room

That was sensible A postmortem might give us an answer Wheres the
hospital

Ill show you Jordan offered

Count me out Alexander said I have a weak stomach

Ill go along if its necessary Blalok said

Theres a staff there Old Doc trained them Jordan said

Then it shouldnt be necessary Kennon said

Blalok sighed with relief and turned to Alexander We could check the
records while those two are about their bloody work

Id rather check a long strong drink Alexander replied What with
the Family and this its too much to take for one evening

Kennon hid a smile Alexander had a weak spot He was squeamish That
was a good thing to know



CHAPTER VI

Jordan opened the door of the twostory building below Blaloks house
This is it he said just outside your front door Convenientno

Too convenient Kennon said also too quiet Isnt anyone on duty

I wouldnt know Old Doc never kept the place open at night

There was a stir of movement in the darkness the lights flashed on
and a sleepyeyed Lani blinked at them in the sudden glare She looked
blankly at Kennon and then brightened as she saw Jordan Whats the
trouble sir she asked

Nothing We want to look at the Lani I sent down this morningDr
Kennon would like to inspect the carcass

Youre the new doctor the Lani asked Thank goodness youve come
Ill get the staff Ill be back in a moment She stepped quickly over
to the switchboard beside the door and punched five buttons Four more
humanoids came into the room followed a little later by a fifth

Wheres the emergency one asked

He isits our new doctor

More females Kennon muttered to himself He turned to Jordan Arent
there any males in this crew

Jordan stared at him with mild surprise No sirdidnt you know
There are no male Lani

What

Just that Jordan said Only females There hasnt been a male on the
island since Old Man Alexander took over He killed them all

But thats impossible How do they reproduce

Ever hear of artificial fertilization

Surebut thats a dead end The offspring are haploids and theyre
sterile The line would die out in a generation

Not the Laniyou can see for yourself Weve been using the technique
here for better than four centuries and were still doing all right
Over forty generations so far and from the looks of things we can go on
indefinitely

But how is it done

I dont know Thats Alexanders secret The Bossman doesnt tell us
everything All I know is that we get results Old Doc knew how it was
done and I suppose you will too but dont ask me Im dumb

Kennon shrugged Maybemaybe not At any rate there was no sense in
belaboring the point He turned to the staff Five of them were the
same bigboned heavyframed type that apparently did most of the
manual labor The sixth the late arrival was an elegant creature a
bronzeskinned greeneyed minx with an elfin face half hidden under a
wavy mass of redbrown hair Unlike the others she had been dockedand
in contrast to their heavy eyes and sleeppuffed features she was alert
and lively She flashed him an impish grin revealing clean white teeth

Kennon smiled back He couldnt help it And suddenly the tension and
strangeness was broken He felt oddly at ease Which of you are on
duty he asked

All of us the redhead replied if its necessary What do you want
us to do

Hes already told me He wants that last carcass prepped for a
postmortem the nightcall Lani said

Good the redhead said Itll be nice to get to work again She
turned to face Kennon Now Doctorwould you like to see your office
Old Doc left a fine collection of notes on Lani anatomy and perhaps you
could do with a little review

I could do with a lot of it Kennon admitted Unless the inner
structure of a Lani is as similar to human as their outer

There are differences the redhead admitted After all we arent
quite alike

Perhaps Id better do some reading Kennon said

You need me any more Jordan asked

NoI think not

Good Ill get back Frankly I dont like this any better than Blalok
or the boss but Im low man on that pole See you later

Kennon chuckled as Jordan left Now lets get ready for that cadaver
he said

Carcass doctor the redhead corrected A cadaver is a dead human
body She accented the human

Even in death there is no equality Kennon thought He nodded and
the Lani led the way to a door which opened into a goodsized office
liberally covered with bookshelves An oldfashioned plastic desk some
office cybernetics a battered voicewriter and a few chairs completed
the furnishings The redhead placed several large folio volumes in front
of him and stepped back from the desk as he leafed rapidly through
the color plates It was an excellent atlas Dr Williamson had been a
careful and competent workman

Half an hour later well fortified with a positional knowledge of
Lani viscera Kennon looked up at the redhead She was still standing
patiently a statue of redgold and bronze

Get a smock and lets go he said Nowait a minute

Yes sir

Whats your name I dont want to say Hey you

She smiled Its Copper Glowwant my pedigree too

Noit wouldnt mean anything to me Do they call you Copper or Glow
or both

Just Copper sir

Very well Copperlets get going

  

The body of the dead Lani lay on the steel table waxy and yellowish in
the pitiless light of the fluorescents She had been hardly more than a
child Kennon felt a twinge of pityso youngso young to die And as
he looked he was conscious of another feeling

It had been an open secret among his classmates that he had refused
an offer to study human medicine because of his aversion to dissecting
cadavers The sarcoplastic models were all right but when it came to
flesh Kennon didnt have the stomach for it And now the sight of the
dead humanoid brought back the same cold sweat and gutwrenching nausea
that had caused him to turn to veterinary medicine eight years ago

He fought the spasms back as he approached the table and made the
external examination Icterus and a swollen abdomenthe rest was
essentially normal And he knew with cold certainty that he could not
lay a scalpel edge upon that cold flesh It was too human too like his
own

Are you ready Doctor the Lani standing across the table from him
asked Shall I expose the viscera

Kennons stomach froze Of course He should have realized No
pathologist did his own dissection He examined And that he could do
It was the tactile not the visual sensations that upset him He nodded
The abdominal viscera first he said

The Lani laid back the skin and musculature with bold sure strokes
An excellent prosectress Kennon thought Kennon pointed at the swollen
liver and the Lani deftly severed its attachments and laid the organ
out for inspection The cause of death was obvious The youngster had
succumbed to a massive liverfluke infestation It was the worst he
had ever seen The bile ducts were thick calcified and choked with
literally thousands of the graygreen leafshaped trematodes

Lets look at the others he said

Two more postmortems confirmed the diagnosis Except for minor
differences the lesions were identical He removed a few of the flukes
and set them aside for further study

Well thats that he said You can clean up now

He had found the criminal and now the problem assumed the fascinating
qualities of a crime hunt Now he must act to prevent further murders
to reconstruct the crime to find the modus operandi to track the fluke
to its source and to execute it before it could do more harm

Photographs and tridis would have to be taken the parasite would have
to be identified and its sensitivity to therapy determined Studies
would have to be made on its life cycle and the means by which it
gained entrance to its host It wouldnt be simple because this
trematode was probably Hepatodirus hominis and it was tricky It
adapted like the species it parasitized

Kennon leaned back from the microscope and studied the illustrations in
the parasitology text No matter how much Hepatodirus changed its life
cycle it could not change its adult form The arrangements of the
suckers and genital structures were typical Old Docs library on
parasites was too inadequate for more than diagnosis He would have to
wait for his own books to be uncrated before he could do more than apply
symptomatic treatment He sighed and rose slowly to his feet Tomorrow
was going to be a busy day

The door opened behind him and Copper slipped quietly into the office
She looked at him curiously a faint halfshy smile on her face

What is it Kennon asked

Are you ready to fill out the autopsy protocol Its customary

Its also customary to knock on a door before entering

Is it Old Doc never mentioned it

Im not Old Doc

No youre not she admitted Youre much youngerand far more
beautiful Old Doc was a fat gray old man She paused and eyed Kennon
appraisingly with a look on her pointed face that was the virtual twin
of Eloises I think Ill like working for you if youre as nice as you
are pretty

You dont call a man beautiful or pretty Kennon exploded

Why not

It just isnt done

Youre a funny human she said I called Old Doc beautiful and he
didnt mind

Thats different He was an old man

What difference does that make

I dont like it Kennon said hitting on the perfect answer

She stiffened Im sorry Doctor I wont do it again She looked down
at him head cocked sideways I guess I have a lot to learn about you
Youre much different from Old Doc He didnt snap at me She paused
for a moment then drew a deep breath

Kennon blinked

About that report she said Regulations require that each
postmortem be reported promptly and that a record of the Lani concerned
be posted in the death book together with all pertinent autopsy data
Man Blalok is very fussy about proper records She drew one of the
chairs to a spot beside the desk and sat down crossed her long legs
and waited expectantly

Kennons mouth was suddenly dry This situation was impossible How in
the name of Sir Arthur Fleming could he dictate a coldly precise report
with a naked redhead sitting beside him Look he said I wont need
you I can operate a voicewriter You can pick up the material later and
transcribe it

Her face fell You dont like me she said her green eyes filling
with quick tears Old Doc never

Oh damn Old Doc Kennon snapped And stop that snivelingor get
out Better yetget out and stop sniveling

She leaped to her feet and fled

Kennon swore There was no reason for him to act that way He had
been more brutal than necessary But the girlno the Laniwas
disconcerting He felt ashamed of himself He had behaved like a
primitive rather than a member of one of the oldest human civilizations
in the galaxy He wouldnt bark at a dog that way He shook his head
Probably he was tired Certainly he was irritable and unclad females
virtually indistinguishable from human werent the most soothing objects
to contemplate

He wondered if his exasperation was real or merely a defense mechanism
First Eloise and then this Confound it He was surrounded He felt
trapped And it wasnt because hed been away from women too long A
week was hardly that He grinned as he recalled the blonde from Thule
aboard the starship Now there was a woman even though her ears were
pointed and her arms were too long She didnt pressure a man She let
him make the advances

He grinned That was it He was on the defensive He was the one who was
being pursuedand his male ego had revolted He shrugged and turned
his attention to the autopsy report but it was hopeless He
couldnt concentrate He jotted a few notes and dropped them on the
desktomorrow would be time enough What he needed now was a stiff
drink and eight hours sleep



CHAPTER VII

Kennon stopped at Blaloks house long enough to tell the superintendent
what was causing the trouble Blalok scowled Weve never had flukes
here before he said Why should they appear now

Theyve been introduced Kennon said The thing that bothers me is
how Dr Williamson missed them

The old man was senile Blalok said He was nearly blind the last six
months of his life I wouldnt doubt that he let his assistants do most
of his work and they could have missed them

Possibly but the lesions are easy to see At any rate the culprit is
known now

Culprit

Hepatodirus hoministhe human liver fluke Hes a tricky little
fellowtravels almost as far as men do

Im glad its your problem not mine All I can remember about flukes
is that theyre hard to eradicate

Particularly H hominis

You can tell me about it later Right now Mr Alexanders over at
Oldyour house Probably hes looking for you

Wheres Jordan

He went up to Station Fourteen Well see him tomorrow

Ill say good night then Kennon said

Im glad youre here Its a load off my shoulders See you tomorrow
Blalok waved a friendly good night and left the lights on long enough
for Kennon to make his way to his quarters

Alexander was seated in a heavily upholstered chair listening to a taped
symphony in the stereo his eyes half closed an expression of peace
on his face An elderly Lani stood beside him It was a comfortable
picture

The humanoid saw Kennon and gasped a tiny indrawn sound of surprise
Alexanders eyes snapped open Ohits you he said Dont worry
Karaits your new doctor

Kara smiled You startled me she said I was dreaming

On your feet Alexander interjected idly

I should have known you at once Doctor Theres talk about you all
over the yards ever since you arrived

They know what is going on around here better than any of us
Alexander chuckled The grapevine is amazingly efficient Wellwhats
the story

Liver fluke

Hmmnot good

I think it can be stopped I looked at the records It doesnt seem to
have been here too long

I hope youre right How long will it take

Several months maybe a year maybe more I cant say But Ill try to
clean it up as quickly as possible Im pretty sure of the fluke and
its a hard one to control

Hepatodirus

Kennon nodded

Thats an offworld parasite isnt it

Yes It originated on Santos Parasitized the Varl originally but
liked humans better Its adapted to a hundred different planetary
environments and it keeps spreading Its a real cutiealmost
intelligent the way it behaves But it can be licked

Goodget on it right away

Im starting tomorrow

FineI thought youd be the right man Kara Fix the doctor a drink
We might as well have a nightcapthen Ill go back to the house and
listen to Henry and Annes screams about poor mistreated Douglas and
then back to Albertsville tomorrow Duty and the credits call

With mild surprise Kennon realized that Alexander was drunk Not
obnoxiously but enough to change his character Intoxicated he was a
friendlier person If there was any truth in the ancient cliche
about alcohol bringing out a mans true character then Alexander was
basically a very nice person indeed

Wellheres your home for the next five years Alexander said Eight
rooms two baths a freshener and three Lani to keep the place running
Youve got it made

Perhapswell see when we tackle this fluke infestation Personally I
dont think Im going to have an easy time Tomorrow Im going to be up
to my neck in trouble trying to save your profits

Youll do it I have confidence in you

I still think you should have hired a medic

This isnt all of your job Alexander said And besides I cant
afford to do it Ohnot the money but it might be admitting that the
Lani might be human And weve gone to a great deal of trouble to prove
theyre not He shifted uncomfortably in his chair Theres a story
behind this

I wouldnt doubt it

Maybe itd be better if I told it It goes back over four centuries
Grandfather was a clever man After he had secured this island he
became worried about the surviving Lani He didnt want to be accused
of genocide since the Lani were so human in appearance So he had his
medical officer make a few autopsies The MD reported that while there
was similarity the Lani were probably not human

That was enough for Grandfather He requested a Court of Inquiry The
court was sitting in Halsey and the hearing was private Even so it
leaked and Grandfather was highly unpopular for a time until the lab
reports came in It cost him over eight hundred Ems and nearly two
years time to finish the case but when it was over the Lani were
declared alien and Grandfather had ironclad discovery rights

They really put him through the mill Grandfather furnished the bodies
and three courtappointed MOs went through them with microscopes
They didnt miss a thing Their reports are so detailed that theyre
classics of their kind Theyre almost required reading for anyone
who wants to learn Lani structure and function The court rendered
an interim decision that the Lani were nonhuman and armed with this
Grandfather prepared the final tests which were run by a team of
courtappointed medics and biologists who made in vitro and live tests
on a number of Lani female prisoners The tests ran for over two years
and were totally negative So the Alexander family acquired Flora and
the Otpens and a legal status Alexander stood up Wellthats a
capsule summary The records are in the library if youd care to check
them

Why

Just to prove were honest He moved carefully toward the door opened
it and disappeared into the night

Silently Kennon watched him descend the porch steps He seemed steady
enough For a moment Kennon debated whether he should see him homeand
then decided against it If Alexander needed help hed have asked for
it As it was it was better to leave things alone Certainly he didnt
know Alexander well enough to act as a guardian He turned back to the
living area The stereo was playing something soft and nostalgic as
Kennon sank into the chair Alexander had vacated He let his body relax
It had been as full a day as he had ever spent filled with changes
so abrupt that they were exhausting He felt confused There were no
precedents he could apply Neither his studies nor his travels had
prepared him for living in a situation like this

Legally and biologically the Lani werent human But they were
intelligent upright bipedal mammals whose morphology was so close to
mans that it had taken the ultimate test to settle their status And
being a Betan Kennon was suspicious of the accuracy of that ultimate
test

But the Brotherhood of Man was based upon it The feeling of unity that
pervaded mankinds expanding empire was its product From almost the
beginning of mankinds leap to the stars it had been recognized that men
must help each other or perish The spirit of cooperation against the
common enmity of alien worlds and cultures transcended the old petty
rivalries on Earth Menall menwere brothers in arms

And so the Brotherhood was bornand the concept born of necessity
developed its muscles in a thousand battles on a thousand hostile
worlds And ultimately it evolved into the only form of central
authority that men would accept Yet basically it was not a government
It was an attitude of mind Men accepted its decisions as they would
accept the rulings of a family council and for the same reasons

The Brotherhood laid down certain rules but it did not attempt to
enforce them After all it didnt need to It also arbitrated disputes
admitted new worlds to membership and organized concerted human effort
against dangerous enemies And that was all Yet in its sphere the
authority of the Brotherhood was absolute


There was only one criterion for membership in the
Brotherhoodmembership in the human race No matter how decadent or
primitive a population might be if it was human it was automatically
eligible for Brotherhooda free and equal partner in the society of
human worlds

Kennon doubted that any nonhuman race had ever entered the select circle
of humanity although individuals might have done so A docked Lani for
instance would probably pass unquestioned as a human but the Lani race
would not In consequence they and their world were fair prey and had
been attacked and subjugated

Of course proof of inhumanity was seldom a problem Most alien life
forms were obviously alien But there were a fewlike the Laniwhere
similarities were so close that it was impossible to determine their
status on the basis of morphology alone And so the Humanity Test had
come into being

Essentially it was based upon species compatibilityon the concept that
like can interbreed with like Tests conducted on every inhabited world
in the Brotherhood had proven this conclusively Whatever changes had
taken place in the somatic characteristics of mankind since the Exodus
they had not altered the compatibility of human germ plasm Man could
interbreed with manaliens could not The test was simple The results
were observable And what was more important everyone could understand
it No definition of humanity could be more simple or direct

But was it accurate

Like other Betans Kennon wondered It wasso farprobably The
qualifying phrases were those of the scientist that strange breed that
refuses to accept anything as an established fact until it is proven
beyond a shadow of a doubt After all the human race had been
spaceborne for only six thousand yearsscarcely time for any real
differences to develop But physical changes had already appearedand
it would only be a question of time before these would probably be
followed by genetic changes And in some groups the changes might be
extensive enough to make them genetic strangers to the rest of humanity

What would happen then No one knew Actually no one bothered to think
about it except for a few farseeing men who worried as they saw

Probably

Might

Possibly

If

Four words But because of them the Betans were slowly withdrawing from
the rest of humanity Already the radiations of Betas variantG sun had
produced changes in the population Little things like tougher
epidermis and depilation of body hairlittle things that held alarming
implications to Betas scientists and to Betas people Not too many
generations hence a Betan outside his home system would be a rarity
and in a few millennia the Betan system itself would be a closed enclave
peopled by humans who had deviated too far from the basic stock to
mingle with it in safety

Of course the Brotherhood itself might be changed by that time but
there was no assurance that this would happen And mankind had a history
of dealing harshly with its mutants So Beta would play it safe

Kennon wondered if there were other worlds in the Brotherhood that had
come to the same conclusion Possibly there were And possibly there
were worlds where marked deviations had occurred There wasnt a year
that passed that didnt bring some new human world into the Brotherhood
and many of these had developed from that cultural explosion during the
First Millennium known as the Exodus where small groups of colonists in
inadequate ships set out for unannounced goals to homestead new worlds
for man Some of these survived and many were being discovered even
at this late date But so far none had any difficulty in proving their
human origin

The Lani conceivably could have been descendants of one of these
groups which probably explained the extreme care the Brotherhood
courts had taken with their case But they had failed the test and
were declared animals Yet it was possible that they had mutated beyond
genetic compatibility If they had and if it were proved here was a
test case that could rock the galaxythat could shake the Brotherhood
to its very foundationsthat could force a reevaluation of the
criteria of humanity

Kennon grinned He was a fine employee Here he was less than a full
day on the job dreaming how he could ruin his employer shake the
foundation of human civilization and force ten thousand billion humans
to change their comfortable habit patterns and their belief in the
unchangeable sameness of men He was he reflected wryly an incurable
romantic



CHAPTER VIII

Wake up Doctor its six AM A pleasant voice cut through Kennons
slumber He opened one eye and looked at the room For a moment the
strange surroundings bothered him then memory took over He stirred
uncomfortably looking for the owner of the voice

You have your morning calls at seven and theres a full day ahead
the voice went on Im sorry sir but you should get up The voice
didnt sound particularly sorry

It was behind him Kennon decided He rolled over with a groan of
protest and looked at his tormentor A gasp of dismay left his lips
for standing beside the bed a half smile on her pointed face was
Copperlooking fresh and alert and as disturbing as ever

It wasnt right Kennon thought bitterly to be awakened from a sound
sleep by a naked humanoid who looked too human for comfort What are
you doing here he demanded

Im supposed to be here Copper said Im your secretary She
grinned and flexed a few curves of her torso

Kennon was silent

Is there anything wrong she asked

For a moment Kennon was tempted to tell her what was wrongbut he held
his tongue She probably wouldnt understand But there was one thing
hed better settle right now Now look here young lady he began

Im not a lady Copper interrupted before he could continue Ladies
are human Im a Lani

All right Kennon growled Lani or human who cares But do you have
to break into a mans bedroom and wake him in the middle of the night

I didnt break in she said and it isnt the middle of the night
Its morning

All rightso its morning and you didnt break in Then how in
Halsteads sacred name did you get here


I sleep next door she said jerking a thumb in the direction of an
open door in the side wall Ive been there ever since you dismissed me
last night she explained

The explanation left Kennon cold The old cliche about doing as the
Santosians do flicked through his mind Well perhaps he would in
timebut not yet The habits of a lifetime couldnt be overturned
overnight Now you have awakened me he said perhaps youll get out
of here

Why

I want to get dressed

Ill help you

You will not Im perfectly capable of taking care of myself Ive been
dressing myself for years Im not used to people helping me

Mywhat a strange world you must come from Havent you ever had a
Lani before

No

You poor man Her voice was curiously pitying No one to make you
feel like the gods No one to serve you No one to even scrub your
back

Thats enough Kennon said I can scrub my own back

Howyou cant reach it

Kennon groaned

Werent there any Lani on your world

No

No wonder you left it It must be quite primitive

Primitive Kennons voice was outraged Beta has one of the highest
civilizations in the Brotherhood

But you dont have Lani she said patiently So you must be
primitive

Halstead Fleming and Ochsner Kennon swore Do you believe that

Naturally isnt it obvious You cant possibly be civilized unless you
take responsibility for intelligent life other than your own race
Until you face up to your responsibilities you are merely a member of a
dominant race not a civilized one

Kennons reply caught in his throat His eyes widened as he looked at
her and what he was about to say remained unspoken Out of the mouths
of humanoids he muttered oddly

What does that mean Copper asked

Forget it Kennon said wildly Leave me alone Go put on some
clothes You embarrass me

Ill go Copper said but youll have to be embarrassed Only
household Lani wear cloth She frowned two vertical furrows dividing
her dark brows Ive never understood why inhouse Lani have to be
disfigured that way but I suppose theres some reason for it Men
seldom do anything without a reason

Kennon shook his head Either she was grossly ignorant which he
doubted or she was conditioned to the eyeballs

The latter was more probable But even that was doubtful Her trenchant
remark about civilization wasnt the product of a conditioned mind But
why was he worrying about her attitudes They werent importantshe
wasnt even human He shook his head That was a sophistry The fact
that she wasnt human had nothing to do with the importance of her
attitude I suppose there is a reason he agreed But I dont know
it I havent been here long enough to know anything about such things

She nodded That does make a difference she admitted Many new
men are bothered at first by the fact that we Lani are naked but they
adjust quickly So will you She smiled as she turned away You see
she added over her shoulder as she left the room were not human
Were just another of your domestic animals

Was there laughter in her voice Kennon wasnt sure His sigh was
composed of equal parts of relief and exasperation as he slipped out of
bed and began to dress Hed forgo the shower this morning He had no
desire for Copper to appear and offer to scrub his back In his present
state of mind he couldnt take it Possibly hed get used to it in time
Perhaps he might even like it But right now he wasnt acclimatized

  

Man Blalok called Copper said as she removed the breakfast dishes
He said that hed be right over to pick you up He wants to show you
the operation When did he call

About ten minutes ago I told him that you were at breakfast He said
hed wait She disappeared in the direction of the kitchen

Theres a nightmare quality to this Kennon muttered as he slipped his
arms into the sleeves of his tunic and closed the seam tabs I have
the feeling that Im going to wake up any minute He looked at his
reflection in the dresser mirror and his reflection looked worriedly
back This whole thing has an air of plausible unreality the
advertisement the contract this impossible island that raises
humanoids as part of the livestock He shrugged and his mirrored image
shrugged back But its real all right No dream could possibly be
this detailed I wonder how Im going to take it for the next five
years Probably not too well he mused silently Already Im talking
to myself Without even trying that Lani Copper can make me feel like a
Sarkian He nodded at his image

The Sarkian analogy was almost perfect he decided For on that grimly
backward world females were as close to slaves as the Brotherhood would
permit raised from birth under an iron regimen designed to produce
complaisant mates for the dominant males Probably that was the reason
Sark was so backward The men having achieved domestic tranquillity
had no desire to do anything that would disturb the status quo And
since no Sarkian woman under any conceivable circumstances would annoy
her lordly master with demands to produce better mousetraps household
gadgetry and more money the technological development of Sark had come
to a virtual standstill It took two sexes to develop a civilization

Kennon shrugged Worlds developed as they did because people were as
they were and while passing judgment was still a major human pursuit
no native of one world had a right to force his customs down the
unwilling throat of another It would be better to accept his present
situation and live with it rather than trying to impose his Betan
conception of morality upon Lani that neither understood nor appreciated
it His business was to treat and prevent animal disease What happened
to the animals before infection or after recovery was none of his
affair That was a matter between Alexander and his conscience

Blalok was waiting for him sitting behind the wheel of a square boxy
vehicle that squatted with an air of unpolished efficiency on the
graveled drive behind his house He smiled a quick greeting as Kennon
approached Its about time you showed up he said Youll have to
get into the habit of rising early on this place We do most of our work
early in the morning and late in the afternoon During the day its too
hot to breathe let alone work Well lets get going Theres still
time to visit the outer stations

Kennon climbed in and Blalok started the vehicle I thought wed take a
jeep today he said They arent very pretty but they get around He
turned onto the surfaced road that ran down the hill toward the hospital
and the complex of redroofed buildings clustered about it About those
flukes he said You have any plans to get rid of them

Not yet Ill have to look the place over Theres more detective work
than medicine involved in this

Detective work

Surewe know the criminal but to squelch him we have to learn his
hangouts study his modus operandi and learn how to make his victims
secure from his activities Unless we do that we can treat individuals
from now to infinity and all well have is more cases We have to apply
modern criminology tacticseliminate the source of crimestop up the
soft spots In other words kill the flukes before they enter the Lani

Old Doc never said anything about this Blalok said

Probably he never knew about it I was looking over the herd books last
night and I saw nothing about trematodes or anything that looked like
a parasite pattern until the last few months

Why not

My guess is that he was one of the first deaths

You mean this thing attacks human beings

Preferentially Kennon said Its strange too because it originated
on Santos so far as we know In fact some people think that the Varl
bred it for a weapon to use against us before we conquered them They
could have done it Their biological science was of a high enough
order

But how did it get here

I wouldnt knowunless youve hired a Santosian or someone else who
was affected

We did have a man from Santos Fellow called Joe Kryla We had to let
him go because he was a nudist It made a bad impression on the Lani
But that was over a year ago

Thats about the right time to build up a good reservoir of infection
The fatal cases usually dont show up before an area is pretty well
seeded

Thats not so good

Well theres one thing in our favor The Lani are pretty well
concentrated into groups And so far there doesnt seem to be any
infestation outside of Hillside Stationexcept for two deaths in Lani
recently sent from there If we quarantine those stations and work fast
may be we can stop this before it spreads all over the island

Thats fine but what are you going to do now

Treat those that show symptoms There should be some Trematox capsules
at the hospital If there arent well get them Well take the
sick ones back to the hospital area and push therapy and supportive
treatment Now that we know the cause we shouldnt have any more death
losses

Old Doc didnt treat at the hospital Blalok said

Im not Old Doc

But its going to mess up our operations Were using the ward
buildings to finish training the Lani scheduled for market

Why

Its convenient Most of the ward space is filled right now Blalok
said There was a touch of disgust in his voice

Theyre well arent they Kennon demanded

Of course

Then get them out of there

But I told you

You told me nothing The hospital area is needed for something more
than a training center Perhaps Old Doc was trained in outcall work but
Im not I work from a hospital The only things I do on outcalls are
diagnoses vaccinations and emergencies The rest of the patients come
to the hospital

This isnt going to set well with Jordan and the division chiefs

Thats not my concern Kennon said I run my business in the best way
possible The patients are of more concern than the personal comfort of
any straw boss or administrator Youre the administratoryou calm them
down

You have the authority Blalok admitted But my advice to you is to
go slow

I cant Kennon said Not if we want to prevent any more losses
There simply wont be time to run all over the island dosing with
Trematox and taking temperatures and while that sort of thing is
routine it should be supervised Besides youll see the advantages of
this method Soon enough

I hope so Blalok said as he braked the jeep to a stop in front of the
hospital I suppose youll want to take some things along

So I will Kennon said Ill be back in a minute Kennon slid from
the seat leaving Blalok looking peculiarly at his departing back

The minute stretched to nearly ten before Kennon returned followed by
two Lani carrying bags which they loaded into the back of the jeep
I had to reorganize a little Kennon apologized some things were
unfamiliar

Plan on taking them Blalok said jerking a thumb at the two Lani

Not this time Im having them fit up an ambulance They should be busy
most of the day

Blalok grunted and started the turbine He moved a lever and the jeep
floated off the ground

An airboat too Kennon remarked I wondered why this rig was so
boxy

Its a multipurpose vehicle Blalok said We need them around here
for fast transport Most of the roads arent so good He engaged the
drive and the jeep began to move Well go cross country he said
Hillsides pretty far outthe farthest station since we abandoned
Olympus

The air began whistling past the boxlike body of the jeep as Blalok
increased the power to the drive and set the machine on automatic
Well get a pretty good crosssection of our operations on this trip
he said over the whine of the turbine Look down there

They were passing across a series of fenced pastures and Kennon was
impressed The size of this operation was beginning to sink in It
hadnt looked so big from the substratosphere in Alexanders ship but
down here close to the ground it was enormous Fields of grain wide
orchards extensive gardens Once they were forced to detour a huge
supply boat that rose heavily in front of them Working in the fields
were dozens of brownskinned Lani who paused to look up and wave as
the jeep sped by Occasional clusters of farm buildings and the low
barrackslike stations appeared and disappeared behind them

Theres about twenty Lani at each of these stations Blalok said
They work the farm area under the direction of the stationmaster

Hes a farmer

Of course Usually hes a graduate of an agricultural school but we
have a few who are descendants of the crew of the first Alexander and
theres one old codger who was actually with him during the conquest
Most of our stationmasters are family men We feel that a wife and
children add to a mans stabilityand incidentally keep him from
fooling around with the Lani

A series of fenced pastures containing hundreds of huge grayishwhite
quadrupeds slipped past

Cattle Kennon asked

YesEarth strain Thats why theyre so big We also have sheep and
swine but you wont see them on this run

Any native animals

A fewand some which are native to other worlds But theyre
luxurytrade items The big sale items are beef pork and mutton
Blalok chuckled Did you think that the Lani were our principal
export


Kennon nodded

Theyre only a drop in the bucket AgricultureEarthstyle
agricultureis our main source of income The Lani are valuable
principally to keep down the cost of overhead Virtually all of them
work right here on the island We dont sell more than a hundred a year
less than five per cent of our total And those are surplustoo light
or too delicate for farm work

Where do you find a market for all this produce Kennon asked

Theres two hundred million people here and quite a few billion more
in spacetrain range We can produce more cheaply than any competitor
and we can undersell any competition even full automation Blalok
chuckled There are some things that a computer cant do as well as
a human being and one of them is farm the foods on which humanity is
accustomed to feed A manll pay two credits for a steak He could get a
Chlorella substitute for half a credit but hell still buy the steak
if he can afford it Same thing goes for fruit vegetables grain and
garden truck Mans eating habits have only changed from necessity
Those who can pay will still pay well for natural foods Blalok
chuckled Weve put quite a dent in the algae and synthetics operations
in this sector

Its still a luxury trade Kennon said

Youve eaten synthetic Blalok replied What do you prefer

Kennon had to agree that Blalok was right He too liked the real thing
far better than its imitations

If its this profitable then why sell Lani Kennon asked

Its the Familys idea Actuallysince the export type is surplus it
does us no harm We keep enough for servantsand the others would be
inefficient for most farm work So disposal by sale is a logical and
profitable way of culling But now the Bossman is being pressured into
breeding an export type And this I dont like Its too commercial
Smells like slavery

Youre a Mystic arent you Kennon asked

Surebut that doesnt mean I like slavery Oh I know some of those
fatheaded Brotherhood economists call our system economic slaveryand
Ill admit that its pretty hard to crack out of a spherical trust
But that doesnt mean that we have to stay where we are Mystics arent
owned by their entrepreneurs Sure its a tough haul to beat the
boss but it can be done I did it and others do it all the time The
situation isnt hopeless

But it is with the Lani Kennon added

Of course Thats why they should be protected What chance does a
Lani have Without us they cant even keep going as a race Theyre
technological morons They dont live long enough to understand modern
civilization To turn those poor helpless humanoids out into human
society would be criminal Its our duty to protect them even while
were using them

Mans burden Kennon said repeating the old cliche

Exactly Blalok scowled I wish I had guts enough to give the
Bossman the factsbut I cant get nerve enough to try Ive a good job
herea wife and two kidsand I dont want to jeopardize my future
Blalok glanced over the side Well here we are he said and began
descending into the center of a spokelike mass of buildings radiating
outward from a central hub

Hmmbig place Kennon murmured

It should be Blalok replied It furnishes all of our Lani for
replacement and export It can turn out over a thousand a year at
full capacity Of course we dont run at that rate or Flora would be
overpopulated But this is a big layout like you said It can maintain
a population of at least forty thousand Old Alexander had big ideas

I wonder what he planned to do with them Kennon said

I wouldnt know The Old Man never took anyone into his confidence

Jordan came up as the jeep settled to the ground Been expecting you
for the past half hour he said Your office said you were on your
wayGood to see you too Doc Ive been going over the records with
Hank Allworththe stationmaster here Jordan held out his hand

Youre an Earthman eh Kennon asked as he grasped the outstretched
hand The gesture was as old as man its ritualistic meaning lost in
antiquity

NoMarsborna neighbor world Jordan said But our customs and
Earths are the same

Youre a long way from home Kennon said

No farther than you Doc Jordan looked uncomfortable But we can
compare origins later Right now youd better come into the office
Ive run across something peculiar



CHAPTER IX

There are twelve bays to this station Jordan said Under our present
setup two are used for breeding and the other ten for maturation We
rotate the youngsters around the baya different bay each year until
theyre age eleven Then theyre sorted according to type and sent out
for a year of further specialized training after which they go onto the
farms or to inhouse or export

Now heres the peculiar part Theres no trouble in Bays One through
Nine but Bay Ten has had all our losses except two that have occurred
at the training stations

Thats good news Kennon said Our parasite cant have had time to
migrate too far We have him pinpointed unlesssay how many training
centers are there

Three Jordan said

Quarantine them Kennon replied Right now Nothing goes in or out
until weve checked them and completed prophylaxis

Jordan looked at Blalok inquiringly

Hes the boss Blalok said Do as youre told This is his problem

Why the quarantine Jordan asked

I want to get any carriers We can check them with antigen and then
give Trematox

All that concentration in Bay Ten Jordan said Does it mean
something

Blalok said that there was a Santosian in your division

YeahJoe Krylaand come to think of it he ran Bay Ten

Thats a helpnow lets see what makes that bay different from the
others

Why

Ill tell youbut you may not understand Kennon said

Ill take a chance

Kennon grinned All right you asked for it The parasite thats doing
the damage is a flatworm a trematode called Hepatodirus hominis As
Ive told Blalok its a tricky thing Like all trematodes it has a
threestage life cycle but unlike every other fluke its life cycle is
not fixed to definite intermediate hosts Depending upon where it is
the fluke adapts It still must pass through its life cycle but its
intermediate host need not be one species of snail fish or copepod
Any coldblooded host will do What you have here is a Kardonian variant
which has adapted to some particular intermediate host on this world
Until now its final host was either man or Varl Now we have a third
the Lani And apparently they are the most susceptible of the three
It never kills Varl And humans while theyre more susceptible only
occasionally succumb but the Lani appear to be the most susceptible of
all Ive never seen an infestation like those Lani had Their livers
were literally crawling with flukes Kennon paused and looked at
Jordan You following me he asked

Slowly and poorly Jordan said Youre assuming too much knowledge on
my part

Kennon chuckled You cant say I didnt warn you

WellIm really interested in only one thinghow do you break the
parasite up in business

Theres only one sure wayand thats to break the life cycle The
technique is thousands of years old but its just as good today as it
was then

Goodthen lets do it

To make a varrit stew Kennon said one must first catch the varrit

Huh

We have to learn the beasties life cycle before we can break it
and like I said it adapts Its intermediate host can be any one of a
hundred coldblooded animals

Is there no place else where it can be attacked

Sure in the body of the final host or on its final encysting place
But that wont eliminate the bug

Why not

Itll still survive in its infective form and enough Lani will get
subacute dosage to propagate it until the time is right for another
epizootic We have to kill its intermediate hostor hosts if it has
more than one That will keep it from growing and will ultimately
eradicate it

Judson scratched his head It sounds complicated

It is Its so complicated that once the fluke becomes well established
its virtually impossible to eradicate

And you think it can be done here

We can give it the old college try But its going to take some
detective work

Where do we start

With Bay Ten We look it over real well Then we check the diet and
habits of the Lani Then we check each individual Lani Then we check
the life cycle of the parasite Somewhere along the line if were lucky
well find a weak point that can be attacked

Thats a big order Blalok said

It cant be helped Thats the way it is Of course were lucky that
were on an isolated land mass That gives us an advantage We should be
able to clean this up

How long do you think it will take

It depends on how well the fluke is established Six months at the
minimumand I wouldnt care to guess at the maximum However I hope
the minimum will be time enough

So do I Blalok said

Well Kennon said lets get on with it

I hope it wont interrupt our program Jordan said

Of course it will interrupt it Kennon replied It cant help it Get
the idea in your head that youre facing something here that can cripple
youmaybe abort your whole operation You have a choiceinterrupt now
or abort later And half measures wont work To eradicate this pest
requires an allout effort

But I cant see why we cant merely bypass Bay Ten Jordan said

Take my word for it Kennon said You cant Theres no accurate way
of telling how far this spreads until the death losses occur Our tests
for fluke infestation arent that good We have to work thoroughly and
carefully We cant be butting heads over thiseither we all cooperate
or this whole operation will blow up in our faces

Look at the record Six months ago you ended a year with no deaths from
disease Five months ago Old Doc and two Lani were ill Four months ago
one of the two Lani was dead and Old Doc was too ill to be effective
Three months ago Old Doc and the other Lani were dead and before the
end of the month two more followed them Two months ago six died last
month eight and so far this month youve lost four and you have over
two weeks to go Up to now theyve all been from here but two this
month were at other stations In six months if nothing is done well
be having losses there unless were lucky And the losses will keep
on increasing Apparently you dont know what it is to live with
parasitesso let me tell you It isnt pleasant

Blalok shrugged You neednt get hot about it he said After all
youre the Docand well cooperate

Jordan nodded We will he said All the way



CHAPTER X

There is a special providence that looks over recent veterinary
graduates Kennon reflected as he checked the monthly reports from the
Stations Since the time he had laid down the law to Judson and Blalok
he had had no trouble from the production staff And for the past four
months there had been no further trouble with Hepatodirus That unwanted
visitor had apparently been evicted At that they had been lucky The
parasite had been concentrated at Hillside Station and had failed to
establish itself in the training area The intermediate host it had
turned out was a small amphibian that was susceptible to commercial
insecticide It had been no trouble to eradicate Systemic treatment and
cooking of all food had cleaned up the infective cercaria and individual
infections and after six months of intensive search quarantine and
investigation Kennon was morally certain that the disease had been
eradicated The last four reports confirmed his belief

He sighed as he leaned back in his chair Blalok was at last convinced
that his ideas were right The hospital was operating as a hospital
should with a staff of twelve Lani kept busy checking the full wards
Actually it was working better than it should since stationmasters all
over the island were now shipping in sick animals rather than treating
them or requesting outpatient service

Hi Doc Blalok said as he pushed the door open and looked into the
office You doing anything

Not at the moment Kennon said Something troubling you

Nojust thought Id drop in for a moment and congratulate you

For what

For surviving the first year

That wont be for two months yet

Blalok shook his head This is Kardon he said Theres only three
hundred and two days in our year ten thirtyday months and two special
days at the years end

Kennon shrugged My contract is Galactic Standard I still have two
months to go But how come the tenmonth year Most other planets have
twelve regardless of the number of days

Old Alexander liked thirtyday months

Ive wondered about that

Youll find a lot more peculiar things about Flora when you get to know
her better This year has just been a breakingin period

Kennon chuckled Its damn near broken me he admitted You know I
thought that the Lanid be my principal practice when I came here

You didnt figure that right Theyre the easiest part Theyre
intelligent and cooperative

Which is more than one can say about the others Kennon wiped the
sweat from his face What with this infernal heat and their eternal
stubbornness Ive nearly been driven crazy

You shouldnt have laid out that vaccination program

I had to Your hog business was living mostly on luck and the sheep
and shrakes were almost as bad You cant get away from soil saprophytes
no matter how clean you are Under a pasture setup theres always
a chance of contamination And that old cliche about an ounce of
prevention is truer of livestock raising than anything else I can think
of

I have some more good news for you Blalok said Thats why I came
over Were going to have another species to treat and vaccinate

Kennon groaned Now what

Poultry Blaloks voice was disgusted Personally I think its a
mess but Alexander thinks its profitable Someones told him that
pound for pound chickens are the most efficient feed converters of all
the domestic animals So were getting a pilot plant eggs incubator
and a knockeddown broiler battery so we can try the idea out
The Bossman is always hot on new ideas to increase efficiency and
production The only trouble is that he fails to consider the work
involved in setting up another operation

Youre so right Ill have to brush up on pullorum ornithosis
coccidosis leukosis perosis and Ochsner knows how many otherosises
anditises I was never too strong on fowl practice in school and Id
be happier if I never had anything to do with them

So would I Blalok agreed I cant see anything in this but trouble

Kennon nodded

And hes forgotten something else Blalok added Poultry need
concentrated feed Were going to have to install a feed mill

Kennon chuckled I hope hell appreciate the bill he gets

He thinks we can use local labor Blalok said gloomily I wish hed
realize that Lani are technological morons

They could learn

I suppose sobut it isnt easy And besides Allworth is the only man
with feedmill experience and hes up to his ears with Hillside Station
since that expansion order came in

I never did get the reason for that After we complained about the
slavery implications and got the Bossmans okay to hold the line why
do we need more Lani

Didnt you know His sisters finally decided to try marriage Found
herself some overmuscled Halsite who looked good to herbut she
couldnt crack his moral barrier Blalok grinned I thought youd be
the first to know Wasnt she interested in you

Kennon chuckled You could call it that Interestedlike the way a
dogs interested in a beefsteak Its a good thing we had that fluke
problem or Id have been chewed up and digested long ago That woman
frightens me

I could be scared by uglier things Blalok said With the Bossmans
sister on my side I wouldnt worry

What makes you think shed be on my side Shes a cannibal

Well you know her better than I do

He didhe certainly did That first month had been one of the worst he
had ever spent Kennon reflected Between Eloise and the flukes he had
nearly collapsedand when it had come to the final showdown he thought
for a while that hed be looking for another job But Alexander had been
more than passably understanding and had refused his sisters passionate
pleas for a Betan scalp He owed a debt of gratitude to the Bossman

Youre lucky you never knew her Kennon said

That all depends on what you mean Blalok said as he grinned and
walked to the door The parting shot missed its mark entirely as Kennon
looked at him with blank incomprehension You should have been a
Mystic Blalok said A knowledge of the sacred books would do you no
end of good And with that cryptic remark the superintendent vanished

That had all the elements of a snide remark Kennon murmured to
himself but my educations been neglected somewhere along the line I
dont get it He shrugged and buzzed for Copper The veterinary report
would have to be added to the pile already before him and the Bossman
liked to have his reports on time

Copper watched Kennon as he dictated the covering letter her slim
fingers dancing over the stenotype He had been here a full yearbut
instead of becoming a familiar object he had grown so gigantic that
he filled her world And it wasnt merely because he was young and
beautiful He was kind too

Yet she couldnt approach him and she wanted to so desperately that
it was a physical pain Other Lani had told her about men and what they
could do Even her old preceptress at Hillside Station had given her
some advice when Man Allworth had tattooed the tiny V on her thigh that
meant she had been selected for the veterinary staff And when Old Doc
had brought her from the Training Station to the hospital and removed
her tail she was certain that she was one of the lucky ones who would
know love

But love wasnt a pain in the chest an ache in the belly and thighs an
unfulfilled longing that destroyed sleep and made food tasteless Love
was supposed to be pleasant and exciting She could remember every word
her preceptress had spoken

My little one the old Lani had said you now wear the doctors mark
And soon no one will be able to tell you from a human You will look
like our masters You will share in their work And there may be times
when you will find favor in their eyes Then you may learn of love

Love the old voice was soft in Coppers ears The word is almost a
stranger to us now known only to the few who serve our masters It was
not always so The Old Ones knew love before Man Alexander came And
our young were the fruit of love rather than the product of our masters
cunning But you may know the flower even though you cannot bear its
fruit You may enter that world of pleasurepain the Old Ones knew that
world which is now denied us

But remember always that you are a Lani A man may be kind to you He
may treat you gently He may show you love Yet you never will be his
equal Nor must you become too attached to him for you are not human
You are not his natural mate You cannot bear his young You cannot
completely share You can only accept

So if love should come to you take it and enjoy it but do not try to
possess it For there lies heartache rather than happiness And it is
a world of heartache my little one to long for something which you
cannot have

To long for something which one cannot have Copper knew that feeling
It had been with her ever since Kennon had come into her life that
night a year ago And it had grown until it had become gigantic He
was kindyes He was harshoccasionally Yet he had shown her no more
affection than he would have shown a dog Lessfor he would have petted
a dog and he did not touch her

He laughed but she was not a part of his laughter He needed her but
the need was that of a builder for a tool He liked her and sometimes
shared his problems and triumphs with her and sometimes his defeats
but he did not love There had never been for her the bright fierce look
he had bent upon the Woman Eloise those times when she had come to him
the look men gave to those who found favor in their eyes

Had he looked at her but once with that expression she would have come
to him though fire barred the way The Woman Eloise was a fool

Copper looked at him across the corner of the desk the yellow hair the
bronze skin firm chin soft lips and long straight nose the
narrowed eyes hooded beneath thick brows scanning the papers in his
leantendoned hands His nearness was an ache in her bodyyet he was
far away

She thought of how his hands would feel upon her He had touched her
once and that touch had burned like hot iron For hours she had felt
it He looked up Her heart choked her with its beating She would die
for him if he would but once run his fingers over her tingling skin and
stroke her hair

The naked emotion in Coppers face was readable enough Kennon thought
One didnt need Sorovkin techniques to interpret what was in her mind
And it would have been amusing if it werent so sad For what she
wanted he couldnt give Yet if she were human it would be easy A
hundred generations of Betan moral code said never yet when he looked
at her their voices faded He was a mana member of the ruling race
She was an animala beasta humanoidnear human but not near enough
To like her was easybut to love her was impossible It would be
bestiality Yet his body less discerning than his mind responded to
her nearness

He sighed It was a pleasant unpleasantness a mixed emotion he could
not analyze In a way it was poetrythe fierce vaguely disquieting
poetry of the sensual Santosian bardsthe lyrics that sung of the joys
of flesh He had never really liked them yet they filled him with a
vague longing an odd uneasinessjust the sort that filled him now
There was a deadly parallel here He sighed

Yes sir Do you want something Copper asked

I could use a cup of coffee he said These reports are getting me
down The banality amused himsitting here thinking of Copper and
talking about coffee Banality was at once the curse and the saving
grace of mankind It kept men from the emotional peaks and valleys that
could destroy them He chuckled shakily The only alternative would be
to get rid of herand he couldnt or wouldntthe question intruded
slyly do that

Copper returned with a steaming cup which she set before him Truly
this coffee was a mans drink She had tried it once but the hot
bitterness scalded her mouth and flooded her body with its heat And she
had felt so lightheaded Not like herself at all It wasnt a drink for
Lani Of that she was certain

Yet he enjoyed it He looked at her and smiled He was pleased with
her Perhapsyetshe might find favor in his eyes The hope was always
there within hera hope that was at once fear and prayer And if she
didshe would know what to do

Kennon looked up Coppers face was convulsed with a bright mixture of
hope and pain Never he swore had he saw anything more beautiful or
sad Involuntarily he placed his hand upon her arm She flinched her
muscles tensing under his finger tips It was though his fingers carried
a galvanic current that backlashed up his arm even as it stiffened hers

Whats the matter Copper he asked softly

Nothing Doctor Im just upset

Why

There it was again the calm friendly curiosity that was worse than a
bath in ice water Her heart sank She shivered She would never find
her desire here He was coldcoldcold He wouldnt see He didnt
care All rightso that was how it had to be But first she would tell
him Then he could do with her as he wished I hopedfor the past year
that you would see me That you would think of me not as a Lani but as
a beloved The words came faster now tumbling over one another That
you would desire me and take me to those worlds we cannot know unless
you humans show us I have hoped so much but I suppose its wrongfor
youyou are so very human and Iwell Im not The last three words
held all the sadness and the longing of mankind aspiring to be God

My dearmy poor child Kennon murmured

She looked at him but her eyes could not focus on his face for his
hands were on her shoulders and the nearness of him drove the breath
from her body From a distance she heard a hard tight voice that was her
own Oh siroh please sir

The hands withdrew leaving emptinessbut her heartbeat slowed and the
pink haze cleared and she could see his face

And with a surge of terror and triumph she realized what she saw That
hard bright look that encompassed and possessed her The curved lips
drawn over white white teeth The flared nostrils The hungry demand
upon his face that answered the demand in her heart And she knewat
lastwith a knowledge that turned her limbs to water that she had
found favor in his eyes



CHAPTER XI

Mixed emotion Ha The author of that cliche didnt even know its
meaning Kennon strode furiously down the dusty road toward Station One
trying to sublimate his inner conflict into action It was useless of
course for once he stopped moving the grim tugofwar between training
and desire would begin again and no matter how it ended the result
would be unsatisfactory As long as he had been able to delude himself
that he was fond of Copper the way a man is fond of some lesser species
it had been all right But he knew now that he was fond of her as a man
is of a womanand it was hell For no rationalization in the universe
would allow him to define her as human Copper was humanoidsomething
like human And to live with her and love her would not be
miscegenation which was bad enough but bestiality which was a thousand
times worse

Although throughout most of the Brotherhood miscegenation was an unknown
word and even bestiality had become a loose definition on many worlds
with humanoid populations the words had definite meaning and moral
force to a Betan AndGod help himhe was a Betan A lifetime of
training in a moral code that frowned upon mixed marriages and shrank
appalled from even the thought of mixing species was nothing to bring
face to face with the fact that he loved Copper

It was odd Kennon reflected bitterly that humans could do with animals
what their customs and codes prohibited them from doing to themselves
For thousands of yearsback to the very dawn of history when men had
bred horses and asses to produce mulesmen had been mixing species
to produce useful hybrids Yet a Betan who could hybridize plants or
animals with complete equanimity shrank with horror from the thought of
applying the same technique to himself

What was there about a human being that was so sacrosanct He shook his
head angrily He didnt know There was no answer But the ideathe
beliefwas there ingrained into his attitudes a part of his outlook
built carefully block by block from infancy until it now towered into a
mighty wall that barred him from doing what he wished to do

It would be an easier hurdle if he had been born anywhere except on
Beta In the rest of the Brotherhood the color of a mans skin the
shape of his face the quality and color of his hair and eyes made no
difference All men were brothers But on Beta where a variantG sun
had already caused genetic divergence the brotherhood of man was a term
that was merely given lip service Betans were different and from birth
they were taught to accept the difference and to live with it Mixing of
Betan stock with other human species while not actually forbidden was
so encircled with conditioning that it was a rare Betan indeed who would
risk selfopprobrium and the contempt of his fellows to mate with an
outsider And as for humanoidsKennon shuddered He couldnt break the
attitudes of a lifetime Yet he loved Copper

And she knew he did

And that was an even greater horror He had fled from the office from
the glad light in her eyes as a burned child flees fire He needed time
to think time to plan Yet his body and his surface thoughts wanted no
plans or time Living with a Lani wasnt frowned upon on Flora Many of
the staff did nor did anyone seem to think less of them for doing
so Even Alexander himself had halfconfessed to a more than platonic
affection for a Lani called Susy

Yet this was no excuse nor would it silence the cold still voice in his
mind that kept repeating sodomitesodomitesodomite with a passionless
inflection that was even more terrible than anger

The five kilometers to Station One disappeared unnoticed beneath his
feet as he walked and he looked up in surprise to see the white walls
and red roofs of the station looming before him

Good Lord Doc Whats got into you the stationmaster said You
look like youd seen a ghost And out in this sun without a helmet Come
inside man before you get sunstroke

Kennon chuckled without humor Getting sunstroke is the least of my
worries Al he said but he allowed Al Crothers to usher him inside

Its odd that you showed up right now Al said his dark face showing
the curiosity that filled him I just had a call from Message Center
not five minutes ago telling me to have you call in if you showed up


Kennon sighed On this island you cant get away from the phone he
said wryly OK where is it

You look pretty bushed Doc Maybe youd better rest awhile

And maybe its an emergency Kennon interrupted And probably it is
because the staff can handle routine mattersso maybe youd better show
me where you keep the phone

  

One moment please the Message Center operator said There were a few
clicks in the background Heres your party she continued Go ahead
Doctor

Kennon a nervous voice crackled from the receiver

Yes

Youre needed out on Otpen One

Who is callingand whats the rush

DouglasDouglas Alexander The Lani are dying Its an emergency
Cousin Alexll skin us alive if we let these Lani die

Douglas Kennon hadnt thought of him since the one time they had met
in Alexandria That was a year ago It seemed much longer Since the
Bossman had exiled his cousin to that bleak rock to the east of Flora
there had been no word of him And nowhe laughed a sharp bark of
humorless annoyanceDouglas couldnt have timed it better if he had
tried

All right Kennon said Ill come What seems to be the trouble

Theyre sick

Thats obvious Kennon snapped Otherwise you wouldnt be calling
Cant you tell me any more than that

Theyre vomiting They have diarrhea Several have had fits

Thanks Kennon said Ill be right out Expect me in an hour

So youre leaving Al asked as he cradled the phone

Thats a practitioners life Kennon said Full of interruptions Can
I borrow your jeep

Ill drive you Where do you want to go

To the hospital Kennon said Ill have to pick up my gear Its an
emergency all right

Youre a tough one Al said admiringly Id hate to walk five kilos
in this heat without a hatand then go out on a call

Kennon shrugged Its not necessarily toughness I believe in doing one
job at a timeand my contract reads veterinary service not personal
problems The job comes first and theres work to do

Copper wasnt in sight when Kennon came back to the hospitala fact for
which he was grateful He packed quickly threw his bags into the jeep
and took off with almost guilty haste Hed contact the Hospital from
the Otpens Right now all he wanted was to put distance between himself
and Copper Absence might make the heart grow fonder but at the moment
propinquity was by far the more dangerous thing He pointed the blunt
nose of the jeep toward Mount Olympus set the autopilot opened the
throttle and relaxed as best he could as the little vehicle sped at top
speed for the outer islands A vague curiosity filled him Hed never
been on the Otpens He wondered what they were like

  

Otpen One was a rocky treeclad islet crowned with the stellate mass of
a Class II Fortalice But this one wasnt like Alexandria It was fully
manned and in service condition

Airboat a voice crackled from the dashboard speaker of the jeep
Identify yourself You are being tracked

Kennon quickly flipped the IFF switch Dr Kennon from Flora he
said

Thank you sir You are expected and are clear to land Bring your
vehicle down in the marked area A section of the roof turned a garish
yellow as Kennon circled the building He brought the jeep in lightly
setting it carefully in the center of the area

Leave your vehicle the speaker chattered If you are armed leave
your weapon behind

Its not my habit to carry a gun Kennon snapped

Sorry sirregulations the speaker said This is SOP

Kennon left the jeep and instantly felt the probing tingle of a search
beam He looked around curiously at the flat roof of the fortress
with its domed turrets and ugly snouts of the main battery projectors
pointing skyward Beside him the long metal doors of a missile launcher
made a rectangular trace on the smooth surface of the roof Behind him
the central tower poked its gaunt ferromorph and durilium outline into
the darkening sky bearing its crown of spiderweb radar antennae turning
steadily on their gimbals covering a vast hemisphere from horizon to
zenith with endless inspection

From the base of the tower a man emerged He was tall taller even than
Kennon and the muscles of his body showed through the tightness of
his battle dress His face was harsh and in his hands he carried a
Burkholtz magnumthe most powerful portable weapon mankind had yet
devised

You are Dr Kennon the trooper asked

I am

Your ID please

Kennon handed it over and the big man scanned the card with practiced
eyes Check he said Follow me sir

My bags Kennon said

Theyll be taken care of

Kennon shrugged and followed the man into the tower A modern gravshaft
lowered them to the ground floor They passed through a gloomy
caricature of the Great Hall in Alexandria through an iris and down a
long corridor lined with doors

A bell rang

Back the trooper said Against the wall Quick Into the doorway

Whats up

Another practice alert The troopers voice was bored It gets so
that youd almost wish for a fight to relieve the monotony

A trooper and several Lani came down the corridor running in
disciplined formation Steel clanged on steel as they turned the corner
and moments later the whine of servos came faintly to their ears From
somewhere deep in the pile a rising crescendo of generators under full
battle load sent out vibrations that could be sensed rather than heard
A klaxon squawked briefly There was another clash of metal and a harsh
voice boomed through the corridors Fourteen seconds Well done Secure
stations

The trooper grinned That ties the record he said We can go now

The corridor ended abruptly at an iris flanked by two sentries They
conferred briefly with Kennons guide dilated the iris and motioned
for Kennon to enter The pastel interior of the modern office was a
shocking contrast to the gray ferromorph corridors outside

Douglas Alexander was standing behind the desk He was much the same
His pudgy face was haggard with uncertainty and his eyes darted back
and forth as his fingers caressed the knobby grip of a small Burkholtz
jutting from a holster at his waist There were new unpleasant furrows
between his eyes He looked older and the indefinable air of cruelty was
more pronounced He had been frightened the last time Kennon had seen
him and he was frightened now

Im not sure whether I am glad to see you Kennon he said
uncertainly But I suppose I have to be

Kennon believed him

How have you been Kennon asked

Not too bad until this afternoon Things have been going pretty well
He shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another I suppose Cousin
Alex will skin me for this but theres nothing else I can do He
licked his lips Youve been here long enoughand youll have to know
eventually He fidgeted and finally sat down behind the desk We
have trouble Half the Lani were stricken about four hours ago It was
sudden No warning at all And if they die his voice trailed off

Wellwhat are we waiting for Get someone to bring my bags down here
and well look them over

Do you have toCant you prescribe something

How I havent examined the patients

I can tell you whats wrong

Kennon smiled I hardly think thats the way to do it Even though
your description might be accurate you still might miss something of
critical importance

Douglas sighed I thought thats what youd say he said Ohvery
wellyou might as well see what we have out here

You cant possibly believe that I dont already know Kennon said
You have male Lani

Douglas looked at him his face blank with surprise Buthow did you
know No one on the main island does except the Family And we never
talk about it Did Eloise tell you I noticed she was struck with you
the day you came and the Lani who have come out here since have been
talking about you two Did she do it

Kennon shook his head She never said a word

Then how

Im not stupid Kennon said That story youve spread about
artificial fertilization has more holes in it than a sieve That
technique has been investigated a thousand times And it has never
worked past the first generation If you had been using it the Lani
would long ago have been extinct Haploids dont reproduce and the only
way the diploid number of chromosomes can be kept is to replace those
lost by maturation division of the ovum You might be able to keep the
diploid number by using immature ova but the fertilization technique
would be far more complex than the simple uterine injections you use at
Hillside Station

Douglas looked at him blankly

Besides Kennon added I have a microscope I checked your socalled
fertilizing solution I found spermatozoa and spermatozoa only come
from males Whats more the males have to be the same species as the
females or fertilization will not take place So there must be male
Lani Nothing else fits Youve been using artificial insemination
on the mainisland Lani And from the way this place is guarded its
obvious that here is your stud farm

Douglas shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture of resignation I
suppose he said thats the way Old Doc found out too We never told
him but he knew before he ever came out here

The only thing that puzzles me Kennon went on is how you managed to
eliminate the Ychromosome carriers within the sperm

Eh

The male sexdeterminant Half the sperm carry it but so far as I
know theres never been a male born on the main island

Ohthat Its something thats done in the labs here Probably one of
the technicians could tell you Its called electroelectro freezing
or something like that

Electrodiaphoresis

Douglas nodded That sounds like it I dont know anything about
it One of Grandfathers men did the basic work We just follow
instructions He shrugged Wellsince you know the secret theres no
sense in hiding the bodies Come along and tell me whats wrong

It was a peculiar feeling to walk down the row of cubical rooms with
their barred doors The whole area reminded him of a historical novel
of the prisons of early human history where men confined other men for
infractions of social customs The grimness of the place was appalling
The male Laniimpressive in their physical developmentwere in
miserable condition nauseated greenfaced retching The sickening
odors of vomit and diarrhea hung heavily on the air Douglas coughed and
held a square of cloth to his face and even Kennon strongstomached
as he was could feel his viscera twitch in sympathy with the caged
sufferers

Great Fleming man Kennon exploded You cant keep them here Get
them out Give them some fresh air This place would make a well man
sick

Douglas looked at him I wouldnt take one of them out unless I had him
shackled and there was an armed guard to help me Those males are the
most vicious cunning and dangerous animals on Kardon They exist with
but one thought in mindto kill

Kennon looked curiously through a barred door at one of the Lani He lay
on a bare cot a magnificently muscled figure with a ragged black beard
hiding his face There were dozens of scars on his body and one angry
purple area on his thick right forearm where flesh had been torn away
not too long ago Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and soft
moaning noises came from his tight lips as he pressed his abdomen with
thickfingered hands He doesnt look so dangerous Kennon said

Watch it Douglas warned Dont get too close But the warning was
too late Kennon touched the bars and as he did the Lani moved with
fluid speed one huge hand clutching Kennons sleeve and pulling him
against the bars while the other darted for his throat Fingers bit
into Kennons neck and tightened in a viselike grip Kennon reacted
automatically His arms came up inside the Lanis and crashed down
elbows out tearing the Lani loose He jumped back rubbing his bruised
throat That fellows not sick he gasped Hes crazy

The Lani glared at him through the bars disappointment written on his
scarred and bearded face

I warned you Douglas said His voice held an undertone of malicious
laughter He must be sick or he would have killed you George is clever
in a stupid sort of way

Kennon looked into the cubicle The Lani glared back and growled There
was a beastlike note in his voice that made the short hairs on Kennons
neck prickle

That fellow needs a lesson he said

You want to give it to him Douglas asked

Not particularly

Hamanyou afraid the Lani taunted His voice was thick and
harsh All men fear me All Lani too I am boss Come close again man
and I kill you

Are they all that stupid Kennon asked He sounds like a homicidal
moron

Hes not stupid Douglas said Just uneducated

Why is he so murderous

Thats his training All his life he has fought From childhood his
life has been based on his ability to survive in an environment where
every male is his enemy You see here the sublimation of individuality
He cannot cooperate with another male He hates them and they in turn
hate him George here is a perfect example of absolute freedom from
restraint Douglas smiled unpleasantly

His whole history is one of complete lack of control As an infant
being a male his mother thought she was favored by the gods and she
denied him nothing In fact we were quite insistent that she gave him
everything he wanted By the time he was able to walk and take care of
himself he was completely spoiled selfish and authoritative

Then we took him and a dozen others exactly like him and put them
together Douglas grinned You should see what happens when a dozen
spoiled brats are forced to live together Its more fun The little
beasts hate each other on sight And we stimulate them to compete for
toys food and drink Never quite enough to go around You can imagine
what happens Instead of sharing each little selfish individualist
fights to get everything he can grab Except for one thing we
dont punish them no matter what they do If anyone shows signs of
cooperating he is disciplined severely the first time The next time
he is culled But other than that we leave them alone They develop
their personalities and their musclesand if one proves to be too
much for his fellows we transfer him to a more advanced class where the
competition is keener and he learns what it is to lose

At puberty we add sex drive to the basics and by the time our male
reaches maturity we have something like George Actually George is
more mature than either you or I He has all the answers he needs Hes
strong solitary authoritative and selfish He has no curiosity and
resents encroachment Hes a complete individualist If he proves out he
should make an excellent sire

But isnt he dangerous to handle Kennon asked

Yes but we take precautions

Kennon grimaced with distaste

Look at it objectively Douglas said Were trying to select the best
physical type we can in the hope that hell pass his qualities to his
offspring and theres no better practical way to select the strongest
and hardiest than by natural selection We control their environment
as little as possible and let Nature do our educating until theyre old
enough to be useful

Naturally there are some things which we cannot provide such as
exposure to disease to the elements and to predators The one isnt
selective about whom it infects while the others would tend to produce
cooperation as a matter of survival

Isnt there a great deal of mortality under such a regimen Kennon
asked

Not as much as you might expect Its about twenty per cent And there
is a great deal of compensation from a management viewpoint We get
essentially the same physical end product as we would from a closely
managed operation plus a great saving in labor Males you see are
fairly expendable We only need a few a year

Its brutal

So it is but life is brutal Still its efficient for our purposes
We merely take advantage of natural impulses to produce a better
product Grandfather got the idea out of an old booksomething about
the noble savage natural selection and survival of the fittest He
thought it was greatsaid there was nothing like relentless competition
to bring out the strongest and hardiest types And hes been right for
centuries Can you imagine anything much better than Georgefrom a
physical viewpoint

He is a magnificent animal Kennon admitted as he eyed the Lani But
it seems to me that you could train some obedience into him

Douglas shook his head That would introduce a modifying factor
something bigger and more powerful than the male himself And that would
modify the results We can control them well enough with knockout gas
and shackles And those things oddly enough dont destroy their pride
or selfesteem They think that we use them because we are afraid and
it satisfies their egos

Kennon eyed the caged Lani dubiously This is going to be difficult
I must examine them and treat them but if theyre all as homicidal as
this one

You fight me man George interrupted his face twisted into lines of
transparent guile I am boss and others do as I say You beat me then
you are boss

Is this true Kennon asked

Oh its true enough Douglas said George is the leader and if you
beat him youd be top male until some other one got courage enough to
challenge you But hes just trying to get his hands on you Hed like
to kill

Kennon looked at the big humanoid appraisingly George was huge
at least five centimeters taller and fifteen kilograms heavier than
himself And he was all muscle I dont think Id care to accept that
challenge unless I was forced to Kennon said

Douglas chuckled I dont blame you

Kennon sighed It looks like we are going to need reinforcements to
get these brutes under control Im not going in there with them and I
cant examine them from out here

Oh we can hold them all right Paralysis gas and shackles will keep
them quiet Theres no need to bother the troopers We can handle this
by ourselves

Kennon shrugged Its your baby You should know what youre doing

I do Douglas said confidently Wait here until I get the gas
capsules and the equipment He turned and walked back to the entrance
to the cell block At the iris he turned Be careful he said

Dont worry I will Kennon looked at George through the bars and the
humanoid glared back his eyes bright with hatred Kennon felt the
short hairs prickle along the back of his neck George roused a primal
emotionan elemental dislike that was deeper than reasonan antagonism
intensely physical almost overpoweringa purely adrenal response that
had no business in the makeup of a civilized human

He had thought the Lani had a number of human traits until he had
encountered George But if George was a typical malethen the Lani were
alien He flexed his muscles and stared coldly into the burning blue
eyes behind the bars There would be considerable satisfaction in
beating this monstrosity to a quivering pulp Millennia of human
preeminenceof belief that nothing no matter how big or muscular
should fail to recognize that a mans person was inviolatefed the
fuel of his anger The most ferocious beasts on ten thousand worlds
had learned this lesson And yet this animal had laid hands on him
with intent to kill A cold corner of his mind kept telling him that he
wasnt behaving rationally but he disregarded it George was a walking
need for a lesson in manners

Dont get the idea that Im afraid of youyou overmuscled oaf Kennon
snapped I can handle you or anyone like you And if you put your hands
on me again Ill beat you within an inch of your worthless life

The Lani snarled Let me out and I kill you But you are like all men
You use gun and ironnot fair fight

Douglas returned with a gas capsule and a set of shackles All right
he said Were ready for him He handed Kennon the shackles and a key
to the cell doorand drew his Burkholtz

See the Lani growled It is as I say Men are cowards

You know gun Douglas asked as he pointed the muzzle of the Burkholtz
at the Lani

I know George growled Gun kill

It does indeed Douglas said Now get backclear back against the
wall

George snarled but didnt move

Ill count three Douglas said and if youre not back by then
Ill burn you down Youll obey even if you wont do anything
elseonetwo

George retreated to the far end of his cell

Now face the wall Douglas tossed the gas capsule into the cell The
thinwalled container broke releasing a cloud of vapor George
crumpled to the floor Now we wait a couple of minutes for the gas to
dissipate Douglas said After that hes all yours You can go in and
put the irons on him

Will he be out long Kennon asked

About five minutes After that hell have muscular control Douglas
chuckled Theyre stupid he said They know what gas does to them
but they never have sense enough to hold their breath They could be
twice as much trouble as they are All right its safe to go in now
Douglas let the gun dangle in his hand

Kennon unlocked the door

And George rolled over muscles bunched and driving He hit the door
with such force that Kennon was slammed against the wall dazedhalf
stunned by the speed of the attack Georgehe had time to think in one
brief flashwasnt stupid He had held his breath for the necessary two
minutes

Douglas jerked the blaster up and fired but his target was too quick
George dropped and rolled The sizzling streak of violet flashed inches
above his body and tore a sixinch hole through the back of the cell
And then George was on him The huge marvelously fast hands of the
humanoid wrenched the blaster out of Douglass hands and jerked him
forward A scream burst from Douglas as Georges hands closed around his
neck Muscles sprang into writhing life in the humanoids huge forearms
There was a soft brittle crack and Douglas sagged limp in the iron
grip that held him dangling

Faugh George grunted He dropped Douglas as Kennon pushed the door
back and came out into the passageway Maybe you make better fight
George said as he lowered his head into the muscular mass of his broad
shoulders

Kennon eyed him appraisingly swinging the irons in his right hand

This time the Lani didnt charge He moved slowly half crouched long
arms held slightly forward Kennon backed away watching the humanoids
eyes for that telltale flicker of the pupils that gives warning
of attack The expression on Georges face never changed It was
satisfiedsmug almostreflecting the feelings of a brute conditioned
to kill and given an opportunity to do so The Lani radiated confidence

Kennon shivered involuntarily He wasnt frightened but he had never
met an opponent like this A chill raced up the back of his legs and
spread over his stomach and chest His mouth was dry and his muscles
quivered with tense anticipation But his concentration never wavered
His hard blue eyes never left Georges searching with microscopic
intentness for the faintest sign of the Lanis intentions

George chargedhands reaching for Kennons throat face twisted in a
snarl of rage and hate But even as he charged Kennon moved He ducked
beneath the Lanis outstretched hands and drove his left fist deep into
Georges belly just below the breastbone

Air whistled out of the Lanis gaping mouth as he bent double from the
power of the blow Kennon clipped him on the chin with a driving knee
snapping Georges head back and smashed the bearded face with the
shackles Blood spurted and George screamed with rage One of the Lanis
big hands wrapped around the shackles and tugged Kennon let go and
drove another left to Georges ribs

The Lani threw the irons at Kennon but his aim was poor One of the
handcuff rings scraped across Kennons cheek but did nothing more
than break the skin Half paralyzed by the blows to his solar plexus
Georges coordination was badly impaired But he kept trying Kennon
wrapped lean fingers about one of Georges outstretched hands bent
pivoted and slammed the Lani with bonecrushing force against the bars
of a nearby cell But George didnt go down Hes more brute than man
Kennon thought No man could take a beating like that He moved aside
from Georges stumbling rush feeling a twinge of pity for the battered
humanoid It was no contest Strong as he was George didnt know the
rudiments of handtohand fighting His reactions were those of an
animal to close clutch bite and tear Even if he were completely
well the results would have been the same It would merely have taken
longer Kennon drove a vicious judo chop to the junction of the Lanis
neck and shoulder Brute strength was no match for the highly evolved
mayhem that every spaceman learns as a necessary part of his trade
George had never been on planet leave in a spaceport town He knew
nothing about the dives the crimps the hostile port police His idea
of fighting was that of a beast but Kennon was a civilized man to whom
fighting was an art perfected by millennia of warfare And Kennon knew
his trade

Even so it took longer than Kennon expected because George was big
George was strong and George had courage and pride that kept him coming
as long as the blazing will behind his blazing eyes could drive his
battered body But the end was inevitable

Kennon looked at his bloody arm where Georges teeth had reached their
mark It was hardly more than a scratch but it had been close George
had his lesson and Kennon felt oddly degraded He sighed dragged George
back into the cell and locked the door

Then he turned to Douglas The howls of hate from the caged Lani died to
a sullen silence as Kennon gently examined the limp body

Douglas wasnt dead His neck was dislocated not broken but he was in
serious condition Kennon was still bending over Douglas wondering how
to call for help when three guards burst through the door faces grim
weapons at the ready

Whats going on here the leader demanded The board showed an
open door down here He saw the bodyMr Douglas he gasped The
commandant will have to know about this He took a communicator from
his waist belt and spoke rapidly into it Arleson in stud cell block
he said Attempted escape One casualtyDouglas Alexanderyes
thats right Nohes not dead Send a litter and bearers Inform the
commandant I am making investigation on the spot Out He turned to
look coldly at Kennon

Who are youand what happened here he asked

Kennon told him

You mean you took George Arleson said

Look in his cell if you dont believe me

The soldier looked and then turned hack to Kennon There was awed
respect in his hard brown eyes You did thatto him Man youre a
fighter he said in an unbelieving voice

A stretcher detail manned by two soberfaced Lani females came in
loaded Douglass body on the stretcher and silently bore it away

Douglas was a fool Arleson said He knew we never handle this kind
without maximum restraint I wonder why he did it

I couldnt say He told me that gas and shackles would hold him

He knew better These Lani know gas capsules All George had to do was
hold his breath In that cell George would have killed you You couldnt
have stayed away from him

Kennon shrugged Maybe that was what Douglas had wanted Kennon sighed
He didnt have the answer And it could just be that Douglas had tried
to show off Well he would pay for it Hed have a stiff neck for
months and perhaps that was a proper way to end it

  

Commander Mullins a thin grayfaced man with the hard cold eyes of
a professional soldier came into the corridor followed by another
trooper

His eyes took in the wreckage that had been George the split lips
the smashed nose the puffed eyes the cuts and bruises and then raked
across Kennon

Spacemanhey he asked Ive seen work like that before

Kennon nodded I was once Im station veterinarian now Douglas called
me oversaid it was an emergency

Mullins nodded

Wellwhy arent you tending to it

I have to examine them Kennon said gesturing at the cells And I
dont want any more trouble like this

Dont worry You wont have it Now that youve beaten George youll
have no trouble at all Youre top dog Mullins gestured at the cages
Theyll be good for a while Now youd better get on with your work
Theres been enough disruption of routine for today The men will help
you

  

Kennon checked in at the commandants office before he left for the main
island

How is Douglas he asked

Hes alive Mullins said We flew him to Albertsvilleand good
riddance How are the Lani

Theyll be all right Kennon said Its just food poisoning I
suggest you check your kitchen and your food handlers Theres a break
in sanitation that could incapacitate your whole command I found a few
things wrong but there are probably more

Ill check on itand thanks for the advice Mullins said Sit down
Doctor Your airboat wont be serviced for another few minutes Tell me
how things are on the main island Hows Blalok

You know him

Of course I used to be a frequent visitor there But with that young
pup here I couldnt leave I didnt dare to Hed have disrupted
routine in a single day Look what he did in half an hour Frankly I
owe you a debt for getting him off my hands Mullins chuckled dryly

Thats a fine thing to say Kennon grinned But I can sympathize It
took us two months to straighten out Alexandria after the Bossman sent
him here

I heard about that

Wellwere under control now Things are going pretty smoothly

Theyll be better here Mullins said Now that Douglas is gone He
shrugged I hope the Boss doesnt send him back Hes hard to handle
and he makes discipline a problem

Could you tell meor would it be violating security Kennon said
Why do you have a Class II installation on full war footing out here

Mullins chuckled Its no secret he said There was a commercial
raid on this place about fifty years ago Seems as though one of our
competitors didnt like us Alexandria was on a war footing then and
managed to hold them off But it scared the Old Man You see our
competitive position is based on Lani labor Our competitors didnt know
that Their intelligence wasnt so good Up until that time wed been
keeping the males out here in what was hardly more than a stockade
Those people could have taken a few dozen females and a couple of males
and theyd have been in business But they didnt know They tried to
smash Alexandria instead Naturally they didnt have a chance And after
it was over the Old Man got smart He still had the tapes for Alexandria
so he built a duplicate out here and spent a few millions on modern
armament The way were set now itd take a battle group to hurt us

But how about security Dont the others know about the Lani now

Its a moot question But it wont do them any good They cant crack
this place and without males all the females on Flora wouldnt do
them enough longterm good to pay for the force theyd need to be
successful

So thats why the males are isolated

Theres another reasontwo of them in fact One is physical Even
the best male is a dangerous beast They have a flair for violence that
makes them useless as labor and their training doesnt help matters
And the other is mental The females on the main island believe that we
humans are responsible for the continuation of their breed This tends
to keep them in line We have a great deal more trouble with them out
here once they know the truth Weve had a number of cases of females
trying to engineer a males escape But theyre never repeated Mullins
said grimly Actually it would be an interesting life out here except
for the abattoir He grimaced Thats an unpleasant chore

You mean Kennon said

Why certainly What else could we do with senile animals

But thats murder

Mullins shook his head No more than killing a cow for beef

You know Kennon said Ive never thought of what happened to aged
Lani Sure Ive never seen one butLord ListerIm a fool

Youll get used to the idea Mullins said They arent human and
except for a few they arent as intelligent as a Santosian Varl I know
that they look like us except for those tails but thats as far as it
goes Ive spent two hundred years with them and I know what Im talking
about

Thats what Alexander says

He should know Hes lived with them all his life

Wellperhaps But Im not convinced

Neither was Old Docnot until the day he died

Did he change then

I dont know I wasnt there But Old Doc was a stubborn cuss

Kennon stood up Ive given instructions for treatment to your
corpsman he said Now I think Id better be getting back I have some
reports to finish

Mullins smiled grimly You know he said I get the feeling that you
dont approve of this operation

Frankly I dont Kennon said but I signed a contract He turned
toward the door and gestured to the two Lani who waited outside with his
bags I can find my way to the roof he said

Wellgood luck Mullins said Well call you again if we need you

Do that Kennon replied He wanted to leave to get away from this
place and back to the main island He wanted to see Copper Hed be
damned if anyone was going to butcher her If he had to stay here until
she died of old age hed do it But nobody was going to hurt her



CHAPTER XII

Kennon wondered if his colleagues in human medicine felt toward their
patients as he did toward the Lani or if they ultimately lost their
individuality and became mere hosts for diseases parasites
and tumorsvehicles for the practice of surgical and medical
skillseconomic units whose wellbeing meant a certain amount of
credits Probably not he decided They were human and their very
humanity made them persons rather than things

But the possession of individuality was not an asset in the practice of
animal medicine where economics was the main factor and the satisfaction
of the owner the principal personality problem The normal farm animals
the shrakes cattle sheep morks and swine were no problem They were
merely a job But the Lani were different They werent human but they
were intelligent and they did have personality even though they didnt
possess that indefinable quality that separated man from the beasts It
was hard to treat them with dispassionate objectivity In fact it was
impossible

And this lack of objectivity annoyed him Should he be this way Was he
right to identify them as individuals and treat them as persons
rather than things The passing months had failed to rob them of their
personalities they had not become the faceless mass of a herd of cattle
or a flock of sheep They were still not essentially different
from humansand wouldnt men themselves lose many of their human
characteristics if they were herded into barracks and treated as
property for forty generations Wouldnt men too approach the animal
condition if they were bred and treated as beasts their pedigrees
recorded their types winnowed and selected The thought was annoying

It would be better Kennon reflected if he didnt have time to think
if he were so busy he could drop to his bed exhausted each night and
sleep without dreaming if he could keep on the run so fast that he
wouldnt have time to sit and reflect But he had done his work too
well He had trained his staff too thoroughly They could handle the
petty routines of minor treatment and laboratory tests as well as he He
had only the intellectual stimulation of atypical cases and these were
all too rare The routine inspections were boring yet he forced himself
to make them because they filled the time The hospital wards were
virtually empty of patients the work was up to date the whole island
was enjoying a carnival of health and Kennon was still impaled upon
the horns of his dilemma It wasnt so bad now that the first shock was
over but it was bad enoughand showed no signs of getting better Now
that Copper realized he wanted her she did nothing to make his life
easier Instead she did her best to get underfoot usually in some
provocative position It was enough to try the patience of a marble
statue Kennon reflected grimly But it did have its humorous side
and were it not for the fact that Copper wasnt human could have
been thoroughly enjoyable That however was the real hell of it He
couldnt relax and enjoy the contesthis feet were on too slippery
ground And Copper with her unerring female instinct knew just what to
do to make the footing slipperier Sooner or later she was certain that
he would fall It was only a question of applying sufficient pressure at
the right spot and the right time Now that she knew he desired her
she was content to wait The only thing that had bothered her was the
uncertainty whether he cared or not For Copper the future was a simple
thing and she was lighthearted about it But not so Kennon Even after
the initial shock had passed there still remained the moral customs the
conditioning and the prohibitions But Copperwas Copperand somehow
the conditioning lost its force in her presence Perhaps he thought
wryly it was a symptom of the gradual erosion of his moral character in
this abnormal environment

Im getting stale he confided to Copper as he sat in his office idly
turning the pages of the Kardon Journal of Allied Medical Sciences
Theres nothing to do thats interesting

You could help me Copper said as she looked up from the pile of cards
she was sorting He had given her the thankless task of reorganizing the
files and she was barely half through the project

Theres nothing to do thats interesting he repeated He cocked his
head to one side From this angle Copper looked decidedly intriguing as
she bent over the file drawer and replaced a stack of cards

I could suggest something Copper said demurely

Yes I know he said Youre full of suggestions

I was thinking that we could go on a picnic

A what

A picnic Take a lunch and go somewhere in the jeep Maybe up into the
hills I think it might be fun

Why not Kennon agreed At least it would break the monotony Tell
you what You run up to the house and tell Kara to pack a lunch and
well take the day off

Good I hoped youd say that Im getting tired of these dirty old
cards She stood up and sidled past the desk Kennon resisted the
impulse to slap as she went past and congratulated himself on his
selfcontrol as she looked at him with a halfdisappointed expression
on her face She had expected it he thought gleefully Score one for
morality




He smiled Whatever the other Lani might be Copper was different
Quick volatile intelligent she was a constant delight a flashing
kaleidoscope of unexpected facets Perhaps the others were the same if
he knew them better But he didnt know themand avoided learning In
that direction lay ulcers

Well go to Olympus he said

Copper looked dubious Id rather not go there Thats forbidden
ground

Oh nonsense Youre merely superstitious

She smiled Perhaps youre right You usually are

Thats the virtue of being a man Even if Im wrong Im right He
chuckled at the peculiar expression on her face

Now off with youand get that lunch basket packed

She bowed Yes master Your slave flies on winged feet to execute your
commands

Kennon chuckled Copper had been reading Old Docs romances again He
recognized the florid style

  

Kennon landed the jeep in a mountain meadow halfway up the slope of
the peacefully slumbering volcano It was quiet and cool and the light
breeze was blowing Olympuss smoky cap away from them to the west
Copper unpacked the lunch She moved slowly After all there was plenty
of time and she wasnt very hungry Neither was Kennon

Lets go for a walk Copper said The woods look cooland maybe we
can work up an appetite

Good idea I could use some exercise That lunch looks big enough to
choke a horse and Id like to do it justice

They walked through the woods skirting scant patches of underbrush
slowly moving higher on the mountain slopes The trees unlike those
of Beta did not end abruptly at a snow line but pushed green fingers
upward through passages between old lava flows on whose black wrinkled
surfaces nothing grew The faint hum of insects and the piping calls of
the birdlike mammals added to the impression of remoteness It was hard
to believe that scarcely twenty kilometers from this primitive microcosm
was the border of the highly organized and productive farmlands of
Outworld Enterprises

Do you think we can see the hospital if we go high enough Copper
said She panted a little unaccustomed to the altitude

Possibly Kennon said It is a long distance away But we should be
able to see Alexandria he added Thats high enough and big enough
He looked at her curiously How is it that youre so breathless
he asked Were not that high Youre getting fat with too much soft
living

Copper smiled Perhaps Im getting old

Nonsense Kennon chuckled Its just fat Come to think of it you
are plumper Not that I mind but if youre going to keep that sylphlike
figure youd better go on a diet

Youre too good to me Copper said

Youre darn right I am Welllets get going Exercise is always good
for the waistline and Id like to see whats up ahead

Scarcely a kilometer ahead they came to a wall of lava that barred their
path Oh oh Kennon said We cant go over that He looked at the
wrinkled and shattered rock with its knifelike edges

I dont think my feet could take it Copper admitted

It looks like the end of the trail

Nonot quite Kennon said There seems to be a path here He
pointed to a narrow cleft in the black rock Lets see where it goes

Copper hung back I dont think I want to she said doubtfully It
looks awfully dark and narrow

Oh stop it Nothings going to hurt us Come on Kennon took her
hand

Unwillingly Copper allowed herself to be led forward Theres something
about this place that frightens me she said uncomfortably as the high
black wails closed in narrowing until only a slit of yellow sky was
visible overhead The path underfoot was surprisingly smooth and free
from rocks but the narrow corridor steeped in shadows was gloomy and
depressingly silent It even bothered Kennon although he wouldnt
admit it What forces had sliced this razorthin cleft in the dense
rock around them Earthquake probably And if it happened once it could
happen again He would hate to be trapped here entombed in shattered
rock

Gradually the passage widened then abruptly it ended A bleak vista of
volcanic ash dotted with sputter cones opened before them It was a
flat tableland roughly circular scarcely half a kilometer across
a desolation of black rock stunted trees and underbrush and gray
volcanic ash A crater somewhat larger than the rest lay with its
nearest edge about two hundred meters away The rock edges were fire
polished gleaming in the yellow sunshine and the thin margin of trees
and brush surrounding the depression were gnarled and shrunken twisted
into fantastic shapes

Hey whats this Kennon asked curiously That crater looks peculiar
like a meteor had struck herebut those stunted plantshmmthere
must have been some radioactivity too He looked at the crater
speculatively Now I wonder he began

Copper had turned a sickly white No she said in a halfstrangled
voiceoh no

Kennon looked at her You know what this is he demanded

No Copper said But her voice was unsteady

Youre lying

But I dont know Copper wailed Im only guessing Ive never seen
this place before in my life Pleaselets get out of here

Then you know about this Kennon demanded

I think its the Pit Copper said The redes dont say where it is
But the description fitsthe Circle of Death the Twisted Landits
all like the redes say

Redeswhat are redes And what is this business about circles of
death Theres something here thats peculiar and I want to know what it
is

Its nothing Truly Just lets go back Lets leave this place Its
no good Its tabu

Tabu Youve never used that word before

Forbidden

Who forbids it

The Godsthe Old Ones It is not for Lani Nor for you Her voice was
harsh Come away before it is too late Before the Silent Death strikes
you down

Im going to have a look at this

Youll be killed Copper said And if you die I die too

Dont be foolish Theres nothing here that can hurt me See those
trees and plants growing right up to the craters edge If they can
take it permanently I can stand it for a few moments If theres any
radioactivity there its not very much

But the redes say

Oh forget those redes I know what Im doing Besides Im a Betan and
can stand more radiation than most men A brief exposure isnt going to
hurt me

You go and I go too Copper said desperately

Youll stay here where its safe Kennon said flatly

Im going with you Copper repeated I dont want to live without
you

I tell you I wont be hurt And one quick look isnt going to bother
whatevers down there

Thats what Roga the Foolish said when he opened Lyssas tower But
he brought men to Flora And your little look may bring an even greater
calamity

Kennon shrugged and started Walking toward the craters edge

Copper followed

He turned to order her back but the words died on his tips as he saw
the terror and determination on her face Neither commands nor pleas
would move her If he went she would follow The only way he could stop
her would be with violence and he didnt want to manhandle her He felt
an odd mixture of pride tenderness and admiration for her Were their
situations reversed he doubted whether he would have the courage she
was showing He sighed Perhaps she was right Perhaps he did need an
antiradiation suit

All right he said You win Ill get some protective clothing and
look at it later

Her knees sagged but he caught her before she fell and held her erect
until her strength returned Belatedly he understood the emotional
strain that had been gripping her If you come back later sir youll
take me with you The words were a statement not a question

He nodded Providing you wear a radiation suit he said

She grimaced with distaste and he chuckled Clothing and Copper simply
didnt get along together

Well

All right she said unhappily

And theres one more condition

Whats that she asked suspiciously

That you tell me about this place You obviously know something about
it and with all your talking youve never mentioned it to me

It is forbidden to talk of these things to men Copper saidand then
perversely Do you want me to tell you now

Noit can wait We have come a long way and I am hungry I listen
poorly on an empty stomach Lets go back to the jeep and you can tell
me later

Copper smiled Thats good she said Id feel better away from this
place



CHAPTER XIII

I was a poor learner of the redes Copper confessed And Ill have to
skip the Mysteries I never even tried to learn them Somehow I was sure
Id never be a preceptress She settled herself more comfortably on the
tawny grass and watched him as he lay on his back beside her

Eh Kennon said Preceptress

The guardians of our traditions They know the redes and mysteries by
heart

And you have kept your religion alive that way all these years

It isnt exactly religion Copper said Its more like history we
learn it to remember that we were once a great raceand that we may
be again Someday there will come a male a leader to bring us out of
bondage and our race will be free of dependence on men There will
be pairings again and freedom to live as we please She looked
thoughtfully at Kennon You might even be the oneeven though you are
human Youre different from the others

Youre prejudiced Kennon smiled Im no different Wellnot very
different at any rate

That is not my thought Copper said You are very different indeed
No man has ever resisted a Lani as long as you have

Kennon shook his head Lets not go into that now What are these
redes

I do not remember them all Copper apologized I was

Youve said that before Tell me what you do know

I remember the beginning fairly well she said It goes back to the
time before Flora when everything was nothing and the Master Himself was
lonely

Without warning her voice changed to a rhythmic cadenced chant that
was almost a song Her face became rapt and introspective as she rocked
slowly from side to side The rhythm was familiar and then he recognized
itthe unintelligible music he had often heard coming from the barracks
late at night when no men were aroundthe voiceless humming that the
Lani sang at work

First there was Darknessstarless and sunless

Void without formdarker than night

Then did the MasterLord of Creation

Wave His right hand saying Let there be light

Verse Kennon thought That was logical People remember poetry better
than prose But the form was not what hed normally expect It was
advanced a style that was past primitive blank verse or heroic
pentameter He listened intently as Copper went on

 Light filled the heavens bright golden glowing
 Brought to the Void by His wondrous hand
 Then did the MasterLord of Creation
 Nod His great head saying Let there be land
 Air land and water formed into being
 Born in the sight of His allseeing eyes
 Then did the masterLord of Creation
 Smile as He murmured Let life arise
 All of the life conceived by the Master
 Varied in shape as the grasses and birds
 Hunters and hunted moveless and moving
 Came into form at the sound of His words

Thats a great deal like Genesis Kennon said with mild astonishment
Where could you have picked that up

From the beginning of our race Copper said It came to us with Ulf
and Lyssabut what is Genesis

A part of an ancient religionone that is still followed on some of
the Central Worlds Its followers call themselves Christians They say
it came from Earth the motherworld of men

Our faith has no name We are children of Lyssa who was a daughter of
the Master

It is an odd similarity Kennon said But other races have had
stories of the Creation And possibly there may be another explanation
Your ancestors could have picked this up from Alexanders men They came
from Earth originally and some of them could have been Christians

No Cooper said This rede is long before Man Alexander It is
the origin of our world even before Ulf and Lyssa It is the first
Bookthe Book of the Godspell Man Alexander came in the sixth
Bookthe Book of Roga

Theres no point in arguing about it Kennon said Go ontell me the
rest

Its going to be a long story Copper said Even though I have
forgotten some of it I can chant the redes for hours

Kennon braced his back against one of the fat tires of the jeep Im a
good listener he said

She chuckled You asked for this she saidand took up the verses
where she had left off And Kennon learned the Lani version of creation
of the first man and woman cast out of Heaven for loving each other
despite the Masters objection of how they came to Flora and founded
the race of the Lani He learned how the Lani grew in numbers and power
how they split into two warring groups over the theological point of
whether Ulf or Lyssa was the principal deity how Roga the Foolish
opened Lyssas tower to find out whether the Ulfians or Lyssans were
right and brought the Black Years to Flora

He heard the trial of Roga and the details of his torture by the priests
of Ulf and the priests of Lyssaunited by this greatest sacrilege And
he heard the Lani version of the landing of Alexanders ship and mans
conquest of Flora

It was a story of savagery and superstition of blood and intolerance
of bravery and cowardice of love and beauty Yet through it all even
through the redes that described the Conquest there was a curious
remoteness a lack of emotion that made the verses more terrible as they
flowed in passionless rhythm from Coppers lips

Thats enough Kennon said

I told you you wouldnt like it

Its horrible How can you remember such things

We begin to learn them as soon as we can talk We know the redes almost
our entire lives Copper was silent for a moment Theres lots more
she said but its all about our lives since the Man Alexanderthe old
onetook possession of us And most of the newer redes are pretty dull
Our life hasnt changed much since the men came The Book of Man is
boring Copper sighed I have dared a great deal by telling you these
things If the others knew they would kill both of us

Then why tell me he asked

I love you she said simply You wanted to knowand I can deny you
nothing

A wave of tenderness swept over him She would give her life for
himand what would he give Nothing Not even his prejudices His face
twisted If she was only human If she wasnt just an animal If
he wasnt a Betan If if if Resentment gorged his throat It was
unfairso damned unfair He had no business coming here He should have
stayed on Beta or at least on a human world where he would never have
met Copper He loved her but he couldnt have her It was Tantalus and
Sisyphus rolled into one unsightly package and fastened to his
soul With a muttered curse he rose to his feet and as he did he
stoppedfrozenstaring at Copper as though he had never seen her
before

How did you say that Roga was judged responsible for Alexander coming
here he demanded

He went into Lyssas towerwhere Ulf and Lyssa tried to call
Heavenand with his foolish meddling set the tower alight with a glow
that all could see Less than a week later the Man Alexander came

Where was this tower

Where Alexandria now stands Man Alexander destroyed it and built his
house upon its ruins

And what was that place of the Pit

The Shrine of Ulfwhere the GodEgg struck Flora It is buried in the
pit but the Silent Death has protected it from blasphemyand besides
Man Alexander never learned about it We feared that he would destroy it
as he did Lyssas tower

A wild hope stirred in Kennon Were going home he announced

Good

And were going to get a pair of radiation suitsand then were coming
back Well have a good look at that Pit and if whats in there is what
I think it ishis face was a mixture of grimness and eagernesswell
blow this whole operation off this planet

Copper blanched It is death to meddle with the GodEgg she said

Superstition Kennon scoffed If that Egg is what I think it was
made by men and you are their descendant

Perhaps youre right but I cant help thinking you are wrong she
said soberly Look at the trouble that came with Rogas meddling Be
careful that you do not bring us a worse fate

Ill be very careful Well take every precaution

We

Youre coming of course I cant imagine you staying away

Copper nodded

You shouldnt worry so much Kennon teased You know we men live
forever

That is true

And if Im right youre just as human as I And youre capable of
living as long as I do

Yes sir Copper said Her voice was unconvinced her expression
noncommittal

You females Kennon said in quick exasperation You drive a man
crazy Get an idea in your head and it takes triatomate to blast it out
Now lets go

Two hours brought them back to the volcanic area and knowing what to
look for Kennon located the pockmarked mountain valley From the air it
looked completely ordinary Kennon was amazed at the perfection of the
natural camouflage The Pit was merely another crater in the pitted
ground He dropped to a lower altitude barely a hundred feet above the
sputter cones Look he said

Below them was the crater of the Pit and in its center a smooth
bluishblack hemisphere protruded from the crater floor It would have
passed unnoticed by the casual eyenearly concealed by two gigantic
blocks of pumice

The GodEgg Copper exclaimed

Eggha thats a spacer I thought it would be Id recognize durilium
anywhere Lets go down and look this over but first we want a couple
of pictures He pointed a camera at the crater and snapped the shutter
Therenow lets have a closer look at our baby

Do you expect me to get into that thing Copper said distastefully as
she prodded the shapeless green coveralls with a bare toe She eyed the
helmet gloves and boots with equal distaste Id suffocate

If you want to come with me youll wear it Kennon said Otherwise
you wont come near that pit Try it and Ill chain you to the jeep

You wouldnt

Just try me

Ohall right Ill wear the thingbut I wont be comfortable

Who cares about that Youll be protected

All rightshow me how to put it on Id rather be with you than worry
about what you are doing

The suit was several sizes too large but it covered her adequately
Too adequately Kennon decided She looked like a pile of wrinkles with
legs He chuckled

She glared So Im funny she said Let me tell you something else
thats funny Im hot Im sweating I itch Nowlaugh

I dont feel like laughing Kennon said I feel the same way

They approached the edge of the Pit carefully Kennon kept checking
the radiation counter The needle slowly rose and steadied at onehalf
roentgen per hour as he thrust the probe over the rim of the depression
Its fine so far he said encouragingly We could take this much
for quite a while even without suits He lowered himself over the edge
sliding down the gentle slope

How is it down there Copper called The intercom crackled in his ear

Finebarely over one roentgen per hour With these suits we could
stay here indefinitely The sigh of relief was music in her ears This
place is barely lukewarm

Thats what you think Copper said

I mean radiation warm Kennon said Stay up there and watch me I may
need some things

All right Copper squirmed inside the hot suit The thing was an oven
She hoped that Kennon didnt plan to work in the daytime It would be
impossible

Kennon gingerly approached the ship It was half buried in the loose
debris and ash that had fallen or blown into the pit during the
centuries it had rested there It was oldincredibly old The hull
design was ancientriveted sheets of millimeterthick durilium Ships
hadnt been built like that in over two thousand years And the ovoid
shape was reminiscent of the even more ancient spindizzy design A
hyperspace converter like that couldnt be less than four millennia
old It was a museum piece but the blueblack hull was as smooth and
unblemished as the day it had left fabrication

Space travel would have gotten nowhere without durilium Kennon
reflected For five thousand years men had used the incredibly tough
synthetic to build their spacecraft It had given man his empire Kennon
gave the hull one quick glance That part of the ship didnt worry him
It was what he would find inside that bothered him How much damage had
occurred from two thousand or more years of disuse How much had the
original travelers cannibalized How much could be salvaged What sort
of records remained There were a thousand questions that the interior
of that enigmatic hull might answer

The upper segment of the airlock was visible It was closed which was a
good sign A few hours work with a digger should expose it enough to be
opened

Copper he said were going to have to dig this out Theres a small
excavator in the cargo bed of the jeep Do you think you can bring it
down here

I think so

Good girl Kennon turned back to the ship He was eager to enter it
There might be things inside that would settle the question of the Lani
The original crew had probably recognized the value of the hull as
a repository as well as he did But in the meantime there would be
worklots of it And every step must be recorded

It was the rest of the days work to expose the emergency airlock The
little excavator toiled over the loose ash for hours before it displaced
enough to make the port visible and the ash was not yet cleared away
sufficiently to open the portal when darkness brought a halt to the
work

It would be impossible to unearth the spaceship with their lowcapacity
digger Kennon decided It would be difficult enough to clear the
emergency airlock in the nose But if the tubes and drive were still
all right by careful handling it should be possible to use the drive to
blast out the loose ash and cinders which surrounded the hull

Kennon reluctantly gave up the idea of entering the spaceship That
would have to wait until tomorrow Now they would have to conceal the
work and call it a day A few branches and the big blocks of pumice
would suffice for temporary camouflage Later they could make something
better Anything in the jeep which might be useful was cached along with
the radiation suits in the passageway through the lava walland in a
surprisingly short time they were heading homeward

Kennon was not too displeased Tomorrow they would be able to enter
the ship Tomorrow they would probably have some of the answers to his
questions He looked ahead into the gathering night The gray mass of
the abandoned Olympus Station slipped below them as he lined the jeep
along the path indicated by the luminous arrow atop the main building
set the controls on automatic and locked the craft on the guide beacon
in Alexandrias tower In a little less than an hour they would be home



CHAPTER XIV

Kennon was morally certain that the Lani were of human stock Evolved
of course Mutated Genetic strangers to the rest of humanity But
human The spaceship and the redes proved it as far as he was concerned
But moral certainty and legal certainty were two different things What
he believed might be good enough to hold up in a Brotherhood court but
he doubted it Ulf and Lyssa might be the founders of the Lani race but
they had come to Kardon nearly four thousand years ago and no records
existed to prove that the Lani werent here before they came Redes
passed by word of mouth through hundreds of generations were not
evidence Even the spaceship wasnt the absolute proof that would be
needed to overturn the earlier legal decision Other and better
proof was neededsomething that would stand up in any court in the
Brotherhood He hoped the spaceship would hold that proof

But Kennons eagerness to find out what was inside the ancient spacer
was tempered by hard practicality Too much depended on what he might
find inside that hull Every step of the work must be documented beyond
any refutation Some method of establishing date time and location had
to be prepared There must be a record of every action And that would
require equipment and planning There must be no mistake that could be
twisted by the skillful counsel that Alexander undoubtedly retained

He had no doubt that the Family would fight Too much money and
prestige were involved To prove the Lani human would destroy Outworld
Enterprises on Kardon Yet this thought did not bother him To his
surprise he had no qualms of conscience He was perfectly willing to
violate his contract break faith with his employers and plot their
ruin The higher duty came firstthe duty to the human race

He smiled wryly It wasnt all higher duty There were some personal
desires that leavened the nobility To prove Copper human was enough
motivationactually it was better than his sense of duty Events
Kennon reflected cause a great deal of change in ones attitude
Although not by nature a plotter schemes had been flitting through his
mind with machinelike regularity to be examined and discarded or to be
set aside for future reference

He rejected the direct approach It was too dangerous depended too much
on personalities and had too little chance for success He considered
the possibility of letters to the Brotherhood Council but ultimately
rejected it Not only was the proof legally insufficient to establish
humanity in the Lani but he also remembered Alexanders incredible
knowledge of his activities and there was no reason to suppose that
his present didnt receive the same scrutiny as the past And if he
who hadnt written a letter in over a year suddenly began to write the
correspondence would undoubtedly be regarded with suspicion and would
probably be examined and Dirac messages would be out for the same
reason

He could take a vacation and while he was away from the island he
could inform the Brotherhood Leaving Flora wouldnt be particularly
difficult but leaving Kardon would be virtually impossible His
contract called for vacations but it expressly provided that they would
be taken on Kardon And again there would be no assurance that his
activities would not be watched In fact it was probable that they
would be

There was nothing that could be done immediately But there were certain
longrange measures that could be started He could begin preparing a
case that could be presented to the Council And Beta when it knew
would help him The situation of the Lani was so close to Betas own
that its obvious merit as a test case simply could not be ignored If
he could get the evidence to Beta it would be easy to enlist the aid
of the entire MedicoTechnological Civilization It would take time and
attention to detail the case the evidence everything would have to
be prepared with every safeguard and contingency provided so that there
would not be the slightest chance of a slipup once it came to court

And perhaps the best method of bringing the evidence would be to
transport it under its own power The thought intrigued him Actually it
wouldnt be too difficult Externally the Egg wasnt in bad shape The
virtually indestructible durilium hull was still intact The controls
and the engines hermetically sealed inside the hull were probably as
good as the day they stopped running The circuitry would undoubtedly be
bad but it could be repaired and restored and new fuel slugs could be
obtained for the engine and the converter But that was a problem for
the future

The immediate problem was to get into the ship in a properly documented
fashion

It took nearly two months but finally under the impersonal lenses of
cameras and recorders the entrance port of the GodEgg swung open and
revealed the dark interior Kennon moved carefully recording every step
as he entered the black orifice in the spaceships side His handtorch
gave plenty of light for the recorders as he moved insideCopper at his
heels both of them physically unrecognizable in antiradiation suits

Why are we moving so slowly Copper said Lets go ahead and find out
whats beyond this passageway

From a superstitious coward youve certainly become a reckless
explorer he said

The Egg hasnt hurt us and weve been around it many times she said
Either the curse has become too old to hurt us or there never was any
in the first place So lets see what is ahead Im curious

Kennon shook his head In this business we must hurry slowlyvery
slowly You know why

But I want to see

Patience girl Simmer down Youll see soon enough Kennon said Now
help me set up this camera

Oh all rightbut isnt there any excitement in you

Im bubbling over with it Kennon admitted but I manage to keep it
under control

Youre coldblooded

NoIm sensible We want to nail this down My future yours and that
of your people depend upon how carefully we work You wouldnt want to
let us all down by being too eager would you

She shook her head Noyoure right of course But I still would like
to see

They moved cautiously through the airlock and into the control room

Ah Kennon said with satisfaction I hoped for this but I didnt
dare expect it

What

Look around What do you see

Nothing but an empty room Its shaped like half an orange and it has
a lot of funny instruments and dials on the walls and a video screen
overhead But thats all Whywhats so unusual about it It looks just
like someone had left it

Thats the point Theres nothing essential thats missing They didnt
cannibalize the instrumentsand they didnt come back

Why not

Maybe because that curse you mentioned a few minutes ago was real

Copper drew back But you said it wouldnt hurt us

Not now The heats practically gone but when whoever flew this crate
came here the whole shell could have been as hot as a Samarian summer

But couldnt they have come back when it cooled

Not with this kind of heat The hull was probably too radioactive to
approach from the outside And radioactivity cools off slowly It might
take several lifetimes for its level to become low enough to approach if
there was no decontamination equipment available

I suppose thats why the early ones thought the Egg was cursed

Kennon nodded Now lets checkoh oh whats this He pointed to a
metalbacked book lying on the control panel

It looks like a book Copper said

Im hoping its the book

The book

Yesthe ships log Its possible And if it is we may have all the
evidence we needCopperDont touch it

Why not

Because its position has to be recorded first Wait until we get the
camera and recorders set up

  

Gingerly Kennon opened the ancient book The sheets inside were
brittlecrumbling with agebut he could make out the title UNSS
Wanderer with the date of launching and a lower line which read Ships
Log Kennon was thankful for his medical training The four years
of Classical English that he had despised so much were essential now
Stumbling over unfamiliar words and phrases he moved slowly through
the log tracing the old ships history from pleasure craft to shorthaul
freight tractor to obsolescence in a space dump orbiting around a world
called Heaven

There was a gap of nearly ten years indicated by a blank page before the
entries resumed

Ahthis is it Kennon said

What is it Copper said curiously I cant read the writing

Of course you cant Its in Englisha language that became
obsolete during the Interregnum I had to learn it since most medical
terminology is based on it

What is an Interregnum Copper interrupted Ive never heard that word
before

Its a period of confusion when there is no stable government The last
one came after the Second Galactic Warbut never mind thatit happened
long ago and isnt important now The important thing that did happen
was the Exodus

What was that

A religious revival and a tremendous desire to see what was happening
beyond the next star During that century men traveled wider and farther
then they ever have before or since In that outward explosion with
its mixed motivations of religion and practicality colonists and
missionaries went starward to find new worlds to tame and new races to
be rescued from the darkness of idolatry and hell Almost any sort
of vehicle capable of mounting a spindizzy converter was pressed into
service The old spindizzies were soundly engineered converters of
almost childlike simplicity that could and did carry ships enormous
distances if their passengers didnt care about subjective timelag and
a little radioactivity

And thats what happened to this ship According to this log it was
bought by Alfred and Melissa Weyganda missionary couple with the idea
of spreading the Christian faith to the heathen

Alfred and MelissaUlf and Lyssathey were a part of this ancient
explosion that scattered human seed across parsecs of interstellar
space It seems that they were a unit in a missionary fleet that had
gone out to the stars with flame in their hearts and Gospel on their
lips to bring the Word to the benighted heathen on other worlds
Kennons lips curled with mild contempt at their stupid foolhardiness
even as his pulse quickened to their bravery They had been fanatics
true enough but theirs was a selfless fanaticism that would risk
torture and death for what they believeda fanaticism that was more
sublime than the concept of Brotherhood which had evolved from it They
knew nothing of the enmity of race of the incessant struggle man
had since waged with alien intelligences all too willing to destroy
intruders who encroached upon their worlds Mankinds early selflessness
had long ago been discarded for frank expansionism and dominance over
the lesser races that stood in their way And in a way it was too bad

The ships log meticulously kept in neat round English script told a
story that was more than the bare bones of flight There was passion
and tenderness and a spiritual quality that was shocking to a modern
man steeped in millennia of conquest and selfinterest There was a
greatness to it a depth of faith that had since been lost And as
Kennon slowly deciphered the ancient script he admired the courage even
as his mind winced with dismay at the unheeding recklessness

The Weygands had lost contact with the others and had searched for them
in hyperspace doubling and twisting upon their course until they had
become hopelessly lost and then with their fuel nearly exhausted had
broken out into the normal threespace continuum to find Kardons sun
and the world they called Flora

How little they had known and how lucky they had been

It was only by the grace of their God that they had found this world
before their fuel was exhausted And it was only by further grace that
the planet was habitable and not populated with intelligent life They
had more luck than people were entitled to in a dozen lifetimes Against
odds of a million to one they had survived

It was fascinating reading

But it was not proof

The last entry read We have circled this world and have seen no
buildingsno sign of intelligent life We are lost marooned on this
empty world Our fuel supplies are too low for us to attempt to find the
others Nor could we The constellations in the sky are strange We do
not know which way to go Therefore we shall land upon the great island
in the center of the yellow sea And perhaps someday men will come to us
since we cannot return to them Melissa thinks that this is an example
of Divine Providence that the Lords mercy has been shown to us that
were lost in the vastness of the deepthat we have been chosen like
Eve and Adam to spread the seed of man to yet another world I hope
she is right yet I fear the radiation level of the ship has become
inordinately high We may well be Eve and Adam yet an Adam that cannot
beget and an Eve that is not fruitful I am trimming the ship for
landing and we shall leave it immediately after we have landed taking
with us only what we absolutely need There is too much radiation from
the spindizzy and the drive to remain here longerand God knows how hot
the outer hull may be

And that was all Presumptive evidenceyes Reasonable certaintyyes
But not proof Lawyers could argue that since no direct exploration was
made there was no valid reason to assume that the Lani did not already
inhabit Kardon But Kennon knew His body more perceptive than his
mind had realized a truth that his brain would not accept until he read
the log It was at once joy and frustration Joy that Copper was human
frustration that he could not obtain for her and her race the rights
to which they were entitled But the immediate problem was solved His
conditioning was broken now he was convinced that Copper was a member
of the human race It was no violation of his code to love her The
greatest barrier was broken and with it gone the lesser ones would
yield Relief that was almost pain washed through him and left him weak
with reaction

What is it Copper asked as he turned to her What is this thing that
has turned your face to joy

Cant you guess

She shook her head I have seen nothing but you reading this ancient
book yet you turn to me with the look in your eyes that the redes say
Ulf had for Lyssa

Youre human

Copper shrugged Youre mad Im a Lani I was born a Laniand I shall
die one

Dont you understand All Lani are human You all are the descendants
of two humans who came here thousands of years ago

Then there is no reason why you cannot love me

Kennon shook his head No he said There is no reason

Copper laughed It was a sound so merry and gay that Kennon looked at
her in surprise She looked as happy as she sounded

Simple and savage Kennon thought She cared nothing for the future and
probably very little about the injustice of her present The thing that
mattered was that what had kept them apart was gone She was probably
offering mental sacrifices to the Old Ones who had caused this change
in the man she loved She didnt really care about what had caused the
change To her it was sufficient that it had happened

For a moment Kennon wished that it could be as simple for him as it
apparently was for her The fact that Copper was human posed a greater
problem than the one it solved The one had been personal The other was
infinitely greater He could not let it lie The very morality which had
kept him from doing what he wished when he thought she was a humanoid
now forced him to do what he did not wish Every instinct said to leave
it alone The problem was too great for one man to solve the situation
too complicated the evidence too inconclusive the opposition too
powerful It would be far better to take his happiness and enjoy it
It was not his problem to solve He could turn the evidence over to
the Brotherhood once his contract was over and better and more capable
people than he could settle the Lani legal status But the inner voice
that had called him bestial now called him shirker coward and slacker
And this too could not be borne The case of the Lani would have to
be pursued as vigorously as he could do it They were entitled to human
rightswhether they wanted them or not

His first idea of making the spacer operational was a good one Kennon
decided as they finished the inspection of the ship Even if it was
never used it would make a good means of retreat He grinned wryly In a
guerrilla operation such as the one he was considering it would be wise
to have a way out if things got too hot The heavy parts the engines
and the controls were in workable condition and would merely require
cleaning and oiling Some of the optical equipment would have to be
replaced and fuel slugs would have to be obtained for the drivebut
none of these would be too hard to accomplish The slugs from any of the
power reactors on the island would serve nicely All that would have
to be done would be to modify the fuel ports on the ships engine The
spindizzy would have to be disassembled and checked and the main leads
embedded in timeresistant plastic would have to be examined The most
serious problem however wouldnt involve these things The control
board wiring and circuitry was where the trouble would lie Normal
insulation and printed circuitry wasnt designed to last for thousands
of years Each wired circuit would have to be removed duplicated and
replaced Every printed panel would have to be cleaned and receive a new
coat of insulating varnish Working full time a fourman electronics
team could do the job in a week Working parttime the two of them might
get it done in three months And the other jobs would take at least
another Add a month for errors in judgment lack of materials and
mistakesand another for unavoidable delaysit would be at least six
months before the Egg would be spaceworthy

Six months

Not too long if everything went well but far too long if there were
any mistakes He would have to be careful yet he must not give the
impression of being careful He shook his head Being a subversive was
going to require a greater amount of acting ability than he had ever
been called upon to display

And what of Copper How would she behave under the double strain of
knowledge that she was human and knowledge of the spaceship Women
werent noted for their tightlipped reticence Would she tell the other
Lani Would she crack under the pressure Did she have the qualities of
a good conspirator

As it turned out he didnt need to worry As a partner in crime Copper
was all that could be wished Everything was normal She was still
obedient helpful and gay as ever To watch her no one would ever
think that her bright head was full of knowledge that could rock Flora
to its foundations Never by look or word did she betray the slightest
trace of strain or guilt

And in her other moments she was ecstatic in her love and helpful with
the repair work on the Egg whenever Kennon could get time to visit the
old spaceship

You amaze me Kennon said as they eased the cover of the spindizzy
in place and spun the bolts on the lugs that held it to the outer
shielding He picked up a heavy wrench and began methodically to seat
the bolts as Copper wiped the white extrusion of the cover sealant from
the shining case

How

The way you hide your knowledge of this ship from the others I know
you better than anyone else on this island and yet you would fool me

We Lani are used to hiding things You men have been our masters for
centuries yet you do not know our redes Nor do you know what we think
We obey you but there are parts of us you do not own It is easy to
hide a little thing like this

Kennon nodded It figured He seated another bolt Three more and
the drive room would be restored and they could start on the control
circuits I wish you were as clever about adopting human customs as you
are about hiding guilty knowledge he said

Copper laughed You mean those silly things you have been teaching me
Why should I learn them Im happy as I am I love you you love me and
that is all that matters

Its not all that matters Cant you get it through your head that
civilized customs are necessary in a civilized society He gave the
nexttolast bolt an extravicious wrench Youll have to know them if
you expect to get along on Beta

But I will never see Beta

I am going there when my duty here is over And youre going with me

When will that be

Three years

So long Wellwe can think of it then but I dont think Man Alexander
will let you take me

Then I shall take you without his consent

She smiled It would be easier to stay here In another fifteen years I
will be old and you will not want me

Ill never do that Ill always want you

You swear too easily she said gently You men live forever We Lani
are a shortlived race

But you neednt be Its obviously

Its been tried my loveand those who were treated died Man
Alexander tried many years ago to make us longlived like you But he
failed You see he loved one of us too

But

Let us think no more of it Let us enjoy what we have and be grateful
to the Gods for the love we enjoyor do you have any Gods

One

Two are better More anyway And besides Ulf and Lyssa and the
GodEgg are responsible for our joy

They are indeed Kennon said

Then why should you think of leaving the place where they rule You
should stay here There will be other Lani when I am gone You will be
happy always

Not without you Kennon said Dont you understand that I love you

And I you But I am a Lani You are a man

Youre as human as I am Kennon said abruptly

That is what you say Copper replied I am not so sure I need more
proof than this She waved her hand at the ship

What proof do you need

The same as the proof you men require If I should have your child
then I would believe that I was human

Ive told you a thousand times that the radiation on this ship must
have affected Ulf and Lyssas germ plasm Cant you understand that

I can understand it all right but it does not change things Ulf and
Lyssa may have been human before they came here but they were not when
they landed They were Lani and their children were Lani

But they were of human stock

The law that lets men become our masters does not agree with you

Then the law is wrong It should be changed

Copper shrugged Two people cannot change a law

They can tryparticularly if the law is unjust

Copper sighed Is it not enough for us to love Must you try to run
through a wall

When the wall stands in the way of right and justice I must

Copper looked at him with pity in her green eyes This I do not
understand I know nothing of right and justice What are these things
Just words Yet you will endanger our happiness for them If it is my
happiness you wishthen leave this foolishness alone I have fifteen
years I can live with you before I am old and you tire of me With those
years I can be content

But I cant Kennon said Call me selfish if you wish but I want you
with me as long as I live I dont want to live my life without you

You want too much Copper said softly But if it makes you happy to
try to get it I shall help And if we do not succeed you will at least
be happier for trying And if you are happyshe shruggedthen the
rest makes little difference

That was the crux of the matter Kennon reflected bitterly He was
convinced she was human She was not And until her mind could be
changed on that point she would help him but her heart wouldnt be in
it And the only thing that would convince her that she was human would
be a childa child of his begetting He could perhaps trick her with
an artificial insemination of Lani sperm There were drugs that could
suspend consciousness hypnotics that would make her believe anything
she was told while under their influence

But in the end it would do no good All witnesses in Brotherhood court
actions were examined under psychoprobe and a hypnotic was of no value
against a lie detector that could extract the deepest buried truth
And he would be examined too The truth would outand nothing would be
gained In facteverything would be lost The attempt at trickery would
prejudice any court against the honest evidence they had so painfully
collected

He sighed The only thing to do was to go on as they wereand hope that
the evidence would hold With Betan legal talent at their back it
might And of course they could try to produce a child as nature had
intended They could trybut Kennon knew it would not succeed It never
had



CHAPTER XV

Copper had been acting strangely of late Kennon thought as he rolled
over in his bed and watched her standing before the fulllength mirror
on the bathroom door She pivoted slowly before the glass eying herself
critically raising her arms over her head holding them at her sides
flexing her supple spine and tightening muscles that moved like silken
cords beneath her golden skin

What are you trying to dobecome a muscle dancer Kennon asked idly

She whirled a crimson blush deepening the tan of her face You were
supposed to be asleep she said

Im an unregenerate heel he replied and I dont sleep too well
nowadays unless youre beside me

WellI suppose you might as well know now as later she said Youll
know in any event

Know what

That youre right I am human

And what brought on this sudden change of He stopped abruptly his
eyes widening

Yes Copper said I am with child Your child

But thats impossible

She shook her head Its a miracle perhaps but its not impossible
Its happened Cant you see the difference

See what You look just as you always do

I suppose you cant see it yet she admitted But I am with child
Im two weeks past my time

Kennons mind leaped to the obvious conclusion Pseudopregnancy He had
seen it before among Lani at Hillside Farm It was an odd syndrome
which occasionally occurred in humans and animals The brain desiring
children made demands upon the body and the body responded to its
desire by tricking the brain Lani were fairly subject to it probably
because they had better imaginations He would run a few tests when they
went down to the hospital and once she realized the practical joke her
body was playing everything would be all right No wonder she seemed
excited

Well find out about that later he said equably Well settle this
when we get back to the hospital

Copper smiled confidently and patted her stomach I know what you are
thinking but youre wrong We Lani know about these things In forty
generations I am the first to conceive as the Master intended

I hope you havent Kennon said with such bitter sincerity that Copper
looked at him wideeyed Not now Because if you have neither your
life nor mine is safe

Why

The Alexanders Do you think theyll take it lying down Were not
ready for them yet Theyll fight and the first thing theyll do is
kill you and erase me so we would never be able to talk You have been
declared an animal and you will not be allowed to change

What can we do Copper asked She shivered I do not want to die

Nor do I want you to Kennon said

I could tell the others

And just what would that accomplish

In a week every Lani on the island would know it There would be
revolt For the Lani would no longer be dependent upon Men to survive
Their greatest hold on us would be gone And we would be free again on
our island world

You would not Kennon said That sort of thinking is foolishness
Alexander would have men here within a week and a week after that you
would be smashed Dont you realize that there are thousands of millions
of men in the galaxyand to every one of them you would be animals You
know nothing about what you would face Your puny hundreds couldnt even
stand against a fraction of the power Alexander could mount against you
Have you seen a Burkholtz blaster work Have you seen remotecontrol
antipersonnel missiles Have you pushpull projectors atomic warheads
All of these weapons Alexander can command Dont you realize hes an
entrepreneurone of the most powerful men in this sector

Copper shook her head No she said in a small voice I know nothing
about these things

And do you think forty generations of absolute obedience to men can be
overcome because one Lani says she is pregnant by a man

Copper frowned You put that in a different way You talk as if it were
my belief rather than the truth

What is truth Kennon said heavily Who would believe you There are
hundreds of others with child

Sure youre human You know it I know it Ive been trying to convince
you for the past two months Youre just as human as I am But pray that
youre not pregnant We cant get out of here in less than four months
and by then everybody will know about you Someone will certainly check
the records And after that will come the psychoprobes Everything will
come to light The Egg will be destroyed I will be erased You will be
dead And that will be the end of it He looked down at her with an odd
expression of pity on his face You see he demanded harshly

Copper nodded I didnt understand she said Dont be angry with me
I shouldnt have told you I thought youd be happy

I was never angry with you but I am with myself I was stupid I
didnt figure on the remote possibility that we might be genetically
compatible I should have my head examined for putting you in such
danger However theres the possibilitythe probabilitythat your body
is playing a trick upon you

She shook her head You are wrong I am not mistaken I am with child
and the child is yours But the fault is no more yours than mine I
wanted you before you looked on me I still do and I do not feel at
fault That I am yours that my child is yours is a thing of wonder and
joy Never could I have expected so much

Kennon looked down at her smudged face streaked with the sudden
rivulets of tears and bitterness galled his throat Dear Godlet her
be wrong he prayed silently Let it be pseudopregnancy this time Let
the tests be negative

But they werent Unequivocally they confirmed Coppers diagnosis Here
was the proof he needed The final test that would prove the Lani human
And he had no way of getting it where it would do any good It would
take at least four months of steady labor before the ship was ready and
he didnt have that sort of time He was needed here and his prolonged
absence would cause suspicion and investigation Something would have to
be donebut what He couldnt take Copper off the island in an airboat
They were checked with microscopic care by Otpen Ones IFF A jeep
didnt have enough range to take them to the mainland And even if they
got there they couldnt get off the planet Alexander knew everything
that happened on Kardons two spaceports The Egg was the only way but
the Egg was unfinished and unspaceworthy

Frantically Kennon considered concealing Copper He shook his head It
wouldnt work It would be impossible to hide a baby on a place where
every birth was recorded Nor could one hide evidence of pregnancy in a
Lani Childbearing leaves telltale marks upon the body and Copper even
if she could be concealed for the duration of her pregnancy could never
survive the sharpeyed scrutiny of her fellows or the other humans
Questions would inevitably be asked

There had to be a solution He rubbed his forehead wearily It was
strange how so little a thing as the union of a spermatozoon and an ovum
could produce so much trouble He looked across the office at Copper
placidly filing case cards She wasnt worrying With sublime faith
she was sure that he would find the answer the one that would solve
everything He shuddered The only logical solution was abortionand
that was unthinkable He would not murder his childnor would Copper
permit it if he was capable of doing so

It was almost a relief when his phone rang and Blaloks voice came
cheerfully across the wire

Tried to get you about an hour ago the superintendent said but your
girl said you were busy

I was

You through now

Yes

Well get up to the fortress Alexander just flew in and hes calling a
meeting Something important has come up

Something important A wave of ice rattled down Kennons spine and then
he grinned feebly Alexander didnt know He couldnt know It had to be
something else

Ill be right up he said marveling at the calmness in his voice

Kennon couldnt help comparing this meeting with the one a year ago
The location was differentthe conference room in Alexandria was more
formal than Blaloks parlor but the same people were present Alexander
Blalok Jordan and himself Somehow Alexander seemed to have shrunk He
was no longer as impressive as he had been But the man still radiated
force even though it didnt seem quite so overpowering The year
Kennon thought had done much to build his selfconfidence He felt
assured rather than nervous

Good to see you Kennon Alexander said Reports say youre doing a
good job

I cant claim the credit Kennon said Eightyfive per cent of our
success is due to cooperation from the operating staff And thats
Blaloks doinghe knocked the heads of the division managers together
and they took care of their staffs Otherwise we could have had a bad
time

But you didnt Alexander said And you were the motive force

Ive darn near motivated myself out of a job Kennon said They
cooperate all too well nowadays

Which goes to prove that my theories on preventive medicine are right
Alexander said turning to Blalok

It looks that way Blalok admitted but that could be because you
picked a good man

Hes good in more ways than one Alexander said Or did he tell you
he saved Douglass life out on Otpen One

Hes never said a word

Alexander smiled Another point in his favor He knows how to keep his
mouth shut

Not when hes telling someone what to do about disease Jordon
interjected

Or telling someone off when they havent followed directions Blaiok
added

Better and better I was sure that he was the one we needed when we
first met

Kennon felt his ears turn flaming red

But thats not the reason I brought you here This isnt a Jac Kennon
admiration society I called you because I want to expand the Lani
breeding program

Why Jordan asked

Blalok stiffened You know my feeling about that sir Ive never liked
the idea of selling them If thats whats in your mind

Alexander shook his head Simmer down he said as he seated himself
at the head of the table Theres going to be no selling The Lani are
too valuable for that Well need them more than the money theyd bring
on the market You seeIve acquired a planet out on the periphery A
place called Phoebe One of our ships found it and I staked a discovery
claim on the major land mass and the crew made lesser claims that
covered all the available land Last month the Brotherhood allowed the
claims Last week the crewmen sold me their land Phoebes a lovely
placequite a bit like Floraand the ecological tests show its
capable of supporting mammalian life Just before I came here I sent
three shiploads of exterminators to clean it up and make it ready for
us It should be ready in two years

What sort of an ecology are you exterminating Jordan asked

Not that it makes any difference Alexander said but its mainly
reptilian Nothing over Group I Well restock with Floran animals

Jordan sighed Since thats the way it is it doesnt make any
difference he said But it could have The Lani are sensitive to
things like that If they thought that they were walking in over a pile
of bodies theyd do badly Itd be like Olympus all over again And we
couldnt keep them from knowing We talk and we forget but theyd tell
each otherand theyd remember

I know Alexander said somehow theyve never forgotten that
Grandfather trapped the last of the Lani males on Olympus

Jordan nodded They cant stand the place Thats why we had to abandon
the station

Does this new world have a moon Kennon asked abruptly

Yesin fact it has two

Habitable

Notheyre too small to hold air But men could live there in
domesbut why do youoh I see I hadnt considered that point
Alexanders hand darted to the phone beside him Get me Albertsville
he snapped Yes my officesI want Mr Oliver in purchasing and
contracting HelloWard Alexander here Yeseverythings fine I
have a job for youuse your scramblerpattern two Alexander
dialed the scrambler code on the second dial at the base of the phone
effectively preventing eavesdropping by beam tappers Yes he went on
Its Project Phoebe Have you secured title to the moons You havent
Wellyoud better do it before some of our competitors get bright
ideas Sure they know about the projectdo you think theyre stupid
Warren over at Consolidated practically told me that he was onto our
scheme So get title to those moons Since theyre uninhabitable and
within the planets primary field they come under the Spatial Debris Act
and you should be able to get Kardonian title without any great amount
of trouble Naturally we want themFor defensewhat else Well have
most of our eggs in that basket NoI dont know how we overlooked that
point But if it wasnt for a bright young man out here wed have left
ourselves wide open Now get crackingget that leak plugged Alexander
dropped the phone back in its cradle and sighed Wellthats buttoned
up he said Thanks Kennon

Kennon looked at Alexanders grinning face his own impassive but a
shattering certainty exploded in his mindAlexander was a telepath
That was his difference That was the thing that made him feared and
respected by his business associates It wouldnt have been enough on
the Central Worlds where men knew of sensitives and took precautions
against them But out here on the periphery it was a deadly advantage

So I gave it away Alexander said I suppose I was careless but your
thoughts about the moons shocked me

You practically told me once before when you hired me Kennon said
but I never realized it

You were too excited then

I wouldnt know Kennon said At any rate I didnt add the facts
correctly From somewhere deep in his memory an old quip came floating
to the surface An executive is a man who picks brainsothers
brains By that definition Alexander was an executive of the first
class Alexander chuckled

Suddenly Kennon wanted to run Panic flooded him What had he been
thinking about Had he thought oftwo times two are four four times
four are sixteen sixteen times sixteen arelets see six times
sixteen is ninetysix one times sixteen issix five carry
onetwotwo hundred fiftysix Two hundred fiftysix times

Whats eating you Alexander demanded

Im angry Kennon said I told you the conditions Id sign that
contract and you wrote a Peeper Clause into it And then you peep in
the worst way possible Theres no defense against a Telep unless
you know about him youve had my whole mind bare Youve violated my
personal privacy like no man has done before Sure Im mad I expected
honesty from youand you peep The anger was stronger nowa wave of
raw emotion based on a lifetime of training in mutual respect of a mans
privacya feeling intensified by his childhood environment of a crowded
planetary ecology and the cramped crew quarters on a spaceship To
Kennon Alexander had committed the ultimate sin

I can see I made a mistake by not telling you Alexander said His
voice was cold But you have no right to insult me

Im not saying it am I Kennon snapped The moonflower on the
bookcase behind Alexander was a thing of beauty Alexander liked beauty
He had said so and the Great Hall below them bore it out It was a
lovely room Those four bronze Lani in the fountain were works of art
One of them looked remarkably like Copper Copper in bronze The little
witch had probably posed for the casting Maybe it had even been made
from her body

Theyre all of Susy Alexander said I can see why you are angry and
I dont blame you But remember I warned you about Lani

CopperKennon wrenched his thoughts back to the moonflower It had
twelve petals limpid white on the borders shading to deep blue in the
centerfrom which the creamcolored stamen surrounded by transparent
pistils sprang to burst into a golden glory of pollen that dripped
in tiny yellow flecks to the broad petals below It was a magnificent
flower There was nothing like it on Beta That was a marvelous thing
about flowerswherever one went in the universe plants used the same
methods to fertilize their seed and spread their germ plasm It was too
bad thatKennon jerked his attention to Alexanders face He detested
the thought that his mind was common property A man should have
something he can call his own There had been a clinics instructor
in Year Six who was a sensitive The classes had protected themselves
against his prying with a circleta thought screenhe had done it too
Maybe he had brought the circlet with him If he did no one was going
to catch him without it It was a dirty business this reading of
others thought Now where had he put that circlet Was it among his old
booksor was it with his instruments

Why dont you go back to your house and find it Alexander snapped
As you are youre nothing but a disruption I want you in on this
meeting but not the way youre acting

Im not going to act any other way until I get some protection from
peeping Kennon said grimly And if you think this is bad wait till I
start going through comparative anatomy

Whats the matter with you two Blalok asked

Be quiet Alexander snapped This isnt your problem Kennon is
behaving like a spoiled child

Hes a telepath Kennon said And he didnt tell me

So what Ive known that for years

And you stand for it

Im a Mystic not a Betan Blalok said I dont have your insane
desire for privacy

Go find that thought screen if you still have it Alexander said I
dont want any more of this Youre making me ill

Kennon grinned thinly as he rose to his feet It was a good thing he
remembered Alexander was squeamish and didnt like anatomy The door
was to his left an iris door with eight leavesterribly oldfashioned
About ten steps away Count themonetwothree

Alexander sighed as Kennon left the room I certainly pushed the panic
button on that young man he said He has a pathological attitude
toward telepathy Wonder what he has to hide that he wants privacy so
badly Even for a Betan this reaction was violent

Oh I dont know Hes a pretty emotional sort Maybe he hates to look
like a fool Hes gotten himself mixed up with one of the Lani Cute
little thing by the name of Copper Blalok said

Ohthats it I thought that was what he was hiding A picture of
a girl kept popping up Alexander chuckled I suppose thats the
trouble A man hardly likes to look a fool particularly to someone
who has warned him At that I dont blame him They are beautiful and
affectionate And even with their superstitions and tabus theyre better
than most humans

For pets Blalok said heavily

Theyre not better at anything Jordan demurred They cant beman
is the best and always will be

The eternal racial chauvinist Alexander murmured He turned his
attention to Blalok But for awhile Evald Id suggest you keep an
eye on our young man I still dont like his reaction It was too
violenttoo defensive I dont feel right about it Perhaps Betans are
more sensitive than most people but it seems to me that hes trying
to conceal something There was an undertone of fearand something
elsebeneath his defenses

Couldnt you get any more than that Blalok asked Youre pretty good
at this mindreading business

His defenses were remarkably good Alexander said dryly

  

Well hed done it now Kennon thought He found the thoughtscreen
circlet sandwiched between two books on comparative neuroanatomy which
he hadnt bothered to unpack He slipped it on and connected the lead
wires to a portable battery pack There was a halfforgotten tingling
as the weak field heterodyned his thought waves Kennon sighed If
Alexander wasnt suspicious of him now the man was a fool Hed done as
well as he could with confusion and outrage but it was hardly possible
to hide behind superficialities Even the most disciplined mind couldnt
do that without some preparation Undoubtedly his concern about Copper
had leaked through He could only hope that other and more important
things had not

Wellhe could go back to the conference now but he would have to be
doubly careful from now on He couldnt make daily trips to Olympus His
reaction had killed that plan Alexander would be suspicious nowand
unusual actions would crystallize suspicion to certainty Now he needed
a reason to be in that area And then he grinned He had a reasona
good oneone that would fit in with Alexanders plans and his own
The only problem would be to make Alexander buy itand that might be
difficult Hed have to work carefullybut with normal luck he could
put the idea across He crossed his fingers as he trudged back up the
path to Alexandria

The conference dragged on Unlike most meetings this one accomplished
thingswhich was a tribute to Alexanders ability to keep the subject
in hand Details of the expansion program presented by Alexander were
rapidly reduced to workable plans They involved some rearrangement of
existing facilities and the construction of others But the obvious
snags were rapidly disposed of and the whole revamped operation was
outlined on paper in surprisingly few hours A deadline date was set
construction was authorized and in the morning the first steps in the
practical implementation of the new program would be taken

Well thats that Alexander said with a sigh I think this calls for
a drink

Theres one more thing Kennon said I know it isnt much but
Jordans remark started me thinking

What remark Jordan asked

The one you made at the beginning about Phoebe possibly being like the
Olympus Station Ive often wondered why that particular location has
been so difficult to operate Sure I know the accepted explanation
but I think we should learn why it works and how to break a tabu If we
dont we might be in for trouble

Thats a good thought Alexander said I tried to find out once but
all I could discover was that it was tabu The Lani simply didnt like
it And despite the fact that I can read minds I didnt learn any more
than that Theres a certain sexlinkage to telepathy as you probably
know

Kennon nodded

All I could discover was that their dislike of Olympus was a basic
emotion rather than reasoned thought They were nervous irritable
disobedient and uncooperative while they were thereand even they
didnt know why It was merely tabu We even tried youngstersbut the
attitude was the same Id like to know more about that basic emotion

We should understand it Kennon agreed If we transship a large
number of Lani to a strange world we should know their deepest
motivations We cannot take the chance that the transplant wont take
with all the money youre sinking into this project

You have a point there Have you any suggestions about how to
accomplish this Alexanders voice was interested

I have Hire a psychologist And reopen Olympus

Itll be the same story Jordan said

Not if you apply experimental procedure Kennon said Divide the
place into a number of separate units in which groups ofsay tenLani
of various ages are kept Let every group know where they are but dont
let them come in contact with one another Observe them constantly Put
spy cells in the units Couple them to recorders Prepare a set of test
situations and observe how each group performs Question individuals
under narcosynthesis Observe and record any changes in physical
conditiongive them the works Maybe we can collect some basic data
that will indicate the answer

Not a bad idea Alexander said

I dont like it Jordan said It sounds cumbersome

It is Kennon agreed But it may save a great deal of trouble later

I think youre right Kennon Blalok said We should know everything
we can

What would you do first if you were heading this program Alexander
asked He eyed Kennon critically

Nothing Kennon said promptly Im not qualified to run an
investigation like this You need a specialist I am a practitioner

Hmmbut you know experimental procedure

Naturallybut I do not have the training to prepare a program or
evaluate its results The only thing I could do would be to check the
physical condition of the experimental groups

Could you set up the physical facilities Alexander asked

PossiblyId need a set of plans of the station and I couldnt
guarantee that the specialist wouldnt want to make changes But the
physical arrangements should be simple enough to construct

How long would it take you to prepare a plan

I could have it by tomorrow or perhaps a day later

If you can do it by then Ill stay over Id like to examine this
proposal more closely It has merit Thats the second constructive
suggestion youve made tonight Despite your peculiar desire for
privacy Im glad you came back Alexander smiled

Kennon smiled back Apparently the entrepreneur had taken the bait
But it was too early to tell whether he had swallowed it without
reservation It all depended upon how much had been given away before
he had discovered that Alexander was a telepath Perhaps Alexander was
merely leading him on There were too many intangibles and there was no
way of predicting how it would turn out But he felt mildly optimistic

Alexander closed the meeting and Kennon left promptly He had a good
excuse There was plenty of work to do if he was going to prepare an
adequate plan for utilizing Olympus Station Jordan went with him
but Blalok stayed behind It was natural enough Blalok was the
administrator but Kennon felt uneasy Nor would he have felt any better
if he could have heard what went on after he left

Alexander looked quizzically at Blalok after the door closed behind the
two men

Well Evald what do you think Does it strike you that Kennons
sincereor does it sound as though he has something up his sleeve

If he does Blalok said I dont know what it could be I wouldnt
take a job on Olympus if you gave it to me

If he doesnt know about the place Alexander said thoughtfully its
probable that his suggestion was honest I think it is but Im not sure
He worries me now that I cant read him I think Ill send Douglas back
here to watch him

Why In my book thatd be a poor choice After all you said Kennon
saved his life He should be grateful

You dont know Douglas Alexander said He hates Kennons guts for
what he did

What did he do

He made Douglas feel inferior And theres no surer way to gain my
cousins undying enmity Alexander laughed I know he said Hed
like to kill me too

Blalok shrugged

But in the meantime I want you to keep an eye on Kennon If his outline
is all right Im going to authorize him to set up this experiment I
want to give him every possible chance I like himand hes done good
work I wouldnt want him to feel that I distrust him

Which you do of course Blalok said dryly

Alexander smiled Actually he said with equal dryness I distrust
everyone



CHAPTER XVI

If you think this job is easy you have another think coming Kennon
said bitterly I hired out as a veterinarian not as a nursemaid for
a bunch of psychoneurotic humans and superstitious Lani The place is
jinxed they tell meHa Jinxed Sure its jinxed What job wouldnt
be with a bunch of goofballs like these Ive got working on it

I cant keep a Lani here for two weeks without having her throw a
catfit and the superstitious idiots are affecting the menwho ought to
know better I wish Id never have opened my big mouth to Alexander As
far as Im concerned he can take this job and

Heytake it easy man Blalok said Youre heading straight for a
nervous breakdown

And why shouldnt I Kennon asked Nothing goes right Theres always
trouble I order materialsthey dont arrive Theres worker trouble
equipment trouble installation trouble Everybodys cutting corners
trying to get done faster and away soonerand all they do is mess up
work that should have been done right the first time We should have
been finished last week but we have another week to go at least unless
some bumblefingered beanbrain gets another bright idea that sets us
back again Im sick to death of it

I know I know Blalok said soothingly and Im sorry

Sorry What good is that You and Jordan come up here in relays Just
what do you think youll find Or has Alexander dragged you into keeping
an eye on me because I dont like someone snooping inside my skull

Its not that Blalok said Its just

Oh dont make excuses You know and I know the Bossman is
suspicious Kennon shrugged Normally I wouldnt blame him but its
a damned nuisance with things the way they are All we have is one more
bay and a hall to finishbut if

Now wait a minute Blalok said Get the kink out of your neck and
simmer down Surethe Bossman told us to keep an eye on youbut
thats not why Im here this time

Well

Douglas came back this morning

What for

I dont know Blaloks face wore the noncommittal look it always wore
when he was taking liberties with the truth

Youre probably the worst liar in the galaxy Kennon chuckled Hes
here to breathe down my neck isnt he

Blalok nodded

Keep him off my back for another week and he can breathe all he wants
to Ill be done then

I cant promise a thing

Kennon shrugged Its too much to ask I guess

But I can try Blalok added

Thats enough for me Kennon grinned Has he turned Alexandria into a
shambles yet

Not yet but everyones uneasy

I cant blame them That young fellows undiluted poison By the way
how does he look

About the same

The medics must have done a good job Kennon said

The Bossman shipped him to Beta for treatment Blalok said He
didnt trust the docs out here

That figures At any rate Douglas couldnt have gone to a better
place

What happened to him

He stuck his nose where he shouldnt Kennon said pointedly

Blalok stiffened

Im sorry Evald Even if you knew I couldnt talk about it What I
know about Douglas is classified

WellDouglas is doing plenty of talking Claims his stay in the
hospital was all your fault

Kennon shrugged Thats his opinion And as long as he stays out of my
way hes welcome to it

Blalok looked at Kennons haggard face with mild concern Doc he
said youd better take it easy Youre going to pieces

Ill be through here in another week Ill have this all wrapped up

Providing youre not wrapped up first

Eh

In a shroud You look like a walking corpse

Kennon chuckled wearily Sometimes I feel like one But Id like to get
this job finished

Well Ill do what I can Blalok said Ill try to keep him down at
Alexandria for a few days

Itll be enough Kennon said More than enoughhe added mentally
The coils of fuel wire were ready to load and the power slugs for the
ships reactor were already stored in the power plant building here at
Olympus Three more days and the old spacer would be as ready to fly as
she would ever be And after that it was in the lap of fate

He ushered Blalok to his jeep and watched until he disappeared

Im getting to be a firstclass liar he remarked wryly to himself
as he turned back to the temporary quarters he was occupying at the
station And the bad thing about it is that Im actually enjoying it

A few weeks ago an admission like that would have been inconceivable
It was odd he thought how one thing led to another and produced an
end that could not be foreseen Now he could lie and dissemble with the
best He had no compunction about falsifying a requisition or stealing
what he could not obtain with apparent honesty His character had sunk
to an alltime low he reflected with grim humor as he walked into the
shadow of the main building Neither Blaloks nor Jordans frequent
visits bothered him Both men were creatures of habit and both were
married They stayed home at nightand it was nighttime that he worked
on the spacer The project afforded him a perfect cover and it was only
minutes by jeep away from the crater

Even so the double duty was an appalling task And it would have been
impossible if it wasnt for Copper Her quick fingers keen eyesight
and uncanny memory made the work seem simple and neither the
tediousness of repairing miles of circuitry nor the depressing
environment of Olympus Station seemed to bother her While he worked
with the men on the project she restored and reassembled circuits in
his quarters and at night they replaced them in the old ship And the
GodEgg was rapidly becoming operational

Kennon wondered what it was about Copper that made her so different from
the rest Olympus didnt bother her at all In fact she seemed to thrive
on the depressing atmosphere that filled the Station Perhaps it was
because she had violated the tabu about the GodEgg so often that
ordinary superstition had no effect upon her He shrugged He had
troubles enough without worrying about Coppers motivations and not the
least of these was taking the GodEgg into space

Kennon looked forward to blastoff with distinct misgivings There was
too much about the ancient spacer that was strangeand too much that
was terrifying

Basically the ship was an ionjet job with atomic primaries and a
spindizzy converter that might possibly take her up as high as middle
yellow Cthfar enough to give her a good turn of speed but not enough
to compensate for timelag Her screens were monstrosities double
polyphase lattices that looked about as spacetight as so many sieves
There were no acceleration dampers no temporal compensators no
autopilot no fourspace computer and the primaries operated on nuclear
rather than binding energy The control chairs werent equipped with
forcefields but instead had incredibly primitive safety webs that held
one in place by sheer tensile strength Taking a ship like that into
space was an open invitation to suicide A man needed a combination of
foolhardy bravery and incredible fatalism to blast off in a can like
this He had the stimulus but the knowledge of what he would face
troubled him more than he cared to admit More and more as he
understood the ship he was amazed at the courage of the ancients who
had blithely leaped into hyperspace in these flying coffins with no more
motivation than to see what was beyond the nearest star And in ships
more primitive than this men had swept through the star systems nearest
Earth in the outward expansion of the First Millennium

He sighed The breed of man must have been tough in the old daysand
hed soon be finding out if any of that ancient toughness remained

He opened the door to his quarters

Copper was sitting in his favorite chair a pile of completed assemblies
neatly stacked beside her and a disorderly file of crumpled cloth at
her feet Her face was sullen as she looked up at him Ive had about
all of this Im going to take she said mutinously as she stirred the
heap of cloth with a bare foot Not even you are going to make me wear
thosethings

Kennon sighed It was the same old story For months he had been trying
patiently to indoctrinate Copper with a minimum of civilized habits but
she was quite literally a savage In her entire lifetime she had never
worn clothing and to encase her body in hose kilts blouse and
sandals was a form of torture She scratched wiggled and twisted at
the garments until she looked as bad as she felt and would usually
finish a session by tearing off the offending clothes and sulking She
was doing it now

You must act like a civilized human being Kennon said mildly Youre
simply going to have to learn to wear these clothes properly

Why Im more comfortable as I am

Thats not the point You are going to be living in human society and
you must act human The only planet where you could get away with nudity
is Santos and were not going there

Why not

Ive explained it time and again Well have to go to Beta Thats the
only place I know where youll have a fair hearing And on Beta people
wear clothes They have to Its cold even in summer and in the
wintertime theres snow

Whats snow

Ice crystals that fall like rain but Ive told you this before

And I still dont believe it

Believe it or not youre going to wear those things Now put them on

She looked at him with mutiny on her face All right slave driver
she muttered as she picked up the clothing but I hope youll itch
someday and be unable to scratch

And try to wear those garments more gracefully You make them look like
a sack

They feel like one I keep thinking that all I need is a tag around my
neck

You havent much time to get used to them Kennon said Were leaving
this week

So soon

Yesand youll wear those things to the ship into the ship and all
the time were on the ship Youll keep wearing clothing until it looks
right

Slave driver Copper hissed

Slave Kennon answered equably

Copper giggled The sound was utterly unexpected and completely
incongruous That was the wonder of her Kennon reflected Her mercurial
temperament made life something that was continually exciting She was a
neverending delight



CHAPTER XVII

It was the last trip Kennon loaded the jeep with the lastminute items
he would need The four reactor cores in their lead cases went aboard
last and were packed inside a pile of leadblock shielding

He helped Copper in and looked back without regret as the bulk of
Olympus Station vanished below him in the dusk The last of the work
crew had left that afternoon The station was ready for occupancy
His assignment had been completed He felt an odd pleasure at having
finished the job Alexander might not be happy about his subsequent
actions but he could have no complaint about what he did while he was
here

Wellsay goodbye to Flora he said to Copper

I dont want to she said I dont want to leave

You cant stay You know that

She nodded But that doesnt make me any less regretful

Regretful

All rightscared Were going to try to make the GodEgg fly again
Not only is it sacrilege but as youve often said its dangerous I
have no desire to die

You have two courses

I knowyouve pointed them out often enough Copper said And since
you decided to go Id go with you even though I knew the Egg would blow
up

Youre quite a girl Kennon said admiringly Did I ever tell you that
I love you

Not nearly often enough Copper said You could do it every day and
Id never get tired of hearing it

The jeep settled over the lava wall Well leave it in the passageway
when were through Kennon said Maybe it will survive blastoff

Why worry about it Copper asked

I hate destroying anything needlessly Kennon said

And since we have plenty of time we might as well be neat about our
departure

He was wrong of course but he didnt know that

  

Douglas Alexander checked the radarscope and whistled in surprise at
the picture it revealed So thats where hes going he said softly
to himself Cousin Alex was right as usual He grimaced unpleasantly
Hes up to somethingthats for sure His face twisted into an
expression that was half sneer half triumph This is going to be
fun He moved the control and his airboat hovering silently at five
thousand meters dropped toward the ground in free fall as Douglas
loosened the Burkholtz in the holster at his waist But what is he
doing he muttered The question hung unanswered in the still air of
the cabin as the airboat dropped downward

Douglas hadnt been impressed with Blaloks attempt at a delaying
action Normally he might have been but his fear of his cousin was
greater than his respect for Blalok The superintendent had only
succeeded in accomplishing something he had not intended when he had
tried to dissuade Douglas from visiting Kennon He had made Douglas
cautious The airboat and longrange surveillance had been the result
For the past two nights Douglas had hung over Olympus Station checking
the placeto leave at dawn when the new days work began For two
nights Kennon had been lucky He had departed for the Egg shortly before
Douglas took up his station and had returned after the watcher had
called it a night and had returned home But this last night Kennon
left lateand his departure was noted

Wonder whos the girl with him Douglas said as the boat plunged down
Well Ill be finding out in a minute

Kennons head jerked upward at the sound of air whistling past the
airboats hull and a wave of icy coldness swept through his chest
There was no question that he was discovered His shoulders sagged

Wellit was a good try he said bitterly as Copper looked at him with
sudden terror on her face

I dont want to die she wailed

You wontnot if I can help it Kennon said Move away from
mequickly

But

Do as I say Kennons voice was sharp And keep that hood over your
face

The airboat settled softly on the ash in front of him the door snapped
open and Douglas dropped to the ground Burkholtz jutting from his pudgy
fist

My my Douglas said what have we here Dr Kennon and a woman
I thought better of you than that Doctor And all dressed up in
antiradiation suits This is interesting Just what are you doing up
here on the mountain so late at nightprospecting

You might call it that Kennon said His body sagged with relief
Douglas thank Ochsner it was Douglas He was running true to
formtalking when he should have been shooting

Douglas jerked his head toward Copper standing a few feet to his left
Who is she

None of your business Kennon snapped hoping that his outburst
covered Coppers gasp of surprise and fear and knowing that it didnt

Im making it my business Theres something funny going on around
here

Kennon blinked Could it be that Douglas didnt know Had he been
watching them on radar Durilium was radartransparent It absorbed
and dissipated electromagnetic waves rather than reflecting them For a
second he felt a tiny surge of hope

Stand where you are Douglas said as he stepped over to the
halfparalyzed Copper and jerked the hood back from her face For a
moment he looked puzzled Just who are you he demanded I dont
recall seeing you before And then recognition dawned Old Docs
Lani he gasped

She works for me now Kennon said

Douglas laughed It wasnt a nice sound All dressed up he asked
Nice work

Thats my fault Kennon said

You know the rules Douglas said I could blast you both

Go ahead Kennon said but if you do youll never find out what
were doing up here

Douglas hesitated Kennons voice was flat and filled with utter
conviction

Theres a reason why Coppers wearing that suit Kennon continued
and you wont know that either

The Burkholtz swiveled around to point at Kennons belly Ive had
about enough of this Lets have it Tell me what youre doing here

Ill do better than that Kennon said promptly Ill show you Youll
be surprised at what weve uncovered He made his muscles relax and
forced himself to speak naturally Copper he noted was still rigid
with terror The Alexandersany of themwere everything he had said
they were They were the masters here And despite Coppers boast she
was as susceptible to their influence as any other Lani

All right Douglas said show me this thing Id never be able to
find without your help He half turned to Copper Stay where you are
Lani he said Dont move until I come back

Yes Man Douglas Copper replied Her voice was flat colorless and
submissive

Kennon shuddered He had never heard precisely that tone from her
before One word from Douglas and she had become a zombiea mindless
muscle preparation that existed only to obey Anger filled himanger
that one he loved could be ordered by someone who wasnt worth a
third of heranger that she obeyedanger at his own impotence and
frustration It wasnt a clean anger It was a dark redsplashed thing
that struggled and writhed inside him a fierce unreasoning rage that
seethed and bubbled yet could not break free For an instant with
blinding clarity Kennon understood the feelings of the caged male Lani
on Otpen One And he sympathized

Follow me he said and started around the ship

Staynogo ahead Douglas said but remember Im right behind
you

Kennon walked straight up to the pit and pointed down at the dark bulk
of the Egg concealed in the shadows of the bottom

Thats it he said

What I dont see anything Douglas said suspiciously

HereIll shine a light Kennon reached for his belt

No you dont I know that trick Youre not going to blind me Take
that torch loose carefullythats itnow hand it to me Douglas hand
closed over the smooth plastic Cautiously he turned on the beam and
directed it downward

A spacer he gasped How did that get here He leaned forward to
look into the pit as a dark shadow materialized behind him

Kennon choked back the involuntary cry of warning that rose in his
throat Copper His muscles tensed as her arm came up and downa
shadow almost invisible in the starlight The leaning figure of Douglas
collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been suddenly released The
torch dropped from his hand and went bouncing and winking down the wall
of the pit followed by Douglasa limp bundle of arms and legs that
rotated grotesquely as he disappeared down the slope Starlight gleamed
on the Burkholtz lying on the lip of the crater where it had fallen
from his hand

I told you that not even Man Alexander could order me since I gave my
love to you Copper said smugly as she peered over the edge of the pit
a chunk of lava gripped in one small capable hand Maybe this proves
it

Douglas isnt Alexander Kennon said slowly as he picked up the
blaster but I believe you

Didnt I act convincingly she said brightly

Very he said You fooled me completely

The important thing was that I fooled Douglas

You did that all right Now lets get him out of that pit

Why

The jet blast will fry him when we take off

What difference would that make

I told you Kennon said that I never destroy things
unnecessarilynot even things like Douglas

But he would have destroyed you

Thats no excuse for murder Now go back to the jeep and fetch a rope
Ill go down and get him out

Do we have to bother with him Copper asked and then shrugged It
was an eloquent gesture expressing disgust resignation and unwilling
compliance in one lift of smoothly muscled shoulders

Theres no question about it Kennon said Youre becoming more human
every day

He chuckled as he slid over the edge of the pit following the path
Douglas had taken a moment before He found him sitting on a pile of
ashes shaking his head

What happened Douglas asked querulously There was fear in his voice

Copper hit you on the head with a rock Kennon said as he bent over
and retrieved the torch still burning near Douglas feet

The Lani Douglas voice was incredulous

Not a Lani Kennon corrected Shes as human as you or I

Thats a lie Douglas said

Maybe this spacers a lie too Her ancestors came in ita pair
of humans named Alfred and Melissa Weygand They were Christian
missionaries from a planet called Heaven out in Ophiuchus Sector Went
out to convert aliens and landed here when their fuel ran out
Kennon paused That was about four millennia ago Their descendants
naturally reverted to barbarism in a few generations but theres
enough evidence in the ship to prove that the Lani were their
children

But the tailsthe differencesthe failure of the test Douglas said

Mutation Kennon replied Those old spindizzy converters werent
too choosy about how they scattered radiation And they had come a long
way He paused looking down at Douglas feeling a twinge of pity for
the man His world was crumbling And there was no other human blood
available to filter out their peculiarities It might have been done
during the first couple of generations but constant inbreeding fixed
the genetic pattern

How did you discover this Douglas asked

Accident Kennon said briefly

Youll never be able to prove theyre human Douglas said

The ships log will do that

Not without a humanity testthey cant pass that

Sorry to disappoint you Your grandfather used the wrong sort of sperm
Now if there had been a Betan in the crew

You mean shes pregnant

Kennon nodded Theres been mutation on Beta he said And its
apparently a similar one to hers BetanLani matings are fertile

Douglass shoulders sagged and then straightened I dont believe it
he said Youre just a damned sneaking spy Somehow or other you got
a spacer in here after you wormed your way into Cousin Alexs
confidenceand now youre going to space out with the nucleus of a new
farm Just wait When Alex learns of this the galaxyll be too small to
hold you

Dont babble like a fool Kennon said with disgust How could I land
a spacer here without being spotted You sound like a twocredit novel
And even if I didwould it be a can like this Kennon played the torch
over the blueblack durilium protruding from the ashes

Douglas eyes widened as he took in the details of construction What
an antique he blurted Where did you get this can

I found it here

Tell me another one

You wont believe Kennon said flatly because you dont dare
believe You have a mental block Youve killed maimed tortured
treated them like animalsand now your mind shrinks from admitting
theyre human You know what will happen if the old court decision is
reversed It will wreck your little empire dry up your money break
youand you cant stand the thought of that You dont dare let us
leave yet you cant stop us because I have your blaster and Id just
as soon shoot you as look at your rotten face Now get on your feet and
start climbing if you want to stay alive Were getting out of here and
youll fry inside this pit

Where are you taking me

Back to your airboat Im going to tie you up and set you off on
autopilot Youll be able to get loose quickly enough but itll be too
late to stop us Well be gone and you can think of how youll manage
to face the human race

I hope you blow yourself and that antique clear out of space

We might But youll never know for sure But mark thisif I live Ill
be back with the Brotherhood You can count on it

They struggled up the side of the pit and halted panting on the rim
How much radiation was down there Douglas asked worriedly

Not enough to hurt you

Thats good Douglas accepted the statement at face value a fact
which failed to surprise Kennon You know he said Ive been around
Lani all my life And I know that theyre not human No selfrespecting
human would take a tenth of what they put up with

Their ancestors didnt Kennon said They fought to the end But your
Grandfather was a smart man even though he was a Degrader

He wasnt Douglas exploded No Alexander is a Degrader

He realized Kennon went on that hed never succeed in enslaving the
Lani unless he separated the sexes And since women are more subjective
in their outlookand more pliablehe picked them for his slaves The
males he retired to stud Probably the fact that there were more women
than men helped him make up his mind

In every society Kennon went on inexorably there are potential
freeman and potential slaves The latter invariably outnumber the
former Theyre cowards the timid the unsacrificingthe ones that
want peace at any pricethe ones who will trade freedom for security
Those were the ones who hid rather than risk their lives fighting
the aggressor Those were the ones who survived Old Alexander had a
readymade slave cadre when he finished off the last of the warriors
For four centuries the survivors have been bred and selected to
perpetuate slave traits And the system works The men dont want
freedomthey want liberty to kill each other The women dont want
freedomthey want males And theyd serve them precisely as the Sarkian
women serve their menfolk Youve killed any chance they had to become
a civilization Its going to take generations perhaps before theyre
reoriented Theres plenty you Alexanders should answer for

If theres any fault its yours Douglas snarled We were doing all
right until you came here Wed still be doing all right if I had shot
you both His shoulders sagged I should have killed you when I had
the chance he said bitterly

But you didnt Kennon said and to show my gratitude Im letting you
get away with a whole skin I dont expect you to be grateful but at
least youll not be on my conscience I dont enjoy killing not even
things like you

Douglas sneered Youre softa soft sentimental fool

Admitted Kennon said but thats my nature

Yet youd destroy the family wreck Outworld Enterprises and throw a
whole world into chaos over a few thousand animals I dont understand
you

Theyre human Kennon said flatly

Admitting they might once have been theyre not now

And whose fault is that

Not ours Douglas said promptly If there is any fault its that of
the court who decided they were humanoid

You didnt help any

Why should we Does one treat a shrake like a brotheror a varlor
a dog We treat them like the animals they are And weve done no worse
with the Lani Our consciences are clear

Kennon laughed humorlessly Yet this clear conscience makes you want
to kill me so you can keep on treating them as animalseven though you
know theyre human

I know nothing of the sort But youre right about the killing Id
kill you cheerfully if I had the chance Its our necks if you get away
with this Of course you probably wont but why take the chance I
like my neck more than I like yours

Youre honest at any rate Kennon admitted And in a way I dont
blame you To you its probably better to be a rich slaver living off
the legacy of a Degrader than a penniless humanitarian But youve lost
your chance

Douglas screamed with rage He whirled on Kennon his face a distorted
mask of hate

Hold it Kennon barked I dont want to kill you but Ill burn a
hole clear through your rotten carcass if you make another move I have
no love for your kind

Douglas spat contemptuously You havent got the guts he snarled But
he didnt move

Just stand stillvery still Kennon said softly The iron in his
voice was not hidden by the quiet tone

Douglas shivered Ill get you yet he said but there was no force in
the threat

Heres the rope you wanted Copper said as she emerged abruptly from
the darkness I had a hard time finding it

You havent been too long Kennon said Now tie Douglas hands behind
him while I keep him covered

Its a pleasure Copper murmured



CHAPTER XVIII

Im frightened Copper said twisting uncomfortably in the shock chair
beside Kennons

After you have been so brave Kennon asked Thats nonsense Its
just nervous reaction Now web in like I showed you Its time for
blastoff We dont dare wait much longer

All rightbut I have a feeling that this isnt right Something is
going to go wrong

I hope you dont have precognition Kennon smiled Ive checked
everything The ship is as good as shell ever be Theres nothing more
that we can do

Theres one consolation Copper said wanly At well die together

Theres a better chance that well live together

I hope so

Ready Kennon asked

She nodded

He flipped the switches that would send the fuel rods into the reactor
Below them a soft barely audible whine ascended the sonic scale to
a point of irritating inaudibility Kennon smiled The spindizzy was
functioning properly He flipped a second bank of switches and a dull
roar came from the buried stem Ashes and pumice heated to incandescence
were blown through the air Molten drops of radioactive lava skittered
across the durilium hull as Kennon advanced the power The whole stem
of the ship was immersed in a seething lake of bolling rock as the Egg
lifted slowly with ponderous dignity into the night sky

Hang on Kennon said Im going to hyper His hand moved a red lever
and the Egg shimmered and vanished with a peculiar wrenching motion
into an impossible direction that the mind could not grasp And the
interceptor missile from Otpen One nosed through the space the Egg had
occupied

  

We made it Kennon said looking across the writhing semifluid control
board shifting oddly in the harsh yellow monochromatic light that
pervaded the cabin The screens were leaking like sieves but they were
holding well enough to keep Cth yellow from being anything more than an
annoyance He glanced over at Copper a fantastically elongated Copper
who looked like a madmans dream of chaos

And Copper screamed The sound echoed and reechoed dying away with a
lingering discordant reverberation that made his skin tingle

Copper Its all right Its all right Stop it

Copper screamed again and her elongated figure suddenly foreshortened
and collapsed into a small writhing ball from which two small pink hands
emerged clutching at a gelid mass of air that flowed sluggishly around
them

And Kennon knew what he had forgotten Hyperspace with leaky screens was
nothing to inflict upon an unprepared mind It is one thing to endure
partial exposure after months of training with experienced medics
standing by to help you through the shock phase but quite another to
be thrust from a safe and sheltered existence into the mind shattering
distortions of the Cth continuum

The Egg was old Her screens never good at best were hardly more than
filters Through the hull through the drive lattice the viciously
distorted Cth environment seeped into the ship turning prosaic shapes
of controls and instruments into writhing masses of obscene horror that
sent extensions wiggling off into nothingness at eyeaching angles A
spaceman could take thisknowing it wasnt realbut a tyro could not

Copper collapsed Her mind assaulted by sensations no untrained person
should experience went into shock But she wasnt granted the mercy
of unconsciousness Terrified by a pseudo reality that surpassed her
wildest nightmares she stared wideeyed at the control room and the
thing that had been Kennon She screamed until her throat was raw
until the monster beside her touched her with Kennons hands Then
mercifully she felt a stinging in her arm and all sensation ceased

Kennon stared glumly at the controls Fleming alone knew how many
objective years were passing outside as they hurtled through fourspace
Subjectively it would only be hours aboard the Egg but a decadeor
maybe a centurymight pass outside this mad universe where neither time
nor speed had meaning The old ships didnt have temporal compensators
nor could they travel through upper bands of Cth where subjective
and objective time were more nearly equal They were trapped in
a semistasis of time as the ship fled on through the distorted
monochromatic regions that bypassed normal space

The Egg slipped smoothly out of the hyper jump back into the normal
universe Beta floated above them the blue shield of her atmosphere
shining softly in the light of Betas sun

Couldnt hit it that good again in a hundred tries Kennon gloated
Halfway across the galaxyand right on the nose He looked at the
shock chair beside him Copper was curled into a tight ball inside the
confining safety web knees drawn up back bent head downarms wrapped
protectingly around her legsthe fetal position of catatonic shock

He shook her shoulderno response Her pulse was thready and irregular
Her breathing was shallow Her lips were blue Her condition was
obviousspace shockextreme grade Shed need medical attention if she
was going to live And shed need it fast

Just why you educated nitwit he snarled at himself didnt you have
sense enough to give her that injection of Sonmol before we hypered You
havent the sense of a decerebrate Capellan grackle

He turned on the radio Emergency he said Any station Spaceshock
case aboard Extreme urgency

Identify yourselfgive your license Over

What port are you

Hunterstownwill you please identify Over

Your coordinates Kennon snapped Over

280456729 plus Repeatrequest your identification

Pilot Kennon Jac Beta 47M 26429 I have no ID for the shipand
youll see why when I land Over

Hunterstown Port to Kennon You are notrepeat notcleared to land
Go into orbit and report your position Over

Sorry Hunterstown You wouldnt have checked in if you didnt have
room and a hospital This is an emergency Im setting down Out

But The words got no farther Kennon was already spinning the ship

All rightwe have you on the scope But this is a class one violation
You may come in on Landing Beam One

Sorry I have no GCA

Whatwhat sort of ship are you flying The voice was curious

Im matching intrinsics over your port Talk me in when I break through
the overcast

Talk you in

Thats right My instruments are obsolete

Great Halstead What else

I have an Ion drive Plus two radioactive

Oh noAnd you still want to come in

I have to My passengers in shock Shes going to have a baby

All rightIll try to get you down in one piece

Have an ambulance ready Kennon said

Kennon lowered the Egg through the overcast Ground control picked him
up smoothly and took him down as though it had been rehearsed The Egg
touched down in the radioactive area of the port Decontamination jets
hissed sluicing the ship to remove surface contamination

Ochsner what sort of a ship is that Ground Controls startled voice
came over the annunciator

Its an old one Kennon said

Thats a gross understatement Stand by for boarders Ambulance coming
up

Kennon opened the airlock and two radiationsuited men entered At
least you had sense enough to wear protective clothing in this hotbox
one said as they carefully unwebbed Copper and carried her out of the
lock You wait here The Port Captain wants to see you

Where are you taking her What Center Kennon asked

What should you care Youve nearly killed her The idea of taking
a pregnant woman up in this death trap What in Flemings names the
matter with your brain

I had to Kennon said I had to It was a matter of life and death
For once he thought wryly the cliche was true

The Betans face behind the transparent helmet was disgusted and
unbelieving I hear that sort of thing every day he said Am I
supposed to believe it

Youd believe it if youd have been where I was Kennon muttered
Nowwhere are you taking her he demanded

The man arched blond eyebrows To the local Medical Centerwhere else
Theres only one in this area

Thanks Kennon said

He watched the ambulance flit off as he waited for the Spaceport Patrol
There was no further need for the protection suit so he peeled it off
and hung it in the controlroom locker Copper was right he mused It
did itch

The Port Captains men were late as usualmoving gingerly through the
radiation area A noncom gestured for him to enter their carryall Port
Captain wants to see you he said

I know Kennon replied

You should have waited upstairs

I couldnt It was a matter of medicine Kennon said

The noncoms face sobered Why didnt you say so All you said was that
it was an emergency

Ive been away I forgot

You shouldnt have done that Youre a Betan arent you

Kennon nodded

They drove to the Port Office where Kennon expectedand gota bad
time from the port officials He filled out numerous forms signed
affidavits explained his unauthorized landing showed his spacemans
ticket defended his act of piloting without an uptodate license
signed more forms entered a claim for salvage rights to the Egg and
finally when the Legal Division the Traffic Control Division the
Spaceport Safety Office Customs Immigration and Travelers Aid had
finished with him he was ushered into the presence of the Port Captain

The redfaced chunky officer eyed him with a cold stare Youll be
lucky young man if you get out of this with a year in Correction Your
story doesnt hang together

It didnt Kennon thought But there was no sense telling all of it to
a Port Captain Under no circumstances could the man be any help to him
He had neither the power nor the prestige to request a Brotherhood Board
of Inquiry In rank he was hardly more than a glorified Traffic Control
officer It would do no good to tell him an improbable tale of slavery
on a distant planet The only thing to do was wait out the storm and
hope it would pass If worst came to worst hed use his rank but hed
made enough stir already He doubted if the Captain had authority to
order him into Detentionbut he was certain to get a lecture These
minor officials loved to tell someone off He gritted his teeth Hed
endure it for Coppers sakeand to get out of here quietly Alexander
would undoubtedly have agents posted by now and his only chance for
temporary freedom of action was to get out of here with as little fuss
as possible

He sat quietly his flushed face and tight jaw muscles betraying his
impatience as the Captain paced up and down and talked on and on The
man sounded like he could go for hours With increasing impatience
Kennon listened to the cadenced flow of complaint and condemnation
occasionally inserting a Yes sir or Sorry sir or No sir as the
words flowed around him

However there had to be a breaking point somewhere and the monotony
was beginning to wear his temper thin Another five minutes he
reflected was about all he could take

The door chime rang softly

Come in the Port Captain said breaking off in midtirade The change
in his manner was so abrupt that Kennon couldnt help smiling

A young blond man in an internes gray uniform entered the room

Yes Doctor the Port Captain said What can I do for you

Do you have a Jac Kennon here Dr Jac Kennon

Did you say doctor the Port Captain said in a halfstrangled voice

You never let me tell you Kennon said mildly that my landing here
was a matter of medicine Technically you have contributed to a delay in
treatment

The Port Captains face paled Why didnt you say something he said

Against your gale of wind I would be but a faint breeze Kennon said
coldly He turned to the interne Im Dr Kennon They bowed formally
to each other

Im Smalley sir from the medical center Dr Brainard sends his
compliments and requests that you join him for consultation

The Port Captain Kennon began

Dont worry about it Doctor Ill relinquish responsibility to Dr
Brainard the Captain said

I have placed a formal written request with your office Smalley said
stiffly You are relieved of further charge Dr Kennon is urgently
needed It is a matter of medicine

The Captain looked relieved On Beta it was poor policy to interfere
with the doings of doctors and engineersor even doctors of philosophy

Very well Hes yoursand Im glad to be rid of him The Port Captain
bowed to Kennon and Smalley and stalked out of the office

Pompous little man Kennon observed but he certainly can talk

Ohyou know these Administrative people the interne said
depreciatingly One mustnt mind them Theyre necessary nuisances
He eyed Kennon curiously How is it that you didnt stand on your
professional rights

I have my reasonsbut they have nothing to do with medicine

OhI see Ethical The internes voice was faintly sarcastic

Manners Doctormanners Kennons voice was gentle but the interne
flushed a dull red

Sorry sir

Dont mention it Its normal for a graduate to confuse liberty with
license Kennon smiled Dont worry I shant report you

Thats good of you sir Smalleys face registered relief Demerits
were difficult to eraseparticularly ones of courtesy

Kennon wondered if the young man would report himself He doubted it
The interne didnt look the typeprobably he was dated for some obscure
job like a general practitioner He shrugged It took all kinds to make
a profession Even the Smalleys had their place

That girl you brought in Smalley said as they entered a white
car emblazoned with the three crosses red blue and green that
represented the three fields of medicine Shes an interesting case
Ive never seen space shock before And the patient herselfone would
hardly believe she was a Betan

She isnt Kennon said

So Blond eyebrows rose in inverted Us of surprise But thats
hardly possible Our tests indicate

Dont you think that this is a matter for Dr Brainard Kennon said
icily Protocol

Of course Stupid of mebut the case is so interesting Half the
center staff have seen her already I wasnt proposing to discuss the
case It wouldnt be proper Even though you are only a veterinarian

Only Kennons voice was hard I shouldnt have to remind you of
this Mr Smalleybut I have been for the past two years on a world of
bad manners I expected better here at home

Smalley flushed to the roots of his strawcolored hair Sorry Doctor
he muttered I dont know whats the matter with me

I can tell you Kennon said Youve just graduated

How did you know Smalley said

I was a graduate once myselfnot too long ago

How long sir

Class of Eightyseven

Thats twelve years ago Smalley said

Kennon nodded Ten years lost Not badnot bad at all But Alexander
could have done a lot in ten years

I meant no disrespect Smalley said worriedly

I know it But if you intend to practice on Beta youd better
polish your professional manner Now where I was it didnt make much
difference Laymen often called me Doc

Smalley was properly shocked I hope you didnt encourage them sir

It was impossible to discourage them Kennon said After all when
the man who hires you

Ohentrepreneurs Smalley said in a tone that explained everything

  

The car stopped in front of the Medical Centers staff entrance This
way sir Smalley said He led the way down a greentiled corridor
to an elevatorthen down another corridor past a pair of softfooted
nurses who eyed them curiouslylooking at Kennons tunic and sandals
with mild disapproval in their eyes Smalley stopped and knocked softly
on a closed door

Enter said a pleasant baritone voice from the annunciator

Dr BrainardDr Kennon Smalley said

Kennon liked the man instantly A plump pinkcheeked man of middle
age with prematurely white hair Dr Will Brainard combined a fatherly
appearance with an impression of quick intelligence The fat that
sheathed his stocky body had obviously not touched his mind Brainard
rose from the deep chair near the window where he had been sitting
knocked the ashes from his pipe and bowed stiffly His eyessharp
points of blue in the smooth pinkness of his facesurveyed Kennon
curiously

So youre the young man who takes untrained pregnant women for rides in
oldfashioned spacers he said Didnt you know what would happen

I was in a hurry Doctor Kennon said

Obviously Now tell me about it Brainard looked at the eagerfaced
interne standing behind Kennon That will be all Smalley he said

Kennon waited until the door closed Ordinarily he said Id never
have done a thing like that but there were some very pressing reasons
However I should have given her an injection of Somnol before we
started Im criminally liable If anything happens to her His voice
was tight with worry

Youd give her an injection Brainard said I hope you didnt mean
that

But I did sir Ive given thousands of Lani injections

Whats a Lani

She is sir The impression has been that her race isnt human

Nonsenseits obvious she is

A Brotherhood Court of Inquiry didnt think so

Hmm Is that so

Yes sirBut before I go on tell me how is she

Oh shell be fine A little mental therapy and plenty of rest are all
she needs Shes a remarkably healthy young woman But this is beside
the point There are a number of unusual features about this case that
need investigation Brainard took a standard hospital form from his
desk Mind if I ask you some questions Doctor

Not at all but you are due for some unpleasant shocks as you go through
that form

I believe I can survive them Brainard said dryly

This is professional confidence Kennon began

Of course of course Brainard said impatiently Now lets get on
with it

  

This is the most amazing tale Ive ever heard Brainard said slowly
Are you certain you are telling the truth

Kennon grinned I dont blame you for not believing mebut the
evidence is conclusive and there is enough documentary evidence in
the space shipand in the fact of the ship itself to prove what I am
saying Laboratory tests here will establish the fact that Coppers
child is also mine And as for Flora a Brotherhood Investigation Team
can prove that part

That will be attended to Brainard said grimly

But how did you deduce she wasnt from a Betan colony Kennon asked

Brainard smiled That wasnt hard Her sun tan and the condition of her
feet proved she was a practicing nudist No Betan girl ever practices
nudism to my knowledge Besides the ID tattoo under her left arm and
the V on her hip are no marks of our culture Then there was another
thingthe serological analysis revealed no gerontal antibodies She
had never received an injection of longevity compound in her life This
might occur but its highly improbable The evidence indicates that
shes extraBetan

Kennon nodded

But this business of her being fifteen years old Thats impossible
She has the development of a woman of twentyfive

Remember the Alpha V colony Kennon said




Of courseohI see It could be something like that
Certainlystrong yellow Gtype sunan isolated colony serviced at
twentyyear intervalsthere was a marked physical precocity

And if this had been continued for several millennia Kennon asked

HmmI see Yes its possible On Alpha V the colonists grew from
infancy to maturity in fifteen years

And wasnt Heaven one of our early colonies

Yesit was established after the Great Schism near the end of the
First Millenniumwhen science and religion split irrevocably on this
world We packed the whole lot of them off to a world of their own where
they could develop as they pleased They called it Heavenodd name for
a fogworldbut theres no accounting for tastes Brainard chuckled

I thought that was the case but I couldnt remember My ancient
history is pretty weak

You should read more Brainard said But as I see itthis girl is of
Betan ancestry providing your theory and the facts coincide

Which could also explain why an outworld species of agerone would be
toxic They tried to prolong Lani life and met with failure Our plants
are mutant forms

Just as we are a mutant race Brainard said or partly mutant He
sighed You have brought us a great deal of trouble Kennon You are
bringing matters to a head If our investigations prove your statements
we are morally bound to open the Lani question And if those people are
of Betan originthat fellow Alexander will have plenty to answer for

I dont believe it is really his fault Kennon said slowly I dont
think he has ever known the truth

Why didnt you tell him

The answer to that should be obvious Even though I trusted him
completely I could never be sure He has a Free Trader background
and those people cant he trusted where moneys concerned The whole
Kardonian culture is an outgrowth of Free Traderism small business
independent corporation linear trusts and all the cutthroat
competition such a culture would naturally have Its a regular jungle
of Free Enterprise I couldnt predict how he would react He could
either act in a moral manner and make restitution or he could quietly
cut our throats and go on with his business

I see The temptation to cut a throat might be overwhelming

They fight commercial wars Kennon said

Disgustingutterly uncivilized Under the circumstances you had no
other course Still they have no moral right to enslave human beings

There is always the element of doubt Maybe they didnt know After
all an impartial court declared the Lani alienand the Betan mutation
isnt known throughout the Brotherhood

One doesnt go around broadcasting data on the variations of ones germ
plasm Brainard said Thats a private affaira matter of personal
privacy

And public safety

Brainard nodded Were no more courageous than any other civilization
We have no desire to borrow trouble We are content to leave things
alone

Thats the trouble Kennon said Were all content to leave things
alone If I hadnt found the spaceship Id not have been able to lay
aside my moral conditioning And if I had not Copper would not have
become pregnant and forced me into these drastic actions Its even
possible that I would have done nothing He grimaced And when I left
Alexanders employment mnemonic erasure would have removed all memory of
the Lanis human origin He shrugged I still am not certain that it
wouldnt have been the wiser course Naturally once I knew I couldnt
do anything else than what I did

Naturally Brainard said Humanity reaches the heights when it faces
questions of moral responsibility

To mankind Kennon added heavily We have a convenient blind spot
regarding our moral responsibility to other intelligent races

A harsh fact but trueand who is to judge whether it is right or
wrong We achieved dominance of Earth by our moral responsibility to
family tribe and nationand we nearly exterminated ourselves when
we forgot that this responsibility went beyond nations and embraced
all mankind We learned that after the Exodus As for the other
racesperhaps someday we will learn moral responsibility for all
intelligencebut we are not ready for that yet Thats too big a mental
hurdle Brainard sighed We are what we are and we change slowly But
we change

True enough Kennon said But its hard to be philosophical about
it

Youre young Live a couple of centuries and you will understand
patience

Kennon smiled

You know Brainard said thoughtfully you still have plenty of things
to do

I know Ill have to make a transcript of this discussion have
it witnessed and make a sealed record I have to arrange for the
reposition of the evidence inside the Egg and a complete recording of
the Egg itself

And to be safe youll need several facsimiles properly attested The
arms of these outworld entrepreneurs are long and unfortunately not all
Betans are models of honesty

Id better get started then

Let me help you Brainard said I have a little influence in this
areaand your cause interests me He picked up the phone on his desk

Kennon sighed He had found an ally



CHAPTER XIX

What are you going to do with that girl Brainard asked

Formalize our mating as soon as she is able to get out of bed Kennon
replied

She is an ignorant untrained savage Brainard protested You should
hear the stories the nurses tell about her

Kennon chuckled You dont have to tell me about those Ive lived with
Lani for two years But shes not stupid

What are your plans

After we establish her humanity legally Kennon said Im going to
send her to school

For twenty years

If necessary But I dont think it will take that long She has some
schooling

But no trainingand what of the Lani in the meantime

I have plans for that Im going back to Kardon and give Alexander a
chance to make restitution I think he is an honorable man Slavery may
be as revolting to him as it is to any civilized human He deserves a
chance to rectify his grandfathers error

That is reasonableand in the best traditions of the Brotherhood

Furthermore its practical Kennon said Alexander is the only one
fully qualified to handle the problems of enfranchisement Hes known
the Lani all his life and he is an executive type A Brotherhood
committee would probably botch the whole affair What with colonial
jurisdiction territorial rights and all the legal quibbling that
committees love the Lani would get a poor deal And theres no reason
to wreck the lives of a couple of hundred million Kardonians because
the rightful owners of Kardon were illegally enslaved That happened
too long ago to have any practical meaning There are other and better
solutions

What

How should I know Kennon asked But Im sure Alexander will Thats
his field

All you have to worry about is whether hell cooperate Brainard
said

Hell cooperate once he knows the score Kennon said confidently
And hell have to make some form of restitution But it shouldnt
involve Kardon Actually the Lani were never in a position to develop
that world Theyd probably have remained on Flora indefinitely The old
court records showed no tendency for their culture to expand They
were an inbred group a static balanced society in harmony with their
environment In nearly thirtyfive hundred years their numbers increased
only to a few thousand Actually there is a good possibility that the
race would ultimately have died out if Old Alexander hadnt enslaved
them and instituted a controlled breeding program There are more Lani
alive today than there were at the height of their power So in a way
Old Alexander did them a favor He kept their race alive All we can
expect is a fair and just settlement

But if Alexander doesnt cooperate

Thats where you come in Youll be a watchdog If you dont receive
annual progress reports from meand see or talk to me personally every
second year you are released from our bond and can do what you wish
with the evidence Ive accumulated

Wed better get this into Private Record Brainard said We can
transcribe an agreement and place it in the Public Repository

A good idea and wed better waste no time Alexander might still be
looking for meand if he is its merely a question of time before he
catches up

Ten years have passed Its doubtful But we could keep you here at the
Center

Kennon shook his head Too dangerous And besides it would compromise
you Nowell get everything possible done to make the Lanis case
airtight and then Ill return to Kardon It will put our case in
a better light if it ever comes to trial if I go back voluntarily
AnywayIm morally bound to return Now lets make this record

Its your decision Brainard said And its your neckbut I must
admit that I agree with you

Ill feel safer when we get the legal details clarified Kennon said

And what of the girl

Can you take care of her if I have to leave quickly

Of course Ill give her personal attention and after she has her
child Ill see that she is sent to you

Thats decent of you Doctor

Its my moral responsibility Brainard said as he slipped a new tape
into the recorder

  

Copper responded quickly to rest and therapy The space shock cleared up
quickly The gerontological treatments put her to bed again but within
a month she was completely normal and her lifespan was now that of a
normal human She could look forward to some four hundred years with
Kennonand the prospect was not unpleasant The Center fascinated her
Never before had she seen a hospital devoted to the care and
treatment of humans It was a far cry in its polished steel and stone
magnificence from the tiny primitive structure over which Kennon had
presided Yet both places served the same purpose Perhaps Kennon was
rightthat there was no difference between man and Lani The idea was
not nearly as unbelievable as it was at first

I never realized what it meant to be human Copper said as she held
Kennons hand It is nice to feel important and to know that our child
is a member of the race that rules the galaxy

So youre convinced Kennon chuckled

The serological identity she began

Hmm Youve been getting some education I see

Well Copper smiled I didnt think you wanted a stupid woman I can
readand since you are around so seldom nowadays there is little else
to do Ive been reading history medicine and novels she finished
proudly

A fine catholic selection Kennon said Now if you add mathematics
sociology and philosophy youll have a wellrounded basic education

Dr Brainard has been trying something he calls hypno He says it
will help me learn faster But I cant see that its done much good

You wont until you need the information Kennon said

That technique is only good for implanting basic knowledge and much of
that will merely supplement or complete that which you already have You
wont be conscious of it

OhI think I see what you mean

Of course youll have to continue your formal education Theres a
great deal for you to learn It should keep you busy while Im away

Away Where are you going

Back to Kardon

But you cant Alexander will destroy you

I think not After all ten years have elapsed since we left there and
hes had plenty of time to think Douglas must have told him about us
I wouldnt be surprised if he has already done something about your
people

She shivered He mightbut the question is what would he do He could
have killed them all

Kennon shook his head I dont think so He never struck me as a mass
murderer

She shook her head You dont know the Alexanders like I do I was
raised by them Theyre capable of anything But what is this business
of ten years Thats silly I havent had my child yetand it doesnt
take ten years of pregnancy to produce a baby

Its the difference between subjective and objective time Kennon
said We traveled here through hyperspacelow Cthin an uncompensated
ship and there is little temporal flow in the levels below the blue

Ohof course

Kennon chuckled That would have been Greek to you a couple of weeks
ago See where that basic data fits

But Ive always known that

You just think you have Search your memory and see if Im not right

Copper shook her head Its very strange she said But thats not
important This idea of going back to Kardon thoughthats a different
thingthat is important

I have to do it Not only because its a personal moral obligation but
also because of the Lani They must have their freedom

Providing there are any still alive

Stop being a calamity howler Whatever Alexander may be hes not a
butcher He even loved a Lani once You told me so yourself And he
couldnt kill where he loved

She nodded I suppose youre right but Ive never lost my fear of the
Man Alexander He held the power of life and death over me But if you
must go then I should go too My obligation is greater than yours

Later Kennon said Youre not ready to return It will be time
enough after you have learned some civilized habits

Coppers face lengthened You mean like wrapping myself in cloth like
these people do

Thats part of it

Why cant they be sensibleor are they so ashamed of what the gods
gave them that they must hide themselves

No its not that At least not exactly Its custom And you must
learn to conform to customsoutwardly at leastno matter what you may
really think

Isnt that a form of lying Copper asked

I suppose so

Isnt that strange Your society exalts truth honor morality and
intelligenceyet you lie about your attitude

Its called diplomacy Kennon said Its part of respect for others
attitudes and beliefs a necessary part of human relationships

Then youd be a nudist on Santos

Of courseeven though I think it isnt proper I couldnt inflict my
ideas and attitudes on the customs of an independent world

Ohyou think Im doing that

Yesand it is a mark of barbarism

Sometimes youre not very nice Copper said

Kennon smiled wryly I suppose Im not he agreed

Ill try to be civilized Copper said But if you go to KardonIm
going with you

Perhaps Kennon said Well see how things turn out

You dont want me to go with you

To be honestno Kennon said Youre safe here and until your
status is cleared by a Brotherhood court I wouldnt care to place you
in Alexanders hands And clearing your status is going to take time

You mean that I am still his property

Yes But there is a legal doubt that will prevent him from exercising
his claim as long as you stay on Beta In the area where he has power
that doubt might not hold So until your status is definitely proven to
be human you should not leave

And what happens if this court denies my claim

Then we appeal to the Council However with the evidence we have your
claim cannot reasonably be denied The only question is one of time It
may take years Still I dont think there is anything to worry about I
dont think Alexander will give us any trouble but theres no sense in
taking chances

You still think Im a Lani she said accusingly

I do not

Then you think that Id obey Alexander after what I did to Douglas

I can only repeat that Douglas isnt the Bossman

I wish I knew what you really thought

That isnt hard I think you should stay here until I get this business
straightened out

Thats all she asked suspiciously After all I know Im not very
pretty now And theres lots of Lani on Flora

Oh for Ochsners sake Do you think that Im He paused speechless
Just what do you think I am

Youre a man And thats the trouble

Kennon chuckled So thats it You dont trust me

I love you Copper said

Sometimes I wonder why men ever finalize their status with women
Kennon murmured It does no good It doesnt convince the woman Shes
still fearful jealous and suspiciousalways belittling her ability
to hold what she has always alert for competition clinging holding
absorbingwhen she should be working as part of a team

Thats not true

Then prove it

Howby staying here while you go to the end of the galaxy and play
noble

Im only doing what I have to do

And so am Iand if you go Im going with you

Kennon shrugged There was no sense arguing The only thing to do was
make his plans and leave quietly If she was faced with an established
fact she might be more reasonable He doubted it but alone she could
do nothingand Brainard would see that she was comfortable The salvage
money from the Egg would keep her from being a public charge And he had
more banked in Albertsville which he could send her once he got there
Hed start making plans to leave as soon as possible

Copper looked up at him as he stood above her bed Slowly she reached
out and placed one slim hand in his I know what you are thinking she
said and her face twisted in a grimace of pain and the hand in his
clutched with convulsive strength at his fingers

Whats the matter he said

Nothingits perfectly normal she said Im just going to give you
a son Now if youd call for the doctor perhaps we can get this over
That pain was only twenty minutes from the last I think its about
time

Kennonwho had attended several hundred Lani births and had developed a
certain callousness about themwas suddenly frightened and helpless
as he pushed the call button He could feel the cold sweat form on his
forehead He had started this It was his fault if anything went wrong
He wished that it was someone else rather than Copper who was going
through this trial He was nervous unsure and guilty In a word he
felt like a man whose mate was giving birth to their first child

  

Its a boy Dr Brainard said He smiled down at Kennons haggard
face

How is Copper Kennon asked

Fineshes healthy as a horse

Kennon winced at the cliche It was so ancient that it had lost all
meaning Most Betans didnt know what a horse was let alone whether
it was healthy or not From what Kennon could remember of veterinary
history the horse wasnt too healthy an animal It was rather delicate
in fact

How is the child Kennon asked It took a little courage to ask this
question The baby could be anything from normal to a monstrosity

Perfectly normal Brainard said A true Betan type even down to the
vestigial tail We amputated that of course

Thank Ochsner Kennon breathed I was afraid

Of course you were Brainard said Do you want to see them now When
I left Copper was asking for you

Kennon sighed Leaving he realized wasnt going to be as easy as he
had thought

Well have to keep them here for a couple of months Brainard said
We must take exhaustive tests if we expect the court to reverse its
prior decision

I expected that Kennon said He shrugged Its probably best he
said Now show me where Copper is

Shes back in the same room You dont need a guide

Kennon didnt In fact he behaved quite admirably



CHAPTER XX

Longliners Kennon reflected didnt make Beta a port of call and the
Shortliner connections with other worlds were infrequent Beta had done
a good job separating from the rest of the Brotherhood Too good The
spaceline schedules showed only one departure in the next month a
Shortliner for Earth and from Earth the road to Kardon was long and
tortuous involving a series of short jumps from world to world and a
final mediumrange hop from Halsey to Kardon If everything went right
and he made every connection he would be in Kardon four months after he
left Beta Kennon sighed as he left Travelers Aid Morality was a heavy
load to carry

He walked slowly down the road from the spaceport toward the
Cooperative where he had been staying He had left Huntersville and
Copper a week ago after he had seen his child His child The thought
of being a father was oddly dismaying It distorted his sense of values
But one thing was certain He was returning to Kardon and Copper was
not coming with him She had a duty to their sonand he had a duty to
his contract with Alexander to the Lani on Flora and to Copperand
none of these could be satisfied by further running He had to return
and settle the account

A tall man in a conservative yellowandblack suit was waiting patiently
in front of his room My name is Richter he said Art Richter Are
you Dr Jac Kennon

I could deny it but I wont Kennon said

Thank you Doctor It was just a formality anyway You see I know
you by sight He sighed One has to observe the formalities in this
business He drew a long white envelope from his tunic and handed it to
Kennon Most of my subjects try to deny their identity he said

Its a refreshing change to find an honest man He bowed formally
I really thought this would be harder considering the charges against
you He bowed again and walked away

Nowwhat was that Kennon muttered as he opened the envelope The
man Richter was undoubtedly a process serverbut who had hired him
He unfolded the sheet and scanned the chargescoercion larceny
livestock theft and breach of contract He shrugged This was
Alexanders work What was the man thinking of It was insanity to
bring the Lani matter into open court Hadnt Douglas told him what had
happened Couldnt Alexander guess that he had fled with Copper for a
good reasonone that would stand up in court Didnt he know about the
spacer Or had Douglas turned on his cousin The pup had so many hates
that it was possible He was a natural troublemaker Maybe Alexander
didnt know Maybe he was working in the dark Kennon scanned the sheet
quickly Ah here it was ComplaintMr Alexander X M Alexander
Skyline Tower 1024 Beta City

Alexander Here on Beta Kennon opened the door of his room went
straight to the phone beside the bed He lifted the handset from its
cradle and dialed the operator Get me Huntersville THU 21408 I want
to speak to Dr Brainard Dr Will Brainard This is a priority
callmy name is Kennon Dr Jac Kennon DVM Im in the registry47M
26429yesof course and thank you He waited a moment HelloDr
BrainardKennon here Ive just had some news Alexanders on Beta
Yeshe served me with a summons Can you get a restraining order to
prevent him from leaving You can Good Heres his address Kennon
rattled off the location YesIm taking the next airboat to Beta
City This should simplify things considerablyOf course it should He
was a fool to have come here YesI suppose you should tell Copper
Oh She is Im sorry to hear that but theres no reason for her to
be angry She should realize that I did this for hernot to make her
miserable HmmSheshe has You think she should come with
meYes I realize she can be a problem when she wants to be All right
thentell her to pack a toothbrush and a few spare diapers And see if
you can get me a couple of tickets on the next flight to Beta City Ill
be over in a couple of hours and pick her up He cradled the phone and
dialed the operator again

I want the phone number of Skyline Tower 1024 Beta City Mr
Alexander Yes Ill wait This number is HUV 21278 and my name
is Kennon Dr Jac Kennon 47M 26429 I called you before No Im a
transient I can refer you to Dr James Brainard Huntersville Medical
Center Yes Ill accept charges Now will you give me that number BCA
78941thank you

Kennon hung up dialed the number and waited

Hello he said Mr Alexander This is Dr KennonYesI suppose
you do but Ive been trying to get back to Kardon for the past month
You are Well thats your privilege but Id advise you to go easy
until I see you NaturallyIm coming as soon as I can get there Well
be seeing you tomorrow morning at the latest WeIm bringing Copper
of course I just wanted you to know

Kennon wiped his forehead Alexander sounded angry and dangerous Ten
years hadnt served to cool him off What had happened on Kardon after
he had left Kennon shook his head There was something here he didnt
understand The entrepreneur should have been covering his tracks not
threatening jail and disaccreditation It was obvious that a personal
visit was more necessary than he had thought

Alexander was waiting His eyebrows rose at the sight of Copper in
formal Betan dressand lifted a trifle more at the sight of the baby

What is this Kennon he asked

Trouble Kennon said He took off his hat I came here to settle
things before you took this case to court You obviously do not
understand what has happened I suppose Douglas has doublecrossed you
It would be characteristic of him But before we go any further I think
we should clear the air and let each other know where we stand I
dont want to make trouble if its not necessary Youll notice Im not
wearing a thought screen so youll be able to check everything I say
and know Im telling the truth

It had better be good Alexander said grimly Ive been looking for
you for ten years I intend to throw the book at you

I dont know whether my reason is good or not Technically Im guilty
of breach of contract and larceny of corporation property but there are
extenuating circumstances

Alexander chuckled mirthlessly There are a few other charges And
quite probably I can think of more if you beat these Im going to make
an example of you Kennon Im going to drag you down and stamp on you
Youre going to be a horrible example to all smart operators who think
they can break contracts Its taken a million credits and ten years
time to hunt you down but its going to be worth it

Coppers child is a boy Kennon said mildly My son

Alexander froze You can prove that he asked in a halfstrangled
voice

Kennon nodded You see the extenuating circumstance he asked
Suppression of human slavery

Alexander sat down It was as though some unseen hand had pulled his
legs from under him You believe it he said Noyouve proved
it Whywhy didnt you tell me What sort of a man do you think I am

I didnt know I couldnt take the chance until Copper was protected
You see sir I love her

That isnt hard to do with Lani Alexander said He sank back in his
chair his face clouded his expression troubled It was obvious that
the realization shocked him

Kennon felt an odd sympathy for the entrepreneur It wasnt a nice
feeling he suspected to have the beliefs of a lifetime ripped apart
and sent to the disposal chute

So the Lani are a human variant Alexander said dully

The proof is here Kennon said and the supporting evidence is
conclusive

Which makes mewhat A murderer A slaver A tyrant Alexander
clutched his head with leanfingered hands What am I

An innocent victim of circumstances Kennon said You didnt know
None of us knew And we still wouldnt know if the Lani werent of
Betan extraction He grimaced painfully Ive done some soulsearching
myself and it hasnt been a pleasant task

But its nothing like mine Alexander said in a low voice I
suspected they were human when I was younger but I denied my suspicions
and accepted false facts instead of investigating

You would have found nothing

Unfortunately thats not true We discovered quite a bit from the
experimental station you left us when you disappeared ten years ago But
we stopped when we found the age that was being indoctrinated with Lani
tabus We could have gone farther but I didnt think it was necessary

Didnt Douglas tell you Kennon asked curiously I told him when I
turned him loose

Douglas didnt tell anything except that you had somehow gotten a
spaceship I assumed it was one of those that were involved in that
commercial raid a few decades ago but I see it wasnt NoI knew
nothing about this development And Douglas I guess wanted to keep
it hidden He gave your coordinates and ordered Mullins to launch a
missile But he apparently forgot to turn on his IFF At any rate
the missile lost youbut found Douglas Douglas was still talking to
Alexandria when it struck

He might have informed you Kennon said If he had more time

I doubt it He ordered the missile first He was trying to destroy you
before you could destroy Outworld Enterprises His motives were selfish
as usual Alexander looked at Kennon with a haggard eye I owe you an
apology he said Ive considered you responsible for Douglass death
for ten years Ive searched for you on a hundred worlds My agents in
every branch office have had standing orders to report any unusual
arrivals I have hunted you personally I wanted to break youI wanted
to kill you

I couldnt help the delay Kennon said The ship was old

I know Youve told me more than you think Im a telepath you know

Ive never forgotten it Kennon said That was one of the principal
reasons I came here I wanted to see how youd react when you learned
the whole truth

And I suppose you gloatnoyoure not doing that But you are right
I could have checked it further But I didnt Outworld Enterprises is
far bigger than Floraand I was busy Galactic trade is a snakepit
And after all there was Douglass deathand the Family with their
neverending clamor for money and their threats when it didnt come
promptly I like being an entrepreneur but until I made Outworld
independent of Family control I couldnt do anything except run the
business to their wishes Actually the island was only a small part of
the corporation I tried to run it as humanely as possible under the
circumstances He shuddered I dont think I was ever needlessly
cruel

No Kennon said you were indifferent

Which is just as bad Alexander said

Wellwhat are you going to do about it Copper interjected You can
beat yourself until youre blue but that wont accomplish anything

What are you going to do Alexander countered You have the upper
hand

Me Copper asked I have nothing This is between you men She
lapsed into silence

Alexander turned back to Kennon You have undoubtedly made some
arrangements You wouldnt come hereoh I see Congratulations
Handling the evidence that way was a wise course You have my
admiration But then I should have known that I was not dealing with a
fool He smiled wryly Subconsciously I think I did knowbut

Thats one consolation Kennon grinned To be thought a rascal is bad
enough but to be considered a fool is intolerable

But your decision not to use the evidence unless you were forced
tothats poor business

But good morals Kennon said Neither the Brotherhood nor I could
settle this affair It is a matter only you can handle There is
no sense in killing Outworld or throwing Kardon into centuries of
litigation The Lani never were numerous enough to lay claim to an
entire world Ill admit the club is there but Ill never use it unless
its necessary

Why notits sound business practice

Im a professionalnot a businessman And besides I havent the moral
right to return evil for good You have not been a bad boss

Thanks Alexander said glumly Ive always considered myself
civilized

I wouldnt go so far as to say that Kennon said Honorable
yescivilized no But none of us are really civilized

So

We havent changed much despite our development Perhaps weve varied
a little physicallyand weve learned to use new tools but our minds
are still the minds of barbariansblood brothers against the enemy and
everything not of us is enemy Savageshiding under a thin veneer
of superficial culture Savages with spaceships and the atom Kennon
looked down at Copper Apparently her thoughts were miles away in an
introspective world that was all her own She had said her piece and
having done that was content to let the two men develop it Kennon
looked at her with odd respect Alexander eyed her with a mildly
startled expression on his lean face And both men smiled but the
smiles were not amused

Judging from Copper Alexander said I dont think well have to
worry about how the Lani will turn out He looked at Kennon with mild
sympathy You are going to have quite a time with her he said

I suppose so Ill probably never know whether Im guided or whether
Im doing the guiding Ive changed a lot of my opinions about Copper
since the day I met her

Copper looked up and smiled at them It was an odd smile hinting at
secrets neither of them would ever know Alexander chuckled It serves
you right He crossed his legs and looked up at Kennon standing before
him By some uncanny legerdemain he had gotten control of himself
and the situation at the same time Being telepathic was an unfair
advantage Kennon thought

You were equally unfair with your accusation Alexander said
Surehumanity makes mistakes and like this one theyre sometimes
brutal mistakes But we are capable of atonement Morally we have come a
long way from the brutality of the Interregnum I shouldnt have to use
examples but look at thathe waved at the view wall at the panorama
of gleaming fairy towers and greenery that made Beta City one of the
most beautiful in the Brotherhood Dont tell me that five thousand
years of peace and development havent produced civilization Thats a
concrete example out there

It isnt Kennon said flatly Sure its prettycleanand
beautifully designed for art and utilitybut it isnt civilization
Youre confusing technology with culture You look at this and say
What a great civilization man has built when you really mean What
a great technology mankind has developed Theres all the difference in
the world Technology is of the mind and hands Civilization is of the
spiritand spiritually we are still in the Dark Ages

We conquer kill loot and enslave We establish standards to keep
humanity a closed corporation a special club in which men can live but
aliens cant Weve made the standards for admission so rigid that
we even enslave our own kind and call them animals Thats not
civilizationthats savagery

For nearly five hundred years your family has run a slave pen Your
fortune is based upon it And you have perpetuated this traffic in flesh
on the specious reasoning that a court judgment of half a millennium ago
is as good today as when it was handed down Never once did anyone have
the moral courage to reexamine that old decision Never once did any
human question the rightness of that decision None of us are immune
We all based our conduct upon an antiquated law and searched no further
Everyone was happy with the status quoor at least not so unhappy that
they wanted to change it Even I would have been content had it not been
for Copper

Yet I do not feel that it was bad that I hired you Alexander said
Even though you have shown me that I am a slaver and made me see
faults I never knew I had His face was drawnharsh lines reached from
nose to lips from eyes to chin Suddenly he looked old I can accept
censure if censure is just And this is just NoIm not sorry I hired
you even though the thought of what I have helped do to the Lani makes
me sick to my stomach

Well Kennon said What are you going to do about it

I dont know Alexander said At the first smell of trouble the
Family will turn tail and run You can break the company and I wont
stand in your way Its only just Youre the one whos carrying the
ball Now run with it

That damned blind spot Kennon said You realize of course that
youre not legally liable It was a mistake All you have to do is admit
the error and start from there Naturallyno reasonable intelligence
would expect that you change the older Lani Theyre too old for either
agerone or change It would be both cruel and inhuman to turn them
loose Its with the youngsters that you can workthose who are
physically and physiologically young enough to derive benefit from
agerone and education

As I remember you bought a planet called Phoebe Now why dont you

Phase out Of course But that means that you cant press charges

Why should I Im not one of these starryeyed reformers who expect
to change things overnight Its the future of the Lani race thats
important And Brainard agrees with me A phaseout is the proper
solution Change the education let males be bornteach the young to
think instead of to obey Give them Phoebe for a homethey never owned
all of Kardon anyway And within a century or two we will have a new
group of the human raceand then we can tell the Brotherhood

Kennon looked inquiringly at Copper She smiled and nodded It would
cause less trouble that way she said It would be more sureand
there are never too many old ones

Kennon shuddered thinking of the euthanasia chambers on Otpen One
There will be more from now on he said

Outworld can afford it Itll bend us a little but we wont breakand
besides the Lani will need our help for some time to come Alexander
looked at Kennon Can we make an agreement that all parties will
respect he asked

I think soproviding there are no sleeper clauses in it Kennon said

There wont be Alexander said

And there werent

  

It was a private ceremony The Family sulky and unwilling faced with
a choice of drastically reduced income or outright confiscation and
preferring a portion of a loaf to none Alexandergrim but oddly
peaceful of expression Brainardpinkcheeked and emotionless Kennon
and Copperhappily conscious that it was at last finished It was an
oddly assorted group of conspirators who planned to restore a segment of
humanity to the human race

Kennon signed last and as he did Alexander looked at him with a sly
grin distorting the smooth pallor of his face

You forgot something he said

What Kennon saidaware suddenly that something was wrong

What do you plan to do now that this is over

Join the Medical Center here and practice veterinary medicine

You wouldnt care to work for meto help rebuild the wreckage youve
helped create Ill need a manager on Kardon to phase out the island
while we phase in Phoebe

No thank you Ive had enough of that

You just think you have Alexander said gleefully Thats what you
have forgotten Youve gotten your agreementnow you will satisfy me
As I see it you have breached your contract by leaving Flora without
authorization

That is right Kennon said A small lump of lead began to grow rapidly
larger in his stomach Brainard was grinning and Coppers eyes were
shining Youve been jobbed his mind told him He sighed He knew
what was coming next

The punitive clause for breach of contract Alexander went on
inexorably is very broad Discretion is vested in the entrepreneur I
can obtain judgment against you in any court on any planet

I know Kennon said glumly

But I am going to be civilized Alexander said I am going to be
merciful I am going to extend your contract until phaseout has been
completed You are going to have control of the entire Kardon phase of
the operation Its poetic justiceyou made the messnow you can clean
it up

Thats inhuman

Humanity has nothing to do with it Its justice Alexander said He
smiled at Coppers radiant face The thought of going home was good to
her Good luck on your new job Dr Kennon he said And welcome to
the brotherhood of the ulcer
